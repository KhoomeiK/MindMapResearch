ParallelUniverse,flcdkmc,t3_fixwgi,1585027075.0,Yes. I felt a strange shift right around the 2016 elections. I’d say it was in mid December of 2016. Several friends of mine feel the exact same way. It was a great year for me even though I had a lot of obstacles I felt...myself. Confident and content. It feels like a different world

SpiritualAwakening,fkfj2u8,t1_fkfivcj,1584135512.0,I hear you about the retrograde! Retrograde as always make me feel like I’m slipping back into my old ways and my self sabotaging thoughts and behaviors but we have to remember retrogrades are meant to kind of test us and teach us something! I try to remember that my thoughts create my reality so even if I have to force myself to think I’m feeling good I try to
SpiritualAwakening,fkfigle,t3_fi6etm,1584135114.0,"I totally relate. Enlightenment means you lose a lot of people in your life who have not elevated with you. Maybe not even lose them, but you no longer connect the same way. I too experienced loneliness after my awakening and definitely some depression. I sometimes feel like I’m losing my connection with spirituality as well. But remember there are ups and down and once you awaken you can’t go back to sleep. Your vibe attracts your tribe, so keep vibrating high and you will attract like minded people! You will sound crazy to those who haven’t gotten in touch with their spirituality yet. You are not crazy! Love and blessings ❤️"

BipolarReddit,fjw5etx,t1_fjw580c,1583635463.0,"For sure!!! Thank god for vegan pizza and vegan Mac and cheese hahahah. I like to make chickpeas and kale, sautee them up with olive oil and garlic or lemon pepper seasoning. It’s got carbs fats and lots of protein. And calories! Thanks for mentioning the baked beans I’m gonna have to try them!"
bipolar,fjvzczu,t3_ff1qle,1583632632.0,You look great! Sometimes when I’m depressed I force myself to get dolled up. Even when my confidence is at an all time low it kinda tricks me into wanting to be more productive and leave the house. ❤️❤️❤️
BipolarReddit,fjutnqq,t3_fejs3u,1583620125.0,I hear you!!! I’m also vegan which makes it even harder. Another good thing to hit those calories is avocados!! And oatmeal with peanut butter. Good luck!! ❤️

vegan,fjrcdjs,t3_fes7gd,1583583861.0,"Yes very true! Especially now that climate change is absoloutley undeniable! I have to go back and get my facts straight, but I once saw a comparison of how much water you save from 1 week being vegan versus 6 months of no showering! I will come back and share the statistic so that we can share it because I know that will be staggering for people"
vegan,fjq5h4x,t3_feonc5,1583567917.0,It’s definitely hard to see the lack of knowledge and compassion in society when it comes to veganism. The world has come far but we still have so much farther to go. I try to focus on the growing popularity of plant milks and plant based “meat”. We’re getting there! I know in our lifetime veganism will only grow it will just take more time for people to wake up. I believe eating animal products will one day turn into how we view slavery now versus the past...people will say “what the hell were we doing and why did we think it was ok for so long?????”❤️❤️❤️❤️
AskMen,fjq3vdd,t3_feox3l,1583566968.0,"I try to tell myself “I’m older. I’m wiser. I have more tools in my tool box. I’ve come so far since then. Those people can’t hurt me anymore” I try to personify those memories as someone who is trying to take away my peace and I won’t let them. Let those feelings come to you. But try to understand that we have the present and the future to look forward to. Easier said than done, sending love🙏🏻❤️"
BipolarReddit,fjq3o0n,t3_feilvr,1583566738.0,"I too do not have answers but relate to everything you just said. I wish it was easier to differentiate but unfortunately having bipolar means you have to question feeling good, invade you’re getting hupomanic or manic...and you have to question not feeling good Incase you’re getting depressed. I always wonder if I’m overreacting sometimes I invalidate my own feelings by telling myself I’m being irrational and confrontational to those around me. But we are human too and certain things would upset anybody bipolar or not bipolar"
BipolarReddit,fjpreta,t3_feof2y,1583559098.0,"Yes. I had been drinking daily for 6 months and just recently stopped. I can’t have just one drink, or 2 or 3 or 4. Maybe that’s just me. I start acting very wrexklessly...driving drunk and trying to fight my loved ones. The next day I feel like I got hit by a bus and can’t do anything. It’s a very slippery slope. Detox is expensive. It does not help mood swings or anxiety in the long run in fact it makes it much worse"
BipolarReddit,fjpmqb1,t3_fenk91,1583555028.0,Yeah I get sensitive about a lot of things. But my boyfriend is very understanding he is great. I try to explain why I was hurt cuz I know sometimes I overreact. He is very patient with me and I love him. You just have to be honest and upfront and be with the right person.

BipolarReddit,fjpmlh0,t3_fejs3u,1583554920.0,I lost a lot of weight too because I wouldn’t eat. I try to eat first thing in the morning because it makes me hungrier throughout the day. Olive oil has a lot of calories even in a couple table spoons so I try to drizzle it on everything. Eating is important!!! Sending love ❤️❤️❤️
BipolarReddit,fjkwf5b,t1_fjketpv,1583435238.0,"Thanks for your reply it really helped me feel less alone. I would come to your funeral🙏🏻 being bipolar, it feels like we are tortured souls. But everyone is so connected, if we were gone it would impact a lot of people. My cousin overdosed and died from heroin a couple years back. He felt so alone even though our whole family was grieving when he was gone. I think about the two young boys who were playing Pokémon go and found his body in the park. They showed up at his funeral. I know that impacted them. You are loved ❤️"

BipolarReddit,fjexi9u,t3_fd3t2v,1583280050.0,"I’ve felt like this before. To me it feels like when Dorothy goes to oz and it’s in color instead of black and white. I come out of my depression and almost get mad at myself for wasting my time and life being depressed. I get so passionate about life that being in nature or hearing certain songs will bring me to tears of joy. I feel like I’m wasting my life if I’m not doing something to get ahead. I have this obsessive urge to LIVE. I fall in with myself and even though I haven’t lost or gained weight I feel so secure where as when I was depressed I hated my appearance. Everything just feels good, life feels beautiful"

Drinking either makes me very wreckless and want to be the life of the party to the point where people have to talk me down, or it makes me so angry that I start breaking things and have an urge to become violent. Lamictal and alcohol don’t mix"
BipolarReddit,fjbtpc2,t1_fjbkqlz,1583201198.0,Yeah I hear you I understand the “cycle” all I want to do when I’m manic is go out and party with a bunch of people. Then I realize I don’t have friends
BipolarReddit,fjapg6o,t3_fc7s5m,1583178063.0,I totally agree! There’s less pressure because they understand the need to recharge and be alone for a little bit
vegan,fjae9ku,t1_fj9e6a6,1583171707.0,I’ve watched a lot of videos by people like Earthling Ed to know how to approach people about like how to be informative but not pushy. I try to get them to think in a non judgmental way and just question themselves a little bit. I really try not to come off as a “pushy vegan”. A lot of people start pondering it and are receptive and even though they don’t go vegan you can see their gears turning a little bit. It gives me so much hope! However some people end up getting irritated and are stumped for answers and end up rolling their eyes and saying whatever I’m always gonna enjoy a big fat burger. Some people won’t budge so I back off
BipolarReddit,fja7x73,t3_fc7s5m,1583168206.0,"That’s a good idea to tell them before it happens. That way when it does happen they’re not left wondering and trying to get a hold of you. 

I know what you mean about not being the “fun” friend. I feel like that with my friends as well. I think having bipolar makes us feel more deeply and understand people. We tend to like deep conversations. Everyone needs a friend like us! Plus, we can be so much fun and have such a colorful personality when we are feeling good. Thank you for your comment ❤️"

bipolar,fja366z,t3_fcdgcm,1583165410.0,"Risperidone was my nightmare come true. Tapering off it I got severe akhthisia, and to be honest I’ll never complain about being depressed or anxious again after experiencing a month of akyrhisia. Doctors need to be vocal that 50% of patients on anti psychotics can experience akhthisia."
vegan,fj9430m,t3_fc242s,1583131386.0,"I hear you. My close friend always tries to “poke holes” in my vegan diet and challenge it. It’s kind of jokingly but still annoying. Anyways, she struggles with her weight and sees me eating so healthy and looking/feeling great (thank you veganism!) because we live together. When she’s concerned about her summer body, suddenly she’ll look at my almond milk yogurt and the vegan dishes I make and be intrigued. Only for weight loss though. It bothers me that she challenges the moral aspect of veganism, but then is going out buying the same vegan products as me only to look good. At least she’s eating less meat and helping the animals out! Idk, it just feels like she makes a joke out of veganism but still wants to reap the benefits"
BipolarReddit,fj91rl6,t3_fbzsx9,1583128957.0,"I believe bipolar is a reason for certain behaviors but not an excuse. While it’s not your fault you have bipolar, it still affects those around you. It feels unfair because a lot of things you can’t “control” as it is part of the disorder. What I’ve learned to do, after having friends and family witness many episodes and have to “deal” with me, is when I come down from mania and realize how I behaved, I apologize to the people around me and THANK them for being there for me. It means a lot to them. I also explain my disorder and why I behave the way I do, but in a way that shows I just want to explain myself instead of making excuses. It’s important that they know you didn’t mean any harm and that you are struggling each day with bipolar. Let them know you apologize, you are thankful for them, and that you are struggling with this disorder but are consciously working on it each day. ❤️❤️❤️"
BipolarReddit,fj90tz6,t3_fbzz1v,1583128042.0,"I can relate. It’s hard because I used to have such big dreams and had high standards for myself. Living with bipolar, I’m happy if I get through the day. I try to put a positive swing on things. The young girl I used to be was undiagnosed and not self aware. Having bipolar has forced me to get to know my true self. Now I know how to feel comfortable alone. I only let good people into my life. It’s made me 10x stronger of a person. Maybe life is not what you planned it to be, but it is part of your journey. “Map our your life, but do it in pencil”. We can’t change the cards we are dealt, only how we play those cards. Sending love ❤️"
BipolarReddit,fj8xstx,t3_fc0nw8,1583125269.0,"I suggest taking social media breaks where you delete the app off your phone for a few days but keep your account. You can log back on and check it as you please but it won’t be there to open up the app every 5 minutes. Having Bipolar 1, I feel limited in ways even though I shouldn’t. When I see people graduating college, working high power jobs, having lots of friends, and nice clothes it makes me feel like I could never attain that as Bipolar is very hard to deal with and daily life can be harder for us. It feels like I’m just surviving while everyone else is thriving. It’s very deceiving because we only see the good parts of peoples lives that they choose to post. When you’re scrolling through post after post, it wreaks havoc on your mind and emotions because it seems like everyone else has their lives together and you don’t. It’s simply not true. Try to detach from social media for a bit and work on you. Meditate, drink water, excercise, read, find a fun hobby....become obsessed with yourself and your goals and your health. I never fail to feel like a failure in life after spending a lot of time on social media. Focus on you, we have a lot to be grateful for we are not lacking 🙏🏻❤️"
BipolarReddit,fj8xccp,t3_fc3po6,1583124882.0,I also talk to myself when I’m alone. I’ll imagine a conversation I’m going to have with someone as if I’m actually speaking to them. I’ll also go over past conversations and say out loud what I wish I had said in the conversation. Sometimes when your mind is cluttered it’s easier to talk out loud and get it out. I dont think you are “crazy” ❤️
BipolarReddit,fj8whab,t3_fby83s,1583124164.0,"I quit as well. I smoked from age 14-22 daily and it was always my crutch. When I first started, it relived my extreme anxiety instantly and all my negative thoughts seemed to melt away and I gained new perspectives on life. When I started taking bipolar meds however, I’d experience panick attacks, derealization, depersonalization and paranoia. I’d also get disorganized speech and thinking and would jumble my words in social situations. I sometimes would feel like I switched into different personalities when I was really high, it’s hard to explain I would talk different and have different body posture. Days blended together and I was just floating through life not motivated to do anything. I continued to smoke though, because it was all I knew to help anxiety and I had been doing it so long that it took me a while to accept it was doing more harm than good at this point. I haven’t smoked in 5 months. I used to smoke everyday all throughout the day. I have more energy, waaaaasy less anxiety, I feel like I’m “in real life”, I feel in control of myself and my thoughts more. Social situations don’t make me as anxious because I’m fully present and can socialize as myself and feel in control of how I’m perceived by other people. It’s the best choice I made for myself. Yesterday I took one hit of a blunt at a parry and it was awful. Head spun, heart raced, mind raced, I started having disturbing thoughts, I didn’t know how to sit comfortable in my body and act “normal”. Horrible experience. Sometimes it’s time to outgrow things even if they once helped us"

BipolarReddit,fj22x0p,t3_faypb9,1582933231.0,"I was on lithium and lamictal for 5 years. One day, after them not helping with my depression for all those years  (even tho they were successful at keeping me from being manic), I decided to stop one day. At the time I thought I was having a spiritual awakening by coming off them. I suddenly KNEW I was destined to be famous   I started writing rap lyrics even though I had zero talent looking back. I thought I was gonna be a star. I thought angels were sending me messages. I started meeting with sugar daddies and within 3 months I was doing coke everyday. I put up embarrassing Snapchat stories of me singing that at the time I thought people would see I’m a star. I racked up $800 in speeding and parking tickets, drunk drove several times a week. Then came the deep depression. I sat in my own filth for days and picked at my skin until my face bled. Couldn’t go to school or work. I then went into a mixed episode where I would scream at my loved ones saying things like “I CANT WAIT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF LATER” and “I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE” in what my family refers to as “the demon voice” where I kinda sound like the hulk. Ended up in the hospital. Now I’m back on a low dose of lamictal and am more stable and successful than ever. Please stay on your meds as hard as it is 🙏🏻"

BipolarReddit,fizdd5g,t3_fafytj,1582859991.0,"I hear you. It is very scary especially with the stigmas and knowing it can never really be cured, only treated. One thing that helped me when I was diagnosed and didn’t know how to cope was thinking about all the times before being diagnosed that I thought I was flawed and didn’t know what was “wrong” with me. I couldn’t figure myself out. Being diagnosed, although it was scary, it really helped me forgive myself for my erratic behaviors and my depressive episodes where I didn’t even want to be alive. It also helps me understand that going forward, when I have those same issues arise, I now have an explanation for it and I can be aware that I am not stable. It helps me catch myself a bit before things get too bad. Hang in there, it IS possible to enjoy life with bipolar, and be successful and feel fulfilled...we just have to work a little bit harder.
