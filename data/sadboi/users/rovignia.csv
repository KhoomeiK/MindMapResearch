socialanxiety,fqq603i,t1_fqpl8is,1589559987.0,That's what I like about the current situation. I can just join the Zoom meeting a minute before it starts and nobody even notices. No more wasting time.
mentalhealth,fo65o4t,t3_g5razb,1587547438.0,"I know that feeling. I was in a clinic for eating disorders a few years ago and I can wholeheartedly say that those 2 months are among the best of my life. There were no expectations, people actually cared and I didn't have to worry about life. In fact we had no connection to the outside for the first few weeks which was really nice. And it was so great to actually meet other people with similar experiences so we could all fight our demons together.

Sometimes I get this feeling that I really miss that time. At first I thought I missed my anorexia itself, which was pretty scary. But then I realized that I actually missed that clinic. I'm still sad that I had to leave as early as I did."
LaCasaDePapel,fo2v0kt,t1_fo0tbka,1587474760.0,"This is probably unpopular but I like the decision to kill Nairobi. The show got to a point where it would be unrealistic for everyone to still be alive. In my opinion it needed a death and it had to be a major one, otherwise people wouldn't care.
What I don't agree with is the way she died. Personally I would have preffered if she had died after being shot by the sniper. Mostly because there is no way the group should have been able to pull off that surgery."
fuseboxgames,fnz3qzd,t3_g4pva4,1587385221.0,That's a whole new level of commitment ðŸ˜‚
LaCasaDePapel,fnhg1cb,t1_fnh9hcj,1586961712.0,"I just skip forward a lot, that's the only thing that helps. I don't even know what's going on with her and Rio right now, because I don't like either of them."
mentalhealth,fmsksdy,t1_fmshpso,1586357406.0,"I know, but the fact that I don't have to deal with university right now still helps. I started working on various farms 5 years ago, but my mental health hasn't been this ""good"" in forever. As I said, I'm sure I'd hate my life if I didn't have my job right now and I can't imagine how hard going through this alone must be."
mentalhealth,fms6hid,t1_fms4wrw,1586348043.0,"That's great! It's so good to get a little break from being worried all the time. I get the phone stress, thankfully my friends really respect my wish to not be called without warning. I think I would just not pick up otherwise.
Hope you stay healthy and everything works out for you."
mentalhealth,fms60rc,t1_fms5bev,1586347652.0,"Yeah same. I've actually made some progress with my social anxiety but I feel like it's going to be worse again once everything goes back to somewhat normal. I can't really do anything about that right now though, so I try not to worry too much about it."
mentalhealth,fms0qd5,t3_fx2qdr,1586342543.0,"Mine has actually gotten better. I think that's mostly because I'm not expected to go out anymore, which is usually super stressful to me. I don't need to make up excuses or tell people I don't feel like going which would then lead to me fearing that they hate me now.  University is also much easier for me now, because I don't have to suffer through lectures.

That being said I still get to go to work, since I work on a farm, which is obviously considered relevant to the system. So I spend a lot of my time outside and working with animals which has always been good for my mental health. I'm sure if I was stuck inside an apartment I'd feel differently."
AnimalCrossing,fmp7qb7,t1_fmp3yf5,1586275992.0,Okay I'm not taking anyone new now. There are already way to many people waiting. If you have messaged me already I'll try to get to you.
AnimalCrossing,fmp3yf5,t3_f6u48g,1586273984.0,"Nook is buying turnips for 606 bells on my island right now so I'm opening it up for a bit.

I've learned from last time, so I'll only let a couple of people in at a time. Also my internet sucks so there's that.

If you want to leave a tip that would be great (looking for roses right now) but it's not necessary.

Also I'll be mostly afk, so please behave :)

Dm for Dodo"
TrueCrimeWatch,fmksj74,t1_fmjplc9,1586166957.0,"Already forgot about that again, so disgusting. To be honest I wasn't even really shocked by that with everything else that went on there."
AnimalCrossing,fmfs58p,t1_fmfr6fw,1586033711.0,Pretty sure you can only find that one fruit.
AnimalCrossing,fmbq3ip,t3_f6u48g,1585931139.0,Hey! I have Flick on my island so I'll open it up for a bit if anyone wants to sell something to him. Just please be careful around my few flowers. You can pick any of the fruits though. I'll mostly be semi-afk. Dm for Dodo.
socialanxiety,fm3gd6s,t1_fm389dj,1585722600.0,"Same, my professors really don't care if you participate, but they also don't care in normal lectures. So for me nothing changed, except that I get distracted all the time. I'm still anxious though, because I always have that irrational fear that the camera will just randomly turn on."
socialanxiety,fm3fcsh,t1_fm335dj,1585721630.0,"Whenever I notice that happening to somebody else I always listen to them until their story is done. I can see how this would happen in big groups, but if there are only a few people to begin with it's just rude."
