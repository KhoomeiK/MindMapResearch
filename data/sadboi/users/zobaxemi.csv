mildlyinfuriating,fqy4615,t1_fqxsqpb,1589742295.0,"Good article about pans, I have a few that warped inward do to extreme heat exchange. And if we were talking about a pan that would be a more likely hypothesis. 

Although I am not discounting this as a possibility on a pot, it is not as likely. One of my passions in life is cooking and as such I am assuming that this pot is mainly used for two reasons boiling or deep frying. So why does this make a difference? 

1. A Boiling pot stays at a very low temperature because of the liquid in it. 
2. If used as frying pot the oil also helps keep the temperature low. 
3. It is also less likely you would throw a pot of boiling water or frying oil directly into a cold water rinse as you would after frying some eggs on a pan. 
4. Lastly I would like to see if warping has occurred at the base where it’s most likely to occur and it would have to be quite significant to warp the walls like such."
mildlyinfuriating,fqxr6sx,t1_fqxmmmo,1589736595.0,"Aluminum is a very malleable metal, in other words it can easily be bent even without heat. Aluminum also has a very low melting point, 1220F. 

An Electric stove’s top Max temperature range between 400-600F, but I am guessing you don’t just leave the pot on high for prolonged periods of time. You cook food in it which lowers the temperature significantly because of the moisture in it. Even with cooking oil, you wouldn’t want it to be hotter than 375F for cooking. 

But to answer your question, yes high temperature can make aluminum easier to bend. But heat alone in the temperatures describe above is unlikely to cause it to warp as show in the picture, you would still need to hit it somewhat hard to cause the bent."
