Aaliyah had  the marriage revoked later on and denied any relationship with him afterwards. She died in 2001 though, so we'll never get her side of the story. They met when she was 14."

AustralianMakeup,exgni54,t3_csqm70,1566268801.0,"I checked the ingredients of your moisturiser and your cc cream and they shouldn't be interacting this way. I think the issue is that your skin looks very dry and a little cracked, so your cc cream isn't adhering properly. 

For now, try using the Wayne Goss method of applying liquid bases. Apply your moisturiser/sunscreen, then a layer of poweder on top, then your cc cream. In my experience, this allows my bb cream to adhere to my skin better than just having a moisturiser or sunscreen beneath it.

In the long term, I'd just focus on moisturising as part of a daily and nightly skin routine."
