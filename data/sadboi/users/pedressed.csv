AskReddit,f6166z8,t3_dq2m27,1572634032.0,"My parents don’t know that i still have a problem cutting myself. 

I started cutting myself in 7th grade (6 years ago.) When they found out back then they sent me to a shitty therapist and my dad was angry and my mom was in tears. After that was all over they think ive never done it again. 

In reality i just found a better place to hide the cuts. I was 13. Now im 19. I’ve tried to stop multiple times. But my depressive episodes just give me a really strong urge to do it, because i feel like im punishing myself for being such a pile of shit, for not being as successful as others, for being depressed in the first place. I feel relief in my head after i do it. But then i look down at my thighs and I feel so ashamed. 

I dont do it everyday. I stop for months by distracting myself with drawing, writing songs and short stories about my thoughts, and listening to depressing music. And then i feel that  strong urge again, and sometimes i cant resist it.

Sometimes i can resist the urge. I just grab my note book, or my notes on my phone and I write a story or song based on my thoughts. It helps a lot.

But, my boyfriend found out. He took my blades. And im glad he did. Because im 4 months clean and i’m going strong. I hope i can stay the rest of my life clean."

AskReddit,f54h9s0,t3_dmsyvv,1571982315.0,"October 26th, 2016. (My 16th birthday). The day before my birthday i had a party at a trampoline park which no one showed up to but my cousins, bc my “friends” all made excuses up at the last minute like they did every year. While i was at my party, i was on a trampoline and landed wrong and hurt my ankle really bad. I ended up walking on it again that night but the next morning when i woke up for school (the day of my b day), I tried to get out of bed and fell as soon as i tried to stand bc my ankle hurt so damn bad. so i limped my ass to my bus stop at 6:00 in the morning. My old high school has 12 buildings so i had to limp from the bus through 3 buildings to get to my first period. My 1st period teacher noticed i was limping and sent me home bc i could barley walk. When i got home i tried to play on my “new” 3ds xl. I played fire emblem awakening for 30 minutes and then i tried to exit out of the game. my 3ds froze and turned off. I tried ti turn it back on but it never turned on again bc my cat fried it by pissing on the damn thing."

1. one day i was taking an order at mcdonalds in the drive through. this lady ordered 20 cheese burgers and nothing else. when she pulled up to the second window she was dressed as ronald mcdonald and everyone went crazy and started taking selfies with her 

2. I was working in the drive through one night, cashing people out at the first window. this kid and his friend pulls up to the window and after he payed for his order he pulls out a deck of cards and asks me if i want to see a magic trick. i said sure because it was a slow night and i was bored. he did the “pick a card” trick on me. lol he did this 3 separate times as far as i know."
