Don’t worry about it!! It’s very nice to be aware where we can go wrong, that way we make conscious efforts in not allowing ourselves spiral down a familiar road. Rooting for you!"

BPDmemes,fqz17f7,t1_fqxrwef,1589758086.0,"Hi there.

I’m sorry my post triggered some hurt in you. I can understand how difficult this feels and that I’m honored to have been privy to this tenderness in you. That sounds really horrible. But thank you, for soldiering on.

The thing about FPs is that at its very core they are maladaptive coping mechanisms of codependency. And I’m not sure about other people, but I’ve found that  I never had control on who gets to be my favorite person. Sometimes, they could be really pretty shitty people. 

I think the hardest part of having an FP is acknowledging and accepting that people who know about our diagnoses don’t owe us anything — despite them knowing about our dark uglies, we aren’t entitled to feeling like they should put up with it. Even if we would do otherwise for other people. It would be nice, yes. But we don’t always have empathy and understanding from people. Let alone someone as abusive as yours. He doesn’t sound like a good person at all. 

Mental illness is tough to battle, but it helps when we are aware of the things we can't control vs. those we can. I hope that you find the strength to not take things personally when others treat you differently; I know it's hard, but we have to be aware if the situation arises from our own shortcomings or from things we can't control."

BPD,fp4b6j9,t3_gazy08,1588295361.0,"I started crying when as I was reading this, because I felt your pain so much. I know what it’s like to finally feel like someone you love finally reciprocates in the same magnitude only to be robbed off that idea to wake up it was only us putting them in a pedestal afterall. And you sit there thinking about all the meals you would have cooked for them, the matching rocking chairs you would have bought, holding hands in grocery stores and you begin to see it’s never going to happen.

OP, if it makes you feel any better I’m where you are. 
but here with me is a man I’ve never seen face to face... for !!!!!!!2 weeks!!!! we spoke on the phone for hours 
he gave me attention and I thought — this is love, he gets me, his flirts finds me out. He even made a playlist and when he deleted it, I tell you I was prepared to die. The funniest part is I still think he’s my soulmate I just don’t get to be with him. 

You know what they say, when you see life through rose colored lenses all the red flags are just white flags? It’s hard to accept how much we love someone isn’t as important as how they treat us. And if he can’t reciprocate the love you want to give—and I know, I know it’s so much love—keep it, don’t give more. He won’t understand how precious it is, at the very least he’ll acknowledge. :("

BPD,ffwgw66,t3_evjz3e,1580300585.0,"I always had Manic rage even as a child—crying in my own birthday parties and telling my friends to go home I don’t want them there. My dissociation started when I was about 7. I would stare at my mother long enough to question who she is, if she exists, If I exist. If I was dreaming.. I had intense fear of abandonment too, I would tie my foot next to my father to make sure he doesn’t leave me to go to work when I sleep. By 9 I had my first fp. And At 14 I had my first suicide attempt and struggled with several EDs. (My parents really loved me and did their best to raise me healthily)

But I wasn’t diagnosed until I was 18. I guess, it’s not something that’s boxed into a certain age. It’s a disorder that’s got to do with both nurture and nature. And regardless whether you think you have it or not, seeking therapy would help. And whether or not you do get the diagnosis, talking about your issues will help a lot and give you tools to cope with life better. Trust. Sending you love and light!"

BPD,ff8178j,t3_es1gug,1579663311.0,"I feel for you. Just this January alone, I’ve gone through several different selves - I went from becoming a tarot reader, a dungeon master, and an icecream maker, at one point I almost relapsed into proana but I’m glad I got into making icecream more. 

All of these I’ve done pretty excessively, I would lose sleep to achieve my full potential. Talked about whatever it was that I was into nonstop. Stalked subreddits. Spent A LOT for it. Then eventually, abandoned it for something else. And it goes on. 

I think it’s got a lot to do with our addictive personalities and our lack of self identity. We easily find obsessions and become it, thinking this is who we now are now and feeling safe. Our black and white thinking makes moderation very hard and very tiring. And I think it’s also being unused to feeling safe that makes us abandon something. Personally, I still struggle to recognize myself outside of my sadness."

MDMA,fdhrhwo,t3_eldekx,1578428751.0,"From October up until December I would binge on weekends everytime I’d have a scene. I just recently learned that BDSM in itself was neurological play and the way I treated MDMA was very much intact abusive. The last time I’d done it was mid December. I rolled 3 days back to back to back. It must’ve been over 5 grams in total. I’m tiny. Five foot tall. Barely 90lbs.

Prior to the mdma abuse I have already been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depersonalization/de realization syndrome. But the immediate crash to it was horrible. I was self harming like crazy. Outside world was horrible (it still is at this point.) I am having troubles with my memory in a real way, not the neglectful I just forgot way. It’s an I DONT REMEMBER way. Some days I’d forget if I had eaten at all. Some days I don’t remember where I am and how I got to bed. My day would sometimes restart with no recollection of yesterday. Everything is a blur. It’s painful.

On top of that, I am more depressed than I ever was —primarily because it’s frustrating to be reminded that I CANT REMEMBER MUCH ANYMORE. When I dissociate it becomes very dangerous, because apart from distorted reality I would go through phases of select amnesia.

I love this drug, I wish i knew better."
