SuicideWatch,eza5n41,t3_d096f1,1567795321.0,Didn't think I would either but two weeks I snapped and did it.  There is suicidal ideation and there is an attempt.  Your thinking narrows and you look for a way to end it... Now.  Keep access to heights weapons and deadly weapons away from yourself.
SuicideWatch,erz1lvs,t3_c4xc57,1561423274.0,"Hey another person most people don't want to be alive here.  That all sucks and I understand why you just want to stop. I do too much of the time.  Don't know what to say but that if you can accept yourself and find others that support you, it might not suck quite as much.  Your life is yours but people like you make the world a little bit better by being alive."
SuicideWatch,ervoixr,t1_erux88o,1561321105.0,"If I could fix myself, I definitely would have done so about fifteen years ago, or sometime between then and now. That's why I'm in treatment. Part of recovery is having a group of people who are supportive, and it can be frustrating to find the right people to talk to.

I for one would love to be able to go to a hospital if it would actually help, and I think most people here would too.  The problem is that for the most part hospitals suck, are understaffed, overcrowded, and don't lead to a cure.  Comments like ""You're asking for it"" show that you know that being put is a hospital is less about recovery and more about warehousing or even punishing the mentally ill."
SuicideWatch,ervoami,t1_ervnixc,1561320936.0,"Ah didn't mean to put words in your mouth. I can get really angry about it, so ha ha, that was projection.  The thing people don't really realize is that it isn't the possible tragedy of losing you that is the present predicament. The problem is that right NOW life is unbearable, and that's what most people don't pick up on."
SuicideWatch,ervmzht,t1_ervlw3s,1561319976.0,"In my experience people that don't get it never get it.  Some people haven't experienced suicidal despair or clinical depression, and can't stretch their imaginations that far. Try not to hate these people and reach out and find a group of people you can talk to about these things with."
twinflames,er87qgm,t1_er1m3s6,1560598281.0,Hi. 10+ year lesbian relationship.  I could not honestly work out who was the girl in our relationship.  A lot of gay people just do something different.
SuicideWatch,er5b0et,t3_c0jxmf,1560522166.0,"I have the same thing if I'm around groups of people, even my family for longer then a day.  Try to be accepting of yourself. When it comes to family it should be acceptable to quietly excuse yourself when you start feeling embarrassed."
SuicideWatch,er51t8t,t3_c0gxhv,1560515854.0,"Quick google search places the average American with $38,000 dollars in debt, excluding mortgages.  Credit card debt is common and a pain in the ass.  How long have you worked and is medicaid available in your state?  You can get therapy and a psyche on medicaid for no charge. I worked throughout my 20s and burned out completely in my early 30s.  I got a lawyer and went through the healthcare system. During the 2.5 years it took during my initial treatment I racked up $10,000 in debt from living expenses.  The lawyer I never paid anything out of pocket for, since he only was paid if I ended up disability.  I am now on disability.  The back owed disability paid the lawyer and was enough to neatly settle my debts.  

&#x200B;

If you're in a western culture small debts can be taken care of.  Even if you owe $1400 dollars you probably have a min. payment that is under fifty bucks.  If you need someone to talk feel free to throw a PM.  Take care of yourself!"
SuicideWatch,er3erx3,t3_c09z7e,1560461696.0,To give you a more serious reply I think all the time about how shitty the world is. I just don't really want to succeed in a world where success means stepping on other people. I don't even want to live in it. Leave it to the rats.
SuicideWatch,er3ek3m,t3_c0aboc,1560461564.0,"You could talk to him and see what he wants to talk about. If you aren't friends ""I'm gonna miss you"" would probably sound insincere.  I don't know the guy but I don't like it when people say that, it is like they are trying to guilt me into pretending to feel better."
SuicideWatch,er36kz8,t3_c0aboc,1560456914.0,"For me the sentiment that is effective is ""yeah man the world is shit, I'd miss you but I'm jealous of dead people myself"""
