Funny thing is I kinda forgot how expensive this game gets like Pot of Extravagance is around 90$.

Honestly, I should have noticed my screw up before it happened because I dont think the static ip of a router should be changed in this situation. I was setting up the PiHole according to the Linus Tech Tips forum tutorial. The stuff below is from Linus Tech Tip's forum tutorial on how to set it up. I messed up step 2.3. Mind explain why they did it the way they did? Can I just SSH into the Pi, set up the pihole and change the DNS to point to the Pi? My bad if I am misunderstanding something. Trying to learn this. Thanks.

 ***Now that we've found our Raspberry Pi's IP address + MAC Address, we need to assign it an INTERNAL/LOCAL static IP address.***

1. *This process is going to vary wildly based on which router/DHCP server you use, so we'd recommend Googling your router's model name/number (can be found on the back) + ""how to set static IP"" (ex: ""Netgear R7000 how to set static ip"").*
2. *If you're willing and somewhat tech savvy, you might also be able to figure it out on your own.*
   1. *Start by navigating to your router's admin page. The IP for this is typically located on a sticker on the back of your ISP's provided router (along with the admin page's default username and password), but you can also find it by running the command ""ipconfig"" in command prompt on a Windows PC. Your router's IP will be listed after ""default gateway"" (*[***https://i.imgur.com/S2Ndc0w.png***](https://i.imgur.com/S2Ndc0w.png)*)*
   2. *Log in to the admin page either with the Iogin credentials listed on the back of the router, or by googling the model number of the router along with ""default password"". Some routers use a randomly generated default password, so googling will not work for those.*
   3. *Once logged in, look for a tab labeled ""DHCP Reservation"", ""Static IP Assignment"", or something along those lines. (*[***https://i.imgur.com/FeMjd4V.png***](https://i.imgur.com/FeMjd4V.png)*) You may have to go to the Advanced menu to access this. (*[***https://i.imgur.com/6l4kIqH.png***](https://i.imgur.com/6l4kIqH.png)*)*
   4. *Enter the MAC address we grabbed earlier with Angry IP scanner, and then enter/select your desired static IP address (make sure you're using something not taken by another device on your network). (*[***https://i.imgur.com/znUTbKv.png***](https://i.imgur.com/znUTbKv.png)*)*
   5. *Hit Apply (or whatever the equivalent is for your router)* "

Problem is my family doesnt have a lot of money and will only let me go to a school that is pretigious enough. With the issues I have with family durinf highschool, i didnt do well enough to get into the colleges I want. I got into a cheap public school but I still live with my family. Because I dislike my family, I tried to transfer out after first semester with a high college gpa. It didnt work because I still had a bad highschool transcript and colleges still see it. Second semester was rough since I had some bad profs and a lot of family issues. I just finished my third semester but I had a head injury the day before finals week and i also had a big arguement with my family about something that would change my life the night before 2 of my biggest finals. Because of this, I was felt miserable and couldnt focus on the test. I fear my gpa wont be good enough for transferring to the schools I want and I dont know how to explain all this information in my application.
