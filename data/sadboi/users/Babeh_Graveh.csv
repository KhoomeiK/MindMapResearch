LDR,foilmlj,t3_g7n1dw,1587789805.0,"Time will eventually heal. If not today, then maybe tomorrow.    Not the most most empathetic thing to say I know, which is why I recommend watching this Ted talk called ""how to fix a broken heart - guy winch"". Its powerful and inspiring.

Remember to maintain yourself, get out of bed, shower daily, eat healthy, do your hair, wash your clothes, it's the little achievements that help build you back up. Keep doing your interests and hobbies, if they don't make you happy anymore, try new things and be adventurous. 

Good luck, I wish you the best."

HongKong,flnncir,t3_fg8kqd,1585322167.0,"Here's a rough translation as my Cantonese isn't the best but it gets the point across.

Lady stops 
Police1(holding the tape): go cross first

Samaritan: come on, come here first. I'll walk with you. I'll walk with you to cross.

Police2 on the left: are you feeling sick?

Lady: looking at you guys makes me feel sick 

*Too many people talking*

Samaritan2 comes in
Samaritan: we'll cross together

Police1: we're here to help you guys
Police start circling her and get close
Police2 touches her

Lady: get your hands off me

People in reflective coats come and help guide the lady
""Watch out watch out make way""

Most of them were also saying this Cantonese phrase that means like no fear, take your time no rush."
