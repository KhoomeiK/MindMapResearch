In the case of your situation: is there anyone you know who you'd feel comfortable with or able to move in with while you catch your feet? Being in an environment with your sperm-donor doesnt sound like a good place to be, for your health, considering he put you through such hardships.  

Also: your experience is valid! The fact that you went through all of that and havent yet given up hope and are reaching out is truly amazing, and im truly proud of you for it. You *are* able to stay strong, like you're currently doing. Reaching out is the best thing you can do.

The incidents suck, but they are handled in a case by case basis. I will say this, though, a quick cursory search says to me that Fox probably wasnt on hormone regulators, which could be and probably is a big factor. But she's also in a fighing sport, where people fight esch other. To injure them. Deliberately.  

But the main point, you missed. I dont think that you should be able to put on a dress and fight in womens sports or anything. I think that you should be able to spend spme amount of time transitioning, on hormones, until you're performatively female in terms of physicality (typically about a year or two). This is because hormone regulators cause ***palpable, demonstrable changes*** in body physicality. And after taking them for a long time, you objectively become not a man, and physically as functional as a woman. If you disagree with that, i dunno what else to tell ya.  

And in that case, I'd also retract my apology, TERF. :)"
MurderedByWords,flk7ka3,t1_fljwzdv,1585235538.0,"Brb, unloading some social science on you.  

>I don't think I do, no. XX or XY chromosomes are pretty much what defines a man or a woman.

Please note the ""typically"" in the first paragraph of your source. And that leads on to:  

>1: Swyer Syndrome.  

>2: Intersex people  

Firstly, use sources about intersex people published past 2002. Itll show updated definitions that actually include conditions considered as intersex.  
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex](find a table) that shows significantly higher percentages than that study, for the XX(m)/XXX/XXYY/XYY/Klinefelter(XXY) etc. results summed together make a lot more than 0.018%. But barring all of that, lets talk about why 1 in 80,000 people or 1 in 5,560 people, as your sources say, or even 1 single person, are actually a statistically relevant minority when we're talking about.  

Say you have a system that's designed to be all-inclusive. Something thats going to categorise every single person in the world into groups arbitrarily, with no exceptions. Assuming you want to do a good job of that and build a system that can successfully do that, you're going to want there to be no exceptions. Every exception is a person that can't be accounted for and is a failure. Let's call this system something like Gender-2. Let's say that you base it around hair colour. You order people into differences like brown hair, black hair and blonde hair. All of a sudden, 1.5% of the population are ginger and cant fit properly into the system. You're left with a large population that cant be included in society properly because youre not accounting for ginger hair.  

You might think that 1.5% is substantial enough, but this question is just Sorite's paradox all over again. Whats the cutoff point? 0.5%? 0.1%? 0.05%? Or is it juuuust enough to cut out trans and intersex people?  

That also avoids the question altogether. Isn't just one person not being integrated into this hypothetical society because it refuses to acknowledge their existence pretty immoral? Scale that up to about 60,000 and its not a great look.  

>Secondary sex characteristics, my comrade.

What are your chromosomes? Have you checked? Have you got it tested? If so, great. Have the billions of people who dont notice the difference? Can you feel the difference in chromosomes? Can you see my DNA? Or alternatively, are you just looking at my physicality, my shoulder width, my tits (or lack thereof), etc., and making a judgement on that?   

Thats enough biology and social science information though. I don't mind too much about that bit. But now we're on to the actual point of contention. 

>It's not exclusive to trans women, of course. There are natural variations in everyone.  

***This. This is my point. The fact that youre separating it to just taking it out on trans people is what I'm taking issue with, and shows pretty negatively on trans people in general.***  

>Most of these variations are eliminated naturally. A 150 lbs. American football linebacker (who has to physically block opposing team members) is going to get pounded into paste. A 300 lbs. running back (who often catches the ball and runs for the endzone to score a touchdown) will be easily caught.

But, surely, this is just as unfair against the 150lbs linebacker and 300lbs running back as trans women who happen to be good at running has? These trans women just have a natural advantage thatll naturally eliminate those who are slower than them. It's no different to QBs with broader shoulders, or running backs who have really thick muscle mass in their legs (more so than the average QBs or RBs).  

>Yes, but we're talking about biological men playing in women's sports. Those are restricted to biological women for good reason â€” as a general rule, biological women wouldn't be able to compete with biological men.

But these aren't biological men. These are trans women, who (ideally) have gone through the necessary hormonal treatment to the point where the athletic costs of HRT will, on average, either outweigh or cancel out the athletic benefits of being AMAB, with the added benefit of also being significantly happier. Where that point is exactly, I can't say for sure. Thats up for officials to decide.  

>As one example, a professional women's soccer team was beaten by a bunch of male teenagers. Professional women's sports teams often have practice matches against high school boys teams and the women often have trouble keeping up.

Oh god, that meme. I didnt think id ever have to see that again. I'm just gonna leave [this video](https://youtu.be/-9xmpikmsBI) here as he explains it better than I could.  

>You can look up literally any kind of physical competition that has both men and women in it and the men's achievements blow the women out of the water in probably 99% of cases. Men are just better-suited to athletics than women as a general rule.

***I agree with you there. The point of contention, I think, is whether trans women who have gone through an arbitrary amount of HRT are in the same league as cis women. I'm saying a) yes absolutely, and b) who cares, sport is inherently unfair.***  

Which brings me on to:  

>I would also argue that sport is not unfair by design. To the contrary â€” rule books are amended every year in an effort to make the competition as fair as possible within reasonable limits.

My point is that the very concept of sport (throwing a bunch of people together to do something until they figure out who can do it best) is pretty unfair because people with natural benefits can and will as a general rule outperform those who work just as hard but dont have those benefits. Like my example of height in basketball games, for example. It's just something that's going to be present in sports where biological advantages will be exploited by coaches and talent scouts. Some trans woman will inevitably experience some variations in terms of transitioning that probably won't kick in until a bit later, and as a result they might have a tiny bit more muscle mass and put up a 1600m result a half second faster than the record Thats stood for years, or something. Thats just how sporting events and the sporting industry go.  

Edit: forgot a couple things.

>And if that is the case i say go back to letting trans men into womens bathrooms.  

This was meant as an offhanded sarcastic comment. 

>I'd be fine with all bathrooms being gender-neutral across the board. Doesn't really matter to me.  
However, some people prefer gender-based privacy, so the best compromise would perhaps be to have men's, women's, and gender-neutral bathrooms.  

We stan an ally :)  

Also, im aware the first half might seem a bit harsh at first. I'm just trying to good-faith defend and justify my existence and i apologise if i seem a little dry as a result. Hope its alright"

I'd also like to see you campaign for people taller than 6'6"" being eradicated from basketball leagues as they have an inherent advantage over the normal person. Or maybe people under 5ft tall from taking part in gymnastics. Cis men and women with abnormally high bone density and testosterone levels who just have genetic differences. Sport as we know it is categorically unfair by design, and surely you can understand that an incessant focus on this difference in particular and none of the others could very easily be seen by an educated onlooker as a justification for shitting on trans people.

Taking T blockers and estrogen *fucking kills* muscle mass and even shrinks you by a few inches, so even the most dominant athletes are reduced to a mass of sludge for muscles in just a few months of transition. So for the most part, trans people after about a year or so of transitioning are at pretty much the same level as cis women, only with less muscle memory in terms of physicality. Sure, there will be outliers that will seem unfair if they do pursue athletics, but it wont be any more so than cis women. Most stories you see are just outlying cases that are exemplified and exaggerated."
