CoronavirusUK,fp07wmq,t1_fozght5,1588204144.0,Just wanted to say that your comment really amused me and made me smile üòÅ
iTutor,fontkcm,t1_fonnclj,1587926191.0,"Thank you for answering! Do you know anything about a ‚Äúcompletion bonus‚Äù or do u just get a bonus per class based on your ratings? 

And what do you get per 25 minute kids class?"
BPD,fokxoea,t1_fokwcyf,1587850918.0,"That‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôm feeling right now, like I don‚Äôt matter. You what crazy, I know if he contacted me and said something nice to me my mood would suddenly switch and I‚Äôd be happy again. I hate how much I depend on him to feel happy. But yeah, u don‚Äôt think he will contact me to be honest. So I guess I‚Äôm just stuck with the feeling of worthlessness."
lonely,fokxdr6,t1_foksl5u,1587850758.0,You sound like such a wonderful and lovely person!
BPD,fokuhbl,t3_g7zixa,1587849183.0,Thank you so much for saying that. As a person with BPD it‚Äôs good for me to hear something positive for once. Thank you for taking the time to write that out.
BPD,foku42s,t1_foklg4j,1587848981.0,I‚Äôm going to follow your advice too if you don‚Äôt mind because I‚Äôm currently going through an FP ignoring me and it‚Äôs hell. I‚Äôve never tried what you suggested before but I shall try it now and see if it helps me.
BPD,foktr32,t3_g80nw1,1587848784.0,"I know exactly how you feel. In the last couple of days my FP has ignored communication from me multiple times and I basically feel like he‚Äôs gone, like he‚Äôs abandoned me. The pain in indescribable, it hurts so much and I feel like me worth as a person is tied to him and by him doing that it has made me feel worthless."
CasualUK,fohe544,t1_focumvt,1587764431.0,Please do that would be wonderful!
OnlineESLTeaching,fo3mqdg,t3_g3gvtt,1587489488.0,It includes one downloadable resource at the cost of ¬£14. It sounds like a complete and utter rip off to me.
CoronavirusUK,fnmjlhb,t1_fnlyiqw,1587072600.0,Ok how on Earth you think anyone can give an exact date for when the lockdown during a viral wide world pandemic will end is beyond me! GET A GRIP.
CoronavirusUK,fnmiwei,t3_g2eks1,1587072237.0,"I remember reading this. I‚Äôm glad to know your doing well and have a new venture! That sounds wonderful, I‚Äôm very please for you."
CoronavirusUK,fnf8c4z,t1_fnf4p2q,1586903274.0,Ok thank you for explaining your experience. I had a different experience to you so I gather that supermarkets must do things different from location to location and branch to branch etc. Thanks for opening my eyes.
CoronavirusUK,fneogu1,t1_fneg0vc,1586893005.0,"You are 100% incorrect. I used to work at a major UK supermarket as a checkout girl and I solely worked on the checkout only. Under no circumstance did I stack the shelves because that was not my responsibility. The people who stacked the shelves just stacked the shelves. Actually, supermarkets DO generally have different people sticking to different parts of the job."
OnlineESLTeaching,fna9fky,t1_fn603a3,1586793488.0,Err what?
CoronavirusUK,fmllaxa,t1_fmlkgl8,1586188629.0,"I think it‚Äôs better to face reality and facts even if it‚Äôs not something we want to hear rather than live in cloud cuckoo land and pretend everything is full of sunshine and roses. We aren‚Äôt children anymore. You don‚Äôt need to be shielded from the big, bad world."
CoronavirusUK,flscm5x,t1_flqkfpj,1585439154.0,This is incredible! I love this!
Coronavirus,flrwt73,t1_flqv5gv,1585429524.0,"I am from the UK and I we ARE on a lockdown. We have been informed to stay at home and self isolate and to leave the house only if it is completely necessary, for example to get food from the supermarket. Even then we should do it infrequently. They have shut down restaurants, pubs, cinemas, gyms etc. We are not permitted to go outside in more than groups of 2 and even then it must be from the same household. We are not permitted to travel unless absolutely necessity and then there are police checkpoints which stop and ask you were you are going if you are in a car. I could go on and on........

So in your world, how is this possibly not a lockdown?

Like what has to happen for it to be classed as a ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù? A government official welding you into your house so you physically can‚Äôt leave through the doors and windows? Police to be outside, and if you take a step out you are presented with a ¬£10,000 fine and a 5 year prison sentence? For all the supermarkets to shut so you are not even able to enter these premises anymore and have to survive on what food you already have in the house. 

You might thing I‚Äôm being ridiculous. But I‚Äôm not, you are."
dogpictures,flrv6r2,t3_fqrq44,1585428544.0,Happy birthday Elsa! Wow this is absolutely lovey! It‚Äôs so heartwarming to see the effort you put in to celebrate your dog‚Äôs birthday. This post has actually made my day!! Thank you so much for posting this!
insanepeoplefacebook,fljkyr2,t1_fljg01z,1585217076.0,Have you never heard of the Spanish flu or the bubonic plague? A pandemic of this level HAS happened before on numerous occasions throughout history.
BPD,fljgnyw,t1_fljgjuu,1585211746.0,Thank you! I‚Äôll take a look at it.
BPD,fljggie,t1_fljffqs,1585211492.0,"If you somehow remember, things usually pop into my head at unexpected times haha, please could you let us know? It‚Äôs seems like something I‚Äôd love to watch."
BPD,flijvn5,t1_fliiyq9,1585184095.0,Well your ‚Äúrandom opinion‚Äù means a lot to me and it helped me very much so I‚Äôd like to express thanks to you.
BPD,flihqq1,t1_fligvwk,1585182780.0,"I‚Äôve actually never thought about it in that way before so thank u for giving me this aspect to think about. On that note, maybe if I try and practice more self care and make a real attempt to have more positive thoughts maybe this could work to change things. I don‚Äôt like having all this hate for some people, it‚Äôs exhausting and it doesn‚Äôt feel good."
FoodPorn,flh32zc,t3_fotax3,1585155178.0,Looks heavenly!
BPD,fl2cyef,t1_fl2ccif,1584748168.0,Haha yeah that can happen sometimes!! I know that well
BPD,fl2bkdy,t1_fl289zk,1584747266.0,Why are you on this subreddit if you don‚Äôt have BPD? Does someone close to you have it?
lawofattraction,fkcsauz,t3_fc7qxn,1584060013.0,Thank you universe! I claim it üôåüèª
BPD,fjykwv1,t3_ffh74t,1583698957.0,I don‚Äôt have a tips but I wanna tell you that you are not alone. I‚Äôm currently in bed now too unable to move or leave it. I feel intensely sad and also have zero motivation to do anything. You aren‚Äôt alone because there‚Äôs someone here feeling and doing the exact same thing as you right now.
BPD,fjvgzjx,t1_fjqzd1e,1583627075.0,That‚Äôs the thing. I DON‚ÄôT deal with it. I just suffer.
BPD,fjqwo2d,t3_fetdyd,1583578752.0,I fee like I could have written this myself. This speaks to me. They feel like my own words.
offmychest,fitpveh,t3_f9rn4v,1582726649.0,You are sick and disgusting. You are a waste of space and air. You don‚Äôt deserve to live on this planet another day. How could you have  hurt an innocent creature like that? You are a monster and you are inhuman.  Depression isn‚Äôt an excuse to harm and inflict pain on a helpless animal. The world really would be better off within you in it.
offmychest,fitpgwb,t3_f9rn4v,1582726374.0,You are a disgusting and horrible person. The sooner you die the better. You are truly a monster. You deserve pain and suffering. The world would be better off without you in it.

iTutor,fgk34ts,t1_fgjtcix,1580856497.0,"Thanks for your detailed response! It‚Äôs good to know what others experiences are. You‚Äôve been helpful, thank you! And yeah I‚Äôm registered to teach OUP classes and I have an average rating of 9.5 currently."
iTutor,fgjkb3u,t1_fgis75t,1580845805.0,I‚Äôm from the UK too. So which hours do you teach UK time? And how many 25 minute classes to you tend do to per day? You‚Äôre so lucky to be fully booked with 25 classes! I wish that was the case with me.
BPDlovedones,ffu0uu9,t3_euxz62,1580232067.0,Even though it‚Äôs stressful I think the intensions here are good are admirable. It‚Äôs a kind and lovely thing to try and rescue strays.
relationship_advice,ffiol8h,t1_ffhpz27,1579978854.0,"Of course. No problem, everyone is entitled to their opinion."
relationship_advice,ffhpt75,t1_ffhletd,1579947456.0,Your opinion sucks.
OnlineESLTeaching,fffpwe7,t3_et975w,1579889228.0,"You‚Äôre complaining about people not being able to tell the difference between certain words. And judging by the responses, you made the exact same error you were complaining about in your post! Thank goodness for the editing function that you seem to have utilised eh? All you have achieved in your post is making yourself seem like a fool. What a joke. I‚Äôm laughing at you right now."
relationships,f4vb9mw,t3_dlxgal,1571839690.0,"I actually have a great solution for you. Clip in hair extensions! I‚Äôve been wearing them for years and they are easy to put on and look very very natural! And your hair can be as long as you want it to be. If you want you can PM me and I‚Äôll give you more advice about this. Don‚Äôt worry, your problem is easily solvable."
relationship_advice,f3oh9y2,t1_f3o5lou,1571017892.0,Agreed. Would you did was highly appropriate which is great on your part! I think it was just definitely  the phrasing that seems a bit odd or unnatural. So maybe night time phrase it in a different way.
relationship_advice,f3oc8as,t1_f3nn3yy,1571014015.0,I second this!
relationship_advice,f22augt,t3_dbfbc4,1569885556.0,Do not get rid of your cat. You definitely should not have to do this over a girl. Your gf is being unreasonable when she expects you to do this. You should put your foot down in this situation.
relationships,f20axh8,t3_db3uyr,1569857489.0,Tell her. She has a right to know how awful her bf is. Find her on social media and go ahead with telling her. It‚Äôs the right thing to do.
relationships,f20944u,t1_f2045g8,1569856818.0,"Every time you write something, the more I feel like your personally sucks. You have so many awful personality traits."
relationships,f208coh,t3_dbc8eq,1569856546.0,"I feel like you are childish and have low emotional intelligence. You clearly don‚Äôt respect other people‚Äôs time. Your boyfriend certainly does not owe you an apology. You are in the wrong not him. How on earth do you expect him to feel if you keep cancelling plans with him again  and again and again? And not only that, when you do turn up you seem to have a problem with punctuality too. This shows a high level of disrespect on your part. If your boyfriend is so amazing as you are describing, then you certainly don‚Äôt deserve him. You need to stop being so selfish and realise that other people‚Äôs time is valuable. He has every right to feel frustrated and annoyed with you. If you like actually like him then you have a very weird way of showing it because your behaviour shows that you don‚Äôt care about him. Even if he broke up with you over this issue, I think he would be perfectly right in doing so.  It is ridiculous that you even think he owes you an apology. I think it should be the other way round, hun."
