personalfinance,ffufxcq,t3_ev6rv7,1580241124.0,"I’m 22. I graduated college (and was a full time student until) May 2019. My mom wants to claim me as a dependent this year so she can get the credit, but I didn’t live with her at all and made over $4k because I got a job right after graduation. Can she still claim me because of my student status? It’s my first time filing taxes so thanks in advance!"
