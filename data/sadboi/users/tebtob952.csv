ChronicPain,fqv4fop,t3_gkylve,1589669669.0,"Ugh yes, I agree with everyone on here. I was gaslit into thinking I was a hypochondriac nearly
my entire childhood and even early into adulthood (also grew up in a very abusive household) until I couldn’t keep trucking anymore and was diagnosed with h/EDS, Stage 4 endometriosis that was unresponsive to surgery, severe interstitial cystitis and a couple of other ailments. I absolutely encourage you to seek diagnoses, as by the time I did, I had sustained permanent damage. 
The real kicker? My “mother” refuses to believe I’m actually unwell- refuses to go to any Drs appts, go to surgeries, look at my records/imaging. Nada. I’ve had to remove myself from her life, as well as my “dad” (divorced) who initially took me to the appts and surgery and knows all about this but has serious mental health issues that are untreated and manifest in violence and aggression. I am just saying this in hopes that anyone else suffering similarly can relate and reach out and hopefully maybe a situation like this could be prevented in cases of not having healthy/balanced family."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqk6yrh,t1_fqhjmm2,1589421340.0,Yeah I am really seeing Cheyenne’s spoiledness seep our more and more and wish she weren’t a part of it. She is so so far from being a teen mom. I think she was nearly 25 when she had Ryder and literally just seems like her world with everyone else living in it. This is not the life of any other teen mom in the franchise even. You watch them have to figure things out on their own and make decisions and hold down the household but I really only ever see her super codependent on her family and other people and not sure if she can just chill alone without constant attention. It kind of worries me that that’s what Ryder is experiencing as well. She comes off as someone who has never had much real life experience whatsoever and can’t relate. We’ve never seen her worry about how she’s going to make life work even before a teen mom. Everything has been super cushy for her regardless of finances and she knows her family will take care of her emotionally and financially if she ever needed and yeah it just boggles my mind that she’s on a show called teen mom about struggles of teen mothers or very young mothers and this is far from the case here

Snooki could do anything and never worry, as mommy and daddy would tell her it was all alright, be yourself, you’re fine, the world is wrong and go ahead!

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpaizix,t1_fowhhzn,1588449156.0,"It was cringey and so self righteous for her little bit of air time. Wow seems she didn’t have to fight through incredible family trauma to finally gain to confidence that she can perform after severe severe early child hood trauma that was prolonged, postpartum depression, being on national tv for all of this and just wow. She didn’t really even give Cate a moment to weigh in. It was a monologue and an ego boost. The smallest of things are incredibly hard when you are perpetually made to believe you are inherently defective and can’t do shit, it takes a toll on the psyche and can relate to her lack of confidence after years and years of a similar childhood. Looking back and being 4 years older than Cate, it all seems so easy, but when you’re first emerging from trauma, even those first few years, after your whole entire mf life being a terror zone and feeling as though you’re at war, can be so foreign and difficult to adapt to, as everything is full of doubt. Without a very strong support system, and even with one, it is inevitable that one will be severely stunted, despite Cate putting a painstaking amount of energy and effort into her personal well being and growth/evolution. Wonder if that tech would like to trade and battle to overcome insidious trauma as a full time job or choose vet tech school 😅😅. Gross bc she’s probably well aware of how hard Cate has struggled and how deprived from resources and discouraged/brainwashed from using resources at an early age. I’m sure that which we haven’t seen is beyond appalling and would really rattle even the *strongest* of personalities commenting on here 😬💛💛"

Not defending her, but that ain’t oxy lmao. I’ve unfortunately closely known two people with bipolar disorder; it looks just like this.

At least before, there weren’t more children involved and Ryan didn’t have such contempt for his parents with someone egging him on. This is just sick and Mackenzie knew exactly what she was doing.

Likeee, even when he was starting to look rough, he was with stunning women who didn’t take shitttttt from him. They were also slim and fit, similar to Maci. Can’t imagine he laid his eyes on Mack and thought of anything other than a person to right his wrongs, do his dirty work, do damage control and be the only one who “gets him”  and have a home to live in away from his parents since he’s a felon and can’t have his name on shit etc. Yeah, Mack you’re his damn savior, g! 😅😭

He looks so far from sober I cannot BELIEVE he is appearing on air for this and is lacking this much awareness about his appearance. Mack seems so used to him like this, as this is how she met him. Guess it’s hard to call out of your attic has been when you met him like that and only see that as his baseline. She has zero idea who the real Ryan is, and I’m sure he hardly does anymore either. Maci may remember what she initially saw and maybe his parents, but Mack is signing his death certificate with her negative, bratty behavior.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpadi09,t1_fowjok4,1588445902.0,"Right? But thinking in Ryan’s head, at least he could blame it allll on Maci, since we all know he doesn’t give a shit about anything other than image and control when it comes to Bentley. Must be inconvenient to have to blame both your mom and dad annnnnd Maci.. must make you not look so great, must be kinda frustrating, cue Ryan having a fit- pretty much sums up years of this. God I have such conflicted feeling about Mackenzie, knowing that she’s a survivor of domestic abuse but her entire time with Ryan has been full of enabling, delusions, excuses, resentments, loss of dignity.. it’s disturbing and sad & pretty sure even Jen has never been a huge fan, even though they also enable. It’s hard to respect someone who either lacks so much basic emotion awareness and is so insecure that they will deluded themselves to the degree Mack does and shit, if I didn’t know better, I’d be convinced that Mack was also an addict or in recovery with her petulant bs."
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpacmho,t1_foy3rz2,1588445383.0,Absolutely agree. Thank god; some objectivity and empathy for Cate on here!
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpacg4l,t1_fowjvjy,1588445277.0,"Tyler also has mommy. Cate really has never had the security of have a home base or a safe place before life with Tyler. So much on here from people who clearly don’t know shut about  childhood trauma. Yeah guys, she doesn’t continue to talk about it endlessly, bc she’s grown and-coming from someone who has been through hell and back due to early childhood trauma as well. Everyone just wants her to do it all, while having loved her life on tv and having abusive people( mostly family) still in her and Tyler’s life. Working through trauma of that degree itself is a full time job; I’d like to see anyone choose to endure what she did- ( not having a choice in any of it growing up) & spend years trying to work their way out of it while in the public, while still trying to adjust to a toxic parent becoming sober, along with her FIL playing a similar role as her “mother” instead of having a “normal” life and working an average 9-5 job full time job. Don’t think anyone would choose her situation and pretty sure we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg regarding how she grew up. She chose to bury the burden, as those in trauma work say. It’s unbelievably painful and grueling and takes a ton of commitment, as it is a prolonged endeavor to work that shit out especially with postpartum, but yeah, guys, why can’t everyone just likee, hop outtta trauma and tell themselves they can achieve everything and like totally override their trauma? It’s not that hard, I guess they must want to be depressed or insert any other serious and prolonged mental health issue. 🙄🙄😬. A lot of super privileged and fortunate people here, just hope everyone is careful for their lot in life 🤷🏻‍♀️. Btw, this wasn’t realllly directed at you, OP, just sooo many comments about her season after season and I was down for it at first, but just can’t. It’s ridiculous and simply revealing how sheltered and aloof a lot of the audience is, or maybe just ignorant and/or jealous. Who knows. Lol I’m done"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fpaanq1,t1_fown5k5,1588444227.0,"Not a fan of the elitist grasping at straws for laughs on here. Oh, and this coming from someone who has been through prep school, college etc. Also, never struggled with weight, so it ain’t that either - it’s feeling her trauma and how incredibly visceral and insidious it has been to work through, and I mean far before Carly; I also grew up in an abusive household with a domineering and incredibly abusive mother. We’ve only seen what they showed on camera and everybody knows the M TV covers for abusers. I’m sure this girl went through beyond what most people on here could even fathom as ‘hell’. My “mom“ was and is very much like April and seriously stunted me for a long long time with me truly believing I was inherently defective and unable to truly feel much or know who I am, ground myself, set up for life etc. It was unfathomable to me and I had gone to prep school. Early childhood trauma is a motherfucker to come back from, it molds you. You feel like you aren’t capable or competent of shit, that you are smaller than shit on someone’s shoe, not to mention, don’t think “book learning” was big in their home growing up. My feelings and unspoken mannerisms at times have mirrored Catelynn’s so so closely. I’m also about 4 yrs older and was at a similar mental space at that age. Just be fortunate you’ve not had to endure what she has and keep it moving. These kids won’t ever have to feel as though they’re in a war zone, like my brother and myself and she is absolutely doing that which is incredibly difficult and mentally conflicting  my at times- breaking and burying the burden after looking and assessing everything head on. It’s blatantly clear the girl has done a hell of a lot of work. Tyler, April, and I guess her friends and I dunno, not really anyone who else have been who she has. Bah I’m done, hope someone takes this to heart. She and Ty ( despite their definite issues), do what most couples cannot: communicate in healthy ways, stay mindful as they can be, objective and take the time to process difficult situations and emotions. Lot easier to turn a blind eye thru all of this and just go through life on auto pilot."

But dear god, the amount of ignorance and watching people comment who have clearly never endured the trauma that Cate have and are fortune for it, but it’s unbelievably tone deaf and just unpleasant, to be generous. Take any positive moment, and bam, let’s make fun of Cate and how delusional she is to be happy about x y & z orrrr let’s fail on her for not being happy. Absolutely agree with what you said and sorry for the novel, but thank youuu. Cate’s truly trying to learn to how to live as an adult, wiout having had parents and is being transparent in front of cameras as we watch her make efforts and then the comments I endlessly see on here? I don’t know, I have a pretty twisted and curls up sense of humor, but it’s just not funny/isn’t landing when people go for Cate. Ty, yes, but good lordddd leave Catelynn aloneee 😂😂😭"

Cate is just not the person to come for; the girl has endured unreal trauma and is still clearly doing a lot so that people like many on Reddit won’t give her an even harder time, god forbid she is doing her best and has a huge heart. Girl has damn done a ton of internal personal work, coming from also me, someone who has been through an incredible amount of family trauma, worth a mother similar to April. I didn’t have the added feature of giving a child up for adoption or postpartum depression. Just kinda ridiculous for her to get so much hate and negativity while she’s just living her life up in Michigan with Tyler and her kids and animals 🤷🏽‍♀️. Meanwhile, people picking her to death. You do know, she’s learned to, hopefully, mostly laugh at all of this. I understand genuine concern, but I don’t see how any of this would help me, or even reach me in the depths of my trauma. Walk a mile in her shoes that she didn’t ask for from birth. Lol ok I’m done. I love laughing at shit posts on here but had to say that Cate doesn’t belong in them; it’s not funny bc they’re mostly non applicable, as I think about how much trauma has impacted her life and how much Reddit seems clueless and aloof and so privileged to have not gone through such hell, and a childhood like that is indeed absolute hell.

She seems as though she’s been desensitized to her trauma and it is sad to me. She doesn’t seem like an evil person at all. Didn’t like her for the first few years, but been rooting for her since getting away from Matt Baier"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp9woiv,t1_foyklnt,1588436118.0,"Oh and doesn’t anyone else feel that Jen & probably Larry too absolutely see the dynamics within Ryan & Mack’s relationship? It’s like Jen really can’t respect Mack at this point. Yes; they’re all enabling Ryan, but for fucks sake, the energy coming from Mack is so sick. She will enable Ryan til his death or god forbid something happens to the kids. Hellll no should Bentley be allowed over, and I wish that weren’t the case. I’ve rooted for Ryan since early on but nooo. This ain’t it"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp9wc6k,t1_foyklnt,1588435916.0,"Mack needs to stop getting any accolades or pity. She has non stop enabled this man since she dug her heels in on having him. She won’t leave no matter what and decided that long before getting super involved. Lol she knew upon meeting him, she’d never let it go. He’s symbolic to her, as he wasssss hot back in the day, and some weird bad boy, I guess you could say with her thinking she could fix him or that she would be the answer. Ahmmm, has anyone else seen what the other women he was with or whom he has chased have looked like? She was insecure enough for him to know she wouldn’t leave and the fact that she doesn’t see that is depressing. She will do anything to have Ryan talk to her and not be mad at her. If I don’t know better, I would think she was struggling with drug issues as well, not wanting to partake in activities with the children. Seemed like a petulant kid herself"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp9vqwn,t1_fozki3c,1588435565.0,"Similar situation and found out at 19, 12 years ago that she had cancer early and we didn’t know what to do. I was heartbroken but she made it through and have yet to develop a relationship. Her victimhood and nastiness has gotten worse in ways with her projecting all her emotions, zero regulation and blame on everyone but her, endless negativity and attempt to control. But no, no human deserves it. I’m sorry for your loss; I have no idea how I’d be had we lost her. The chance of it coming back is extremely low, as she doesn’t have the genes and wasn’t aggressive cancer, but more attributed to her constant stress/anger/lack of sleep and co abusive relationship with my “dad”"

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp9vaj6,t1_foz1tjx,1588435293.0,"Anyone ever realize she’s changing meds constantly and drs very rarely rx meds that can be abused anymore, especially to an ex addict, which her drs are aware of. I work in mental health and this is simply the serene, pink cloud many with bipolar and borderline have in their mania with new experiences and being sexually or romantically impulsive and desperate while on new meds. To a T, yet the ignorance in here is through the roof with people saying she’s high.. I very much so doubt it. Don’t think Gary would agree to sit there and would call it out, as would others. Notice you don’t see any family? She has a whacked out mom, dead father who was never much of a father, and a weird relationship with her brother who is always traveling for military and actually now wondering where tf he’s been this season lol"
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp9usg9,t1_fp0ly61,1588434994.0,"It’s kinda gross how many people on here get off on Cate’s struggle. I agree that she is ignorant to so much of how things work and how far behind she is, but you try fighting similar trauma struggles. Not to mention, she is reliving the trauma over and over and was working on fixing herself until now and still is! Yeah, maybe you could say she should’ve waited to have kids if so, but Tyler’s held it down, and bah, just sick of people living for Cate’s sorrow, Jesus Christ y’all"

Dude has gotten away with shot that would never fly in the home of other recovering addicts’ family and found a women whole he knows will never leave. He couldn’t be less interested in Mack; let’s be real. It’s just someone who will listen to him bitch and whine and tell him yes yes, you are right 😑. Pretty sad. I gave her the benefit of the doubt earlier on and assumed it was mostly due to her young age, but believe she is at least 25 now and that’s just ridiculous. The way he acts around her is abusive and no one even being that up"
