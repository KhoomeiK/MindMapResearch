That’s so kind of you to say. We talked and it went better than I thought it would and tbh your comment really helped me stay calm. Thank you so much for your help"

depression,fmerlm4,t1_fmazg9c,1586011933.0,That sounds weirdly mysterious. Have u got any idea what it could be that she maybe will tell you?
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,fmcdx71,t3_fucccf,1585943807.0,I absolutely fail to realize this is the same person

depression,fm81u0m,t1_fm3xk07,1585841194.0,Maybe it’d help if u gave it a go again
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,fm57i3a,t3_ft1227,1585767748.0,This one wins
depression,fm3qnwx,t1_flyilrj,1585733358.0,"Thats sounds fucking shitty and I am so sorry for what you have to endure honestly. That girl you talk about sounds like a horrible bitch and what she’s doing to you is really unfair. 

Are you in therapy or on meds or smt like that?"
depression,flxwx5j,t1_fltsj7p,1585591375.0,Idk sometimes it just feels nice to get it all out. I’m here if u need to rant
depression,fltrfmc,t1_fltoqcq,1585484744.0,Do you want to talk about it?
depression,fltnncr,t3_fqka9s,1585480612.0,That’s really fucking relatable. I even sometimes find myself wishing my parents wouldn’t love me so that suicide would be easier.
depression,fltncya,t3_fqncd4,1585480270.0,"When I am in a really bad place I imagine my suicide in vivid details and plan everything out even though I don’t really intent on doing it. And it is weirdly calming. Idk why though, but it doesn’t feel healthy"
depression,fltna1f,t3_fqncid,1585480174.0,I’m in exactly the same situation. I am literally procrastinating right now and it’s ridiculous because I keep telling myself I will do it later or tomorrow even though I know I’m probably not going to have the energy to even look at the tasks given.
MadeMeSmile,fljsd9k,t1_fljs6m5,1585225089.0,It’s an age old joke with a dude named Dave whose wife uploaded him snoring to Spotify. She even released an instrumental version when it blew up.
depression,fl705j4,t3_fn130u,1584889897.0,I kind of feel similar I guess. Message me if you‘d like in case you want to talk about it or simply need to rant.
TooAfraidToAsk,fl4cfaw,t1_fl1w753,1584810588.0,Then a low self esteem is probably indeed what’s keeping you. Maybe therapy could help there. Good luck dude
TooAfraidToAsk,fl1vw4g,t3_flv42e,1584737398.0,"Everyone is saying it’s a self esteem issue and it does sound like that. But maybe if you’re sure that’s really not it, have you considered not being into girls? As a lesbian I have experienced „liking“ guys but as soon as there was chance of them liking me back I lost interest. 
I’m not saying that’s it. I think it’s more likely that you simply need to work on your feeling of self worth. But that’s something you could consider maybe too."

SuicideWatch,fk4j9gp,t3_fggh2p,1583861546.0,Im so so sorry for what you had to live through and that shit thing your mom said is simply horrible. I’d say stay strong but I know that that doesn’t really help. I wish I could hug you. Good luck for getting better.
depression,fk4gpxo,t3_fdgxip,1583860113.0,"Same. „I want to die“ just pops up in my head almost randomly all the time. I even started saying it out loud as a kind of joke I guess? Does anyone else do that? Like, when I am talking to someone about something „bad“ that will soon happen, like an upcoming test, I will just say that or „I wanna kill myself“ or stuff like that and then laugh like it’s funny."
depression,fcjyn7x,t1_fc93c27,1577710723.0,Yeah that’s a nice metaphor and all but how do I make my depression pay rent exactly? I have no idea what to do. Right now all I do is trying to get through my day and that is fucking exhausting on its own.
depression,fc92v68,t1_fc8so8l,1577546139.0,"I tried to take pride in my sexuality and it made everything worse. Now I’m just even more terrified of finding out that I was faking all along and have to come out again eventually. Also, my friends all were very supportive but now all of them except the ones that are gay themselves are constantly annoyed by me hinting my sexuality because I ‚rub it in‘ and stuff Idk. I wish I hadn’t come out."

depression,fal3wau,t1_fakhcf2,1576177964.0,Hey could you tell me the name of that song? It kinda sounds familiar but I can’t think of the title. Thanks
depression,fajo2dg,t3_e9krol,1576147798.0,Hey I’m in a kinda similar situation. I’m 15F and my depression has been going on since I’m maybe 13? Idk. It seems so hopeless. I know it’d probably help to talk to someone but I’m so goddamn scared of telling my friends or parents or anyone really. Idk why. If you wanna talk feel free to text me though.
AskReddit,fajnlt1,t3_e8brj7,1576147120.0,"Well I’m actually having a quite good relationship to them, especially my mom. I came out a few weeks ago and they took it rly well for example. But Idk she’s a psychiatrist so she’s dealing with people that are in a way worse state than me. Also, a few years ago I tried cutting for the first time and she saw and freaked out. I’ve never seen her as mad and panicked and scared and I really don’t want to do that to her. 
Idk"

Sleep is the best part of my day rn"
depression,fab9e83,t3_e8dtkt,1575919758.0,"I‘m sorry. Sadly, I have no idea how to get rid of this. 
I kinda feel the same. 
I used to have hobbies. I used to read books, so many, more than 5 a week, I used to watch movies and cried when they had a sad ending, I used to draw and meet friends and read articles about topics I was interested in and do sport and I was passionate about all that stuff. I talked about it to others and I enjoyed it. I used to have character traits.  I used be quiet and shy but kind and funny if you got to know me.  Now it just feels like depression has erased my whole character. 
I just feel  empty all the time. I don’t enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. I still do most of them, but only because I feel like I should. Otherwise I don’t do much. I listen to sad music and write in my diary. Lately I have been going for walks outside, sometimes for hours. I don’t know if it helps, because at least I do something but I’m maybe even more miserable when doing so. 
But at least I feel sad then. Any other time I just don’t feel at all."
depression,fab71os,t3_e8di85,1575918729.0,I think I just fell in love with that song. Thanks man
depression,fab4n45,t3_e8b3ox,1575917689.0,"Literally no one tells me that and I still feel that way. Not just about my depression, which is completely stupid by the way since I have told no one about it, I also feel like I am faking being gay for attention, as well as having social anxiety and basically any other problem I have and if I try to be rational I do realize how stupid that is but I just can’t stop overthinking everything and in the end the result of my overthinking is always that In just lazy and need an excuse to be sad and egoistic."
