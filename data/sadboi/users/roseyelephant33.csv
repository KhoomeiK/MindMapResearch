""Dear children, let us not love with words or speech, but with actions and TRUTH"" (1 John 3:18), ""Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil"" (1 Timothy 2:23-24).

Yes, Christians have done horrible things in the name of Christ. We are not permitted to determine their salvation, but that is not a godly lifestyle nor following God. & if anyone is of God their actions will reflect it.

I do not want to debate, as there would be no patience and love in that. But I would like to tell you that Jesus wants a relationship with everyone and He will fill any voids in your life.

But, yes, people with BPD can get very attached and distressed if someone isn‚Äôt paying attention to them as they‚Äôd like. I think you should continue the relationship and see how it goes, as well as researching DBT and the techniques used to combat BPD behavior and BPD as well to see how she thinks.

Currently at community college and have switched back and forth five times! Here is my advice: since your interest will switch throughout your life, I suggest not picking a degree that is SPECIFIC. Ex., nursing, counseling, teaching...of course having a degree in those fields doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt work anywhere else, but they‚Äôre most
useful if you want a job in those areas. I would pick a flexible and broad area which you can apply to many jobs. I‚Äôm doing mass communications, for example. There‚Äôs also science degrees if you enjoy that, journalism, digital media, public relations, sociology....etc. You can get experience by volunteering and just making connections while in school, too. 
I majored in recreational therapy while at a four-year and I had to do a lot of fieldwork hours for my major and had no extra time for clubs or volunteering unless it was shadowing a rec therapist. I could use that degree to go into OT or PT, but still, Id rather have a degree which I can use for many things throughout my life since i will likely switch jobs a lot. 

Just my opinion and ofc isn‚Äôt the only way to go!"
