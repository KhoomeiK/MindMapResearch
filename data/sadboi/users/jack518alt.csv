Perhaps that's true and I'm projecting my own (fragile) heterosexuality unto him.

Let me ask you something: should I watch porn right now?

The promise online communities like r/nofap make is that by quitting porn your drive will increase: both your sex drive for real women and your drive towards achieving your goals in general. It made sense and was very appealing to me, because I think I was unconsciously trying to cut out the digital devouring female and get in touch with my inner erotic feminine more fully.

But when browsing those subreddits, I came across guys who claimed they started watching gay porn and developed  Homosexual Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It is well known that when you watch a lot of porn, you become desensitized to it, not only making real life interactions boring and dull, but you also need more and more shocking and intense videos... and what's more shocking to a straight dude than gay porn?

They reported the same type of cognitive dissonance as OP did, and by quitting porn they managed to regain their true sexuality back. So I saw what OP wrote and my first thought was that it's the same issue... or is it not that simple? I cannot avoid feeling that if his first experience with homosexuality was through porn, and he hasn't stopped ever since, he should at least try to see what happens if he goes a few months without it. Like, at this point I'm just repeating myself... so why do *I* feel like quitting porn, at least for a while, will help him bring his Anima/soul/true sexuality under the light? Am I just projecting here?

Fair enough. I'm not a professional, but neither is 99% of this subreddit's users, including yourself, so what are we doing here? 

I just gave this man advice on the basis of:

* **My personal beliefs:** High speed internet porn rewires the brain. I'm not talking about playboy magazines here! Have you heard about sissy hypno? Read about it, but for your sake, don't watch any videos. He started watching porn from a very young age and never stopped. It's my personal belief that stopping will help him better understand himself sexually, without the external influence of pornography. He must unplug the virtual anima, return to his body, and dance with his own natural anima. Regardless of whether it will help him or not, I really cannot see how it can cause him any more harm than, say, trying to cut out junk food to see if you feel better. If not, it's still going to be there. The clarity is worth the sacrifice of momentary pleasure.
* **Experiences:** I recently became aware that I used porn to dull myself from my own feelings of shame. Believe me, I know how caustic it can be. But he has to face it head on. In my opinion, quitting porn will be a great practical start for his shadow work journey. It will be difficult and will enhance his emotions, including his painful ones, but that's what it's all about.

So the advice I gave him is just what I would do if I were him, or the advice I would give a friend, simply because it's what I believe will help him the most. And it's literally the only advice given to him, beside the perspective and book recommended to him by the first comment I replied to.

Jung,fqei7vo,t1_fqdmg8z,1589307978.0,"What I disagree with: We live in our natural environment. I won't go into the semantics of ""natural"" but I think most humans are far from it.

What I agree with: We aren't wolves, and most dudes who worry about being alpha are insecure.

But notice what you said:

>The least alpha thing ever is worrying about being alpha

You inadvertently characterized something as ""alpha,"" admitting there is an ""alpha male"" archetype, regardless of the name given by the Internet subculture.

[We are basically having this same debate.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4yz-P94n0Q) What Joe argues is that the archetypal alpha male exists and is assertive, confident, ""hunter"", powerful, driven, high testosterone, and everything under this light of **natural**, healthy male sexuality.

From a Jungian perspective, I believe this men are so because, ironically, they have danced with their anima. They are more at peace with their minds (less neurotic) and with their bodies (their movements are more fluid, they have ""swagger"")

[This video](https://youtu.be/pVYCYhQxXfA) and [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/gfvzyf/egirls_as_sexual_personae_a_jungian_look_at/fpxeta2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) explore the neurotic misogyny that occurs when men, instead of fighting their demons to rescue their soul, decide to go even deeper into the virtual world and over-intellectualize being ""alpha"" by removing any feminine aspect from it and unbalancing their masculinity to the extreme, to the point they stop being empathetic towards women ([r/trp](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill)) or even interested in them at all ([r/MGTOW](https://www.reddit.com/r/mgtow))

That's why the origin of the term ""alpha male"" is relevant: the image of an ""alpha"" wolf or lion has this aura of all the traits I mentioned above, but again, in this **natural** drive. I think it's so appealing because ""betas"" are out of touch with their inner natural driving forces (anima, soul, instincts, impulses) due to a lot of neurosis (overthinking and anxiety) and a rejection of their bodies and nature.

As you mentioned in another comment, lions eat their rival's offspring. They also sleep 18 hours a day. Not very ""alpha"", is it? But what you are not realizing is that these are modern facts we have learnt about them very recently. The aura these animals give off have more to do with our ancient subconscious image we have of them. We feared and respected their ferocity since they were our natural predators.

I wonder if the men who had similar ""alpha"" traits where better at protecting their communities from these beats/monsters, and at the same time, emulate them to be better hunters and provide more... at this point I'm rambling and not helping my case, but it's a good example of the rationalization to justify being more ""alpha"""

His sorry blind ass can't even tell what the fuck is happening cause he can't see shit anymore. The guards don't do shit, why would they?

And the girl? Yes, he is permanently scarred. But... she thanks you. He was barely getting started when you got in the way. It could have been a lot worse, and she would have never recovered had he got away. But no, you saved her. You could have only done so by being alive, and being you.

\---

That was dark, wasn't it? Yes, the world is a dark place, and I have these dark fantasies to combat it. Because you have the same values as me, you want the world to be cleansed of these motherfuckers. You have a sword, and a shield. The sword is your light, to actively make the world a better place by helping others. That's pretty simple. But then there's the shield... it's made of the same darkness you are combating, because you need to carry that darkness with you to protect the light.

YOU ARE POWERFUL, both in a light and dark way, but only if you stay alive and live based on your values. Dead... well, then you are truly powerless homie. Stay safe bro."

Jung,fpxeta2,t3_gfvzyf,1588981302.0,"This particular video of yours really spoke to me and enlightened me.

Is it not truly ironic how in the Matrix the red pill unplugs you from the virtual world, yet the original ""red pill"" only dragged men further away from mother earth and deeper into the virtual neurotic mess?

I believe that's why so many pills constantly pop-up (real or memes), because men keep looking for the one to unplug them and finally be at peace from their painful destructive thoughts... but from the beginning they took the true blue pill: living life and gaining ""wisdom"" virtually, not from direct experience.

In some ways, unplugging can feel like blinding yourself since there's *so* much information that promises to apply universally and be gained with no trial and error. It reminds me of the third Matrix movie when Neo literally goes blind... but then he can ""see"" by using his inner senses.

What you say about the body language, that speaks volumes to me, too. I think that bioenergetic exercises ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD-3j2g9w9U),[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9NhtLS1owM),[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pafdo1Pln5I),[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=225tAQzCVhs)) are a great way to bring our awareness back to our body and instincts and away from our neurotic heads.

But... what's the way out? How can one unplug and use the Internet like a tool? How can I help men like these? Yes, a tool like the Internet can provide valuable information, but it gets to the point where it overrides your own conscious analysis and conclusions."

""Suck. My. Dick.""

Of course they are a minority and honestly it doesn't matter, only what you think of yourself, so if you want to lose weight, go ahead, because you can lose weight. It's physically possible for everyone, no matter their metabolism, genetics or medications. What differs from person to person is how hungry they get and how much they suffer.

Honestly, ""starve"" yourself, but in a healthy way. Prolonged fasting does work, but the first couple of days can be very painful, but it gets easier.

 [https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=safe+prolonged+fasting+how+to](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=safe+prolonged+fasting+how+to) 

Regardless, as I said before, you can lose weight, be it through diets, fasting, surgery, etc. But you need to get in the right mindset first. You are doing this for yourself, not to be accepted by anyone, and the result doesn't matter: any improvement is a win. By losing weight you are becoming more healthy, and becoming more healthy you are becoming MORE POWERFUL"
