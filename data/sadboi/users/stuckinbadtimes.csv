benzodiazepines,euzgs60,t3_chytsl,1564119348.0,Yeah I was it I’m new to the market and don’t wanna get pressies less the have more alprazolam in them then 2mg and good rrviews/ trusted
benzodiazepines,eus7dp7,t1_eurpvtg,1564004236.0,Yeah dm me
benzodiazepines,eur7ll9,t1_eur52zq,1563990564.0,Yeah they may all have the same amount of alprazolam in them but there are different fillers in different brands. And for some people those fillers effect how quick or how the person in general gets affect by the alprazolam.
benzodiazepines,eup5qtl,t1_eup332h,1563951935.0,Cvs kinda ass I’m trying to figure out when to get my pcripts transferred to get some hips again
benzodiazepines,euoqfur,t1_euomou3,1563945418.0,And yeah they do dissolve and hit a little faster but sublingual route for me is nice.
benzodiazepines,euoq9yf,t1_euomou3,1563945358.0,"I also just take them sublingually instead of dissolving them and take one normally, and I get a nice relaxing night and just get to air cause I got rem problems with sleeping and wake up with sweats 3 or 4 times a night. But I know it takes like shit but brushing my teeth and mouth-washing get that taste out nic."
benzodiazepines,euomv1u,t3_ch3ga8,1563943949.0,"Yeah that’s why I like them, but school busses where the forst ones I got and they got me trashed but that was months ago when I didn’t have prescription."
benzodiazepines,euomiz3,t1_euombt3,1563943793.0,I slightly agree I fuck I with hulks for some reason and school busses but that was a while ago I have a bit of a tolerance now.
benzodiazepines,euom6ba,t1_euokzh0,1563943662.0,"Nothing but facts your speaking, lol"
benzodiazepines,eu2lbbr,t1_eu2k4iy,1563392656.0,Well it says it can slow your hurt rate down to dangerous levels but I’ll probably just use the beta blocker for my weekly stuff and sleep and then pop a few bars on the weekend I don’t wanna build a tolerance to Xanax because I used to go threw 30 bars a night.  Also I believe beta blockers are great for social anxiety like public speaking and stuff.
benzodiazepines,eu2jtic,t1_eu2e5ms,1563391719.0,"2mg clonazepam, but I just got back from the doctors and I got a 60 count of bars and a beta blocker, I’m dumb hype"
mentalhealth,esa1l5h,t3_c6niou,1561749426.0,Hell yeah congrats
mentalhealth,es4uaxt,t1_es4bz3v,1561594096.0,"Yeah I have ocd/add- adhd. I have a bad habit of needing my room and wash to be perfect and but definitely see a specialist, go threw you healthcare and find a specific specialist for you"
mentalhealth,es3ub7m,t1_es3oae0,1561570789.0,"Really that’s really surprising, primary docs usually don’t usually mind doing psychiatric practices for non habit forming meds. But do you have any other mental health issues other than insomnia?"
insomnia,es1qu05,t3_c57v1t,1561503393.0,"I think hydroxyzine 50mg would be your best bet for you but see if they have breakable tablets, and start with (25mg/half a tab), because the half life on them is 14 hours and personally to me any ways you don’t build a tolerance to the sedative properties as fast as trazodone where the half life is 8 hours and after the first few nights for me at least it didn’t make me tired or fall a sleep.... (if they don’t have breakable tables ask for a 60 count of 25mg) and you’ll sleep like a baby. First time I took 20 mg I sleep for 16 hours. But also it’s up to you doctor but you can suggest and see what they say... also I was the first one to comment, I made a new account I didn’t like my user name, but the first comment that has deleted where their reddit username is is me:)"
mentalhealth,es1n2qy,t3_c5dwge,1561500704.0,"I was the same way in certain ways, like in the way you want help but you just can’t let yourself do it, also it seems like you have separation and social anxiety and that not something you wanna live with forever. But definitely go see a psychiatrist or a primary doctor and they will push you in the right direction and tell them everything, and I mean everything so they can try to help you the best and most efficient way possibly and take your mother with you if you have to but if you have something your hiding from her like the comfort from another male just ask her to step out the room for a second and she be right back in and the doctor will keep it confidential. But definitely go see your primary care or a specialist. I would really recommended it it help me in marvelous ways that I thought where never gonna end.... hope this help you or motivates you to get help."
