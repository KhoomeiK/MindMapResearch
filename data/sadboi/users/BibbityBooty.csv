Bossfight,fr10626,t1_fr0r7gn,1589810629.0,"[Here’s a pretty good explanation ](https://www.ignboards.com/threads/a-pretty-good-explanation-of-the-ending-of-akira.453231713/) but for a quick tl;dr here’s my summary.

Amoeba can’t do much except eat things. Humans can build and invent and discover, which is more than an amoeba. A question asked in the film is ""What if an amoeba was suddenly given the powers of a human?"" I.e. “What if something small and simple had a much greater capacity for doing things (which they simply call “energy”)?

This is basically a way of saying that through some kind of human experimentation, Akira reached the highest state of being. He has become pure energy, probably in both a literal sense and in the sense of the idea I previously mentioned.


And, in case this part was confusing as well, the guy went blobs did that because his psychic powers and his body messed up and started replicating like crazy, to the point where it may have destroyed the world. 
(From the link) “Akira then uses his powers to bring Tetsuo and the others to where he is; thus turning him into some other form of energy. Although Tetsuo is gone, he isn't dead, and Kiyoko and the other's last lines explain, ""And one day we might be able to-"", which I personally think means that one day they might be able to bring back Akira and Tetsuo, OR all humanity might be able to become like them (sentinent, omnipotent energy beings).”"

Pewdiepie mainly (excluding the rather high-brow philosophy videos and book reviews) caters to his young audience, with repetitive jokes and emphasising the ingroup.

Hamon: - Infuses attacks and defence with holy magic sun energy
- kinda super strength/agility/speed
- slowed aging

(Part 7 spoilers)

...

...

Spin: - can contort skin, to the point where it can become bullet proof
 - can contract/extend muscles
 - can do additional damage with it
 - can somewhat control the direction of projectiles

Sure, it’s odd, but seems logically consistent I guess

 - can generate xrays/sonar but not as well as when there’s the eye in the ball?
 - can bend limbs (including bone) so that it’s basically flat?
 - can make boobs and butts perkier for about a week?
 - is better when on a horse that is running (or kicking) because reasons?
 - can produce or is related to gravity in some fashion?
 - can trump certain stands and pierce through dimensional barriers?
 - can improve/evolve stands (sometimes)?
 - can be used to wring water out of someone’s body? 
 - can modify the density of air to reflect light in such a way as to create lenses?

When it comes to magical forces in stories, I like to be able to at least think “Okay, I see how you could apply X in that way”. 

What it comes down to is this: Hamon has a foundation that makes sense (it’s a breathing technique) and then have the applications of that be somewhat logically consistent (it’s good for health/it’s important for being alive -> it works well against undead (I.e. not alive) and makes you more physically capable)

I love part 7, and I’m totally fine with a non-stand thing being stronger than Hamon, but there’s valid reason for thinking Hamon is “better” by whatever metric we’re going by"
