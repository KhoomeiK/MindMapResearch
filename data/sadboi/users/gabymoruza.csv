Anxiety,forgu3s,t3_g95yhc,1588011997.0,"I‚Äôve had these squeezing, hot, pressure tension headaches before. Mine were because of anxiety I‚Äôm sure. Anxiety creates strange physical symptoms that sometimes one can‚Äôt even explain! Just letting you know that you‚Äôre not alone and to get yourself checked out if it‚Äôll make you feel at peace."
mentalillness,fohddae,t3_g7ftee,1587764073.0,Don‚Äôt do this. You have too much ahead of you. People LOVE you. I‚Äôm sure you feel terrible but you CAN help yourself! Please call the Suicide hotline if you want to talk to somebody. I call them just for emotional distress.

Anxiety,fnudj77,t3_g3yxzq,1587259706.0,Why is our brain like this?! I am usually like this too (my anxiety always wants to check in on me). And it‚Äôs like self sabotage. It‚Äôs a process for sure. I hope you feel better soon. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long it takes. I hope you take it day by day and take in the good things. Best of luck!
Anxiety,fnt3pfu,t3_g3s1un,1587234018.0,I‚Äôm on the same boat! Having strange beats and impending doom. I had some crazy heart racing yesterday out of nowhere! Affecting work as well. I‚Äôll let you now tips when I get through this. I think we‚Äôre in flight or fight mode and anxiety. I wish you the best of luck!
Anxiety,fnqke2c,t3_g3d321,1587166363.0,You are not alone! I am irrationally afraid of dying on a daily basis too. Especially with all these weird heart sensations I‚Äôve been feeling. Sounds like panic disorder. You‚Äôll get through this and I wish you the best of luck!
Anxiety,fneq0zw,t3_g17nei,1586893803.0,I think anxiety is a shape shifter and can come up in many different forms. I‚Äôm staring to think that all these physical sensations (ones we‚Äôve felt before and new ones) are due to anxiety. The key is to ignore it (especially after getting checked out and given the ‚Äúok‚Äù) but it‚Äôs SO hard! I really hope you feel better soon. Please take care! : )
Anxiety,fnbzikz,t1_fnbhvbm,1586825465.0,Thank you so much. Everything you said is true and You are so comforting. Yes we‚Äôve lived this long with anxiety and we can do it. We learn and fight though it. I hope to be on your level soon. Take care of yourself!

Anxiety,fn8aflg,t3_g07hw9,1586737322.0,"Same, you‚Äôre not alone. One week is was covid, another was hot flashes and now it‚Äôs heart palpitations. Damn anxiety sneaks it‚Äôs way in all the time. Hope you feel better."
Anxiety,fn7ejih,t3_g01c0t,1586718758.0,I‚Äôm so sorry for what you‚Äôve gone through. I have major cardio phobia as well and it has put me through some real lows this whole quarantine. I get ALOT of palpitations. I‚Äôm always focusing on my heart. I feel like it is going to end up getting weak because of all my adrenaline rushes during panic attacks and that I will develop heart failure and slowly die. I think of TOO many scenarios in my head and every little thing I feel puts me in panic and dread mode. I am wearing a holter monitor for a week prescribed by my doc and I hope the results are okay. I have a heart condition so I hope my heart is okay and that it‚Äôs all anxiety. I hope you get better slowly. Day by day. It‚Äôs hard for others to understand. You‚Äôre not selfish; you are strong and you will get through this. Please take it one day at a time!
PanicAttack,fn6128l,t3_fzte4l,1586683269.0,"Yes. All the time, you are not alone. Either my heart races or I feel palpitations and feel that dread as I‚Äôm falling asleep. Hang in there!"
Depersonalization,fn19yza,t3_fyoo9n,1586557740.0,I remember it as a child as being in a constant dream-like state. I‚Äôd tell my parents ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm dreaming‚Äù and ask them if they know what I‚Äôm talking about.  They‚Äôd look at me with compassion but puzzlement. No one could ever answer my question or explain it to me. I think I was disassociating due my panic attacks I‚Äôd have as a child. Feeling like I was going to die due to a racing heart. I‚Äôm not sure if it was my anxiety or MVP condition that woke me up. But yeah that‚Äôs my input.
mentalillness,fn19kap,t3_fyphdg,1586557509.0,I‚Äôm glad your psychosis is over. Its good you accept that there are limitations but that you‚Äôre still willing to work with it and around it. I hope you feel better day by day. No matter how long it takes!
Anxiety,fmpp6vt,t1_fmnqtne,1586284838.0,"That makes total sense. It‚Äôs hard to find that balance but I hope you realize your health is much more important. But I get it, you gotta work to pay the bills. You don‚Äôt use alarms?"
Anxiety,fmpp1d5,t1_fmnchnk,1586284761.0,"Wow you‚Äôre strong then, crazy dreams like that are strange and I don‚Äôt know about you but don‚Äôt they leave a lingering eerie feeling? Well I‚Äôm glad you push through it to get some rest."
Anxiety,fmpowk4,t1_fmn8nvf,1586284693.0,"Ugh, why does anxiety have to spread elsewhere? That happens to me too. Sometimes it‚Äôs my nail biting, sometimes my eating habits, sometimes palpitations, sometimes hot flashes...etc. I felt a possible low point yesterday but I am doing much better today thank God. It just makes me realize that I can surpass a hard time and learn from it. I‚Äôm sorry about your low times and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve gotten pass them. Please take care!"
Anxiety,fmpols7,t1_fmnrlo1,1586284544.0,That‚Äôs actually the most common advice that makes the most sense. My husband and I do this and it really helps.
Anxiety,fmpohy1,t1_fmn0sfz,1586284492.0,"Hmm maybe it‚Äôs a mix of social and general anxiety? I hate that impending doom feeling. It makes no sense and it kills the groove, huh?"
Anxiety,fmpofae,t1_fmol2ay,1586284454.0,"Well-said. Just got some good sleep last night (thank God) so now it is time to learn and become stronger. Yeah, we got this. And I hope you slowly improve and grapple this anxiety."
Anxiety,fmpo7l8,t1_fmmkspq,1586284342.0,"Yeah and your heart because the only source of noice and feeling in your body, huh? Nice, I do YouTube funny videos on my better days, too. I hope you‚Äôve been doing alright üôÇ"
Anxiety,fmpo3d0,t1_fmnkcsa,1586284280.0,"Well you know what I‚Äôm glad you got all those things done. That is good proof that it‚Äôs all in your mind. And you know what, I can relate to the feeling of wanting another test just to make sure. I have this heart condition called Mitral Valve Prolapse and I got diagnosed a few years back. The doc took it lightly and just told me he‚Äôs give me meds if I had more palpitations. Well I did my own research and have found a few negative things about this contusion so I want to get checked up on it.  Gonna get a heart monitor mailed in soon to be recording. Also hearing the doc not to worry about my palpitations is reassuring but at the same time I don‚Äôt trust him or myself. It‚Äôs weird. But we gotta relax and trust the damn process!"
Anxiety,fmnmwis,t1_fmnl162,1586229852.0,Thank you for all your advice!

Anxiety,fmn73vs,t1_fmmsxlk,1586219596.0,Aww! I hope you feel better. The palpitations are totally anxiety related. Yes they can feel so damn weird that it can leave you spooked for hours üòØ
Anxiety,fmn6zp6,t1_fmmulbj,1586219524.0,Amazing. More and more people keep on saying this. I am going to try and control my breathing tonight for sure. And start beginner meditation. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôve put a handle on it!

Anxiety,fmkua01,t1_fmkslov,1586168921.0,Thank you so so much for your response! I really appreciate you taking the time to describe your situation. Everything you said makes sense. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had to deal with them on and off but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve identified that it‚Äôs common with your anxiety. I‚Äôm more than sure mine are because of anxiety too but yeah it gets hard not to get carried away thinking and feeling.
insomnia,fmkr44n,t3_fvvnrg,1586165344.0,Omg that happened to me a couple of days ago! It‚Äôs pure anxiety I‚Äôm sure!
insomnia,fmha5s3,t3_fv9sgm,1586072046.0,"I‚Äôm on the same boat. I rest a little then wake up super panicked and can‚Äôt get myself to go back to sleep. I tried natural supplements with relaxing herbs. Also we need a lot of patience and we need to take this one day at a time and we‚Äôll slightly improve each day. Tea, exercise, meditation, music...you know, all that jazz. I hope you feel better soon!"

Anxiety,fmek589,t3_futis4,1586006441.0,"Aww. I feel you! I‚Äôm on that same journey. So much dread and panic while falling asleep or falling into sleep. I‚Äôm afraid to fall asleep! I‚Äôm worried but we‚Äôre all experiencing this because of something that is actually threatening (this virus). I can see a road ahead of me now too. It won‚Äôt be easy but I see a lot of people are on the same road and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll all eventually triumph. A road in regards to insomnia and trying to get our sleep back in order, that is!"
Anxiety,fmejv6g,t3_fut7f5,1586006203.0,"OMG yes! I‚Äôm 27 too and also experiencing this hot sensation in my body! Ive felt it in my ears, face, forehead, neck and shoulders. It‚Äôs new to me so I‚Äôve been feeling fearful about it. But I called a doc and he says it‚Äôs extreme flight-or-flight. I have that hot sensation wake me up at night (also with palpitations) and it‚Äôs been so hard to sleep. This is happening to me this instance. I can‚Äôt go back to sleep because I burn up with dread and panic!"

insomnia,fmaxbpo,t1_fmawp7o,1585911487.0,I know it sounds clich√© to say but I hope we come out of this with a big lesson and more tools for our toolkit. This WILL pass eventually and we just gotta hold on to hope and try every day. Gotta give diffident techniques a chance each day.
insomnia,fmawcfj,t1_fmavs91,1585910407.0,"It‚Äôs okay, these things happen. Especially during this pandemic more than ever. Well my coping mechanism is taking deep breaths and focusing on that and relaxing. then I have watching a movie. I also have sitting in a cool area on the floor and doing this (reading reddit posts). also trying to fall asleep in a different place. 

Yeah my eyes are super sleepy but I‚Äôm too restless. Do you feel restless?"
insomnia,fmavnh0,t3_fu5ulg,1585909624.0,"Hello! You are NOT alone. I am having difficulty too. I fall asleep but it‚Äôs been restless because I jolt awake, panicked with palpitations. I don‚Äôt understand since I though my mind was calm. Right now I keep on waking up with an intense hot feeling in my head and then I freak out for no reason when I wake up. Repeat cycle. I‚Äôm used to the racing heart/palpitations but this hot sensation is weirding me out."
Anxiety,fm8mvqm,t1_fm7sktn,1585852262.0,So you‚Äôre on anxiety meds now not heart meds?
Anxiety,fm8mrsi,t1_fm7k445,1585852205.0,Omg Haha we got a similar genetics cocktail xD I hope you‚Äôre doing okay with everything that‚Äôs going on!
Anxiety,fm7gyxo,t1_fm7acvc,1585826642.0,You know what that sounds pretty whimsical and cool but I‚Äôd be afraid to have an OBE lol. But I‚Äôm all seriousness it sounds like you have your anxiety under control and that‚Äôs great. Thank you for sharing!
Anxiety,fm78pb3,t1_fm7846x,1585817369.0,I think our body gets weak from anxiety and all the chemicals that our brain has released causes heaviness.

Anxiety,fm6txhf,t3_ftfylq,1585803140.0,I know how you feel. I feel the same with impending doom and 24/7 anxiety and constant panic attacks. I know it‚Äôs hard to become at ease and to follow other people‚Äôs advice and just everything is easier said than done. A few things I‚Äôd recommend is music in the background and watching a funny movie. I hope you feel better. Good luck!
Anxiety,fm564n7,t1_fm4n6mb,1585767028.0,"Oh wow it is good to see I‚Äôm not alone. I mean of course I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling it too. It feels weird huh? and yeah they‚Äôre pretty much brought up by anxiety. It‚Äôs just annoying because when I feel something different due to anxiety I freak out and think it‚Äôs a bad illness or something. I hope you feel better and experience them less. We‚Äôll get through this, it‚Äôs just the pandemic causing us extreme anxiety."
Anxiety,fm3qsh2,t3_fswied,1585733488.0,It happens. I‚Äôve been sleeping at 6am due to all the anxiety I can‚Äôt control too. Are you anxious about the epidemic?
Anxiety,fm3pqnx,t3_fsw722,1585732368.0,I am so sorry you‚Äôre going through this and I wish you a speedy recovery. I did not not that sinus problems were part of the symptoms? So you guys can‚Äôt get tested? And your fear is totally rational.
PanicAttack,fm3pi0s,t1_fm33wsr,1585732111.0,I see. So you‚Äôre worried about you might have that hereditarily condition and also about catching coronavirus. Yeah it sucks when you‚Äôve been on a streak of everything being okay but then panic attacks return. It‚Äôs going to be okay. It‚Äôs all due to the excessive worry we‚Äôre feeling for the virus! Stay strong üòÉ
PanicAttack,fm338k9,t3_fsrhk7,1585711739.0,"Hiya, I‚Äôm going through heavy anxiety and frequent panic attacks lately too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the corona virus just making us feel so bad. What do you feel?"
Anxiety,fm0glk2,t3_fsbsjs,1585657135.0,Oh yeah! I get really bad knee joint pain for some reason.
Anxiety,fm03t9u,t1_fm03f7h,1585643594.0,I see. So when you get very anxious the hot flashes start. And sometimes the hot flashes get so intense they become nauseating. Thank you for elaborating. I am trying to make sense of my hot flashes as well. I think they‚Äôre happening because of immense stress and anxiety. Please take care. I think this is all because of our anxiety towards this pandemic.
Anxiety,fm03609,t3_fs91ai,1585642869.0,Hello good evening. I‚Äôm too much paying extra attention to my physical symptoms due to anxiety as well. I‚Äôve been having hot flashes on and off since yesterday and I am worried. I have no fever or cough either but I am concerned about the hot flashes since I‚Äôve never really felt them before. Could you share more about the hot flashes?
Anxiety,fm02ugc,t3_fs8jeh,1585642514.0,"Omg I can relate with the physical symptoms! It‚Äôs always something new I experience with anxiety. I freak out because I haven‚Äôt felt it before but then after a while, I realize it‚Äôs normal (I guess) due to panic/anxiety so I accept it. For me it‚Äôs been this hot flash feeling I can‚Äôt shake off since yesterday. I‚Äôve looked it up and feel some kind of reassurance but then I spiral back into doubt and worry. But yes when i experience some new physical sensation due to anxiety and panic that I haven‚Äôt felt before...oh boy, it gets really tough. I hope you feel better and keep on working through it. And I hope you remember that we‚Äôre feeling this anxiety harder due to the current world situation. üëçüèº"
Anxiety,fm02jf3,t3_fs8xl7,1585642178.0,"Hi there, I woke up feeling off in the opposite way. Feeling hot (but no temp). I think it has to do with our anxiety towards this whole pandemic."
Anxietyhelp,flzxk5i,t3_fre0bz,1585636895.0,Yes it can trigger underlying anxiety. And enhances physical symptoms like palpitations. I feel like decaf actually makes a difference.
panicdisorder,flzwbqi,t3_frgzw4,1585635664.0,I‚Äôm glad to hear your recovery time is getting shorter. You are improving and learning how to handle it better. There is hope and you are learning how to handle it.
Anxietyhelp,flzw4gb,t1_flz30hq,1585635467.0,"I see. Yeah major dental work can be nerve wracking. I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your MVP flaring up.

Anxiety,flzvwi0,t3_fs7659,1585635252.0,"Same, been having panic attacks so often and I‚Äôm feeling weird side effects because of it. Try and sleep whenever you can to clear your brain static. Even if it‚Äôs during the day. You got this. Good luck!"
Anxiety,flzvk0n,t3_fs72mo,1585634931.0,You are not alone. It effing sucks but sometimes we cannot control our anxiety but rather let it pass and learn that it‚Äôs all part of it. I know the mental breakdowns and messed up sleep schedules take a toll but it‚Äôs all due to this pandemic that is causing a collective anxiety attack. You got this. Stay strong!
Anxietyhelp,flyx5w2,t1_flyv443,1585610916.0,Oh wow really? I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not alone and I know how you feel waking up with a racing heart. It sucks but it‚Äôs happened so much to me that I just kinda wait for it to be over. Interesting about the hot flashes for you. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because of this pandemic. Our collective anxieties are all going through the roof. Thank you so much for your reply!

I keep on binging on the media despite knowing it does no good. Been having trouble sleeping and been freaking out on a daily basis. It desert help that we must stay home and that the media is 80% negative, 20% positive...but we will get through this.

I always go to Google to inform myself of EVERY little thing I feel ""off"" or ""different""...it's hard to share this with people because you feel they think you're nuts and annoying. This Virus news is NOT helping either. It is very crippling (panic attacks) and I sympathize with the mental toll you're feeling. I feel trapped and suffocated and have been waking up totally panicked and it takes me a few hours to finally relax. You can get through this, this is a novel kind of thing we're dealing with and i'm sure some of your anxiety will calm when all this is over. Please believe in yourself and keep it up."
Anxiety,flwhv1f,t3_frhufp,1585551222.0,"Hi there! Yeah same here, i get TOO much physical feelings...oof. Im not really aware or thinking and then BAM i get physical symptoms.
