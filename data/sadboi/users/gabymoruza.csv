Anxiety,fqrds8h,t1_fpijual,1589582389.0,"Hey thank you so much for replying! It’s relieving to see I am not alone and that we have so much in common! I am doing much better and my doc shrugged it off too. I appreciate sharing your experience and you are so right, we must try not to worry and live life to the fullest. God Bless and I hope you have a great day❤️"
Anxiety,fori7p6,t3_g92ezl,1588012666.0,Yep! You are not alone.
Anxiety,forhimh,t3_g949bv,1588012326.0,Fuck anxiety! 😡
Anxiety,forgu3s,t3_g95yhc,1588011997.0,"I’ve had these squeezing, hot, pressure tension headaches before. Mine were because of anxiety I’m sure. Anxiety creates strange physical symptoms that sometimes one can’t even explain! Just letting you know that you’re not alone and to get yourself checked out if it’ll make you feel at peace."
mentalillness,fohddae,t3_g7ftee,1587764073.0,Don’t do this. You have too much ahead of you. People LOVE you. I’m sure you feel terrible but you CAN help yourself! Please call the Suicide hotline if you want to talk to somebody. I call them just for emotional distress.
Anxiety,foeeeba,t3_g71j8y,1587701753.0,I hear you...you are not alone.
dpdr,fodwftc,t3_g6z31q,1587691423.0,"Yes I’ve felt that. It’s because of anxiety, no?"
Anxiety,fodqjk3,t1_fodqduo,1587688233.0,"Good, that’s one step. The next is, yeah let your mind race and express your anger/concern in your head."
Anxiety,fodqakd,t1_fodp90w,1587688100.0,Are you feeling better?
mentalillness,fodpi68,t3_g6ya38,1587687664.0,Good! ❤️👏
Anxiety,fodpevr,t1_fodp90w,1587687614.0,I feel ya! Do a grounding technique! Touch 5 different textures in your room and try to smell 3 different things
Anxiety,fodp51w,t1_fodordb,1587687466.0,"Try breathing techniques and and/or watch funny videos? After you’re all calm, of course."
Anxiety,fodolwd,t1_fodoel2,1587687251.0,What made you panic? Something specific? Nothing? You don’t want to tell our parents how you’re feeling?
Anxiety,fodo993,t1_fodo0vc,1587687131.0,Where are you at? Try walking around or going outside. Are you by yourself? This will pass :)
Anxiety,fodnnxn,t3_g6y2pw,1587686928.0,"Hi, how are you doing?"
Anxiety,fodn1w7,t3_g6xpto,1587686720.0,"I’m so sorry to hear. My Father passed away 2 years ago from cancer. Remember, Your Mom and Your destiny are two separate paths. God bless you both. ❤️💕"
Anxiety,fodgke2,t3_g6so0q,1587684416.0,Yes!
Anxiety,fodg7x7,t3_g6u4dj,1587684297.0,Thank you for sharing. ❤️
Anxiety,fnudj77,t3_g3yxzq,1587259706.0,Why is our brain like this?! I am usually like this too (my anxiety always wants to check in on me). And it’s like self sabotage. It’s a process for sure. I hope you feel better soon. It doesn’t matter how long it takes. I hope you take it day by day and take in the good things. Best of luck!
Anxiety,fnt3pfu,t3_g3s1un,1587234018.0,I’m on the same boat! Having strange beats and impending doom. I had some crazy heart racing yesterday out of nowhere! Affecting work as well. I’ll let you now tips when I get through this. I think we’re in flight or fight mode and anxiety. I wish you the best of luck!
Anxiety,fnqke2c,t3_g3d321,1587166363.0,You are not alone! I am irrationally afraid of dying on a daily basis too. Especially with all these weird heart sensations I’ve been feeling. Sounds like panic disorder. You’ll get through this and I wish you the best of luck!
Anxiety,fneq0zw,t3_g17nei,1586893803.0,I think anxiety is a shape shifter and can come up in many different forms. I’m staring to think that all these physical sensations (ones we’ve felt before and new ones) are due to anxiety. The key is to ignore it (especially after getting checked out and given the “ok”) but it’s SO hard! I really hope you feel better soon. Please take care! : )
Anxiety,fnbzikz,t1_fnbhvbm,1586825465.0,Thank you so much. Everything you said is true and You are so comforting. Yes we’ve lived this long with anxiety and we can do it. We learn and fight though it. I hope to be on your level soon. Take care of yourself!
Anxiety,fnatva8,t3_g0okqq,1586803737.0,Yes God Bless them! My husband is the same. He’s my Hero. My go-to.
Anxiety,fn8aflg,t3_g07hw9,1586737322.0,"Same, you’re not alone. One week is was covid, another was hot flashes and now it’s heart palpitations. Damn anxiety sneaks it’s way in all the time. Hope you feel better."
Anxiety,fn7ejih,t3_g01c0t,1586718758.0,I’m so sorry for what you’ve gone through. I have major cardio phobia as well and it has put me through some real lows this whole quarantine. I get ALOT of palpitations. I’m always focusing on my heart. I feel like it is going to end up getting weak because of all my adrenaline rushes during panic attacks and that I will develop heart failure and slowly die. I think of TOO many scenarios in my head and every little thing I feel puts me in panic and dread mode. I am wearing a holter monitor for a week prescribed by my doc and I hope the results are okay. I have a heart condition so I hope my heart is okay and that it’s all anxiety. I hope you get better slowly. Day by day. It’s hard for others to understand. You’re not selfish; you are strong and you will get through this. Please take it one day at a time!
PanicAttack,fn6128l,t3_fzte4l,1586683269.0,"Yes. All the time, you are not alone. Either my heart races or I feel palpitations and feel that dread as I’m falling asleep. Hang in there!"
Depersonalization,fn19yza,t3_fyoo9n,1586557740.0,I remember it as a child as being in a constant dream-like state. I’d tell my parents “I feel like I’m dreaming” and ask them if they know what I’m talking about.  They’d look at me with compassion but puzzlement. No one could ever answer my question or explain it to me. I think I was disassociating due my panic attacks I’d have as a child. Feeling like I was going to die due to a racing heart. I’m not sure if it was my anxiety or MVP condition that woke me up. But yeah that’s my input.
mentalillness,fn19kap,t3_fyphdg,1586557509.0,I’m glad your psychosis is over. Its good you accept that there are limitations but that you’re still willing to work with it and around it. I hope you feel better day by day. No matter how long it takes!
Anxiety,fmpp6vt,t1_fmnqtne,1586284838.0,"That makes total sense. It’s hard to find that balance but I hope you realize your health is much more important. But I get it, you gotta work to pay the bills. You don’t use alarms?"
Anxiety,fmpp1d5,t1_fmnchnk,1586284761.0,"Wow you’re strong then, crazy dreams like that are strange and I don’t know about you but don’t they leave a lingering eerie feeling? Well I’m glad you push through it to get some rest."
Anxiety,fmpowk4,t1_fmn8nvf,1586284693.0,"Ugh, why does anxiety have to spread elsewhere? That happens to me too. Sometimes it’s my nail biting, sometimes my eating habits, sometimes palpitations, sometimes hot flashes...etc. I felt a possible low point yesterday but I am doing much better today thank God. It just makes me realize that I can surpass a hard time and learn from it. I’m sorry about your low times and I’m glad you’ve gotten pass them. Please take care!"
Anxiety,fmpols7,t1_fmnrlo1,1586284544.0,That’s actually the most common advice that makes the most sense. My husband and I do this and it really helps.
Anxiety,fmpohy1,t1_fmn0sfz,1586284492.0,"Hmm maybe it’s a mix of social and general anxiety? I hate that impending doom feeling. It makes no sense and it kills the groove, huh?"
Anxiety,fmpofae,t1_fmol2ay,1586284454.0,"Well-said. Just got some good sleep last night (thank God) so now it is time to learn and become stronger. Yeah, we got this. And I hope you slowly improve and grapple this anxiety."
Anxiety,fmpo7l8,t1_fmmkspq,1586284342.0,"Yeah and your heart because the only source of noice and feeling in your body, huh? Nice, I do YouTube funny videos on my better days, too. I hope you’ve been doing alright 🙂"
Anxiety,fmpo3d0,t1_fmnkcsa,1586284280.0,"Well you know what I’m glad you got all those things done. That is good proof that it’s all in your mind. And you know what, I can relate to the feeling of wanting another test just to make sure. I have this heart condition called Mitral Valve Prolapse and I got diagnosed a few years back. The doc took it lightly and just told me he’s give me meds if I had more palpitations. Well I did my own research and have found a few negative things about this contusion so I want to get checked up on it.  Gonna get a heart monitor mailed in soon to be recording. Also hearing the doc not to worry about my palpitations is reassuring but at the same time I don’t trust him or myself. It’s weird. But we gotta relax and trust the damn process!"
Anxiety,fmnmwis,t1_fmnl162,1586229852.0,Thank you for all your advice!
Anxiety,fmngfnt,t1_fmna21m,1586225481.0,Amazing response! I’m going to read this over and over for reassurance! I appreciate your input!
Anxiety,fmn8lb6,t1_fmn1vw3,1586220506.0,You have a very strong mindset. I will do this too. Push on until I fall asleep.
Anxiety,fmn73vs,t1_fmmsxlk,1586219596.0,Aww! I hope you feel better. The palpitations are totally anxiety related. Yes they can feel so damn weird that it can leave you spooked for hours 😯
Anxiety,fmn6zp6,t1_fmmulbj,1586219524.0,Amazing. More and more people keep on saying this. I am going to try and control my breathing tonight for sure. And start beginner meditation. I’m so glad you’ve put a handle on it!
Anxiety,fmmoh3d,t1_fmmnyoe,1586209053.0,Yeah I use YouTube videos too but lately the anxiety has been too strong for those. Thank you for sharing!
Anxiety,fmmnhhl,t1_fmmmcf9,1586208521.0,Thank you SO much for your response and suggestion. I will Check this album out! I hope you’re doing well with your anxiety too. Please take care!
Anxiety,fmmnen7,t1_fmmmpkp,1586208479.0,"Thank you SO SO much for the reassurance. I am not going to give up. I’m glad all is good with your heart. :) 
Please take care!"
Anxiety,fmkvcae,t3_fvwleu,1586170072.0,I’m sorry you feel like this. I feel like this too. How do your palpitations feel?
Anxiety,fmkua01,t1_fmkslov,1586168921.0,Thank you so so much for your response! I really appreciate you taking the time to describe your situation. Everything you said makes sense. I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with them on and off but I’m glad you’ve identified that it’s common with your anxiety. I’m more than sure mine are because of anxiety too but yeah it gets hard not to get carried away thinking and feeling.
insomnia,fmkr44n,t3_fvvnrg,1586165344.0,Omg that happened to me a couple of days ago! It’s pure anxiety I’m sure!
insomnia,fmha5s3,t3_fv9sgm,1586072046.0,"I’m on the same boat. I rest a little then wake up super panicked and can’t get myself to go back to sleep. I tried natural supplements with relaxing herbs. Also we need a lot of patience and we need to take this one day at a time and we’ll slightly improve each day. Tea, exercise, meditation, music...you know, all that jazz. I hope you feel better soon!"
Anxiety,fmel59o,t3_futis4,1586007272.0,Let’s believe in ourselves. This WILL pass but damn it’s hard! xD
Anxiety,fmek589,t3_futis4,1586006441.0,"Aww. I feel you! I’m on that same journey. So much dread and panic while falling asleep or falling into sleep. I’m afraid to fall asleep! I’m worried but we’re all experiencing this because of something that is actually threatening (this virus). I can see a road ahead of me now too. It won’t be easy but I see a lot of people are on the same road and I’m sure we’ll all eventually triumph. A road in regards to insomnia and trying to get our sleep back in order, that is!"
Anxiety,fmejv6g,t3_fut7f5,1586006203.0,"OMG yes! I’m 27 too and also experiencing this hot sensation in my body! Ive felt it in my ears, face, forehead, neck and shoulders. It’s new to me so I’ve been feeling fearful about it. But I called a doc and he says it’s extreme flight-or-flight. I have that hot sensation wake me up at night (also with palpitations) and it’s been so hard to sleep. This is happening to me this instance. I can’t go back to sleep because I burn up with dread and panic!"
Anxiety,fme7jlv,t1_fme720i,1585992714.0,Excellent response! 👏
insomnia,fmaxbpo,t1_fmawp7o,1585911487.0,I know it sounds cliché to say but I hope we come out of this with a big lesson and more tools for our toolkit. This WILL pass eventually and we just gotta hold on to hope and try every day. Gotta give diffident techniques a chance each day.
insomnia,fmawcfj,t1_fmavs91,1585910407.0,"It’s okay, these things happen. Especially during this pandemic more than ever. Well my coping mechanism is taking deep breaths and focusing on that and relaxing. then I have watching a movie. I also have sitting in a cool area on the floor and doing this (reading reddit posts). also trying to fall asleep in a different place. 

Yeah my eyes are super sleepy but I’m too restless. Do you feel restless?"
insomnia,fmavnh0,t3_fu5ulg,1585909624.0,"Hello! You are NOT alone. I am having difficulty too. I fall asleep but it’s been restless because I jolt awake, panicked with palpitations. I don’t understand since I though my mind was calm. Right now I keep on waking up with an intense hot feeling in my head and then I freak out for no reason when I wake up. Repeat cycle. I’m used to the racing heart/palpitations but this hot sensation is weirding me out."
Anxiety,fm8mvqm,t1_fm7sktn,1585852262.0,So you’re on anxiety meds now not heart meds?
Anxiety,fm8mrsi,t1_fm7k445,1585852205.0,Omg Haha we got a similar genetics cocktail xD I hope you’re doing okay with everything that’s going on!
Anxiety,fm7gyxo,t1_fm7acvc,1585826642.0,You know what that sounds pretty whimsical and cool but I’d be afraid to have an OBE lol. But I’m all seriousness it sounds like you have your anxiety under control and that’s great. Thank you for sharing!
Anxiety,fm78pb3,t1_fm7846x,1585817369.0,I think our body gets weak from anxiety and all the chemicals that our brain has released causes heaviness.
Anxiety,fm77gtz,t1_fm76h2o,1585816044.0,Great response 👍🏼
insomnia,fm77cqz,t3_ftiiwh,1585815921.0,"I’m sorry to hear. I’ve been really anxious and fear the night so I’ve been going to sleep around 5am. I sleep a little then panic and jolt awake. You’ll regain your cycle soon enough, I wish you mental strength!"
Anxiety,fm6txhf,t3_ftfylq,1585803140.0,I know how you feel. I feel the same with impending doom and 24/7 anxiety and constant panic attacks. I know it’s hard to become at ease and to follow other people’s advice and just everything is easier said than done. A few things I’d recommend is music in the background and watching a funny movie. I hope you feel better. Good luck!
Anxiety,fm564n7,t1_fm4n6mb,1585767028.0,"Oh wow it is good to see I’m not alone. I mean of course I’m sorry you’re feeling it too. It feels weird huh? and yeah they’re pretty much brought up by anxiety. It’s just annoying because when I feel something different due to anxiety I freak out and think it’s a bad illness or something. I hope you feel better and experience them less. We’ll get through this, it’s just the pandemic causing us extreme anxiety."
Anxiety,fm3qsh2,t3_fswied,1585733488.0,It happens. I’ve been sleeping at 6am due to all the anxiety I can’t control too. Are you anxious about the epidemic?
Anxiety,fm3pqnx,t3_fsw722,1585732368.0,I am so sorry you’re going through this and I wish you a speedy recovery. I did not not that sinus problems were part of the symptoms? So you guys can’t get tested? And your fear is totally rational.
PanicAttack,fm3pi0s,t1_fm33wsr,1585732111.0,I see. So you’re worried about you might have that hereditarily condition and also about catching coronavirus. Yeah it sucks when you’ve been on a streak of everything being okay but then panic attacks return. It’s going to be okay. It’s all due to the excessive worry we’re feeling for the virus! Stay strong 😃
PanicAttack,fm338k9,t3_fsrhk7,1585711739.0,"Hiya, I’m going through heavy anxiety and frequent panic attacks lately too. I’m sure it’s the corona virus just making us feel so bad. What do you feel?"
Anxiety,fm0glk2,t3_fsbsjs,1585657135.0,Oh yeah! I get really bad knee joint pain for some reason.
Anxiety,fm03t9u,t1_fm03f7h,1585643594.0,I see. So when you get very anxious the hot flashes start. And sometimes the hot flashes get so intense they become nauseating. Thank you for elaborating. I am trying to make sense of my hot flashes as well. I think they’re happening because of immense stress and anxiety. Please take care. I think this is all because of our anxiety towards this pandemic.
Anxiety,fm03609,t3_fs91ai,1585642869.0,Hello good evening. I’m too much paying extra attention to my physical symptoms due to anxiety as well. I’ve been having hot flashes on and off since yesterday and I am worried. I have no fever or cough either but I am concerned about the hot flashes since I’ve never really felt them before. Could you share more about the hot flashes?
Anxiety,fm02ugc,t3_fs8jeh,1585642514.0,"Omg I can relate with the physical symptoms! It’s always something new I experience with anxiety. I freak out because I haven’t felt it before but then after a while, I realize it’s normal (I guess) due to panic/anxiety so I accept it. For me it’s been this hot flash feeling I can’t shake off since yesterday. I’ve looked it up and feel some kind of reassurance but then I spiral back into doubt and worry. But yes when i experience some new physical sensation due to anxiety and panic that I haven’t felt before...oh boy, it gets really tough. I hope you feel better and keep on working through it. And I hope you remember that we’re feeling this anxiety harder due to the current world situation. 👍🏼"
Anxiety,fm02jf3,t3_fs8xl7,1585642178.0,"Hi there, I woke up feeling off in the opposite way. Feeling hot (but no temp). I think it has to do with our anxiety towards this whole pandemic."
Anxietyhelp,flzxk5i,t3_fre0bz,1585636895.0,Yes it can trigger underlying anxiety. And enhances physical symptoms like palpitations. I feel like decaf actually makes a difference.
panicdisorder,flzwbqi,t3_frgzw4,1585635664.0,I’m glad to hear your recovery time is getting shorter. You are improving and learning how to handle it better. There is hope and you are learning how to handle it.
Anxietyhelp,flzw4gb,t1_flz30hq,1585635467.0,"I see. Yeah major dental work can be nerve wracking. I’m sorry to hear about your MVP flaring up. Please keep an eye on it and remember that anxiety causes your mvp to flare up and that it’s all connected. Our hearts are the troopers, the real MVPs 😁"
Anxiety,flzvwi0,t3_fs7659,1585635252.0,"Same, been having panic attacks so often and I’m feeling weird side effects because of it. Try and sleep whenever you can to clear your brain static. Even if it’s during the day. You got this. Good luck!"
Anxiety,flzvk0n,t3_fs72mo,1585634931.0,You are not alone. It effing sucks but sometimes we cannot control our anxiety but rather let it pass and learn that it’s all part of it. I know the mental breakdowns and messed up sleep schedules take a toll but it’s all due to this pandemic that is causing a collective anxiety attack. You got this. Stay strong!
Anxietyhelp,flyx5w2,t1_flyv443,1585610916.0,Oh wow really? I’m glad I’m not alone and I know how you feel waking up with a racing heart. It sucks but it’s happened so much to me that I just kinda wait for it to be over. Interesting about the hot flashes for you. I’m sure it’s because of this pandemic. Our collective anxieties are all going through the roof. Thank you so much for your reply!
Anxietyhelp,flxuuck,t1_flx7kz4,1585590255.0,Thank you so much for your opinion! What you’re saying makes total sense 😊
Anxiety,flwxd1f,t3_frp94u,1585568774.0,"Heya! I just posted a similar experience a few minutes ago. 

Yeah, like you feel flushed or like you’re having hot flashes? But no actual fever?"
dpdr,flwplau,t3_fqcpbh,1585559984.0,Thank you for sharing; God Bless!
panicdisorder,flwo28v,t3_fp7c50,1585558178.0,"Yes yes yes, panic attacks through the roof! I’ve been feeling weird things I’ve not felt before but it all subsides when I relax. I keep on binging on the media despite knowing it does no good. Been having trouble sleeping and been freaking out on a daily basis. It desert help that we must stay home and that the media is 80% negative, 20% positive...but we will get through this. If anything, this situation will test our anxiety/panic disorder and give us a lesson for future use...⭐️"
panicdisorder,flwnj4s,t3_fqzkv0,1585557562.0,Yes it sounds like a panic attack. You did a good job handling everything. I wish you the best of luck in dealing with this!
Anxiety,flwigw2,t1_flwg168,1585551861.0,"You're not alone. I have many ""health conditions"" I've diagnosed myself with too. I always go to Google to inform myself of EVERY little thing I feel ""off"" or ""different""...it's hard to share this with people because you feel they think you're nuts and annoying. This Virus news is NOT helping either. It is very crippling (panic attacks) and I sympathize with the mental toll you're feeling. I feel trapped and suffocated and have been waking up totally panicked and it takes me a few hours to finally relax. You can get through this, this is a novel kind of thing we're dealing with and i'm sure some of your anxiety will calm when all this is over. Please believe in yourself and keep it up."
Anxiety,flwhv1f,t3_frhufp,1585551222.0,"Hi there! Yeah same here, i get TOO much physical feelings...oof. Im not really aware or thinking and then BAM i get physical symptoms. From that same gut feeling you mentioned, to feeling suffocated, to violent shaking, to hot flashes, to palpitations, to chest pain, to dizziness, to nausea...lol anxiety is full of surprises >:("
