I felt really guilty for awhile because I have two younger siblings, who thankfully weren't ever really targeted by my nmom, but I feel like that just means now that I'm gone, she'll move on to my siblings. My nmom was severely physically abusive and has caused a few permanent injuries that I didn't go to the hospital for. My jaw was dislocated and ever now and then will dislocate again if I eat something hard or sleep wrong. I have ADHD and she didn't know how to handle it, so she put me on concerta in kindergarten through 7th grade. Sometimes she'd make me take 2 pills if we were going somewhere like a wedding or out somewhere nice. I was really underweight for most of my life because of it and have had migraines at least twice a week for as long as I can remember. 

I moved out a few weeks after graduation and ended up moving in with my boyfriend a few months later.
I worked full time (50+ hrs a week) for 2 years and then decided I wanted to go to school because I didn't see myself going anywhere and was tired of working a job I didn't like. I got psychiatric help for the first time in my life and was diagnosed with manic depression, generalized anxiety and complex PTSD. Got back on ADHD meds as well as antidepressants, but recently it feels like they aren't making a difference. 

I still have to deal with it though because I'm now going to school, and they refuse to co-sign loans and manipulate me by ""paying"" for my rent (they pay when they want to, racking up late fees or not paying at all). I'm under 24, so there's nothing I can do except suffer for a few years more ig.

Things are really rough right now, as they decided they aren't going to pay my rent anymore and never told me, so I had to use my student loan to pay for this months rent and am now in the negatives in my bank account. I've got no way of paying for anything at the moment because I'm unable to work due to severe depressive episodes that have caused me to become very sick. 

Honestly, I don't think most people ever really ""escape"" child abuse, because the effects it has are lifelong one way or another. I've forgiven my nmom, but just today I urged her to get help, because I do really care about and love them. But she of course said nothing was wrong with them and that ""not trying to hurt your feelings, but things have been a lot better since you left"". So I mean idk 
Shit like that sticks with you for life. I think it's a serious issue that isn't talked about as much as it should be. Many victims don't ever escape; they get into abusive relationships because that's what they're used to. Those who are lucky enough to find someone caring still have to deal with the psychological effects of abuse/untreated injuries for the rest of their lives.

Tldr; most victims never really ""escape"""

Lol no. YOU think tipping is necessary . Tipping isn't a requirement. *That's why it's called a tip, not a fee.*

Drivers don't have to jump through anything. In rare circumstance, the process to reach a customers door may be difficult due to gates or buzz ins, but I know for a fact that rarely happens, because most complexes I've been to are accessible without any kind of key. You're also aware of this possibility every single time you press ""accept"".No one is forcing you to deliver. YOU chose to deliver. I'm sure you and the group of people on this subreddit who have cognitive dissonance are expecting everyone to agree with you and your lackluster customer service, but I don't, and clearly the customers don't either. This service is no different from the pizza or chinese food delivery drivers'. They deliver to the door, just like you're supposed to. You aren't special just because you don't work for a specific restaurant and call yourself a ""contractor"".

Entitled? That's a good way to describe the people on here who assume everyone has a car lmfao.""If they don't like it, they can pick up their own order."" Wow.Yeah? Should everyone stop using couriers so that you'll be out of a job?

*Just look for parking*?Yeah it should be that easy, but it seems to me that it isn't that easy, considering the complaints customers have as well as my own experiences with people calling me and either asking me to meet them, or saying ""ok I'm here"" expecting me to meet them outside.There are instances where parking may be full, and you may not know where visitor parking is, or if there's a kiss-and-ride within the premises, or if they perhaps have a reserved spot BUT DON'T HAVE A CAR (*LIKELY THE REASON THEY'RE ORDERING FROM UBEREATS*). That's why you ask about parking in certain situations .How would you know where it's illegal to park in a complex without them saying ""park in the fire lane"", and where and how often would there be a residential area that doesn't have overflow space for parking?Very rarely is parking ""far away"" because it's way more expensive for a residence to own a complex and a parking lot than it is to incorporate parking within the complex, very close to the individual buildings .Paying out of pocket for parking is stupid, sure, I agree, but I'd imagine that would be a situation when someone is delivering to a business, not a residential area. It makes zero sense for a residential parking area to require payment and I'm certain that wouldn't be a very effective way at collecting money or bringing in new tenants.

You should be more concerned with the fact that Uber doesn't reimburse you and should be writing that off as a business expense on your taxes, or you should just, i dunno, stop working for a company that does shit like that?

Relying on ""trust"" for tips is a stupid way to look at the service industry, sorry. As I've said, tips aren't mandatory and I'm sure after dealing with some jag off who doesn't want to deliver to the door despite having a place to park, a customer is going to have a bad taste in their mouth about he service provider and tipping. You and all of these other people crying about stupid shit on reddit and about how they're so brave for confronting customers about not tipping are doing far more harm than good. This toxic mentality of ""I deserve a tip no matter what"" is literally destroying the tipping industry in america lol. The more you nutcases pop off at customers for not tipping, the more customers are going to be less likely to tip, and judging by how common this toxic mentality is becoming, I'd say the future of tipping in america is looking bleak. Especially paired up with the nasty and entitled attitudes of some couriers.

&#x200B;

You and others who will read this can downvote me all you'd like, but I not only don't give a shit about brownie points on social media, but I'm also being real with you. I'm not going to delude you and myself into thinking that tips are mandatory and that you don't have to do a job properly in order to get paid.

Either get over yourself and find a way to enjoy your job, or fuck off to another career path. It's that simple. Don't try bringing up the ""this is the only job I can get"" or the ""I can only work these types of jobs because I don't have a degree"" and shit like that. That's on no one but you.If you really need to rely on the idea that ""oh this is all I can do"" and are going to expect everyone to be kind and expect them to tip, then clearly this isn't the right industry for you. That's just how it is. Not everyone is kind, and not everyone will tip. No amount of complaining and whining will ever change that.

You're not just ruining a customers experience, you're also harming yourself by having to force yourself to complete tasks you hate. Don't work a job that you hate. It's not healthy for you, and its not pleasant to your customer.I really want to drive this home since clearly its not getting through to you and others of the same mind set.

**Either get over yourself and stop expecting the world to be your oyster, or find another job elsewhere. You decide how you life is and what you do. You've either already decided by fucking up earlier in life, or you're actively deciding your outcome. Regardless, even, of fuck ups or laziness, you can wake up and stop accepting whatever it is that you're having issues with. Stop relying on the pity and justification of others who have the same shit attitude and world view, they're literally only dragging you down with them. Change your life. There's always a way. Being pessimistic and lazy will only hinder positive change.**"
UberEATS,f6sreqt,t1_f6spg1i,1573138694.0,"I agree that she was being a lazy bastard, but again, I'm just explaining how many would perceive your ""ok?"". I'm sure you weren't trying to be rude, or maybe you were a bit annoyed and that effected your response (I really have to try hard sometimes not to flip out at some of these couriers. They'll literally call me and be like ""ok I'm here"" ?????? as if I live on the sidewalk) 
I really want to stress that I now understand that you didn't intend to be rude, however most people will view an ""ok?"" as attitude. 

I personally would never walk over to a stranger's car, even if they're my delivery driver (doesn't mean there's no chance of something happening). Even if your crime rate is low, it's still not safe to approach a stranger's car, with the exception of transportation services. That's why couriers are supposed to meet you at your door. It's safer. 

Not saying you were in the wrong, because as I've said before, you're paying for delivery from restaurant to door, she wasn't doing her job. Just letting you know that your responses may be misinterpreted and that it's best to respond neutrally, if that makes sense.

I really don't get why couriers think it's ok to pull shit like this, other than because they see people on this subreddit doing similar shit, being encouraged by people in the comments. And then they demand tips, even going as far as ranting to the customer when they open the door. Fuck off to another career choice if you don't like this one.

 I'm so fucking sick of little assholes using mental illness as a fucking accessory. Shitty shows like 13 reasons why, or w/e the fuck it's called, completely bastardizing and misrepresenting mental illness, making it cute to have depression. I'm so sick of it. I've missed 2 weeks of school because I had elevated anxiety last Wednesday that caused me to clench my jaw really tight all day, and I ended up dislocating it last Thursday because of that. 
I've been in a manically depressed episode for about a month now and it's getting worse because I'm disappointed in myself for not attending class. It's like I don't want to do anything. I don't even want to do nothing. It's worrying because I've increased my dosage for my antidepressant, but I feel like eventually I'll run out of things to help me and it'll just be downhill from there. 


Mental illness isn't a fucking pair of earrings that you get to take off at the end of the day and mix and match them with your outfit. 
They are debilitating illnesses that effect people mentally AND PHYSICALLY. They fucking suck. I've always said that people who suffer from mental illness don't talk about their suffering. That's why many people suffer silently; mental illness often literally makes it nearly impossible to talk about what you're going through, in fear of looking crazy or being embarrassed.  The ones constantly talking about ""oh I'm soo depressed :-("" , I don't believe have any issues other than with attention. 

I hate struggling with BPD among other mental issues, and if there was anyway I could get rid of them, there's not much I wouldn't do.

Next time, I'd recommend giving/explaining a place to park (especially if your spots are numbered). If that doesn't seem to work, explain to them that you are unable to meet them at their car because you either don't feel comfortable doing so, or because you're busy, and are literally paying to have food delivered to your door. I sympathize with you in a sense that there are absolutely a lot of ubereats couriers that are lazy as fuck and are constantly crying about it on this subreddit for justification from other assholes, but keep in mind what you read on here.

Honestly, it's not that hard. Does delivery driving suck? Yeah, it does. Is the pay nice? Not at all. But you don't have to deliver for ubereats. In fact, you don't have to deliver at all. You don't have to like what I'm saying, but you're working not just in the ""food industry"", technically, but you're also working in hospitality in a way.

I'd cancel their order. But seriously, the complaining on this subreddit is so annoying and immature.

grubhub,f39s265,t3_daan1c,1570754624.0,"I think America has a toxic tipping culture, and the evidence is in this comment section. 
Sorry if this pisses people off, but that's the truth.

 I also worked in hospitality, but I have literally never felt the urge to bitch out someone because they didn't give me a tip. Was it annoying that they didn't tip me? Yes. But I also understand that tipping isn't mandatory/required, and the customer isn't the one I'm employed by. That's why it's called a tip and not a fee.
 
I think the entitlement people have towards tipping is ridiculous, and I also think it's ruining the hospitality industry. It's not just delivery drivers that I've seen going postal on people for not tipping, it's other areas of hospitality as well. By having this ""tipping is required"" attitude, they're reinforcing these cheapskate companies's ability to rely on the customers to pay the difference in their employees wage. Rome wasn't built in a day, but demanding tips is only digging yourself a hole in the long term. Until companies start paying a legitimate wage, this whole mentality is going to give companies more reason NOT to raise wages. The more blatant people become with their entitlement issues, the more people are going to start looking at tipping negatively.  
Some people don't tip. Get over it imo. 


""Oh well if they could afford to eat out, they can afford to tip."" 

No not really. In the instance of courier services like Ubereats and GrubHub, I know they have coupons that can essentially get a customer a free meal. They could very well be using those coupons or gift cards to get something to eat when they're in a tough place financially.

""They shouldn't be ordering food if they're in a tough place financially"" 

Again, they could be using coupons/gift cards. Some people are disabled or sick and can't leave the house or struggle to leave the house. Others may not have cars and are unable to get to the store for whatever reason. 


Some people may come from other countries (pretty much everywhere except the US) where tipping isn't a thing, and they may not be aware of how tipping in America works. 



Idk. I always tip, but I keep coming across threads where this toxic attitude regarding tipping breeds, and it makes me not want to tip for the sake of not tipping. Tips are a bonus, not a requirement. Acting like an asshole isn't going to get you tips. It's going to get you the opposite. You haven't educated anyone by screaming at them. If anything, you've probably turned them off from tipping permanently. Customers aren't your employer. Direct your anger at the companies who rely on the customer to pay your wage."

Everyone knows communication is important, but I don't think everyone knows how seriously important it is. I don't know what personality types you guys are, but both me and my SO are predispose to communication issues. I'm definetly the type to sit around and mope about something instead of talk about it. 
Stop doing this. 
I cannot tell you how much better you'll feel if you talk about these types of things with your partner. Maybe you're clingy like I was (low key still am). So what? Maybe talking to him about this will help him budget some time to spend with you. Someone can't fix a problem if they don't know about it. 
Any time you have feelings about something , don't supress them. You have to communicate. Good communication in a relationship seriously makes an unbelievable difference. Its like being in sync with your SO.
Talk to him about your feelings. Let him know that you don't want him not to go, but you do want to spend more time with him sometime during the summer. Make sure to take into consideration the feelings and opinions he will express to you in response. Both of your feelings matter equally. I don't think you're being selfish, but it's definitely important to value your SOs feelings and put yourself in their perspective. Many times we think only about ourselves and how we're feeling, but we don't think about how they might be feeling. 
 It takes time to learn to communicate, because you both have different ways of doing so, but it'll be so worth it, trust me. 
If you're seriously invested in this guy, I would recommend you two take a personality test. It will explain everything from communication to how a personality type expresses love and how they want love to be expressed. 

Sorry for the long ass text post, but I immediatly saw myself in this post and I know I wouldve wanted help back then, so hopefully this will make a lasting difference in you guyses relationship.
