It makes me sick to think all of these famous people can get tests right away but regular people out there working cannot.  What you do is absolutely vital.  There are so many elderly who depend on workers like yourself and have no one else.  It makes me sad how the attitudes of some seem to be so callous, especially toward the elderly.  My grandmother is 86 and tomorrow I'm taking all kinds of food and supplies to her home.  If I don't no one else will.  

THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!

Please stay safe and remember you are valued and appreciated."

I guess my reason for coming here was I wanted to have some information before I spoke with him.  I worry so much for his safety but I know he's a smart kid and can handle himself.  I just didn't want to add more stress to what's already a stressful time.  

As far as the makeup thing his eyeliner is on freaking point.  I'm a little jealous honestly lol.  He's so damned beautiful though 💜

Thank you so much for the insight!"
