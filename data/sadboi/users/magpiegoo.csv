Ultimately their dress selection was giving me more variety in the top department (while still giving back coverage, shoulder, a semi-decent high front), where their tops had far fewer in that area, tending to quickly go into either long sleeves or halternecks which both ruled them out.

I went to a friend's and tried out stretching some latex sheet, and pinning some sheet around my chest, and I'm pretty hopeful that so long as I get the right size (they seem to have an ok policy for exchanges for a different size which is good), it should give me enough support to see me through an evening.

They offer cups on one catsuit and one top (based on the catsuit), but as it's my first latex I don't want something that covering.

Yes

> because people didn't like the term soulbond

However, no. As I said, it came from a cross-over with the multiplicity community. To provide more detail, SoulBonds, or to be more exact, ex-SoulBonds, and ""fictives"" (that term didn't exist yet) who probably never were SoulBonds, were finding their way into other communities, such as fictionkin communities (where people resonated with their identities in a way these people more innately understood), and multiplicitly communities (where their plurality should have fit in better). But there was an issue. SoulBonders *weren't plural*, at least at the time, and back then these people could only really call themselves SoulBonds. So they were basically saying ""I'm a singlet putting it on a bit, can I hang out with all you multiples in your safe space?""

They were told to, in the parlance of my local area, ""get tae fuck"".

Realising that this was an untenable situation, that they *weren't* SoulBonds or that the term was restricting them by causing confusion and conveying false connotations (not that they didn't like the term, but that it simply *didn't describe their situation*), a goodly number of people, primarily from the SoulBonding community on LiveJournal as you say, came up with fictive.

Fictives are headmates of fictional origin. This can be popular or original fiction, although often if it's original fiction people discover they based the fiction off of the headmate meaning they're not a fictive after all.

SoulBonds are fictional characters (again, can be popular or original) that may or may not be headmates (they do not have to have moved into the system, in fact for the longest time that didn't happen or was uncommon) and may or may not exist as spiritual or even real beings. The term originated with *writers* not plurals and referred to characters in their stories and fanfic that would ""talk to them"", and these characters were not even originally believed to be real in any way. After much community struggle the idea that these characters could be in some way real began to be accepted, then slowly the idea that they could front.

The idea that they could be headmates, particularly ones that deserved any kind of rights, lead to a cross-over with the multiplicity community and the birth of the term ""fictive"".

SoulBond gets used as interchangeable with fictive a lot these days, but it's really not. Fictive was coined specifically because it's not. SoulBonds are characters, generally living in their own worlds or otherwise not in the host's head, and (even if they are) their existence is characterised by a power imbalance towards the SoulBonder. The SoulBonder has the control, the SBer has the final say. In many ways, SBing relationships with people who have moved in are very questionably ethical because the person lives with you now, but you're still holding all the cards.

If you start to find that a character has moved in and has equal or a representative say over your life, you're dealing with a fictive.

The idea of rapid logging is to be able to get your thoughts out quickly before they vanish. It's born of ADHD where that happens constantly. Drawing a daily or weekly spread that takes 5 minutes instead of 2 or 3 is hopefully not going to prevent you from rapid logging your thoughts before they disappear, because you're focusing on a specific task. If your ADHD is causing problems within those few minutes, you're probably used to your condition and to bullet journaling and know to say, keep a dedicated dotpad next to you while you set up, in which to log thoughts that you then immediately transfer. This would be true even if your set up only took a minute, anything more than writing the date at the top really.

That's someone with ADHD. If you don't have attention problems, or you can easily manage your attention problems, you can spend longer periods on set up and you still won't be losing the benefits of rapid logging b/c rapid logging is a *note taking* system, not a set up system.

There'll be a point at which a design is no longer basic, but where that point is is *still* subjective. Even under your view, it's still subjective. How rapid does it have to be before it's getting in the way of my ADHD brain rapid logging? Surely *I* get to determine that?"

As someone whose spreads tend to use confined boxes, a couple of reasons exist for this for me.

One is that I like the routine. It's comforting. The other is that I provide myself the space I have generally needed as a maximum. And if I don't fill in that space, it's not a loss. My week still takes up a page, my day still takes up a page, no matter how much I write. I will still need to do all 7 days a page for a week, I will still need my time bar and mood box on a daily even if I only write 2 notes that day.  So it's no gain to me to shrink or enlarge my note sections.

Writing notes where I could find any day on any page OTOH, doesn't help my brain locate days for easy migrating or referencing.

A weekly planner doesn't give me the flexibility to create spreads that work for me, in the size and shapes that work for me, or to throw in collections that I need.

Those are my reasons, idk if they help to convey the ""other side"" to you or not. I'm sure others have other reasons."

I can't speak to whether this is internalised transphobia.

tarot,fgmqe9z,t3_ezdfbt,1580929933.0,"Some things I've been building into my life:

* Daily draw - This actually didn't work for me. Short term the meanings were good but eventually I found them difficult to apply to my day, and combined with having to write them down every day, that became a spoon drain. So I have replaced that with-
* Weekly draw - Same principle except it's a card for the week ahead, *and* if I find I ""don't get it"", because it's only once a week, I have a notebook in which I can do a short bit of journaling about the card, why I don't get it, how it made me feel, maybe some general notes about the card. Speaking of which-
* Tarot journaling - Only once every other week for me (aside from the above anyway), but just journaling about tarot related thoughts, a card that's been bugging me, or whatever really.
* Tarot exercises - So there are actual tarot study books, Tarot 101 is one of them and I've been working through that. There are others, I think the classic Tarot For Yourself is another? They're great for giving you something to do, helping you fill a notebook with tarot stuff without just doing constant readings.
* Build your own meanings - The above two things will help with this, but I also have a separate notebook that I dedicate to brainstorming out the card. Bit by bit I just, build up a picture of the card, from mindmapping out based on its number or name, to musing on its symbology, to gazing at the card and essentially free writing, to just collecting my favourite meaning quotes from sites and books. I've got a really big (I dunno, bigger than A4 maybe?) notebook waiting for me to finish and boil down my brain dump into ""my"" meanings, in a nice easily accessible format.
* Practice readings - If you're worried that reading for yourself all the time could be a problem (and yeah it can be, I think you can end up retreading the same ground, or asking inane questions and then searching for meaning in the cards), practice questions can be the way to go. If you believe the tarot to be a mirror or other form of method that is essentially ""not psychic"", you may benefit from a book called ""2000 Tarot Practice Questions"". It's exactly what it says, and it even provides a name for the querent, but obviously these are all made up and not ""real"" people asking real questions so if you need that energetic connection that's not helpful. What might be more helpful in that case is asking tarot about movie or book characters. They're ""real"" on some level, their stories have energy, and an answer you can confirm sooner or later. Great for reading practice.

So you have cisgender, which means your gender is ""on the same side"" as your assigned gender. And you have transgender, which conveys the idea that your gender is not ""on the same side"" as your assigned gender, it is on another side, with cool additional ideas of your gender going across or through the social boundaries of gender.

It does not and has never had anything to do with transitioning. The fact that transition and transgender start with the same prefix is because the prefix is useful to both words (to trans-ition is to move across a boundary, to go to another side, you see). Transgender *and* transition draw from the root latin ""Trans-"". Transgender does not draw from transition.

> it's sort of like suggesting to someone who says that they identify as Vietnamese that they should just use the term 'Asian' instead - even if one technically falls under the umbrella of the other, it's a back-step in specificity.

Kemetic,fgil4ol,t3_eyipe1,1580824771.0,"I think that this is a difficult subject. It's easy to jump to what are essentially almost platitudes, because we're so used to a modern, western view on mental health.

Firstly, that modern western view, because it's important. This *isn't* your fault. You are unwell. That needs to be recognised.

However, it also needs to be balanced against a kinda, Kemetic reality. If, being unwell, you let your rubbish pile up, and that rubbish contributes to your bad mental health, we can all jump in and say ""but you're unwell, that's not your fault!"", but does that change that you're letting the trash pile up and it's affecting your mental health more? No. It doesn't. So we can look at what is happening, admit it's not your fault, but also face the fact that it's probably not good for you.

Isfet and mental health, is a lot like that. So thoughts, words, etc, are heka. The words you say to yourself, they're heka. You're putting that heka into the world, into your life, into *you*. So whether it's your fault or not, you need to address the kind of heka you want to be doing. And whether you believe this is heka or not, it's psychology, the words we say to ourselves affect our mental health.

This is a hard process. All mental health work is. It's hard and it's slow. You won't overnight just magically be able to go, I want to swap to good positive heka that benefits Ma'at now, and boom just switch. That won't happen. But you can make the choice to start on it, and whenever you notice the negative spirals, try and catch them and say ""yeah but I don't want to think like that"". And that'll suck for a long time but eventually it'll get easier, and maybe you can catch it a little earlier, or you can say ""yeah but I don't think like that"" (even if you don't mean it, fake it 'till you make it).

If you bother to look, this is monotheism. Most pagans would still call it ""soft polytheism"" though, to avoid the uncomfortable introspection and association with other religious paths.

However, they do not mandate this belief in their followers to the best of my knowledge. You can be KO and polytheist.

To your question: You can be Kemetic and polytheist. If anything, I would recommend it. Kemetic Orthodoxy is one religious group, and while I don't know how many scholars it has active, I would put my money firmly on Erik Hornung being more specialised in *this* particular area of Egyptian belief than most if not all of their scholars. Read his book, Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and The Many. It's excellent. It spends all of 2 seconds on the idea of Egypt being monotheistic, before dismissing it as the arrogant projections of Victorian ""Egyptologists"" who wanted to make Egypt more palatable. The entire rest of the book is about Egypt's polytheism and how it works. It's very thorough and very good.

Those are common and powerful images during the periods that Set is *not* vilified. They're some of the most iconic images of the peak of Egypt's power.

The second Dynasty is ""not long"" after the unification of Egypt, but it *is* after the unification of Egypt, and there, because it is still early in the unified Egypt's history (so they're quite ""YOLO"" about tradition still), you have kings outright putting Set on their Serekhs, sometimes alone."

I realised that the original idea, the neuroatypical founded idea (which is amazing and makes so much sense when I look at the basics!), was really simple and easy and takes 0 artistic talent or imagination, and relatively little time to set up.

Mine is fractionally more fancy than that. I use a brush pen for my page titles, oooooo. Lol. But that's about the limit of it. And it's great! It's totally ok if you just bullet journal pages of to-do notes, just use the method to keep track of them, migrate them, and whittle them down in a meaningful way. That's the core of it. So long as it turns your to-do notes into something you can easily access and use to help your life, that's what matters.

But to answer as best I can:

* I had a trial lesson. It was... intense. The lesson started in my target language, although the tutor had kinda like flashcards prepared so that no matter my level I would be ok. He would hold up what he was saying in the target language, then flip it if I looked slightly confused, hold up a possible response, that kind of thing. That went on for a short while, hi how are you, I'm from country name, I've been studying for X months, I am X years old. Eventually he stopped and went into English to talk about how he does things, and to get a better feel for where I'm at. Then finally did more in the target language, this time with a bit more correction, and then we closed. It was intense but it was very good.
* When I was doing my lessons I was aiming for 1 a week. If I was doing it now I would probably do 1 every second week, and just study myself in between. This is purely because I don't have a lot of time to study so my progress is slower, meaning I don't have a lot to take to the lesson, and I don't like the pressure of having to have improved (whether that's real pressure or my anxiety) every week right now. Personally I prefer sticking to one tutor because you build a relationship with them and you remember what you've talked about. But I can see how having two might be helpful if you find their different methods help you in different ways.
* My tutor is flexible. We can just talk in the target language, we can set a topic the week before or via italki messages, or whatever. It can be a topic for conversation like talking about cars, or it can be ""this week I need to work on this aspect of grammar"" and maybe he'll tailor the conversations to that, and he knows to help me on that in English as well, he's prepared for it. Also, his lessons have a set structure regardless, which is: ""Gentle"" target language, where he's encouraging you to talk but not correcting you much really. English, where you discuss learning. And then more target language, but this time he corrects your grammar mistakes and stuff.

I just booked it without messaging, but italki says once you've booked it to message them with some info about where your studies are at etc, and I think I did that."

In short, were you kicked because they disagreed vehemently with something you said or did, or were you kicked *purely* because there was a ""takeover""?

ehlersdanlos,ffqlc3i,t1_ffqdegn,1580137686.0,"> For what other condition would that be entertained?

Being transgender isn't a condition. For what ""other"" condition is a false premise to start with. So, admitting they don't have gender dysphoria isn't a problem, and there should be no reason to get worked up about it happening.

> Transition is the indicated treatment for transsexualism.

Transition is the indicated treatment for *gender dysphoria*. What century are you living in? Even then it is *completely voluntary* and like all treatments of symptoms that produce mental distress, it has to be balanced carefully against the patient's wants and needs, what will relieve their distress, what will cause more distress.

""You're trans so you should transition"" is one of the *least* medically accurate views I've seen from a transmedicalist in a while.

> ""Being trans"" without meeting the criteria for being trans, namely the one central symptom, is nonsensical.

You have decided that meeting the medical criteria for the disorder ""Gender Dysphoria"" is the central symptom of being trans. To most of the rest of the world, *not identifying as the gender you were assigned at birth* is the central symptom of being trans, and it is not identifying as the gender you were assigned at birth that *results in* (much of the time) gender dysphoria.

If I go to a GIC, and they refuse to diagnose me as having gender dysphoria (I have GD FWIW before you lose your shit and call me a ""tucute"", but lets speculate about gatekeepers for a second, lol), they will *not* invalidate me as a trans person. Because they know that not meeting the criteria for having GD doesn't mean I'm not *trans* and they're not going to risk their jobs to invalidate my personal identity, a thing they have no ability to comment on.

That's the actual medical establishment, the people with authority. The kind of people you're supposedly bowing to here.

That said, as I've said a lot of the people who don't think they have GD would probably end up being diagnosed with GD if they got shuttled through a GIC. The problem is they've never actually thought about the ""more unusual"" ways GD can present, other than hating your bits.

Which, boiled down, means you're labelling ""actually trans"" people as tucutes and fakers and trying to get them chucked out of trans spaces because their understanding of GD isn't as refined as some people's. *Nice*.

> No, the transsexual community is welcoming to all transsexual men and women.

ehlersdanlos,ffq4v82,t1_ffpvsmn,1580120599.0,"""""""""Trenders"""""""" admitting they don't have gender dysphoria also usually have an incorrect idea of what gender dysphoria *is*. They often think it means ""disliking their genitals"". They don't realise for example that mild gender euphoria at being called different pronouns means *they have gender dysphoria*. Any ""trender"" who says ""I prefer to be called xe/xem"" or ""Don't call me a woman"" or feels happier and more themselves in a certain style of clothes, 9 times out of 10 *has gender dysphoria* even if they say ""I don't have gender dysphoria"". So this is making a lot of assumptions about people based on something they often don't understand tbh.

At the end of the day, it's like depression. You can meet the criteria for MDD, or you can be depressed. Someone who doesn't identify with their assigned gender at birth is trans, that's what being trans is. They may not get a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (NOTE: the diagnosis is not ""being trans"", last I checked ""Transgender"" was not the Dx), depending on whether they meet the criteria for gender dysphoria. But that doesn't change whether they're trans. Deciding that being trans requires gender dysphoria is a personal decision, not a medical one.

Changing your mind *has to be fine*. Most of the court and media battles right now are about the notion that we're forcing children to stick with an initial idea that they might be trans, and not let them change and grow and admit ""hey maybe I was wrong about that"". Exploring your gender identity, like your sexual identity, is a *process*, it's not black and white for everyone. To come down from on high and say ""your first decision is your last decision, end of story"" is brutally cruel and has nothing to do with whether someone is ""actually trans"".

Nor ""should"" being trans have to come with transition. Even amongst binary trans people, some people *just don't want to*. Whether it's social transition (maybe they don't want to for work reasons), or physical transition (maybe they aren't happy with where surgery is at the moment, maybe they just don't won't surgery at all). But when we bring non-binary people into the mix, expecting transition is a joke. Non-binary transition options are extremely limited and poor. Many people aren't happy with them.

Exploring your identity, or choosing not to transition, or being trans without meeting the medical criteria for one specific symptom of being trans, are not automatic signs that someone is ""co-opting"" or ""deliberately faking"".

OTOH you're making the trans community actively hostile for a large group of trans people. Which is pretty bad my friend. Dunno why you're surprised that people who do that sometimes end up getting banned, like, creating a hostile environment for your fellow trans folks is going to get you in hot water. This is like TERFs being mock surprised they're being thrown out of LGBT spaces for being TERFs."

NonBinary,ffenqxn,t1_ffdlrgo,1579856293.0,"Unfortunately a lot of my collection is inherited from a friend and quite old (and thus discontinued). The two scents I have in this kinda region, including the one I mentioned, are Singing Moon (one of the one-off lunar blends), and Dunwich. If it helps you find scent notes that work for you, here are their notes:

* Singing Moon: Moonlight over grave grass, meadowsweet, marsh hellebore, rock sea-lavender, Irish Lady's-tresses, melancholy thistle, and wood bitter-vetch, with the scent of autumn fires in the distance, sprayed by wind howling over the Atlantic.
* Dunwich: Dry, skeletal woods and moist marsh, dripping with the perfume of bog lilies.

They're very poetic about their notes but hopefully this helps you when looking at other perfumes on the site, or at the directory.

(Dunwich is a weird one in that it's a floral, sort of, you can smell the flowers in it, but this very woody, marshy quality to it makes it feel quite a masc/unisex floral, a poisonous and dangerous floral where the flowers are layered with heady fog.)

If you find the layout confusing (and hell, it kinda is, being ordered more by theme than scent), then if you have any idea of the kind of scents you like the directory is your best bet. It does list scents by the kind of thing they were going for with them as well (feminine, vampiric, soothing, seductive, joy), but that's going to be hit and miss. Picking by scent note is often better, although if it's a popular note the list can be long.
