socialskills,fhzzcrb,t3_f5ow47,1582018964.0,"I'd say it has to do with how comfortable you feel around other people once you become tipsy, in a sense that you start to have less worries and be less self-conscious which leads to more confidence. Confidence is key.
I'd say try bit by bit to get yourself out of your comfort-zone and get used to people youre comfortable with but also put yourself in social situations that you wouldn't have gone to otherwise i.e. start a conversation with a stranger, give compliments to a stranger. Slowly this should help you expand your comfort-zone thus becoming less shy and more outgoing (while sober)."

I feel this would change my body's chemistry (even even if for a short while) but would make me feel much better and more willing to do something with my day. Repeating this usually helps me a lot."

But i what I've been starting to notice (speaking mainly about Cairo) is that more and more people have become more independent of the societal norms which is a sign of emancipation not just for women but for all people."

TooAfraidToAsk,eyv1ayn,t1_evfqwqd,1567477747.0,"Too bad this whole situation is, in the end, all revolving about politics and borders rather than geography and demographics. The whole principle that entire droves of religiously unified people (in this case the Jewish Europeans) who either fled or have been sent by other countries (UK and other EU countries) to the so called ""deserved land"" makes absolutely no sense.
There were people living there, enjoying their own lives and having their own cultures, who were taken by surprise when the population shifted (minority becomes the majority) in less than a decade. Of course the palastinians felt threatened. It's not like Palastinians could just wander in another country e.g. italy and proclaim theyhave the right to live there because they have been mistreated by zionists in their own home (in contrast to the nazis and jews in EU)."

Sometimes in the moment you don't have the time to think, your body starts pumping more rapidly and as many others said, you are in a fight or flight moment caused by adrenaline spike.
Retrospectively, it probably would have been better for both parties if OP had ran but that doesn't change the fact that what OP did was justified self-defense."
