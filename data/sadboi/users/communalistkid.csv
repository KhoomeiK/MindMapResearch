You admit the trump administration is fascism, but can’t even be willing to vote for something that isn’t? Do you know how messed up that sounds? Voting for Biden isn’t the end of the conversation. It doesn’t mean we fold to him. We need to organize on other levels and expand our movement. We are being put in a shitty situation but we need to be pragmatic and put people’s comparable well-being first. The trump administration has really affected a lot of people. Again, just because you’re not affected doesn’t mean others aren’t. Agriculture is getting fucked, poor people are screwed, and hate crimes are higher than during the Obama administration.

They want to overturn roe v wade, they want LGBTQ+ people to not have the same freedoms, they want inner city communities to continue to be destitute, they want to continue to funnel government money into their own businesses and to add more federal judges that will continue the evangelical mission— how the fuck is that better? What kind of theory do you read? 

Honestly as a lesbian, as someone who grew up poor, as someone who deals with the antisemitism that trump has encouraged— fuck you. That entitled shit isn’t getting us anywhere. Bernie is backing the DNC because he KNOWS what a threat another 4 years of trump is. Think about the people who are going to be most affected by his policies.

Another 4 years of trump could mean fascism. Are you really okay with the KKK being able to mingle with our president? Do you not understand how fucked up that is?

They could do so much damage. Worse than Regan damage... billionaires weren’t really a thing back then, etc. wealth inequality is basically back to the 1920s, we have rolled back protections for the environment to insane degrees in the midst of a total climate collapse, etc. 

We are in a position that simply calls to vote for Biden, not because of his morals being good or because he deserves it, but because he is easier to lobby and will at least make attempts to implement some environmental protections and more. Does anyone really believe that the generation before us liked everything about the candidates they chose? If we cannot see the threat in front of us, we are truly idiots. 

Just because something doesn’t affect someone doesn’t mean it has no effect on others. Some leftists are straight up being brats and honestly that’s just armchair socialism. We need to vote for someone we can lobby, then really get to work on the ground to help elect leftists in smaller races— anything from city council to senate, to school boards, etc. We need to actually build a grassroots movement that changes things instead of sitting on our asses and complaining.

If someone were to actually try to make a logical argument about why pedophiles who don't harm others (as in act on their sexual urges) are terrible people I can guarantee there's no way it would work.

I think the podcast can be pretty interesting at times, but I don’t agree with them on lots of things and I wish people were more critical of them. I also don’t think people really know how to tell what of their stuff is a joke and what isn’t, and it becomes kind of an issue. I think it’s important to have comic relief as a leftist because, well, it’s fucking draining and it’s easy to become really depressed about it. However, I don’t think that jokes should ever become the whole of someone’s thoughts, as it becomes an issue with just being reactionary and unable to be critical/use any form of real argumentation. 

If you get into chapo, just balance it with other things. It’s important to keep an open mind and question shit. As a psychologist I just think it’s all a group polarization issue. I don’t think people recognize when they’re becoming too absorbed in things to the point that they can’t question anything.

LateStageFeudalism,fi51d3m,t1_fi4z2ug,1582152788.0,Oh boo hoo generalize it to liberal bullshit lol. Spin shit however you want. You can say toxic shit online but it’s not doing anything.
LateStageFeudalism,fi4xx2v,t1_fi4jffx,1582150688.0,"Firm adherence to a moral code or values. Core concept of leftism is that all people deserve equal treatment and capability to thrive.

Edit: just wanna add that you can obviously state this person’s opinion is egregious. It is. But saying someone should kill themselves is just fucking gross. How about just argue why this person is wrong without jumping to that? It seems extremely reactionary tbh"
cooperatives,fi4g5fi,t1_fi3whrd,1582140516.0,this was a great response hahah
LateStageFeudalism,fi4g26a,t1_fi3cgja,1582140464.0,I laughed out loud at this. It’s people like you who make the left look bad. Don’t say people should kill themselves. Have some fucking integrity man.

Edit: also bipolar and haven’t had to take meds in 2 years thanks to mindfulness and holistic health. I can literally get through my mood swings and mania/lows on my own now."

Jewish,fi2rh4y,t1_fi2re01,1582086984.0,It hurts a bit— but more or less depending on where you get it! My elbow hurt and so did my chest. I’m very skinny though so that may be why.
Judaism,fi2r7k7,t1_fi2r24w,1582086775.0,"I’m an American Jew (first-gen; mom from Poland) and I don’t act like this. I do think lots of Jews in my country are self-hating, though. I’m unsure why that is, however. While I think talking about these issues is fine, this is absolutely not the time and place."

askphilosophy,fi1mgu2,t3_f5tyln,1582060603.0,"Was going to try for a PhD in philosophy because I love it so much. My professors talked me out of it. Don’t become a philosopher. You’ll be stuck in academia (if you can even get a job— which is really unlikely) and won’t be able to have much time to really philosophize. If you want to continue reading it and being a part of it, do it on your own leisure time. I’ve spoken at a few philosophy conferences as an undergrad and I can tell you right now it isn’t what you think it’s like. No one comes, everyone is miserable. It’s not at all as glamorous as it once could’ve been. Don’t waste your time and money on the formal education outside of taking undergrad classes."
