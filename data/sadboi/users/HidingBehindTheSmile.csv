You were terrified and didnt share any if it.  So when you told him..sorry when you demanded the nurse to get him out you KNEW what that was going to do to him.  You're upset that he is taking this way more to heart than you expected. You figured he'd be a bit mad but get over it quickly.  You were wrong.  You clearly broke his heart and it seems, from how you described what happened, that you acted in a way that he never expected you to.

Couples therapy is not a magic wand that can fix everything.  The fact someone even wants to attend couples therapy shows they want to fix the marriage.  The fact he doesnt want to shows that currently he has no interest in trying to fix this relationship.  

You forced him out of one room.  The room he wanted to be in more than anything in his life.  So now it sounds like you're looking for some magic words that will fix this situation you created but there arent any.  Time may fix this but you cant force it no matter how hard you try.  Saying it has been two weeks says to me that you feel he should be better now.  Well he isn't and that's his choice.

I used to have an incredible memory and could fully recall conversations. 

 I found it really hard when my friends were talking about some event they went to and it turned out I went with them.  I have no recollection of it.  No planning of it or anything. 

Even now sometimes if something is brought up I'll check with my wife to see if that's what really happened and if I was there etc."

I had to say goodbye to one of my dogs 2 years ago and then my other dog last year.  My heart still aches for them.  My wife bought me them to help me get out of the house when I was very ill.  They saved my life."

There was this one time, a few weeks ago.  I was walking in the park, and I saw two guys kissing.  That was the gayest thing I'd seen until I read this.

Holy shit he's 26!?!!?"

You mentioned in another comment that you want to leave for a while.  It sounds like that would be a good idea and right for you and your son.  That's who is important, not this childish moron.  I'm a father myself and I'm in no way perfect but his reaction makes me sick to my stomach.  Shame on him."

There needs to be a few drunk, a couple fighting, a few of them should be asleep and there needs to be at least 2 with body odour so bad you can see it.  Oh and at least 1 incredibly old person who catches the bus in the middle of rush hour and  who takes an hour to get up and down the bus."
