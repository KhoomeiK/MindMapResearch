I work as a private duty nurse. I was leaving my patient‚Äôs home which was in the middle of nowhere in very rural Tennessee. Like dirt roads, no civilization for miles.

AskReddit,fove05w,t3_g9kd5x,1588099734.0,"I am a lucid dreamer. In the last few years it‚Äôs not every night like it used to be, but at least once or twice a week I can do whatever I want. I have never been limited in my dream world. I have flown, had telepathic powers, made anyone I wish to see or talk to appear, changed genders, anything and everything I can imagine. 

But it comes at a price. 

Not only can I control everything and see it all as clearly as it is in the waking world, all my other senses work fine too. I can smell, taste, feel, hear everything. All the good.... and all the bad. And sometimes my lucidity is great but half the time, while I can control almost everything, sometimes the world around me has a mind of its own. I can control my reactions and make some fantastic things happen. But I cannot control the landscape or who or what shows up. And during these dreams the world is always horrifying. Death, decay, the most perverse and terrifying things you could imagine. And I can sense ALL of it. I have awakened violently retching from awful smells. Or crying in pain from being stabbed, still able to smell all the blood and sharp sweat. Or sometimes with screams and other awful sounds in my ears. 

Lucid dreaming is awesome. And horrible. And it was fun for a while as a kid. But now I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not every single night. Because I remember all of them. It‚Äôs like a real place I go to. Certain landmarks have always been the same. Certain people or creatures are the same. I remember them. And sometimes they remember me."
