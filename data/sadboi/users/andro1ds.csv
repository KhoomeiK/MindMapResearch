All the same - high ideals about others treating you as you would them may also be softened over time - by this I mean that people are people and are not all made of the same stuff and they do let each other down at times.

AmItheAsshole,fq0j8le,t3_gg6z20,1589032706.0,"NTA he crossed a massive line - sucks. Sorry you had to first hand witness how some guys think they are ‘nice guys’ who can be creepy to people who have their trust. There were a lot better ways he could have made his interests known however if you are not interested in him after these 10 yrs that would prob still have made you feel ambushed.

Question is, what’s he worth to you? Is he a creep, really your friend after this, something more or none of the above.

Asking cos I once had a best friend for 8 years jump me when I was asleep - he got very pissed off when I woke up with him groping me and wasn’t happy. It was before I realised how bad that shit was. We ‘made up’ and went on as before, in turn he got possessive and very upset when I about a year later hooked up with his step brother. I had no clue he wasn’t over me and really he was a complete dick coining that term ‘self entitled nice guy’ before it was a thing. Neither of of us couldn’t continue our friendship after that prob for the best. 

In retrospect that first ‘trying it on with me when I was asleep’ should have been my key to he just might not be my friend 🤷🏻‍♀️ is this one yours?

I hope you find out but you are defo NTA"
AmItheAsshole,fpt2zpd,t3_gf6x2a,1588883970.0,"NTA IN CAPS, holy hell!!!!

Was this how he behaved pre pregnancy or has he had a change of personality?

Regardless, He could not be more wrong! Resent anyone, resent him. You cannot complete this pregnancy off-meds AND be a mum after birth if you go off your meds (against docs advise).your SO isn’t an obstetrician, a midwife, a pharmacologist or a psychiatrist so he does not know a goddamn first thing about what is best for the baby. Him being a dick to you is very unhealthy for both you and the baby!

Healthy mum, healthy baby! 

Omg HTA He really sounds like a piece of work. Do you have anyone who can support you through this that isn’t him? He does not sound healthy for you!

And I should know! About staying on meds, i mean, I just went through a pregnancy (adhd, ocd, anxiety, chronic pain, sensatiory disorder, ptsd) and my husband and I went into it saying that we could only go through with it if I could stay on my meds. I did and it was by he best decision ever! 

I didn’t the first time we had a baby and it went so fucking wrong resulting in me being hospitalised and my daughter being deprived of a mum for almost a year. 

...SO EVEN IF you were to think of your child first and not you, staying on your meds would be the right thing to do. Is what I’m trying to say.

your husband has to suck it up, you need to be a team and you need to be ok through a topsy turvy hormone roller coaster, your body changing and all that jazz. And you will be. But you ARE number one plain and simple

Looking back there is resentment and anger towards care takers for not protecting and loving me that way they were supposed to. It’s an adult feeling a child’s feelings of incomprehensibility though.

As an adult there is adult anger towards the doctors that gave me the wrong diagnosis and reacted with scorn when I brought new symptoms as a reaction to wrong meds to his attention - later another doctor diagnosed me on the basis of those symptoms and I’d learned not to question pdocs.

10 years of over-medication and wrong diagnosis and resentment towards the docs I begged to help me out of the horrid circle - it ended with closed ward for 9 months and A LOT electro convulsive therapy. All because of that fucking first doctor and his wrong diagnosis and the docs that followed who didn’t question or took tome to look at all the things that didn’t make sense.

Years of my children’s childhood I can’t remember and I was so fuck of anxiety and pocd (a form of ocd where you are so afraid that you might be a pedi file and hurt your kids but you aren’t and you don’t know) that I was barely a person!

Eventually I found a doc which helped me titrage out of the meds. It took 2 years. And diagnosed me with adhd.

No bipolar disorder. No personality disorder. No psychosis. No pocd, no intrusive thoughts. No real anxiety. No eating disorder. But instead adhd and ptsd from the many years of crisis and now I’m so worn that I am in physical pain and I can’t work.

I’ve tried to complain and sue those doctors but it’s the word of a - then - crazy person against the doctors and they all protect each Other! I down even want compensation, just a ‘fuck! I’m so sorry, I was wrong’ will do: I won’t get it but I’ve tried for 4 years and hopefully I’ve gives them cause to pause and think so they no one else will experience thus at their hands.

That’s there’s anger towards my partner through 20 years who let me down by cheating on me.

But I refuse to be a victim. I relapse but I’m doing better. Though I struggle with trusting, well anyone....

I need to move on from the victim status. I’m not sure I know how."

I’ve been cheated on. But I’ve also later accused a non-cheater of cheating and I crossed some boundaries I shouldn’t have. How can we know which is which here if either. We can’t. We can’t say ‘dude that’s totally justified’ imho. That’s all I’m saying."

AmItheAsshole,folco3i,t3_g7swpo,1587859410.0,"YTA, yes. On an overall the right thing to do and u understanding your husband and talking to him about what is going through scale. 

But ‘the right thing’ isn’t  the best thing to do here if it’s not the best for your family as a unit. sometimes it’s ok to be an asshole, I have to be one to protect my family too at times - I have several chronic illnesses that means I can’t handle what others can and that limits us all time and again when we say no to things that others dont. 

But my point is - it’s legit to not want it, or be able to handle it and so on. And if watching out for your kids is your legit reason maybe that’s ok. And....make sure he is primary care giver too

But it does suck for his sister! And your husband. And that’s a trade off you have to live with! I really dont mean that in s shitty way.

Also remember that disabled people at also that, people, and lack of speech doesn’t mean there isn’t a person to get to know. Your husbands closest family and your kids aunt. There May ne Stuff to be gained here. Depending on the person that tour DIL is and how much she interacts when you know her Well.

Me, I genuinely wouldn’t be able to handle it for health reasons but I’d been so very shitty about it because of my sister in-laws potential lack of life, my husbands feelings, depriving my kids of a proper relationship with their aunt that I’d prob do it."
Infidelity,folb65c,t1_fojw929,1587858532.0,"It’s fine to say I won’t stand for your behaviour’ but if my partner demanded to see my phone and went through my messages with my friends I’d cause real serious issues about boundaries and respect on my end. Then, I don’t have anything to hide...."
Infidelity,folaonb,t3_g7v21y,1587858243.0,"Well dude... I don’t know, this is super unhealthy! I mean firstly. 

You may have reasons to believe that she is cheating, but that does not give you any right to behave possessive and controlling. You do not behave that way. If you feel that she is not behaving respectful or loving within your relationship you talk to her like an adult pier and if that does not work you can stay or go but you not possess her. 

Also 24 yer olds are at different stages in life than 18yr olds. 

And so much other not healthy stuff described here. Her Behaviour. Your perspective of her and her behaviour, and definitely also your behaviour - is all just bad news. If she treats you poorly, find you if you’d stay even if she isn’t cheating. That’s up to you, but If she isn’t cheating and you want to stay, I’d find a much better way to go about the whole thing too"
beyondthebump,fol9otq,t1_fokjv2b,1587857665.0,But those exercices...am I the only one that feels frisky when I do them 🤔 really distracting and inconvenient at times 😅
beyondthebump,fol9fwi,t3_g7wl16,1587857520.0,"Congrats and Thanks 😊 but honestly I don’t particularly want it back 🤷🏻‍♀️ I mean, i felt the same as you do after my 1st baby, and I was so happy and proud when i was back to normal and fit. But I starved myself at times and hated myself and over exercised and that’s not healthy! (Only talking about myself here)

I knew going I to this one that I wouldn’t bounce back to the way I looked before and I was fine with it. So I don’t expect it back. It’s my 2nd baby and I’m 43 and I’ve earned my sz large through a hellish pregnancy and most difficult post part I’m and I deserve some down town time on the self hate I get into when I allow myself to feel inferior because I’m not skinny anymore. I want to love my post partum body and praise it and myself for what it went through to make my kids - wasn’t easy - and if my husband doesn’t love me and it for that and for me, the door is there and he’s not worth it. I love him for him I’m his dad bod too.

Doesn’t mean I’m not going to (live healthy, just mean I’m not going to kill myself to go size M or hate myself for not doing it either.)"

baldursgate,fol4222,t1_fokefl2,1587854471.0,"The EE sometimes will let you choose but I noticed that Yeslick didn’t let me, he was levelled up by game when I picked him up at lvl 7 (had done Durlag’s early so was hugger up than Per usual)"
baldursgate,fol3nqu,t1_fokexi0,1587854244.0,Will give it s whirl ☺️
baldursgate,fokbbzk,t1_fok1yxk,1587838880.0,Brilliant! I’ve played this for soooo many years and have never done that! I’ve already cleared out Durlag’s tower but think there are basilisks In Beregost west too. Will defo try! ☺️ cheers
baldursgate,fokax59,t1_fok4nbe,1587838661.0,Bring them on! That’s what the post is about ☺️ I have done other ways in other play throughs - this one was new to me and fairly effortless at that
baldursgate,fokamia,t1_fok7tdw,1587838502.0,I’ve played a lot of different styles - I try to take chosen alignment and role play - ps4 won’t let you cheat/clua/shadowkeeper so the xp farming comes in handy for companions that were picked up too early but have attributes or quests I want ☺️
baldursgate,fok8lqa,t1_fok581o,1587837428.0,"I do it - in this play through - to draw out the game and experience all the players some I picked up early and get the inclination to develop later for particular skills or jobs.  I’ve played it for 20 yrs on pc and have used every keeper option and mod but this time I’m doing a pure vanilla core rules play through on the PS4 and none of that is available here. And that’s a good thing as all that kinda dumbs the game down.

Sure on pc you can just fill your coffers and edit saves to have all the exp and weapons and alignment you want, and remove experience cap and so on, and I’ve done that but this time experience farming let’s me experience all 30+ companions.

I’m enjoying doing it this way, this time ☺️"
baldursgate,fok7r4c,t1_fojw5sr,1587836972.0,"Yep - I have done that on many a play through but that’s all well and good on pc, but I’m a completist so doing all the npc quests and it’s vanilla on the PS4 this time - actually fun to do a vanilla no cheating/clua/shadow keeper options"
baldursgate,fok7jq1,t1_fok0zfb,1587836862.0,Great tip! Cheers. I actually remember doing that on an earlier play through
baldursgate,fok7g0p,t1_fok2ubb,1587836806.0,"Haha no, but i dis type it with a baby on my arm and a 7 year Old climbing on me ☺️ bloody lockdown! No time to myself at all..."
baldursgate,foju5j9,t1_fohw6ua,1587829449.0,"The wyvern Cave in cloakwood is my go-to when I have to level a npc I picked up too early - bring a stack off antidotes, said npc and a cleric that waits where booted (I bring vic). Boot her out of party, Then sleep, kill wyvern, 1400 exp. rinse and repeat. Invite Vic/cleric back into party, heal, boot her, sleep, kill, rinse and repeat. 

Smash those levels up (and vs da also, if you are playing core rules - up to you but Aube click the ‘max jo er level up’ or you may end with a lv 7 Rasaad with 28 hp 😂)"
ADHD,foj47er,t1_fohl0mg,1587807703.0,"Yeah it semi does for me to eventually but it ends up very long because I can think of sooooo much I need to do and haven’t and then it’s hard to start it.

There is a system where you mark/ sort the list into ‘need’ and ‘nice’ and then label the need one after time sensitivity.
And it’s great. BUT my brain wants to do the ‘nice’ list and that’s how it works"
ADHD,foj42gx,t1_foh8cil,1587807548.0,"I know! I mean I know I’m better if I have a sort of routine and some structure but it’s sooooo demanding. And the adhd therapist that gives me photo copies 6am-12pm schedules and starts every session asking me how that went and all I have is a semi filled in one from the very first session. 

Filling it out inevitably ends with me painting a dresser or sorting my kids Lego drawer 🤷🏻‍♀️"
