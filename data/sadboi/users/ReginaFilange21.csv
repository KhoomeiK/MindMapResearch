Rosacea,fp27zt9,t1_fp1hc0d,1588256955.0,"I was just like you, barely had any actual skin care routine other than using dove beauty bar and whatever moisturizer my mom had lying around and never even had pimples growing up. A little under two years ago I started showing signs of rosacea and it looked very similar to yours when I’d have flair ups. 

I tried prescription metro cream and azeliac acid but I’d still have flair ups all the time especially if I was stressed, which would make me more stressed. The azeliac acid helped at first but ended up drying my skin out way too much so I decided to take a break from everything and switched to washing with neutrogena ultra gentle daily face cleanser for sensitive skin (rinsing with cool water only) and applying a good amount of aveeno ultra calming nourishing night cream after, in the morning and night. I tried to use the day version in the morning but the night one works better for me for both daily applications. 

It’s been two months and my skin has never been so clear. I have maybe had two flare ups during the last two months, when I used to get them every day and both times were after drinking red wine the night before. My family and boyfriend have both noticed a difference, and my cheeks don’t hurt anymore.

I could be lucky, or it could be a combination of not working (I’m a server and bartender so I’ve been laid off during the pandemic) but my stress has honestly just shifted from work to this situation, I have bad anxiety so I don’t think avoiding stress is truly an option for me. I’ve cut back a ton on drinking which has helped too, and the weather isn’t as cold lately so it could be a combination of many factors but maybe try those products/similar ones and take a break from the harsher stuff and see if it helps? 

Here’s a link to both products I use, they aren’t super expensive but the moisturizer is a bit pricey for the amount I get considering I use a decent amount every application.

curlyhair,fn0zoqq,t3_fyodhq,1586551892.0,"Routine: 
Co-wash with tresemme pro pure light moisture conditioner, rinse and condition with the same. Leave in while I do my other shower stuff then rinse about 90% of it out with cool water. Wrap in a microfiber towel so it’s not dripping wet, then apply a small scoop of Cantu Shea butter leave in conditioning repair cream, upside down using the rake method to de-tangle and distribute evenly root to tip. Scrunch in a handful of deva curl arc angel gel, plopped in a t shirt for 20 mins. Diffused  with my new Infiniti pro conair hairdryer in chunks on low speed, warm setting with hair flipped upside down and using the “cool” button on each chunk after about 20 seconds. This is it about 90% dry, gunna wait till it’s done and then scrunch out the crunch with a bit of organics extra virgin raw coconut oil. 

Can’t believe the volume around my roots! This is the best curly day I’ve had since I started and I’m so glad I decided to try out diffusing, as my hair is super thick and takes 8 ish hours to air dry and ends up a bit frizzy cause it’s impossible not to touch it for that long.

My goals now are more definition, but to be fair when everything in my city locked down and I got laid off, I cut my own hair (about 4”) and started doing CG cause I figured there’s no better time than now when I’m not working and having to put my hair up every day or going out much so I’m not having to worry about bad hair days or tempted to use my flat iron. When everything opens up again I’m going to get a deva cut for sure, which I’m hoping will help with definition and a more even hairdo especially around the tips."

AskReddit,fbzxheg,t1_fbzx9kl,1577266982.0,Don’t go to a sit down restaurant with table service and get annoyed at the fact that you have a server...

The line does great work, busting ass 110% and LETS BE REAL servers are the ones that have to take the brunt of the backlash. I love the BOH where I work, I’m sure the servers you work with absolutely view you as a delight! 

I love cooking, it’s my passion. I have nothing but the utmost respect for people that make it a career and the drive and motivation cooks have is what made me fall in love with my boyfriend who works the line every day of the week...but to view your foh that way? I’d love to see you wait tables. Oh lord"

AskReddit,fbzx22c,t1_fbzwx7f,1577266296.0,"Learn how to cook! Problem solved. Don’t be an asshole and expect top notch service, we’re serving you because you chose to go to a restaurant like do you have any self awareness?"
AskReddit,fbzwz12,t1_fbzwr24,1577266161.0,"Different countries have different social norms. Servers in America get paid less than $5/hour, complaining about tipping and stiffing your server to stick it to the man just makes you an asshole. I’m fine making $25+ an hour waiting tables, cause I’m a good server. If your server is terrible, yeah maybe don’t tip 20+% but sometimes the cashier at the grocery store is rude or the salesman at the mall isn’t attentive enough or your bank fucks you over or some shitty doctor gives a wrong diagnosis. You don’t refuse to pay for those services because of it, if you prefer to seat, serve and bus your own table go get some fast food. NO one is perfect, and no one deserves to be screwed over. If you go out to eat in the US, not tipping is a shitty thing to do."

How miserable do you have to be to complain and call servers “insects” after you CHOSE to go to a restaurant to be served and waited on? It’s legitimately the job of a server.... to serve their tables...
AskReddit,fbzwfz4,t1_fbzvu50,1577265302.0,On paper it sounds messed up but any server that’s good at what they do would prefer living on tips than min wage.
AskReddit,fbzwcn0,t1_fbzvjdk,1577265152.0,"We provide better service because our income depends on it. I work at a lower/mid scale restaurant 20ish hours a week and average between $20-$30 an hour, some nights when I bartend it’s about $40 an hour that I take home in cash at the end of my shift. It’s unreliable and the hours aren’t ideal but there’s a lot of perks like a fun environment, flexible schedules (you would have no problem choosing to work week day lunches, easy and 10-3 shift at most places but the $$$ is night shifts, especially weekends) and if you can throw your game face on you build relationships with regulars that will ALWAYS take care of you, not just with big tips but the personal connection is so rewarding."
TooAfraidToAsk,fbyv7co,t1_fbyt13k,1577227217.0,"For example, some very old/very sick person who doesn’t have any family or loved ones, or is a terrible person (mistreating the nurses/doctors, or just generally being a piece of shit) is dying on a table and you know if they die their organs will go to a baby or child in need whose parents have been sitting in NICU/ICU/cancer ward for months or years praying their child gets a successful transplant...

Not saying I’d let them die, I’m not a doctor but I could understand the intrusive thoughts they may have in a situation like that one."

You don’t have to go out of your way to comment on their shit on social media telling them every time they post a selfie. When guys I know have girlfriends do that, it’s just gross honestly. We’re all allowed to feel how we feel about it, I personally wouldn’t want to be with someone who would even bother commenting “beautiful” and stuff on other girls selfies, to me it’s just disrespectful"

His roof had been deteriorating and was legit caving in until some people he knew, out of the kindness of their hearts, fixed it for him. My aunt works around the clock to pay the bills, he can’t leave the house anymore. This is a couple that has worked/lived for their entire lives in normal job fields, like he was a mechanic and coached high school sports on the side for decades until he got so sick he couldn’t work anymore, in a small New England town. It fucking kills me."
YouShouldKnow,fa87kyb,t1_fa80x9i,1575842279.0,"It’s a for-profit system. Private insurance makes a ton of money from people paying it that rarely/never have to use it, and hospitals make a ton of money charging insane prices that insurance will have to shell out, but not everything is “covered” and insurance will fine loop holes where they can to avoid covering things. It’s absolutely fucked, I’m 24 and luckily am still on my moms insurance but the number of people I know with no insurance at all is SCARY, almost as scary as the people I know who have insurance and are in devastating debt from medical bills due to serious illnesses, in some cases terminal illnesses, and that debt will be passed to their families when they leave us."

So my Virginia tobacco pods are fine, and I can still buy a pack of Marlboro reds but absolutely nothing flavored, including menthol. I’d rather them be upfront about what the fuck the angle is, cause it’s clearly not at ALL about “public health”."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,f9j0eox,t1_f9izv4m,1575351349.0,"MA. It happened overnight, no warning. Pretty much every single small vape shop got fucked over, tons have gone out of business due to a “public health emergency” cause of teenagers ordering vitamin e filled carts on the black market. MA also just banned all flavored tobacco products, so menthol cigarettes will be banned as of this coming June.

It’s hilarious cause every store has signs up saying “we no longer sell vaping products due to a public health crisis” RIGHT next to rows and rows of regular cigarettes. At least we have a safe, healthy alternative, right?"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,f9izk0f,t1_f9isiyd,1575350536.0,"The only thing that’s helped me cut back has been switching to a juul. Unfortunately, my state banned all vape products in September. I drive to NH now, 30 min drive every couple weeks is SO worth it compared to going back to smoking cigarettes regularly. I only smoke butts now after a long shift at work or every couple weeks if I’m out with my friends drinking I’ll have a few, and I give away a good chunk of the packs I buy to people asking to bum one at work/at the bar etc."

KidsAreFuckingStupid,f9ir9v4,t1_f9ik98u,1575344076.0,"It’s honestly kinda heartbreaking. I started smoking at 15, legit no excuse other than being stupid as hell and going through a rebellious phase, and quitting was/is the hardest thing ever. My dads whole side of the family smoked, I lost my grandfather, aunt and am about to lose my uncle to smoking related illness. It isn’t something you can just quit when you realize it’s bad for you..not trying to make excuses but once you pick it up, your body physically craves it so bad that if you don’t have strong enough willpower you will always find a reason to justify it, and I say that as someone who has been trying to quit for a year now and am finally down to one pack a month. It’s an addiction, and nicotine has been so normalized that even though people KNOW the risks it’s easy to justify it in your mind, myself included."
