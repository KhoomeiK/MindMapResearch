depression,foe8rq3,t1_focnpoh,1587698352.0,In the exact same boat here. It sucks when you try to turn to friends for help and they just ignore you or gloss over it since you appear to be doing well.

depression,fm9in1x,t3_ftoulw,1585869506.0,"Existence is shit, and there are some days when you just can't move you're paralysed by it, and you truly cannot be fucked with anything. But if you manage to pick yourself up and ride that shitty wave there are some things that can help. Volunteering really helped me. It's sad because you see some things and you think wow life is fucking horrible to people but if you can make even a tiny difference and create some happiness for someone else it might be worth it. I'm currently volunteering and fostering for the SPCA and meeting people who truly love animals and are giving them good homes helps to give me purpose."
depression,fhrxamm,t3_f4fhox,1581843102.0,Honestly OP you need some new friends. Good and supportive people do exist out there and you deserve to feel love.

minimalism,f7c6mfg,t1_f7axifj,1573585557.0,"Hey OP I saw a post before on how someone donated their art supplies to the local school and personal products to the women's shelter etc. Depression fucking sucks I know and having something that can make you feel happy even if only for a bit I think holds a lot of worth. Just think, all the hobby things you have bought can definitely have a new home with someone who will really appreciate them! I adopted a 4 yr old cat recently and although I had to buy a lot of things to keep him happy he gives me so much purpose and happiness in life. Good luck OP üòä"

Definitely second the above comment with the mason jar. I put mine in a glass jar with a silicone seal around the lid, stayed in really good condition, keep out of light but away from moisture."
