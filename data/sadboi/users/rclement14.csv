CasualConversation,fr0dn68,t3_glvzbh,1589791891.0,Awesome...congratulations!
dirtyr4r,fqz7mou,t3_gli374,1589761571.0,"Would like to chat, hoping to hear from you..."
lonely,fqs36iz,t1_fqrzkcc,1589597476.0,Thanks for that. I'm doing my best and appreciate your comments
lonely,fqqvtxh,t3_gkaaqk,1589572869.0,"As someone who has struggled mightily with mental health the last few years, thank you. That's incredibly kind and compassionate"
depression,faexxrv,t3_e8w18w,1576010461.0,"Welcome to the wonderful world of major depressive disorder! Seems like you have some experience with mental diseases and a pretty good support system. That's a start. I would reccomend you strengthen your support system by joining peer support groups, such as NAMI or DBSA. As you probably already know, no one understands depression better then those who suffer from it. I find it extremely helpful to talk with other people going through similar struggles. And as silly as it sounds, take one day at a time. One hour at a time if necessary. It's a long road and more likely then not, things won't be solved overnight. I wish you luck and if I can help, let me know"
depression,f92g6l9,t3_e3avf3,1575029626.0,"Glad you didn't give in to temptation. Been in your shoes and know exactly how badly you want relief. Please, hold on. Put one foot in front of the other and live. Maybe its shitty now. My life is also a figment of what it once was and I mourn what I lost. But, I keep going. Hope against hope that things will improve, even slightly. Know your not alone and I hope you will reach out if you need help...."
depression,f6v1cki,t3_dt5idb,1573173999.0,"You have an amazing talent at writing. Sadly, the description and detail is only too familiar. But the way your able to put it into words is incredible. Maybe you could try and write a little about what you'd like your life to be like..."
depression,f6v07c6,t3_dt5idb,1573173135.0,Society had shamed us into feeling alone and it's a very hard thing. Make sure you have a good support system. Here if you need to vent.
depression,f6uxkif,t3_dt5idb,1573171187.0,"Wow. Hoping you can push on, one day at a time, one hour at a time, one minute at a time if need be. Depression is a killer, literally. Wishing you better days"
depression,f6uuh7b,t3_dt5kwx,1573168999.0,"I can relate to you story in its entirety. I have had some type of depression or another since I was 16. However, my life took a drastic turn three years ago. Had three attempts and three hospitalizations in three months. Had ECT. Counseling, psychotherapy and all that. When the dust settled, the old me was no more. Sure, there are times when I may seem like my old self but in reality, I am changed. Just as you say you are. I am only speaking from my experience but I would guess that you suffered some trauma because of you attempt and may have triggered whatever the heck it is that causes depression. No one actually knows how depression begins or ends. In my mind, mental illness is misunderstood and medication is a crap shoot. I think maybe you have some other type if depression other then situational. Maybe you could have a neurosypche test done to determine what is going on?"
depression,f6utdv7,t3_dt5kx8,1573168235.0,"Nothing wrong with living at home. Hell, the cost of rent these days is going to force a lot more people to do just that. I'm sorry that your parents aren't very supportive. This illness is difficult in and of itself but you definitely need some supports to help get you through. Honestly, I wish you the best. Here for you if you need to talk. Keep your head up. You have a long life ahead of you which I hope is full of happiness and not more pain. One day at a time, one hour at a time if need be....."
depression,f6usx6x,t3_dt5lds,1573167919.0,You are not. Your illness is telling you that. YRA. You are amazing
depression,f6usutp,t3_dt5ngx,1573167879.0,"First off, there is nothing ""wrong"" with you. You have an illness, just like cancer or diabetes. In fact, your illness is more deadly then any other. It controls your thoughts and your actions and you ability to function. I'm sorry your having a tough time. I am too. I'm lucky that I have a support group near me that I attend once a week and can meet with people going through the same things I am. Its extremely helpful because, as you know, unless you've been through it, you can't possibly understand. I hope things get better for you..."
depression,f6uqdzm,t3_dt5ow5,1573166507.0,It is a big pill to swallow. I am still struggling to admit it will never leave my side. Always thought it was something I could beat but the realization that it's part of who I am has really taken a toll. I understand you completely
depression,f6gamvg,t3_dr5gz7,1572823738.0,Most important thing! You can't give from an empty well....hope your doing better!
depression,f5z88mb,t1_f5z7neu,1572569833.0,Happy to help.
depression,f5z7gz9,t3_dpww1y,1572569236.0,"The best thing you can do is be there for her. Talk to her, listen to her and just show her you care. If she has a trauma history, she may need a counselor and possibly a psychologist. The most important thing, in my opinion, is to put some time between her suicidal thoughts and her being alone. Most often, the feelings will lessen over time. So help her stay busy and occupied. Lastly, as a last alternative, there is inpatient care. You could take her to a hospital and talk to a crisis team....I wish you luck and am here to help any way I can. Been down that road, still on it myself..."
depression,f5x7ueh,t3_dpl4bu,1572536733.0,"The amazing thing about a post like yours is it opens the door for others to tell their stories. The stigmatization of our illness has shamed us into feeling like we have to wear the mask. I also wear a mask and most people I am around would never know the other side. I joined a DBSA support group in my area and it's probably the best thing I ever did in regards to coming to terms with who I am and what I'm going through. Like this post, there is a collection of people who actually UNDERSTAND! And in some small way, that helps. It doesn't make it all better or make it any less crushing but it somehow creates the feeling of being somewhat less hopeless. How amazing would it be if this post turned into some kind of support group where we could all help each other through our dark days? I would join in a heartbeat!"
