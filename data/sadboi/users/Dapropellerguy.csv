MechanicAdvice,flmn01x,t1_flml86w,1585288790.0,"That was a mistake in the title, I dont know how to change it but I meant crank no start. But I solved the problem by looking into the security system/key as you said and found a reply on a forum post that said you could reset the security system by locking and unlocking the tailgate with the key. In the same post another suggested they got it running by just cranking on it for 30 seconds until it started.

So I locked and unlocked the tailgate and kept cranking and voila it started running, just got back from driving it down the street and back.

If anyone can change the title I would appreciate it."
MechanicAdvice,flmkyjc,t1_flmk0r4,1585286804.0,"There is crank just does not start.

What connections should I be checking? and how do I check the security/key? I don't have any light indicators for it but I do know it has an alarm. Will the fact that not all of my electronic door locks work cause me to not be able to troubleshoot it?"

The most difficult part was letting loose my social anxiety, I felt I was in the throes of a panic attack but somehow maintained. Shook a lot of hands, acknowledged by many and welcomed. Felt wonderful."

depression,fd6tquh,t3_ek3uky,1578195597.0,"I had a friend who did that to me with my ex (was current gf at the time.) Long story short there was a divide between us and our other best friend (girls started entering our lives, and the friendships started to splinter) I invited him over to spend the night and hang out with us since she could only come over weekends. I went to work that night and left them in my house. My siblings picked up on something odd and I came home to see her with a content look and him barely even able to look at me.

It wasn't until a year later that I found out that they had sex in my bed when I was at work, when the aforementioned exiled friends re entered the chat. I didn't talk to him for a long while but for some reason we eventually rekindled our friendship and I have to say it was cool for a bit of time.

Again, drifts happened and now he's in prison for another 14+ years for fondling an 8 year old boy. 

Life can be a whirlwind.

The point is, in all these instances I lacked the balls to cut them out. Afforded them chances only to see them fall into a huge hole. But well, learning if anything."

AskReddit,f1r2j77,t3_dafj6x,1569710261.0,"I had what I can only describe as a panic seizure when the brake system on my car failed and I ran through an intersection causing a 3 vehicle accident. Luckily nobody was injured, when I came to I had people banging on my window because whilst seizing I had my foot planted in the accelerator and was smoking my tires.

Medical personnel showed up and checked me out, and I could have sworn they suggested I go to the hospital to get more tests done. I didn't. 3 years later without one word of potential consequences I get pulled over for a burnt out headlight. Turns out I was REQUIRED to get a follow up and since I didn't they cancelled my license.

Nearly a year in and out of court, medical exams, and having to take a new road test I finally have a legal license with no seizures ever since (7 years now.) Only problem is every time my license comes up for renewal I have to get an ok from a doctor that I haven't had seizures."

Best friend A wont get out of prison for at least another 15 years, and best friend B is still drifted apart with sparse contact but not even close to dire straits as A finds himself. Just how it is getting older, other than the prison aspect which is still a sensitive topic..."
