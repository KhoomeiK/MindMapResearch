First off, you are a really good person—just assessing the situation logically with morals and removing emotions. I suggest that you sit your daughter down and explain to her the logistics of the situation and that it was **her** initial request to have the boy move in and this is a great real-life lesson that actions have (often unpleasant) consequences and you have to learn to take responsibility for your prior choices, regardless of the outcome. 

You aren’t going to kick that boy out during a mandated quarantine—that’s just cruel and I think you know that. I am 26F saying this: your wife and daughter are operating solely on emotions (subjective egos)—I know they are able to rationalize and justify their feelings in a way that sounds just for them—everyone is very well acquainted with this type of rationale; my engineer of a Dad (who raised me by himself) beat into me the ability to approach situations objectively with respective logistics to all parties involved and weigh possible rewards against  possible consequences when confronting a dilemma. I’m under the impression that a decent portion of women (especially younger girls) lack the ability to forfeit emotional justification. 

This entire situation is something your daughter didn’t consider when she asked you if boyfriend could move in. If your daughter failed to consider the possibility of breaking up during quarantine while living together as a plausible scenario—she shouldn’t of asked for him to move him in the first place, especially without a back-up plan.

No, this was her complete doing and she needs to see it through—by either figuring out a housing arrangement for the poor boy or shoving her feelings and tolerating his *invited* presence.  You can’t offer a helping hand and then snap it back when it’s inconvenient. 

Boyfriend doesn’t deserve to endure the repercussions of your daughter’s flawed strategizing and poor adaptability potential."

He’s not a bad person, he’s just insecure—I got that impression when I started reading—initially trying to be supportive but feeling a type of way when you actually succeed, him trying to mitigate your accomplishments, trying to bring you down to his level with junk food. 

What really solidified it for me to assume that it’s his insecurities was him claiming that you’re using the time to exercise as an excuse to spend less time with him. I can feel his pain just through his reasoning—I think he loves you a lot and feels like he’s losing you through these new changes and doesn’t know how to express it correctly so he’s compensating with anger.

These two racist morons represent their schools and their school district since they applied and were accepted as part of the student body. The school district understandably doesn’t want people who act like this to be a part of their alumni. 

Stop crying ‘government’ whenever somebody is forced to take responsibility for their actions.

Again, freedom of speech =/= freedom from consequences. 

The government isn’t punishing them, the school is. The school is not the government which is why these students can’t say anything they want.

It’s disappointing that you don’t know the difference between rules when representing privileged establishments and your rights under the American government. Two different things, buddy."

Please stop making excuses for them. The only people responsible for making a racist tik tok are these two individuals. Society did not make them. Their under developed brains didn’t make them. They did. They are 18 years old decided to do something stupid. That’s it. At 18 I was applying for colleges, I wasn’t being racist for laughs."
