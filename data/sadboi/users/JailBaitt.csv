My roommate and I work at TJs and got our “bonus” it was chump change for what we have been dealing with. We are very upset that our health is not being taken seriously. We were told not to wear gloves (we are anyway) and masks are not being worn. We are extremely at risk and are not being valued/protected. Anyone else feeling this way? 
We are the neighborhood grocery store and I love my job. We expected the company that normally takes care of their employees better than most other companies to take the reigns and show the others companies what should be done to protect and value their employees. We are being left in the dust while other grocery stores are getting hazard pay. Pretty disappointed in our company right now."

I would say just have a great fence. Mine is a sweet girl and is quite small do to malnutrition and abuse by assholes before me. She still will take any opportunity to follow her nose. When we have moved she gets nervous and is more prone to wanting to roam but once she settles in, she gets comfortable. I’ve always wanted a loyal off leash dog but BHs are not built for that. She will go wherever her nose does. She stays next to me until something comes up, then she’s running through the hills after god knows what."

A couple of things came to mind: 
people I see on social media that I scroll through and get jealous of... people I don’t even know and that I have no reason to be jealous of. 

The other women that my partner has been with. I naturally compare and have to see them regularly. (We both have been in the same city for a long time. I was married when we met.)

The people that I respect that don’t have any social media’s 

All of these things make it pretty easy to not have it. 
Again, thanks"

As a bipolar person I believe that leaving out that single word wouldn’t have effected the outcome, the impact would have been the same and the connection still would have been made. The way that she held gaze when the elders jumped and didn’t have the visceral reaction that her other “sacrifices” did. 

I really would love to see it again and as someone who is fascinated with true crime, I thought the suicide scene was intriguing but the bipolar punch line was not necessary."
bipolar,eu8gsb9,t1_eu5t5ri,1563556771.0,"I’m not sure if I understand what you mean by needing something (like bipolar) to explain one of the themes. Will you expand on that?
I also felt that I was done after that scene and it being so early wasn’t tactful. I don’t think any explanation of her sister being diagnosed helped the story. She did what she did and that explains her state of mind. 

Hereditary was more tactful and I saw Midsommer because like it so much."

bipolar,eu5m2de,t1_eu5jzyu,1563480424.0,"Was trying not to give spoilers but: in the first scene the main characters sister sends an ominous email and she gets worried, her boyfriend states, “she does this all the time, she’ll bounce back” (or something like that) and she says, “yeah she’s bipolar but this worries me” this is the only explanation for her sister horrifically killing herself and her parents. I just sunk. I wish that they would have just left out “bipolar” it wasn’t necessary. It also makes someone in the audience who isn’t educated on bipolar disorder box us into this corner."
