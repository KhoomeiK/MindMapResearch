Some Rich people just love to hoard money in general."

AskReddit,fbspguo,t3_edyair,1577058396.0,"I don't know what I am, but I agree on many aspects of both parties and also disagree. I believe in the right to bare arms and proper gun regulations, health care should cheaper, it doesn't make sense to go bankrupt just because you were inflected with a disease you had no control over. I see marijuana has a lot of health benefits but it still should be regulated by age and even if necessary (I hate the smell and high people make me nervous when they are driving around). Conservatives have the right to protect their jobs but at the same time it won't hurt to evolve our industries to be more Environmental, but I don't agree on shutting down large industries like coal mining and leaving hundreds of people without jobs (unless there was a way to train everyone to adapt to the changes Instead of having them fend for themselves) 

There should be proper immigration regulations of course, you don't want millions of people flooding in all at once, but immigrants are not bad and in most cases help the economy. I believe the both people in rural areas and cities should have the their rights considered equally. Many conservatives are upset because democrats tend to ignore them and vise versa."
