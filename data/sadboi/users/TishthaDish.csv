ExNoContact,fr2ursj,t1_fr25cqf,1589844289.0,"He met someone new a week after we split at a party. I did everything to contact him-fake fb accounts, burner numbers, new emails, etc. Even though he was with her he never stopped talking to me. She was crazy, moving from another state to be with him after a week, sleeping with a knife under her pillow, breaking his phone, punching him in the face, etc. I had given up on him after he met her and got on POF and started dating again even though I was still heartbroken. I finally met a guy I was super attracted to and he took my mind off my ex and I was happy again. I ran into my ex at a Mardi Gras party. I was making out with my new guy outside in his truck and I wasn‚Äôt aware my ex was outside smoking and saw everything! I think seeing me so sexual with the new guy triggered his jealousy and that the new chick being crazy made him miss me. It was a perfect storm for him to want me back. My advice to you is keep casually dating until you meet someone who you have a spark with. There will be those who make you miss your ex but keep dating because I promise eventually you will meet someone who makes your heart sing!"
