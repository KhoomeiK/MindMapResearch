Postpartum_Depression,fi9lugf,t3_f75yy5,1582271007.0,"You can't force it. Just being there with her is important. It's a hard hole to climb out of, just remind her that you're there for her and you love her and want to help. 

What helped me was antidepressants. I was adamantly against them after some reaction I had in high school, but after I had a panic attack when my son was screaming, I realized I needed more help. Even after that... It took me a bit to start taking them regularly. Now that I am I feel MUCH better. It's not perfect. I get depressed still, but im also starting to do more things that make me happy and getting back out into the world.

Sometimes, we need to remember that we are more than just someone's mommy. Even if being mommy is the best and most important thing we have ever done... Remember it never stops. There's constantly something going on in the back of our minds. From what laundry needs to be put away or what dishes need to be done, bills paid, diapers bought blahblah blah. Give her some ""mom"" time. Send her to the nail salon, take the kiddo out for some baby-dada time so mom can have some time alone. 
I would also suggest therapy. I think if I were in it is be managing my sadness and anger better than I am right now, and I've seen a few. Finding a therapist that clicks with you is not easy. 
Maybe there's something she liked doing before baby was born? A hobby of sorts? You could leave some stuff lying where she'd see it. (Like say if she liked to color in adult coloring books, or of she likes to knit get her some new yarn...etc)
It's rough, and it doesn't just snap back over night. It takes effort. Don't try and force her too much, it may make her feel guilty. 
It's sweet that you're in here and asking for help. ❤️"
