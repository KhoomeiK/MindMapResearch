raisedbyborderlines,firdffq,t3_f984kp,1582662272.0,"Kin, fam. Weird kin to have unfortunately. My mom was very obsessed with my growth, and any attempt I made at privacy over my own body was met with resistance. I agree with you, I think she felt the need to be involved in every aspect of my life, but unfortunately for her, I am and always have been a private person. Her attempts at barricading my boundaries made them worse however, and I still suffer the ripple effects. 

Once she cornered me in the bathroom after I had gotten out of the shower. She wanted to see how my breasts were developing. I can't remember what age I was but it was probably around late elementary/junior high. I ran down the hall from the bathroom to my bedroom, and she chased me. I attempted to close my bedroom door, she came in anyway, so I went in my closet, she went in there also. The whole time I'm holding my arms over my chest because I don't want to show her my tits. She's trying to turn me around and I'm screaming at her to leave me alone, and eventually she gave up with a huff and took off. That never happened again. It is a bizarre thing that happened. If I think about it too long, I still don't understand wanting to see your daughter's tits. What for? What was she possibly going to glean in seeing my tits? What would it have mattered?

Later in life, when I'm maybe 19 or so, my folks dragged me to therapy under the lie that we were going to do something together and cornered me about the relationships I was developing on the internet. In this conversation I became angry that no, I would not be an online cam girl as I'm not even comfortable taking my shirt off when intimate with partners, which is still true to this day, and I brought that up to her and blamed her, and she cried immediately, playing the victim like ""I didn't know!""

I have a hard time accepting gifts from my folks.

I realize now that I don't have to pretend to be more enthusiastic than I am, and if my Daria isn't good enough for them then so be it. At this point, it's all in my head.

I have no further aims to make things better, because I do not believe they can get better. I believe I can make my situation in this circumstance better by adjusting to the change and laying out boundaries for her to adjust to the change as well.

I mourned my mother, the one I never really had. It sucks. It still sucks. It sucks knowing she is alive but she's not not there, not the version of her that is in my mind when I think of my mother as ""Momma."" Whether or not you adopt these opinions is unknown, and you are entitled to whatever opinion you want to have about your mom. You are allowed the relationship with your mom that you want. My therapist told me that I don't have to lose my mom just because she took my mom away from me. It's been an adjustment in attitude and mentality on my part.

I think it is important to go after what you think is best for you, which I understand is really weak advice, but it is the best advice that can be given. What do you feel when you imagine therapy with your mom? 

Some say it doesn't help to throw your emotions at them because you won't get the response you want/need. If you're not in it for the response then say whatever you'd like. The best I can say is have no expectations when speaking with this person, good bad or otherwise. If you ever have positive expectations, you will be disappointed more likely than not, but that isn't to say I am dissuading you from taking the actions you want to. It is important to do what you want to do: it is YOUR life after all, and you are free from her and anyone else who will tell you what you should do. So, what do you think you should do?"

Typically when I go for any of these things, I either don't get a response for a long time if at all, she doesn't answer for whatever reason and doesn't call back, or she's sleeping. Mine made me feel like I was the avenue through which her happiness traveled. I've since chosen that is not the life I want to live. For example, mine is baby fixated. I used to feel like I had to have a baby to give my mom a grandchild that she could see regularly (my older brother with boundaries stays away mostly save for holidays and birthdays). Now that I am going on 31 (I felt similarly when entering 30, welcome!) I realize that is a really fucked up thought process, having a baby so my mom can have a regular grandkid? Just no.

I spoke with my therapist about this recently. She told me that getting what I asked for in this regard is not something I'm used to getting, so I'm expecting something else and that's not happening either. I too struggle with thinking they're probably pissed at me, but we gotta let that go. If they are giving us space, and we wanted space, then we need to learn that it's okay to actually receive space. Of course we are waiting for the other shoe to drop, because all we know is walking on eggshells while shoes are dropping left and right, but we owe it to ourselves to settle into the feeling. My therapist says it's important to acknowledge the feeling, allow it, and then move on. 

Reach out to them again when you are fully ready, not because you feel like you have to. Obligation is not the right reason to make human connections.

None of it was your fault. You did everything you could. Self-forgiveness is not easy and sometimes we feel bad about the relief we feel from not having to be there to deal with it, and that is okay.

About a year after these events, my friend Lisa started doing acid and ecstasy so I told her mom (we had been friends since like second grade, I was worried about her), she lied to her mom and swore I made up lies, her mom told me off, and she threatened to kill me if she ever saw me again, soooo I can’t say with severity I know how they turned out recently, however upon catching up on them via Facebook maybe five years ago iirc they’re still trashy but now Lisa has at least one kid and maybe she doesn’t do hard drugs anymore."

As a result, I deleted facebook off my phone and won't go on there for a yet-to-be-determined amount of time. It's just too much shit. People think they own their kids but they don't.

It's fucking annoying the way she fawns over my appearance.

She was the exact same about nudity with me. She would call me into her bedroom while she was doing something and I'd turn the corner to find her naked and grooming herself in some fashion having just gotten out of the shower. Since I was a child. One time she chased me down the hallway into my closet to try to see my chest because she wanted to know how I was developing. I've always been very physically private, and she has always hated that, and I have never understood why she wanted me to be comfortably naked in front of her the way she was in front of me. My sister is the same way. I just don't get it. I don't even like being completely naked in front of my romantic partners, unless we're in the shower, to this day. I really do think her pressing me into nudism (it wasn't that extreme but I really don't know what else to call it) only further pushed me into being a private person. I hate not wearing bras. I cannot be topless during sex. So it goes."

Love can look like whatever you want it to look like, and as you continue through life, it will change and grow, depending on how much work you put into it. Be aware of the trap ""you accept the love you think you deserve."" I spent a lot of years in emotionally abusive and one-sided relationships because of what I went through. It may happen to you, and if it does, that's okay! We all learn. Life is long, it's okay to make mistakes. Forgive yourself always, and be patient.

And SAME about the dad situation!
