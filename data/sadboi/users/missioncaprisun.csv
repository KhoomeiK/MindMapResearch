relationship_advice,fqg0k34,t3_gi9vko,1589335428.0,"My friend got pregnant naturally with stage 4 Endo and a 2% chance of getting pregnant. Not to get her hopes up but maybe not to let them get completely ruined either :o)

Also, there are diets Endo diet and just general anti inflammatory diets that help to reduce the inflammation. It could possibly help and prevent more. Birth control I think helps to limit the amount of tissue since it thins the lining... Not a doctor. Just have a handful of friends with it so I've learned from them. Definitely have her see a therapist to work through the emotions she's feeling and continue to ask her doctor about options. If not she can see other types of doctors for alternative treatments and such like the diets."

I'm just proud of myself for getting through my workouts so far. My goal is to lose 55lbs. I don't have a time frame for that because I don't want to set myself up for failure. However long it takes, it will take. Ultimately the goal is to just feel happier with myself, be stronger and healthier stronger.

Cheers to all of you who have been on this journey and all of you just starting too! We got this!"

She also disrespected not just your relationship but your boundaries and you too by sharing your sex tape with others. That's a very intimate thing.

BreakUps,f8sy99s,t1_f8sxdru,1574791742.0,Honestly idfk. My heart isn't going anywhere but I can't just WAIT for him when there is no guarantee he is coming back. I'm going to continue my therapy amd growing myself. If I feel ready to date I guess I will but at this point I guess I'm technically waiting but only because I'm not ready to move on. Idk lol. No real answer to that.
BreakUps,f8sx265,t1_f8swpf9,1574791001.0,"Yes I agree. But I just feel that people can work on themselves and be independent while loving others. I'm in my own therapy, school, work, etc. All of my own stuff and progress within myself but can still love the ones around me. But I guess that's what makes me different than him. Or he's just in that low of a place that he has to focus on just himself. I do get that part. It's just hard.

And you're right. Walking away will be best for them at the same time because even though they say they don't love anything they do and that's why they feel guilty for hurting others. Meh. :-/"

Just told him I don't have anything to offer today if it was a bad day so it's hard for me to understand his situation. I know that we're all different but isnt the point to love someone through thick and thin, *sickness* and health. You love them through it. Idk I respect him and I tell him it's okay to not be okay and that I'm glad he's in therapy to work on himself but why did I have to be kicked out to do it.

BreakUps,f8pbso3,t1_f8pbad5,1574698937.0,I've never used a dating app before. I've been with someone for 4 years and we live together. He stopped putting on effort and stopped caring. Then got depressed (or maybe has been the whole time?) Just kicked me out out of no where with no time to process anything. Half my stuff is still there. Just gave up. Didn't want to put the effort in. And I know a lot of it is probably the depression talking but you don't just throw someone away. Literally throw them away. Like what? So many people do this now. They'll be married for 10 years and instead of dating themselves and their spouse to continue the connection they just walk away from it all. It's bullshit.

BreakUp,f8nia3i,t3_e16giu,1574644658.0,I'm so sorry you're going through this. Do you go to counseling or anything to learn how to communicate? It's not something that you can sit down together and figure out? Write letters to each other to express how you're feeling instead of however you normally react? Just ideas since idk details but sometimes it's easier to communicate without being face to face. That way you're not holding things either and you're thinking before you talk.
