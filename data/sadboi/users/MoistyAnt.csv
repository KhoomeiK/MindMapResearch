whowouldwin,fj5pw90,t1_fj5miaw,1583039260.0,Prime All Might is more of a match for No Gauntlet Thanos and Prime All Might would probably win due to him having easy scaling that puts him a relativistic light speed and power that is much closer to Thanos and may even succeed it. Still wouldn't beat Gauntlet Thanos with all the stones but would definitely best No Gauntlet Thanos.
Konosuba,fj5pkzs,t1_fj5me9k,1583038986.0,Yeah only Re zero is going to continue for a little while but Konosuba will always have a place in my heart.
whowouldwin,fj5pgn5,t1_fj5miaw,1583038882.0,"oh oops totally forgot I was arguing MCU Thanos. Lemme just concede my last post.  Anyways MCU Thanos can generally be scaled in a few ways. Thanos without the gauntlet is more or less stronger than the Hulk and comparable to Thor with his hammer. Thanos was able to react to Thors attacks and Thor is the same dude who can react to Lightning which isn't all surprising with him being the god of thunder. Hulk and Thor are very much comparable in terms of strength and combat speed (lightning amped Thor is stronger and faster however but they're still comparable). Thanos with only the power stone clapped that same Thor but because Thanos had the power stone it wouldnt be fair to use that feat to scale no gauntlet Thanos. However in that same scene, Thanos effortlessly slapped Hulk who has comparable stats to Thor. Thor can be comparable to having large town to city level of power ( endured the explosion of Sokovia which backs up his durability, shook a mountain by dropping Mjolnir on it, creates thunder storms that can cover Wakanda). Hulk being comparable to Thor and Thanos beating Hulk (and fat Thor if you wanna count that) can mean that Thanos has these cityesque busting strength and lightning fast reactions. The other way to scale him is using the Captain Marvel feat which I already explained which makes him relatively light speed but I can understand if you don't want to accept that feat. 

Deku does show impressive feats that can somewhat be compared to Thanos but but he's always hindered by his inability to draw our his full power without the help of 2nd or third party allies. If we allow Deku to have outside help then it's only fair to compare him to Gauntlet Thanos which won't even make a fair match (even tho the gauntlet would count as apart of thanos' arsenal). Deku at his cap with no help is about 20 percent and he displays feats that can be considered large building level. His speed is somewhat around hypersonic being compared to OverHaul. His 100 percent capabilities show much more promising feats with his speed and power but again, Deku can only reach that with outside help like Eri. At most, a 100 percent Deku is somewhat comparable to Thanos without his gauntlet but Thanos shows lightning speed reactions by fighting with beings who scale to lightning (quite literally) and displaying feats of power that are a stronger than Dekus. Thanos just shows faster reaction speed even if we dont use use my Captain Marvel feat and is overall stronger than Deku. For argue for Dekus win against no gauntlet MCU Thanos, it will require some high balling and allowing Deku to use outside help. At most maybe there comparable in strength if Deku is at 100 percent strength so if Deku ever reaches a stage where he can freely use his full power than he can maybe win against no gauntlet Thanos but because Deku is basically nerfed all the time and isn't able to use his full power, he just doesn't show the feats to beat Thanos."

whowouldwin,fj5lqtk,t1_fg3d0h3,1583035927.0,Replying to this comment very much later but those are outliers due to the many writers that write marvel. Its consistency shown that Thanos 4D feats and above especially in the current comics that are being released with thanos being this very strong villian with galactic shattering powers (downplaying his feats right now). Deku isn't touching Thanos.

whowouldwin,ffb9dty,t1_ffb7yyl,1579756015.0," ""But did he actually create a full-fledged universe? You know, a tangible space occupied by matter and the entire cosmos? Based on how GER's ability is described, it would be more plausible to say that he is a reality warper who places the opponent's consciousness in a pocket dimension to manipulate. What happens there doesn't seem to have any consequence to the real world beyond making his enemy fodder.""

I agree that GER is a reality warper but Diavolo's conciousness was not only taken because Diavolo's body disappeared ""or was implied too"". GER has different METAS from which he can scaled from. There's the pocket dimension meta where GER creates a small space in reality where Diavolo dies for infinity; the low multiversal meta where GER can be scaled to be low mulitiverisal due to the fact that GER has a universal range in his attack nullification based off his feat where he negated KC time skip which is universial in range. Using that feat, we make the assumption that GER is capable of creating a full fledged universe where Diavolo infinity dies in which makes sense because GER has proven to have infinite range in his capabilities and also because Diavolo has to die an infinite different deaths. Lastly theres the wanked mulitverisal meta where GER creates a universe every time Diavolo dies for all infinity which is a huge stretch. It's more likely that GER is low multiversal just based off of his time skip nullification feat using his reality warping. 

""I've never read Steel Ball Run so I can't really argue a point, but after looking a little into the material, it seems like a really difficult ability to benchmark because of the conditions needed to be met and the limitations of the user. I'll let someone else give it go.""

You're correct. Conditions do have to be met which makes him very vulnerable to stronger opponents but his max power is universal.


"" Ah, I see now, you're using VS Battles Wiki's tier system? That was my mistake for not realizing it. I typically take an unorthodox approach to rank power scaling because of VS Battles' tiering doesn't really dictate where a character stands in the power hierarchy. I'll retract what I said then""

Well in simpler terms because its easier for people to understand when u use Tier C or Tier B etc. I don't really take vs battle wiki poweacaling as fact because they have wack scaling at times but I do use their terminology in my own scaling. 

""Dude, just because some of my diction is archaic doesn't mean the term is irrelevant. (－‸ლ) ""Jest"" is merely a synonym for ""joke"". It's a habit of mine of letting my scholarly tone leak from my essays to my Reddit comments/post.""

whowouldwin,ff7778t,t1_feowtkq,1579642479.0,GER and tusk 4 can only defeat universal threats or in Ger case low multiversal threats. But your right literally a shit ton if characters can destroy GER and Tusk and even True form Pennywise who's outerverisal. Fiction is crazy man
whowouldwin,ff770c5,t1_fem4zyh,1579642368.0,"TL:DR never said pennywise was omnipotent because outerverisal is different from omnipotence. Know your terms before attempting to debunk something lol.


1. GER and Tusk 4 can be scaled to universal to low mulitiverisal. GER created a universe where diavolo infinitely dies in which is low mulitiverisal. Tusk Act can spin at infinite speeds and generate infinite energy thus making him universial.

2. Did I say Pennywise was omnipotent? No I didn't dude. Outerverisal is different from omnipotent. Outerverisal ( or tier 0) just means reality doesnt apply to you and your beyond concepts like space,time and dimensions. Multiple characters can be outerverisal in the same verse. For an example, in the cthulu verse there is a whole race of gods that are called outergods. All of the outergods are outerverisal and there are outerverisal gods that are stronger than other outerverisal gods. Like Azathoth is a outerverisal god and he's stronger than Shub- Niggurath who's also outerverisal. Pennywises true form is an outerverisal deity because he can be scaled to different outervsial gods in that verse like Maturin Turtle who's a deity that predates creation itself. Please know  your scaling and terms before you debunk something everyone knows. 

3. Really? Jest? What are we in medieval times or something?

Edit: Omnipotence means no matter what you will always be the strongest and you can do anything and you are basically an untouchable all powerful deity."

whowouldwin,ff48g5t,t3_erdpzo,1579557813.0,"Barney Stinson wins no diff. Super sayian is a 50 times multiplier to all stats (durability,speed, reaction time, combat speed, strength etc). If Neil is average human level, he can punch with 170 pounds of force, times that by 50 and that's 8500 pounds of force which is insane (super human tier). 

Same follows with striking speed and reaction speed

Average humans punches with the speed of about 20mph

20×50= 1000mph

Average human can react to visual stimus at .25s 

0.25÷50= 0.005s 

 
This easily puts him at superhuman tier. Not to mention that using some guides, mastered super sayian can be calculated to be a 500 times multiplier which would make Barney easily one of the strongest beings on earth if he has mastered super sayian (10,000mph punching speed, 85,000 pounds of striking power and 0.0005 reaction speed to visual stimus)! I won't go too crazy but its food for thought.

Also, it was stated forbaded by the movie (by thanos himself) that he's going to destory the universe and restart it with the infinity gauntlet.  Deku rlly has nothing on Thanos. Thanos would win basically with no difficulty : he can stop time and kill deku, turn deku into jelly and then kill him, one punch deku with the power stone that's atleast large surface level ( surfaced wiped a large planet and GOTG) or can mind control deku.

I'm also glad that when u do move your bf will be with you too, will u closer to ur friends and family or further?"
mentalhealth,f67dbk7,t1_f67coxv,1572718588.0,Ik this is literally what I am fighting with too. Cuz I also decided to focus on myself but I have before with the person I told u about but now it's just me all alone cuz I sacrificed everything for herand now I'm rlly all alone and i dont wanna be
mentalhealth,f67bny8,t1_f670ptk,1572718237.0,Omg I'm acc going thru soemthing similar to this rn. Like with instead of it being my partner it's my closest best friend who I loved with all my heart
mentalhealth,f66n8zq,t1_f66ku9r,1572712417.0,"I see. Thank you telling me these details. First things first!! Yes I think you should tell your boss for sure. He sounds supportive by what u have said so I think it's a good call. When you move will u quit the job? 

Secondly concerning your bf, I think you are right he does want to support you but he doesn't know how. I think the best thing for this is couples therapy so that he can learn how to help u or even just therapy. Of course its expensive so I think right now I suggest having someone with you who u can talk to about this and can support u with your issues. Do you have any family or friends who fit that bill? Also do you and your partner live in the same apartment?"
mentalhealth,f66ib6l,t3_dq7859,1572711147.0,I'm literally so proud of u. It's so awesome how there are ppl who can fight thru their battles and win! Keep up the amazing work :D
mentalhealth,f66hwc4,t3_dqkfx0,1572711006.0,That's awesome!!!
mentalhealth,f66hrf2,t3_dqm5p1,1572710979.0,"Awh man I feel totally useless rn cuz I'm only 16 and I don't work much but I didnt wanna just leave you and not attempt to help u. I have anxiety problems that usually comes at random when I'm in a low point in my life and rn I'm in one so I get anxious pretty often. Anyways I'm not tryna make it about me, my point is that ik what ur going through. I think maybe u should address this to your boss and how does ur bf react when u tell him stuff like this?. Also what's your job and does your job stress you out a lot?"
mentalhealth,f66fn0j,t1_f66f3rb,1572710349.0,Awh thank you!! <33
mentalhealth,f65c6f3,t1_f65byrq,1572700941.0,thank you!! :D
mentalhealth,f65aq7t,t1_f659qui,1572700583.0,I'm 100 percent certain he would be proud of you. I'm really sorry u have no one to say that to u. I doubt it means anything cux I literally just met u on your comment thread but I think that you're a very caring person and strong willed and I think you have to see this in yourself too. If I got this as my first impression from just exchanging a fire comments with you then u must be a good person.
mentalhealth,f659frr,t1_f657to9,1572700252.0,"Wow he sounds absolutely amazing it sounds almost fictional but knowing a person like your friend existed is rlly st great. I also enjoy helping people too or making them even feel a bit better because to me making ppl happy just kinda makes me happy idk how to explain it. I just kinda dislike when people aren't happy. Your friend is someone I would hope to be and aim to be when I'm older cuz he sounds like an absolute role model and pretty cool. I think your a great person too, not only are u still preserving and still fighting but ur taking time out of ur day to sympathize with total strangers who u have no emotion ties too and even compliment them and make them happy. I am certain your friend would be extremely proud of u."
mentalhealth,f656sdh,t1_f656ab5,1572699542.0,Ugh thank you for this comment!! Its a great start to my day and I have a feeling that td will be a better one cuz of this. This comment means a lot to me so thank you and ik it sounds dramatic but rlly thank you!!
mentalhealth,f655wou,t1_f6553jn,1572699276.0,Well I don't think I'm a prime example of a citizen there are certainly way better people than by a long shot but thank you. I'm just thinking that the standard of what people should be doing is help each other if they are in need. It sounds naïve and stuff but it's st I rlly do believe in.
mentalhealth,f654w2q,t1_f654oi5,1572699039.0,Of course but you don't needa thank me. This is what people should be doing which is being there for each other.
