ask,fqshvt8,t1_fqpvunm,1589607717.0,Yeah this doesnt sound it cuz I'm not really afraid of bugs as a whole? I actually quite like some bugs and find them cute. I also dont have any illusions of them on me.
actuallesbians,fqpryqd,t1_fqpr817,1589552859.0,"Hmm I'll check that out, it does sound pretty interesting"
ask,fqprs0p,t1_fqprac7,1589552758.0,"TwT No, my town is so small we dont even have a movie theater and the only bars we have are for old conservatives and bikers. Not to mention anyone in my dating range I would have went to school with and im... deviantly not interested in traveling up that desperate road LOL

I'll try that app out! It's better than nothing haha"
actuallesbians,fqpr8f9,t1_fqppwtu,1589552464.0,Honestly that's another reason why I hate it. I mean k may dislike the labels but I dislike people being made fun of for using one of them even more
actuallesbians,fqpqwjj,t1_fqpq1bz,1589552284.0,"Yeah, that makes since. I think the stereotypes is another reason I dislike them. Maybe the meaning really has changed towards what kind of energy you give off rather than your preferred roll?"
ask,fqpnb12,t1_fqpls92,1589550257.0,Hmm...you could maybe see if you can get a lawyer. They have free legal aid in most places and you could at least get their parental custody taken away so they could no longer have control over what happens to your brother. You could then go further and get restraining orders.
ask,fqpky2d,t3_gjmtc2,1589548809.0,Lol no? Literally no different than if you were dating someone and then both of your parents hooked up. It's not like you grew up together
ask,fqpk597,t3_gjvo9p,1589548301.0,"You have some kind of mental illness. Sounds like apathy depression or something? You need therapy to find out exactly what and then the therapist can help a doctor diagnose you and hopefully get you on some meds.

I have depression myself and I very frequently just ""disappear"". Although its. Bit different from you since I just flat out forget people exist sometimes but yeah it's a thing that's not normal and you can get help for."
ask,fqpjojy,t1_fqphvga,1589548000.0,"Hmm this doesnt seem right. It focuses on a fear of insects (or the like) where  as, I'm not actually afraid of bugs?? More that I'm afraid of ANYTHING burrowing into me or the sensation of something crawling on me."
ask,fqpjchp,t3_gjwxex,1589547784.0,"Sounds like depression man. You need to go to therapy to talk it out and figure out your exact problems and then a doctor can help get you on some right meds.

I have depression myself and I noticeably ""feel"" things less than other people. It's not like its impossible for you to laugh or like...have fun when you go out but like...it never seems like it's what people are supposed to feel? I dont wanna ramble too much but yeah, you need to talk to professionals becuase it's not normal and you deserve to be able to feel things like other people do"
ask,fqpiq88,t3_gjz0cx,1589547376.0,"Not 100% certain but I believe you can call the depression hotline for this. Those people are trained how to handle suicidal people so they'd probably give you the best advice.

I'd also see if you can discreetly get in contact with any friends or family she has and tell them you want to break up with her but are concerned for her safety when you do so."
ask,fqpid9w,t3_gk094y,1589547133.0,"I mean...did you enjoy it? You could have disassociated becuase you didnt like it or it was unpleasant. If so, I'd recommend thinking about why you felt that way"
ask,fqpi1e0,t3_gjxjcb,1589546905.0,"Go secret agent and record proof of abuse. They literally go to jail for any of this. Take pictures of injuries and the like. I mean they deserve it and itll be hard for the police to ignore if you have actual video evidance or even voice recordings.

Try and keep a voice recording app on your phone that is quick and easy to get too. That way you can even record what's happening if you phone get thrown somewhere.

You could also use any evidence to blackmail them into leaving you and your brother alone."
ask,fqph99h,t3_gk03n8,1589546356.0,"3 years isnt really that bad but the whole turning 18 thing is deff always a unnerving thing. It's a difficult situation and if you hadn't been daring for a year I'd probably say end it but a good friend if mine had a similar thing happen in which the guy thought she was older even tho she never hid her age and now they're married so it CAN work out just fine.

Tbh I think you should talk to your parents about it and then ask if you should talk to her parents too about the situation. You're not in the wrong here but if you continue you should get her parents concent. You should get it in writing too so you'll be protected legally if her parents decide to be crazy and call the cops for whatever reason. It happens. I've heard of parents doing it just becuase they changed their mind or something and y ou u dont want that on your record.

Basically it's a sticky situation but as long as you do this maturely then it shouldnt be a problem."
ask,fqpgavb,t3_gk3e8h,1589545653.0,A better option is to facetime and then read your message to her so nothing sounds aggressive and you both have the opportunity to see each others emotional response. If you still want to be with her you should iterate that and explain that you want to talk about this so you dont have the tension between yall anymore. Express you want to fix this becuase you love her and dont want to keep fighting
ask,fqpfwnh,t3_gk40i0,1589545356.0,"If I were you I'd say something like ""I really like you and dont mind that you're trans at all. I see you as a women but I'm afraid I might do something wrong somehow. Please let me know if I ever do anything wrong"""

depression,exe3y94,t3_cs2ogj,1566197289.0,You should really confide in either them or a professional. There is also online help. Most important would be learning coping mechanisms and finding ways to spark joy

Honestly I still dont get the fuss over it. It's not like I'm slobbering all over the chip and the part that's left after I bite it has only touched my lips really ¯\_('-')_/¯"

98% of the time I have 20/20 vision tho"

aggretsuko,erjk49k,t3_c27scd,1560933843.0,"Really? but this is everything that MAKES her a good female character! She feels so real. These are the same issues and problems any other girl could have and the way she reacts to her problems are very believable. She's a ditsy daydreamer going through the motions with no real plan for the future. Season 2's main focus wasn't even truly her finding/looking for a relationship. It was her struggle with being afraid to grow up. The idea of Marriage being pushed on her made her feel like she was being rushed to grow up. She rejected it because the idea scared her even though it's shown that she'd really like to met ""the one"". The season ending with her admitting that one of her dreams is to get married and have kids is hugely symbolic by saying she's now comfortable with the idea of growing up and becoming a ""adult""."
anime,eof2zmc,t1_eof27ur,1558519750.0,Havent seen the show but by her looks Id call her a loli. She deff looks the part and is more on par with what I thought a more traditional concept of a loli would be

anime,eof24go,t1_eof1xqn,1558518291.0,"I defiantly have never had any nsfw interest in character that acts young like that but I still find them very cute like I would a kitten! I wonder what you would call a mentally mature and legal aged anime girl that is still small and cute then??  
\-edit-

I also wouldnt call Yoko a loli? Loli for me has a certain look to it and Yoko fits in with the look of most teen anime girls."
