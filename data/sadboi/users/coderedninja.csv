Anger,foyhgxp,t3_ga4fiz,1588172601.0,"Are you reliant on your sister? For money and housing? Why are you listening to her needs when she never gives what she promises? They are all false promises and everytime it works she will keep doing it.

While others can tell you on Reddit that they are sorry for you and tell you to get help and such, I can tell you to take action:

Use reverse psychology. Don’t play her mind games anymore - you mentioned you used to fall for it but not anymore. The best revenge is having a great life without her in it. Does this make sense? 

Ignore her. Put her in the last of your priorities. Say things like: “I have better things to do than listen to you complain. Do something about it.” Then walk away.

Maybe she says something like, “but you said you would do this for me” then you respond, “so that you don’t give me what you promise?” (Walk away and don’t do a favor for her ever again). 

Every time she calls Mom over, let her. Stay quiet and when all said and done, tell Mom with sister in the room, “She is 20 years old and constantly calls for you whenever we have a disagreement. Isn’t that interesting because I’m 12 years old? She doesn’t understand that maybe I don’t want to be manipulated and abused by her all the time. (Talking to Sister) from now on, do not come to me for help and interact with me. I am done being a doormat to you and if you ever try something again, I will get other people involved.” (Make sure Mom hears this).

Sister may feel threatened and walk away. When you get that alone time with Mom, you tell her “I need you on my side. She has been hurting me and telling lies about me. And you aren’t believing a word when I show you the physical wounds she did to me. The next time this happens and you dismiss it, I’m calling the police. Sister is old enough to get what she wants without hurting me and you knew long enough that she has been hurting me. I will call the authorities on you for not doing anything about this abuse.” Then walk away.

It is about you putting your foot down and saying what you need to say to protect yourself. You can think much more clearly when you are physically safe. Let me know if you need further explanation."

Has he hurt anyone in the past? Did he brag about it or dismiss a death like its nothing? If you can get to know about his childhood, has he hurt animals before or worse, killed or tortured? Some people had childhoods like that and while some don’t continue that behavior anymore, other continue to kill/torture in silence and can gradually grow to hurting people."

Like saying something like:

- You sound insecure. You need to shut up and get out of my face.
- Everytime you talk all I hear is a whining little girl who blames people for their own personal issues.
- What’s your problem? (In a confrontational way) oh, what I do bothers you? Then go away and stop making it your problem!! All you do is create more problems by pointing out little things that don’t matter
- Mind your own business.
-shut up your breath smells like ass.
- if you insult him back, and he cries about it too iust like how he cried about you protecting yourself physically, just say like “oh? You can’t even take shit when you give to me and other people? Fucking pussy. Grow the fuck up immature child”
-literally condescend every action he takes and if he has a problem with it, be like oh? So you can do it and I can’t?
-literally put him down

The goal of all of this is to make him aware that what he does feels like shit and HOPEFULLY he understand not to invade your space. Speaking of invading your space, just like how he tries to enter your room (your safe spot from any troubles of life), do the same and forcibly enter his room.

toxicparents,fmy3up3,t3_fy0kci,1586477542.0,"Same thing happens to my brother who was dating his girlfriend of few years and now engaged. But anyway, during the time they were dating, my mom would be the first to make comments like he always thinks about himself and only cares about other people, and not care about our family. Unfortunately, my sister and I grew up to be toxic as well and went along with it too, saying how he just doesn’t want to spend time with his family and how he is ungrateful and stuff like that. Dad just stays quiet and minds his own business.

Obviously, now I am well aware of our toxic behavior and stopped immediately, as well as called out both of them to stop saying that every time they do. What your mother has been saying behind your back is unacceptable and I am sorry you had to hear it from others. 

But if I were you, I would confront her if you haven’t already and say that out of all people you have asked permission from, you asked her. You respected her enough to ask for permission. And when she said yes, you felt that everything is all right. But ask why is she disrespecting you especially behind your back? Does she have something against you? If so, say it now because what she is doing is very immature and petty and honestly doesn’t make her look good at all. 

Honestly, knowing myself with a history of toxic behavior, it is better to work with other people than to fight on your own. Get your siblings and cousins, and other family members who are on your side and let them know what happened and that if they truly support you and respect you, that if your mom says something like that again, that they fight for you even when you are not there. Team up.

I do it for my siblings now. A couple times my mom wanted to show up at my brothers house unannounced, without even asking if it was okay, to which I asked, “Did you ask him?” She said no. Then I said, you have to respect his space and ask if it is okay for you to visit because what if he had something to do and you showing up could interfere with work or other plans? I stood up to my toxic mother to protect my brother’s privacy. Because I would want my siblings to do that for me as well.

Remember, help yourself first so you can help others. If your mom can’t respect you while you’re gone, why respect her opinions and permission? Tell her that, if she can’t do that, you are and will make your own choices with her permission (unless if it is something like borrowing her money or car). Fuck, don’t even bother asking for permission anymore."

If you are relying on him for money, pick up a part time job and save some money so you could at least feed yourself if you were ever to move out to the shelter.
