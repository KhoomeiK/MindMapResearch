Anyway! Lovely drawing! Hoard as many labels as you want like a dragon!"
Osana,fp32cmn,t3_gamy0t,1588271897.0,"God, I still remember how he made the whole ""18+"" declaration back in 2015 when students in the locker rooms would strip naked with only steam clouds covering the bare minimum of their bodies. People got pissed at him for it and that's around the time he said they were all 18...

So yeah, it's been bullshit from the start. I'll bet he didn't anticipate people to actually hold him to it though."
