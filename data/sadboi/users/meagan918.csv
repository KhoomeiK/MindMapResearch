HairDye,fnk174x,t1_fnk1318,1587012050.0,it was the burgundy l’oréal colorista. somehow it faded to green/blue. i don’t think they’ll fade anymore
ptsd,fm6yx1h,t1_fm021po,1585807481.0,thank you. i definitely will do that
ptsd,fjh1v7b,t1_fjh0ote,1583339648.0,i’m sorry you have to go through nightmares too. it’s not fair :/
ptsd,fjgpdge,t1_fjgl7ab,1583332585.0,i feel like he’d be understanding. i’ve asked stuff about this a couple times. i’m just worried he’ll think i don’t trust him or something
ptsd,fjfjrex,t3_fd70uh,1583293224.0,i never go through his phone but i know his passcode and i use his phone in the car for the gps and for music so i know it’s not on there
ptsd,fi6vqhw,t1_fi6feqj,1582208607.0,thank you. i’m sorry you’ve been through something that caused you to relate. i hope you’re healing too
ptsd,fi62tx2,t1_fi62joh,1582177172.0,yeah i actually just talked to him about it yesterday. he’s not a phone person. he prefers talking face to face but that’s just not something we can do because i don’t have a car so i can’t drive to him. he can only drive to me when it fits with both of our schedules. but i think our conversation yesterday helped understand how i was feeling. luckily i’m with someone who really listens to me when i’m talk no matter what it is. we started dating at the same time i finally admitted what happened to me and started working on it and he’s been so patient and understanding through it all.
ptsd,fi624nj,t1_fi61w3s,1582176554.0,it just sucks bc i’m in college 45 mins away from where he lives and the time apart is hard on me because if we don’t talk as much one day i think it’s my fault and that i did something wrong but life just happens sometimes and people get busy. thank you for your suggestions. i appreciate it
ptsd,fi61qqt,t1_fi61lmb,1582176223.0,thank you i think i’ll try that. i know he’ll be understand. i know it hurts him to see me hurt and maybe if i help him understand it’ll help both of us.
ptsd,fh1xtnc,t1_fh1qfnn,1581227614.0,thank you!!
ptsd,fh1jozo,t1_fh1hbj6,1581216566.0,you’re right. i’m gonna do some research into how i can make an anonymous complaint. i don’t want anyone to think that’s okay.
ptsd,fgyuzuy,t1_fgynrm5,1581187400.0,i have social anxiety so it’s hard for me to talk to people especially if they have authority. just don’t want to be singled out or anything. i’m just gonna hope it doesn’t happen again
ptsd,fgynhz2,t1_fgym8bl,1581185066.0,i know it’s ridiculous. my psych professor last semester made it clear that those jokes were not okay. i’m worried this class could become an issue for me.
ptsd,fgxttgx,t3_f0gda4,1581176533.0,"just the other day in class my abnormal psychology professor brought up a neuron on the board and goes “is anyone having ptsd from biology class?”. i was shocked. not only is he a psychology professor, he also is a practicing clinical psychologist and ran a psychiatric hospital for 6 years. it rubbed me the wrong way. that’s not okay. he sees probably sees people who have ptsd. imagine if they knew he made those jokes. it’s not right. i wanted to cry in the middle of class. it just invalidates it every time someone makes a joke."
ptsd,fgl7oy5,t3_eyxdiw,1580884916.0,"hello, i am so sorry to hear you are going through this. you are not alone. i also have a history of only unwanted and abusive sex. i applaud you for reaching out because it’s not easy to do. i am also now i’m a relationship where i want to have sex with my SO. my suggestion is having a sit down with him. tell him how you’re feeling. listen to his feelings as well. but DONT FORGET you are your top priority. you need someone supportive who will understand. maybe you two can have a conversation about that. another thing that i found that helps when i start feeling that way is to remind myself, “he is not my abuser”. it’s hard when all you’ve known is abusive and unwanted sex. sex becomes associated with those negative feelings so it is perfectly understandable why it can be difficult to perform the way you are expecting yourself to. you need to do what makes you comfortable and what makes you feel safe. i hope everything turns out alright"
ptsd,ffsfklm,t1_ffqp63k,1580180481.0,thank you. it’s just frustrating that it’s still effecting me. i’m really sorry you went through something similar
