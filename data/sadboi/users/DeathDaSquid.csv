I have a coworker thats more extroverted but he gets so aggressive over random stuff it kinda makes you not wanna be around him. He apparently use to hang out with marines and go to crazy bars and shit and im like why are you in IT then??"
rant,f45p7wr,t3_dje9v2,1571388167.0,"This is where im at at 24. Definitely i agree with what you mention about work friends, i do just enough to come off as friendly and thats about it. There can be so much gossip and hidden work politics when life is already so stressful.


Having a hobby is key, music seems like the only thing keeping me sane sometimes"

someone was just talking about how you cant get the real bass experience from a pair of headphones... Im pretty sure he was talking about something like this."

depression,eytseeb,t1_eyt46k2,1567444505.0,I'm in the same position as well where i feel like i have to completely rebuild myself but i cant help but reminisce on who i use to be. Sometimes i don't want to bother because it feels so forced and fake and such a downgrade from who i use to be.
depression,eytrs3j,t3_cynqrf,1567444088.0,"Holy shit, this is like one of the few takes on depression that really resonates with me. Like your not sad or suicidal enough to show it. Ur just living this mundane existence where doing basic shit is so fucking hard to accomplish and the only conclusion you can come to is ur just a piece of shit and failure because you dont really feel anything that tells you there's a problem that needs to be fixed, everything just fucking sucks."

HeadphoneAdvice,ey6e3c7,t1_ey46h2d,1566853451.0,"> The point of diminishing returns is roughly $100-150 IMO. 

This is where I stopped honestly. It seems like most cans outside this range, especially  $300+, become more about the build quality and the material they're made out of than the actual sound"

headphones,evgjz9b,t3_cj9fj7,1564511487.0,"Noice! This is my setup atm and i was thinking of stopping here tbh. I enjoyed learning about audio, and my first experince with open back headphones was pretty epic (SHP9500) but i dont think the higher end stuff is for me. 

The bass on those cans are so deep and thumpy without being too dark and overpowering. I also got the Skullcandy Crushers for STOOPID amounts of fun bass, they're alot darker compared to the Fidelios."

simpleliving,err0vmt,t3_c3box4,1561157154.0,You could build a PC and get one of those mini itx cases.

Simple living for me has always been cutting out the extra stuff so I can afford the things I really want and need
