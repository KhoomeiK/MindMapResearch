I might not know what you’re going through, but I’ve been in a similar situation. And trust me, I’m glad I didn’t go through with it because I would’ve missed my high school graduation, my parents marriage, my 18th birthday and so much more. Don’t end your life be you someone, you are stronger than that urge. It might be tough, but overtime you’ll get through it and you’ll realize the many things you would’ve passed out on if you weren’t there. I know this whole situation is hard to deal with and if you ever need someone to talk to, then feel free to dm me. I really hope you don’t go through with this, there are much better days ahead"

The whole school was devastated because he was a sophomore and he was starting to become a better student. I didn’t know him that much, but he texted me on Facebook and I never responded. I regret not getting to know him, I’m sure he was a nice person. On a Friday the whole school hosted an event to remember him. They played videos and had pictures of him and his friends. It made us cry because of the future he could’ve had it only his  family had a smoke detector."

They told me to repeat the order and then they told me that it was wrong. I talked to my manager, so I can make some adjustments to their order. They completely changed their order and told me to repeat it again, I did and they started yelling at me saying if I was “deaf” and if I couldn’t hear them clearly.

I’m in college and meeting people isn’t always easy. One thing my friend does is ask someone “what was the hw”, even if you already know. Or give them a compliment, it can go a long way. It’s not going to work every time and not everyone is going to have something similar to you, but it’s the effort that matters."
