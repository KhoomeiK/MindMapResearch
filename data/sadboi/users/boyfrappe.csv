======

**About Me:**

Sweet like bananas, spicy like cinnamon, and creamy like coconut milk, I'm a lovely companion no matter the occasion. 

I stand out wherever I go. People can immediately tell that I'm definitely a Greenwich Village resident that studies art or dance. (To see if you've gotten this far, guess what I'm studying in college right now. There's five right answers 😃)

I love museums - art, science, history, doesn't matter. I love going to book stores and seeing all the things I would like to read. I love going to art stores and looking at supplies I may need for upcoming projects. I love going to tea houses and cafes and talking about anything. I'm a pretty simple girl with simple, lowkey interests. I can be fun - people have had the misfortune of being around me when I'm fun - but I prefer simplicity and passive experiences rather than action. Like the sea.

**Seeking**

I'm not a complex person. I'll spend time with you and, in return, I expect someone who wants to see the flower blossom in the springtime. You don't have to fall in love, but you do have to want to see me succeed and I'll do the same for you. I'll respect the boundaries of your life that you set up as long as you respect mine. 

Splenda men and salt daddies need not apply. 

You are always free to inquire about the status of one of my projects and I will always be willing to show you what I'm working on, what I'd like to do, and where I'd like to go. Your input is especially appreciated (since this is where most of your money will be going). 

And, to see if you've read this far, tell me about the last book you've read 😃"

AskTruFemcels,fc14moi,t3_ef2h5m,1577308128.0,"I'm autistic. I was diagnosed in 2014 – right around when the DSM was getting changed. 

I don't expect a relationship with me to be easy. I can't read facial expressions, body language, understand subtext (and this is *despite* me being a writer). I use language in a very... different way and being multilingual (as (a) special interest(s) and also culturally) probably doesn't help me. I just hope that the person who is cursed to end up with me is ready for someone who doesn't understand a goddamn thing about anything except what interests me and would literally rather just be in my bed (disabledcel also) and reading about what interests me and learning new random facts."
AskTruFemcels,fc14eh6,t3_efajea,1577307940.0,"Honestly? I try not to. I just push on in a life I don't really want to live, in a place I can't even afford to live (big EC city), around people who will never understand me. I have about... one good friend. One that I can't bear to lose. And I'm so afraid of losing them. I want to keep pushing on to keep experiencing them and their life and hopefully experience real love from a person I can actually touch, but it all feels like it's for nothing and I don't want to keep living like this anymore."
AskTruFemcels,fc145t7,t3_ef8dz7,1577307743.0,"I don't know what it's based on, but it's literally happened to me. A girl I was into and finally asked out lied to and cheated on me with a guy. This was last year. I haven't been right since. 

I want to get over it, over her, find someone new. But every time I think there's someone... there's no one. And I'm alone. Again."
Judaism,f8k557c,t3_e0litk,1574607506.0,"This Shabbat my mom was in the hospital because our neighbor's dog bit her. She's out now, but she's in a lot of pain so I spent Shabbat taking care of her. 

I started a new med and so far it's going great. 

Despite Shabbat being made for ceasing our daily labors and remaining in the moment in joy and love, I had to work on some assignments for school because I'm super far behind and I'd like to pass this semester. 

I cannot wait for next Shabbat."

Bedbugs,f7cjge4,t3_dveo96,1573593583.0,"Super likely. If no one (family, other staff, etc.) has already, you have to report that to the health department. That is a hazard to not only the individuals' health and wellbeing, but yours and everyone else's."
Bedbugs,f7chkaq,t3_dvfrlm,1573592402.0,Anywhere and everywhere.
Bedbugs,f7cga0s,t3_dvar2x,1573591618.0,It is.
Bedbugs,f7cg6u2,t3_dv4blf,1573591562.0,I am so sorry you have to deal with this. It's embarrassing and even *more* embarrassing when you see one crawling on you in public.
seizures,f5pcd48,t3_dmtbmv,1572355742.0,"Yes! I have multiple instances of déjà vu every day and it's scary every time. Mine change a lot, but I have no solid proof that it's actually a seizure since I don't know what happens next. 

(If this makes no sense, I had another seizure as I try to answer this.)"
