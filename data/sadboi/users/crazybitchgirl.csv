BPD,fr30z6z,t3_gm6hvm,1589847756.0,"I always experienced it as my ""personality"" is like play doh. It changes shape constantly and very much depends on who I am talking to.

Surprisingly I had a large number of people i hung out with in college, from a wide range of subjects such as biomedical, engineering, various sciences, business and arts. It was obvious to my close friends at the time that my personality switched depending on which group I was talking to, and this was pointed out to me occasionally. I had no real solid interests or likes or dislikes. I remember being 7 and being unsure what to say if I was asked what my favourite  *insert thing here* was, and I would usually pick the answer that the majority around me liked.  I actually wrote down a list of things that people talked about and literally decided on what I will say my favourite is. I had no favourites of anything but I felt excluded if I didn't say I did. I even rehearsed it.

In counciling I I kinda realised it was kind of a knee jerk reaction to being raised by my emotionally abusive family. I had to quickly adapt to whatever was expected of me and agree with them constantly. For example if they got me a yellow jacket I had to like it even if the thing was ugly. Then suddenly my favourite colour is yellow until the next change.

I still dont have very many solid likes or dislikes, but I am more aware of my personality shifts around people, with my close friends I am able to assert ""myself"" more if that makes any sense? I feel able to disagree and dislike stuff. Like I dislike burritos and I like pasta, but before I would just get a burrito if everyone else got one.

No. Because that is ridiculous.

OP cant help the name they are born with and it likely has nothing to do with the genocidal oppressor. Do you think anyone with the last name Lanza should be insulted? How about the last name Little? Theres any god awful number of atrocious people past present and future with last names, and people happening to share that name doesn't mean they deserve to be disrespected."

He wasnt using it until OP started paying for it to be heated. If he wants to use the pool heated, he should pay for it. Simple."

Honestly the way I see it is that the sorority is promoting racist behaviour. You not paying for her sorority dues is just essentially not paying for her racism membership. You are still paying for her college and she should be grateful for that.

If she wants to be a racist she should pay for it herself."

I was in the same situation. When I was 19 my grandfather had an accident. The next morning I was asked by my parents to move in with him as he was stubborn and they wanted someone to keep an eye on him.

I had a good relationship with him. But being a caretaker is hard. It can be traumatic and it changes your life in many ways. You end up planning around them. No sudden plans, no mildly irresponsible behaviour (drinking alcohol).

One of the worst memories is when I had cooked dinner and went to the living room beside the kitchen, as he wanted to read the paper there before joining me. About twenty minutes went by and I went to check on him to find him sitting up, eyes closed, not moving. He had fallen asleep sitting up but for those 60 seconds until I saw his chest move I thought he died and fully blamed myself for being in the next room.

You would be taking care of her financially with the original plan. She would have qualified people to take care of her. She could even be with her husband. But like my grandfather its difficult for older people to accept that they need help. She might come around in time but its truly for the best that you don't become her carer."

Pretty sure they had the concept of ""dont mess with other peoples things"" when she was growing up.

Also it's not materialism. She messed with and damaged his personal property. It being technology or costing 200 dollars doesnt matter. She doesnt even have the ""it's my house"" excuse because it was at OPs parents house.

She went out of her way to mess with his stuff breaking it in the process."
