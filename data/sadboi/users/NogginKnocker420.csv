Anxiety,flx0ndx,t1_fltk8ow,1585571862.0,"I feel for your husband. I’ve also seen the cardiologist and the ENT for the same exact “issues”. Just like your husband everything came back fine, but even though the rest results came back perfectly normal i still think i have these issues. I know it’s probably exhausting for you to deal with this stuff but just know everything that your husband feels is real in his head. It’s not over exaggerating, it really does feel like something is wrong with you."

AskReddit,fc57qrn,t3_ega7j6,1577447535.0,"My family was on vacation when I was about 10 years old. We had just got done swimming in the hotel that we were staying at. Me and my brothers were sharing a room. My younger brother was already changing out of his trunks in the bathroom so I decided to change out of mine near the entrance of the room. My older brother decided it would be funny to push me out of the hotel room while I was fully naked. I stood out in the hallway, covering my parts and standing in the corner. I was so traumatized that I didn’t make any noise. I just stood there for about 5-10 minutes in complete silence until a whole family of about 4 or 5 walked by and saw me and returned me to my parents next door."

AskReddit,ex8aphc,t1_ex66tjx,1566070985.0,"I live in illinois and used to work in Caseys. *A gas station line in the midwest that also has a kitchen, most famous for pizza and their donuts* Every night there are left over donuts. Like about 40-50 left over. We had to throw them out every night. And if you ate any or tried to take them home you would get fired. If we mess up on pizza like put a wrong topping on it, it immediately would get thrown away. Left over food in the warmers would get thrown away. It pissed me off so much throwing away good food. I eventually got used to it but after about 2 years it still bothered me every time i saw a good piece of food thrown in the trash."
AskReddit,ex80pcm,t3_crc4n7,1566067233.0,"I was about 11 or 12. It was sometime in November, so all the pumpkins my mom had left over for halloween were thrown in the cornfield behind my house. Me, my brothers and the neighbor kids were out playing in the cornfield. I spotted one of the pumpkins and kicked it as hard as I could thinking it would be soft and rotten. *wearing just socks and sandals* I immediately felt a shock go through my whole foot and fell to the ground and started scream crying while my older brother just started dying of laughter. I made my way back to the house and took my sock off and my whole big toe was purple and black and was already the size of a golf ball. I ended up sitting out of basketball for half of the season."
AskReddit,ev0tkyb,t3_chwcm8,1564146327.0,"I got my wisdom teeth removed last year. It was my first time ever getting put under and I was freaking out. I don’t know if i’m immune to anesthesia or what, but after they hooked me up it took about 15 minutes for me to go under. I woke up I think three times during the surgery. All i remember is hearing my heart rate on the monitor going extremely fast and my arm looked purple. I don’t know if they knew i was up or not but I heard one of the nurses say “should be stop the surgery” and i swear i heard the doctor say “No he’ll PROBABLY be fine” I started panicking and i heard the doctor say “push more of *whatever medicine*” and that’s all i remember."
