Every five seconds, the main gun of an Everest-class Dreadnought accelerates one to 1.3 percent of light speed. It impacts with the force of a 38-kiloton bomb. That is three times the yield of the city buster dropped on Hiroshima back on Earth. That means: Sir Isaac Newton is the deadliest son-of-a-bitch in space! (...) I dare to assume you ignorant jackasses know that space is empty! Once you fire this hunk of metal, it keeps going 'till it hits something! That can be a ship, or the planet behind that ship. It might go off into deep space and hit somebody else in ten thousand years. If you pull the trigger on this, you are ruining someone's day, somewhere and sometime!""

I spend a good hour there doing the write up and the whole time she is going on about how she feels unsafe in her own home (very common  conversation and honestly who wouldn't?). I notice she is very religious and conservative politically (she had a MAGA hat on her table). I don't think much of it since I am there to do a job not judge people.  When I get done we sit down so I can go over my recommendations. She stops me me just before I start my pitch and tells me that it is important to her to do business with right minded people and asks me if I voted for Trump. I have a no politics policy when I work because it is so divisive that no good comes of it. I explain to her that I don't share politics at work but I assure her I can help her with regards to security. She freaks out on me claiming that I am here to bug her house for the Democrats and runs me out of there before I can say anything else. She then calls my boss to say she was onto us and to not come back. I guess she didn't need piece of mind when she had already lost hers to begin with."
