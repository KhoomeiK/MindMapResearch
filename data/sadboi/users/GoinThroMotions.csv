BPD,filnag7,t3_f8f2uv,1582505643.0,"Maybe try couples therapy if you can? I agree communication is very important.  But I have a partner that is hard to communicate stuff with, especially mental health issues, so I understand how it might not be easy to bring up or actually talk to someone about. 

I have intimacy issues as well, I‚Äôm very back and forth between hyper sexual and not feeling it at all.   And when my partner wants it and I don‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt seem to say no or stick to it because I feel like I‚Äôll be abandoned or rejected if I do.  Or that they will cheat on me because I‚Äôm not giving it up.    It‚Äôs very scary circumstances for me and it makes me feel not good at all.  

I‚Äôm sorry about your ex, it sounds like you might have ptsd from the encounter and it‚Äôs a difficult thing to navigate (intimacy) with that on your mind.     This is why I‚Äôd maybe suggest couples therapy, because you deserve to tackle these traumatic issues with a therapist yourself and it might be easier to open up with your partner in a environment you feel is more therapeutic and accepting / understanding of what the trauma meant to you and how it still effects you.

I had something similar happen quite a few times in high school, getting tricked into a room to ‚Äújust talk‚Äù only to have the police or paramedics show up to cart me off to involuntary in-patient.   


I think if you just go to your doctor and explain you don‚Äôt find the therapy helpful and didn‚Äôt know how to express it, that you have dbt plans in the near future (plans are always a good indicator that you probably won‚Äôt kill yourself atm, clinically speaking that is), and plan on continuing other treatments for now... you should be ok?    


I assume that you have had them communicate in the past and that‚Äôs how they might know how to contact each other? This treatment teams job is to ensure your stability and safety, and if you just plan on ghosting therapy after making suicidal comments, they might just want to be sure you are really ok.   

It‚Äôs a good sign the police just didn‚Äôt show up out of the blue imo, and that they are making you be ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù to show up on your own to see him for a check in.  


I think if you just reiterate everything you said here you should be ok?  But no one can really promise you either way.  


I think the top comment that you already replied to is also a solid response and view, I just wanted to chime in on this so you don‚Äôt feel unjustified in your paranoia, but also try to offer some possible reassurance that even if it is a ‚Äúset up‚Äù, it might not end up as horrible as you are probably worried about.  


It‚Äôs really hard to be open and honest with these professionals when you are worried they can just lock you up and throw away the key... I really do get that.

Relationships are complicated beasts and are not always perfect and have their hiccups and speed bumps as it were, and surely a post of venting isn‚Äôt the whole picture. 

But I think it‚Äôs a dangerous slippery slope some of this stuff, and in my insecure opinion, I would almost wonder if he saw these sex talks as flirting and a possible window to pursue said friend.   It‚Äôs hard to really grasp even a whiff of what‚Äôs actually going on from a vent post... and I do admit I can be a bit more paranoid then some lol.  

Its wonderful he makes you feel loved and tells you how beautiful you are!  I would really just suggest you have a talk with him about your feelings and where your head is at, and see how he responds and validates you...

I‚Äôd also like to say that it‚Äôs ok to not have the same exact sexual fantasy‚Äôs, what‚Äôs important is that you both make efforts where you can, and focus on each others needs for a enjoyable experience that satisfies both parties.        

I know it‚Äôs hard to be satisfied with oneself when you feel you can‚Äôt be or achieve something, sometimes more so when it‚Äôs for someone you care about vs yourself, but that doesn‚Äôt take away from being unique and special as a individual, and that you too as is bring something special to the table. 

And even if you can‚Äôt meet a couple fantasy‚Äôs head on, maybe you can meet others that you both can enjoy.   


I know it‚Äôs not a good feeling, inadequacy.  But try not to be too hard on yourself on the basis of what others might be able to do. 


As for being poly in a monog, and will it work... that‚Äôs probably a choice one has to want to stick with, much like being bi in a monog relationship.       Relationships take ALOT of work, and communication.

The only times I get really scared and don‚Äôt necessarily, is when I‚Äôm high from weed, or love.   Then the idea of death really scares the shit out of me for a short time.   Then it‚Äôs back to normal and just hoping I don‚Äôt have to feel it happening.   


I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs normal, because when I try to talk about it and express myself people like to try and divert the conversation or be positive for things they don‚Äôt experience.  


I‚Äôm sorry you feel like dying.  It‚Äôs a shitty feeling."
BPD,f8r2ect,t3_e1li4c,1574730259.0,"I don‚Äôt have any real advice, I‚Äôm on disability personally, and this is a living hell for me tbh. 

Sometimes if I save up enough I‚Äôll get a little bit of weed so I can feel happy for a short time. 

I just feel like I‚Äôm waiting to die and wondering if I should just do it myself all the time.  Year after year.  


It‚Äôs hard to deal with and depressing it can‚Äôt really be talked about with anyone, most people don‚Äôt get it, and I just feel like the odd one out in life. 


I try to give myself activity scheduals even if it‚Äôs stupid and I don‚Äôt usually enjoy it.  Like a game I tend to frequent has 3 daily missions a day, I try to make sure I attempt or complete all 3 even if just playing something I know I enjoy is a struggle and just kinda frustrating.  It‚Äôs so odd even after a lifetime of dealing with it differently to know you like and enjoy something, and yet not like it or enjoy it.  


I feel like the guy from the outer limits or twilight zone who just wanted to read, and by the end he is all alone with all the books and time to read and then his glasses break and he can‚Äôt do shit.  


But yeah, I try to do the routine thing.  I‚Äôm just so bored  and lonely.  I have plenty to do, and a relationship, and all the time in the world. Yet I‚Äôm painfully bored and alone.  And got broken up with last time I was vocal about how I feel, so I just suffer silently now to keep the relationship going since we got back together. And like I said, I just don‚Äôt think people get it.  

I‚Äôm almost in my mid thirties and I just find this getting progressively worse since I was younger.  


I‚Äôve considered maybe making friends, since I do lack in this department, but I live far away from where o grew up, and the few times over the last few years that I did have friend groups, they landed on the more conservative or narcissistic side of things and I kinda just cut them off....  

I would however suggest friends, if you can find a supportive group.  Finding a hobby with a group of people can help, just try to make sure you are not on so morally different if you can help it.  Some activities I suppose it doesn‚Äôt matter much, but when you hang out with people who‚Äôs beliefs come across as hateful or bigoted, it won‚Äôt matter how much you enjoy watching that tv show with or pokehunting with them, cause eventually discussions of ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù can surface and issues can form.   Or maybe you are the type that isn‚Äôt as liberal and such a group would suit you idk lol.    Just make sure you are being supported and not invalidated on your existence!!! 



I‚Äôve considered traveling and living out of a backpack or something, but I think that‚Äôs just me day dreaming of greener grass vs something realistic for me.   But it‚Äôs a nice thought and might work for someone less anxious. 


Art I think helps people a bit, writing or drawing or something.  Lots of other mediums to do, but again you might struggle to find enjoyment in it or anything else I suggest.   


I just honestly haven‚Äôt found anything helpful other then weed, which I don‚Äôt do much anymore, and I‚Äôm not sure self medication is a solution, just a temporary escape.  But it‚Äôs nice to not feel so empty.  

Im just so worn out and tired all the time with everything and nothing to do :/

Sorry this is all rather drawn out and over shared, but I know it sucks and I‚Äôm genuinely sorry you are suffering as well from it.    I‚Äôm sure you have tried all I‚Äôve suggested, but maybe something will work ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I just hope that maybe once you find a way to get into a healthy socialization group maybe things will look better.

I personally have not done this because of anxiety and the group I was after didn‚Äôt exist in my area (was looking for bpd group/friends) , but if you can do so, at least looking at the website won‚Äôt hurt

I understand the ‚Äúeveryone pays for their own food‚Äù bit, but if you and your mom have your own thing going on with it, I would just maybe ask her, or apologize and explain you were joking and didn‚Äôt mean to offend her, gauge her response maybe from that?  

I used to cry a lot as a child, still do at times when I‚Äôm alone, and the occasional glance up from my food certainly was a cause from a short lived foster home... so I understand how attacked and anxious this sort of response must make you.... 

Is your step dad abusive or something? Why would your mom act different around him?   I don‚Äôt mean to pry too much, but it just seems like a odd/cruel response for someone to just hit you only when someone else is around... you don‚Äôt deserve that.
