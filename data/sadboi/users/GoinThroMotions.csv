BPD,filnag7,t3_f8f2uv,1582505643.0,"Maybe try couples therapy if you can? I agree communication is very important.  But I have a partner that is hard to communicate stuff with, especially mental health issues, so I understand how it might not be easy to bring up or actually talk to someone about. 

I have intimacy issues as well, I’m very back and forth between hyper sexual and not feeling it at all.   And when my partner wants it and I don’t, I can’t seem to say no or stick to it because I feel like I’ll be abandoned or rejected if I do.  Or that they will cheat on me because I’m not giving it up.    It’s very scary circumstances for me and it makes me feel not good at all.  

I’m sorry about your ex, it sounds like you might have ptsd from the encounter and it’s a difficult thing to navigate (intimacy) with that on your mind.     This is why I’d maybe suggest couples therapy, because you deserve to tackle these traumatic issues with a therapist yourself and it might be easier to open up with your partner in a environment you feel is more therapeutic and accepting / understanding of what the trauma meant to you and how it still effects you.

You mention a med transition, so you are in treatment? Perhaps you can schedule a “emergency” doctor appointment and get your doctor involved in your thought process and of their opinion if going to the hospital is for you? 

It’s might be good for you, it can help you take a step back from the chaos in your life atm and give yourself a breather.

I had something similar happen quite a few times in high school, getting tricked into a room to “just talk” only to have the police or paramedics show up to cart me off to involuntary in-patient.   


I think if you just go to your doctor and explain you don’t find the therapy helpful and didn’t know how to express it, that you have dbt plans in the near future (plans are always a good indicator that you probably won’t kill yourself atm, clinically speaking that is), and plan on continuing other treatments for now... you should be ok?    


I assume that you have had them communicate in the past and that’s how they might know how to contact each other? This treatment teams job is to ensure your stability and safety, and if you just plan on ghosting therapy after making suicidal comments, they might just want to be sure you are really ok.   

It’s a good sign the police just didn’t show up out of the blue imo, and that they are making you be “responsible” to show up on your own to see him for a check in.  


I think if you just reiterate everything you said here you should be ok?  But no one can really promise you either way.  


I think the top comment that you already replied to is also a solid response and view, I just wanted to chime in on this so you don’t feel unjustified in your paranoia, but also try to offer some possible reassurance that even if it is a “set up”, it might not end up as horrible as you are probably worried about.  


It’s really hard to be open and honest with these professionals when you are worried they can just lock you up and throw away the key... I really do get that.

BPD,ffjoufr,t1_ffjn4me,1580003252.0,"Well if you can articulate how you are feeling and how these issues exactly effect you, and it’s well received and respected, then I don’t see why not...

Relationships are complicated beasts and are not always perfect and have their hiccups and speed bumps as it were, and surely a post of venting isn’t the whole picture. 

But I think it’s a dangerous slippery slope some of this stuff, and in my insecure opinion, I would almost wonder if he saw these sex talks as flirting and a possible window to pursue said friend.   It’s hard to really grasp even a whiff of what’s actually going on from a vent post... and I do admit I can be a bit more paranoid then some lol.  

Its wonderful he makes you feel loved and tells you how beautiful you are!  I would really just suggest you have a talk with him about your feelings and where your head is at, and see how he responds and validates you...

I’d also like to say that it’s ok to not have the same exact sexual fantasy’s, what’s important is that you both make efforts where you can, and focus on each others needs for a enjoyable experience that satisfies both parties.        

I know it’s hard to be satisfied with oneself when you feel you can’t be or achieve something, sometimes more so when it’s for someone you care about vs yourself, but that doesn’t take away from being unique and special as a individual, and that you too as is bring something special to the table. 

And even if you can’t meet a couple fantasy’s head on, maybe you can meet others that you both can enjoy.   


I know it’s not a good feeling, inadequacy.  But try not to be too hard on yourself on the basis of what others might be able to do. 


As for being poly in a monog, and will it work... that’s probably a choice one has to want to stick with, much like being bi in a monog relationship.       Relationships take ALOT of work, and communication.   


Maybe write him a note about your feelings if you have trouble articulating it with words or face to face.

It’s wonderful that you have such passion to help others.

I too worry about being homeless and falling in between the cracks...  all it would take is being put second again and boom, possibly homeless.

Like a game I tend to frequent has 3 daily missions a day, I try to make sure I attempt or complete all 3 even if just playing something I know I enjoy is a struggle and just kinda frustrating.  It’s so odd even after a lifetime of dealing with it differently to know you like and enjoy something, and yet not like it or enjoy it.  


I feel like the guy from the outer limits or twilight zone who just wanted to read, and by the end he is all alone with all the books and time to read and then his glasses break and he can’t do shit.  


But yeah, I try to do the routine thing.  I’m just so bored  and lonely.  I have plenty to do, and a relationship, and all the time in the world. Yet I’m painfully bored and alone.  And got broken up with last time I was vocal about how I feel, so I just suffer silently now to keep the relationship going since we got back together. And like I said, I just don’t think people get it.  

I’m almost in my mid thirties and I just find this getting progressively worse since I was younger.  


I’ve considered maybe making friends, since I do lack in this department, but I live far away from where o grew up, and the few times over the last few years that I did have friend groups, they landed on the more conservative or narcissistic side of things and I kinda just cut them off....  

I would however suggest friends, if you can find a supportive group.  Finding a hobby with a group of people can help, just try to make sure you are not on so morally different if you can help it.  Some activities I suppose it doesn’t matter much, but when you hang out with people who’s beliefs come across as hateful or bigoted, it won’t matter how much you enjoy watching that tv show with or pokehunting with them, cause eventually discussions of “substance” can surface and issues can form.   Or maybe you are the type that isn’t as liberal and such a group would suit you idk lol.    Just make sure you are being supported and not invalidated on your existence!!! 



I’ve considered traveling and living out of a backpack or something, but I think that’s just me day dreaming of greener grass vs something realistic for me.   But it’s a nice thought and might work for someone less anxious. 


Art I think helps people a bit, writing or drawing or something.  Lots of other mediums to do, but again you might struggle to find enjoyment in it or anything else I suggest.   


I just honestly haven’t found anything helpful other then weed, which I don’t do much anymore, and I’m not sure self medication is a solution, just a temporary escape.  But it’s nice to not feel so empty.  

Im just so worn out and tired all the time with everything and nothing to do :/

Sorry this is all rather drawn out and over shared, but I know it sucks and I’m genuinely sorry you are suffering as well from it.    I’m sure you have tried all I’ve suggested, but maybe something will work 🤷‍♂️

I just hope that maybe once you find a way to get into a healthy socialization group maybe things will look better.  

As long as you are old enough, maybe trying MeetUp site can help you find a group for a activity you already like to do, but with people who also want to do so in a group.    

I personally have not done this because of anxiety and the group I was after didn’t exist in my area (was looking for bpd group/friends) , but if you can do so, at least looking at the website won’t hurt

I struggle with any actual advice to give you since I struggle with fixation at times myself and either can’t get a person or thought out of my head and obsess over it, and in all the ways I can.     


It’s been a really really shitty time for you and I do wish I had more constructive of a comment to give you.  

You didn’t/don’t deserve most of that negativity that’s been in your life, certainly so as of late, and I just want you to know that it isn’t your fault, people (even ourselves at times) can be really shitty, and I think you just have unfortunately been having to deal with that on your plate... 

I think you should find someone you feel safe and trust and just get a big hug, I know that’s not much of a solution, but sometimes they can really help, even if for a moment in time.

I understand the “everyone pays for their own food” bit, but if you and your mom have your own thing going on with it, I would just maybe ask her, or apologize and explain you were joking and didn’t mean to offend her, gauge her response maybe from that?  

I used to cry a lot as a child, still do at times when I’m alone, and the occasional glance up from my food certainly was a cause from a short lived foster home... so I understand how attacked and anxious this sort of response must make you.... 

Is your step dad abusive or something? Why would your mom act different around him?   I don’t mean to pry too much, but it just seems like a odd/cruel response for someone to just hit you only when someone else is around... you don’t deserve that.

Thank you 

I hope you are able to make more friends who are supportive despite your attempts to temporarily space yourself from them. 

Have you told them you do this? Or are they just used to it?   Maybe it would help you if you talked about it, or maybe it wouldn’t since then you wouldn’t feel better and want to rebound when you do push them away.  

It sucks being dramatic and not even trying to be... so confusing, from my perspective about myself at times at least"

Socializing make me feel uncomfortable tho, but I probably should try more.  It’s just usually so exhausting, tho it’s not like isolation isn’t exhausting too, I just kinda wanna save people and myself my issues.  

Plus people are so invalidating, at least the last friend group I dipped a toe into was, I just dont kno where to begin to find people understanding to the mentally ill and supportive.   It’s usually the “just get over it” “I was sad once, and it was way worse then you” kinda bs... so it’s either I get to hang around and have my existence devalued and invalidated, or wait till I flip out on the inconsiderate people in some dramatic explosion.  

No thanks...



But I hope that, maybe one day, I will belong, and feel it too.  I doubt it, but I hope."
