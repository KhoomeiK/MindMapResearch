Cartalk,f2cxmrl,t1_f2cwror,1570144145.0,OK thanks. I'll grease them after work tomorrow. Is there a certain grease you would recommend using?
Cartalk,f2cw2eu,t1_f2cvnsc,1570143598.0,Thanks for the reply. I will grease them ASAP but right now it's raining and I have to leave for work at 6:30 am. Need to drive about 45 miles each way to work. Will I be OK or is that going to cause a problem?
Cartalk,f25xchf,t1_f25g4d5,1569986300.0,Thanks for your help. I was confused because I had created grooves inside the bolt hole that looked like threads when I forced the bolt in with my impact. I didn't realize it until I looked at the opposite side and saw that there were no threads. All I had to do was clean the bolt hole up a bit with a screwdriver. Turns out the new control arms came with new pinch bolts with lock washers. I finally finished the job tonight but after seeing your comment I realized that I forgot to use loctite on the pinch bolts. Should I go back in and put some on or will it be OK?
Cartalk,f24pbxe,t1_f24odfs,1569957373.0,"So I just looked at the passenger side and there aren't any threads inside the hole. It just looks like there's threads in the driver's side hole because I tried to force it in with my impact and created grooves. I think all I need to do now is get a new bolt from Nissan and I should be all set. 

To avoid messing up the new bolt is there a certain method to getting the bolt past the groove in the middle of the hole?"
Cartalk,f24n03d,t1_f24jqfz,1569955927.0,Yeah it's hard to get a good picture of it. The threads are mostly still intact but they are kind of shredded in places.
Cartalk,f24mvxt,t1_f24jdjq,1569955857.0,I tried just using the same bolt and nut from the other side and it won't go through.
Cartalk,f24j9dh,t1_f24j6hu,1569953415.0,Yes

MechanicAdvice,f1o9iec,t1_f1o8tu6,1569638362.0,I didn't break the axle nut loose and I know that the ball joint bolt is capable of going into the knuckle because after I couldnt get everything seated this way I tried doing the ball joint first and it went in. Thanks though
MechanicAdvice,f1o8cdx,t1_f1o60si,1569637428.0,"Yeah I think if anything the ""bolt"" needs to be angled in towards the car. I have to work all day tomorrow but I'll be tackling this again on Sunday. I'll try to snap some pics and post them. Thanks for your help."
MechanicAdvice,f1o5ser,t1_f1o52m9,1569635412.0,"I sort of misspoke in my OP. I was able to get both frame bolts in loosely and line up the ball joint but it wouldn't go in. I moved it in all different directions, hit it with a hammer, tried jacking the knuckle up at different heights, WD40 etc. It just would not slide into the knuckle."
MechanicAdvice,f1o4lzu,t1_f1o03o8,1569634510.0,Would it make sense to just take the strut out then install the control arm and reinstall the strut? The strut is brand new so it shouldn't be hard to take out.
MechanicAdvice,f1o4dew,t1_f1nymk5,1569634324.0,"I tried that and was able to line up the ball joint stud with the knuckle but it wouldn't go in. I wrestled with it for at least an hour. Tried multiple different angles, tried hitting it with a hammer, Wd40 etc but no dice."

TBI,eyyuem6,t3_czjezh,1567602086.0,"I'd suggest trying CBD, it has helped my anxiety tremendously. I vape a strain of high CBD hemp flower called Special Sauce and it destroys my anxiety. You could also just get some CBD tincture and take a few drops under your tongue when you're feeling anxious.

hempflowers,evo72cr,t1_evo3v1z,1564639947.0,+1 for Sandman's Dream from Finger Lakes. It's the best strain I've found for sleep. Prior to that it was Sour Space Candy from Apical Greens but they are out of stock until after the harvest.
MortalKombat,errsoyg,t3_c2c8kj,1561181831.0,"**edit** I figured it out. I just exited out of MK11 by pressing the home button then hovered over the MK11 icon, pressed start, then quit. When I reopened the game the Kombat League was there. 


I have the same problem. Glad it's not just me. Anybody know how to fix this?"
AskReddit,erjf4sd,t3_c2d4fv,1560926615.0,Sour Space Candy. It's a strain of high CBD hemp. It has a high quantity of a terpene called myrcene in it. I've struggled with insomnia for my entire adult life and have tried everything. This is the only thing that will knock me out and the best part is there are no side effects. I just vape a little bit and I'm out within 30 minutes. You can get it legally online from many different vendors. The best I've found is called Apical Greens. I hope this helps.
