sandiego,fr050ji,t1_fr02sp4,1589783940.0,"Okay so imagine this was how we did it, only old people and those with preexisting conditions stayed home. So they‚Äôd still need groceries right? They‚Äôd still need to eat. They‚Äôd still need to maybe walk their dogs or in some cases go to work. But let‚Äôs say that they don‚Äôt need those things because they‚Äôre not essential, but they do still need groceries right?

So if everyone else isn‚Äôt on lockdown and someone who is older or at risk of dying from the virus went to the store, and everything was normal, they are interacting with not only everyone who has been in that store that day but also everyone who has interacted with them. 

Think of how your life was two months ago. How many people would you say you interact with in a regular two week period? For me, and I‚Äôm an introvert with almost no friends, I probably go to the playground with my daughter 4-5 times a week, go to class once a week, go to the library 3 times a week, go to the grocery twice a week, I have a communal laundry room I do laundry twice a week, usually we‚Äôll go out to dinner once a week, I shop at places like target and Michael‚Äôs and the dollar store once every couple of weeks, I go on walks in my neighborhood or hiking almost every day, I usually will go to my moms house once a week, I see my husbands family once or twice a week, my daughter goes to daycare sometimes, Sunday school, etc, and my husband goes to work 4 days a week at an office with about 100 people. So in a two week period I probably interact with hundreds of people. Others probably much more than that. 

I haven‚Äôt been within 6 feet of anyone but my husband and my daughter in over two months. Neither have they. So, if I were to go to the grocery store, and interact with someone based on necessity, they would only have my germs they were interact with. 

Without the lockdown, when the elderly and the immunosuppressed go to get their groceries, they interact with all of us. And our likelihood of having covid-19 goes higher with the number of people we interact with. 

Not to mention, most immunosuppressed people live with others, and many elderly people live in homes. The workers at homes and hospitals would have to social distance so they wouldn‚Äôt be able to go anywhere. The families of the people at risk would have to social distance and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to work. Without the lockdown, they wouldn‚Äôt have unemployment to look at, they wouldn‚Äôt have stimulus checks, they wouldn‚Äôt have food banks, they would literally have to sit in their homes and never leave. It‚Äôs not plausible. 

We can make a small sacrifice because they matter too."

I am with a five year old every day for 14 hours with no breaks or help and I can‚Äôt take her to the park or to ride bikes. I know that this can take a toll on your mental health. I have chronic anxiety and depression and chronic pain and I have not been doing well stuck inside. I get it. It sucks! Like, really really sucks. 

But it doesn‚Äôt change things. If the lockdown were to end, we would have hundreds of thousands of deaths if not millions. 

The whole point of staying home is to save lives and not overrun hospitals. If we ended the lockdown, the hospitals would be full and people who wouldn‚Äôt have to die would die because of lack of space and equipment. 

Honestly your whole post and this comment come off as very spoiled and selfish. We ALL know it‚Äôs hard. Like you said, people with families have it harder, many people have been laid off. But guess what, we are sucking it up because we don‚Äôt only care about ourselves. 

The lockdown is to save lives. If you don‚Äôt understand how because you‚Äôre not an epidemiologist, fine, you don‚Äôt have to understand how.

Also, ‚Äúfear mongering towards older generations‚Äù yikes. A 4% death rate is huge the flu is .1% and older generations are dying much faster than younger people that‚Äôs not fear mongering it‚Äôs trying to protect them. 

Yes it sucks. It‚Äôs hard. I miss my family and friends too. We all do. We all want to go out. We all want to go to the beach. But this is a fucking epidemic. The closures were to flatten the curve. We have had almost 100,000 deaths and that‚Äôs with the lockdowns. If we were to just reopen then can you imagine how many we would have? The sooner we reopen the longer this will last. 

And you‚Äôre right, people aren‚Äôt following and it‚Äôs going to cause problems. Huge problems. Cities and counties and states are reopening and it‚Äôs going to just mean more lockdowns in a month. No, this isn‚Äôt being handled right - maybe if the federal government tested more and provided funding to citizens and hospitals it wouldn‚Äôt be like this. But the lockdowns are not the problem.

You‚Äôre really out here claiming that women should have gotten jobs anyway even though no one would hire women at the time, that women should have made better financial decisions even though most women weren‚Äôt allowed to go to college and had been told their entire lives that they would die if they didn‚Äôt have their husbands to support them.

Even today some girls are taught they should go to college to find a husband. And then by the time society changed and expected women to know how to fend for themselves, she was already a housewife with no skills or experience. Not sure if you‚Äôve ever tried to find a job and work when you‚Äôre in your forties or fifties and have never had a job before but I would say it‚Äôs next to impossible. It‚Äôs not her fault.

Edit: correction, she was 65 ten years ago so she would‚Äôve been twenty 55 years ago. Even worse. She was in high school in the late 50s/early 60s. Girls weren‚Äôt even allowed to wear pants back then. And women going to college in the 60s was super rare. If her husband was a veteran it‚Äôs very possible she married young and never had a job.

Nicegirls,fqb2yem,t3_ghvw8c,1589229663.0,"This is not hatred towards men. She is making the point that women do these things pretty often because they are trying to uphold western beauty standards that are put in place BY MEN. This isn‚Äôt nice girl at all, this is pointing out that these women are getting work done because they have been told they aren‚Äôt worthwhile human beings unless they are beautiful. And then there are men who give women shit for trying to appease them. It‚Äôs just that there are a lot of men who hate women. Welcome to the patriarchy."
niceguys,fqay2cw,t1_fqaxl5y,1589227255.0,"That‚Äôs fair, and I assumed that gray text was a dude because in my experience dudes who hate women are confused by other dudes following and supporting women. I didn‚Äôt think it had anything to do with jealousy."
niceguys,fqaxwn9,t1_fqaww5y,1589227178.0,I definitely don‚Äôt! Was just point out to those who were super mad about it lol
MurderedByWords,fqawogs,t1_fqanlal,1589226582.0,Thank you!!
niceguys,fqawgg2,t3_ght84g,1589226475.0,"Y‚Äôall I don‚Äôt know many women who have called other women thots or females so pretty sure gray text is a dude, if you‚Äôre confused and think you‚Äôre sure blue text is a dude, MAYBE YOURE FORGETTING GAY PEOPLE EXIST"

AmItheAsshole,fq84pnm,t3_ghc9uz,1589158455.0,Why are you with this person he sounds like an ass. And it doesn‚Äôt sound like communication works.
sandiego,fq82lxa,t3_ghctuv,1589157226.0,Usually places will be closed on 12/25 but still lots of public places you can go. The rest of your trip you will have lots to do and it will likely be very busy! Hope everything works out so you can come have fun!
sandiego,fq7grpr,t3_gh4hu3,1589146186.0,I just want to lay on the beach with a cooler full of drinks and a good book

TrollXChromosomes,fq6p5je,t1_fq6lb5v,1589135815.0,"I think due to how extremely common it is for women to get assaulted/raped it‚Äôs hard to watch because it‚Äôs so much more real. And sexual violence is psychological as well as physical. For me, watching someone get their head cut off or whatever is hard to watch cuz it‚Äôs gross and disturbing. But I‚Äôve never seen someone get their head cut off in real life, and it doesn‚Äôt happen very often. But every woman I know has been assaulted or raped. I‚Äôve been assaulted multiple times. 

And to your last point, we can‚Äôt control the things we get upset over or the things that trigger us. It makes no sense to say it‚Äôs not worth it to get upset over or we should also be upset about something else."
TrollXChromosomes,fq6i770,t1_fq6ewci,1589132009.0,Yes I definitely agree. When I stopped watching I looked it up and read about the male protagonist‚Äôs torture/rape and was so confused. I mean I guess good for them for bringing awareness to men being victims too but like. Can we just not? I feel it‚Äôs one thing to include a little of it to explain that it was a different time but it‚Äôs way too much. I would rather we get rid of sensationalist rape in tv altogether. Same reason I stopped watching 13 Reasons Why. Ugh it makes me sick to my stomach that we consider this entertainment.
TrollXChromosomes,fq6eocx,t1_fq6eah5,1589130064.0,I really wanted to like it
TrollXChromosomes,fq6ench,t1_fq6e7hu,1589130048.0,Exactly. I was so frustrated like do you not have any other way to show character development? No? Okay. I was really surprised! Ended up turning it off at like episode 9
TrollXChromosomes,fq6d6zr,t3_gh3jne,1589129249.0,I recently tried watching Outlander and was shocked by how much sexual violence was in it. I googled it and expected to find a bunch of people pissed about it but the show has only been praised by feminists for having real female characters. But it seemed disgusting to me. Much worse than game of thrones.
Coronavirus,fq6cujq,t1_fq67apd,1589129057.0,I‚Äôve always gotten the feeling that he knows he looks like a dork but he just likes his style and has zero shame in it. He seems like a genuinely great person. He supports small businesses and he is super positive and all around awesome. He‚Äôs one of my favorites
stepparents,fq5xpux,t3_gh0ezt,1589120110.0,"I feel that if anything your husband should have helped him navigate this. My SD acknowledged me but only because my husband had her make a card, and got her excited to wake up early to make breakfast. Growing up, my brothers didn‚Äôt ever do anything for anyone‚Äôs birthdays or mother‚Äôs or Father‚Äôs Day for either of our biological parents. Not because they didn‚Äôt recognize them as parents but because they were self involved kids who never thought to do anything for anyone. They needed reminders. All I‚Äôm trying to say is he might still view you as a parental figure, this is mostly just indicative of your SO not giving him a way to celebrate you"

sandiego,fq2k0tr,t3_ggj6oz,1589056879.0,This is my street :( I saw my neighbor circle the street 3-4 times because she couldn‚Äôt find parking. I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable taking my daughter for a walk because there are so many friggin people. Not wearing masks not social distancing.
politics,fq1pime,t1_fq1l5o4,1589047796.0,I‚Äôll definitely add it to my list. I do love an audiobook read by the author. Thank you!
politics,fq1gbh7,t1_fq1187m,1589045397.0,I don‚Äôt think you know what mental illness is. No one is responsible for having a mental illness. You can‚Äôt control it or make it go away. Sure you‚Äôre responsible for treatment but no. And having depression or anxiety or bipolar disorder or schizophrenia or autism or any other mental illness doesn‚Äôt make you behave horribly. Your whole comment is very ableist.
