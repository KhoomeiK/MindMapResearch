SkincareAddicts,fqkfkpw,t1_fqjkwao,1589426237.0,"Yeah! I take Dr. formulated CBD+DHA in the morning and natural stacks CBD with melatonin at night. Both doses are 15 mg each, which may seem like a lot but I’ve had a very good response to it and it’s helped my anxiety and sleep a lot— which may have contributed to skin improvement. On my face I’ve used Herbivore’s CBD + adaptogen serum which was very good on my skin but tbh wasn’t nearly as remarkable as the cbd caps. I now use a much more affordable serum that’s made by a friend of mine but I’m still very cautious with the ingredients. I’d definitely recommend Herbivore’s product if you have the $$ but any gentle and fragrance free serum should do the trick. Also forgot to mention: When I got my IUD put in, I got terrible cystic acne and my OBGYN recommended reishi mushroom which also made a substantial difference when my hormones were all whack. There’s not tons of evidence in the scientific community for reishi and skin clearing but there is evidence that it may have immune-boosting properties and I found it to be effective so I can’t knock it."
SkincareAddicts,fqjiwmw,t3_gj9kq5,1589410579.0,"I’m not a doctor, but from what I’ve been told, acne in this region is caused by hormones and/or reactions to fragrance you might be wearing (either as perfume or in your skincare). I’ve had a lot of luck clearing up my hormonal acne with cbd (ingested and in skincare) and vitamin e (topical only!) I also gave up gluten because I knew I had a sensitivity to it , (but continued to eat it anyway) and that helped a lot. That may or may not work for you but I would definitely recommend talking to a doctor/licensed professional if you have access because there can be many different causes to cystic acne.
Edit for clarity: my acne was caused by inflammation, so I took action to reduce inflammation and improve circulation— but yours could be like mine, a reaction to fragrance, or a hormonal imbalance or a combination of those. Please do try to look at a root cause before putting random products on your skin."
AskWomen,fqflm16,t3_gimi0y,1589327109.0,"Cheating can have a lot of nuance. My SO and I separated a year ago to get some space for 30 days for a variety of issues, but especially because I was severely depressed and didn’t realize it. I distinctly remember saying that I wouldn’t see anyone else in that time and him saying the same thing. 

Fast forward a month later and we decided we wanted to work things out. He is a bad liar, so I was able to get it out of him that he had kissed someone else. I was upset, but could get through it. Several weeks later (on my birthday) I brought it up again and asked why he was being so weird and evasive to more questions that I needed answers for. Well, as it turns out he slept with her multiple times that month. I was enraged and heartbroken and very angry for a long time. He insisted that he never said he wouldn’t see anyone else and that he felt really bad about it and was sorry. 

Previously, he was not at all the kind of dude to cheat and he was very loyal. I decided to give him a chance still and am quite happy with him. It was very painful to acknowledge that we may have had a miscommunication and there were other factors that led to what happened. It took lots of work and lots of therapy, but I do not believe that every cheater stays a cheater. He admitted his wrongdoing and has worked with me and supported me every step of the way. Admittedly, I am still working through some of my anger but have come to a place of forgiveness. (Forgive but don’t forget)."

mcgill,fq7fp7y,t3_gh49ns,1589145787.0,"It’s cliché but grades really aren’t a measure of success. Unless you’re planning on a prestigious grad, med, or legal program which many people at McGill seem to be shooting for- and even then there’s other scores and circumstances to be considered. I’m in a similar boat, and rest assured like other commenters have mentioned we’re in the majority. There are many successful McGill grads that had average or even low GPAs."
femalehairadvice,fpl3e3e,t1_fpi44dh,1588705658.0,Thank you!! I love the light auburn idea- I’ve never considered it. And yeah tight braids using the bangs is a good look I’ve found.
femalehairadvice,fpkzmy8,t1_fpi4icx,1588703793.0,Thanks! I like the 60s inspired idea. I’ve also really enjoyed taking biotin but apparently you wanna be careful to not take too much- at least that’s what my doc told me.
femalehairadvice,fpi1mog,t3_gdlsab,1588631890.0,"Title pretty much says it all. Hoping someone has any ideas for what to do with my hair? I can’t see a stylist because of quarantine rules in my state. I had cute baby bangs before but I don’t feel like bangs and the shag look really fit my face shape. I am so aggravated by how they’ve grown out and that they look so heavy! I do trim them a little to avoid split ends and promote growth but I’m really tired of this look and mostly being aware of them on my forehead. I have really fine hair, but a lot of it. Advice? Maybe a new color or even just a change in part?"
misophonia,fpfhu9y,t3_gc7foh,1588571690.0,"I literally just discovered Misophonia and I think it’s very probable I do have it. As I am reading some of these threads, I am crying because I never realized other people had these same experiences and I’d never met anyone like me in that regard. For so long I shamed myself and was shamed by others who didn’t get it, especially by my parents. 

It is surprisingly emotional to realize that you aren’t alone and that other people in the world experience it like you do. Ever since I was a kid I couldn’t sleep because my own heartbeat would keep me up or I’d get super angry over the quiet whispers of my parents in the room next door. Especially things like chewing certain foods make me feel really angry stressed, which I never understood. All of these little things that I just thought were “quirks” are real. I also never realized how out of my way I would go to avoid sounds or how much it really impacted me. I think the Misophonia is combined with a couple other sensory processing disorders, but I finally feel seen and feel like I can begin to help myself and maybe help others in awareness. 

Thanks to everyone on this sub for sharing their experiences, triggers, and tips and suggestions. I look forward to learning more. ❤️

Edit TLDR- my world feels like it finally makes sense."

mcgill,fm569bn,t1_flyajc4,1585767096.0,"English lit major here. I’d recommend going with something that you enjoyed in high school, even just for a bit. American lit (227) and Canadian lit (229) are probably safe intro courses. Admittedly I’ve never taken the intro courses specifically, but I really enjoyed the major version of both these classes. These are both good options too if you don’t like working with older texts, as they tend to focus on 19th century and beyond. I’d stay away from ENGL 200 for this reason. Hopefully this helps! 

Edit: also if you are American, I’d recommend taking an American lit course, as you may find that you have an implicit deeper historical and cultural understanding of the material just from whatever you learned in high school or even just living in the US. Vice versa if you are Canadian."
depression,fm3dg4i,t3_fssp5o,1585719857.0,"College student here in the same boat. I moved back home from a university a looong ways away because of the virus, and the transition has been tough to say the least. Try to have a separate work space from living space (even if it’s a makeshift bedroom divider) and only work during the hours you normally would. It’s helped a bit and I’ve even gotten creative inspiration beyond normal working hours which has at least been a mental distraction."

I had driving anxiety as well after having been injured in a car wreck when I was young but now I love to drive and continued on to get my pilot’s license! :)  it actually helped my anxiety a lot because it made me realize there are a lot of factors I can control and a lot which I cannot, and that’s okay."
AskReddit,fjwsvad,t3_ff1nwh,1583644976.0,"My rule for judging a potential partner is how they treat their parent(s), strangers, service people, animals, and the environment. I can’t stand littering, unprovoked rudeness, or just general hostility and entitlement.

mcgill,fjw8zqm,t3_ff61nj,1583636684.0,"I feel this to a T. I started in science my first year and almost failed out, and realized that my heart has always been with the arts and lo and behold I’m now majoring in English. I am a lot happier but my grades never recovered from my first year and my self confidence dropped a lot. It’s really tough when you are in an environment where EVERYONE was top student in their high school— it’s like competing against yourself and better versions of yourself. But I remind myself that I’ll get through and I’ll graduate. Also, my dad is a professor at a university in my hometown and he has looked at some of my assignments and commented that it was essentially grad school work or above and beyond an “average” university assignment. McGill is a tough school. Hang in there, things will get better. Feel free to message."
