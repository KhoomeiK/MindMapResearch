infp,f798bmd,t3_dusovu,1573503986.0,This is me all day and everyday which makes it hard to articulate it. I always just wind up blah-blah-blahing while everyone looks confused.
infp,f71q939,t1_f71okch,1573345728.0,"You know, that makes alot of sense. Thank you!"
infp,f6v8bft,t1_f6v7jhj,1573179262.0,I've never really thought about my love language but that really seems like it might be!
infp,f6v89er,t1_f6uxzpk,1573179219.0,I've thought about giving this group of people I talk with at college during lunch a present but I'm feeling a bit self concious about it. Likeee what if they think I'm weird for doing it?
infp,f6v85m1,t1_f6v5dgh,1573179141.0,YUP! Like the gift has to touch them at their soul or something! Haha I'm the exact same even getting presents for people I barely know which makes ot even harder!
infp,f6uv1y8,t1_f6umvdk,1573169404.0,I always come into that problem where they think they have to give me something back like nooo I just want you to know I appreciate you!
infp,f6ug6gi,t1_f6ug2oe,1573162457.0,Why that specifically? Haha
depression,f6qvnuj,t1_f6pvgf6,1573087103.0,THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME RIGHT NOW WHAT
depression,f5qpwms,t1_f5qosz4,1572381044.0,"My stubbornness also keeps me going cause I'm like ""Depression trying get me to give up? Screw you!"" But at the same time, it makes me feel like crap."
depression,f5qojbc,t3_dovhw6,1572380404.0,"Escapism. Books, movies, games, and tv shows. They help me understand myself better and feels less alone."
depression,f5pf8zk,t3_doq5vx,1572357903.0,"Woah, this is the exact same story for me for the last 3 years until recently. I had dropled out of high after breaking up with my ex and got my GED. Everyone kept telling me ""Get a job. Stop being lazy."" And really just treated me like a screw up. I stayed up all night playing video gamea and slept until 4pm only to repeat the same day over. That was, until recently, as I decided to go to college. I'm making friends now but my work in college is pretty sub par. Wouldn't recommend college to make friends but what really helped me after all that was just getting out to an event and doing the best I could."

zines,ey74g2x,t1_ey73xny,1566871550.0,I was thinking of just some random writings and some pointless stuff thrown in with that. What drew me to zines was that they can really be about anything and I think that's pretty great. I was gonna use collage and photography instead of drawings cause I can't draw.
zines,ey72yf4,t1_ey71ct5,1566870407.0,Would card stock work?
