DesiKeto,fqzlz1y,t1_fqmhmn1,1589770148.0,"Yes. This is good advice - if your doctor agrees that keto is a healthy, safe option for you. If he doesn’t agree, then maybe a 2nd/3rd/duplicate/additional/etc etc opinion may be required. You can always go hunting for a “Yes (wo)Man,” but if multiple docs say keto is a “no go” for you, then, ya know... listen.

To piggyback off this comment, u/Hopeandfeathers the traditional **Atkins keto diet of 20g of carbs** per day, but more recent medical literature also notes that this can be damaging to some (elevated AST/ALT & fatty liver, for example). Even Atkins advocates for getting regular bloodwork to watch the liver enzymes. 

With all that said, it is possible to stay in ketosis with up to **80g of Carbs** per day. 

If you’re interested in trying this w/your doc’s OK, you might wanna pick up some Ketone Test Strips at a drug store (manufactured to test for diabetic ketoacidosis, but also tests ketosis).

Speaking to my own, personal experience. I did 20g or less & my bloodwork stressed my liver in a way that made them think I had Hep C. I don’t. But after that, I was told that I, personally, should never test with ketones in dark purple/large range. It was a “if you go above moderate on your test strips” add more veggies.”

Again, that is *only my personal experience*, but figured it may add some insight. I’ve done keto & clean eating for years & have great bloodwork now. 

Not trying to scare you away from this eating/lifestyle choice at all - it’s life changing. More just a “yeahhhh talk to your doc.” 

But then again, that was me, & I tend to stupidly overdo everything.

Like on a video game & you **know** you won’t stand a chance unless you approach the area with 3 lives. 

So once you’ve been stuck there for a while & you approach the game’s “hard to pass” spot - you’re listless, frustrated, bored, angry, apathetic - to avoid a rage quit you just kill your self & start over with 3 lives.

The leg up of those 3 lives (*if you can actually hang on to their advantage until you get to the “Difficult Spot” of the game, that is*)

Anyway... not Suicidal in the LEAST b/c Death scares me shittless. And Hell, I’ll even suffer through the “do-over” of past tragedies. Because I now see where I’ve f’ed up.

**TL;DR:** So yeah... If my life was a Sega Game, I’d totally hit “quit” so hard so that I could either 

**A)** prevent getting into what seems like an impossible situation with my one stupid heart-life
          -or_

**B)** If I cant reroute the Redo-Me - like roads & Rome, here, all roads lead to this “Bonus Depression Level” - then at least I’m entering it with as much advantage & life & as powered up as I can be. 

**True TL;DR:** would totally kill myself if I walked up to Final “Depression” Boss Level with only one heart/life. Fuck that. 3 hearts for that or bust."

Same with Pink. They told her to change her image to get famous. She even referenced it in her song:

     LA told me
     You’ll never be a pop star
     All you hafta change
     Is everything you are

LA being music exec L.A. Reid, not Los Angeles.

It’s like I said, I mostly agreed but there are many creative people who are attractive BECAUSE they are creative.

Kinda like how universities (in the U.S., especially) now have rampant grade inflation, where a paper is just “meh, average” would’ve been a solid “C” 40-50 years ago, is now easily a “B.” This sub sticks to the old school, non-inflated system where a “5” (equivalent to a “C”) is the true average. Plus, (& unfortunately to many a Redditor’s ego) the scale is *not* compared to regular people. Instead, a 10 is a straight up supermodel with unique features & nigh perfect symmetry. 

So, here, a real life gorgeous girl gets a 6.75, but unfortunately since she’s not a supermodel, an 8 doesn’t happen here much. I wouldn’t be surprised if elsewhere you were easily an “8.”

Plus, I personally would never rate anyone at a 10 - while there *are* examples of a 10 listed in “Info” section - I consider a 10 as “Perfect.” Since perfect is unattainable & no matter how much we try, we will never achieve perfection, no 10 will ever be doled out from me.

Is it not possible that all the “scary” things you read about (astral projection, etc) are not just another aspect of bathing in God’s Glory? 

Perhaps those who have astral experiences etc are closer to God and hidden Universal Truths? And perhaps the Church has taught us to fear it because unlocking some of these truths could strip them of their power. 

Just because it is unknown or different doesn’t make it “bad” or “dangerous.” 

If God is good & God is in your heart, then I doubt you have much to fear. 

Remember that God is God. The Church is NOT God, but rather a conduit of His message. The messengers - the clergy - are fallible humans, just like yourself. And the only way to “know” God is through your own inquiries, doubts, beliefs, love, etc. 

Keep the Faith. But remember that the Vatican is one of the best protected, fortified cities in the world for a reason. And there is a LOT they are keeping guarded. Or hidden. However you look at it. (Look up conspiracy theories on Vatican Time travel devices; I’m not a conspiracy theorist, nor did I go looking for that kind of content, but still... just an example. More fitting would be doing research on the Gospel of St. Thomas.)
