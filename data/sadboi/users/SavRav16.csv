Now 24, I want to drop down to less work. Years of using tools wrong and wrestling huge dogs (along with heavy equipment from the 3 years in a warehouse) have taken their toll. But the oldest groomer there, more than twice my age but has only groomed for maybe 2 years (came from academy setting) talks down on me when I express any aches or pains, while talking up my skill and detail work.

[Edit: the 1$ tip was from a full groom with heavy scissor work on a miniature poodle.]

On the other hand, it is always super rewarding to get a 10-20 dollar tip (I was one given a 50$ tip from a owner with 2 dogs) & it makes the groomer feel very appreciated & will want to try harder for you the next time. 

Grooming dogs is very difficult & straining on the body, not to mention uncooperative dogs & even worse owners makes the days drag on, so those few great clients really lifts the spirits and can make our week."

Thankfully I haven't had a major accident to a dog, just knicks & small cuts every once in a blue moon. My own arms however are an entirely different story. Stab/bite wounds, sanding my fingers with the dremel, bruising myself with clumsiness. 

I want to say the one I felt the worst about was I caught the flap of skin near the thigh with my clippers & the skin stretched. Still small but I was only 15-16 & felt terrible. 

Now at 24 I'm looking at people who cry over their first accident like ""oh honey, you popped your cherry"".

I remember this guy was assisting us in the salon & I asked if he felt comfortable doing nails. He got down to the last foot & the dog kicked, causing him to cut too short & bled a lot. I took care of it & finished the nails, talking to him & figuring out if it made or broke him. (It broke him) Not making short of accidents, but shit happens.

doggrooming,fmy3p14,t1_fmxe4c1,1586477446.0,"I just wanted to add it would be a good idea to get in touch with an experienced groomer & talk with them over what type of haircut you are wanting, before taking a clipper through the hair. They can help you with what lengths to use, where the spots are you can easily nick, as well as other details difficult to retain when multiple people are throwing all sorts of facts out there when you are missing the knowledgeable experience to put them to use.

I've had clients bring me their diy job where the the dog came to me looking like they went through a wood chipper. A little yorkie puppy the ""breeder"" (what the owners told me) groomed for example that was chopped to heck & back with a nice little cut on his head. The only thing I could do was clip him even.

It will also depend on your coworkers. My salon manager told me a story of the person she groomed under at petsmart lying to the owner, claiming she beat their dog because the manager there knew the client was a big tipper & wanted that money herself.

If you are just grooming at home & not professionally, a cordless is prone to more issues & it may not be worth it to start with something that high dollar. (My andis 5 speed cordless is a slightly older model at 270$ and my coworker with the newer model at 340$ish)

My cordless has had the motor go out & had to be fixed & the base go out at about 3 years. I groom about 5-7 dogs a day 4-6 days a week to give you an idea of the abuse it gets.

A corded light weight AGC on the 100-150$ range should work if you are just doing at home work on your own dog. Anything lower is a cheapy and isn't worth the plastic it's built in. But this is a personal opinion. 

Also, a naked #10 blade is VERY short, mostly used for cleaning the eyes & potty trail. There are lift comb attachments you can get to keep the hair longer that work with #10 blades."

I've been grooming with petco for about 2 years now. I personally like how they cover maintenance, benefits, and if something happens in the salon, it is covered out of their pocket rather than my own.

Benefits & guaranteed pay are my biggest pros.

Cons I would say are you can't control your own prices, mussels for biting dogs are not allowed. It's a ""when in doubt, refer out"" when  it comes to health & behavior. Freedom is limited: Clients can not assist with their own animals, no creative liberties (dye/creative grooming is not available) & pressured to upsale.

It doesn't get easier. I'm just dealing & living with it. I still get moments where I want to fall into relapse & have to struggle not to hurt myself. I don't take medication since when I was on antidepressants it repressed my appetite & I would go two or three days without eating. 

I have breakdowns where it feels like the world fell apart & every kind word is like a knife. I want to tell them how I truly feel & want, but suppress myself as to not bother them with my problems. 

It isn't the same for everyone & yours may be more or less severe. It is important to tell someone about your problems, because it fills & bottles up inside, till it's too much & overflows. Every little thing, could be the trigger."
