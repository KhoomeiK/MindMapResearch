Sure, maybe we don't see the juxtaposition which is apparently so essential to cyberpunk in the image itself, but it is not at all difficult to conceive of the idea that it lurks around the image's periphery. Perhaps the contrast occurs down on the ground level, for instance, with scenes occurring like those found when Deckard is eating noodles etc. mostly et cetera. 

As another point, I want to use an analogy - which may be fallacious/false equivalence - but it is nevertheless how I conceive of this argument we have. Let us suppose that the ""beach"" HAD to be defined by a bunch of sand being situated against the sea. These two things HAVE to be in the image for it to be defined and identified as the ""beach"". And yet one could take a picture with their back to the sea, and just capture the sand and the sand dunes and the pebbles. To me all of these signifiers that point towards the beach's identity cannot be ignored - especially when the image is titled ""the beach""... and I think it's the same with cyberpunk. I think being pedantic and saying ""well you have to capture the sea and the beach"" is simply missing the point. That is, we have one half of the equation - the high tech stuff - and, along with the title, it is easy to tell that the other half of it, the sea - or the low tech stuff - is there as well (even if we cannot directly see it)."

TV episodes often end upon a profoundly sad note, and then the credits roll whilst sad music is playing in the background. These endings allow us to exist in a kind of perpetually sad moment because we are denied access to whatever happens afterwards.

But in reality, life goes on. Life doesn't cut away to end credits where we can indulge and linger in some of its sad instances.

So the way the last shot stayed on Bojack and Diane, rather than immediately cutting to the credits shortly after the sad music started playing, kind of played into that sentiment of how life continues.

Saunton was so scared of Morphy that he refused to even play him. I think that speaks for itself.

This is what it says: ""In accord with the prevailing sentiment of the time, Morphy esteemed chess only as an amateur activity, considering the game unworthy of pursuit as a serious occupation.""

Emphasis on the ""in accord with the prevailing sentiment"". As I literally said in the comment you're replying to, how chess was viewed in the 19th century and how it is viewed today are different things.

He didn't suck at studying or memorisation. Again, look at the wiki properly:  ""During his studies, Morphy is said to have memorized the complete Louisiana Civil Code."" Like fuck. 

Also, he did have ""methodical play"", and the kind that is expected of today's super Gms. As I've said before, looking at his games makes me feel as if he travelled back in time.

He quit chess because there was not any decent competition. He grew bored of it because he was so good and smashed everyone else.

>He was a GM in his day but if you brought him directly forward he'd be probably be a weak IM

That's not fair. Players today are ""better"" because they rely upon years of theory and computers, both unavailable to Morphy.

The first is resorting to ad hominem doesn't make you win an argument. I understand that we are on the internet, and it's fun to insult people, but it honestly just makes you look bad here. Don't detract from your argument's credibility by throwing around insults. 

The second thing is that he does ""show on the radar"". Many GMs refer to Morphy all the time, including Ben Finegold, Yasser Seirawan, the chessbras if anyone here watches twitch. Heck, even the ones mentioned in this thread do as well - with Kasparov, Carlsen, Fischer all commenting upon his brilliance from time to time. Just looking through his wiki after I saw this thread, Fischer thought Morphy was the most accurate player of all time for example. 

The third point is that there is a reason no one has mentioned him in this thread, and that is because he is a player from the past. Of course more recent players are going to be up for the title of best player ever because they can rely upon engines and years of chess theory. Morphy didn't have any of that, and yet intuitively knew the theory and put it into practice with some wonderful games.

He got so good he quit chess because there simply wasn't any decent competition. That's saying something. The guy was therefore just sheer talent, and would fucking own anyone if he grew up in today's world.

Yea, if it's an introductory phrase to a sentence I know about that.

Thanks for the comment. I've come across a few of these now. I don't believe it's right to insert a comma just because there is a ""natural pause"" in the sentence, but I guess my opinion doesn't matter."
depression,f80kl7x,t1_f7xpzbd,1574131279.0,Yep. Is it edgy to say I don't know who I am anymore? Because I don't. Maybe I do. I'm just a boring sack of unintelligent shit.
rickandmorty,f7xde0a,t1_f7xd6vp,1574053478.0,The last one came up 20 minutes after the episode finished airing. But I don't know how consistent the site is. Maybe it was so fast just because it was the first episode of the season. I therefore can't really say when this episode will appear.

dataisbeautiful,f7qis3g,t3_dx64ok,1573964533.0,Why is this upvoted so much? This graph makes no sense. What do the colours signify? You just have an x and y axis. Everything else is meaningless.
nihilism,f7fa5gh,t3_dvq3x9,1573675333.0,"If you're in first year I suggest picking a more straightforward topic. First year doesn't count. 

Also, and this goes for your whole degree, steer clear of terms like ""postmodernism"". It'll just get confusing. Stick to easy concepts."
creepy,f72h4p9,t1_f72cj25,1573362872.0,"We did not! Yep, it really uses the fear of the unknown. 

Also her eyes... the tight, claustrophobic framings, the sudden blast of nonlinear music that comes out of nowhere... the fact that the antagonist is powerful because they take away what the protagonist heavily relied upon (speech)... 

yea it's a bloody solid episode."
creepy,f7213xn,t1_f6ysoet,1573351833.0,"Yea they were good. 

Everyone always forgets about the Midnight episode though. Still scares me to this day. Surprisingly, Blink didn't phase me much when I watched it recently even though I was scared shitless (nightmares for weeks) as a kid."

funny,f694bzg,t1_f67sbya,1572735273.0,"Out of interest, why are so many people using VPNs now? It's all I see advertised at the end of videos.

Like are y'all pirating a shitload of crap? Are you looking up how to make a bomb or simply just enjoying some cp? like wtf are people doing for these companies to be successful? Trying to access content not available in your country? What content? 

Feel like there's quite a lot of misunderstanding about what a vpn actually does."

quite good actually. probably my favourite villanelle because it really used the form well. do not go gentle was also good of course but boy i think love song really got that obsession quality out of the repetitive lines"

chess,f4cqt7r,t1_f4cop53,1571532691.0,"The title says ""black to play"". On this sub that's parlance for black to win really. And yes, I've seen the position, and honestly I know a lot of endgames where it looks totally hopeless for one side and yet there will be some tactic for them to pull through."
chess,f4co0dc,t3_dk9fkp,1571531681.0,I don't see the win tbh. People are saying c4? so what? bishop takes. don't think queening with the h pawn is ever a threat.
