Animal Crossing is originally designed to have this slow day by day pace. It's okay not to have everything super polished and figured out. Find beauty in your island! Take on one thing on a time. You don't necessarily need a great big cohesive design, just what you like & what you find rewarding/pretty. I used to have crazy bad island anxiety (if that's even a thing?) because of the internet but i've found a lot of genuine love for my island bc it's mine & the hours i've put into it. I've personally loved taking little things i've seen everywhere and putting them on my island in my own way. :)"

I've seen what it takes and that's just not me. I'm not saying that everyone is necessarily good or evil... That's fake. But I do know the world is incessantly cruel and I am already all out of cards. Also I'm not a really angry person... I get angry at times like anyone does. But I mainly just feel defeated and sad and numb. I don't have the strength to keep pushing let alone 'drive my demons'."
depression,foidg6h,t1_foicvj1,1587784101.0,"That's not true... Even if you don't 'feel like' you're addicted it's obvious you have a drug dependency. I did too about 2 years ago. I was ready to die. But I didn't. And now i'm here... My brain is completely fucked. 'Living a short fun one' only works if you actually die when you THINK you might. But it's very possible you won't... Then what? 
Go to a support group that's a good first step. The withdrawals from psychedelics is virtually nonexistent so you should be fine but the emotional stuff is the worst part. I can't tell you to stop, and I know you're not gonna listen to me. But know that what you're doing is extremely destructive. That's all I can tell you. I thought I was invincible until my HPPD was so bad it was bordering on psychosis. Just my two cents."
depression,foia8pg,t3_g7b0m5,1587782025.0,"yeah... I have HPPD too. Stop taking drugs. Like, immediately. You WILL care once you get absolutely fucked and it gets way worse and there's no going back. Doing psychedelics once a month is bad enough, but your brain is already completely fried, so there's really extra incentive to stop doing drugs. 
Also I think you might have depressive tendencies but more than anything it sounds like you have a drug issue, which can lead to depression. But not caring about your own health is definitely a piece of depression.
You rationalizing that 'you're not addicted' but you're regularly abusing honestly makes you think you're in denial... You need help. Are there any resources for you? Support groups or therapy?"

I wouldn't be too worried about it, the way I try and avoid it (especially when I try and fall asleep because I have random noises in my head) is by listening to a podcast and being really tired to the point of passing out very quickly after laying down to sleep."
HPPD,ff8nwb6,t3_es70a3,1579688043.0,"I know how you feel. I already struggled with severe disabling depression before I had HPPD... but it made everything so much worse. I have so much empathy for you & how you've been feeling recently. There's nothing wrong with wanting the pain to stop, especially when you live with HPPD that is debilitating. 
That being said, that also doesn't mean there isn't any hope for you. I saw you said you have a psychiatrist and a therapist, but it's not helping. Have you tried seeking a new doctor? I had to change my doctor twice before I found one that would 1) believe me and 2) treat me. Advocating for yourself is a huge tool in your toolbox. Just take it day by day. If you can't do that, take it hour by hour. If you can't make it until the next hour, just get to the next minute. The best medicine for HPPD is time. My HPPD was absolute hell for the first 9 or so months. Like you, my ear ringing developed well after I got HPPD, and I also didn't have visual snow until around 4 months in. But it can get better. It is possible. Just hang in there, okay? Get off the medication if it's not helping you & find a new doctor if you can that will actually listen to you. It makes a world of a difference."
HPPD,ff4s1nu,t3_erleb4,1579571068.0,"No one can tell you wether or not it'll turn out okay for you. The only way you'll know is to just take a tab. However, based on your experience with weed, I'd say it's definitely in your best interest for you to stay away from psychedelics for now if you're all ready struggling with dissociating. Acid can wait, but your mental health/stability cannot. Take care of yourself first."

HPPD,fdoi68o,t1_fdnna3r,1578605638.0,"You're definitely not the only one. That's what this sub is here for. The best piece of advice I can give you is to stop all the drugs now. That's big rule #1. Your body is giving you a warning sign if it hasn't gone into panic mode. If you have HPPD, the worst drugs you can continue to use are weed and psychedelics. Obviously, I can only tell you that, and you're gonna do what you wanna do. But I can almost guarantee you'll be back on the sub sooner rather than later if you do shrooms and smoke weed. I can understand why it's hard to even think about putting them down but it is possible! That's my final input. Do what you will with it."
HPPD,fdmve6r,t3_em7if8,1578567606.0,"Sounds like HPPD to me with CEV's and being unable to sleep, as well as your visuals sticking around now. You'll notice them more if you pay attention to them, after a while it'll get easier to ignore/deal with them. It's not necessarily 'bad' if you feel that way, but if you continue to do psychedelics or smoke weed I can tell you that's when the visuals will get worse (and definitely stick around longer but that sounds like why you're on the sub in the first place). Usually the visuals don't get people, although they definitely can be awful. It's the derealization, depersonalization, anxiety, depression, etc that make day to day life difficult. Your experience is a pretty common one amongst the sub, please look around some more to see how you can deal with HPPD in your day to day life. (:"
HPPD,fdiy6zp,t3_elkh9a,1578453748.0,No one knows for sure. The only way to not get HPPD (or risk getting HPPD) is to not do psychedelics. That's the common denominator.
HPPD,fcv9vap,t3_eivy3s,1577997665.0,"Smoking weed will definitely make everything worse man. You gotta quit & quit for a while in order to see some improvement. For me it took over 3 months to find a baseline after i quit. It's hard, but possible."
HPPD,fcm94f8,t3_ehxqk3,1577767565.0,"Any time you take a psychedelic you run the risk of developing HPPD, no matter how small."
