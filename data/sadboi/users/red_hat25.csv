Use daily life motifs: an email, a job interview cover letter, a trip you took. Ultimately, the writing portion is there to determine you can communicate with Spanish speakers. Think of generic topics you could talk to someone else about. Once you’re done writing your passage, read it and review it to make it sound coherent. After, you can look up online any words you’re unsure about. 

You also have to read in Spanish to get used to the syntax. Try reading an article a day so you familiarize yourself with the flow of the words. You can also replicate what you just read with your own words in a short Spanish passage. :)"

No matter how different it is from a few years ago. Think of a person as child and then as a teenager. Their body changed with time. You are still the same loveable being in any body type. You have to embrace your body changing as a result of time and battling an eating disorder. 

While the first step is acceptance, the second is body cues. Feel your body. Is it hungry? Nourish it. Does it have a lot of energy? Go exercise in whatever activity you enjoy. Paying attention to these cues will naturally set your body in its ideal weight and shape. Could that be the one from a few years ago? Possibly. Could it be different? Likely, because bodies change with time. But understand during the process that you will heal and love your body’s natural shape. Work with yourself and take care of your mental and physical health."

BDSMAdvice,ezjzw57,t3_d1adfh,1567952777.0," My husband and I went through the same a few years ago. I know you guys aren’t married, but look up wifesharing (that’s the name of the kink). That’s basically what you’re describing. It can be pretty fun, as long as all parties can deal with it emotionally. Also consider that you don’t have to do it per se, since the fantasy can play out in your head without the emotional consequences of sharing your girl. 


All in all, it’s a very common kink. There are many articles out there that help deal with the jealousy that may arise from it after it is all said and done. We have a lot of fun doing it because we know our relationship is intact and trustworthy. If that is the case with yours, why not give it a try? 


To end it on a good note, visit our friends over at r/wifesharing to see how much fun it can be!


Edit: I read all the other comments. Wifesharing is not cuckolding. There is no humiliation for you. I like to think of them like this:

Wifesharing: “my wife is hot. You can play with her.”

Cuckolding: “your wife is hot. I’ll sleep with her.”

Of course all this is within consensual boundaries, but given the feelings of you not being able to see her take someone else’s dick, a good way to ease into it is wifesharing, and eventually move onto cuckolding if that’s your thang."
