The relationships I have had ended up with them either abusing me or leaving me.  My recent divorce has taken its toll on me.  My ex is a millionaire and told me daily to prove I loved him.  He said he never felt I loved him and little by little took everything away from me including my hope.  Now I’m alone and he is the victor.  I’m a woman but due to privacy I am posting as a man.  I’ve never had anyone truly love me and I feel my existence is simply an error.  Every time I try and hope it’s immediately replaced with reality.  I am alone in this world.  I’ve been used and tossed out more times than I can count.  I don’t have friends or a mother or dad or much else.  It’s easy to read this and say “you have a lot to be grateful for” but honestly my existence is taking up air someone who is apparently more favored than I, deserves.  My entire life I’ve searched for love and the ones I love the most have abandoned me.  I did and still love my ex husband even though he said and says I do not.  He says I’m a gold digger,  a whore and nothing.  I believe he is right.  I don’t have anyone to refute this so he is successful.  I’m sure my suicide will be an ego boost if anything at all.  I wish and pray for a miracle but none have arrived.  To all of those on here my heart breaks for you but you are not alone and sadly I will be a random human with a short pointless story."
