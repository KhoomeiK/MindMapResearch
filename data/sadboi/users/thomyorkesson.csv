Could they have possibly fled while you were still in shock and running to your parents to tell them?


I know that might sound farfetched, but there are some **crazy** people out there, and using a large cloth to hide, as well as quickly desensitize/immobilize the victim could seem like a plausible plan for an intruder."

I've always described it as feeling as if a door had just opened, even though it hadn't. 


I often dismiss it when I sense/feel it, but last week I had a rather jarring experience that is making me question what it really is that brings on that sudden 'unaware awareness'. 

I was laying in bed, just about to drift off when I was completely overcome by that feeling. It started as it usually does, a sudden odd sense as if a door has opened, almost like an unknown presence had entered the area (the 'area' being my small bedroom with no closet or place for someone to hide). 


That small feeling very quickly intensified until every single cell in my body was *screaming* at me, ""get out of your room, you need to exit this room *right* now... **N O W** ."" 
I did exactly that, basically running out of my own room for a reason even *I* didn't know, practically shaking in my boots. I stood in the middle of my kitchen for a good half hour before making it back into my room, and eventually falling asleep.


I don't know what, or why I felt and/or feel this, but I now very strongly believe that we should all listen when our subconscious minds try to tell us something.





Edit: spacing issues!"

AskReddit,f7iluu9,t1_f7h2gos,1573761695.0,"This! Panic attacks can be both terrifying, and genuinely traumatic.


I remember my first one painfully well. I was 20, hanging out at a family friends house with my mom, when I suddenly burst into laughter. Without any idea why, I continued to uncontrollably giggle for a good 30 mins before they both asked what was up, to which I replied 'I dont know, but I'm fine!'. 

 
I was very wrong. We left not long after, and halfway through the walk from their house to ours, I started to shake, and my heart began to race. My mom looked at me and asked if I was okay, and my response was to *immediately* burst into a full-blown panic attack. All at once I began sobbing, hyperventilating as I quite literally fell to the ground. 
She managed to get me up and walk me home, where I sat down on the porch and continued to involuntarily convulse as I sobbed/yelled/gasped. 


Soon after making it to our porch, the real scary parts started to set in. The entire band of my chest, from my sternum all the way around my back started to painfully tighten over and over again as I freaked out, at which point I was pretty sure I was having a heart attack. 


After about an hour, I was able to calm down and control my breathing, but that was without a doubt the most frightening thing that has ever happened to me, physically. Panic attacks are no joke, kids!"
