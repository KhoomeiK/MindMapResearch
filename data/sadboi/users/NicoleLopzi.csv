GenderCritical,fltnctt,t1_fltmm81,1585480266.0,"I had my princess phase way back into the start of my transition, like a lot of other trans girls, yes. That was to test grounds, to see what feels right, to experiment what I couldn't while I was stuck wearing sailor clothes and a buzzcut hair at 6 years old. I just wanted to feel what I couldn't have and I did so in the comfort of my own home, didn't force it on anyone to see, and the few pictures that I took were shown to my supporting friends and communities, who treated me fantastically. In the end it wasn't my style, but it was worth a shot. Your ""bimbofication"" can still be applied to cis girls and I don't see you make any mention to those girls, who are still valid as it's just a way to express themselves. Feminism isn't only about burning your bra, letting your body hair grow and hating in men, it's about fighting for our right to choose and for one day a 50's housewife be as valid and equal as a radical tomboyish girl
But that's also an opinion I'm allowed to share in this space for women"
