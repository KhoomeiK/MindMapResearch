One thing that I found really helped in terms of networking is befriending people in the community and just being really active. Do art trades, draw people's OC's that you admire, ect. Fanart of popular characters always helps too. As for comparing yourself in general, I've always had a bit of a competitive mindset in me so I used it in a way to improve myself telling myself I'll get to their technical level or maybe even become better then them. Not in a stressful or harmful way of course because you need to remember why you did art in the first place: Because it's fun and you enjoy it! Never lose that, it's very important and use it as your main focus. Everyone has different styles and improves at different paces, doesn't mean your arts bad, it just makes it you, and sometimes that's what people might admire regardless of how good you are."

Being so sensitive to emotions sucks, I see people get affected by something with someone else and they're fine a week later. For me, it takes months, and even then it will still remain for years as invasive memories. I've had a few where I've found I was really connected to, but in the end it always ended up being one sided, and then they just kind of leave after a while.
