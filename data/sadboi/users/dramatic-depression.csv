MaladaptiveDreaming,fl0xqtw,t3_flnma1,1584717979.0,"Good for you! For me, I turn my daydreams into stories. I love writing, and not to pat myself on the back or anything, but I think Iâ€™m pretty good at it :) Best of luck on your career! Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll be fantastic ðŸ’•"
socialanxiety,fl0xjmz,t1_fl0wga9,1584717859.0,"Not sure the teacher would accept it without a note from my therapist, and her office is shut down. I might just have to brave my anxiety here, there really isnâ€™t a way out. But thank you for your kind words :)"
socialanxiety,fl0vwvx,t1_fl0vm5v,1584716881.0,Iâ€™m not sure sheâ€™ll be understanding. My family is helping me with the issue now. Thanks for listening to my little rant ðŸ’•
mentalillness,fkqk12b,t3_fjs66c,1584448340.0,"I have a similar issue. My older sister is, in short, not good for my mental health. And Iâ€™m stuck with her for a month. Seeing my best friend always makes me feel better, but now I canâ€™t see him either, and FaceTime is pretty crappy from in my room. I wish you the best of luck ðŸ’•"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fjnmxp6,t3_fea4op,1583510746.0,"1, 2, 3, all yes. 6, nah, theyâ€™re two completely different things. 4 & 5, ho boy. Iâ€™m not the most qualified to answer those. Itâ€™s cool to see someone I can relate to though."
Synesthesia,fjkchly,t1_fj73jx8,1583424499.0,"Hm. I have some associations, but not a lot, and theyâ€™re not very strong. Donâ€™t think I have it, but itâ€™s still fun to browse this sub :p"
Synesthesia,fj6yu3f,t3_egwmrd,1583082983.0,"I donâ€™t think I have synesthesia, Iâ€™m browsing this sub for fun, but this post actually makes me consider it. To me, math is blue, English is pink, social studies is orange, and science is green. Iâ€™ve always bought folders for school corresponding to those colors so Iâ€™d know which was which."
arttocope,fj4u96q,t1_fj4teel,1583017028.0,"This is so cool! Thanks so much, youâ€™ve made my day ðŸ˜Š"
arttocope,fj4t89z,t3_fb5wrh,1583016335.0,I feel this. Itâ€™s frickin terrifying sometimes. Sending love to you ðŸ’•
arttocope,fj4rrz8,t1_fj42vb8,1583015341.0,"Whoa, this for real? Thought my art was trash lol. Yeah, Iâ€™d be cool with that!"
mentalillness,firy8cj,t3_f9cua8,1582673544.0,Thatâ€™s called a sensory overload. I get those too. I donâ€™t really know how to describe them but thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re called.
arttocope,fi71i7s,t1_fi5i32a,1582212308.0,"Thanks :)
Itâ€™s supposed to be like inner demons and mental illness. Kinda symbolizes a lot of different thing in my mind."
selfharm,fhpcuat,t1_fhp9pwg,1581786717.0,Iâ€™ve been trying those things. They were my gateways to this. My brain wants more. Iâ€™m trying hard not to give it what it wants.
