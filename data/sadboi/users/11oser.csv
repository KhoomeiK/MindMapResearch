derealization,fls2eby,t3_fqsoqr,1585432903.0,"hi dude i was 15 when i first started dissociating and it was also triggered by weed. i was suicidal and nothing felt real for like a year. what got me thru it was finding an outlet (for me it was music) and talking to friends. me n this other girl i met online who was also suicidal n dissociated used to text all day and it helped alot. jus having a friend to talk to abt that stuff n relate. we recently reconnected n we're both doing alot better now. this will pass. stop smoking weed and distract yourself, surround urself w ppl and things that make u feel a lil more normal. even mundane stuff helps a lot. dm me if you needa talk n remember ur not alone and it will get better"

BodyDysmorphia,fg6rkjl,t3_ex4alx,1580575254.0,"pls dont let misogynistic rick and morty ig memes determine ur self worth. think abt the type of insufferable guy who would like that post. there are alt righters w millions of likes and it doesnt make their points any more valid, theres an audience for everything and likes says more abt them than the validity of the content itself"
amiugly,fg6ptsz,t3_ex2h4l,1580574109.0,so cute aww
ExistentialSupport,ffjc6h1,t3_etps7p,1579995218.0,i second the other comment. the feeling will diminish with time and you might come to accept it and it'll give you a newfound appreciation for life. its weird to be aware of it but remember we're all on this weird journey together and existence is a total mystery so overthinking it is pointless. may as well just live it out like everyone else
antidepressants,feqydnl,t1_feqi8yk,1579347444.0,"like i said i dont feel it nearly as much lately and i think its the wellbutrin, on its own its amazing tho. a bit of an antidepressant in its own right and helps u focus n want to do stuff."

antidepressants,fe0mw67,t3_enk4h7,1578816265.0,"dude no its alrite to take pills if ur brains fucked, i got off zoloft to switch to another antidep (that isnt working smh) and now  ive been off for a few months n it succkcks. i switched bc of sex problems but id rather not cum than be this depressed. i guess i forgot what it was like. anyway do what feels right but just know theres nothing wrong w having to take meds to feel normal and u may regret it alot if u get off them n then u needa deal w slowly going back on and the side effects n junk."
ExistentialSupport,fcp87tu,t3_eic9j2,1577853751.0,yea i felt like id taken the red pill a month ago n was having constant panic attacks and thought id feel like that forever but its slowly gotten better. now im sorta so deep in this rabbit hold of 'wtf is existence' that i dont like... care as much? idk. its weird. it still fucks me up but try n distract urself n make art n focus on doing stuff n living right now bc truth is none of this makes any fuckin sense so may as well just roll w it
