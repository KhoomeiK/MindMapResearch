But I miss the BMW's steering, the navigation was better than Audi's, you can get tech on the F30 that you couldn't get on the B8.5, and RWD is just fun.

Learning to negotiate and follow the sales process is the skill that'll pay off and make your job easier, listen to the experienced people and your managers. As you get some experience, you may get some customers because you're a saleswoman- I definitely sold customers who were happy to work with a woman. 

Yes, there are jerks, but you'll quickly grow a thick skin and learn to handle them. I got good at ignoring their attempts to get to me and kill them with kindness.

A very important tip- wear comfy shoes! You'll be on your feet a lot, and if you do wear heels, make sure they're well broken-in and good for driving."

Audi,fhnlxit,t3_f400ao,1581728602.0,"Prestige has it. But it’s so rare that my dealership will sell one Prestige for every 20-25 Premium/Premium Plus. I also loved my BMW’s heads-up display, and custom-ordered my ‘17 Prestige."

askcarsales,fhhsp57,t3_f3bo8d,1581610994.0,"We’ll do an extended test drive- plenty of people need to be sure it fits in the garage, get the spouse’s approval, want to try the car without salespeople being in the car. As long as someone seems serious, we sign them out on a dealer plate, collect insurance information, and make sure we’re all clear on when they’re expected back. It does help!"

So far, I haven't had issues with it, but Audi's are very intolerant of not perfectly following the maintenance schedule, and when things break, they'll be pricier than on non-German cars. The price seems a little high, unless it's a decently loaded car and CPO."

askcarsales,fh97bdz,t3_f1srjx,1581374746.0,"2017 Audi A4. Used my employee discount for 15% off, custom-ordered it because I wanted bright blue, heads-up display, adaptive cruise control, no wood trim. Leased it for 3 years, came in about 5,000 miles low, buyout was at the very lowest end of trade value. So I kept the car, took Audi Financial’s cheap financing, tinted the windows, and I’m not allowed near a shop that does APR tuning until the CPO warranty runs out. It’s a great all-around car- quattro is awesome at snow, 34-37 mpg highway, good sound system, very smart driver assistance, fits in my tiny garage. 

This car is going to be my daily until I get German Car Repair Bills even with employee pricing. Next car I really want, as a fun/summer car, is an E46 M3. I’m always keeping an eye on my company’s BMW store to see if they get any good trades."

askcarsales,fgnf0y2,t3_ez84tq,1580943472.0,"A lot of it depends on management. Yes, luxury car buyers can be high-maintenance, and in my area we attract a lot of engineers who want something nicer than a Subaru. Make friends with your service department for a heads-up every time a 4.0 engine blows the turbo, or a 2.0’s timing chain goes, and the customer needs a new car. People will endlessly whine about the lack of remote starters. But clearing snow from the parking lot is very easy!"
whatcarshouldIbuy,fgkjbk6,t3_eyu73w,1580866885.0,"Bought a silver truck because it had the right package and was on the lot, hated the color for being boring and generic. Leased a black car because it had all the options I wanted, and then I lost it weekly in parking lots (half the state has a black sedan) and trashed the light beige interior. Finally I ordered a bright royal blue car, and I love it! Bright colors are a major selling point for me, and even though I've had a red car, the only speeding ticket I've gotten was in the silver truck. 

When I'm more seriously shopping for that BMW M3, silver or grey are hard deal-breakers unless the deal is good enough to be able to get it promptly wrapped in some slightly annoying bright color."
whatcarshouldIbuy,fghkg6i,t3_ey7ooe,1580786842.0,"If you're willing to go a little older/higher miles for the sake of budget, check out a Porsche Cayenne or Macan S. Cayenne is close to Jeep size and can tow, Macan S is smaller than the SQ5 but quite a bit more fun to drive and comfier seats. Look for ones with good maintenance records, and expect either dealer service or to find a really good German car mechanic."
Audi,fghasd5,t3_eygxsa,1580780654.0,"On my first car, I accidentally ripped off the bracket on a snowbank, and for the next 2 years, no issues in MA or CT. When I did the RS grille on my A4 three months ago, I of course removed the front plate, and haven't had any issues in CT. The plate is now in the front passenger footwell, in case I need to explain myself. 

Seems like CT's rule about needing two plates is ""you should have a front plate, but if not, no big deal."""

Audi,fg7kwja,t3_ex7a1i,1580595000.0,"Oh no, I'm so sorry. Such a gorgeous car, but it sacrificed itself to try to protect you and your daughter. Take care of yourselves, the soreness afterwards is rough. When I got hit in my former BMW, I was so sore the next few days. After a scary crash in a Pontiac, and then one in a BMW, I'm definitely a believer in the quality of German engineering and safety. 

And there are still some 2019 S5's on the dealers' lots, if you don't want to deal with the touchscreen and waiting for a 2020."

Kind of complicated, but I find NADA is closest to what banks will use to value a car, KBB is low, and the other three are best for cars that we’ll probably wholesale."
femalefashionadvice,ffamewe,t3_esc8zs,1579739362.0,"Normally I'm femme to the point people assume I'm straight, and love dresses and makeup. Probably due to a few too many years of school uniforms with skirts, I dressed a lot more like a lazy teenage boy for a few years, and then realized that being girly could be a lot of fun, and I've embraced it. But, I'm still looking for some good button-down shirts that work on bustier women, and can be worn with ties- I have to dress fairly formally at work, and the guys all are fine with me wearing a tie! It's been a few years since I've worn one and I not-so-secretly love them."
