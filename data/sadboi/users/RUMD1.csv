oneplus,fr4l260,t3_gmng6p,1589891166.0,"Honestly, at this point I think every device is suffering from the same issues, it's the normal behavior for this screens / hardware.

The thing is that many people don't notice it in normal usage... So you will always hear someone saying ""mine doesn't suffer from any screen issues"" but when you check it, that's not true. That's the experience I have.

Yesterday I had the opportunity to test a new OP8 Pro bought by a friend, that said that his screen doesn't suffer from any issues, but when we tested together, we found the issues in 5 minutes...

Anyway, oneplus can try to improve it via software updates, but since they don't talk about it, I'm not that confident. But sure, they can improve the color calibration / black crush / tints with software updates... By how much? No one knows, and at this point, I think not even Oneplus knows."

Welcome to the community and to reddit :p

I think you should wait for the update and try it. Many people is saying that it completely fixes the issues they were experiencing, so you should give it a try for yourself...

I think black crush is hard to test because I've seen people claiming they suffer from black crush and many times they use as example a YouTube video that have ""black crush"" by itself, because of compressing quality etc.

So in your place I would check first the green tint issue after the update, and if thats fixed, then you have time eventually to test the rest."
