ADHD,f5h82jw,t3_dnnet9,1572201911.0,"Wow. So much. And it's interesting because you're obviously articulate. This is something I struggle with too. I can be articulate when I'm writing in silence but so often in conversation I just find that, exactly like you said, it just feels like that cloud of uncondensed thoughts. (I love how you worded that, so descriptive!).

It can be so frustrating, especially since I often feel like I'm supposed to say something and end up stammering out a response that doesn't make much sense or which isn't actually representative of my thoughts or feelings on the subject. And then when I try to reflect on what it is I have to say the entire subject dissipates under the weight of all of the questions, doubts, uncertainties, and second guessing that rapidly arises along with the thoughts. Then I'm just blank and frustrated and wondering if I'm very, very stupid. It can even affect my relationships because people get frustrated with the things I say, and I do too. Then I feel very low and people pick up on this and it cant kill the energy of a conversation and make it very hard to connect with people. I often feel this impotence, like I don't know who I am or what I have to say about anything and I'm just lost in this fog all the time. I do my best to relax, to keep life simple, to focus on a few things and try to prove to myself that I can form cogent, well informed opinions, and to a degree it is helping my self esteem. But when it comes to arguments or any situation requiring me to think fast and respond with a relevant or useful answer  I often get so flustered I just shut down (think, driving somewhere in high traffic with someone who doesn't know the city as well as I do and I'm expected to know where to turn or what route to take, which I would if I were relaxed, but in the moment I just get scrambled!).

I relate. Mindfulness, habit forming through discipline to create structure in my life, active listening and active reading to improve memory and recall, good sleep, diet and exercise all help me."

I feel deeply offended by some stuff too, even though my experience was shorter, it was still just a bunch of little jabs I didn't deserve. I have some sympathy, or maybe compassion because I know that no one turns out like that if things have gone well in their life, and like you said, they're just children...but I also have to be honest with myself that I'm resentful and hurt.

Forget about having anything they want or being a threat to their ego, no matter how unintentionally.

I was pretty dismissive of street photography in my post by referring to it as ""art"" , which is premature, I do think it's art but if it involves violating people's boundaries and being rude then it crosses in to creepy ""control"" territory and qualifies for a few more labels that are not so flattering as ""art""."

REDDITORSINRECOVERY,er7n7oh,t1_er7bs9i,1560582053.0,"I would say yes but that’s just my opinion, 
In my experience I have to be very active and connected with other people in recovery. The reason is that my twisted thinking and turbulent emotions mean I can’t trust my brain most of the time and if left alone with those old patterns too long they gain strength. I want the opposite to happen so I have to share my struggles with others. Doing so rewires my brain because I get a wiser perspective in my thinking and actions, I feel less alone in my struggles by having a community of fellow travellers and therefore more worthwhile and resilient (isolation lets the demons win the argument which weakens me and causes self loathing and fear), and finding ways to be of service in that community gives me a newfound confidence, and most importantly takes me out of “me”. One of my big problems is too much self focus. The “self” is so highly regarded in our society but there’s no balance just self self self, it’s very unhealthy imo and experience. Some self is necessary but for me it’s a killer.

Hopefully this made sense and had something you find relevant and wasn’t too off topic.
