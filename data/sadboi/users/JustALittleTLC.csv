cats,foeleni,t3_g72rit,1587706924.0,"Things you can do to help get her home:
 - Put her litter tray near the front or back door. She will recognise her own smell and it can help her find her way back
 - Look for her. Most cats stay within a block so check your yard, under your house and all your neighbours.
 - Look for her at night. Using a torch at night will catch the reflection of her eyes and make it easier to see her."

IAmA,fg2zjhl,t1_fg2ybxb,1580463138.0,You mean most of the people you saw outside were people capable of going outside? I think there might be people you can't see who rely on others to bring them groceries. If those others aren't in walking distance then they are probably screwed. Already heard of one person who died because they were disabled and their family was quarantined and therefore unable to reach them to provide care.

AskWomen,fatcgt4,t3_eagm65,1576336889.0,"I have to admit, it depends on my mood. Sometimes I'm mature and just mute and report them. Other times I make my voice even higher and say I'm just 12 and annoy them with that until I get bored (for all the times I used to get asked if I was a girl or a ""twelve""). Sometimes I even go as far as to say crude things about what I did with their dad last night.

I used to hide that I am female to avoid the instant team killing, constant stream of talking about it/abuse and heaps of friend requests but got so sick of having to do that. Hiding that females play games will make it continue to seem rarer than it is. That being said... Sometimes I really appreciate playing with my people who I can truly relax around."

Autistic,f0wpxyj,t3_d6zfz3,1569011802.0,"Both of your questions are tricky. 

Being autistic means he likely has difficultly understanding people's meaning/intentions when they are different to what is being said. Sarcasm is a good example of this. If you can describe tell-tale signs of sarcasm then it's probably teachable. If it requires interpretation of context and ever changing body language then it's going to be more difficult.

With regards to asking about his autism, it's worth keeping in mind that he might not be aware. Even with the best of intentions and with perfect wording to avoid insulting him, if he isn't aware that he is autistic then you could be giving him a nasty surprise by saying anything. Sorry, no suggestions from here.

Edit: spelling"
Autistic,eyb713e,t3_cwejd2,1566977388.0,"My boyfriend is autistic and ADD so support high energy and easily bored. He suggests Meccano as something your son can build with and pull apart. Or the puzzles that have gears and blocks that you need to figure out how to put into certain shapes or pull apart. The problem with the puzzles are that you might need to figure it out one yourself to show him ðŸ˜‹. When he gets older, he might really enjoy putting together and pulling apart engines a the like. Unfortunately there are lots of things he might hurt himself on with an engine at this age but perhaps he would be ok with it. Our friends son is 6 and had pulled apart and reassembled a spare lawn mower engine 130 times and just loves it!"

autism,erd1ikj,t1_ercmo2h,1560728108.0,"I hear it a lot in online gaming as well which infuriates me more than in other settings because:
1) there's a big chance that a higher than average proportion of the people in that community are autistic, and 
2) it's used as in insult to game developers (e.g. ""this map is autistic"", ""this new setting is autism"") which is absolutely stupid since being a game developer is a profession likely to be enhanced by autism!"
