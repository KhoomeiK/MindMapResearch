Taking this shot was tricky, because the snow storm those clouds were part of included 50-70mph winds and subzero temperatures. 
Wasn’t able to take the longer exposure because the wind was so bad."

Photography is one of the things I’m using to combat these negatives in my life, and this prompt challenge seemed like a good way to grow a portfolio and have some fun. 

I posted this originally on insta, but felt like this is more my community. 

Constructive criticism is very appreciated!"

stopdrinking,f774b06,t3_dumhkj,1573443579.0,"I've been on both ends of the spectrum, drink a little and feel fine, or blackout a couple times a month... but regardless of how much I drink, afterwards it always leaves me in a down-swing. I know the saying that ""Alcohol is a depressant"" gets tossed around alot, and as someone who already suffers from severe depression and anxiety, it's the least useful thing to my mental and physical health. 

I'm glad you've been able to make that connection early on. There are studies out there that Alcohol withdrawal, even with no hangover, can cause pretty significant anxiety/depression-like symptoms. 

Any motivator you need to not drink and keep yourself healthy and progressing is good and useful! Proud of you for making the effort.

IWNDYYT!"

Anxiety,f6g2a9r,t3_dr7owf,1572820949.0,"I definitely recommend therapy. Though the catch-22 with working with a therapist is that it a lot like working with a personal trainer; it may take time to find one you vibe with, and all the effort is still on you. Given that Anxiety/Depression leaves us prone to quit, the process of getting the right kind of care can be exhausting. 

For myself, (MDD, GAD, Adult ADHD) a combination of medication, exercise, and monthly counseling has helped a lot. In addition when I notice the anxiety ramping up from, say, a stressful day at work... a few minutes of Box Breathing helps me to refocus and counter a panic attack before it starts. 

(Box Breathing is the practice of breathing in for a 3 count, holding a 3 count, breathing out for a 3 count, then holding the out for a 3 count)"

DecidingToBeBetter,eorp03a,t3_bsty7p,1558810491.0,"I dont remember ever liking myself. I've taken a lot of self-worth from the people who are around me. 

Realizing that; that their approval doesn't actually change my value has been a big step for me.  I'm still not good at it, but positive self-talk has been improving, (E.g. 'I'm kind', 'I'm smart', 'I'm attractive') then following them-up with memories or examples of when I felt that to be true. 

All this kind of comes backs to one of my main mantras lately too, ""Clean space, Clean Face, Clean Headspace"", it's easy to feel shitty about myself when I'm living in a mess, haven't shaved for a few days, or just generally feel grubby."
