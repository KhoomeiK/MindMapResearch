When I tell you a scientific fact your response is “wELL AcTUally IM eXPERiEncED”. It is literally not a medical abnormality. Read something for once. A psychological abnormality is a behaviour that is seen as a deviation from ideal mental health. Being LGBT is not seen as such. 
“I am not against gay people”; “gay people are a cult”.

The definition of agenda is your underlying motives or intentions; in this case which is to portray your self as a victim of LGBT culture and promote the ideology that the community is bad.

Something that might shock you is that science is grounded in facts so classes can actually teach you a thing or two. Maybe you believe the earth is flat or you don’t because science tells you it isn’t. But you can’t use that same logic for gay people because it doesn’t fit your agenda. And you are talking about me not having life experience. I’m literally fucking bi. That’s more life experience in this discussion than you could ever have dude? Wtf. 

And You literally said you like girl on girl. You literally said you’re ok with bi women because it fits your sexual desires. The only reason you respect that specific form of homosexuality is because you can get off on it. All other gays are just “abnormal”.

I might be personally attacking you but it might just be because you are being ignorant as fuck. Maybe you should actually read a thing or two about this before commenting on it. Read unbiased scientific journals. If you don’t want to make that effort then don’t discuss it. Don’t butt in to something you are not qualified to discuss. 

I do take a mandatory ethics course for your information but maybe if you knew a thing or two you’d know that ethics courses have nothing to do with this discussion. It’s more about the legalities behind conducting research."
insanepeoplefacebook,fn6i0n1,t1_fn6gm4v,1586699819.0,"As a psychology major I can assure you medically it is considered a normality. In psychological abnormality has a set of criteria it needs to meet and for a significant amount of time the APA and BPS which are the leading bodies for psychology in the US and UK have both labelled homosexuality as a normality. So yes being gay is normal. In a medical context; a normality is not deviating from what is common. That is a societal context not medical. According to the DSM-V which is the diagnostic manual for mental disorders, homosexuality is not a mental illness. Some countries are behind on science. I don’t think I need to prove that to you. But Sweden isn’t actually one of those countries. Sweden is actually one of the most LGBT progressive countries in Europe and was one of the first countries to legalise gay marriage.
You sound like you think bi-women are some jack off material for you and you don’t sound tolerant at all. “I like lesbian porn” is probably the worst thing you could say to prove you are for gay rights. You just made your self sound massively ignorant and like an asshole. People might have not liked you because you fetishise gay women and you’re not open to discussing things that don’t agree with you. You’re the kind of guy who hits up bi women asking for threesomes. 

So the reason you dated bi women is not because you respect them but because it’s some kinda kink for you which is gross tbh. 

It’s best you dropped out of uni. University is not the place for people who are not open to understanding science and facts. And university if anything is the place for using scientific vocabulary and having discussions about social issues. 
Who you vote for is your business but you do sound like a stereotypical republican ngl. 

You said being gay is a cult then say you are not being offensive. You are not objective. You use opinions as facts. Being objective is not offensive. Being ignorant and spouting offensive opinions is. Nothing is being made worse for anyone. You’re trying to play the victim in a situation you aren’t even apart of.

You can’t win in a discussion with university students because your opinions don’t contribute anything because they are just built on your personal prejudice for a group of people you don’t understand and not facts. As a result people don’t respect your opinions."

If you think we’re weird abnormal cultists, maybe you should stay away from LGBT people in your personal life without intentionally surrounding yourself by them. 
It’s very strange you don’t respect LGBT people if you have dated them. Maybe you should just stick to dating straight women and stay away from gay men if you have no respect for them. But that’s just personal advice. Most people become more accepting when they meet actual LGBT people. It’s a shame you didn’t have the same effect.

A university is not a place where social topics shouldn’t come up in. It’s literally the place for social discussions because it’s an educational setting."

If you hear someone else having a discussion about something LGBT and it doesn’t effect you just stay out of it. No one is gonna force you to be apart of a discussion.

Cisgender is not an “LGBT word” since it actually refers to a non LGBT community. If you think something is “abnormal” that’s your problem not anyone else’s. Wtf is abnormal about being the same gender as your biological sex? People can use medical terms casually. If you don’t want to then don’t do it your self but you can’t gate-keep medical vocabulary. I don’t think cisgender even is a medical term. It probably isn’t. 

If you have some massive problem with a word just don’t use it. I lost brain cells reading your comment. If people use medical terms then maybe they are talking about something medical and if you’re not educated to be a part of medical conversations then don’t. No one is forcing you. 

Also no one calls restlessness Akathisia because Akathisia is a movement disorder. Not just normal restlessness."
insanepeoplefacebook,fn68a17,t1_fn681q3,1586691289.0,Yeah. I didn’t know that. Thanks for letting me know lol. I guess cairn is important to you the way cisgender would be to someone else.
insanepeoplefacebook,fn670jh,t1_fn66nuh,1586689925.0,Yeah maybe it doesn’t need a word but we have words for a lot of things that probably don’t need naming. It’s just a language thing. An absolutely useless word “cairn” means a stack of stones that is regarded a memorial. Does it need to be a word? Probably not. But it is. I guess just don’t use it if it feels useless to you. I personally maybe have used the word cisgender less than a handful of times so you could just not use it unless it’s needed. I have never used cairn but it exists.

insanepeoplefacebook,fhouvrr,t1_fhospgb,1581774648.0,I do exactly that and not really on purpose. It kinda just happens and I used to always fix it if I reread my work but atm since I’m in uni and no one else ever reads what I right on paper I just leave it in and now I just forget to fix it entirely
