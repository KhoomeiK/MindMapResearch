I like it but at the same time it makes me feel both annoyed and confused. 

Annoyed because I have a huge ass independence complex; part of independence, to me, is being strong enough that people don't worry. 

Confused because I was always told that no one, outside of my family, would look out for me but *me*. And, yet, here I am with lots of people (close friends and not) who worry about me and try to look out for me. Meanwhile, my family hardly checked up on me at all before we became estranged.

I mostly let those who worry about me do their thing. Sometimes it annoys me, sure, but I temper myself with the reminder that I'll miss them-worrying and all-when they're gone. Hell, I'll even miss the worrying."

AskReddit,fr3g0zc,t3_gmf7l9,1589856621.0,"I used to dissect people, as I had no understanding of why people did the things they did. And, in my household, unpredictable was hella bad. If I pissed someone off, I was gonna suffer.

Best thing you can do is pay attention to their; 

-  Tone  

- Word choice

- Body language  

- Microexpressions 


Do this for any given scenario, puzzle over what those factors above mean for that person, and then file it away in a kind of mental 'human behavior dictionary'. Eventually, you'll have enough data to be able to know, within a tolerable margin of error, how that person is doing at any given moment.

It's not quite getting in their head, but it is a way of understanding someone.

The dissection comes in with the next list. You cannot properly seek to understand someone, truly understand them, unless you also pay attention to the following factors;  

- Things that piss them off 

   - Do certain words seem to piss them off?? A style of logic that gets on their nerves?

- Things that make them happy

  - Same as above, only replacing negative connotations with positive ones.  

- Any other notable snippets that give you insight into their logic system, what makes them tick, why they do what they do, etc, etc.

Basically, to truly understand someone at a level you are talking about, you need to ask yourself *w h y* all the time. Why did they do this rather than that? Why did this piss them off this time but not that time? Etc, etc, etc. Again, after a bit, you've built a human behavior dictionary. But this time for an individual rather than a species.


That said, I see no need to dissect someone like that unless you are in the kind of situation I was. An abusive household, filled with unpredictable people, where it was crucial you laid as low as you possibly could. Otherwise, it makes me feel rather icky to try and dissect someone like that. After all, they're not a threat. I shouldn't treat them like one.

I don't consciously dissect people anymore but I did for so long that I am sure I subconsciously do it still. Old habits, especially ones that helped you survive, die hard."

As a kid, I was urged to stifle my emotions rather than manage them in a healthy way. I wasn't given physical affection, no one ever told me they were proud of me, and the words ""I love you"" were mustered maybe once every six months **if that**.  Nothing I ever did was good enough for anyone, I was always pushed to do better. 

All of that doesn't even get into the ways I feel myself and my siblings were emotionally abused by our parents or the shitty living conditions we were forced to deal with throughout my young adulthood. Hell, some of my siblings were **born** into those conditions.

All of this has left me wonky. I am anxious, I don't trust people easily, unexpected physical affection (except from a select few people I trust) makes me uncomfortable, people hitting on me/aknowledging that they find me attractive gives me heebe-jeebies sometimes, on and on the list goes.

I know I will be fine. I know I will break out of the depression enough to be successful eventually. But I can't help but wonder, every time I think of my past, if I would have been a stronger person if I hadn't gone through so much shit.

AskReddit,fr06ekt,t3_glwbv2,1589785145.0,"Myself.

I was an emotional and volatile kid. It was hard for me to control it, especially as the attitude of my parents was ""you figure it out"". My mother tried to help, for a time, by buying me self help books. But, even then, she gave up on me eventually. 

For a long time, my emotions and volatility dictated who I was. It was easy to make me happy but it was also just as easy to piss me off (which my siblings did for sport). Additionally, I had social cue issues that stem from  potential Aspergers. In short, I was a mess and didn't get along with anyone.

As a child, I tried desperately to fit in. But, no matter how I tried, I could not control my emotions or mimick the social cues of my family. Everything they did was elusive and felt out of my control, so I lashed out.

As a teenager, I saw how much damage my actions was causing. I was trying to force people who did not understand me to accept me. I was getting angry with them and picking fights. I was getting really depressed, which pissed off my family even more, because of the fact that I could not fit in. So, as a teen, I isolated myself from everyone else in as many ways as I could.

Into my young adulthood, around sixteen or seventeen years old, something finally clicked for me. I had read enough books, spent enough time tamping down my anger, walking in the woods, and picking myself apart for my sins that I could manage to leave my room for short times without issues. But, still, even when my mother admitted I had improved there were issues. If I ever relapsed, if I ever had a moment of weakness, if I argued back when my siblings picked on me, people treated me just the same as before. They had no mercy or tolerance for me. And, perhaps, I cannot entirely blame them. The past is a hard thing to forget and I certainly hadn't forgotten it either. So I continued to isolate, read my books, pick apart my every emotion, and spend as much time in the woods as I could.

As a young adult, I feel that I'm finally stabilized enough that I don't cause issues for my friends. For me, that marked my adulthood. When I left my family, who still treated me the same as when I was a bad kid, and joined the real world to find out that people think I am **good**. That I am mostly level headed, can reel in my emotions, and actually want to be around me. They trust me to make adult decisions, do adult tasks.... To them, even if I am a bit younger than them, I am an adult.

I'm still conquering myself. I still have things I need to work on. And, really, I still fear that one day my friends will see me as the child my family did. But, at the very least, I do feel I have enough control over myself to warrant calling myself an adult."

1. You teach them that violence is an answer when you cannot get someone else to behave in a way you want.

I'd listen to your doc, it sounds like right now they're one of the few people who have your back. I'd ask your doc what resources you have available for rent assistance, etc, etc.

As for your mother not wanting you to move out, as long as you're an adult I say fuck her. You'll probably need to do it in secret, be prepared to only take what you absolutely need at first, and you may even consider going ahead and doing it *now*. There is a lockdown, sure, but if it will do you more good to get out (which, legally, you are still allowed to do lockdown or not) then I would do it as long as you are financially able. 

If your mother gives you trouble about moving out, move out with the bare necessities and have a police officer escort you back to get your stuff. Legally, as an adult, you are entitled to your things.

I suggest you check out /r/raisedbynarcissists . Most people there were raised with families/parents like ours and will have good advice for you, etc.

I got lucky in that my mother **was** pissed at my brother *at first*. But, even then, it was very clear her first priority was *him*. She only offered therapy for me once, though I didn't take her up on it because I knew she'd impose rules about what I could and could not say. She never offered it again, even when it became clear that I needed it. 

Which gets into my first piece of advice. I don't know how long ago this happened (it'll be two years in June, for me) but you need to see a therapist ASAP. The times I talked to a therapist *after* I moved out helped me, a lot, but I would have been so much better off if I could have gone sooner.

Second, absolutely get out as soon as you can. These people are repeat offenders. My brother did it to me, a younger sister, and peeped on the youngest. If you have younger sisters, keep an eye on them. Your brother may try it with them.

No, we never do heal. I'll bear these mental scars for the rest of my life. I can't change my clothes if I think anyone might see me, as I know my brother peeped on me while I changed. I go so far as to drape a blanket over my car door, if I change while camping or after having caved, because it freaks me out not to.

AskReddit,fq4veav,t3_ggoysp,1589085073.0,"When I was nineteen, my oldest brother groomed me. I was a stupid and naive nineteen year old who desperately craved positive attention, especially from my oldest brother as he fucking h a t e d me, and so when he gave me it in return for speaking about sexual things I didn't think twice about it. In retrospect, I should have but he was careful. He presented himself as the caring older brother, telling me things about myself Mom should have but hadn't, and acted like he was doing this for me rather than himself. 

It started with him noticing my pub hair while I was in a swimsuit and telling me most women shave that (a thing Mom had never told me about. It ended with him, months later, asking me to masturbate in front of him. 

But, my oldest brother's betrayal was not the worst one. I never expected it from him, sure, but I knew he hated me. I knew he had a habit of using me for his own gain. I should never have trusted him.

The betrayal aspect of this is in the way my mother reacted. When I told her, she made me go out and sit in our car so we could speak about it. Once I was done, she told me to get the oldest of my younger sisters so she could ask her if my oldest brother had done the same to her.  After, she made me swear not to tell **any** of my siblings what had happened. She told me she wasn't going to kick my brother out because that would ruin his life. All I ever got my my oldest brother was a half-assed apology and him being a **new** kind of asshole to me. He acted like it was my fault, was really cold, and **everyone** knew something was up but no one knew what.

I felt so horrid, keeping that shameful secret of what my brother had tried to do *and* having to live with him still, that I became depressed. I had behavioral issues, I acted out, and eventually my mother lost her patience. She told me, one day, that she was kicking **me** out. She was tired of my attitude, she was tired of me fighting with everyone, she was tired of me moping, I had to *g o*. I sat outside for an hour, during the summer, and got bit up by mosquitos because she had even told me I wasn't allowed in the house at that moment...

Six months later, I found out that; 

- My oldest brother HAD tried to do the same thing with my oldest younger sister **BEFORE** he tried to do it to me and Mom had told **HER** not to tell me (Mom found out after he did it to me)

- My oldest brother had, later, peeped on my **twelve** year old sibling, which prompted my mother to kick him out *finally*

It hurts me deeply, to this day, that my mother was willing to let **three** of her daughters become her sons victim before she kicked him out. That she kept my sister and I from finding solace in one another. And, most of all, that she wasn't willing to ruin my brother's life but she had no issue ruining mine...

Meanwhile, my friends went above and beyond to make sure I was okay.

She started out somewhat friendky and then, wham, one day her story changed. I scare her, I scare her cat, she wants to move out... The girl hadn't even signed the lease yet as this had happened in the span of about a month or so. I was upset, as I hated to think I had been scaring her all this time out realizing it, and was understanding. She said she was gonna move out ASAP.

A month and a half goes by and rent is due, but she is still there. So I ask her what the deal is and she says she changed her mind. She was overreacting, I don't scare her, her cat was just anxious... So, she stays.

In the meantime she complains about taking out the trash because it is too heavy, acts really cold towards me, and is otherwise just kind of a pain in the ass. I continue to walk on eggshells because I think maybe I'm still making her anxious.

Any time I confront her with an issue, though, she blows up on me. First instance was she was using my ziplock bags and I was concerned that I wasn't going to be able to keep track of my things anymore; her response was that I needed to buy my own cat litter and cat food (which I had offered to do, anyway, many times). She also just generally found things to be angry with me about. Later, when she calmed down, she admitted she had only said those things to be spiteful.

Second instance, she left for *four freaking days* without telling me. Which if it wasn't for our cats, I could give a shit less. She's home more often than I so, normally she takes care of them and I help when I can. But I didn't know she was gone, so it was a day or so before I realized I needed to do it. When I spoke to her about it, after she finally came back, she blew up on me again. Got after me for seemingly like I don't like her, I don't ever take care of the cats, etc, etc, even going so far as to say as an American I am not adaptable. Once more, she eventually admitted she didn't mean half of what she had said. She just didn't like that I had brought a conflict to her and had gotten angery. 

Like, I'm no fucking saint. I am sure I have done *plenty* wrong throughout the year we've lived together. And, well, my mental health is an asshole a lot these days But, like, at the very least I've tried to keep the peace...
