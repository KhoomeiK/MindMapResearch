However, the past few months ive been bleeding pretty consistently, about every 28-35 days-ish for anywhere between 3 - 6 days, minimal bleeding as opposed to the massacre-esque BS from before.

I feel so guilty. Ive been fluey for a while and called in Tuesday and Thursday and was still fluey yesterday but had declined the shift for another reason (being triggered). I'm mentally a bit better today but still getting my ass kicked with this cold fluey thing. I need a Dr certificate ASAP. 

Ive been trying to identify what i am feeling and kind of just sitting with it. Its taken me a long time to start picking up on the changes and ive been able to stop myself fully spiralling but im not sure how other than just being more aware."

I also have client notes which has given me a head start and I had a phone call with colleague before my shift and they filled me in on a lot of ""do's and don't' such as terminology, personal space, eating, etc.

In a similar vein, we fostered a girl my age who was not raised with proper hygiene practices. Her and her sister lived with us for a few years and in that time my mum taught her how to practice good habits, just as she had done with her daughter's. It didn't stick. To this day, she smells absolutely putrid. I can't even explain the smell. I honestly don't think she's bought one stick of deodorant in her life. And yet, it isn't actually her fault. It was her dickhead of a mother and then being in massive group homes before she came to us. :("
