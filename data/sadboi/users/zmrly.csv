 I remember about my last stay at psych hospital it was briefly and after a suicidal attempt, the therapist was a young male and I refused to talk to him and he even threatened to call the police because suicidal was a react if I didn‚Äôt talk to him, the nurses used to ignore me and even make fun of me when they found out my family refused to come see me, they used to pull me out of the bed and say stuff like ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs not like you can complain to someone‚Äù ‚Äúyou need attention because your family abandoned you‚Äù. It was terrifying. 

I‚Äôm running out of options in my life right now and I have sent a request to go to a psych hospital again because I‚Äôm basically homeless and shit, but I‚Äôm terrified because when I go to those places I feel like they shut me down, they take the light from inside me and just keep me drugged and the spiral in my mind keeps going but I can‚Äôt express it, but with it goes all my common needs like my creativity, I love writing and reading. Inpatient therapy is like a social suicide for me, never been as good as outpatient. I don‚Äôt trust people in hospitals, there‚Äôs nice ones but there‚Äôs so many frustrated people working there."
