While women have the freedom to have their emotions, they‚Äôre looked down on as weaker for having emotion. This is why female politicians have to act like robots when running for office, to prove that they‚Äôre not just a crazy over-emotional woman.

Men on the other hand aren‚Äôt allowed to experience emotion at all, and if they do, the pressure to push it down is even greater. For some reason, anger is okay. It‚Äôs a really dangerous situation and I think it‚Äôs part of the reason we see more suicides with men. 

Ultimately we need to stop acting like emotion is a feminine thing and accept that it‚Äôs a human thing. We all have emotions and we all deserve to feel them fully and get support from each other."

Is there anything that can help you feel more comfortable falling asleep? Maybe a different position, place, or time of day/night?

unpopularopinion,fq82yq3,t3_ghan7n,1589157434.0,"I think this is highly dependent on if the mother is also working a full-time job, and if she is still the one doing most of the parenting/housework, which is unfortunately the case for a lot of working women (if you want sources for that I can link ya).

But if you're talking about stay at home moms, yeah, that's not gonna be toughest job by a long shot.

Edit: This is not to say that being a parent is not challenging. It‚Äôs absolutely not just relaxing in the park and watching Frozen. There are mountains of evidence that the environment a child lives in as well as the skills learned in the early years will predict future academic and interpersonal success, so anyone who is caring for and educating children is doing one of the most important jobs in the world."

EatingDisorders,fq44e7r,t3_ggd3kb,1589073521.0,"I don't have a lot of advice to offer, but I do know that cravings can be triggered by low blood sugar, which can happen if you don't eat for a long period. If you're not eating much throughout the day, you could be getting cravings in the evening from low blood sugar. 

Otherwise, definitely talk to a counselor! Feeling guilty and secretive about food is definitely abnormal, and very stressful. I've been there. I used to have a bunch of secret spots for food in my room and I felt so ashamed. No one should have to feel bad about something that keeps them alive, so I hope you do go and seek help. It's great that you've talked to your parents already."

I agree with you that people who use it as an insult are annoying, and that it's disrespectful. Which is why I wouldn't tell someone upset about it to just wait a few years until it's less common."
BPD,fpy4e4n,t3_gg4gkm,1588995752.0,"I feel like this sub gets real circle-jerky pretty often, but then posts like yours reel it back in. People will get sick of those posts eventually.

But yes, they get on my nerves too. It's not called a disorder because it's fun. I've gotta say that at my worst times, I've been insufferable to others and myself. I think the positive posts are reflective of people's actual personalities when symptoms aren't occurring. We can't have the positive without getting the symptoms under control. You can't be full of wholesome love while having a breakdown because someone's not texting us back.

Drink some water, get some sleep. With any luck and some tylenol, you'll feel a bit better in the morning."
