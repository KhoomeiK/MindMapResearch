I am not good at taking my own advice, but I know when you’re going through loss, it’s always best to reach out to people rather than internalize it. So you’ve already made that step!

The next step is to allow yourself to feel all of those horrible emotions you are bottling up and allow yourself to feel and acknowledge the pain. And continue to talk to the people you trust about it. 

After that, there is no good answer. But you will slowly start to move on, despite how painful and hard that may seem.

I know there are people that love because when I’m up, I’m REALLY up, and feel so grateful for my loved ones. Unfortunately, when I’m down the negative thoughts are just so loud I can’t hear any of the rational thoughts telling me to hang in there and reminding me that people do care. 

I’ve been feeling particularly low the last few days and reading this meant a lot! Thank you so much for the reminder that I’m loved! My best friend just got into town  today( she lives in NY and I live in SF). I’m even more excited to be with her now.

TwoXChromosomes,ezs867e,t3_d1s7rq,1568084605.0,"Ok I’m gonna be really honest here. Upon starting to read this my immediate reaction was to just go back to scrolling. I read “scruffy guy,” and immediately thought to myself, well yea, part of public transportation is dealing with the homeless/mentally ill. 

I immediately clicked back to my feed with a super negative attitude towards OP, thinking this isn’t a big deal and most mentally ill people aren’t even violent. 

But then I caught myself! Who am I to decide when someone feels threatened? I have experienced that fear numerous times as a single woman living in a city, whether it’s on the bus, the train or just walking home. Needless to say, I was being an asshole and decided I should finish the story. 

The conclusion I came to is that whether the man on the train was going to hurt OP or not, her fear and discomfort was totally real at that moment and while many may have been quick to dismiss or judge (like I did), there were others that recognized the fear and acted. That, to me, is one of the most beautiful things about people and definitely restored my faith in humanity. 

So thanks OP, for reminding me that it is ok to feel scared, and even more so, ok to step up when you sense others are feeling the same!"
