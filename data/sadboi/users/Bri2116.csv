offmychest,fp0vqkq,t1_fp0vkgo,1588218010.0,Ya like the only people that know weâ€™re doing stuff is like our friend group but we have other friends outside of it Iâ€™m just very confused and I donâ€™t want to start catching feelings for him because Iâ€™m scared of him leaving me
offmychest,fp0vhhr,t1_fp0vczm,1588217845.0,But then again he doesnâ€™t want anyone to know about us like if I send someone streaks and it shows his face heâ€™ll get a bit mad and Iâ€™ll have to act like Iâ€™m mad too so he doesnâ€™t think I did it on purpose
mentalhealth,fnwt80w,t3_g4djqe,1587324979.0,"I understand your feeling. I have bipolar depression and it sucks. It sucks knowing that at whatever moment I go from happy to sad. I havenâ€™t self harmed in 3 months and I know the feeling of wanting to do it all over again. Currently Iâ€™m going through rough times as my pet died 4 months ago and itâ€™s still hard to process. Everyday I feel like Iâ€™m losing touch with her. Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m not the only one that feels this way. I just know that we can get through it together. It may take awhile but I promise you, suicide shouldnâ€™t be the way. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide 3 times and every time i tried I felt guilty afterwards for trying to take my life. You will get through this. It may feel like itâ€™s taking forever because thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m going through but all I know is that weâ€™re gonna get through this together. Youâ€™re not alone"
offmychest,fnasru3,t1_fna9t8u,1586803183.0,I would wait until youâ€™re sure you want to lose it and make sure that itâ€™s with someone you trust and love. My regret is doing it with someone that I have a thing with. Iâ€™m not even dating the person. Just make sure you really want it because if you feel like youâ€™re going to regret it Then you should wait

mentalhealth,fir9bhb,t3_f9e4qz,1582659945.0,I hear it every day. I pray that itâ€™ll go away but it never does so I just learn to deal with it. Itâ€™s probably not the best idea but idk what else to do
