SuicideWatch,fbe3vkn,t1_fbe2df6,1576777614.0,It won't get better. Happiness is a lie a beautiful illusion destroyed by solitude when you see others and yourself for what you truly are which is a blip on the cosmic timeline. Sure I would love to be deluded but I can't trust people and spend most of my day distracting myself with academia and programming. This is probably the worst time to be alive when things are so comfortable your mind is diseased with nothingness
SuicideWatch,fbdx3ki,t1_fbdqmsm,1576773285.0,Thanks but I'm not sure of what to say generally I don't have opinions or feelings as such just painfully empty and alone. Thanks a lot for your reply. I'm just looking for something engaging enough to distract me from reality.
SuicideWatch,fbdwlff,t1_fbdr34z,1576772960.0,I have seen therapists. Multiple infact. I become completely blank when I'm asked about how I feel or when someone asks me to dig deeper. The numbness has taken over me so entirely to the point I can't be sure I'm even awake. It's like I have multiple consciousness but none of them have access to speech and when I journal I go blank again. It absolutely sickens me when people appreciate me because I've only known abuse and being a burden on people. People around me just think I'm a freak or as an object for dull gossip. Thanks for your reply you're a beautiful person.
SuicideWatch,fbdd9u4,t3_ebspd5,1576758288.0,I will never be happy just distracted momentarily and I'm so sick of people thinking it's a phase. I can't get out of bed and I've successfully isolated myself from everyone. People may have it worse than me but I'd rather be anyone else at this point I'm so sick of myself
