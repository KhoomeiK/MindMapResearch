MuslimLounge,fqpcvw7,t3_gjcpf1,1589542899.0,"First, don’t stress over the over-critical radicals on the internet who say that your Islam is null and void—no one can judge your faith in your heart except Allah. 

Second, our religion is not built upon the basis of magic. It’s based on the truth—reason, logic, and so much more. 

Third, if you already believe in God and that he created you, what do you have to lose in believing those things about Adam’s height, etc? 

God creates miracles everyday. Even the existence of the various consistent cycles of nature, sun, and moon—not going off its tracks are pointing towards a maintainer (creator—God). 

Also, the miracles and signs of God’s existence are countless—why must God create a special grand miracle just for you or your generation to see? He has already sent his final messenger and has already given so much for us to reflect on.

Would you question a successful company’s CEO’s competence in leading his/her company or demand that he/she appear at your door to prove his/her competence or demonstrate his/her powers?

Salaam,

As a 28 year-old man, I've been having difficulty finding a potential spouse. Looking for insight as to what I can do to improve my bio and chances of finding a woman.

Currently on a Muslim matrimonial app, I managed to write 7 short paragraphs of my bio openly and in a witty manner.

But am I being too open? I'm just trying to be efficient in the matchmaking process as no one wants to waste their time in having conversations only to find out they wish they knew about some of these things from the start--but I understand 7 paragraphs (albeit short) and my level of openness may be too much for many people.

I made it virtually clear that:

* I am helpful, affectionate, and entertaining
* Am not a US citizen/perm resident (a DACA recipient), at the same time not someone who will leave his wife and children once he gets his citizenship status, etc.
* Have trouble waking up for Fajr, but try to do so every time
* Am in retail as I do not yet have a stable career despite having a bachelor's, and mentioned what field I have been trying to get into.
* Am 5'7""
* and through pictures, i made it clear that i have a shaved bald head, along with photos of me in snapbacks.

Jazak Allahu Khairan."

For me there are couple of reasons I don’t opt for hair systems:

- I easily sweat
- I’ll get dizzy easily as I already get dizzy easily enough from sinus pressures, fast metabolism, etc. 
- having to wash the damn thing, possibly dry it, and have to go to the salon to have it glued to my head?
- human hair is praised more, but is viewed negatively in Islam

So what I started doing few years back is shaving my head once a week. Yeah some people make fun of the shiny head and parents tell me to actually keep the hair even though I tell em it looks worse that way—I’ve grown to care less and less about it as I’ve grown up. It’s too much of a hassle trying to hide it, so I now seldom do it with my snapbacks. We’re almost 30 dude. Give it some more years, and the women around will be less pickier and will be more inclined to overlook balding men. 

It is said that a good number of women don’t mine bald men as long as they don’t hide it. 

Happy to know you overcame your cancer (or so I assume). I thought cancer patients regrow the hair after the passing side effects of medicine and/or therapy? Either way, if it will eventually regrow, you’ll be more fortunate than those of us who have lost it due to genetics."

Your rewards for abstinence from the physical interactions with the same sex are gonna be HUGE (InshaAllah) in comparison to a straight guy like me who easily feels no sexual attraction towards men.

Sheikh Yasir Qadhi and Shabir Ally opened my eyes to this and I am now more mindful of feelings of homosexuals, and am especially respectful of those such as you who are abstaining from the homosexual actions. If you are afraid of the stigma, I think just sitting down with your folks (if they give you a hard time about it), and saying that it’s your personal choice and that if they truly care about you they will respect that. No need to go into the detailed reasons nor even lie. If they keep prying, tell them, “I just told you why. It’s my personal choice as an adult, and I will be much happier and comfortable without a spouse.”

I don’t think either of them can be blamed as we choose to do what we feel is right ultimately.

I think it all comes down to individual perception. Religious scrupulosity has hell as a fear whereas moral scrupulosity deals with the action in and of itself without blowing it up to a fear of like hell.

Scrupulosity,fh8a0jg,t3_f1ofvc,1581355288.0,"In the same boat as you— fear of hell and connecting sins or what I assume are sins that are illogical in reality, but makes complete sense to me in my little world in my head, called OCD. In any case, remember that any action done, is generally judged by your intention—not by intrusive/uncertain thoughts. And it’s God who determines heaven or hell for one, not your thoughts and feelings. We all have to live with the uncertainty of heaven or hell—but constantly worrying about hell and connecting it to everything makes life miserable. 

I know Catholicism encourages confession of sins to the priest, but ultimately everything is between you and God.

Are you going to therapy? I have clinical OCD, take pills for it and going to therapy for it. Therapy is a slow process but I hope it helps you both and I. 

I also work retail and a 4-year degree is not sufficient for what I’m trying to get into. UX Design. I understand the pain of anxiety with and without fast-paced jobs and not knowing what will happen, doubting yourself, etc. 

Another thing, try to focus on yourself and health first and try to find someone who will like you for yourself. Personally, I don’t care how much degrees a woman has nor how much money she makes. All I would want is that she shows initiative in working on growing in some form. Your big career goals come later after your health and a life partner, IMO. And a wise Redditor once said it’s what you do outside of your job that really matters (not saying that all jobs are meaningless).

MuslimMarriage,fh57lj8,t1_fh54k9n,1581285795.0,"I agree. I don’t care if a woman has no degree nor even if she doesn’t have a job, as long as she shows initiative in that she’s working on acquiring it."
Scrupulosity,ffpl9od,t3_eucqlp,1580097827.0,"I’m a Muslim and have been in the same boat as you. In any case, remember that any action done, is generally judged by intention by God, not intrusive/uncertain thoughts. I’m sure you eating a birthday cake has nothing to do with its original meaning.

OCD,ffo4a4k,t3_eucx9r,1580073986.0,"Hey man, I’m similar to you in that my family also doesn’t fully understand me having OCD, no matter how many times I explain it to them. My mom has been the most critical in my family about it, and I’ve snapped a few times as a result. 

At the same note, I love her. I am closest to her among all of my family members. Part of this is due to the reason that the religion I practice (Islam) teaches us to be kind and dutiful to parents. 

Cutting her off for that statement might make you wish later that you hadn’t done it. Especially when you will look back in hindsight—you’ll realize that she simply doesn’t understand how it is to be in your shoes, but didn’t mean to hurt you nor want you to cut her off.

9 months in their bellies and beyond, they have done so much for us. Had they wished, they could have cut us off and given us up upon birth, and we would then be at the mercy of God knows who. But they chose not to. I advise you to unblock and take just a lil bit of time to recuperate from your anger and reach out to her."
OCD,ffo1sng,t1_ffo15mw,1580073286.0,Lol. It’s not your typical match-making event. It’s purpose is to find marriage.

OCD,ff5kkje,t1_ff5kctj,1579597338.0,Think of it this way. Your parents won’t be doing the work of helping you get better. It would be the  therapist or pills :)
OCD,ff5jyjn,t3_erqe0z,1579596454.0,All the best bro
OCD,ff5isl2,t3_erqe0z,1579594814.0,"Bro, do not blame yourself. I’ve had OCD since I was 10 and I am now a grown-ass man. I’ve been through stages of blaming myself etc—it is not your fault! OCD is an illness like catching a cold or the flu—no one plans to have it! 

I’ve had some of the similar fears as you and many others in different spheres and craziness. Your first step is to see a psychiatrist and/or therapist (preferably a professional Psychologist). If money is an issue, go to your school counselor/clinic/community and ask if they can recommend free or low cost services. Your health matters. Please don’t blame yourself, man, count your blessings even the tiniest ones, recite affirmations, pray if you believe in God, meditate, seek professional help, and you will see a huge difference. All the best man."
OCD,ff5ig9z,t3_erqh3x,1579594355.0,"You sound young and like myself when I was 16. Although my OCD is all over the place in different varieties and not HOCD, we share the anxiety associated with the disorder. 

Your health matters, and if your family won’t understand that you need professional help, then you gotta be the captain of your own ship, which is your body—your brain specifically. and if you live in a country where there are many resources available even for free, then do not hesitate to seek help. Whether it’s your school counselor, local clinic, etc, there are low cost and free options. Seek help, medication can help and therapy can too. Medication made a big difference for me. And affirmations. 

If this helps at all, ask yourself this. “If I’m truly gay/lesbian, wouldn’t I already have done MULTIPLE sexual acts with the same sex by now?”  I’m sure your answer will be no. Everyone has intrusive thoughts, it’s just us who have OCD struggle dismissing them more than those without OCD."
OCD,fett6ss,t3_eqlcbm,1579379782.0,can actually relate to those fears from my past
