relationship_advice,fqywcsj,t3_gloy9f,1589755683.0,"Just a disclaimer, I’m not encouraging abusive relationships in any way. And by the time a relationship gets that bad, the best thing to do *is* to leave.

But if you do choose to stay, it is totally possible to turn everything around. My boyfriend and I started having lots of issues during the last half of our first year together. Things were borderline abusive at time. It was only a few fights during these 6 months but one is already one too many. During these arguments, things were yelled, people were pushed, glasses were smashed, he punched my arm one time because I yanked the steering wheel while he drove, he put me in an arm lock one time because I took something out of his hand so he could pay attention to me, just a lot of awful things. 

And as I sit here, typing this out, I’m aware of how nasty this all sounds, I really am. And yes technically back in the day we both were crazy for not leaving each other. But we’re both good people, we really are. We just carried a lot of childhood trauma that we imposed on each other. To this day, we still feel awful for the shit we put each other through, but things are completely different now like you said with your relationship. We both worked on our baggage and became better people for ourselves and each other. 

We handle things in a healthy way and it wasn’t easy as I’m sure you understand. Turning a toxic relationship into a beautiful one really is such a rigorous task and I’m happy you and your boyfriend were able to do that (:"

Sometimes things seem extremely difficult but if you shift your perspective you’ll see they might be pretty simple. And that’s what happened here, and they helped me see that. 

If you and a bunch of other people can’t help me, that’s fine, because there’s so many others that can. I didn’t come here to disclose my personal issues with my boyfriend, I just don’t feel comfortable disclosing that.

relationship_advice,fpn9ys7,t3_gefnp6,1588755426.0,"Honestly, not to sound harsh or anything, but just focus on working on yourself. Get yourself clean. You’re 17 and I don’t wanna sound like that person but I’m about to be that person, most of what happens in your teenage years is bullshit that won’t matter. Also, in retrospect, you’ll realize those relationships weren’t that big a deal. I’m not saying teenagers cant form meaningful deep connection, but I will say not to let them affect you that much. People come and go. Sometimes even if a person is right, the timing wasn’t, so it’s ok to let go. That person might come back and if they don’t, it’s for the better. Trust me when I say that you’ll look back and realize it wasn’t that important in the big picture. Learn to let people go, that’s advice I’d give my past self if I could. I too got too attached and hurt extremely bad when I lost people. Don’t do that."

You could wear them with jeans or your general favorite type of pants. Same with tops. No one is gonna look at you weird for wearing your every day cute clothes, for a lot of people it’s the first and possibly last time going. No one is gonna spend money on “shooting clothes” just for one day. Just don’t over do it bc it may be a little silly and uncomfortable. 

So long story short, just wear whatever makes you feel good and pretty as long as it’s not over the top and a nuisance for you. If you’re used to wearing something entirely different, make up for it in makeup no pun intended and with your hair. Just remember you’ll wear those big ear covers for protection.
