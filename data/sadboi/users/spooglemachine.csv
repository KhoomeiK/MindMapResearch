iamatotalpieceofshit,fkr63fx,t3_fk1a8z,1584462570.0,"Actually they are not working unpaid. Richard Branson has asked them to take 8 weeks unpaid leave, but won’t leave them short for cash, the deficit in pay will be spread over the next 6 months of their salary to reduce the impact to staff and to the business. Oh, but they are still loosing 2 months of pay. Yes, but can you imagine how big the explosion of travel will be when al these restrictions are lifted. They will have overtime coming out of their arses. You know, this is being done so they ALL can go back to a job after this worrying time without any layoffs. Some say that maybe Richard Branson could afford to cover this cost of full pay, but I personally, am not a wealth management advisor, financial advisor or HR specialist, but I really really doubt that he has the cash flow to sustain this.  What I do know is as a business Virgin Atlantic are taking reasonable steps to tackle a problem without affecting their staff too much, but protecting their business so it doesn’t have the same fate as other airlines who are not paying their staff at all anymore as they are no longer in the skies."

He may have paid a private provider to test him, which he is fully entitled to. I have been tested as I am unwell and work for the NHS, my fiancé has been tested by her work medical insurance as she is also unwell. He has paid for a test or has it covered on private medical insurance."

Both honeymoon and stag do to destinations in Europe have just been cancelled. We are still waiting to see what happens to the wedding... we have been saving for 4 years to have our dream wedding. Also, our two week 5* honeymoon could be in jeopardy too. I would just like to give her some snuggs. You know just let her know that no matter what happens, I still love her and everything can be rearranged.

Edit: Destinations, not detonations."
