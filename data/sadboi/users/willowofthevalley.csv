I'm a lot more flexible and have a higher endurance than in previous years which makes me happy. In general, I just want to be healthy and move my body as much as possible in a positive way as I get closer to 30 than my early 20s."
xxfitness,fnti3jd,t3_g3rz9l,1587242100.0,"I struggled to find a long term way to successfully exercise in an un-harmful way until I was 22. Prior to that, I'd had an eating disorder from 8-22 so I was always calorie counting, binge eating and doing ineffective work outs (random running,cardio, etc which is fine but not while binging) in heavy layers. All I got was dizzy and I was still ""skinny fat"". It wasnt until I met my now husband that I learned beginning lifting and strength training and gradually became stronger and leaner over time! I'm relatively short i think (5'3) so despite weighing the same as i did in college (135-145) people often think i lost a lot more since I have a lower BF now. A few years ago I reached my goal weight of 125 but was disappointed at how, imo, unflattering bring that small looked on my frame- I have very muscular legs so I looked curveless with big legs. I stopped thinking in terms of numbers and am more interested in increasing my strength, eating healthy and just appreciating my body for what it is blessed with being able to do. I still fight binge habits sometimes but my ED is mainly behind me. I get nervous because I have to start a grad program soon and know my fitness levels may change with a schedule. When that happens I'll continue to fit in what I can and eat healthy. I don't know how other female lifters feel but I definitely get insecure about my smaller chest and, after children, may consider implants but I try not to get hung up about it."

xxfitness,fncjzjz,t3_g0ms9i,1586838699.0,"As many others have said, split squats are awesome! Hard at first but great. I personally love ballet squats which require no weight, but can add it, and my trainer taught me a variety of lunges which are primarily body weight. I suffer from anxiety as well and the fact that you're so aware of your triggers is really important. I admire your inner strength to truly reflect on your insides and outsides as maintaining both of those is a huge challenge in general for a lot of people, myself included.  I'm a gym goer typically but I've started to fall in love with home work outs during this quarantine and there are so many awesome home work outs you can start with. I, too, am a big thighed woman who is naturally smaller buttocked but the exercises I mentioned helped me a lot in that area. While it will never be as big as my calves or thighs, its definitely gotten curvier and firmer with time. I lift heavy now but I started off training in my then boyfriends basement until I felt confident to try the gym and gradually expanded to heavy lifting. You certainly don't have to lift heavy as all that matters is that you are moving your body in as way that makes you happy and is helping you reach your goals. :) Take it day by day and remember that you can always reach out here for support anytime!"

I know it's a very common issue for many women. I know other companies sell boric acid suppositories and probiotics. Also, i hope she feels comfortable stopping the constant tampon use as 1. That has to be expensive AND uncomfortable and 2. Women are supposed to naturally secrete fluid. She is lucky to have such a caring partner and I hope her infections get better!

We both have very healthy social lives but for awhile after we moved out of her house (as we met as broke college kids so we lived there for a few years) it was automatically slated for every Sunday that we would go over there. They have a healthy relationship and I genuinely love my now mother in law but I'd dread being there every weekend. Truthfully I don't even know if it was her idea or his but gradually I just started going less and less (every two weeks usually). I had very similar reasons to you; wanting to relax at home or seeing friends. My now husband and I had a few fights about it at first but now if I don't go no one is hurt or upset. He will typically go on his own as they lioe to watch football together. I'm not really sure how you two have spoken about it but mine just needed a fee reminders that he was welcome to spend his time there but that, personally, sitting on the couch being forced to watch football with no other options was incredibly uninteresting to me every weekend. We will actually be moving back in there to save for a house and, while I love her, it will be quite interesting to live there again...at any rate, I wish you luck with this, OP! Please know you aren't alone and you are not in the wrong for not wanting to go every week. I hope he respects your views and stops pressuring you or ignoring your thoughts on this. There is nothing wrong with being close to your family, and its definitely a great thing, but space is good too!"

As for your fiancee, I highly reccomend Boric Acid suppositories, a probiotic pill and a sensitive wash.

I wish you two luck and I hope I helped a little. It may take time before it goes away but the boric acid suppositories saved my sexual intimacy, esteem, physical and general mental health. I rarely have any ph imbalances now and didnt need to drastically change my diet or routine (although when I eat too much sugar or drink too much I do get an occasional flare up). There is hope out there!"
suggestmeabook,ezrab1t,t3_d1rwx6,1568070926.0,I completely understand your sisters plight! I have extreme anxiety and it makes watching or reading media difficult. The things that might not seem triggering to others can send me into a panic attack. I'm currently trying to think of precise titles but please let your sister know she isnt alone! If she enjoys romance I read a very sweet and fun book called The Bride Test.
WomensHealth,ezmgx9z,t1_ezmgcpm,1567991747.0,The vitamins really helped me! I suffered with it for almost a full year off and on before finding Love Wellness thanks to a kind redditor. I remember crying on lunch break as I was posting and believing it would never go away. It's awful to feel there is no solution to the problem but I'm hopeful the suppositories will help others! Being a woman is honestly a nightmare sometimes. :(
WomensHealth,ezmd5pq,t1_ezkxoy8,1567990259.0,"Boric acid suppositories saved my vaginal health too! I also use a PH balancer from Love Wellness, as well as probiotics. Love Wellness is a bit more expensive but I know that there are cheaper brands at the local Target, Rite Aide you can get. It's an extremely frustrating situation but please don't give up. If you take the suppositories and supplements and still see results I would tell your mom you need to see a specialist. It's so hard when others don't take your concerns seriously but please know that you aren't alone. Good luck!"
WomensHealth,ezfvwve,t3_d0zuw9,1567885259.0,They screen first then treat if they see anything!
WomensHealth,ezfvu61,t3_d0zuw9,1567885206.0,"There are treatment centers depending on your location. They can be pricey but they are effective and so helpful! I had it a few weeks ago and they helped me immensely. Mine scheduled a follow up screening a week after as well to make sure everything is still good. It's a reality uncomfortable and, for me, anxious feeling but it will be ok!"
smallbooblove,eya5b56,t3_cwdb18,1566958388.0,That dress is perfect on you! Yellow is definitely your color. 😍
love,ey3sdxd,t3_cvbibq,1566772477.0,"I think a simple guideline is being friends as well as bf/gf/partners/etc. The truth is that every day might not feel romantic but if you share your laughter, happiness and general life stories with each other the non romantic moments are just as enjoyable. I'm not an expert but I've found this is the base of most successful relationships I know. Never not hold hands, kiss and say I love you though even when you're angry or tired. Sex isn't necessary every day but some kind of physical intimacy is really important."
BobsBurgers,ey3b4io,t3_cv7k90,1566759954.0,This is wonderful! Happy anniversary 😊 You're very talented.
90DayFiance,ey1aezn,t1_exula4x,1566694227.0,"Finslly, someone with common sense!"
90DayFiance,ey1acjx,t3_cu3i3b,1566694171.0,"She is an abusive POS plain and simple. Jorge is also one but he is an abuse victim regardless. How so many people defend her actions because she is pretty or ""honest"" kills my soul.  I'm glad others see this at least..."
SkincareAddiction,exvbf3p,t3_cufa75,1566596257.0,I'm 26 and can only hope to look like this at 50!😍
smallbooblove,ewpzpmi,t3_cpgedv,1565653226.0,Keep on shining OP! You look amazing and I'm glad you feel that way. Self love is hard at any size and we all deserve to feel good about ourselves in a world that runs on our lack of it. You truly have a beautiful frame! I love that bikini on you!
relationships,ewgug55,t3_cny6pb,1565390629.0,Sending you an internet hug. You did the right thing. You're a strong person and in the end your siblings will thank you. You truly love your family and it shows. I hold things get better. ❤
90DayFiance,ew8uvh3,t1_ew62mp3,1565215523.0,"Why do so many people side with Anifisa? She is beautiful but was rude, ABUSIVE, a gold digger and ABUSIVE. Jorge lied like a maniac but didnt appear physical with her in the same way. He is a VICTIM OF her. Evelyn is actually much better in my eyes. I just don't understand how people can tolerate abusers just because they are attractive."
90DayFiance,ew8uf23,t1_ew73wr6,1565215328.0,"Anifisa is an abusive POS and Jorge is a lying POS. Regardless, Jorge is a victim of HER abuse. I don't know if I think Evelyn is in the same category as her but she certainly doesn't seem overly in love with him."
Anxiety,ew2q6xg,t3_cmfdoj,1565053080.0,You should feel super proud! That's not a small deal. Anxiety is a tricky thing. I'm happy for you! :)
MachineGunKelly,ew2jm1c,t3_cmggix,1565048351.0,He just seems so nice! I feel as though he is one of the more genuine musicians out there. He definitely shares his personality more! Thanks for posting.
