as someone with BPD i know that she is probably struggling a lot internally. however, it’s never an excuse to hurt and manipulate others. and she seems to realise her behaviour is manipulative and abusive but the real issue is that she isn’t doing anything about it. people with BPD and other mental health issues CAN have healthy and functional relationships, but they must work on their problems and seek help in order to do so. i think your brother needs to realise this. he sees how much she is hurting and struggling and knows her abusive behaviour stems from this, which is why he sticks around and makes excuses for it. but her realising she’s abusive and doing nothing about it to seek help is what is the biggest red flag in my opinion—if she truly cared enough about your brother, she would seek professional help in order to get better for both of their sakes. otherwise she’s just being complacent with her behaviour, and is just using the “i feel so bad and i know i’m being abusive i’m sorry” as another manipulation tactic, and she might not even realise it’s abusive but it is.

i think the best thing you can do to help your brother is to convince him that she needs professional help, which in turn will help him realise the gravity of the situation and maybe he can convince her to do so.
there’s nothing wrong with having a mental illness or being in a relationship with someone who does, but we have a responsibility to try and get better so we can lead functional lives and not hurt the people around us. it will be difficult for him to do so, but if she never ends up trying to seek help and get better then he has the choice to either put up with her abuse and live in misery or to get out of the relationship, which he has every right to do.
sorry for going off on a long tangent, i guess i got too invested in my reply haha"

BPD,fnqmdiy,t1_fnlua3w,1587167524.0,"thank you for taking the time to respond to this, it helps me come to terms with those kinds of thoughts knowing i’m not alone. i’m sorry to hear that about your mother though :( our parents make it so hard for us to feel love for them sometimes. i hope she eases off your back and gives you the freedom you deserve. glad you were able to get some kind of escape tho. i was kind of hoping for my parents to split up some day as they don’t get along, and in that case i’d go live with my mother, but alas i still live with the two of them D: i’m 21 and have no hopes of moving out until i get married (it’s a cultural thing) so i gotta learn to live with it for now. i’m also not 100% certain yet i have bpd as i wasn’t officially diagnosed by my therapist but was told i have traits for sure."
BPD,fnf5un1,t3_g1epbc,1586901960.0,"i also want to add, i also feel like i have GAD and PAD (panic attacks have gotten much better now but at some point i was having severe panic attacks like every other day) which is why i started therapy a few months back but she never diagnosed me with any of those. i’m not sure if it’s too early for her to give me any kind of diagnosis or what (i’ve been in therapy for 4-5 months now) or if she just prefers not to give out diagnoses and just focus on treatment instead. she’s an amazing therapist but she hasn’t diagnosed me with anything since i started seeing her and i’m not sure how to feel about that. only actual diagnosis i currently have is OCD from when i was in therapy as a teenager."
BPD,fnf4zzm,t3_g160ot,1586901510.0,"wow i thought i was the only one?? my bf uses “sure” and “i see” A LOT and at first it bothered me so much and we had a few misunderstandings because of it, but right now i just got used to it because i know he means well when he says it. altho i still can’t fully get over “i see” because he sometimes uses it when he’s upset and sometimes when he’s not so it’s very hard to read and i get the wrong impression sometimes. there are also other phrases that have caused misunderstandings on my part but i can’t remember them off the top of my head atm"

BPD,feb7ljx,t3_eo371h,1578956155.0,"yes. i always end up feeling a kind of guilt afterwards, like i said or did something i really shouldn’t have, even though i was just opening up."
BPD,fdypyyb,t3_efgqu7,1578782409.0,"i do experience this at times, but i also experienced something similar as a child and it was really bad. whenever i was away from family, say, at a friend’s house, i would feel extremely guilty and feel like i’m betraying my family by not being around them and not being home. i know this is somewhat different from the original post referring to wanting to be in your comfort zone, but it really got me thinking to how i would feel irrationally guilty being away from home as a child even though the place i was at was meant to be fun. i wonder what this stems from and if anyone else has ever experienced this

i outgrew this feeling of guilt as an adult but i always wonder why i felt this as a child. could it just be regular homesickness, even though i was only away from home for a few hours? it never seemed normal to me"
BPD,fdylp4u,t3_endzsb,1578781168.0,"i recently had an issue with overdoing it with caffeine the past few years and it reached the point where i was having 2-3 cups a day. i had severe anxiety and started having panic attacks, and was experiencing really intense derealisation to the point where i suddenly couldn’t leave the house on my own. i realised caffeine was a massive culprit and quit it cold turkey. it was tough at first and the anxiety didn’t subside right away since my body was dealing with withdrawal for a few weeks, but eventually my anxiety, panic attacks, and derealisation have improved majorly ever since. i can’t say personally that it has improved my mood swings or general mood, but it definitely did help ease a lot of anxiety i was having.
dealing with the low energy at first is tough, but it gets better with time. fixing other areas in your lifestyle that may be a problem will also help! my sleep has also improved massively ever since i cut out caffeine. the cons of having caffeine really outweigh the pros (at least for someone prone to anxiety and sleep issues like me!)"
