I'm no expert, I still fall off the wagon, and I'm in my 50's (been struggling since I was 8 - ugh what a waste of energy and talent and years). But I will say, the Overeaters Anonymous approach - cutting out the likely addicting foods (they recommend no flour and sugar) - is the closest I've come so far to conquering binging. There's more to the program than just that, of course, it's a comprehensive, life-changing approach to managing addiction. But that one part, flour and sugar, helps me quite a bit. I know how they hit my reward center. It's not that different than when I smoked.

I think you‚Äôre smart to be looking for ways to make it easier to lose weight.  It will help you be successful this time.

I can share what helped me (not a healthcare professional):

Overeaters Anonymous (finding a good group) - free (they ask for a small donation per meeting if you can afford it).  Great structure to the food part - they recommend you cut out all sugar, flour, and binge triggers, period.  Eat three meals a day, no snacking.  Giving up sugar was the biggest factor, I was a real junkie.  Within a week I didn‚Äôt even miss it.  The social support is great.  Or join r/loseit - that‚Äôs a fantastic sub.  

A book I tend to recommend in addition is Bright Line Eating, which really helped me better understand food addiction and for me that made it much easier.

Tracking - My Fitness Pal is a great app.  It‚Äôs amazing how those calories add up.

Intermittent fasting - I tend to eat a nice breakfast, a big, latish lunch, and then I brush my teeth.  Done for the day.   This is a huge help to me as my binge urges tended to be in the second half of the day. YMMV.

Exercise - not a big priority at first.  Just focus on food, that‚Äôs the key weight loss piece.  Exercise is for wellness, which is great, but you can give yourself a break and not worry about it for a while.

Please be kind to yourself.  You‚Äôre taking important steps for your well being.  Wonderful."
