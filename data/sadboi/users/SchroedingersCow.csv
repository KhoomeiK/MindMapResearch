depression,fr3l8xn,t3_exo6f1,1589859878.0,"I have a 9mm I keep it my room near my bed. I find it comforting to hold and know I have a way out. I recently read that alcoholics sometimes do better with a beer in the fridge- then it makes not drinking a choice instead of a restriction. I feel like it's similar.

Tonight was one of those nights. Loading it, holding it. Knowing I have the option. I feel like I'm running out of reasons to put it away every time."

depression,fr3hzry,t3_gm8o1z,1589857819.0,"Hey - I didn't get a single acknowledgement on my bday save for immediate family. I didn't even get it on Facebook, where people say 'happy birthday' to everyone because Facebook tells them to. So, in light of that - happy birthday! I know it's dumb, sorry. 

My birthdays are some of my worst days. They're definitely supposed to be happy but they aren't for me. Just marks another year alive and another day that shows me how few people I have that care about me in the slightest."
depression,fr3hn96,t3_gm39ax,1589857612.0,"This is kinda how it works for a lot of people I think. I know for me, I wish someone would notice or care - but if someone does I go over the top convincing them that I'm fine and pushing them away, and then when they back off, I feel more depressed about it. 

Maybe I wish someone I knew would see through the 'I'm ok' stuff, and it hurts that they don't."
SuicideWatch,fqvi56l,t3_gkxy6w,1589677773.0,"I have been to Taiwan. It's a beautiful country, and I hope I can go back some day. I'm sorry you're feeling that way. Money will always come and go, but it's tough to realize you're the victim in a scam isn't it? And if it's friends who scammed you, they are not your friends. Friends don't do those things. People scam you because they are scummy people, not because you've done anything wrong - any time money is involved there is bound to be horrible people."

selfharm,fnn3fyo,t3_g2r2yo,1587083585.0,"It depends on what kind of damage is done. Assuming you didn't hit something vital or important - like a tendon, nerve, vein, artery, etc - the key is to keep it CLEAN, and keep it closed. Clean the wound well, then fashion butterfly bandages or even just use a band aids to hold it closed. Some ace bandage or self stick wrap can help if you're out and about.

There's one on the page right now where OPs dad told them to 'stop being depressed' because it embarrasses them. Much as we hope that our parents will be there they aren't always, and a lot of times that's part of the problem.

AskReddit,fk19h3k,t1_fk15xhq,1583775123.0,"I don't need the police called so they can forcibly hold me in the hospital with a bunch of medical staff who do nothing but look down on you. Look at 90% of stories of people put on psychiatric holds for similar reasons - look how they get treated, and even the verbal abuse that happens on occasion. It's always the same. There's no compassion, and no help, they hold you for the time frame and wipe their hands of you as soon as they can. All it is is an humiliating ordeal that outs you to your family and slaps you with medical bills and makes you feel worse. To be frank I'd rather just do it right and not even make it to the hospital if that's what's going to be waiting for me.

I have yet to read of anyone who was forcibly put on a psychiatric hold in a hospital and came out the other end better than when they went in. Not saying it doesn't happen, but it's clearly the minority.

And I've worked in hospitals, too. I've heard how they talk about psych holds. The disdain, the scorn. It's sickening."

AskReddit,fjz2wyv,t1_fjyhdnf,1583710147.0,"I used an online chat hotline once. I originally didn't have immediate intent to kill myself but I had a long term plan and was in the beginnings of executing it, and was in a particularly low point and tempted to say fuck the long term plan and end it. The woman I spoke with was amazing, and while I'm still off and on suicidal today, at the time (a few years back) she talked me down from immediately putting a bullet in my head and I was in an ok place for a while. When we ended the chat she asked if I could come back and talk to her the next day so she knew I was ok. I said If I was still around I would. She gave me the hours she would be working and asked that I request her specifically. 

I tried to the next day but I found out the chat line I used connected people to whichever chat line around the country was available and I didn't know which one she was at. So, for all she knows, I offed myself because I didnt show the next day. I have always felt awful about that, because for all I know she thinks I'm dead and that she should have called police or something and is blaming herself. 

That was of course before I knew who I was talking to could call the police at all. I'm very glad she didn't, but knowing that will prevent me from ever using a crisis line again. That and I don't want to make someone else listen to me bitch. 

That said. Thanks for all you do. Not an easy job, I respect you for it."

selfharm,fhzd3os,t1_fhz911x,1581996436.0,"No, but it causes the jittery feeling. Self harm and blood can easily trigger subconscious anxiety even if one isn't feeling anxious per se. I guess I don't consider my 'euphoria' state to be entirely calm and relaxed, as opposed to OP, it's more of a rush, a jittery euphoric feeling that makes my heart pound and my hands shake - but, not in a bad way, in a 'release' kind of way.
