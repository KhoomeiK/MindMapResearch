depression,fr0metb,t1_fr0kxkw,1589800643.0,"I can't do it do you not understand :( 

I'm not asking for someone to cure me I meant in like having someone who casually and normally wants to talk with me like a normal friend or family member would. I'm not asking them to literally cure my depression, I think a normal friend would probably motivate me enough to get real help. I am a pity too. :(

Also even if i do always have a choice that doesn't make it any less harder or easier to do and thats why i said I'm not strong enough.."
depression,fr0kdgj,t1_fqyz7vd,1589798735.0,"Thanks but it doesn't get better. No matter what you say. Im not gonna magically be like OOOH LIFE IS HAPPY NOW YAY I LOVE MYSELF OMG. I just am not strong enough for life, I'm not strong enough to change and my mind is just too messed up and too far gone. I'm sorry but that's just how it is. I'm not going to go to therapy and pay money to talk to someone either. That's bullshit. If people actually cared, they'd make the time to ask a simple question to me like how I'm doing. I'm not asking much, that's all I've ever wanted. I tried to fight my depression for so many years, it never fucking changes. In matter of fact, it only gets worse for me. It's hard for me to have peace and love when everyone treats me like shit. I understand therapy helps some people, but I'm not a talkative guy. I can't even talk about my darkest feelings like that. I have so many fucked up thoughts in my head. The only good thing i can do is accept depression and anxiety will eat me up and to just make it to the end of life. That's all I'm doing because I got no other choice."

He seemed to just want things to be happy. He wasn’t entirely a bad person. I guess at times he was probably a bit manipulative but I’m sure he always had a reason. He also may have seemed immature but I personally think that’s because he doesn’t know the right way to handle his emotions. Or it was because of some mental health stuff going on. His heart was always in the right place. Sometimes when you care so deeply about something it’s hard to stay 100% mature about certain things. But still I am and always was on Psycho Kid’s side because I related a lot to him. I used to deal through family problems too and I really am emotionally attached to that character. I get so mad when I see hate on Jesse. I never even read the comments because they were always being so toxic to Jesse and it broke my heart lol I liked him as a person back then and I believed it was real.

I wish it could be better for the creative people like us. I freak out in small situations too and I’m immature, lazy, weird, socially awkward. I’m all the above man. It fucking sucks. On top of that I get so depressed and anxious on somedays. To the point to where it feels crippling, like I’m trapped in a box with no way out. I worry about the future A LOT. I worry of being miserable at a dead-end job that I hate for the rest of my life, while everyone around me will treat me like shit to the point to where I feel suicidal. This is why I’m scared. I’m scared for everyone, I’m scared for myself, I’m scared for you. I’m scared of everything. I always wanted my life to be easier than this. I don’t want it to be like this. Trust me when I say, I feel your pain. It hurts, it’s like a sharp thing clawing at your heart that never fucking leaves. I’m here for you. You are NOT alone. I really hope you’ll be okay and if you can. Just try your best, and if your best isn’t enough according to society’s standards than fuck them. They don’t know your life’s story and they have no right to judge you. You are trying your best and that’s all that matters and that makes you a good person no matter what. My other advice is try to find ways to cope, if you can. I usually watch a lot of anime and VTubers to distract myself from this dark hellhole called life. There’s really no other way to solve this unless you get really lucky. So please try to find ways to cope with this. I care for you even if you’re just a stranger on the internet. I really really resonated with everything you said because I feel the exact same way dude. It’s a struggle that we can’t escape no matter how hard we try and it’s just ugh.. such a shitty situation. I feel like this world just isn’t built for people like us. We aren’t the smartest, bravest or even the strongest. But society wants that. And it’s bullshit. So I genuinely hope you try your best to forget it and have a good day. Also, to help on your situation. Try to find meditation books or videos. I think that’ll really help you. I’m actually looking into more spiritual and meditation stuff that’ll help me stay calm and become a calmer person so when I’m thrown into the shitty workforce I can somehow at least manage to keep my calm for a bit. I don’t know if it’ll work for you but hey it’s worth a shot. Alright have a good day ❤️"

And they just overall put so much pressure on students, with homework, tests. Everything. I just didn’t want to be there anymore. It didn’t make me happy at all. I couldn’t concentrate on my work at all. I always had this feeling in my heart that just made me felt miserable. I don’t know I just had a terrible high school experience. I felt like everyone I met there was fake. I felt like I was a slave to the system, having to do stuff that makes me miserable. Then I get to go home only to be overthinking and stressing about it 5 days a week and sometimes on the weekends. Everything at high school they were teaching me was useless for my future which made it even worse. And I felt like I couldn’t do anything and I felt trapped. I know a lot of people say it’s not that bad, but to me it was everything. I remember feeling sooooo fucking happy graduating. I still am, in fact I’m grateful that I’m out of there.
