If people would just sit down, concentrate on the conversation even if it's just for 15 minutes, and just say what you want to say without fear of judgement.... easier said than done I guess.

It's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy, keep that same profile and pictures up, not get any decent responses but keep it there until you get some but people won't message because it's the same profile and pics. Obviously this is discounting new users who won't have seen them before, but you only need to be around for a few months to recognise the familiar faces. 

I'm always in two minds about sending a message. On the one hand it has to be worth a go (yes, contributing to the excess message problem), but if they've been on this long what difference am I going to make? Were they too choosy? Are they serial daters? Are they just there to kill some time?"

And like men you just know they just do normal stuff most of the time and are trying to impress.

So what you then get is seemingly-active man and seemingly-active woman getting together thinking they've met that person they can fully indulge their fantasies of diving on a coral reef or camping in Ireland and trying not to give it away they're normal. It would be funny if it wasn't a bit sad."

They make for a good photo, but they simply do not represent us in any way. But it's what is expected, apparently.

Yes there are men out there who are out on a mountain or in a river more than they're at home, but they'll be out on a mountain or in a river rather than on a dating site because that's what they do.
