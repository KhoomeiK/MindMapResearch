Yea, I think it is.  Unless you are willing to reciprocate. Or its at at random chance who carries the child to term.

>Is it against my feminist ideals to be in a relationship with a man who wants two girlfriends/wives?

Only YOU can answer that.  We here are not you, and so do not know the workings of your mind.

No, I don't think you are.  What you describe strikes me as a variant of a Line Marriage from the work of Robert Heinlein.  A concept that made sense to me for the raising of children in a stable loving home even back when I was eight years old.

The '68 Beetle I had from '88 - '91 was the best damn snow car I've ever driven.  Skinny tires cut through snow, even the deep stuff.   March of 1990 we had a MAJOR blizzard in the Denver metro area.  I drove to work in the rain that night (worked graveyards) and watch the rain turn to snow, and LOTS OF IT.  Easily 12 inches of the white stuff.  I tool down the highway about 0530 doing 40 mph due to conditions, nearly white out.  As I approach the last interchange before my exit a brand new 4X4 blows past me, making it a true white out for a bit.  &#^#@^ say I.  I get past that interchange and see flashing blue & red lights, and that same brand new 4x4 wheels up in the median.  The weight of the engine over the driving wheels counts.

I miss that Bug.  My next auto purchase is gonna be one of those again.  I've had enough of computer controlled components jammed in like sardines in a can engine bays.

Personally, I believe that the universe is teaming with life.  From bacterial slime on and in rocks, to vast organisms that blot out the light from their home star.  But our kind of life, the kind that asks questions, is still rare.  Our closest living relations don't ask questions, even though they understand what a question is.  I think our branch alone on this planet has made that leap.  Perhaps we are the first in our galaxy to do so.

If that is the case, we are gonna be lonely for a LONG time.  No Vulcans, no Nibari, no Wookies to be friends with.  But it is also an opportunity for our kind.  To build great artifacts that others will ponder over for ages when they come, long after we are gone.  Rings around stars, where life thrives in jungles and plains, but there is nobody home.  Plains of stone on numerous planets, glittering as gateways to other worlds and other times.  Where we are dimly remembered as Gods, if at all."

CoronavirusColorado,fp1t71g,t3_gaomzl,1588247076.0,"Well, guess I'm your polar opposite.  I'm deeply conservative in bright blue Boulder County.  Most folks are taking this seriously, lots of masks when at the grocery.  When coworkers come on site from home they are masked and gloved for the most part, although the campus is a ghost town right now.  I have noted an increase in road traffic this week, folks out and about are about 50/50 masked/not.  

Personally when on the job site I don't mask up, I've worked with the same small group for over a year (essential worker).  I mask when I shop out of consideration of others.  I am distancing from my freind group since I do understand transmission of viral agents.  I don't mask up when I recreate outside since I rarely see folks and the surgical/cloth masks do not protect me.

I think its overblown personally, and being used by those who seek control as a fortunate event to scare folks into accepting the loss of liberty.  The numbers infected are likely MUCH higher that the official count, and I suspect it ran through my immediate family in late Dec/early Jan, the symptoms line up."
