Most important for me has been. Rest and good sleep"

 I still feel unique and special.  Bp makes me lack certain things yet I am better at other things (like empathy.. due to my lows and highs I'm able to understand and support my friends pretty well )

 I mean your right but no reason to think you lack all uniqueness due to BP, I think there's good stuff to it 

It alsow pushes one to think this due to laof self-confidence.. I mean our brains played the shit out of us .."
