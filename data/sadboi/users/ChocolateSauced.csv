That said, his father might have a better chance of getting through to him then you have had. It is simply impossible for a bipolar person to function without medication, though we all go off it at least once but usually more because when we‚Äôre well we definitely don‚Äôt think we need it and because the meds have so many horrible side effects that we feel are nearly as bad as the disease itself. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt really take getting better seriously until we‚Äôve been wounded so many times and gone through so much shit that we‚Äôre willing to do the hard work to get better. That means a lot of drama for those around us.

I think it‚Äôs completely fair for you to send him to live with his father. His father should be helping out with this, it is a huge and daunting task to deal with a bipolar person and the more hands on deck the better. If it feels like rejection to your stepson then maybe he will take it as a life-changing moment and a serious thing and maybe he will get back on the meds, and if he doesn‚Äôt, then His father can deal with the rotating door of hospitalizations that are sure to come. My family pawned me off on each other too because one person cannot deal with the load of work that a bipolar person places on the people they are living with. It is not fair to others in the family when everything revolves around the sick person and their drama. Taking turns is a good idea.

I support you in your decision not to take him with you but I hope that his biological father will be behind taking care of him because he does need someone to take care of him. He could simply end up homeless and living on the streets without care. I wish you good luck."
