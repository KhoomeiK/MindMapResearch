sphynx,fqg6970,t3_ggeuvn,1589338872.0,i use the petco paper pellet litter - the breeder recommended it and i stuck with it because it‚Äôs the least amount of dust. i tried the dust free once and it was still very dusty to me . i see a lot of other sphynx owners use dust free kind too though. good luck!

BPD,florcxv,t3_fq55wb,1585343913.0,"prozac has helped me so much in addition to dbt for my anger outbursts and obsessive tendencies - i am diagnosed bpd.  i was on zoloft for years but it eventually stopped working. i  then went to pristiq which was awful with side effects and really messed me up for months. my doctor switched me to prozac in combo with wellbutrin and i feel so much better. i don‚Äôt even need my anxiety med anymore cause the prozac overall lowers my anxiety so much. it‚Äôs one of the most trusted drugs on the market because prozac and zoloft have been studied the longest. 

everyone truly is different. start somewhere and see what works for you with help from your doctor. the efficacy of these drugs usually works across generations in a family - so if you have any family members who have tried certain meds and been successful- that‚Äôs usually where the doctor will start. good luck, let us know how you do :)"

sphynx,fi2wuzw,t3_f44lx8,1582091672.0,I used to have this issue with sphynx. Still happens sometimes but I try as much as possible to ignore it because any attention is good attention. That helped and moving the things he plays with to the living room where he tends to go and just keeping it all there. Stuff like picture frames or things I always want on a night stand or dresser I bought command strips to stick them to and he can‚Äôt knock it off - they work perfectly . Also I put 2 cat beds/caves in the room on opposite ends so if he doesn‚Äôt want to cuddle with me he has other close by choices. Hope this helps. I think as they get older and older this will adjust.
