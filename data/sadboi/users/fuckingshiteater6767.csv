imagine living your life and feeling like it’s not your life, at any second everything will fall apart. 
you can be walking down the street and get hit with a thought so bad it drags you down an instant pit of depression. you don’t know why you’re crying but you are. then it’s over and everything normal again. someone asks you what happened and you become so frustrated by your inability to explain what you’re experiencing. you feel invalid cause you can’t understand or make other people understand 

it feels like floating in a pool of nothing"
