TrueOffMyChest,fbf0xqj,t3_ecoctb,1576798735.0,"I hope today was better and thank you for your post.  I felt alone last night as well, an abysmal feeling, as if the rest of the world was this strange opaque. I was with someone at the time. :/ 

Try to hold your family and friends as close as possible, especially when it seems difficult.  Maybe reconsider calling a friend next time, suspect if reversed you'd want to hear from them. Clich√© ""this too shall pass"", well it has for me.  Family is now gone (deceased or otherwise) point is regret of not doing my utmost...sucks.

Overall you had a great 2019!  And also important let it out when it wasn't.

Make 2020 as good!

Cheers"
