Anxietyhelp,eoo0kuk,t3_bsjzun,1558726209.0,"You‚Äôre absolutely not going crazy- what‚Äôs happening here is an overload of the brain. Especially if you‚Äôre experiencing panic attacks or anything close to them. That numbed out feeling is your brain disassociating from the chaos- even on a happy vacation it was a lot to handle, I‚Äôm sure a lot to plan and manage. You have too much on your plate! I myself am going through a similar situation- I was overloaded and one day I just had such a severe panic attack that I ‚Äúblanked out‚Äù. This happened a month ago and i feel loads better, but still working on feeling more present and feeling my emotions again. Not once did i hear anything about self care- this is what‚Äôs going to save you. I would also look into talking to your doctor about these bouts of blanking out, I can‚Äôt imagine why they prescribed you Valium. But I‚Äôm not the professional, I would just think a combo of an SSRI and an as needed would help you. You should look into CBT therapy, this has pulled me out of these pits of hell before. Also TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!! take days moment by moment. Do small tasks at a time, spend time with your children doing relaxing things. Set aside time for yourself, try deep breathing techniques every day to calm your system, even look into meditations. You must remind yourself this is temporary discomfort, and not a forever thing. Hold in there!"
