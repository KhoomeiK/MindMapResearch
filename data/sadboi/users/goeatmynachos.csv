AskReddit,fq7zqfq,t3_gge8dn,1589155547.0,"Lost three kids in our school in the same year. The first was driving home one night and got into a head on collision with a big ass semi. He died immediately. The whole community was very shaken up about it. He was a popular kid, but for good reason. Was a huge loss. 

The second hits closer to home for my family, my brothers best friend commit suicide a couple weeks after the first kid died. Completely unrelated. He was also popular, and it impacted our community greatly. 

I feel because of the first two deaths, the third wasn‚Äôt properly recognized. The girl wasn‚Äôt popular but she was friends with our friend who commit suicide. A couple weeks after he died this girl took her life as well. Nobody really talked about this death. It wasn‚Äôt fair, but everyone was already mourning and it was just tragically overlooked. 

I remember the day after the first kid died the school was a wreck. Kids were allowed to leave early because almost everyone you saw was sobbing throughout the day. Even the teachers didn‚Äôt care who came to class and who left, as they knew this kid and cared for him; they were all mourning as well. It really affected everybody. It was similar with the second death, but a little different. The first kid was popular due to sports, but the second was due to the drama department. I‚Äôve been a theater kid almost my whole life and I was in class with him before he left us. It forever changed the drama classes in our school. There wasn‚Äôt a single theatre kid that wasn‚Äôt affected by his passing in some way. Just like the first however, kids either didn‚Äôt show up or went home early from grief. Like I said, the third was very sadly overlooked by most. 

Rest in peace to all three of them. They had great lives ahead of them, they all had so much potential. The communities hearts were all very broken that year. 2015 sucked a lot. It has almost been 5 years since they all left. I still think about my friend we lost every single day."

My appointment was the next morning, so I went to sleep a little earlier than normal. It was a Thursday night, and the county school district had our schools go on for an hour longer than other schools so we wouldn‚Äôt have school on Friday‚Äôs. My brother came in my room and woke me up around 10:30 ish, and I rubbed my eyes and sat up. 

I asked him what he was doing and all he said was, ‚ÄúWill died.‚Äù Will was my brother‚Äôs best friend at the time, and I had one of my classes up at the high school with him. They had a lot of funny little stories and jokes and stuff, so my brain didn‚Äôt take him seriously. I was tired, or rather grumpy and I told him to go away and let me sleep. I still remember the way he looked at me, he seemed so hurt. I saw it in his eyes. He simply walked out of the room and I started to think that dreaded thought, ‚ÄúOh my god, was he serious?‚Äù

Then my mom walked in. All I remember her saying was, ‚ÄúHoney, your brother is telling the truth. Will commit suicide a couple hours ago.‚Äù

I haven‚Äôt been the same since. I remember being in such shock that I got up and got ready for my ortho appointment, completely forgetting that it was still night time. Really fucked me up.
