KillingEve,fql7ik9,t3_gj4py9,1589448987.0,BRUH. I'm still not over from Villanelle’s heartbreaking ep THEN THIS?! He doesn’t deserve to die but he also doesn’t deserve to suffer.
lucifer,fqd4or3,t1_fqcrhlg,1589279638.0,also relatable during #SaveLucifer campaign XD
KillingEve,fq9ldoa,t3_gh9tzv,1589201483.0,for Fudge. F
KillingEve,fq9ihz6,t3_ge81uz,1589199252.0,"HOLY DUNG. my heart still racing after watching this ep. its really a roller coaster ride. im sick worried for Oksana but also worried for that family. no wait...i mean im worried what would she do to her mother. And wow. Just. Wow. The darkness. 

Also The Memorable LA~🎶 That awkward-weird Dance, her best laugh to those flat-Earth couple. Gosh! every scene!

Best episode. Best Actress, 👑Jodie. PERIODT."
KillingEve,fpurz9v,t3_gfn0xl,1588921716.0,omg thank you for this! im kinda intrigued about her radio drama
KillingEve,fprr6ug,t1_fprnxn5,1588860437.0,"i think it was Dasha first but when that woman appears in the swimming pool scene and Dasha seems scared af threatening her about not going home in Russia its now clear to me that she replaced Konstantin as V’s new handler after the Rome incident. 
Then make K focus on spying... the spy. And let The Battle of the Best Spy: Carolyn vs. Konstantin, begin 👏😂"
KillingEve,fpqtfd3,t1_fpqb1h8,1588831710.0,my bet is on Carolyn. She has a motive. That she used it to pay all the damages caused by her unauthorized operations since day one and also Hugo’s case and Eve’s (debt in canteen.? lol) [a ”huge disaster and very expensive disaster”](https://ew.com/tv/killing-eve-season-3-first-look-gemma-whelan-fiona-shaw/) as Fiona Shaw said it on interview i just found. Carolyn might also use this to flush out The twelve bcos well... she loves her job more than her personal life.
KillingEve,fpmwt7d,t3_ged0d8,1588743804.0,ask a photo for my insta
KillingEve,fpmvvxi,t3_ge8ejb,1588743142.0,Villanelle is the sweetest. thinking about having a healthy relationship for both of them makes me feel really sad. 🤧
KillingEve,fpgu4tf,t3_gdcqs8,1588609555.0,"no, it’s Neeeeko. 😂"
KillingEve,fouw3fd,t1_foualuw,1588091362.0,"i totally agree. I watched series first then reading novels bcos i also want to know them more. It got me confused too as how it became different. Made me realized that it has something to do with the tone or how did they made a different approach and digested everything so well in the series but still continue with the main idea. So i cant compare these two but understood it into the core... well i hope i really did bcos series is getting deeper and deeper... like peeling it all away, layer by layer...lol kbyeself
One thing that is now painful to think is, what V and E will be at the end. Like, damn im still rooting for them despite all manipulation and psychopathy thing especially to V. I just want them to be happy together or individually. 🤡"
KillingEve,fou996e,t1_fotz2qq,1588079337.0,"read the books, its all villaneve blessings XD"
KillingEve,fotk6pg,t1_fotjrlh,1588056467.0,It has something to do with the last mission at the theatre and how it will end... I dont wanna spoil it hahaha
KillingEve,fotfy8f,t1_fotf6g5,1588052794.0,"the theatre background. I think this will be related to the s3 finale. I noticed this hint also in season 1 Closer look videos, some Producers background was in V’s apartment... Just like the finale scene was in V’s apartment too.

Aaand it is also related on the books! 🤞"
KillingEve,foq6ded,t1_foq5y8x,1587984623.0,🤞goodluck with that dont forget your talking bear 🧸x
KillingEve,foq5qqd,t1_foq36sk,1587983982.0,i guess i have to call my amber perfume ”POWER” too and maybe run away from busses because we’ll never know what’ll happen.
KillingEve,fopz493,t3_g6ltrz,1587977097.0,this episode has everything we need. POWER.
KillingEve,fnedoo5,t3_g0srt9,1586887506.0,"i have no idea about camera works but imo as a viewer they did it on purpose to set the tone like the characters look sad or feeling down (?) and it worked for me i like it. oh well, i’ll just rewatch it too."
lucifer,flchqnm,t3_fnm279,1585031328.0,"it’s just his excuse to check on her because he’s so jealous especially Chloe looks stunning. (Look at Lucifer’s expression when she enters the bar... poor baby.)

But yeah, he’s dumb not thinking about his actions."
lucifer,fkneabo,t1_fkndamm,1584363429.0,"so true. His progress is one of the reasons I love in Lucifer. I remember face-palming almost in each every episode yet still rooting for him to be a better Devil. His decisions are scary but it’s for the best, in everytime he gave his first priority that’s how he truly care."
lucifer,fknd6ov,t1_fkmicp2,1584362519.0,"he understand human emotions but sometimes dont and also cant face his own emotions. is he like, selective understanding or he’s just that too denial? 😪 
(just my thought as rewatching for some free time. lol)"
lucifer,fdmvw88,t3_em6hcq,1578568261.0,i just sang it on my head and you’re right! finally i get it now 🤯 (I’m so dumb.)
lucifer,fb9c7bi,t1_fb7nn58,1576634813.0,"i’m hoping for Dan and Maze to be a duo as a bounty hunters. just like Maze teaching Dan to go dark to locate the cartels. (the one with fight scenes... i forgot what ep.) then Dan will be a vigilante/hero sort of at the end. he has a potential imo. After all he’d been through.

(lol cant explain my point enough...  imma rewatch XD )"
