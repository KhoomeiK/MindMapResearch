Mine is a really happy baby but still anytime she isnt smiling or is downright frowning my head goes ""oh no she hates me"" when the cause is usually shes hungry or a touch of diaper rash. As parents we are hard on ourselves. Dont let that worry you"

It took two weeks of pumping a few times a day before my body responded well. I still gotta look and think about baby to make it work and if my body really stubborn I use a heating pad on low between my breasts to trick into thinking baby is latched. These may not work but as someone with pumping issues myself these are what helped me

In the breastfeeding community they have made me understand pumping or attached to the boob directly both are breastfeeding. Shes not eating formula shes eating breastmilk. So just know your not alone. I've been told how much harder it is to pump exclusively. Because it is. Tell your husband shes still getting you immunities and how much harder it is.

I'm on month 3 of exclusively pumping and its exhausting. Pumping every three hours then sanitizing everything adds so much work. But your doing it and that means alot. Your fighting so she has breastmilk regardless. Your superwoman. Your husband sounds like he is very immature and not taking the new addition very well.

He loves his child I'm sure. But he may be trying work through the huge life change. Mind you not defending him he should be helping and not treating you like garbage. My husband took a bit to fall into fatherhood and hes amazing niw. Hut he never treated me like that. Just keep strong and remember to sleep. I learned the sleeping all the time only lasts a month"

breastfeedingsupport,fll86uy,t1_fll7aji,1585255412.0,"Is your nipple moving freely? Is the pain from rubbing against? You may need a bigger one temporarily. Me I use the regular size ones for my pump 24 mm expect when engorged I have to go up to the large size 32 mm lansoinih only has two sizes through. If you are super engorged or leaky a bigger size might bring more relief. Sometimes I only need a big size for one breast and regular for the other as well. No one warned me about these and I'm still figuring it out. Also a warm wet compress on the chest while pumping will make it easier for milk to let. Drink plenty of water. And if all else fails take a coffee mug into the shower fill with warm water dip your nipple in until a suction is created then tip back with your nipple raise this submerges you nipple in the warm wet water and helps. 

Also play with suction settings on your machine I notice sometimes I need a long harsher suction while other a simple quick rapid will work better. Like I said I'm still navigating this world but these are things I've discovered. I almost completely exclusively pump due to breastfeeding issues so if you need any tips I probably have more. One and bring a heating pad a heating pad on low in behind the breat mimics the warm of a baby and can help especially if you think and look at photos of baby"

Right now in trying to pumping at night every 4 to 5 hours and day every 3 to 4 just so I cant sleep at night. I was drinking the tea. And eating oatmeal and water intake was better. I think I'll have my husband help remind me about all that it seems to he my missing link with your saying. Only thing is if I'm tired at night I'll stop at 15 minutes whether im still getting milk or not. I fell asleep piping recently for over a hour. That when I discovered no automatic shut off to mine.
