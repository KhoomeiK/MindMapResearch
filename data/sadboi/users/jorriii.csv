postrock,f13y6hp,t1_f13c6db,1569167043.0,"shoegaze is typically characterised by making sounds you'd more likely expect from synths...but on guitar I guess. there aren't a whole lot of synths in it really, but there's no rule against it or anything. Even on 'Lovless' there is barely a synth, as those sounds are sampled guitar and vocals i believe. I guess it typically has more drum machines though and the rhythms take something from krautrock: they are often 'motorik' and drummer plays in a quite metronomical way. Can sort of see where you come from as they tend to manipulate guitars in such a way, and actually bands like MBV and Slowdive said they took more influence from electronic/rave. Hear it on 'Soon' or 'Souvlaki Space Station' its electronic dance music played on guitars to an extent, oh especially the ambient variety they took a lot from, like its ambient music made less ambient by noise guitars and fast drums behind it.

Post-rock features synths and even some of its got programmed beats i guess. More likely to have a band containing a full string quartet or brass ensemble lol."
postrock,f13xe7n,t3_d7oowb,1569166744.0,"The main difference i suppose is the structure. Shoegaze tends toward a typical pop structure and very features (if obscured) vocals. Post tends towards instrumentals with prog or classical structure.

There are things you'd find in post-rock, like would anyone mistake godspeed you black emperor for shoegaze? such as using a lot of classical 'drone' instruments. Both have some elements in slowcore as an origin too but shoegaze made it more in you face, post rock slowed it down even more!

Ultimately, where did these genres come from?

Post-rock at one point decribed a progression from typical rock arrangements, and it could be more or less anything that defied it. Maybe classed as experimental rock, or taking the spirit of prog without the wankiness plus post-punk sensibilities plus classical sense of expansive transcendant stuff without the need for the orchestra--and rejecting everything about 'rock'. Anyway, it doesn't HAVE to sound like Mogwai, or EiTS to be post-rock, but that's usually what people mean now. What about Godspeed? what about Talk Talk? Have radiohead at one point been called post-rock, because in 2000 i'm sure they were being called that a bit.

Shoegaze you could have an argument about it forever. Ultimately it was a derogatory name for bands around the THames Valley area that lacked 'charisma' compared to bands like oasis and blur, perhaps more depressing or introspective, and thus gazing at their shoes is the lack of movement or audience engagement from these bands. Some people now use it to mean 'they own a reverb pedal'. I guess it was a neo-psych, dream-pop genre that was quite variable, but it tended to feature songs that had contrasting elements: its experimental/pop. its fast/slow. its loud/relaxing. its noisy/ethereal. Or maybe it was just jangly indie guitars, i mean you can't mistake the more proto-brit-pop for post-rock easily, but in the 90s that was more likely 'shoegaze' than the term now. MBV started out doing that and more JAMC type stuff, and in fact Loveless was more like its own thing, really an experimental ungenred album.

mildlyinteresting,f0qhfq0,t3_d6573j,1568859916.0,"That's because the game of golf was actually created by using sticks to kick puffball mushrooms into nearby warrens. During the middle ages one village in Wales reportedly used a goose as its 'kicker' but various other objects depending on availability were used. The game ended when you kicked the 'chequered man' who carried many 'golfballs' on his exterior clothing such as to represent fertility, yet he only came out from his cart when all the mushrooms were successfully kicked. Modern golfballs simply imitate this folk tradition. However, unlike the puffball they are inedible. Much of this tradition remains such as the clothing being often chequered and the use of the cermonial cart. However no longer do they sacrifice newly fed rabbits out of their warrens to the god Cernunnos which is believed to have been the case after the discovery of bones nearby a neolithic barrow in the isle of skye."

Use a lot of coloured chords with sus2, maj7th and not normal harmonies. Honestly, a lot was tracked with fuzz into a marshall at excrutiating volumes, micced from a distance then compressed weirdly. its a lot to do with what happens before the pickup hears it, then layering it to overload. Other fx? Yes sometimes but not always reverse reverb. And i believe fuzz of choice is a tonebender or hm2 but he has so many!"

WeAreTheMusicMakers,eys04kj,t1_eyr64di,1567383248.0,"Generaly for conceptual experimentation, you have to pick ONE concept to base it around and really be concise with it, even minimal. Often experimenters might throw every experiment in and expect people to be able to pick out thing when they aren't drawn together. I'm guilty of it myself i am sure, that audiences, that includes the experimental audience expect just one variable to be changed, or to have just that one variable isolated from any kind of musical backing. I also know that some stuff just sounds very normal, despite getting there through odd means."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,eyrzhx0,t1_eyrchrn,1567382741.0,"

tbf a lot of experimental music is not experimentation but 'sounding like previous experimental' and doing the same things as e.g. prog rock band from the 60s, avante-garde from decades ago, expressionist composers but in fact making it more 'pop' so its listenable as 'contemporary art music'. And idk about dance genres but some of them seem screwy, stuff like 'ambient' seems specific downtempo stuff for some people and not this 20 minute stars of the lid track i am listening to which changes chord/note every 30 seconds as a maximum rate.

a lot of pop and hiphop experiments too but remains accessible, yet psych-prog-math doesn't really experiment (at least all the time, there's no more than any other genre), there are a lot of formulaic improv bands, remains inaccessible. hmm."
Psychonaut,eyot7ca,t1_eyootro,1567282899.0,"I was just going to look that one up. Its like an underlying mathematical pattern of joining nodes. The path of least resistance. But perhaps someone can explain why the galaxy filaments, since the others begin with nodes, joining the dots. The galactic filaments seem to start as evenly dispersed plasma then through small fluctuations, bigger non-uniform spots form, thing begin to coalesce to these nodes and are dragged into the filaments too. Its just that its in reverse.

The universe isn't expanding into filaments, its falling into them, i don't think its a lot to do with expansion (dark energy) but gravity (dark matter).

London certainly doesn't follow the least resistance, nor does any British road system haha.

The internet representation is more about the way they chose to graphically represent it, rather than there being actual nodes linked in that way, they are linked informationally not graphically."
WeAreTheMusicMakers,eymkjz2,t1_eymbdab,1567211763.0,"The point of any advice in the creative industry has to be highly personalised. If you are following someone else's idea it can't be that creative, and creativity is what is valued, so why are people looking for someone to tell them what to do instead of creating what to do? The secret answer would usually be something very specific to that artist that if copied would be abject failure, so i would say look inside and ignore 'proper' ways of doing it.

unless it IS a highly practical thing like how to make a website or something, even that can be creative though.

people need to give others what they want, if they are really after some heights of success and not just enjoying it for what it is, (which is something they don't know they want yet...not...spam..or risk-averse homogeneity)"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,eymk60m,t1_eylpq3j,1567211435.0,"yes and no.

""make better music."" yup no real practical advice in that, but at least it shaves off the superfluous stuff about not succeeding because some fault in networking or 'here's what you need to do...'

make better music... but making ok/bad music doesn't mean you can never make  good music...or maybe it does...or maybe it doesn't. Some focus on few songs, sure focus on perfecting them, some hone their craft by writing many so don't quit that, it just means don't necessarily push to release them, in fact doing some random songs is a kind of creative excersise that might be underrated. like a really stupid song that you put in the bin. mistakes are how you improve; but not much point sending them out as if they are your best.

or, idk, think for yourself, because i don't know you

if they could tell you what to do it wouldn't be 'valued creativity' would it, they'd be creating for you..

so in summary, just come up wih an entirely original creative way to do all of it. A record company scout won't be impressed by you thinking up the thing they thought of."

but also: if it was liked/disliked neither should let that stop him. There is a sense it is also arbitrary, just who happens across a piece of music amongst all the stuff out there and all the loud promotion is very random! so its not a very objective *judgement or criticism* but it can be a *good thing because art is about connecting with others whether its critically acclaimed or not in the end it is a personal process.*"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,eyctq8i,t1_eycb6k6,1567006750.0,"I didn't for 15 years.... well long story I was in a promising band at school that i left, and only some couple years after they are signed, so i was doing a lot of music never recorded or never completed thinking that was what i should do, but without feeling that it could ever really be part of 'a thing' due to lack of connections so didn't bother..

I think there were a couple on an unshared myspace somewhere in that but...

...upon sharing first bedroom demos gave me nothing to worry about really. One is sitting around 1.5k on soundcloud, nd its production isn't great. Some others more like 100, i feel i am still working out how to capture what's best and leave what is unnecessary- some better produced stuff is not really going over 50. never just a matter of being more 'pop' or 'well produced' its just capturing a genuine creative moment, especially in a niche genre. No real negative feedback, some feedback fro other sites that's helpful or neutral 'didnt grab me so won't put on blog'. I basically have no friends also so sharing it on facebook doesn't get reams of people, more like 2 likes and a 50% chance that's a family member. Nor do i play live; when i did i was more like the keyboard player doing all the sounds but no one thinks they are in the band \[but on guitar\].

Most importantly is actual repeated listeners though. Someone who's published making a video out of the blue not to my request or anything, or a known blogger leaving comments being impressed. Sometimes likes and things don't mean that much; no one has bought that 1.5k track yet they've liked and shared it; posts have been made on instagram to 100 likes and I look and its been played twice that day, other times the opposite. A label has offered to print vinyl but i'm waiting and seeing because i can imagine due to them being small it could just be 100 free vinyl of my own music forever lol"
WeAreTheMusicMakers,ey71dvt,t1_ey5lyhc,1566869201.0,"um, well i guess its not an invented genre, nor is ANY chord progression that unfamiliar really.

But the guy has taken that MIDI roll and performed it note for note. In fact i'm not even sure if he is playing or just put it through a different sampled piano. Just because something isn't reinventing the wheel doesn't mean its exempt from copywrite; its not a genre i really listen to but i can tell at least he's damn good at it!"
radiohead,exvp07u,t1_exurltk,1566603774.0,"Ed is more less-is-more with his role, but with about 50 pedals.

The Starcaster got reissues fairly recently which are cheap, but when Jonny Started using it was rare and vintage, no one could get them and they'd be in the 'custom shop' or vintage strat kindo of price. It seems like it was his clean stuff from kid A to HTTT he'd use that for the 'jazzy' sounds like knifes out. Yes, maybe he's not doing loads of efect in that era, he's instead doing tons of synth, ondes, string arranging, computer programs rather than use the guitar?. His tele plus, i don't actually hear great things about, its just noiseless, flat, does the job so maybe he needed more 'tone' with a semi-hollow."
