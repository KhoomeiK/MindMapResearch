And yeah I know kids can say the dumbest things sometimes  but even when i talk about things that are important to me they wouldnt take it seriously. Even now i am scared of telling my opinions to  people because i cant help but think that they will think i am dumb. (sorry if this is hard to understand English isnt my first language)

AskReddit,f4v2m4a,t3_dlvzi9,1571835420.0,"My friends told me about this a couple months ago. My friends' neighbour killed his daughter,cut her into pieces, put the body parts in the freezer and buried them to different parts of the city everyday. He continued doing this for months and he got arrested after my friend's family and other neighbours got suspicious of the smell and complained to the police. Victim's mom and sister were also in the house so there is no way they didn't knew about what was happening but still they didn't get arrested.
This doesn't count as ""unsolved"" but i still wanted to share it cuz it's pretty creepy."
