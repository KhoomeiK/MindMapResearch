ShitNeoconsSay,fr14jqs,t1_fr11l7h,1589813117.0,"that's a great question! 

the answer is that its not, at least not anymore than someone being a smoker or a drinker or a gambler or eating food that isnt kosher or being a price scalper, etc etc.

the Old Testament has some pretty stringent rules for how God's people are supposed to live. This is called 'holiness'. Christian's who live an ascetic lifestyle by abstaining from worldly things do not as an act of worship and as an expression of God's Holiness, and the Holy Spirit which is living in them.

The world is not of our faith, and our faith is not of this world, so it should be no surprise to is Christian's that we are the strange peoples and that the world do things we would never condone or partake in.

My point is that this should never have become a political issue. people --- especially Americans, living in a nation that should be called New Rome --- are gonna live a life that makes them comfortable and if having an 8 inch cock rammed inside their colon brings the heathen joy and comfort, then theres little to be done about it except to show love and compassion. 

the only time it becomes a 'problem' is when worldly people insist on desecrating the sanctity of Christian marriage by demanding the Church performs their marriages which, from some believers understanding, is considered an abomination to The Lord.


and to your point before about it being biological, so what? that doesnt make it right. that just makes it bestial. Humans have a lot of needs that are 'natural'. After enjoying heroin, an addict is going to become biologically dependent on heroin. and with no moral framework that submits to a higher power, that's all fine I guess. But if I am going to live in submission to a power that calls me toward holiness, then I am going to be forced to abstain from something's that may seem like biological needs. Christian's call this fasting, and it's common in most religions and some people fast food for weeks as a spiritual discipline.


edit: okay, I just clicked on that article.. ""stop calling it a choice. theres biological reasons for homosexual behaviour."" reads the headline.

having a biological urge or passion does not justify satisfying that urge. That should be obvious. some people have a proclivity toward anger. they dont get to cop out and say, ""that's just how I am."" Suicidal people dont get to just say, ""im going to kill myself because it's the only thing I want right now."" And some people are that way with drugs and alcohol, ""if it feels good, it is good."" or with sex. do you know that there are Sex Addicts Anonymous who have to set aside sexual desires in order to find peace and joy in their life? leftist media does everything it can to justify a pro-LGBT narrative for the sake of civil rights and social justice, but it is misleading hundreds and thousands of young people who might have homosexual tendencies but who may not find joy or peace in pursuing those tendencies and who may want to live a outside of just being ""one of those gays."""

That goes back to the problem of gender norms and toxic masculinity: more effeminate characters get excluded -- in prehistory, this might've meant death for sure, but in today's world it just means loneliness -- and being excluded amplifies their femininity.

atheism,fqzpiu9,t3_gln9oe,1589772428.0,"[heres Pete Holmes podcast with David Bazan, aka Pedro The Lion, who has a somewhat similar story as you in finding so many inconsistencies and becoming disillusioned with the faith.](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/you-made-it-weird-with-pete-holmes/david-bazan/)

[heres the pete holmes podcast episode with Rob Bell that they reference a few times.](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/nerdist-industries/you-made-it-weird-with-pete-holmes/e/rob-bell-24056647)

One way the Christian community has settled this problem of proving the existence of God is by something called [Reformed Epistemology](https://www.iep.utm.edu/ref-epis/#H2) which presents an idea that's something like, The existence of God doesnt need to be proven and can just be accepted as one of our axioms.           
Maybe its dodging the question, but some people have just decided they have accepted the faith, even though they dont fully understand why, and they want to get on with their affairs.

Finally, I think you may be interested, if you havent already, in reading some Kierkegaard. His book [Fear and Trembling](https://youtu.be/XDPSF9TGUlg) is about the Leap of Faith required to accept the religion of Christianity. Part of it is written as a dialogue between an embodiment of the religious and an embodiment of the ethical, and it tries to sort out an ethical justification for having faith or for living out a religious life. I linked a lecture I found but there are several others as well, and I even think Jordan Peterson has a lecture series on it on YouTube. 

His book The Sickness Unto Death is more for Christian audiences but it is about despair, and why we despair and how a religious life might perhaps be the solution for that despair.


So, all that said.        
I'm not interested in changing your mind using FACTS and LOGIC or even trying to change your mind at all. As a Christian, my responsibility is to display love and to share Good News when given the opportunity. Whether you recieve it or not is obviously not my responsibility, per Matthew 10:14

--------------_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Now if that's all you wanna hear, that's alright, thanks for reading this far, and good luck on your journey. But if I may carry on just a bit longer, please allow me.

I've been on a similar journey myself since last Thanksgiving. I was going through a JP lecture series and he kept talking about this ""Søren Kierkegaard"" fella, and so I decided to do my own research. I went to the library and got a copy of S.K.'s Journals and Writings.          
I fell in Love.           
I also discovered I didnt believe anything.

Everything that was taught to me growing up, maybe I said I believed it, but I determined that I had just been borrowing other people's convictions my whole life because I trusted them. I hadnt actually spent any time myself determining who I was or what I believed. And now this is becoming more Philosophical than Scientific, and I believe your case probably requires a more scientific approach. 

But after reading some of the literature and thinking about it a lot, I'm starting to come down to a conclusion that isn't ultimately final, but it is helpful. I think I gathered this piecemeal from Dawkins, Peterson, Russell Brand, and a few others along the way.          
 Whether or not God exists doesnt matter all too much this side of heaven. And perhaps what matters most to me is my level of fulfillment and satisfaction with my life. So what brings me satisfaction? Living with purpose. The feeling that my life has some meaning and direction, like I'm going somewhere. Bringing joy to others around me. Those are just some things.           
As a sinful person, I do not believe I can do those things on my own volition. Pardon the cheese, but theres a twenty øne piløts lyric that goes, 
>While you're doing fine, there's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.

So while there may not be a very good scientific appeal for religion -- I dont believe there is one, nor will there ever be revealed to be one. I think that's just a mystery of faith, as a Catholic might put it. -- there is some moral or ethical appeal to be made. I am a Christian because I need my Christian faith to live a life that brings me joy and that keeps me from doing bad things.

Call me evil, call me disgusting, call me whatever you like, I already know. I'm happy for the people who are capable without religion, but I'm not that type. 

And I know my journey isnt over yet either, but your post really grabbed my attention and I wanted to take the chance to share where I am at cause I believe we are having a similar experience. I dont know if I still believe, for real, but that's where I'm at right now. a week ago, I couldnt even tell you that much that I just shared, so..

In any case, good luck brother. I dont fault you for anything, and I wish you well on your journey. You know now that you arent alone.

UBI could replace the Fed. instead of sending money to banks, we could 'print' money by debiting it to American's bank accounts.

and UBI doesnt have to be a living wage. it could be per capita GDP, or a portion of that. it could be marked by the poverty line. it could even be just a surplus that the government makes and usually gives as a tax break to big business.

it wont make our money less valuable, as long as old money gets taken care of. it might even accelerate wealth inequality as formerly impoverished/underprivileged Americans give their newfound and sudden extra wealth to big businesses in exchange for consumer products.

I think this Covid Crisis accelerated American politics, culture, and technology by a significant factor, and set us ahead maybe 3 or 4 years in terms of how we do business and what political conversations we are having. and in some way, this stimulus is a practice run for UBI.

UBI is the Libertarian answer to Americas growing wealth disparity, and as we wake up to the reality of the technocratic oligarchy we are living in, more young Americans, conservative and leftists alike, are going to be demanding some sort of settlement from government. UBI is just the future of the nationalist conservative movement.

i regret never being able to go to college and especially not to my dream school, but I am very glad I didnt sip the kool aid back in the day.

I distinctly remember that conversation when I did my college tour at Hampden-Sydney College, which was my dream school.

I fell in love with the campus, and the community, and the job prospects. Notable alumni include Stephen Colbert and William Henry Harrison. I wanted to be a Tiger so badly, and I still regret not being a part of that. college life is a huge experience that I missed in a really significant way.

but when I finished the campus tour, I went into the finance office to talk costs.

>120k for 4 years. it was about 39k a year, if memory serves.

I looked at the finance lady with wide eyes and exclaimed, ""I could just buy a house!"" And that was that.

for me, college was a means of securing a living for myself and my future spouse. and by that, I mostly mean being able to afford a house/mortgage. 

why bother going into so much debt when the debt accrued could've just gone to the final goal anyway?

and see, higher education is great. And I regret never being able to get a degree from HSC. But higher education isn't the goal -- I do not have the privilege of pursuing a degree for my own pleasure.
