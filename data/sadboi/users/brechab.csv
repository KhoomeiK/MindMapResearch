depression,f3foj32,t3_dgukqj,1570900212.0,"Totally agree. Found this quote the other day that is a good reminder of that BS ...

“If you look at the fact that you have a roof over your head, food to eat, that you are young and beautiful, and live in a peaceful land, then no; you have nothing to be sad about. But the fact is, we are not just a physical body. We have souls too, and sometimes our souls get sick. If you break a leg you don’t say “I shouldn’t have a broken leg” and ignore it; you seek help. It’s the same when your soul gets hurt.” - a doctor’s reply when the patient said she had nothing to be sad about."
Fibromyalgia,f3fnufn,t1_f3fk2nm,1570899900.0,"Thanks. I wondered if the dose may be too high. I’m small too, and usually am quite sensitive to meds as it is. I will cut it in half to see if it helps. 

When you stopped - was it cold turkey or slow tapering off?? My doc told me I could just stop taking it but didn’t really go into detail as to how, as I told her I’d try it for 4 weeks at least. But man, that sounds unbearable now."
Fibromyalgia,f3fnn9v,t1_f3fdiiz,1570899809.0,"When you went off it ... did you stop cold turkey? My doc told me I could “just stop taking it” but I’m very anxious about withdrawal symptoms. My life is at an all time high regarding stress, and I really don’t need any more of it."

Fibromyalgia,f3fncbu,t1_f3fc0cc,1570899667.0,"Yes .. I’ve tried all the OTC relaxers, Gabapentin, Diclofenac and Cyclobenzaprine. None really helped. Diclofenac a bit maybe, but it’s sooo hard on my guts. Have you found any that work? 

I take magnesium, Tumeric, Vitamin D and B12 every day. 

My stress level has been through the roof for the past year, and at its worse the last four months. LONG story that I won’t get into, but obviously it makes everything worse. 

I’m just at such a loss.  I’m so sick of trying meds only to have no relief, just shit side effects and then horrible withdrawal. Thanks for answering."

A couple cups of coffee has helped me function, although I never drink it so I think it’s extra effective since I have such a low caffeine tolerance now. I’ve also had nightmares every night, so that sucks. But it is helping me stay asleep. Again only four days so Im sorry I can’t be more helpful. I hope it works well for your SO!!!"

I just couldn’t handle the fact that I wanted to die yet I was in the most majestic place I’d ever seen. I hate that depression steals our joy and those moments ...

Then I just use pre chopped olives, red onion (chop in food processor - soooo easy and no tears!!) and avocado for some yummy fat!! Then just a simple balsamic and olive oil dressing.

Bamboo forest (Pipiwai Trail), and make sure you hike a bit at Haleakala!!

It’s really hard to train the brain “back” after so much trauma. It could also be the unexpected (23 yo) death of a family member - to which legal issues lasted a few years after that. It was fucking hell, and at around the same time I started working as a medic seeing death/trauma every day. I just tried to help everyone else through the trauma  so I never dealt with how I was feeling and I think all that shit built up eventually led to the pain flare I’ve been having for four years."

And it’s YOUR health, not theirs. So best to find someone you can be open with, otherwise you will find that you leave stuff out. Trust me, my doc went away for a year and her replacement was terrible. I would’ve left if my original doc was not coming back. 

You can also ask to be referred to a specialist - rheumatologist, neurologist etc for further testing and opinions. GPs have soooo much they deal with, we can’t expect them to know everything about every illness. So go to the ones who know about Fibro. Best of luck to you, I know it’s tough!!"

Fibromyalgia,evuob1x,t3_cfya0z,1564801019.0,"If you try something, you have to stick with it. My rheumatologist also denied diet changes, but only because they take so long to show any evidence of progress. Soooo I don’t think they truly believe diets don’t have an impact, rather they understand that for people with Fibro it’s a really tough go - diets are hard enough, let alone with our symptoms!! 

On that note, I tried the AIP diet for 12 days and my symptoms were better by far ... except I caved and ate a bunch of ice cream, McDonald’s and pizza on the 13th day because I was going bonkers. Lol. So just stick with it if you try! Even at reduced symptoms I was going mad, so it’s all in the mind. Therapy and diet changes should always happen simultaneously lol."

I had one but right when I started seeking treatment she left for over a year for training. I’m seeing her on the 22nd and hoping she’ll be able to help or at least be NICE. The doc that replaced her was sooo mean and just awful in every way. 

I’ve tried everything, well that’s how it feels. But lately I just stick to heat, stretching, meditation and exercise if I am able to. I also started a new diet - previously a vegetarian but now trying AIP for the past few days. No difference but I also cheated today and had four buttery Ritz crackers lol!! Also it’s only been 4 days!! 

I’m going to start trying Tai Chi as I’ve been reading it’s very helpful. I guess I’m just sick of trying things and them not working ... Just one of those days where I feel hopeless. The lack of sleep doesn’t help with my negative mood! I’m hoping to get some motivation back to keep trying."

Fibromyalgia,etltv17,t1_etlq2uk,1562945192.0,Haha!!!! Dogs are the best no matter what!
Fibromyalgia,etlm1kl,t3_cc6bvp,1562940009.0,"Oh gosh, I’m so sorry! I hope you are okay and feel better soon. Is there any way you can get into your doctor and get the accommodations you need at work?"
Fibromyalgia,etllsdg,t3_ccb512,1562939826.0,"YES!!! I was just going to post something similar. It’s so good to know that other people get it and don’t mind if you vent about how crummy this condition is. I hope you get some good sleep soon! 

Thanks everyone for being so great on here!"
Fibromyalgia,etlljp6,t1_etkjsw6,1562939656.0,CBT is a great tool. I always tell my therapist I know what to do I just can’t do it/my brain won’t believe it. So hopefully with practice and time those negative thoughts will be less and less. Thanks again! :)
Fibromyalgia,etk7ptl,t1_etk5i4v,1562891069.0,This made me LOL!!! You go Glen CoCo!
Fibromyalgia,etk77za,t1_etk5cvl,1562890693.0,"The thing is they HAVE! They are always willing to help and any time I’ve talked to them about my issues they always ask what they can do... I sometimes feel guilty asking for help even though they’ve offered. My silly brain! I should focus on what a huge blessing they are in my life and just suck it up and ask. 

I have a therapist and she’s great too but we haven’t touched much on the chronic part of Fibro, just the pain. Thank you! I will bring it up next session."
Fibromyalgia,etk0s37,t1_etju8ue,1562886036.0,"Thank you, it’s so good to know I’m not alone! You are right - just have to do what’s best for me even if I’m worried it will make others uncomfortable. I wish you luck when you live with them!"
Fibromyalgia,etju445,t1_etj5x0m,1562881525.0,Thank you for your kind words! This is all very new to me... I’m definitely way too hard on myself and have been cursed with perfectionism. I would never call anyone with a Fibro flare lazy but then I do it to myself?!?! Doesn’t make any sense! Thanks for reminding me it’s important to rest on the bad days.
