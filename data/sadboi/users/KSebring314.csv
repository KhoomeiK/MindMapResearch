depression,fpbzifx,t1_fpbygh1,1588482949.0,"Well when she's mad and saying this, there's not really way to calmly talk to her, and when she isn't talking about it, well, it just doesn't make sense to talk about bc it's almost like talking to a different person. Also, with schoolwork, I am (not to brag) really smart, just I find school so fucking boring bc I don't learn anything, and if I do start my own business it's not going to matter that much anyway, and I get that I will almost definitely have to get other jobs if I ever want to have money for my business to grow with in the beginning, but idk it just feels so boring and irrelevant, especially when I do amazing on the actual tests like azmerit (in my state, it's not the same everywhere, but it's basically like SATs but for middle and elementary school), so I mean idk it's just all annoying, especially since I don't really plan to go to college or anything because firstly my family is poor so I would need a scholarship as I don't want student loans, and also I mean why go to college for tech stuff if the qualification is just a test that you can take at home (legit that's actually how it's intended to be done, I'm not even talking about one of those fake diplomas or anything), and again I'm starting my own company so I'm not looking for getting like a huge job working for Google or something if I'm just getting a job so I can feed myself and all that and then have money left over to invest into my own business. My mom does sometimes say that she supports me, but I can tell that she thinks it's just one of my childish ideas that will never take off, and it kinda pissed me off how she thinks that, because it seems like she hasn't noticed the fact that I have been getting some customers, and ive invested a couple hundred dollars of my own money that I worked for into it, not to mention countless hours trying to get the word out and make my website, and do work for customers. Sorry, I notice that I'm really rambling and that this is a long response, but I tend to do that a lot."

teenagers,fp87cdc,t1_fp86l4y,1588385363.0,"Well the thing is, she pays for a lot of our food, which isn't really a cost that is constant so idk how you would figure out that, and what you are thinking of is probably child support, but the thing is is that she also supports my dad. Also she does all the shopping and a lot of the cooking, which my dad and I don't always have time to do, and my dad normally can't go shopping bc he has had surgery on his foot, and it was done wrong or something, so it hurts him a lot, and so it's pretty fucked the situation we would be in without her."
teenagers,fp86g52,t1_fp864ph,1588384730.0,"Yeah, but she could make the case that she is doing it as punishment, but of course I could make the case that it's not even close to fitting, especially since I had already listened to her and done what she said when she started hitting me, and also I could make the case that I'm worried about what it could turn into in the future, so yeah it's probably illegal, but still I mean then I'm back to thinking about if I really want to call the cops because it could fuck us all over financially so any way you slice it, I'm fucked."
teenagers,fp862u7,t1_fp85y7j,1588384463.0,"Yeah I've tried it, it doesn't work. I've even tried threatening to call the cops, but up until now when she punched me, she's not done anything illegal, and I'm honestly not sure this is illegal."
teenagers,fp85uhp,t1_fp85pux,1588384295.0,"Yeah maybe, just I think I could get in trouble for running away even if I just do it to give her a scare, plus she would probably try to punish me and take away all my stuff for a long time if I did do that.

teenagers,fp85okz,t1_fp857wv,1588384174.0,"Idk tho, the legal system is pretty fucked, and my mom actually is legally able to slap me around as punishment, just I think punching me as hard as possible in the chest is where it becomes illegal, but she's only done it once so idk."
teenagers,fp85k09,t1_fp85e7f,1588384079.0,"Well I could run away, but I don't know if my friends parents would be ok with it, especially since most of them know my parents, and I'm pretty sure you can get in trouble if you are keeping a kid at your house who ran away, even if the kid is ok with it. Plus, I don't think it's that serious yet that I should run away."
teenagers,fp85ezu,t1_fp7us9h,1588383976.0,"Well see the thing is, it wouldn't exactly be just ""going without some stuff.""

I'm pretty good with computers, so I could hack her and everything, but my family shares one good computer so I can't like erase the drives or anything, and she would go ballistic if she ever finds out I hacked her Facebook account or anything, and I mean plus that's kinda illegal to do. Also, I mean like texting her friends or something, I mean that could also get traced back to me, and I mean it doesn't really seem fitting because i mean for one thing it's not true, and also, she didn't blackmail me so yeah."

teenagers,fp7r09b,t1_fp7qhqi,1588375998.0,"Yeah, but I can get in trouble if I hit her or anything. What I think I'm going to do is this: next time she goes ballistic, I'm going to call CPS or someone, and say that my mom has been gradually getting more and more violent, and I am worried that I could be in danger, and want to prevent getting seriously injured before it happens, and none of that is a lie. What will probably happen is that she may be taken away for a while and see that she needs to calm the fuck down and stop doing this."
teenagers,fp7qbgj,t1_fp7pa82,1588375597.0,"I know it doesn't make it ok, just I'm really trying to weigh my options, because right now, I'm not in serious danger of going to the hospital because of my mom, and if I call CPS on her, and she goes to jail, or there is a restraining order on her against me, there's not really that much of a ""fuck go back button"" on that move."

So then why give this ""advice"" if you don't believe it. Also, it seems like you didn't read the whole post judging by that, so perhaps you should read it and then you might believe it."
teenagers,fp7if7l,t1_fp6mz9z,1588371212.0,"Yeah, but I don't know what sub to post this on. I mean I would post on entitled parents, but most people just go to that sub if they want a good laugh, which I don't understand, but I feel like somehow I would get better answers here. I guess what I'm looking for is someone who might be able to tell me what my next option should be from a legal standpoint, but I don't think there's an r/askalaywerwhatishoulddoifmyparentshitme subreddit."
teenagers,fp791b8,t1_fp781ff,1588366237.0,"I've tried reasoning, and it doesn't work. See the thing is, that this doesn't really count as child abuse legally I don't think, because I (not to brag) am kinda strong so I don't get hurt very easily and she hasn't really screwed me up yet, and I could probably fight her off if she did actually try to fuck me up unless she had a weapon, and she doesn't do this like every day, or even every week, but it still happens like every other month, maybe less often, but yeah idk. Also after it happens, as long as I don't do something like go to my room and lock myself in, she will normally be right back to normal like 20 minutes later, and possibly even joking and happy, so it's really hard to actually do anything, because the CPS would come and they just see some happy mom and well yeah, and if I do make her more mad, then she will take away my phone, and I can't call CPS."
teenagers,fp78906,t1_fp760k5,1588365839.0,"I know martial arts pretty well, as my dad is a 4th degree black belt in traditional karate, and learned taekwondo from a person who trained the north Korean army, and I learned from him, so from a young age I've know martial arts and I'm pretty strong, so normally unless it's really unexpected I can block her hits, and I'm strong enough that she's never done anything that has seriously injured me, but I can tell that she put as much force as possible into that punch this morning, just luckily she doesn't know how to properly throw a punch, so it didn't hurt as bad as it could've. Also, I'm 14, and I'm trying to start a business doing tech support which I'm really good at , and I often work for my parents businesses and make money, but besides that I can't drive so my job options are limited. Also, the thing is that my mom has taken me down to juvy a couple times to have the officers tell me where I could end up if I continue down the path that I'm on (my mom took me down there after I refused to hand over my phone because I thought that taking it away wasn't fitting because what I did was really small) and I could tell that the officers were like ""really? You think he's ever gonna go to jail? lol"" but they still told me stuff and actually said I'm a good kid, but what I found out is that my mom actually can hit me around and everything, as long as I'm not like injured or something, and I also learned that until I'm over 18, or until I am over 16 and the court has deemed that I am an adult or something if I make an appeal and I am deemed self sufficient and I have a steady income, I literally can't own anything."
teenagers,fp76euj,t1_fp75r1x,1588364896.0,"My dad has tried to talk with her, but she just doesn't listen to anybody who tells her that she's wrong. Once my parents went to a marriage counselor, and my mom liked the counselor because he agreed with her, but once he started saying that she's in the wrong, they stopped going to him, and I'll give you one guess why. Also, what's bothering her is that she likely has anger issues, and she hasn't gotten properly diagnosed or anything, but if you saw how mad she gets, and what she gets mad over, you would know what I mean. She just doesn't know how to control her temper, and there is practically no way to deal with her. She probably means well, but just gets do mad that she doesn't know how to actually get someone to do what she wants, and just loses sight of her goal and goes ballistic on them."
teenagers,fp75nux,t1_fp75iuy,1588364506.0,"Well, like I said, we would get fucked if she did go to jail, because my family is poor and my dad is old and has had way too many surgeries."
teenagers,fp75gey,t1_fp75b6e,1588364397.0,"Yeah, but there's nothing that can legally get her in trouble on it, especially since she doesn't follow through with any of her threats in it. Sure what she does in it is morally wrong, but not legally. America's legal systems are fucked."

Plus audio doesn't do too much. Also I have talked to my dad about it, and he doesn't like my mom either really, but he also needs her cuz he can't support himself, and I'm not 16 yet so I can't drive and get a good job or anything yet"
