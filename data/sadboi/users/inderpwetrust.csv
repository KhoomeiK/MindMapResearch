Mariners,fm6c0w2,t3_ft1l8f,1585790741.0,"TL;DR:
I'm a fan of the Mariners because it was the team I grew up watching, and gave me good memories over the years.
***

Some of my best memories are sitting at the kitchen table with my mom playing card games while listening to the radio with Dave Niehaus and Ron Fairly/Rick Rizzs blasting through the house. Before we had to wait until FOX (I think) deemed them worthy to broadcast because they were playing the Yankees or something. Then Root Sports started and we all sat in the living room ignoring each other.

My dad, back in the 70s & 80s was in the radio business and would occasionally be gifted box seat tickets. Sometimes we'd be the only ones sitting in the whole row but it was still awesome.

Once the 90s rolled around, I was working for a restaurant in SODO and had a customer who would give me his season tickets to games he couldn't attend. First base side, four rows back. I went to a lot of games through the 90s. Still have most of my ticket stubs from then as well."

Anxiety,fkfj5tf,t3_eupik4,1584135566.0,"I've been doing my best to stay level headed through what's been happening. I'm in Seattle, so it's been a bit tough here always hearing my hometown/state mentioned on the national news, which I try to not have on too long but I like to stay informed, and of course it's always DOOM AND GLOOM.

Since they shut down schools here (until April -24th-!), I'm going to have to come up with so many things to keep my 8yo from playing Minecraft and hilariously enough, Plague Inc all day which will be quite the exercise. There are no indoor activity areas open in the city as far as I know, at least within walking/public transportation distance as I don't drive due to anxiety.

I agreed to help a friend watch their son (mine and theirs are BFFs) while they work as I am a SAHP. Today I had a small absence seizure (one where I just kind of space out instead of falling over, etc), which then of course caused me to have a bit of an anxiety attack after. Whee.

This is only day 2 of schools (and most of the city) shut down. Just the thought of living with this extra stress as well as being concerned about my elderly parents, not able to see my therapist in person has me a bit shaky. My therapist has offered online sessions, but I dunno if I would feel comfortable doing that with a kid and husband WFH as we have a very small house.

Hopefully it's just the sudden shock of having all of this happen so quickly that's getting to me. I will do my best to stay strong, for the whole household and for my own self!

The storyline -is- structured different from the other seasons as it only has 10 episodes to tell it. They can't make each episode just crime solving, and Chloe had a lot to do with the the way it went, along with Lucifer and Eve (who I didn't fully enjoy, but that's a different issue). The wit is still there, just in a different way than what we're all used to.

But who knows maybe I dunno what the hell I'm talking about. S4 wasn't a full disappointment but it was a bit jarring after what I'm used to. Even considering Lucifer's ass in full view.

I've become used to DC completely losing the feel of characters on TV series or movies. The writing on Lucifer (and for some of the CW series) is good enough to overlook that as well as Tom Ellis' acting. This is coming from a comic snob.

The Lucifer made for TV might fit in to the Sandman TV series depending on how they portray that universe. There are only one or two -major- similarities between the comic version of Lucifer and TV version, ie living in LA and owning a bar, and the character Mazikeen. I'm thinking you're aware of all this since you made the comment above. I'm only trying to make it understandable for someone who may not know and can follow my broken explanations.

Merging the two characters with their familiar but separate backstories may not be too difficult. But that may be just my overly hopeful opinion.
