relationship_advice,fqx6h6r,t3_gl46mj,1589726869.0,"As someone who has diagnosed OCD which I’ve been dealing with for the majority of my life, I think that if you want your relationship to work then the OCD needs to be addressed. She needs to put the work in to get better through cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure-response therapy. But I should clarify that she needs to do this for herself first and foremost, which will end up resulting in an improvement in your relationship when she becomes more comfortable with intimacy. 

OCD is a debilitating mental illness and it is affecting her ability to live a normal life. Without putting in the effort to improve her mental health via the therapy techniques mentioned above, the problem in your relationship will not improve."
infj,fqtftsg,t3_gkr1fw,1589638146.0,"Therapy in general but especially exposure-response therapy (look it up if you’re not already familiar—it’s used to treat anxiety and OCD too). Stop yourself from reacting to insecure thoughts and impulses. It takes a lot of strength, it’s emotionally difficult, and you will fail sometimes, but it’s worth it.

And stay out of relationships with avoidant people!! It just doesn’t work if you have an insecure attachment."

WomensHealth,fqplswc,t3_gk7z3d,1589549343.0,"I’ve been to one gastroenterologist for frequent diarrhea and gas. The first appointment was just a consultation and she asked me lots of questions about my body’s digestive behaviours and when these issues began. 

She said that IBS was a “diagnosis of elimination” meaning that if she found no other cause of these problems, then it must be IBS. We scheduled a colonoscopy which came back normal so she treated me for IBS by putting me on a low-FODMAP diet which made a huge difference. And that’s now how I live my life!

It sounds like you’re having regular bowel movements and that your issues are related to gas and discomfort. I don’t know if that alone will qualify for an exam but the doctor will ask you the right questions to figure out what needs to be done. I doubt there would be any kind of exam on your first appointment. 

Hope this helps!"

In recent years, I had one crappy psychologist and one amazing psychologist. The person definitely matters. I spoke to both of them about the same issues. The first one drew no conclusions from what I shared. The next one was able to identify that there was trauma I hadn’t processed. Once she figured that out and helped me work through it, it was honestly life changing. But I worked at it and did my homework. 

In both cases I went once per week until I felt comfortable going less often, like every two weeks or once a month. 

I think a bit part of it for me was sharing personal details and feelings in an environment that was safe and not judgemental. I have great friends for that but speaking with a therapist is just different. I felt like I could say anything and be understood.

This was back when digital cameras were the thing and mine started malfunctioning. I uploaded the pics to my computer but I couldn’t delete the photos from my camera! Needing my dad’s help, I had to find a way to give him the camera without him seeing my naughty pics. 

When you turn on the camera and open the photo library, it will display the photo that you had last selected when the camera was last on. Knowing this, I went through the library to a random, non-sexy photo and turned off the camera. 

I went to my dad and asked if he could help me with my camera. We stood side by side, looking down at the camera as he powered it up. The library opened and there were my teenaged boobies in my black lace getup, posing seductively. 

I panicked and blurred out “click to the left!” to get him out of the group of sexy pics. “NO, THE OTHER WAY!!” I yelled as he accidentally clicked to the right instead, going through multiple sexy poses until his panicked fingers clicked away those pictures.

Try also using toys or aids, like putting a pillow under your bum in missionary, or under your pelvis if you’re laying on your stomach, to get more g-spot stimulation. 

Try using a bullet vibrator on your clit during penetration or have your partner stimulate your clit with his fingers. I find the vibrator to feel better overall and that it kind of “activates” my G-spot.

Last but certainly not least, a lot of foreplay before sex is SO important to me because it gets me turned on and wet. Having an orgasm before sex makes the sex feel 10x better than without it.

AskWomen,fih1ub3,t3_f7ulk5,1582405574.0,"It’s a small but powerful example. I had been very stressed in general for a couple of weeks and my anxiety was through the roof. One day I came home to dimmed lights, a bubble bath, flower pedals, wine, candles, and spa sounds. My boyfriend had set everything up while I was walking the dog. He had an appointment to go attend and left me to relax. I stayed in there for over an hour and it made SUCH a difference. 

When he came home we ordered food and relaxed. The whole thing made me feel heard, understood, and cared for.

Anytime I’m stressed or going through a tough time, he goes out of his way to make me feel special."
AskWomen,fib1i2b,t3_f796fa,1582312694.0,"I have two! Also, I’m sorry to hear you’re going through something. You WILL come out stronger! 

1) I broke up with my boyfriend of 5 years. It was a tough relationship but it felt like my entire world had changed. It was extremely difficult but it was the largest growth period that I’ve experienced to date (I was 23 at the time). I didn’t even talk to guys until 6 months later and it was a special time for self-discovery and doing the things I loved - especially things that weren’t as easy to do in my relationship. 

2) My boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me and it crushed me. I knew things weren’t perfect but I wasn’t ready to be alone. It was very painful to lose my best friend and to face things about myself that I didn’t like (things that caused issues in our relationship). But weeks later, I met the love of my life. I was ecstatic that my ex had dumped me because he pushed me into the arms of this incredible man who loved me for exactly who I am. Now we live together and are going on two years. 

You can do this!!"
AskWomen,fib0vnf,t3_f7cbra,1582312334.0,No way! I think I’m okay financially and would have lots of help with caring for the baby from my partner and our families. But I’m not mentally ready to be a mother and give the child all of the love and support that it needs.
AskWomen,fiax7sc,t1_fiawlrb,1582310186.0,I’ve been going to a pro for 4 years but I REALLY want to cut this expense. I love my Brazilians but it’s very expensive!

AskReddit,fi7isqq,t3_f6wj4a,1582222195.0,"As a woman with lots of women as friends, I can confirm that a need for an emotional connection first is not consistent across women. And some of my guy friends have expressed wanting some kind of connection before sex. 

However, for those who do, I think it’s because it helps build a stronger attraction. Also it’s pretty easy for some to find sexual partners so it can be a way of heightening standards instead of sleeping with someone just because you can."

AskReddit,fhj8toi,t3_f3j82x,1581640365.0,"I’m very introverted and get anxious in social situations but worked as a restaurant server for many years. I had a “customer-facing” persona that was essentially a more outgoing and chatty version of myself. I just played that part in the workplace. 

It’s tiring but it works!"

AskReddit,fhj7pb3,t3_f3jayz,1581639654.0,"Right after finishing grad school, my former TA emailed me (and a big group from my cohort) about an opportunity to help out with a conference that his employer was running. I really didn’t want to, so I ignored it completely. 

Two days later, I somehow bumped into him on the street and he brought it up to my face. So I thought, “well now I HAVE to do it,” because I had no excuse and was too shy to say no to his face. So, even though I really didn’t want to, I ended up volunteering. 

I built a great relationship with the organizers and they ended up introducing me to a client of theirs who was looking to hire an executive assistant. They recommended me for it and I got the job. Four years later, I’m a VP at that company and love my job. 

Sometimes I think about how crazy it is that this happened from a random encounter with my TA."
AskReddit,fhj4xw3,t3_f3jbze,1581638222.0,"It’s important!!!! I have dry skin. My morning/night routine is oil cleanser, vitamin C serum, spf moisturizer. If I’m extra dry, I use a beneath the surface moisturizer. 

Once per week I use a lactic acid exfoliant at night instead of the vitamin C serum. 

I had seriously, noticeably gloat skin after a couple months of this. 

My favourite brand for skin care is the Abnormal Beauty Company. It’s very affordable and actually WORKS."
