I didn’t have an opinion on Taylor until she did something shady to my friend. Like Taylor, my friend is a therapist (albeit older and more experienced). She asked Taylor in an Instagram comment how she sets boundaries with patients while she’s in the public eye. Taylor screenshot the comment and posted it to her story with my friend’s username (just like Kaitlyn did to a fan recently) and attacked my friend. 

I personally called Taylor out for posting my friend’s username, knowing that her fans would attack my friend. She denied any wrongdoing and I called bullshit - if she doesn’t know how social media works she shouldn’t be an influencer.

Then she went on this long-ass rant on her stories and never apologized. Meanwhile, it has been almost a year and my friend is STILL getting DMs and hate comments from Taylor stans."

I’m a white woman living in the South and I’m just horrified by the way people speak about race, sexuality, gender identity, and world issues like diplomacy, climate change, and violence. 

I don’t speak out against it because I want a gold star next to my name. I do it because I want the world to be a better place for everyone, not just people who look, love, and live like I do. Most of the discussion I see on here seems to come from this intent.

Ellen enjoys the privilege of socioeconomic capital and social capital, which is why she is even given access to political figures in the first place. If I were her, I’d be kind but I’d also have a frank conversation if he was willing to engage in one.

The bottom line is that the “we have to be nice and the world is full of smiles and butterflies” way of thinking is bullshit. Go look up GWB’s record on Gay Rights.
