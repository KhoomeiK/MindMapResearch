AmItheAsshole,fp0skaq,t1_fp0omtf,1588215974.0,"The whole point of having a conversation is to exchange ideas- exactly what we’re doing here. In order to do this effectively, it’s important for participants to be considerate of one another. Using words that you know the other person will likely not understand makes for ineffective communication. Not only that, but the fact that you expect people to take the time to look up words (that a small percent of the population would know) in order to continue having the privilege of listening to your ideas...is just really vain and off-putting behaviour. 

If you want the world to know you’re a logophile you could start a “Word of the Day” on a social media platform or something similar. Heck, you can find people who share your passion and express interest in wanting to learn new words! You can share your passion with others- but you WILL rub people the wrong way if you purposely make it difficult for them to understand you."

AmItheAsshole,fp0o3kz,t3_gakemi,1588213227.0,"NTA. What she did was wrong and you were right to call her out for it. I’m shocked to see all the “mind your business” replies but this perhaps explains why the world is such a shithole. If we all just look the other way when someone does something undeniably wrong, how are we all not assholes here? Someone’s livelihood depends (maybe in part or full) on the sale of their products through Amazon. And during a pandemic...your friend chooses to take their product for free. That’s incredibly wrong. Good for you OP for pointing that out to her and reconsidering the friendship."
AmItheAsshole,fp0kg1n,t3_galiw5,1588211059.0,"YTA if you know it’s likely that the other person won’t understand what you’re saying. It’s like if I started speaking French to someone who only speaks English and just shrug and say, “I LOVE speaking French. Sorry you don’t appreciate other languages like I do teehee.” It’s not an effective way to communicate. It’s also inconsiderate."
ptsd,fokmz6f,t3_g7qupp,1587845099.0,"I don’t normally tell people I have PTSD. Occasionally I’ll see a new doctor or pharmacist and they’ll ask about medications and what I take them for and it inevitably comes up (they don’t ask further once I say PTSD, it’s just that many of the medications I’m on or have been on have different off-label uses). Telling people I have PTSD but don’t want to talk about it will just result in them filling in the blanks on their own- and you’re right OP ...people can be horribly judgemental. The alternative of actually delving into the horrific things I’ve experienced will really change the way people see me. Even if they aren’t likely to gossip.   I’m worried about flashbacks happening around people as well. I don’t have many close friends anymore because of this.

Your feelings are valid- I wish people were less ignorant about mental health in general. I would love it if appropriate, considerate responses were more of a social norm."

changemyview,fjq3vux,t1_fjpyr44,1583566983.0,"Regulating weed is different than regulating sex. The “product” has to meet strict standards before it’s sold to customers. Customers also don’t endanger the health of weed lol.

There are a ton of serious health risks (including the physical, mental, and emotional health of the person whose consent is just a commodity). It is the governments job to protect its citizens- risks should be minimal."
changemyview,fjpytrs,t1_fjprq1l,1583563563.0,"It’s not a risk if that’s literally the point of going to a nightclub. It’s pretty much guaranteed.

If you’ve got an example where there is a risk of harm that is caused without the consent of client...I think it would be a tad more appropriate."
changemyview,fjpr70r,t1_fjpqo3a,1583558895.0,"Your example is about employees choosing to endanger their own health instead of wearing earplugs. Mine is about someone causing harm to another person.

I expect loud music when I go to a nightclub. Should people expect STIs from sex workers?

Edit: So people [do sue clubs](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/nyregion/ex-hostess-at-lavo-sues-claiming-loud-music-damaged-her-hearing.html) for loud music."

Many jobs are dangerous, yes, but the chances of infection are incredibly high in this case and aside from condoms- what measures could really protect these workers from contracting an illness that could lower their overall quality of life?"
changemyview,fjpp1rg,t1_fjpi4hu,1583556965.0,"This is why I linked to the article that contained studies showing that rates of STIs are much higher among sex workers.

And most health tests require a waiting period....I used HIV as an example."
changemyview,fjph17g,t1_fjpf68o,1583550586.0,"Wouldn’t it be a problem in a litigious country like America? You pay for a legal/regulated service and then you get a disease. You don’t think people would sue?

There are a ton of papers cited in [this](https://www.iqsolutions.com/section/ideas/sex-workers-and-stis-ignored-epidemic) article. Some of the statements regarding STIs are staggering. Like, “Alarmingly, studies have shown that only 47% of female prostitutes are aware of their HIV status, less than 50% of these women had a health screening in the previous year, and on average had 17 sex partners per week.”

Remember, HIV doesn’t show up immediately after exposure. Newer testing (virus detection) still requires a window period of 1 month and if the antibody test is used, it could take up to three months for those tests to show accurate results. Some people are going to get infected."

Do you also ask people to do things for you in exchange for exposure?"

relationships,exwqpdr,t3_cuoirk,1566623387.0,You lied about “non-platonically” texting another girl? Uhh your girlfriend may be unstable and horrible to you but you should sort that out before you go looking for another relationship. That’s incredibly disrespectful and lying is not going to help the situation. If you feel the need to lie to her you probably shouldn’t be with her. I’m not saying you deserve the abuse or anything- it just seems like you’re already checked out of this relationship.
