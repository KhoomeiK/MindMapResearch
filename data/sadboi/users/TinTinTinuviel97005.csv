He believes that his upbringing, telling him first that objectifying women was wrong, then that pornography was wrong, set a roadblock to his desire to sexualize women now--that thinking that women ""can't do that"" and ""that's just weird"" is a form of objectification of women as well.

He finishes out the conversation talking about how he wants nothing more than a family, that connection, those ties that he can't have if he's homosexual.

My brain can't handle being stressed any further and I think of it as a decision, but it's not really voluntary, just to be amused instead. Like I go outside myself and decide to laugh *at* me. I don't know if I'm explaining it right. But it's happened two or three times, and I found myself emotionally capable after.

Edited to add: Yes, it seemed more a hysterical, maniacal laughter than my usual enjoyment. But it's definitely amusement I felt."

You shouldn't want to sleep with someone who's not interested in you.

It's not like the movies where she'll change her mind later when you do one awesome thing after all the mistakes. You may have to cut your losses, but now is a good time to work on not making a bunch of mistakes."

JustNoSO,fgumxue,t3_f0fkcc,1581124756.0,"So, this is a long shot. But, uh, there's a slight possibility that your husband may love you, but not feel as loved as he wishes. Ask him what you can do to make him feel more secure in your love.

(Only if you think you can still trust him enough to work things out.)

It could be that you can resecure his loyalty to you through lots of hard work and *him* getting therapy. But I'm not assigning a high probability to this.... So you need to decide if that road is worth venturing down for you."
AskMen,fgulcyz,t1_fgtx9a1,1581123692.0,"See, I had the opposite experience learning to enjoy being single. When I got out of my first long relationship I realized that I have a way I like life, and that sex and relationships come second to that. When the next relationship came along, we would get into fights because he wanted to feel needed and I didn't want to feel burdened. We both realized that fixing ourselves or each other would have a hard limit, but that we should talk about our expectations at each new difficulty. And I have been able to look at every problem and ask myself, ""Is this better than being single?"" When the answer is no, then it's up to my partner to change or leave. It has been bumpy, but I owe myself happiness.

It reads as though you're doing the opposite, conforming yourself however necessary to a person who may make you miserable because you're terrified of staying alone."

I express a lot through touch and I need quality time as a rule, but my SO needs and uses words, so we've had to work on that (I use words more often, he dedicates time to just us).

I'm not sure if I believe the Love Languages concept is scientific, but it sure does work when I apply it."

The quote may be misattributed, but it's true we shouldn't be judging a fish for its ability to climb a tree. Now, I 100% agree with the other comments urging you to see a professional to address your particular health issues. But also understand that the full-time college picture in our heads is often a pipe dream, and it doesn't have the guarantee of success that it used to.

You may consider part-time college, or even one class at a time. You may consider using your janitorial work as a stepping stone into a different industry (thorough, attention to detail, timeliness, commitment are great resume words), or joining the military, which isn't right for everyone but you're no stranger to physical labor."

AskReddit,fghcoq5,t1_fggtrz2,1580781891.0,"You may have to do the defining here, because I've never heard a definition that involves genocide, outside of the argument ""God is good, therefore everything he does is good"" which is in itself a circular argument (those who use it can't explain what goodness is without using their God in the definition--think ""Big Brother good"" and you'll understand what I mean).

I derive my perception of ethics from humanism, which stresses logic and empathy. So I guess if you can use reasoning for supporting murder and slavery and torture (or threats thereof) that show they are the most logical and empathetic actions, I would have to consider that these things may be ""good."""

AskReddit,fgea9x1,t1_fge3uxg,1580694961.0,"That was avoiding the point. All Abrahamic faiths place ultimate value on worship in return for a promise with zero guarantee (and some of those promises are weak indeed: ""in heaven you will spend eternity worshipping the deity that made you suffer through life?"" Eek), and most of those religions promise eternal suffering with also zero guarantee, in return for finite ills. I agree that I personally value truth and curiosity more than happiness, but I am a driven person--driven by inquiry, logic, empathy. These are all bound together, as helping others is key to increasing knowledge, increasing knowledge is key to helping others."

I try to do the same for others. If someone has feelings for me I won't do anything about it unless they make ""moves."" If the friendship suffers as a result of my rejection, then I didn't cause that. When it feels like someone won't take no for an answer, I tend to enlist outside help."
