Look at boosting your immune system (supplements, food etc) as this REALLY helps the body fight what it can of the cells. It also helps the visible warts! Just to be clear, genital warts and HPV are the same thing - so you probably didn't catch anything twice.

Big virtual hug for you, I know it's so hard.
