Tomasino,fpv36n9,t1_fpv0d6t,1588933244.0,"I'm not familiar with the subjects na you're gonna take agad sa first year since from what I understand, wala na kayong gen ed classes ðŸ˜… Pero I recommend reading or atleast mafamiliarize mo yung mga topics sa anatomy and physiology para di ka maoverwhelm esp when you get to have practical tests sa lab."
Tomasino,fpuyo2x,t3_gfp7te,1588928439.0,"Hi!! Mt alum heree hehe. 

Venipuncture is understandably scary for first timers. Pero speaking from experience eh practice lang talaga dapat gawin para mas masanay ka, all the while following the instructions ng prof mo. Kailangan talaga ng lakas ng loob and slight confidence in yourself!! Pag nag fail ka mag hit ng vein sa una its okay!! Learn from your experience and eventually chill ka na lang esp bec of muscle memory hehe. Goodluck!!"
