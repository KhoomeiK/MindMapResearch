depression,eqyxlsc,t3_bzutmf,1560390936.0,I'm sorry about what's happening. I was talking to a therapist before and I felt pressure to leave because of my mom. She didn't understand what was wrong with me and she seemed upset so I felt guilty and decided to leave and risk my own health so that my mom wouldn't feel upset that her child was deppressed and suicidal. I guess she thinks I'm feeling better know that I left therapy but I dont really feel any better.
