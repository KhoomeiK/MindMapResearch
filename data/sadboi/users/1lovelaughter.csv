RATS,fq4v3yo,t3_gguqgf,1589084877.0,"Vets can be quite expensive and it can be hard to find one that takes small rodents. I recently had to take one of my boys in for a check up which was $60, and then the medicine was $12. I called 5 vets and only found one that takes rats. I‚Äôm not sharing this to say what you should or shouldn‚Äôt do, but to just provide more information.

A good place to start would be to look into what your situation would be. Maybe call some vets and see if they take rats, and what a check up would cost, etc."

Not to mention they can help find the triggers, underlying causes, patterns, habits, etc. it‚Äôs helped me a ton."

lawofattraction,fpfbgz7,t3_gd4frg,1588566505.0,"Hey there! I‚Äôm super new to this, so take what I say with that perspective.

It would be useful to meditate for a few minutes everyday and visualize your face looking perfect and how you want it, and how that would feel. Don‚Äôt focus on the absence of scar specifically, but just the overall loveliness of that perfect face. Enjoy it, feel it as if it is now, etc. Then if after one of these meditation sessions you feel inspired to take an action, take it! And if not, just enjoy the peace of your manifestation coming to you. If you sense you are trying to force it into existence take a step back.

Another thing that could be useful is every time you see the scar in the mirror, rather than focusing on how you want it gone or how much you dislike the look of it, focus on how much you love your face. ‚ÄúLove what you have now and you create more of it‚Äù kind of thing. 

But also don‚Äôt just bulldoze your natural emotional response. In my experience that just makes negative feelings/thoughts louder in the long run. I.e. if you feel a negative emotion about yourself as a result of seeing the scar, it could be useful to spend some time evaluating that feeling and listening to it so you can repair that part of yourself. Build the sense of self love in that respect, because lacking that is a big block. It‚Äôs as if a neglected part of you is crying out for help, if that makes sense. If a part of you is hurt you can‚Äôt just pat it in the head and tell it it‚Äôs not hurt and expect things to get better.

I ended up saying a whole lot more than I meant too! You ended up with more of a psychology lecture than an answer to your question, but hopefully there was something useful for you in there.

I‚Äôd love to hear updates about your journey if you feel like sharing!"
lawofattraction,foxaha2,t3_ga3ad8,1588138272.0,"One thing that helps me is manifesting that my positive thoughts and feelings will be very strong, and my negative thoughts and feelings will be very weak. It‚Äôs from the book ‚Äúthe secret‚Äù. It‚Äôs very nice later when I worry I‚Äôm self sabotaging because then all it takes it for me to remind myself something like ‚Äúthis is okay, because this process is so incredible and powerful that I can still have everything good even if I‚Äôm feeling negativity‚Äù if that makes sense.

Also emotional care in general is just very important. So I think it would be a mistake to not take the time you need to mourn what is an actual loss!"
lawofattraction,fox9u6k,t3_ga3cxn,1588137770.0,"I‚Äôm still learning. And I‚Äôve only successfully manifested a few small things so far that I could excuse away as coincidence if I was being skeptical. BUT I have drastically changed my life for better via manifesting good in general, and not being so specific just yet. So what I‚Äôm saying is, I focus on saying to myself, reminding myself, and believing that ‚Äúgood things happen to me ALL the time‚Äù. It‚Äôs easier for me to feel and hold on to. That way whatever it is I‚Äôm doing or pursuing I‚Äôm manifesting general positivity with it. And it makes me feel more confident going in, and less like I have to force a specific outcome by being ‚Äúproperly spiritual‚Äù. And honestly? Good things do happen to me all the time. Like multiple times a day.

Good luck!"

Emotional/mental:

Either terrible emotions or none at all. Like just nothing. Total pointlessness to the whole of my existence. Zero motivation or my whole world is falling apart and I can‚Äôt see any part of my life as not being a disaster. And when I‚Äôm not in hell week it‚Äôs hard to understand how I felt so awful about my awesome life.

Brain fog. Poor attention to detail. Inability to focus. Out of touch with my surroundings. Very accident prone.

My thoughts race. It‚Äôs basically like extreme rumination that I can‚Äôt stop. Very cyclical. Very negative. Often times this includes very intense suicidal tendencies. It‚Äôs like my mind is being pulled into a whirlpool at the bottom of a pit. Dramatic, I know.

Very sensitive. Resting state is angry and defensive.

Physical: 

Poor sleep. Exhaustion. Body aches. Fatigue.

Extreme appetite or no appetite. Swelling, bloating. I have mild allergies/intolerances to some foods that just flare right up. IBS (although not as bad as it used to be since I‚Äôve identified my trigger foods and drink more water)

Acneeeeeee üò¢ deep, painful, hormonal acne

PMDD,fg75hxl,t1_fg4jnrw,1580584476.0,"It‚Äôs a type of therapy. It stands for eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. The way my therapist explains it is that this therapy method taps into a similar process as what your brain uses while you‚Äôre sleeping. So just as a dream may feel like hours but really be 10 minutes or even 10 seconds, through emdr you can deal with trauma in a safe space and an accelerated rate. The therapist uses eye movement (similar to how your eyes move during the REM cycle of sleep) to engage this process in the brain.

For me I not only visualize things in a dream like way as I process it, but it also elicited a strong response from my body. I just felt things shift inside. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but it is very impactful. But I‚Äôve always stored stress or negativity in my body (I.e. neck tension, IBS, migraines, tmj, etc.) so it makes sense that I would react that way.
