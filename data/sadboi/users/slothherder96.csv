askdrugs,fcukxim,t3_eitvij,1577983292.0,"not sure if this helps, I live in a city where cocaine use has become increasingly popular for daily use over the past few years. Most of my friends had developed this habit at one point (including myself.) I knew of friends buying a few grams or a ball a day and going through in an hour or so. I had friends who started selling it so they could have it all the time. I had a friend who sold it and I hung out with him all the time, I never really used blow till I started hanging out with him. He would literally use everyday to the point where his teeth looked horrible (years of selling and doing coke, we are only 24) his skin was covered in sores, and he looked so thin. My problem was a little different, I did coke almost every day 3-5 times a week at least but I made my problem worst, I had a low dose benzo script, so whenever I I felt any kind of ""crash"" I would take one feel a lot (till I felt way worse later). I never really crashed all the way, I fell in this habit for about two months?. Ive seen my friends and myself hit rock bottom but never completely crash. Now pretty much everyone stays away from the coke around our city. The only daily coke user I know if my former friend I mentioned earlier who sold. Most people I know have started to cut ties with him, he's been acting more and more aggressive lately, staring fights over pity things, accusing everyone of stealing from him or owing him money (him and his girlfriend really owe everyone else from because buying coke was important than paying rent or feeding their pets), being abusive towards his girlfriend. Just over all going through some kind of coke psychosis it seems. 

hope it was kind of helpful!"
