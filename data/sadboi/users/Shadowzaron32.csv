death,fqqztb7,t3_gkfbm1,1589574961.0,you did her and her family right by staying there by her side. It's all any of us can ask. I believe the family will respect that and thank you. We all fear dying alone and she didn't have to

death,fqo5z3e,t3_gjzg8p,1589508257.0,not wise to give answers to this. You do not want to give ideas to those who are struggling because they might just act on one of them. I urge everyone to consider that before they answer

StarWarsEU,fqjqswc,t3_gj954n,1589413853.0,I always liked scout of the clone commando/imperial command series. A under used character who had a interesting perspective on things in the galaxy. She was right in the point of shaping who she would be either as a jedi or as a adult. She is very little respected or supported.  Just a throwaway character

I doubt you'll really consider it but you underestimate the strength of humans at moments of crisis. A short well of strength to call on if you have enough of a reason to fight for. We are resilient. Calling on a last the strength you have to hold for a bit longer is not unheard of"

intrusivethoughts,fq6lar7,t3_ggu5ie,1589133710.0,I'm doing this right now. I shut down Facebook because I realized no one cares and a huge part of me just wants someone to notice.. I guess it's a call for a little attention and in the 3 days no one has messaged me so it's like having zero impact and zero interest from those you thought who cared. It's a really tough thought process to have
mentalhealth,fq4lx4k,t3_ggsq0w,1589079406.0,this is one of the top 3 reasons I'm afraid to date. It's so very easy to get clingy and obsessed and I'm clueless how to stop it. It's natural we want to be loved and treasured and show it but how much is to much and where does it become clingy? I hope you can figure it out and share your knowledge
lastimages,fq49gy7,t1_fq2o31j,1589075012.0,"or only the ones who really care will see through it and keep asking. That's how i've come to see it. So many ""friends"" fall for smiles and memes but only the true have taken the time to learn you and can see the hidden truth and smoke we put up and keep pushing at it until you burst. i am struggling really really really badly with depression and bi-polar these days and that's all i want. Not someone to say ""i'll listen"" but to be persistent and not let me get any with my lies and the fake smiles. Those are the ones you need to keep. No one has done that yet but i know they won't and i'll have to put up with it. Only true friends can have that affect some internet stranger can't do nearly enough because you don't know them or trust them. We fight hard battles and we don't just share them with random peoples.

sex,fq1n65p,t1_fpy6iqg,1589047150.0,hence why i refuse to have anything to do with it. With such little distance between the anus and vagina it's all to easy to slip up and have this happen.

sex,fpy6smr,t1_fpy2pye,1588997260.0,right right I understand what you mean. never actually considered it as you can't cross to the next stage without all that tier done. I can tell and agree looking at it from a very long celibate streak that you don't need sex or anything physical to move to the next stage and be somewhat satisfied. I like any else is scattered all over the place on that list. It's a really good point my friend. I really need to devote time to looking more into the background of the hierarchy and really understand how he got there

sex,fpxlhol,t1_fpxbt8l,1588984828.0,surely you can't expect a conservative abstinence only school system to say anything like this? it's akin to praising the devil in a Christian church lol. Bring the wrath of every parent down on them. Nope it has to be abstinence or nothing
sex,fpwzw57,t3_gfyoa4,1588973031.0,maslow's hierarchy of needs lists sex as one of 7 or 8 basic ground needs to having a happy mind and body. It is of no doubt it has such a impact on our minds

They try to talk to someone they lose their whole lives and everything they care about over a interest. Everything they have put their time into all their friends and all you can think of. Would you lose everything in your life to talk about something your interested in but don't do? ya i don't think so
ActualPublicFreakouts,fpkq1mj,t1_fpid6xe,1588699049.0,I bet some of the shooters in the past have been pedophiles for your exact reasoning. They are just like you and me outside of interests and can obtain weapons just the same. I wouldn't be at all surprised if there is talk about it in the deepest part of the web. It has and will happen over and over.. this is the way it's going to be.
ActualPublicFreakouts,fpkpdc6,t1_fpk8hh2,1588698719.0,would have to be a 100% secure thing for anything to work. Any pedo alive for longer 15 years knows not to trust a soul.

mentalhealth,fpg85vw,t1_fpfhksp,1588596869.0,okay Jake sure man assume I don't have a idea with wanting to die every single day with wanting to OD on something or jump in front of a train. Assume I have no idea about being lonely and hating every minute of it. Of wanting to scream and shout and know I can't because I'll be thrown in a hospital and be forced to pay several hundred dollars for feelings. Of forcing myself not to walk down to the store and buy a deadly mix. Of lookin for a reason to live and not finding many. Sure jake believe what you want. What the shitty reaction to people trying to help you. You ask for help and turn on those who try.

We're all fighting the same battle and I wish I could tell you how I'm still here but idk truly just too stubborn to die I guess. Every day I want the same thing as you do. All I know is we just keep fighting and refusing to let this time period break us no matter how much we may crave it. Personally I'm focusing on games and pure distraction. Talking to anyone I can listening to music going for walks and anything else. Just do all you can to distract yourself for these thoughts and keep fighting. There is no easy way out of this and it comes down to who is stronger your will or your illness. Look for reasons to decide make yourself laugh and don't think about anything but the now

Mariners,fp641uj,t3_gb0teh,1588345674.0,I think jon bois has more love for this team than most fans do. He understands what most don't. What keeps us rooting. That moment with the players carrying ichiro and griffey and the applause and smiles on everyone's faces is all it's about.
TooAfraidToAsk,fp5oijb,t3_gbcpob,1588336021.0,emojis don't really mean anything or carry the power words do. It can be a lot funnier to see someone type their reaction than just a emoji.

Don't get me started on the Juno thing. nothing anakin says or does gets close.

hingeapp,fp3a4tr,t1_fp09180,1588275747.0,You put too much focus on physical. That is not the only thing that matters. Straight telling you that from a early 30's. Looks being the only important line for anyone looking is for the shallow ones. Your personality is what matters. Your interests. They last long beyond yours or others looks.
StarWarsEU,fp377jw,t1_fp36g31,1588274291.0,i find it funny how people dislike the books yet they answer so many questions.. if i recall right this is the series jacen get's his vision? that drives him down the dark path? i mean it's got so many good things in it and it's disliked because of bugs? they answer questions that are asked rather often on places like quora and even some of the legends facebook groups. It's in plain writing and it is really well played out with R2 having one of the few stubborn disobedient moments having hid the info so far in his mind that he can't even really access it if he wanted to. Takes ghent forcing it out of him to see the truth. Poor R2 seeing so much shit
StarWarsEU,fp334hp,t1_fp30zqx,1588272271.0,yes that's what everyone is missing. The luke/padme stuff and the reveal of what R2 knows about anakin's fall showing it to luke and mara
StarWarsEU,fp330m6,t3_gayzag,1588272220.0,A good amount of people have tried it and still hate it. i personally love the bits out of it for your reasons.

MLBTheShow,fp31ua8,t1_fp2hrwk,1588271650.0,"to be fair a low curve is a lot easier to pick up than a pitch that just slams into the glove in a flash. You can train yourself to pick up on the break of a curve even more a low one but not so easy with a pitch that is based around guessing the general location in a blink. Completely different approaches. I always fall for such pitches because i go up with one approach and professional hitters always talk about ""adjusting your approach mid at bat"" ha no i go up there thinking fastball you can throw me any sort of curve and i'm going down in a flash. Just can't hold off"
mentalillness,fp23c47,t3_gao19j,1588254291.0,"and yet people wonder why there is so much suicide... they give you the clique ""call a number and go to a hospital"" making themselves feel like they did something good but they don't understand what that MEANS and does.

morbidquestions,foymkj2,t1_foym7la,1588175220.0,ohh for sure. I mean pure legality wise. The law understands attraction is no crime. Doesn't stop the judge from tearing the offender to pieces and ordering more time. Let's just say they wouldn't be leaving prison
morbidquestions,foyl7c6,t1_foyiw2v,1588174512.0,Yup I would agree. Taking the edge off of the craving for action. Calm that part of the mind same way as legal porn does. Sounds like it would work in concept
morbidquestions,foykwdc,t1_foya72r,1588174358.0,you are technically right legally. It's a attraction not a crime. Liking something is not a crime the action is. Yes be mad at me for stating the law people.

everett,fov5j5t,t1_foti5pa,1588095724.0,i am sorry that i can't do much more to help you than asking to you to call them. Section 8 can be really tricky with their rules and being able to ask them clearly stating your needs is about the only real way to make sense out of it. The typical rent in everett as far as i can know sits around 1100-1700 depending on what place you want. I know they changed the rules up and changed the funding amounts but i can't tell you for sure. I hope they are able to answer you clearly and give you the info you need
everett,fou5rec,t3_g9hvpa,1588076929.0,yup what you are seeing is about right. I am on section8 as well and can tell you that the voucher scales with current rent. Talk to the king county housing authority and they will tell you. It's pricey but it's doable

Ah now i'm all sad about the end of all of this. I'm glad it was given a fitting end. Really fits the feel of jude watson and her jedi apprentice books along with the other young adult novels.

Master yoda said ""once you start on the dark path it will forever consume your path"" (not exact wording i don't think) the dark side asks for hate the craving for power, to crush those that are weaker than you, the light side asks for sympathy healing and support of the weak.. ask yourself do those go together? do those mesh? no my friend they do not. They ask two separate ways of living and acting. To access one of the other is to walk that path. The dark side is like a poison as shown by what it does to the bodies of sith lords and every time a jedi does something in anger (accessing the dark) that poison takes hold more and more. 
The original concept of a grey jedi has just always been a jedi who is willing to not be a pure puppet of the council and the jedi rules and is willing to stand up for what they feel is right and argue even when they should be quiet. A maverick. That's basically it. Nothing to do with the dark side.. Revan argued endlessly against the council and ran off to war but never used to dark or fell. He would be the ideal grey jedi. Using things that the council and order frowns on for the greater good of the universe. He saved so many lives but did it in ways the council said no to. The dark side is the poison that the jedi are not going to access. 

There has only been one jedi in the history of the order that ever uses the dark side and pulled out of it in one piece and that is mace windu in his fighting style of vappad. It requires him to enjoy the fight to want his opponent to thrive on engagement and the look on his enemies face. Not very jedi things. Take sora bulq for a example here. He and windu created vappad but sora fell to the dark side of the force do to it the requirements being to much for his mind to handle. Same thing with legends depa billiard. Vappad and the dark drove her crazy. Very few jedi could ever use the dark and not be drawn to it. 

Kyp durron of NJO fame would be another great example of a grey jedi as it was meant to be using aggressive tactics and being on the offense against the vong when luke and mara and the rest said no don't do it. He never ever used the dark side during that process hell he ever drug back jaina solo from the edge of the dark side. Qui-gon is another who would just argue with the council as obi-wan mentioned in TPM. 
""i am no jedi"" - ashoka tano. The best way to see ashoka is a non affiliated light sider. She chooses to help the jedi and the light side but is not bound to any order or rules just going where she wants doing what she can. 

On a side note you may recall i mentioned the kyle katarn philosophy in my main post? what i mean by that is kyle's belief is that a jedi can use any ability in combat with only the intent mattering to what the ability is. Aka a jedi using force choke as long as it isn't in anger or anything of the dark side. Luke actually agreed with that at one point like during the swarm war trilogy but drifted away finding a different view on it. Still he never stopped kyle from what he was doing because he understood that kyle knew what he was doing and could rely on him to be the most stalwart defender of the light.. i wonder if the jedi during yoda's order could understand the same what would happen? would they support revan in his march and stop him from being dragged to the dark by the emperor?
The term grey jedi has been blown out of proportion and twisted by fans who just want a powerful uber god being zwho can do anything and use anything they want at anytime.

TLDR: (it's a lot i know) 
1. Nope that's not the way the force works. Both sides want different things and it's like a poison to a jedi.
2. A common belief but as you can tell not one that makes a lot of sense. A jedi is what we see in the books and novels. No dark side there.
3. A unaffiliated force user, grey force user. Either one or ya know just no title at all"

dating,forer6t,t1_foqefb4,1588010986.0,as much as we want to deny it.. it slaps you in the face in time making you realize just how lonely you are
CoronavirusWA,forejvr,t3_g91pec,1588010889.0,last i was in the everett mall way walmart in everett they had 4 registers up and 4 self check out. They have plastic screens in front of the touch pad but that's about it. I do notice that the target had a line out front so.. i'm not really 100% positive when things may change there

 i agree fully with what you mean though friend just i'm pretty sure it's stated several times that the dark side will dominate your future forever (granted was wrong with anakin but that was a really unusual circumstance) and that instantly disproves the ""you can use both"" argument. I've always looked at it like a drug and sure you may get away using it once but the second time? third? your hooked

The closest you'll get to that is the kyle katarn belief but even that believes using a power in aggression is still the path to darkness"
LegendsMemes,fookm2r,t3_g8lwy9,1587940839.0,"Of course it's a good idea to have jedi who have the guts to argue with the council and disagree with their orders being willingly to push the rules in order to help those in need without falling to the dark or using any of it. Jedi who are willing to be more than good little pawns. Jedi like revan qui-gon anakin (in a minor way)  
The common belief of a dual wielding maniac ""fence sitter"" is comical this we can agree on.  
(heh sorry i'm just a wee bit passionate on this)"
IBSHelp,folgayl,t1_fol7w5e,1587861608.0,i wasn't aware of that.. glad you said something
ShouldIbuythisgame,fol70q9,t3_g80qti,1587856130.0,Nope it's actually pretty simple to be a new player. It's more than worth the adventures with your friends. Just grab and go you won't regret it
IBSHelp,fol6osc,t3_g7yo2i,1587855944.0,One thing that always seems to work to stop the body pain is fiber. Just a glass of flavor free fiber and he will feel better for a good amount of time. It would be no different than drinking a glass of water but with that added effect. Won't matter the side of the pond for that. The pills can make it worse as another commenter notes (don't know how to tag another person) so be careful with those. Getting the weight back up.. i am afraid i don't know. If you are going to take meds watch those side effects.
shamelessplug,foktl5l,t3_g81axl,1587848695.0,This is surpassingly a fun game. It may just be a button smasher but there's a charm to it.
tumblr,fokn8o6,t1_fokmngs,1587845245.0,haha i admit it kinda was. it was in.. 6'th or 7'th so the embarrassment was on pure display but once you just got into it and stopped caring the smiles and laughs just started coming out. One of my fondest memories and now that i think of it i may have to put that on a dating bucket list.. you might just have to try it yourself? never thought to use hamster dance but really it works out
tumblr,fokmrw2,t1_fojlq3y,1587844991.0,No my friend not true it gives those who are about to lose their lives do to bias and bullying a place to go and be part of where they are accepted as the normal human beings they are. It gives hope to those who need it. It gives a outlet for the reality of someone in a society that would have rather crushed them down and imagined they don't exist. It does so much for the spirit there's no true way to describe it. No my friend it is the anti-lgbt crowd who choose to hate gatherings and uplifting do to their own believes. They target the gatherings and parades for their own reasons. I am not angry at your opinion or biased towards you or any of that
tumblr,fokkmp7,t1_fojkade,1587843830.0,not sure that's as bad as learning to square dance with the hamster dance song playing on the pull down screens in the middle of the damn gym. That shit was both wtf and really fun lol
PrequelMemes,fokbpur,t1_foje80v,1587839085.0,i know jake was aware of us having joined perhaps the biggest star wars group of facebook and doing a few interviews before he had his issues. I think i might have seen ahmed as well
