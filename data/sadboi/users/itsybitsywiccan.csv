BipolarReddit,eymmzg1,t3_cvhqxk,1567213817.0,"I was put on Prozac as a 15 year old to help me sleep. Caused me to go manic just within the next few weeks after starting. I ended up in a psych hospital after just a month. That was where they falsly diagnosed me with depression but only after a few months of my symptoms coming out more and more still on only the SSRI was I diagnosed bipolar. 

Sometime I wonder if I would be having as much trouble as I currently do if I had never started taking that pill and had just tried something else for my sleep."
