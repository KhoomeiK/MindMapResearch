I saw this post getting way out of hand both here and in a Facebook group where it’s been screenshotted and wanted to tell you that I hope you’re not too shaken over the growing reactionary mob mentality on social. It seems like more of us are losing our minds from being cooped up inside with fewer face-to-face interactions.

You seem like a nice young man with room to improve in the communication department, not some highly toxic scumbag who wants to bang his brother’s girlfriend. You love your girl and you notice clothing that would flatter her body. You’re secure enough in your masculinity to recognize that appreciating fashion doesn’t make you any less of a straight man.

(Longish personal anecdote ahead)

My husband and I got into some fights over my clothing choices earlier in our relationship. He and most of his friends are Silicon Valley engineers and/or successful alumni from his prestigious university making bank and as a result, their clothing choices reflect a different level of class than mine as a childcare provider. 

At his birthday party our first year together, he sent a FB invite that merely said “wear purple” as the dress code. I showed up in a vibrant purple tee shirt, skinny jeans, and Chucks thinking I looked really cute. After, he commented that I was dressed too casually and that I should’ve seen that he chose a fancy restaurant downtown and dressed better. (To this day, I honestly don’t think it was that fancy. Nice, but the type of nice where jeans are totally fine.) 

I resented him for quite some time after that. It took us some time for us to be at peace with that socioeconomic divide and communicate/prepare for events more effectively. Even now, 8 years later and 3 years into marriage, it’s a lot of work. 

Over time, he gifted me more upscale clothes that we both like. He gave constructive feedback at times when I was open to it. The phrases, “Do you want some advice?/Do you want to know what I think?” have been so valuable. We agreed that he would let me know ahead of time the level of fancy at each event and how he planned to dress. We also agreed that I had full control over my clothing choices and that he would give no feedback unless solicited, and that if solicited, I would not get mad.

bipolar2,fmary9a,t3_fttkzt,1585905430.0,"Your sister’s very lucky to have your support! All of the self-care you mentioned - working out, playing with the dog, something leisurely like TV, will benefit the kids too. The kids need routine just as much as we do. It might be worth exploring what self-care activities you can do alongside the kids. The YouTube channel Cosmic Kids Yoga has yoga/mindfulness practices geared towards young children that you can do with them. They’re kinda silly/cutesy and sometimes have little themes - outer space, Frozen, Moana, pets, etc. For more cardio, maybe a dance party.

I am a former teacher and sometimes when a student is slower to understand something, they don’t necessarily need a lot of handholding and individual instruction that you weren’t trained to give. It might just be a matter of giving her time/space to marinate, make mistakes, and work it through. Maybe she needs more “brain breaks”. If you can get in touch with the teacher, they’ll have better insight on how to best work with her. 

Hang in there!! 💞"

AskOldPeople,flylm7p,t1_flyl3un,1585604453.0,I remember reading somewhere that children who watched a lot of Teletubbies were behind their peers in language skills because the characters babbled rather than using real words. It was a weird show.
AskOldPeople,flygcou,t1_flydjxh,1585601644.0,"I remember my aunt shutting off Barney before my cousin could even get a chance to watch it. She would watch Sesame Street right before Barney came on and as soon as the Barney theme song started...*click*. My cousin would ask, “Why don’t you ever let me watch that show, mom?” and my aunt would reply, “You’re not gonna like it.” Cousin would say, “Well, -I- think I will...” and aunt kept shutting that down - “Nope. You won’t.” Smart woman."
