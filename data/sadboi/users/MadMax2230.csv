TheMidnightGospel,fo29um3,t1_fo207s4,1587454482.0,"One of the things that got to me that I didn't include was how the mom responded by saying crying was a way to cope. When my mom passed I couldn't cry, I think I just felt so disconnected because I put up these walls to shield me from the pain of life. I rarely cried, but recently I have been. I've found that the memory of my mom doesn't make me sad, but it's more of the love and the connection we had, especially when I was little.

If I had any advice it would be to cherish the time you have. No one can replace a mother. My mom loved me in a way that I don't think any one else would be able to.

That's a good idea, sent him a shorter version to his instagram dms.

musictheory,fa9pa5a,t1_fa9fh1h,1575884599.0,technically guitar has a lot less notes but repeated notes with different timbres.
musictheory,fa9p865,t3_e8349u,1575884512.0,"I learned to relate things in terms of intervals really well. For example low e string 5th fret to a string 3rd fret is a minor third. Same thing for every other place on guitar except G to B. I do this for chords as well, 5x665 is the same as I x M7 M3 P5. The major seven is just a semitone below the octave.

I think piano is easier for someone without a strong music theory and ear training background, but for someone who does have that guitar can be pretty easy. Modulating to different keys is so much easier and relationships between notes are easier to visualize. For example a major 6 can look way different depending on which note you start on piano, but on guitar there are a only a few shapes that are moveable up and down the fretboard."

freewill,esn8fuy,t1_esn3jhw,1562125259.0,"I feel like you're using several staw man arguments here and you aren't really making sense.

You can't flip a coin and say if heads your birthday comes first, tails mine does. That's not how it works. You can decide who buys by tossing a coin or who buys by birthdays if both individuals agree upon the selected method beforehand. But whatever is decided, variables beyond control will lead the individuals to whatever choice they made, and causal nature will lead the event to happen the way it happens. And if randomness is involved then it is still not up to the individual to decide, as their decision is still based on factors that ultimately stem from outside forces out of their control. Not to say they shouldn't decide, but that they should understand that their decision is based on factors outside of their control.

The reason for the argument about free will is to challenge the belief that it is people's fault's for their actions. It's rather the genetic predispositions and surrounding environment that leads people to be the way they are and make the actions they made. The reason I am who I am has not been up to me, it's been up to things outside of my control. I didn't have the free will to be who I wanted to be, and the origins of my motives stemmed from a place outside of my control. Our society heavily criticizes people for thinking the wrong way or doing the wrong thing, as if they committed sins. But it isn't their fault they lack understanding and knowledge, or had the wrong justifications for actions. Obviously people still need to be jailed for going against the laws that govern society, but punishing people for retribution is a whole different thing. . So in this sense I think this view of free will is important for empathy and understanding.

And I read through your post you linked, but that is still your own conjecture over what free will and compatibilism are, not what is agreed upon. And I do not think your arguments are valid or sound. This is how I would structure your argument to be both.

1) a determined world is fully computable

2) actions are generated by minds

3) computational theory of mind is correct

4) therefore, there cannot be freely willed actions in a determined world.

If the world is deterministic, the mind is computational, and actions are generated by the mind then there is no ""free"" will at all.

Edit: I think you should read this: https://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/september/compatibilism-perry-philosophy-091511.html"
freewill,esn2tuv,t1_esms4rd,1562121222.0,"Honestly I think you are completely misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying that if you roll the dice it is possible for science to predict what number it lands on and what shorts you pick. I'm saying that you rolling the dice was an action that depending on the inherent laws of physics; it had to land on the number it landed on based on the way you threw it. And why did you throw it that way? Based on pre existing neurological conditions in your brain that dictated that you throw it with that much force. Now I'm not saying we can reliably and scientifically get all this data to predict how the dice would land, it's incomprehensible. However, the nature of reality runs on these rules of the universe, which govern uncountable interactions between all objects. Humans will never be able to accurately predict this.

And as for your shorts experiment, you are confusing one variable with multiple. There are millions to an incomprehensible number of interactions involved in this specific scenario of picking pants, to a point where it seems ""random"" when it is not. You are making the situation extremely complex, and then trying to say it is predictable with a few dice and probabilities. This is not what I've been arguing. 

You can't find out whose birthday comes soonest by tossing a coin. I don't know where you got to that point as that has nothing to do with the concept of determinism. Science is just observation, but that doesn't mean that just because certain interactions aren't fully observable they won't necessarily follow the rules of the universe. Everything that we've observed so far follows these rules, and even if the quantum scale of things doesn't, the particle and above scales still do and aren't affected by this lower scale. 

I don't think you actually understand the concept of compatibilism either. It really hinges on the definition of free will. If someone votes for a candidate they did it out of their own free will, and if someone forced them not to then they didn't correct? Well this is the compatibalist version of free will. Having the freedom to vote for who you want is great and no one argues you shouldn't have this ability. But the personal motives of the individual to vote are still driven by determinism and are not free in a sense, because the motives rely on other factors completely not up to the decision maker, such as their genetic predisposition, other individuals, books that have come across their path, and whatever else. It's a complex web of factors, that were never up to the individual to pick. You may have the illusion of free will, and being able to ""choose"" yourself, but it's really up to variables out of your control. Compatibalists don't disagree with this notion. 

It seemed to me that you were arguing for the sake of the notion that your actions are somehow yours. Nearly everyone (at least in the U.S.) believes in this idea because it seems obvious and it serves the ideas of punishment and right and wrong in our society. I can't really know why you were arguing as it is just my perception, but you just seemed defensive as if I was challenging some core belief that you hold near and dear."
freewill,esm3pqq,t1_eskbd9b,1562097596.0,"You seem rather defensive when posting these responses. I get the feeling that your arguing for the sake of some deeply held conviction you have, and not for the sake of discussion.

Your argument for the 3 tenants of free will applies to determinism as well. What determinists argue is that your ""choice"" is not really a choice, but an illusion. If you rewound time would you choose the same option again? The answer is likely yes. It's hard to envision why this is the case, but it is theorized that every interaction is predictable with a large enough computing power. 

What is mind boggling is the degrees of complexity in which every day life deals with. Think of the billions of bacteria cells that are crawling in and on your body at this very moment. It's incomprehensible, but still, if we had enough knowledge about the cells that makeup you and a near infinite computing ability it's likely that your actions could be predicted. In fact, even me writing this response back to you had many causal events and interactions leading up to it. So far through our observations, everything follows the inherent rules of the universe, and it's unlikely that you don't because you're an exception to that rule. For the stars, planets, and galaxies to break these rules would be wildly inconsistent with what we know. And for a single planet among the stars to break these rules would be even more wildly inconsistent.

So it seems to me that in a sense everything we hear see and do was predestined since the birth of the universe. No matter how you try to play the game of life, or circumvent the notion of determinism, every action you take is not your own. But that's the beauty of the universe to me, the fact that we can't help but be along for the ride for this mystifying and strange experience."
freewill,esjeu2x,t1_esjcte7,1562031704.0,"I don't think the origin of things has anything to do with how similar something is to something else. If a human was created by some divine deity or by evolution it is still a human. Same thing with a computer. We've already started making adaptive AI, that change their code as they get new information. What's to say that the first single celled organism wasn't designed by an outside influencer in much the same way? I'm not saying it was, but I think it's a good argument to make for perspective.

As for the causal reason for you putting on a tie, think about your prior experiences in life. Seeing friends or family putting on ties before going to work, learning that it is some sort of a cultural necessity for you to do so in order to live your life. Your reasons are governed by causes that shape your actions and who you are. It's why you didn't go to work wearing a Hawaiian shirt and socks and sandals. Your brain has taken input throughout your life and reasoned with it to tell you that wearing a tie to work is a good idea. For you to do otherwise would mean that something led you to think that not wearing one would be a good idea. 

And I'm not saying reasons and causes aren't distinct, just that all reasons are governed by causes (stimuli) whether you like it or not."
freewill,esjbeg2,t1_esj8tdx,1562029756.0,"Well much like a computer, we take in information (input), reason with it, possibly alter our subconscious thinking and reasoning (code) based on that input, and then possibly say our do something (output). Even though an individual might not be aware of it, every choice has some reason behind it, and even a supposed lack of a reason for doing a choice (being random or doing something just cause) has some root cause behind it. 

Also I phrased it in a misleading way. I should have said that we are computational in the same way a computer is, but a computer is likely not a conscious being."

freewill,esj6b92,t1_esj1gbr,1562026851.0,"This is a good response. However, the concept of awareness here seems to be unexplainable. How come evolution was able to churn out beings from natural selection that are able to experience things, even though the awareness doesn't necessarily have an evolutionary advantage. We are computational beings in the same way a computer is, but a computer is likely not conscious. Also how does an organism go from being an unaware cell which is much like a computer to a multicellular aware entity? It is baffling."
LetsTalkMusic,epsqncr,t1_epskbq0,1559460819.0,"I agree, and that raises an interesting point. What I think is ""good music"" may be personal preference for me, I'm not sure. I actually really enjoy motown music even though it is pretty formulaic, but something about that music strikes me as being better than popular genres from 90s and 2000s, like contemporary R&B and a lot of alternative music. Maybe it has to do with some music theory analysis of the types of chord progressions used, dissonance, or the timbre of instruments or something. Or it could just be personal bias.

LetsTalkMusic,epsfy7k,t1_eppozfu,1559447548.0,"Honestly I pulled a lot of my points out of my ass late last night, so you're right on the image thing. Same for the existing media idea. 

However, when making pop music, I'd argue that artists from that time didn't pull upon from some existing formula or already established hit music. Blues and folk were not chart toppers like 50s and 60s rock were. The 2000s in particular seemed to be increasingly formulaic among the most popular artists, because there was an already established formula for what constituted a hit song. 

I think I'm being misunderstood here, because when I said off the top of my head, I meant from when I was looking through lists of artists with the most top hits from their respective decades. Not from personal experience or my own ""rose colored lens"". Most music I listen to is from recent times and not 60s to 70s. There's good music from more recent times, just not as much overall in the top hits, in my opinion."

depression,eoezbuz,t1_eodxgz9,1558514464.0,"I'm sorry you've had these experiences. I was in the same place in high school up until recently. I think a lot of the old school thinkers can react this way, particularly family.

This thread seems to be really negative though, and from my experience it's these ruminating negative thoughts that made my depression worse. There are people that care, you either haven't met them yet or they know/understand that you're going through a hard time. It's not that ""nobody gives a fuck"" it's that there's a lot of people who lack understanding and empathy, there's still good people out there.

I also think many people who feel this way come across as seeking attention because of poor communication skills, and can't fully express how they feel inside. Finding ways to hang out with people can be really beneficial, having experience talking makes communication a lot easier. There's a lot of ways to meet new people, clubs, martial arts dojos, church groups (I used to attend one but am now atheist, still don't regret it), and many other avenues. 

Wanted to point out as well that for most people depression isn't a chemical imbalance, but an expression of a fucked up environment or lifestyle. For me it was an non empathetic family, lack of friends, and a fucked up perception of the world that really rocked my boat and made every day a living nightmare. Things will get better though as long as you try to experiment and work towards fixing your problems.
