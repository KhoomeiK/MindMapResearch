thank you in advance, she is currently skinnier than usual and i’m worried that this will progress more and she won’t be able to eat :(

AskReddit,fopwde3,t3_g88ccd,1587974351.0,"this happened when i was walking home alone at about 8 or 9 years old. i lived in the older part of town and it was really safe, so my older siblings didn’t have to wait for me and walk me home, and i think this day they were both at friends houses. when i was about 100m away from the school i saw a car behind me and it turned into one of the streets, which was a crescent, not suspicious at all. couple minutes later the same car came up behind me and pulled into another street. weird. he did this a few more times and my 8 year old self was terrified at this point and speed walking as far as my tiny legs could carry me. when i get to the street right before mine, there aren’t any more that he could go down so he just follows me very slowly and i pretend to be oblivious but there were tears running down my face at this point, and when i get to my driveway i sprint to my door to unlock it and get inside, and i watch as the car drives away. i stood there frozen but didn’t see the car come back for the 20 minutes or so that i was there, so i went to my room and took a nap and forgot all about it. 

i told my friend about it the next day and she said that her dad was in town to visit her and she pointed me out a few days before, so he waited for me to get out of the school and followed me so he could tell my friend what my address was. this guy was genuinely nice but had been in and out of jail for a few years on drug cases and fraud, and he was just a little nutty but no bad intentions. 

tl;dr got followed home when i was 8 or 9 and told my friend the next day and she told me it was her dad, who wanted to know my address to tell her. cool guy, little weird."

the teacher picked on her and she boasts “i learned that years ago from my daddy. he’s a math teacher. it’s 3.14!”

teacher looks impressed because she’s a total teachers pet, and by now i’ve realized that this is my time to shine. i’d always been good at remembers numbers for no reason, i would read the default wifi passwords you get before you set your own or peoples phone numbers once and they’d be in my head forever. 

so without missing a beat, i calmly recited the 40-or-so digits that i had memorized for fun a few months prior. i was very shy and my voice was shaking the whole time but i made it through and added at the end “you get the idea, it goes on for a while”

everybody was silent the whole time, and for about a minute after i finished. the teacher looked as if he was about to yell at me and i went red, as i thought i was in trouble and had completely embarrassed myself. he grabbed his computer and asked me to repeat the numbers because he only knew a few digits after the standard 3.14. i repeated them and they were all right. i think i blacked out a little after that because i don’t quite remember what the reaction from the class was, but i do remember that the know it all girl didn’t show up the next day and needless to say she never talked to me again"
