It has been a hard and shitty life and now youâ€™re going to do the one thing that can truly make you feel free of this broken mind and broken world. Iâ€™ll think of you..ðŸ’ž

depression,fls86vo,t3_fqquhp,1585436424.0,"In times like this you need your family more than ever. Keep them close to you and share your pain. And even if it hurts donâ€™t close out the memories of your mother. Youâ€™re going to miss her and every little thing is going to remind you of her. Itâ€™s part of the grieving process, donâ€™t suppress it. Youâ€™re going to ask yourself many questions, many what ifs but its important to remember that none of this is your fault, you arenâ€™t responsible for the decision your mother made. Whatâ€™s done is done and thereâ€™s no way for you to change it anymore sadly, im sorry. Let yourself feel, itâ€™s okay to break down. Youâ€™ve experienced a terrible loss and now itâ€™s on you to learn how to healthily deal with this situation.

I hope you and your family stay strong :)ðŸ’ž
