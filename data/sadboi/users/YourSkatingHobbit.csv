Granted, some people struggle with languages more than others but something is always better than nothing. 

However, if you’re going to visit somewhere very regularly even as a tourist, or settle in another country to live/work, then I think it’s an absolute must to learn the native language to at least a reasonable level of fluency. My mother is an immigrant, she speaks English better than me and my dad who are born-raised Brits, but she also raised me speaking her native language so I’m fully bilingual (I also speak reasonably good German). It doesn’t need to be a matter of either/or. I feel exactly the same way about Brits who move to Spain or southern France and speak no word of either language.

Happens on the train a lot too. There’s a woman who boards particular weekday train services to/from London (she gets on/off at intermediate stations without any barriers, and always at quiet times when the BTP aren’t likely to be patrolling the line).

They would split their proceeds between them and were open about how they genuinely didn’t want to be helped; they didn’t have to work a job, or pay rent or bills, all their money could go on what they wanted (drugs mainly). They picked pockets and bags. The guy usually on the footbridge would often go into the multi-storey station car park to hunt for cars with valuables to steal. They’d both stand just off station property so staff couldn’t do anything; police would move them on but they’d just come back. The guy on the town centre side would always be standing and plead for money as you approached, call you brother or sister, appeal to your humanity. If you’d ignore him he’d get in your face and become abusive, threaten to beat you; he once threatened to follow me home and rape me if I didn’t give him any money. Dude was basically a mugger. He vanished not long after that and I’ve not seen him since, so I assume he got arrested (if he didn’t either find a better spot or OD). His buddy remained on the footbridge for a long time: someone bought him a cheap pop-up tent so he lived at the end of the bridge until finally he disappeared as well."

Usually we get either a review copy on disc or a digital review code/key (we don’t *need* anything more than that).

That’s just my experience in the amateur enthusiast sector - BANDAI NAMCO are the only ones I’ve personally worked with who’ve had press kit editions (I’m on Ubi’s press list too but I’m nowhere near important enough to be considered for a CE gift so idk what they call them!)"

She told me age-appropriate truths when I asked questions. My dad is her second husband, and she’d already had a long-term relationship before her first marriage, so to preach abstinence would be hypocritical anyway. Her stance was always the belief that sex should be a private thing between the participants but not a taboo, because all that does is force a silence on something that is all about communication. As the author said himself, how can people learn to communicate effectively to have fun, safe and enjoyable sex when it’s a barred topic? 

I can’t say that sex has always been a comfortable topic for me personally as I was assaulted at sixteen (funnily enough, by a deeply religious Baptist boy), but it would’ve been so much worse had I not had the relaxed attitude to do with sex beforehand. I now have a loving boyfriend with whom I feel safe and have always been able to be completely open with. Meanwhile, a close friend who also grew up Catholic, and went to the high school I almost went to, didn’t know what a vagina was until she went to university.

I wept my way through that final conversation with him in Trespasser. 

What kept me invested, and still does, is partly the fact that I love a good tragic/tortured soul. He harbours so much pain, guilt and regret and that tugs at my heartstrings a lot. He’s also a powerful mage, which is just freaking cool. He can be sensitive and caring: he approves of you bringing food to the refugees, or finding them a healer. Plus, he’s a fount of knowledge, he’s well-read and studious, and underneath it all he cares deeply and passionately about that which is important to him. Those are things I look for in a partner irl. 

I also have to say that out of the romance arcs I’ve played, I find his is one to feel more natural and well-rounded. The hazard of a game where you can flirt from the word go is that romances can feel quite rushed, but his doesn’t imo. For instance: my current playthrough I have my dagger-wielding Dwarf dating Blackwall, and that took about three conversations before they were snogging, including the first flirt option during his recruitment, lol."

I can vouch for Overcooked too. If you’re into rhythm games then I can recommend Avicii: Invector, with the added bonus that purchasing it supports a mental health charity."

It might be slow, but it’s powerful (pretty sure handling only affects accuracy), it can blow the concussion sac on a Longlegs in one. Plus Tearblast arrows are an asset, especially against Stalkers to detach the stealth generator and machines like Thunderjaws which are huge, tough *and* have heavy weapons (which you can then pick up and use)."

The smell of the pages, the feel of it in my hands... plus they never run out of charge! I usually go with an audiobook to strike the balance."
