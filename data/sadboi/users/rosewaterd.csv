But as more time goes on I’ve noticed a man can have it all, and I can chase him, but as soon as it starts to get real, I almost get repulsed, and feel the need to distance myself. I do want a relationship, but personally deep down I don’t think I’m ready to accept love because I don’t feel I’m worthy of the love I want. 

What I’ve been doing is just reading books around this stuff and making a conscious effort to analyze my thoughts surrounding someone, like why do I feel this way? Is it based on something valid? 

I’ve also made it a point to not date until I know I can commit lol I’m upfront with everyone who tries with me, explaining that I don’t have it in me to be emotionally available because I have a lot of self worth issues and the fear of abandonment to work through. 

I think you’ll know you’re ready when you aren’t yearning so desperately for one, and when someone showing interest in you doesn’t deter you for no reason other than they showed interest in you, lol. It takes a lot of work, honestly."

That’s when the taking space from her comes in, so that we don’t get annoyed around each other as often and have time to miss her. 

I’ve gotten to the point where I think I outgrew her, and sometimes I still do, but I love her and I always will. I do think she deserves better than me because I tend to distance myself when I feel annoyed, but I don’t know. We’ve made lots of progress so I’m hopeful. I hope you guys figure things out!"

I still get those feelings sometimes but usually it’s because I’m in a bad mood. Do you feel resentful towards her?

askwomenadvice,eskmt18,t3_c8696m,1562068889.0,"as someone with depression, I will say it’s not her responsibility to make it go away, but as your partner, she shouldn’t be putting you down for wanting time to just relax. she needs to offer more compassion & understanding. a committed relationship isnt about all the happy times only, there will be loads of grief, & your partner should /support/ you through it. Again, not save you from it, because that’s a personal battle, but calling you needy for wanting to relax is just ridiculous. 

As for yourself, what’s something you’ve always wanted to do? Any small project ideas? Passion projects? I’ve recently gotten into filmmaking, not to make money, but just to foster my creativity. It’s given me new meaning. it’s something outside of school & work I can look forward to. 

I think (and take my advice lightly, as I am only 20 with limited life experience) you should try investing in yourself more. don’t put so much into a relationship when you are struggling yourself. invest in a small project, in the gym (cliche, but — if art isn’t your thing, I’d go this route) start reading more books!! I recommend alain de bottons /How Proust Can Change Your Life/ 

I know it’s easier said than done, but I’ve struggled since I was 12, it wasn’t until I made the conscious decision to try & better myself that things started looking up for me. I used to fill the void by getting with people, but it never sustained my happiness because I was so deeply unsatisfied with myself. It was only a temporary filler. 

Therapy and meds helped me a lot. Just talking it out and having something to relieve my anxiety. I don’t know how you can fix your relationship but please do not blame yourself. It is okay to be depressed, but don’t wallow in it! Invest in a life that is yours and beautiful and not dependent on another person. Best wishes!"
