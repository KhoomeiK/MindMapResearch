What I‚Äôve been doing is just reading books around this stuff and making a conscious effort to analyze my thoughts surrounding someone, like why do I feel this way? Is it based on something valid? 

I‚Äôve also made it a point to not date until I know I can commit lol I‚Äôm upfront with everyone who tries with me, explaining that I don‚Äôt have it in me to be emotionally available because I have a lot of self worth issues and the fear of abandonment to work through.

askwomenadvice,eskmt18,t3_c8696m,1562068889.0,"as someone with depression, I will say it‚Äôs not her responsibility to make it go away, but as your partner, she shouldn‚Äôt be putting you down for wanting time to just relax. she needs to offer more compassion & understanding. a committed relationship isnt about all the happy times only, there will be loads of grief, & your partner should /support/ you through it. Again, not save you from it, because that‚Äôs a personal battle, but calling you needy for wanting to relax is just ridiculous. 

As for yourself, what‚Äôs something you‚Äôve always wanted to do? Any small project ideas? Passion projects? I‚Äôve recently gotten into filmmaking, not to make money, but just to foster my creativity. It‚Äôs given me new meaning. it‚Äôs something outside of school & work I can look forward to. 

I think (and take my advice lightly, as I am only 20 with limited life experience) you should try investing in yourself more. don‚Äôt put so much into a relationship when you are struggling yourself. invest in a small project, in the gym (cliche, but ‚Äî if art isn‚Äôt your thing, I‚Äôd go this route) start reading more books!! I recommend alain de bottons /How Proust Can Change Your Life/ 

I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but I‚Äôve struggled since I was 12, it wasn‚Äôt until I made the conscious decision to try & better myself that things started looking up for me. I used to fill the void by getting with people, but it never sustained my happiness because I was so deeply unsatisfied with myself. It was only a temporary filler. 

Therapy and meds helped me a lot. Just talking it out and having something to relieve my anxiety. I don‚Äôt know how you can fix your relationship but please do not blame yourself. It is okay to be depressed, but don‚Äôt wallow in it! Invest in a life that is yours and beautiful and not dependent on another person. Best wishes!"
