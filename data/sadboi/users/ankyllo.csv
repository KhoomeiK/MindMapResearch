HealthAnxiety,fo54qsj,t3_g5hndm,1587517472.0,"This happens to me too, I think I’m doing way better every month and then the week before my period I get bad panic attacks. So strange! 

I take evening primrose oil to try and calm my hormones but I don’t know if that works or is even possible?! Hope you find something that works for you"
HealthAnxiety,fm9w4m5,t3_ftvtm6,1585877907.0,"PS as tempting as it is, try not to check your heart rate. Over time I’ve learned that just makes you feel worse. Worrying about your rate is a rabbit hole you don’t want to let your mind go down so try to get up and do something that involves a lot of concentration to try and stop yourself from thinking about it.

For me I try to do something manual like go wash dishes, clean my room, paint my nails. Some kind of job, the more fiddly and difficult the better. Like cleaning tiles in the bathroom, cleaning old hairbrushes, cleaning jewellery, braiding threads on a pillow, counting the elements of a pattern etc. It sounds a bit random and unhelpful but personally getting lost in a task takes my mind out of the worrying cycle. 

Also if you feel really bad splash your face with cold water and keep splashing it until you feel better, it triggers some sort of response that will slow your heart rate. I’m not sure what it’s called but if you Google it you might find out more."
HealthAnxiety,fm9vc9m,t3_ftvtm6,1585877402.0,"I relate to all of this, especially the part about avoiding taking medication that you know will help incase it makes it worse somehow.

Unfortunately I’m in the same boat as you so I don’t have a magic cure to offer you but I hope it makes you feel better to know you’re not alone. 

I’m starting CBT next week and hopefully that helps but I know not everybody might be in a position to pay for therapy with all that’s going on right now. 

I’d be happy to share whatever I learn in my sessions so feel free to message me to talk any time and take care, remember you’re gonna be alright, you made it through the last panic attack and you’ll make it through the next one too, promise!"

Anxiety,fksx88b,t1_fkstvmy,1584500547.0,"Sad to hear this has happened to you but makes me feel less lonely. If it was this time last year I’d be staying inside smoking until the pandemic had blown over but lately if I smoke at all I have the worst chest pain, rapid heartbeat and dizziness. Good excuse to quit smoking but miss having the option to pass time in that way."
Anxietyhelp,fkd62qj,t3_fhrnur,1584069307.0,Yes! I’m so fed up of people asking me what brought a panic attack on when I have no idea. Just reminds me that I don’t know why this is happening and stresses me out more
relationship_advice,fjb1dh9,t1_fjaqbdt,1583184587.0,I was thinking about that story earlier today and couldn’t remember the name. This is not the context I was expecting to find it in but thank you nonetheless!
euphoria,ewfcdes,t1_etpgwef,1565357371.0,"I think the being blackmailed with your own nudes storyline is trying to highlight this case in particular and how ridiculous it was
