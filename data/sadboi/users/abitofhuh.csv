AskReddit,evi6oei,t3_cjsq0b,1564537867.0,A little late but oh well my experience was pretty recent. I hadn‚Äôt thought about the existence of ghosts or spirits for a while until this happened. It was the last day of June this year. I was laying down in my bed and a breeze came through my window. I felt a kiss on my forehead -where my hair and forehead meet exactly- and a chill ran straight through my body to my toes. When another breeze came a milder shock came through me and that was that. The next day I told my mother about what happened and she had suggested that it was her own mother who did that since a kiss on the forehead was a caring gesture and there aren‚Äôt many dead relatives who could have a close tie to me. (Funny enough though I never met my grandmother since she died two years before I was born.) I also think my mom had her mom in mind since after her mother‚Äôs death she had experienced some incidents that made her believe her mom was still around... sort of.
