Not sure if you wanted to know more about the science behind it, but here’s what I’ve learned:
So It’s actually your salivary glands (usually your parotid glands) that get enlarged after purging. Nobody knows exactly why it happens, one theory is that the gastric acid coming back up irritates the glands and another is that they are overstimulated to release extra digestive enzymes that are needed after a binge, a third theory is both."
