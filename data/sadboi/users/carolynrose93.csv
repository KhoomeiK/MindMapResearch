One only lasted a few weeks and it was fun but wasn't easy for us to coordinate the ""with benefits"" part so we just stuck with being friends since we've known each other since we were 7. The second was very fleeting, I met the guy at a Pride parade (he was a straight guy working at a male strip club) and we hooked up a couple times but that kind of fizzled out. The third was the longest but with breaks whenever one of us would get in a relationship with someone else. We were friends first and one of us would go visit the other and watch movies, drink, shoot the shit, whatever before leading to having sex. I've been in a relationship for over a year now but we still talk and hang out occasionally. 

I think my biggest rule with all of these guys is that even though I might have liked to, I NEVER dated them. It would have made things weird and I didn't want to lose them as friends if things went sour. I'm lucky in that I still talk to all three (well, two of them more than the other but we're still on good terms). None of us had any rules about keeping it a secret but if one of them had asked me to, it wouldn't have been a problem. I guess the best way to do it is find your person and have some rules in mind to discuss with them, but you also need to prepare yourself to possibly lose a friend in case one of you catches feelings or if things take a downward turn. Most importantly though is to be safe and have fun!"
