We agreed to not officially date yet and both of them know about that. It was very hard for me because I truly loved this guy yet he was pushed away by the unwelcomeness of my parents. I was hurt and I had isolated myself from everybody for a couple of months straight when we started to drift apart. We still talk here and there but only through texts.

Also with the sister thing, I'm old enough to move out on my own but it's difficult because of that. :/"
