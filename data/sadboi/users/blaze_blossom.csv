CallMeCarson,fm5nxc6,t1_fm32onx,1585776525.0,"I’m really sorry... the same thing happened to me where I was combating the worst of my depression when my bf started flirting and trying to get with other girls, and all of them were my friends... I can’t necessarily say that it gets better but I hope the best for you, the pain fades away eventually and we’re all here to support you, no matter how bad it gets."
AskReddit,fkpn9oi,t3_fjly1r,1584414232.0,"For my life to get better, and not be the abysmal mess it is right now."
AskReddit,fil5d3f,t3_f8csdm,1582493992.0,"Sometimes it’s nice to be away from people. Being around others/in an environment where everything’s always moving makes you want to slow down and relax, away from others. Being alone helps you self reflect and learn a little about yourself when you have the time to breathe, then do so."

SuicideWatch,fdc02tj,t1_fdbz3jw,1578264581.0,can I pm you?
SuicideWatch,fdbvzsu,t1_fdbuull,1578262735.0,You’re right. It is probably just my mind doing this to me. But it just feels so awful that I don’t even want to try living. It feels so difficult to get through the day without thinking that I’m so awful and horrible and that I don’t deserve to live.
SuicideWatch,fdburii,t1_fdbtc2y,1578262280.0,"I have, and they said the same thing too, but whenever I talk to my therapist, or anyone for that matter I can’t seem to really express these thoughts or feelings. I hate myself when I can’t, and when I do express them they always appear at the most inconvenient times and ruins get togethers, parties, etc."
SuicideWatch,fd5lg8l,t3_ejysqk,1578178734.0,"I feel this so much!! For the longest while I’ve been planning to die, but I always coward out or delay because I’m scared. Plus, whenever I look up methods, I just freak out at seeing the amount of pain people are expected to endure if they do them, and the likelihood that you end up surviving in the end."
AskReddit,fctmsqr,t1_fct1ezk,1577949324.0,Sounds like a description of r/TheMonkeysPaw
CasualConversation,fctmqzn,t3_eipy4z,1577949260.0,"Honestly, I did the same thing too this year. I get so stressed out over friends not responding to me and wondering if I said something wrong that I just need a break. Social media just turns into an anxiety-riddled experience, and if it's not helping you, then you don't need it. Cheers to no social media!"

CasualConversation,faku1yf,t1_fakkbcj,1576173138.0,"That’s amazing that you still have a way to bond despite the distance. My dad doesn’t like video games so we can’t really interact that way, but I’ll try calling my dad frequently like you have with your sons."
