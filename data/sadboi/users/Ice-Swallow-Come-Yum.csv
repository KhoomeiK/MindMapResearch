I try to ignore the severity of my problems as I hate comparing myself to others. My mind is always thinking the worst. I see someone who is ONLY depressed and I actually envy them. I‚Äôd kill to not have multiple illnesses. But then again, even if it is just depression you‚Äôre dealing with, everyone still struggles.

Another thought. What made her diagnose you with OCD? I have diagnosed OCD and there are many times where I just want to put a bullet through my head because the anxiety is so bad.

Not saying being a parent is some kind of an excuse to treat someone differently, but I think it‚Äôs appreciated at least by most of the community (given the amount of upvotes it has). You never know, some people might relate to her. That gives someone another person to talk to about parenting, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt see much about parenting on here. 

It opens up opportunities for others to share their concerns or whatever else they are going through. If I was a parent and I found another parent on here (especially if our children were the same age), I‚Äôd love to talk to them about what it‚Äôs like to raise children while also dealing with this illness.

I joined this sub to find people like me. To be able to put a name to what I‚Äôm going through, relate to others, find info, help others, etc. This sub should be nothing but therapeutic for everyone. And yeah it has been a shit show lately, You‚Äôre not wrong about that."

I tend to ramble a lot, but what I‚Äôm trying to say is yeah, I get what you mean, we should discuss the topic of Schizophrenia more, but letting others express how they‚Äôre feeling, whether it be happy or sad, is all a part of treatment/therapy.
