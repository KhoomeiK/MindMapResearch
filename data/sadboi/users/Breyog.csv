Encouraging less consumption of meat, and suggesting people to buy from local farms is a good start. More importantly, pressuring/advocating for politicians to localize sustainable farming and trade in your area instead of following industry standard, will do infinitely better toward combating climate change than telling individual people to just stop eating meat."

I read Elantris, Warbreaker, the Mistborn series, capped off with the Stormlight Archives, and decided to pass up trying to catch up on this heavily implied multiverse. The hype around the series all being connected was not what I cared about.

That predictability, and the Chosen-One archetype, began to tire me out.

Although writers putting up creative barriers in the episode series seem a bit contrived. Bear with me; I have three reasons why ST writers shouldn't corner themselves with the ""we already wrote that story"" problem.

One, not everyone has watched all of the ST series. TNG/DS9/VOY are great, but not everyone is going to start with that. A new ST series can reuse similar parallels for their setting. Space is huge, and there are more than one exploring vessel out there. And different perspectives can change the whole tone.

Two, revising old episode stories that may have flopped or fallen out of touch today is never, if not rarely, a bad idea. There are plenty of well written stories that have occasionally missed the mark, or was heavily revised by the incredibly shitty hands of Rick Berman. 

Three, while I am nostalgic for TNG/DS9/VOY, that doesn't mean resurrecting the same cast and crew for an identical series reboot. New characters can make similar mistakes, a new ship or crew is bound to run into similar anomalies. There are boundless opportunities to changing what happens from a previously similar sounding plot device. 

And with the addition of alternative realities, being faithful to the series own canon has always been a vague rule.

And lastly, while I love the ST universe, a new sci-fi series can still do a 'Story of the week' formula with or without the added stress of being part of a massive franchise name."

This is the tweet: ""gamergaters felt Justifiably alienated by the neoliberal fetishization of feminism and the reductionism of politics to identify teams- and powerful people with supremacy ideologies have worked a long time to subsume this alienation""

What alienation are they talking about?  

Neoliberalism and fetishization of feminism. 

To translate: capitalism, ""no-boys-allowed"", cheap non-inclusive pop-feminist bravado coming from industries (the whole "" Buy our products! We tolerate women, we painted everything pink for you! Have a pepsi for the revolution!"" Branding and outrage advertising.)

What do they mean when they say ""Reductionism of politics""?

The state at which media take incredibly neutral, reductive ""pull yourself up by your boostraps"" stances on the state of class, health insecurity, selfish-comodification and corruption that are affecting the average person- straight white men included.

Those two factors combined have made certain demographics feel alienated.

And guess who like to take advantage of that feeling of alienation? White supremacists!



All that tweet was saying is that white straight men have been affected by a form of social alienation thanks in part of capitalism and pop-feminism, and white supremacists decided to latch on to this idea that their way if life is under attack by women- specifically women justifiably criticizing video games and media.

GamerGhazi,fftekni,t3_ev402s,1580218267.0,"I know John K is popular for the initial design of the show, but we really do give this scab of a man too much credit. 

John K worked on one season. He was terrible at getting work done, was difficult to work with, and the show would have been canned if Bob Camp hadn't stepped in as director.

If you want to feel morally satisfied about watching the series, watch it knowing John K was so bad at managing his own show that he had to be replaced.

Bob Camp had a greater hand in making that show as long lasting as it was.  There you go."

wow,feyvzpn,t3_eqx87t,1579451120.0,"My thoughts on BFA;

- WQs were fine.
- emissary rewards quickly became redundant.
- azerite gear talent weights became a game of adding awkward talent trees with unbalanced talents depending on your class/spec, mixed with RNG. You could get a ilvl 445 chest with talents that parses 2k dps less than your 415 chest with the most optimal talents for you spec. 
- Now we have corruption to replace WF and TF RNG. While more narratively involved, the corruption values are already swinging wildly from gear to gear.
- Mythics+ gear quickly made other content obsolete. Players that got it, don't play it again.
- at least legion awarded AP in older raids. Even had raid WQs to do. In BFA, finding a single raid pug for Uldir/BoD/ or that one mini raid we can barely remember, is scarce.
- Items of currency/mats kept getting added, making older mats obsolete. 
- crafting professions are consistently beat out by mythics + gear. 
- Battle scared augmentation ruin would be nice as a material sink for inscription. Instead the item is only accessible if you pug alone in dungeons as a tank or healer, or run LFRs. 
- island expeditions feels like a mini game with no  major importance to story or narrative. Probably would have been better introduced as a pvp scenario only.
- Warfronts are a mess.
- Essences feel like an attempt to fix the azerite gear.  
- the grind for essences make the idea of playing on Alts a nightmare, despite this expansion being the expansion with the most new races added.

Despite that, I still play for the social aspects of the game.

Would be nice if Blizz added Reputation tabards for players that were late to start the game. I know too many people that look at the Reputation thresholds and just give up on unlocking the allied races that they wanted. : /"
technology,feoqmqe,t1_feoje4d,1579304071.0,"Read the article and point out where it is directly accusing republicans for spreading misinformation.

Don't get me wrong, democrats, especially establishment neoliberal brand of democrats are just as likely to stoop to misinformation when it profits them, including climate change denial. No one has denied that.

 What you did, however, was try to change the subject from ""we have a problem with rich oligarchs paying to supply misinformation on extremely prescient science of climate change"" to "" Buh Democrats do it too!!!""

Stop that. You're obfuscating."
technology,feohn7r,t1_feo8mun,1579300334.0,"Funny how an article that doesnt mention any party affiliated to the misinformation, and a magawumbus screeches in to 'whatabout dah blue peepole' a subject expressly talking about misinformation on climate change, not party affiliation."

pointlesslygendered,fe0ejat,t3_enjsha,1578811919.0,"The game is a parody. And changes rules to give female players extra benefits in the game itself. It was intended to make people upset with the intentional unfair rules. 

I'm of the opinion it's counterproductive and stinks of shallow pop-feminism, intending to be ambiguous and flimsy enough that it would provoke outrage just for the purpose of selling brand attention.

Monopoly did the same outrage branding like the hilariously full-circle Monopoly socialism edition where the rules are so broken with strawman arguements that villifies any and all form of social assistance, public education, municipalities and public healthcare with healthy doses of good old american red scare tactics, despite the game's origins being inspired originaly as a criticism of capitalism.

TheMagnusArchives,fds8eed,t3_ekshnl,1578696694.0,"I'd switch the strength saving throw to a wisdom saving throw with the ability Terminal Velocity. And add a 1d4 or 1d6 for turns spent locked in the spell's effect before its conclusion when in combat.  Otherwise, that 6th lvl spell would ultimately remove a target from combat indefinitely on success.  Pretty sweet, but maybe a little OP for a 6th lvl ability.  Very nice build though.

Do you plan on building patrons of each entity?"
