relationships,fqfg70t,t3_gidtyf,1589324314.0,"It's sad it has to be this way, but she is devastated, grieving, angry, sad, confused.... so young too.... and you are the only people she can safely express these feeling around. People who she knows she has an unbreakable bond with. Its so tough on you guys, but if she couldn't go through all these emotions with you, who could she? She loves you, and she would be lost without you, she's just lost in a haze of trauma. Just be there and love her, be patient. 

But you guys need to take care of yourselves too, if you are going to absorb her pain, you need an outlet, whether that's talking with friends, therapy, or just taking the time for self care. If you feel like there's not much you can do, how about looking at what you can do for your mom or other people in the family to support them so they can continue to support her?

Is there things you can do to lighten your mom's load? That will in turn make you feel better if you feel like you are doing something positive to help.

I wish you all the best of luck and especially your little sister."

I have to think carefully about what I say and how I say it. I'll only do it face to face, and even that might be tricky because I cant see a scenario where we will be alone for long enough. 

I just want him to know that that it was because of what is wrong with me that I couldn't do it and he is wonderful and I'd be lucky to have him and that I do want him.

Friends getting involved is the worst. Don't tell her anything else. Another of my friends, who is friends with he and I, was way too involved in the whole situation. I wish it had just been me and him, no outside influences. 

This is the last time I allow anyone that much insider knowledge about my private life."
love,fo3w6zc,t1_fo3h9r4,1587493974.0,"No. She has no idea anything ever went on between us. They had previously dated over a year before anything happened (I think for just a few months) between me and him. She broke up with him and dated other people. He remained single... until me. 

I didn't know her well at all at that point, we have become friends after that. I didn't know him all that well either, we all got closer post their relationship, so for me it was almost like that hadn't happened. 

Anyway, just as we were initially exploring our relationship, she started hinting she liked him again, although she was in another relationship. That was one of the things that made it hard for me to fully lean into it. 

It's a mess huh? 

They've gone from zero to 100 pretty quick this time round, I don't think it was that serious when they dated before. She has been saying he's the love of her life. 

One thing that has hurt me is that he has not acknowledged their relationship to me at all. I wonder how he thought I would find out? Luckily I got the heads up from someone else first or it would have been a case of seeing them together an realising at a social event or something. He still never mentions her to me.

Omg it's like all the lights come back on in my brain when we start having a conversation, but I doubt it's the same from his end. He is living with his girlfriend so spending a few minutes here and there texting me probably doesn't register that much. Also he's so popular, pretty much everyone thinks he is their best friend so he's probably talking to loads of people.

I can't complain though, it was me who put the stoppers on it. I'm a very slow mover, I have reasons, that I wish I could explain to him, but there is no point now.

I had to pick him up the other day because he fell over, because he was tired and out of breath.

Still, I did take him out the other day, but he suddenly needed the toilet and as we were heading back a gang of teenage boys came towards us and tried to cough at us, laughing . SO, that was quite upsetting and neither of us want to repeat the experience to be honest. 

We have a garden though and he's been out tending to it when he's had the energy, or just sitting out on the bench.

Yeah the downplaying is quite chronic really, I need to inform the health service that he's suffering more than he's probably admitted to. 

I rang up yesterday, no answer, so I left a message and haven't heard back yet. I really does feel like we've been completely abandoned at the moment. 


It's hard not to be angry, he's paid into the NHS his whole life, and now he's being abandoned when he needs it, in favour of people such as those horrible little bastards we encountered.

It's all a bit of a mess really. 

I will call a few of the numbers they gave us today and ask about hospice care. I was wondering about anti depressants, also sleeping aids. We asked while he was receiving his treatment about sleeping aids and they said no, I presume because it might not go well with the chemo, but now they've stopped that so no reason to deny him that. 

I feel a lot better now I've got a bit more of a clue what can be done, I hope they can do for my dad what they did for yours, thank you for your insight and taking the time out to reply to me, means a lot :)"

Then get Musashi to put OG Dolores pearl into ERW body and copy pearl into Hale body? 

Unless it is a new Hale body because to get the pearl out she had to damage the old one?

Lmao I'm tying myself in knots here!

Then later on a guess she made security guard bot and used a pearl on him. Not sure at what point she made Bernard. I think this leaves one more pearl unaccounted for, so there's another reveal to be had.

If someone came and 'saved' me now, but actually they didn't really want to be there and them being with me was causing them distress, I think I'd wish they could tell me. They'd have to be gentle, transparent, and I'd want to feel like I could still talk to them afterwards and maybe they could still be a source of support... but I wouldn't want them to stay with me.

 If I found out they had felt that way for a loooong time and had been scared to say anything, I would feel even worse than I already did, for causing them to do that, and for feeling like I'd been lied to.

All I can say is, sometimes you've got to accept that it's not going to happen at the rate you want it to. Sometimes it's good to take a break from that thing you're working towards and try something else. 

I find I have to make changes to the way I practice just to edge it along a little bit. So I might practice with a metronome for a bit, then without, then with my eyes shut, then just strumming, then just fretting. Some days I'll feel like I've gotten worse! But on the whole the improvement is there, it's just a winding road!

Weirdly, once I started trying to sing and play at once, although together they are incredibly hard and I had to back track to simpler songs at first, sometimes I'd get into a flow where I'd be putting so much energy into the singing (more just saying the words if im honest!) that my muscle memory or whatever for playing, would kick in better than if I was just concentrating on the playing.

I am struggling so I can't imagine how hard this is for you. Sending you lots of love."

westworld,flxekto,t3_frij18,1585581326.0,"My problem with the Angela theory, is that Angela was never a fully rounded character, she was just.... there. If it was... I don't see why it wouldn't be revealed already, it wouldn't warrant this level of build up and mystery surrounding the identity."

westworld,flxbfk1,t1_flwlzt0,1585579506.0,"Not sure I'm on board with the theory, but these definitely would not be considered insignificant details, they are important continuity details. The only other explanation to me could be a scene got cut that explains the change in hair/clothes and absence of bag/gun. I'm not the most observant but even I noticed the hair and thought it was funny she'd sit there doing her hair like that before she went back out!"

relationship_advice,flx3n6u,t3_frntmf,1585574261.0,"I think it would be lovely for her to have all of you, the family friends family and you. Someone mentioned finding out about other adopted kids in this situation and how they feel about it, you should definitely look into that. I think you also need to find out how much the other family will allow you to be in her life, if you can be a part of the family too. You can't hide this from her. It's impossible and when the truth came out it would be ten times worse because she was lied to. If she is told the truth, she will always feel secure. You don't have to choose, you can have both. You can't stop her feeling pain, she will feel pain in her life, in fact the earlier you are familiar with pain, the better. It doesn't mean you can't be happy. And she will be, because she's got the best big brother in the world. Look after yourself."
