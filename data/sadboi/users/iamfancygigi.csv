Your parents saved up enough and managed their money well enough to have a really nice/luxurious retirement or living situation. They should not have to sacrifice what they earned because of your mistakes. If they are kind and willing they might but they dont owe you shiiiit

What the hell is wrong with you? You are going to jeopardise your daughters entire future because of 1 rude comment? Do you love your daughter? Do you prioritise your gf over your daughter? She lost her mother. It has only been a year and you have already replaced her. How can you expect her to act as if its all good? You almost make it seem like your wife didnt mean that much to you, or you just move on very fast. Much faster than your daughter. You should take her feelings into consideration, maybe she isnt ready to have a new mum and it hurts her deeply when you shove ur new gf in her face."
