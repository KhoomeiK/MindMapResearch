However, I‚Äôm also a raging alcoholic/addict and cant seem to take any abusable medication without severe consequences, and my psychiatrist won‚Äôt prescribe anything of the likes.
So, these little tips & suggestions are very helpful and they mean a lot to me, as I‚Äôm figuring out how to treat my ADHD without meds. So thank you."

They‚Äôre gonna ask you about your past, your history, any negative patterns like eating disorders, substance abuse history etc.
They‚Äôre probably gonna ask you to explain what your symptoms are and how they manifest in your every day life. 

The most important thing to remember is, be honest and try to let them in as much as possible. This will give the professional enough information to provide an accurate diagnosis. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è"
