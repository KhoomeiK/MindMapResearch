The whole family laughs. I spend all night puking. When I don't find it amusing, she finds a way to put on a big show and go spend the night at HER mother's and play the victim. No one cared that she poisoned me, it was a revenge joke. So funny.

Turns out he had been paying double rent and she was using it to fuel her wedding. We had 1 conversation (our first), and it led to both of us dropping contact with her and dating.

No one WANTS bipolar disorder. It seems natural to want to deny it and fight against it. 

I am learning that I definitely go longer between manic episodes with medication. I am learning that I sleep better and more regularly if I don't have caffeine in my diet at all. I am learning to accept and cope with my bipolar disorder. 

If you really feel that you don't have the correct diagnosis, talk to your Drs about it. Ask them what makes them feel that you have it. Talk to a therapist about it and see if you can figure out if it's the right diagnosis for you."

Your trauma, without diminishing it, isn't everyone else's trauma. Your triggers aren't theirs. The way you heal won't heal them. 

Yes, coping skills are important for everyone. Therapy is important for everyone with bipolar, but that doesn't make medication a ""cast"". 

Trauma, especially at an early age, actually changes the way a person's brain develops. It affects the chemistry of the brain. For some of us, medication will be a lifelong part of our journey regardless of our amount of meditation and vitamins.

I hope your path continues smoothly. I hope nothing horrible happens to set you back. Unfortunately, that isn't the same for everyone. I did great for years before my youngest was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder and the trauma of that put me back to square one. Then I did great for months until one of the most important people in my world died. 

Some of us, no matter how many coping mechanisms we try, do not cope well with trauma. Some of us will need more than diet and excersizes to manage. My medications are definitely not a cast the will be taken off when I heal. They are more like a permanent brace to help support me and make it easier to get back on track when I fall."

At that time, I gave them 1/2 of each check for rent, paid them for my phone on their plan, and bought groceries for myself and my son. I also cleaned the entire house, did all of the laundry(including my younger brothers), all of the cooking, and all of the grocery shopping. If I slacked on any of them or didn't do them timely, I faced severe emotional abuse.

I sat my parents down to discuss me moving out 2 weeks prior. I had already made a down payment on my new place and had my utilities and all lined up. They LOST It! Had my phone(which I paid for) in the middle of the night that night, said terrible things to me in front of my son, and tried to call and get me fired from work so I wouldn't have income.

The next day, when it was obvious they couldn't keep me from going, they told me that I was a terrible mother and I needed to leave my son with them. Of course I didn't. They kicked me out that day. My son and I had to sleep on friends couches for two weeks until I could move into the new place. It took years to get my son, then two years old, to stop speaking disrespectfully to me because that's all he had ever known.

My point is, if you are giving them warning, have a back up plan and be ready for whatever reaction they might have. Regardless, don't let them keep you from getting out!"

I did what I was taught, I ran and told. They sent the older boy away(our family was fostering him) but they told me they didn't believe me and treated me like trash my whole life. 

It took a therapist making me understand that they would never give me validation, and that I truly didn't need it. I now have no contact with that toxicity."

raisedbynarcissists,fel8tuy,t3_epnec9,1579216565.0,"I legit get jealous of my own children. My mother treats them completely different and they gush and just love her. I don't have it in me to ruin their childhoods with my abuse stories or telling them that the things they love so much about her are fake and would crumble if they stopped getting her the hero-worship praise she craves. I mean, how do you tell children that their nana is the reason you still apologize for sneezing and are terrified of disapproval? And I hate that, even as an adult knowing that she is a terrible person, I am still jealous of them and wish she gave me positive attention."

Sneakers, boots(I love the woods), and one pair of black heels for weddings and what not. Why do girls have shoes for every outfit or heels of all colors? I don't get it!"
