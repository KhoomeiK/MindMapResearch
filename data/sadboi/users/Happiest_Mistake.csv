I'll try to be more careful with what I post next time. And thank you."
raisedbynarcissists,faq7l05,t1_faq5ziu,1576299059.0,"That's the thing. I don't know how to tell him how I feel without hurting his feelings. He's kinda sensitive and it feels like I've been leading him on these past months. Now I feel guilty about it and could even lose our friendship altogether.

Tbh I'm not even sure anymore whether I do like him as a friend or more than that."

teenagers,f9w0zm1,t3_cytkot,1575685087.0,"This was posted 3 months ago, and I found this just now. Lol. I love writing, it's grueling yet fun... In a way... But despite filling in almost three notebooks and writing hundreds of drafts and chapter ones that are currently rotting away in my hard drive, USB or Google docs, posting a couple books online then later removing them cause I felt like it was shit (which it really was), I am proud to say that I have not finished a single book.

I get an idea, get all excited, then after a couple days the excitement and motivation dies down and I eventually get a new idea and abandon the one I was working on.

30 more unfinished Chapter Ones and drafts later, I get all depressed and pissed that I haven't finished a single. Damn. Story. In the past three years of writing. 

Yeah, this is fun. :,)"

Every now and then when I look at the mirror I would either say ""I'm so ugly."", or I'd be like ""Wow, looking good today."""
