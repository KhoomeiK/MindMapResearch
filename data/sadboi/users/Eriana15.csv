I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre in the low 20‚Äôs for BF. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend bulking at this point since you likely have no access to heavy gym weights. I would do a recomp and definitely bump up your protein intake. I‚Äôm a tall girl too who‚Äôs naturally skinny (5‚Äô10 160 lbs) and I eat about 160 g of protein a day and didn‚Äôt see much of an increase in muscle mass till I really dialed in my protein.
