suggestmeabook,eyuu9hl,t1_eyuqwu1,1567472307.0,"Well, two books come immediately to mind that I found inspiring. One book was the autobiography of John H Johnson the publisher of Ebony, Jet, and other magazines. I read his book years ago but his story has stuck with me.  He tackled enormous challenges and achieved his goals.  I liked his philosophy of “Do you what you can, with what you have, to get what you want.”   Once he defined what he wanted he could cobble together the means of achieving it.   

Another book I found very meaningful to me was a biography of Freya Stark who despite a world of obstacles became, among other things, a world famous explorer, and writer all because she defined what she wanted and went for it.  This book was Passionate Nomad: The Life of Freya Stark by Jane Fletcher Geniesse. It reads like an exciting novel.  What I took from Stark’s life was an appreciation for cultivating a habit of resilience in the face of naysayers and doubters.  

You can, and will, get out of the rut you feel you’re in. I say that because you’re asking the right questions and looking for answers to speed your journey up and out, stick with it you’ll get there."
