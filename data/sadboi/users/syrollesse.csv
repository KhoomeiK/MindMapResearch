He might not be cheating but there's something else that's going on and you need to be honest with him about how you feel. If you're incompatible then nothing will change that unless you're willing to sacrifice parts of yourself which you shouldn't have to do in a relationship. When it comes to love language, people can learn it, its a question of whether he's willing to fight for you or if he just doesn't care. Sometimes it's better to end things than live in paranoia and work on yourself and your own problems first. I have mental health issues and I won't be getting into a relationship any time soon because I know that it will sabotage it because of how closed off I am. You don't have to be in relationships your whole life, you need to take time for yourself and figure things out.
