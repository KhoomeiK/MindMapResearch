VUcirclejerk,fqmzmev,t3_gjqudu,1589486186.0,"[Verse 13 Left: Morrison]
Sick leaf and sorrow and pincers not scissors
Regard and refrain from the daughters of marriage
Regards for the elders and youngest in carriage
Regard and regard for the inverse and perverse
And obverse, and diverse, of reverse and reverse
Regard from the sick, the dumb, and the camel
From pump's storing water, like brain is to marrow
X-ray and filthy and cutting and then peeling
To skin and to skin and to bone and to structure
To livid and pallid and turgid and structured
And structured and structured and structured and structured
And regard and refrain, and regard and refrain
The sick and the dumb, inverse, reverse and perverse
[Verse 13 Right: Reed]
Contempt, contempt, and contempt for the seething
For writhing and reeling and two-bit reportage
For sick with the body and sinister holy
The drown burst blue babies now dead on the seashore
The valorous horseman, who hang from the ceiling
The pig on the carpet, the dusty pale jissom
That has no effect for the sick with the see-saw
The inverse, obverse, converse, reverse of inverse
The diverse and converse of reverse and perverse
And sweet pyrotechnics, and let's have another
Of inverse, converse, diverse, perverse and reverse
Hell's graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains
The slick and the scum, reverse, inverse and perverse"

I had time on my hands (we all do) and I decided to recreate every season's title card replacing ""Seinfeld"" with ""Vampire Weekend."" I'm hosting the files (.psd/.png) on my [github](https://github.com/lemontwig/SeinfeldxVampireWeekend).
