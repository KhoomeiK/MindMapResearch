* I haven't yet done any of the engineering. I haven't 'picked a faction' yet either and I'm not really sure which way I should go about this. Of course that means I have standard jump range on everything.
* I've set a goal to align to a faction - I don't know how to do this, or what benefit it gives me

* I'd like to go thargoid hunting at some point
