2. No. The British Empire and French Empire is the reason for wide democracy in the world. 

Japan, kind of, but the UK was also very useful against the Japanese in WW2 and the Post-WW2 government of Japan was based almost entirely on the British government. 

Philippines, yes the US is responsible for that, I won’t argue with you on that one 

Canada, no. Canada has been part of the British Empire for 200 years when it became independent, the US had nothing to do with Canadian freedom

Look at the British Empire. Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Guyana, America, Canada, Ireland. All of them were previously under British rule and they are all democratic countries (excluding Hong Kong but that’s only because China invaded)
