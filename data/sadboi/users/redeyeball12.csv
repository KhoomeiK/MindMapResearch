SuicideWatch,extaghq,t3_cubxv2,1566565355.0,"They do care. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t care if you died. We take people for granted, we assume our loved ones are doing better than us. Sometimes you don’t know what you have until there’s a risk you could lose it. I had this realization after my friend tried to commit suicide for the first time. It was then, that I realized I could could lose her forever, and that no one is guaranteed tomorrow. If someone cares about you wanting to die, it means they care about keeping you alive."

I really wanted to see the best in him, but at a certain point I realized he didn’t even know or care about how much he hurt me. Cutting him out my life was really really hard. I felt a lot of guilt and shame, and I still flinch when people touch me (especially men). I know it was the right choice, but sometimes I think about him and how I so badly wish to go back to before it happened. I don’t wish him pain though, he has his own issues. I just wish he apologized or something; but he genuinely doesn’t think he did anything wrong. Maybe that’s for the better idk"

I think I might have had some sort of from of body dysmorphia, because when I look back at old pictures of me I look completely normal; when at the time I couldn’t even look at myself in a mirror. It grew from my body and face, to my personality. I overanalyzed everything anyone said to me. I couldn’t differentiate between what I thought of myself and what others thought of me.
