CPTSD,fpyo1ga,t1_fpx8eli,1589006965.0,"Thank you so much for your wonderful and very thoughtful reply. And you hit the nail on the head, this is the first major setback I‚Äôve had in my recovery. Two and a half years ago I was finally ok enough (and frankly pissed off at the cycle enough) to seek help, and it‚Äôs pretty much been getting better ever since. Even though it was extremely difficult, I could always see the progress that I had made. And then when I got that 4.0...it was all I have ever wanted. So I think I just kind of thought ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it! I‚Äôm finally free of CPTSD!! I can now succeed with no more major hurdles!‚Äù. I know that that sounds so naive but I just want to be done with this chapter of my life so badly. I‚Äôm in my late twenties too, and there‚Äôs definitely a big part of me that is bitterly resentful of my CPTSD. Idk if this is how it is for everyone, but for me when my trauma surfaced, it was like the dam broke. I didn‚Äôt sleep through the night afterwards for years, and it took so long to just be able to fully function again. By the time I got into treatment it had been 6 years of this tedious, scary, isolating  battle. And then there was even *more* work to do when I did EMDR. And *more* work in CBT. So when I finally started really succeeding and finally seeing the fruits of my hard labor, it felt like I could finally breathe easier. Like I was finally ok again. I have a wonderful partner that I want to build a life with, and I wish I could just do it already. I want to move on. Maybe that‚Äôs why this setback has been so hard...it‚Äôs evidence that I‚Äôm not done with this chapter just yet. 

Sorry for the crazy long reply, clearly I needed to get this out lol. Thank you for listening."

For example, I will often have Word, One Note, Outlook, iTunes, and the Notes app running at the same time. Having a nice keyboard is important to me, since I type quite a lot. I would also like to be able to organize files easily/efficiently.

We had heard on the news about people being crazy and hoarding toilet paper and hand sanitizer, but it was just really surreal to see it in person at our local grocery store. I guess I assumed that the stories on the news were the outliers, that most people would think of people besides themselves and not buy so much that everyone else would be screwed. But clearly that‚Äôs not what happened. 

Entire aisles were empty. There was literally no meat, and *a lot* of other things were completely gone too. We couldn‚Äôt buy half of what was on our list.
