From my perspective. I appreciate him keeping is prospering while I'm dropping the ball. I feel like I'm not being the wife he deserves. I feel even more like a failure and it's an endless cycle.

My advice is to take her to a doctor and get her treated for the depression. There might be an underlying health problem. Therapy is good, I would like to go soon. It's in my plan.

In my dream I had woken up and spoken to my husband about how we shared the same weird dream. Tiger walking through the fog of a street I know well. Sitting In the truck driving around arguing with my mom. 
Anyways, really felt awake for a moment. And I felt my cat in my armpit. I looked over and it's not allie(my cat). Its my mom's corpse and its looking at me. I can't move. It starts to lay up and get closer. I can't wake up. I close my eyes. I'm convinced it's some nasty visitor turning my dreams rotten. I start telling it ""fuck you! I know you're not my mom!"" Its touch me. I'm screaming ""fuck you! Get away from me! Fuck you, fuck you"". My eyes closed tight and its touching my face trying to tease me into opening my eyes. Still yelling out fuck you. I knew I was asleep but I needed to wake up and I couldn't. 

Then suddenly my husband was shaking me awake. I was yelling out in my sleep clearly and he woke up. I'm free. I look over and allie is in my armpit. She's concerned. I nuzzle her as my heart is pounding. 

Earlier that night at 3 am my husband woke up in a fit of coughing. Like he was choking. He says he doesn't remember what the dream was. Later on that dream happened to me at like 4/430am. 

It was heart pounding and scary. It was Christmas eve. The whole night just felt aweful. We were tired the next day."
