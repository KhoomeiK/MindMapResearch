BPD,f0pz0q9,t3_d5sm7h,1568850728.0,"You’ll get out of this. I’ve gone through this as well. I’m kind of going through a less intense version of this now. Everything is temporary. Try to spend time focusing on self care and things that make you feel good about yourself inside and out. 

This too shall pass."

Rateme,f0gvrnq,t3_d4srx2,1568607229.0,Top right picture is my fave. You’re beautiful. Are those the photos you use on tinder?

BPD,f08u0pl,t3_d3yzqi,1568487947.0,"I definitely used to be like this. As time has gone by, and I’ve done lots of MDMA, I don’t struggle with it anymore. I still don’t really feel comfortable with kissing sometimes though. For me, kissing feels more intimate than actual sexual acts. Is that weird? Yes. Is that linked to trauma? Probably. Okay, tangent over."

BPD,f00aba7,t1_ezzmce9,1568299306.0,"Always sleeping over at someone’s house because I hate being by myself, and when I’m alone I’m frantically trying to make plans to be with people."

littlespace,ez7ags8,t3_d04wdb,1567720997.0,Awe. I love that. Nice work.
BPD,ez79t2r,t3_czwcod,1567720764.0,"Yesterday a friend was telling me that they don’t know how I can stay out all the time and that they’d miss their bed. I literally don’t ever feel like I’m in my own space/feel comfort in my own bed any more than someone else’s. I’m away at university now and sometimes think “I want to go home,” but when I’m home I think the same thing. I didn’t really realize this was a bpd thing."
BPD,ez78wrs,t3_d02fa1,1567720436.0,"I don’t feel like it has made me “dumber,” but it has resulted in university being more difficult for me than I wish it would be. I struggle to focus/pay attention to detail, it’s hard for me to realize something is going to make me late, the stress can lead to dissociative symptoms... it’s hard for me to put into perspective that things are temporary. I’m a Music Performance major and I have a placement audition tomorrow. I don’t know if I’m filled with anxiety or if I don’t give a fuck."
