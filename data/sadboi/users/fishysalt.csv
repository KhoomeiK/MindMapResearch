Debate,fp7103v,t1_fp6wbuc,1588362085.0,Lmfaoo I am a super small school and do policy. Policy has more small schools because it is a uil sanctioned event.
Debate,fosump0,t1_fosb3k7,1588038388.0,Bruh that’s my whole argument if policy and even ld kids can manage this type of argumentation then y’all should be able to as well. You seem to have this belief that it’s just too hard to do or learn. That’s not true at all. You can be incredibly uncommitted and actually fair better with kritiks then case arguments. This whole of trying to stay in the dark ages is really harmful to the other events perception of yall. You really put here underselling pf and saying we all dumb and can’t keep up with new debate ideas.
Debate,fos8le2,t3_g94oit,1588025948.0,I don’t understand why pf kids are unable to learn progressive arguments. If policy kids can do it why can’t y’all. Pf debaters who view progressive arguments as too intense and difficult are admitting to being inadequate and unable to learn.
Debate,fopj9ns,t3_g8tc6y,1587962957.0,"I agree whole heartedly. I am from a small school and have been fairly successful in policy and I do not understand the extreme fear of progressive pf. People once said the same about policy and ld, both of those events now have progressive and traditional routes available. Theory and kritik all arguments are easily accessible through open evidence and super simple to learn the basics. Once the basics are learned any k is the same thing as you mentions just like theory. I believe the fear that the pf community has is unfounded yet understandable. If a small school can survive policy then pf can modify as well. Not to mention the smallest school can’t compete pf because uil does not sanction that event so the population most concern is being expressed for is not going to be impacted regardless."

policydebate,fny4t53,t1_fny3klm,1587353417.0,I think you misunderstood a crucial argument I was making I believe that evidence like this is allowing debaters to think critically on how they can utilize seeming random ideas and create a cohesive policy argument. I am not advocating for a free lanced political discussion rather a method of providing interesting articles that are outside of the box and letting the users of this reddit discover debate uses. For example this post can be used for a numerous amount of arguments that you didn’t predict. This shows growth of the research pool as well as the potential for debates to leave open evidence arguments behind and have some more advanced level debates.

I understand the concern yet also believe that this subreddit can morph and evolve into what the community desires. Let upvotes and downvotes be the judge of what should and shouldn’t be on this sub. The rules increase mod intervention and decrease free thinking. This post and comment thread let me think critically of ways this evidence could be used for debate a skill useful in policy. So by relying on rules of the sub to govern what can and can’t be shared censorship will increase, the education available will decrease and ultimately could hurt potential debate arguments. This is because of the lack of variety in posts. Ignore the individual posts intent and focus in the potential for these harms to occur."

I think you would be better off finding evidence that discusses how the weed legal states still experience the problem and find a way to apply this to the whole nation. But this might be difficult since the majority of the evidence will be saying that the states almost need to form a union to completely destroy the cartels market thus being inherent and solvent. The first part of your post makes zero sense. Food can still be illegal. Many types of fermented fish are banned from the usa. Customs can still destroy food products.

Debate has allowed me to advocate on behalf of my other lgbtq+ members to an outright homophobic school board (currently the subject of national news and the subject of an aclu court case). Debate in all of its forms I do cx but can hold my own in just about any form of it, has really taught me useful skills for the rest of my life. However there is a dark side to the debate world, from the capitalistic structure to the dirty methods used to secure a victory. Yet even those have taught me so much. I now know that if I am poor I am condemned to lose in politics and that politics is a dirty game. My largest problem is the amount of advantage large schools have. Camp should be free/covered by schools. My partner have not been able to go to camp  and feels the toll that has had on her debate skills. The good news is that even with significant social disadvantages being a team made of daca recipients, sexual minorities, gender queer, and coming from every socioeconomic status we can all compete in an activity that challenges us."
