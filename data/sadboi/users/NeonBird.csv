When I visit them, I’ll abide by their rules (no smoking, no pets, no visitors, etc), but I’ll also make it clear that I’m an adult. I’ll come and go as I please while still being respectful of their schedules (no coming in late at night and waking them up, pitch in with chores, and communicate with them anything that is out of the norm).

You’re young and you want to assert your independence and that’s normal. I would simply start doing things like, sit down with them and have a rational conversation about your needs and establish boundaries and general expectations with the understanding that you will need to keep up your end of the bargain and follow through with what you say. If anyone deviates, just agree that you will give each other friendly reminders. 

If that doesn’t work, consider finding a roommate and moving out."

careerguidance,fq44e9x,t3_ggfh2t,1589073521.0,"Keep in mind that some bachelors degrees are not designed to stand on their own and are really stepping stones into higher level degrees. For example, the psychology degree is designed to give you the foundational knowledge to do well in a masters program where you get into more specialized lines of psychology. English and pre-law degrees are often stepping stones into law school. STEM degrees usually give you the ability to work in a lab as a research assistant and nothing more. If you really want to move up in those fields, you have to be willing to get a masters and get into a specialized area. 

However, there are some degrees that allow you to get a decent paying job out of college depending on the field you want to get into. For example, Agribusiness will get you an accounting position either in agri companies, working at banks where you specialize in agri loans, or even being a supervisor in a poultry processing plant. They all pay decent, but it really depends on what you want to do and the type of work you’re willing to do."

Go to your supervisor directly and request a one on one meeting to discuss the issue. If it’s not resolved, go to HR. It might not be harassment, but it might fall under micro aggressions.  They might also look into the weird promotion/hiring situation and you could request their reasoning on why they rescinded their initial offer for said position. The hiring committee would have to document that and HR has to keep it on file in case a candidate challenges the decision to not be hired. 

Document your conversations including dates, parties involved, and topics discussed and resolutions if any. If you have emails, hang on to those. Since they were sent using your university’s email domain, they’re fair game. 

As bad as the situation is, now is not a good time to jump ship unless you have a definite secure position lined up elsewhere either at your current institution or elsewhere given how COVID-19 is forcing IHEs to cut ancillary services that are not essential to the university mission.

I want to work for an organization where I can get some upward movement in my career and not stagnate at the bottom because of structural oddities that are not typical for this field. 

I feel like these changes can be made by working for a larger institution that has a stand-alone office specific to what I do that has a robust staff with genuine opportunities for growth and advancement within the department and organization.

When I started this position, the program I was placed in charge of was a dumpster fire at best. In two years, I increased the enrollment by 55%, the overall satisfaction of program participants, and I have solid evidence that the program is achieving desired outcomes. This came at the expense of me working 12-18 hours a day to regain the trust of participants and stakeholders who had been failed by the program’s previous coordinator.

I just want to be acknowledged, not micromanaged and  not passed over for upward movement. I don’t want to just hear my boss say that I’m appreciated and then continue to minimize me and my demonstrated achievements, which sends the message that they’re insincere and probably just want to keep me around knowing that I’ll do the grunt work. But I’m bored with the grunt work and want more opportunities. I have asked for such since I hit my two year mark here and have been denied every time.  

I’m at a point in my career where I should be seeing some kind of upward movement, even if it’s just a small title and small pay bump. Most peers at other institutions get some kind of promotion after 2.5 years in; I get nothing despite my efforts to do well.

Even though I’m sad when I realize they don’t feel the same towards me, I can easily just move on with the understanding that I’m going to feel really lonely for a while until the next friend comes along. The last friendship I got really close to fell apart after they tried to throw me under the bus to cover up their mistake and stirred up a lot of unnecessary drama.  I just dropped that friend dead cold without any explanation as I knew it would drain me of energy to further engage with them. 

I just keep to myself mostly even though I wish I had someone to connect to. I find that I’m slowly turning into a workaholic hermit."

lonely,fhz6bev,t3_f5cu8v,1581991864.0,"Oh, I have always been the disposable “friend.” The first to get ditched or asked to leave. I’ve always wanted to find my “tribe,” but at 36, it just seems like I’ll never know what it’s like to have a group that I feel like I’m genuinely a part of and welcomed as one of their own. 

Right now, I have one person I’ve been hanging with regularly, but I know it’s a matter of time before they move on."

careerguidance,fhtfmtr,t3_f4s4j6,1581873951.0,"If you want to stay in academia, try applying at smaller universities, but be very aware that the application process can be brutal. In the meantime, try finding some MOOCS where you can begin to learn the skills that you lack and try getting industry certification wherever possible. This way, you will have both theoretical knowledge as well as applied knowledge. 

If you want to get out of academia, try applying at places like Ball or other industries where your knowledge can get you in the door. Right now, renewables are hot and you better get in now wherever you can. This may be way more feasible in India than in North America where India is running out of energy to support the population in certain regions. 

As for your art and relationships, those may have to be put on hold for now until you can get stable again to where you have the time, money, and energy to address these areas of your life. It’s kind of hard to date and practice your art when you’re broke and have very few prospects. Once you get stable again, try joining clubs that allow you to practice or share your art with others and get in the habit of attending professional conferences and seminars within your field to network."

Colorado,fhksczd,t1_fhkri9x,1581690357.0,"The MEM program is a interdisciplinary program with an emphasis on energy and resource management. The students work with local businesses and government to take on projects that measure the impact of business on the local environment and how that impact affects local populations. It’s a popular program. We’ve made a the news a few times for our MEM program, but nothing that’s going to headline the New York Times because Western is so small and remote."
