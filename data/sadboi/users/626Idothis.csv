I really don’t think the konmari method works well for true hoarders, it’s way deeper than “sparks joy” or nah.  But thinking about does this “stress me or make me anxious in a negative way?” may really be a better approach or at least a starting point. Sometimes it’s easier to know what truly stresses you out versus what makes you happy when it’s so hard to just be happy."

GriefSupport,fkm0ek8,t3_fj2apl,1584318499.0,Last weekend I was having mini panic attacks about what I would do if my parents were still here... My mom was in remission and on oxygen and my dad on a feeding tube and needed insulin shots.  I’d panic thinking that they wouldn’t have made it through this so I had to keep talking myself down that they aren’t here and I don’t need to worry.  The caregiver mentally doesn’t fade easily and it’s been two years.  Totally feel you on somehow being glad they aren’t alive for it even though I miss them with all of my being.  I’m sorry for all of our loses and for the people that have a chronically ill person in their life that they fear for in these wild times
