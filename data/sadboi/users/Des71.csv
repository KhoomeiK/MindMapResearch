Dallas_Cowboys,fbx5m5q,t1_fbx3293,1577170355.0,"Current NFL Coaches Pete Carroll, Sean Payton, Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh and Doug Pederson have all won Super Bowls without having the top player personnel position for their teams. Jerry and Stephen Jones need to hire the best available head coach and fully support him by allowing him to hire his assistants, acquiring the best players and certainly giving him important input on drafts,  trades, signings, etc. The Cowboys Head Coach should be the top voice of the franchise, so that postgame press conference that Jerry gives which undermines his Head Coach needs to cease immediately."
Dallas_Cowboys,fbx2yai,t1_fbvn6sb,1577167254.0,"As a Cowboys fan since 1975 and someone who has witnessed the entire Jerry Jones era, I strongly disagree that he doesn’t care about winning. Jerry has stated that he desperately wants to win another Super Bowl and has spent countless millions in attempt to do so. He has failed to  hire the best head coaches with the exception of Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells. Also, he let Sean Payton get away to New Orleans. The recent drafts with VP of Player Personnel Will McClay have been much better than when Jerry was the main decision maker. However, until the Cowboys hire a great coach that gets the best out of his talent and that Jerry doesn’t undermine, the sixth Super Bowl victory in Dallas will be but a distant dream for our team."

For example, the iPhone 5s released in Sept. 2013 with iOS 7, received iOS 12.4.1, released on August 26, 2019. Now that's value."
cowboys,ez33uqe,t1_ez25829,1567660674.0,"It’s been that way for decades. A successful Cowboys team is good for the NFL as it increases tv ratings because part of the audience tunes in to root for our Cowboys to lose. The increased ratings makes the league and the Cowboys more money. I brush off the Cowboy haters and remember that we’re not fans of the Bengals, Browns or Lions who’ve never tasted Super Bowl glory."
