aww,fdh6dwo,t1_fdgktkb,1578416356.0,"I don‚Äôt want to get super into it because I get upset, BUT, there‚Äôs a lot of reason why breeding dogs is harmful and unnecessary.  
Leaving dogs unaltered in itself is not great. Accidental pregnancies happen and dogs end up surrendered. The dogs have more behavioral issues. Female dogs get mammary tumors. Male dogs literally hurt themselves licking their penises for stimulation.   
So many people who breed dogs *aren‚Äôt* ‚Äúreputable‚Äù breeders. They‚Äôre people who think their dog is cute and think puppies are cute and want to make some money. More dogs end up in shelters.  
We have also selectively bred dogs for how we think they should look and act, not how they would naturally choose to mate. This has led to severe medical issues for many breeds of dogs (like bulldogs), and lots of less severe but still life-altering issues for other dogs (hip problems in German shepherds/golden retrievers).   
Bulldogs of all breeds have been selectively bred to have enormous heads, short snouts, and narrow hindquarters. It‚Äôs almost impossible for them to give birth naturally and they have to have c-sections. If the mama goes into labor before the c section, babies die and she could die because they start to rot. The surgery alone is dangerous because the mamas body is already under stress from being heavily pregnant.  
Bulldogs also have major breathing problems and often have to have surgery to cut down their soft palate- their snouts were bred shorter, but their soft palate stays the same size. There‚Äôs nowhere for it to go so it just stops them from breathing. They can‚Äôt exercise for more than a few minutes.  

There are A LOT of reasons to not breed dogs at all. We don‚Äôt need more dogs. We breed them selfishly because we want them to look a certain way. Obviously not everyone will stop breeding dogs, so saying ‚Äústop breeding dogs‚Äù is still fine because if even *most* people stop, there are still so many dogs that end up in shelters, dumped, or euthanized. If you can‚Äôt find a specific breed, wait for one at a rescue (puppies go to rescues, pregnant moms go to rescues, perfectly well-behaved purebreds go to rescues because of unfortunate circumstances - and there are breed-specific rescues) or just don‚Äôt get one. There is really no such thing as a ‚Äúreputable breeder in my opinion. We KNOW the problems that we‚Äôve created, but we just think dogs are too cute stop breeding them. Even breeders who make sure all their dogs have papers and vaccines are enabling the problem.   

You can literally google ‚Äúwhy is breeding dogs bad‚Äù and get a ton of information. These are the reasons I personally think it‚Äôs pretty bad. I probably won‚Äôt respond if anyone responds to this comment because information is readily available and it‚Äôs draining. But I‚Äôve answered the question, I think.   

Also dogs and children aren‚Äôt the same. We don‚Äôt selectively breed children to have specific physical traits for no reason other than vanity - at the mental and physical expense of the mother - that lead to lifelong health issues. I still wish people would adopt children more (obviously), but it‚Äôs not at all the same."

Also I let someone have a parking spot even though I was there first because they couldn‚Äôt see my car and put their signal on. No biggie. Turned out to be my friend and I got good karma and someone pulled out of a spot in the same row!

antiMLM,f86ljcf,t3_dzby7p,1574301168.0,"100% a dealbreaker. MLMs aren‚Äôt just a job to people in them. They seep into every aspect of life. They‚Äôre also hella unethical and predatory and I wouldn‚Äôt want to be with anyone willing to knowingly screw people over for cash.

People don't register the dogs so that they can't be traced to them when stuff like this happens. Lots of farms in our area do it, and my house backs up to a cattle farm...
Really upsetting."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,f83qqea,t1_f83qgg9,1574218452.0,I made sure to give her a ton of kisses and treats before they took her back.
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,f83qnys,t1_f83qh12,1574218402.0,I'm mostly concerned that her owners will show up. I don't think they will though because I don't know what kind of person would want animal abuse associated with them. She's in ROUGH shape. Hopefully they just let her find a better home.

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,f83qbkv,t1_f83pqqm,1574218151.0,Me too. A woman who works at the shelter commented that she walked the dog today and that she is a sweetheart but is scared at the shelter. So my heart shattered a little bit. A little under 65 hours before I can make calls to break her out.
