You didn't know what to do. That is reasonable considered that depression is a real disease. I hope he gets some professional help. If so you could ask if you could join him in the next meeting and ask what you should do in which situation.

He is still the same person as before but his emotions prob are almost gone since they became too much to handle.
Keep in mind that no matter how good you are or things in his life are - he will see them worse than they are. Ain't his fault but his reality. So teach him that he can't get rid of you."

The only self improvement you have to do is to love yourself.

Others can't hurt you if you truly believe in yourself.

And honestly even if most ppl are competitive don't assume that everyone wants you down.

There are still a lot of ppl that accept others for who they are. Even if you can't see them at first bc they are the quiet ones. Even if you don't hear them bc they don't brag. They are real and they are around you.

I didn't get why you want to kill yourself honestly.
I hope you won't do it bc I personally dislike the thought of others doing that. I can see why it might be tempting to take an easy way out but that is not easy if you think about that.

Maybe you should try different meds or a different therapist if is not helping you yet"

That is for sure!

If she started your depression or if it's bc of other things... Who knows.

But she simply keeps kicking you down and destroyes any way of getting up.

I believe you should move out asap and stop any contact you have with her.

But you seem to need some professional help, for some time.

Someone needs to show you what normal is, how normal friends are so you loose your paranoia.

Besides that you might need some antidepressants and/or therapy.

It is not your fault, you were neither born this way nor decided to be this way.

But ending your life is - in my honest opposition - simply wrong

It's part of a disease, not your own thought. So ending your life is not what you seek, not what you want. You should give yourself a chance to love yourself, be loved and heal after some time.

Yes, life is unfair. Yes, it ain't easy. But it is worth it!

Go for things you like. Don't accept your thoughts as true. Don't accept your mother's words as true.

It will be hard, but if you stick to yourself and are honest with yourself then you can be happy in the future.

You are good just the way you are.

But your diseases are not."
