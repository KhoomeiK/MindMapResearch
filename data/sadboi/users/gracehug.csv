BreakUps,fnj4bw4,t3_g1t4wk,1586991710.0,"yes! about a month after our breakup i found out he had cheated on me for the second time. before i found out, i would’ve considered going back to him. but now, i know i can’t ever go back. he hurt me so badly, and multiple times. he’ll never get my full trust back and i don’t even know if i love him anymore. he’s such an asshole and i fell for it time and time again. it’s so good to be in this mindset, because i can start to move on, and i am in that process. i just hope he never gets back into my life and plays with my mind like he used to."

BreakUps,fi24aya,t1_fi23yma,1582071140.0,a couple people have. he was my best friend and i don’t have a lot of good friends aside from him which has been hard.
BreakUps,fi23tbr,t3_f5qjnk,1582070825.0,"my ex blamed everything on me. we were both to blame for not trying as hard and not putting as much effort into the relationship as we used to. i was willing to fight for the relationship but he fell out of love with me. he couldn’t really accept that he was having problems in his own life and instead blamed it all on me and my mental illness. i don’t even think he realized he was blaming me, but i took it all so personally."
BreakUps,fi23cl7,t3_f5sox0,1582070523.0,"this is more of a personal one:

i just got out of 4 months residential treatment for my eating disorder. two and a half weeks later my boyfriend of two years broke up with me. 
my psychiatrist told me: “he’s the one missing out. you did amazing work on yourself and your recovery and he’s missing out on the real you, the you that isn’t sick anymore.”

i’m still wishing he could be with me and experience all these amazing changes with me, but at the end of the day i guess it’s his loss. still working on the believability of that statement but i’m working on it."

EatingDisorders,ewaf8o2,t3_cn7lu4,1565242469.0,"yes mine got a lot worse in first year residence! my mom has been the primary fighter in my eating disorder recovery, its like she’s been doing it for me. she makes all my food and gives it to me and makes sure i eat but i never complain because im a people pleaser and dont want to hurt my mom. so when i went into residence i had the freedom to make my own choices on whether or not to eat. i chose not to eat the majority of the time. 
now i was supposed to be going into second year this september but over the summer my ED has gotten even worse so they’re sending me to an inpatient program to work on it before i can go back to uni."
ShaneDawson,eqptykc,t3_bywjz8,1560204359.0,"jeffree has an entire business and makeup line, these things have certainly been in the works for many many months for jeffree. shane has never done this before and although he has the help of jeffree, this is all new and more difficult for him. im sure he’s trying to get it done as quickly as possible but that’s surely difficult. also, to my knowledge i believe jeffree has an editor for his videos which makes it easier for him to do more, while shane and andrew edit all the videos together and have to focus more on that."
