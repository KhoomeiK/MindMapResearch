But without the disk, You could throw a baseball at a black hole, and unless you were a REALLY good aim, you'd almost certainly miss. You'd think there would be no way, it is, after all, a black hole.

Is it the kind of thing where the first virus particle to make it inside of a cell is going to cause a full infection requiring an adaptive immune response, and a large initial exposure just means there will be that many more initial seed points inside the body, thereby advancing the replication substantially, putting the immune system even further behind? 

And is the right thing to care about (in an initial exposure) the number of virus particles that make it to ACE2 receptors? And is this a statistical kind of thing? Like ""I just inhaled 1000 virus particles, but the odds of any one actually making it to replication is 1 in 10,000 due to the innate immune system, so I have a 1 in 10 chance of getting an infection?""

????

There’s nothing sacred about infants or children’s genitals. You’re not harming yourself or them by acknowledging their existence, or seeing them. People change diapers all the time. And kids run around naked all the time. Nudity is a natural human state. 

That said, you’re not 100% wrong. I regard ritual nonconsensual circumcision as sexual assault, and I am indeed directing you to watch a video of an infant being irreparably harmed during the course of a video recorded sexual assault in an American hospital. You’re the one asserting that in the course of the video (that I think contains a traumatic event for the infant) there is no associated psychological harm happening to to the infant. 

But seriously, you think the offensive part of watching a nonconsenting child get a body part cut off is the fact that the child is naked? You’ve got a strange hang-up. 

That’s like saying the offensive part of a... nevermind. There’s nothing I can say here that’s as ridiculous as what you already said.

> When you mention boys, are you talking about routine circumcision on male infants in developed countries? If so, that’s .... not an adverse childhood experience. FGM and other types of mutilation, of course, but I feel like you’re trying to lump in the average circumcised American male with women who get their vulvas sewed together at an age they can actually remember and feel the pain. Correct me if I’m wrong 🤷‍♀️


Hold on a second. First of all, you throw in the word “routine“ before the word “circumcision”. There’s two problems with that. The first is that it’s not a routine for the infant. In general, they get strapped down, sexually violated, and then mutilated, without medical need, and without anesthesia, exactly once. They are fully awake. For them, it is very much not routine. The second problem with using the word “routine” is that it would seem to imply that because something happens often, or a lot, that it is less bad than if it only happened once or twice or never. Imagine if there were such a thing as “routine child rape”. Whether this is used to mean that the rape happens repeatedly to the same child, or if it’s the same individual routinely raping different children, or if there is an organization that is facilitating the routine raping, The “routine“ part of it makes it worse, not better.

Next, you’re ignoring the fact that no adult would ever choose to be circumcised in the way that it is done to infants in medical settings in developed countries. Of course, that wouldn’t matter, because half the point is that the infants are not choosing to have body parts cut off of them. The other half is that this is done without anesthesia, with the person strapped down and immobilized. So what I’m saying is that if I were to grab an adult male off the street and circumcise him using the same methods that are used on infants, he would very much be traumatized by the experience.

If you care to back up your position by way of analogy, can you give me an example of any types of physical assaults that are adverse experiences when they are done to an adult, but are not adverse experiences when done to someone who is some lesser age. Or even tell me about some physically abusive act that becomes non-abusive when the victim is unable to remember it- this is your last point I think, so instead of me refuting your point, why don’t you provide a single instance when it would be true. One example would perhaps be if you were willing to take the stance that raping a woman after giving her a few roofies or while she was passed out drunk, such that she wouldn’t remember the rape, were a far nicer thing than raping her when she was cold sober. That’s not a stance I’ve ever heard anyone take, but if you want to plant a flag there, I suppose you can.

Also, I am not at all convinced that you are familiar with American medicalized male genital mutilation. Please go to YouTube and watch a video of a circumcision happening to a conscious infant. Once you watched the entire thing, come back here and tell me that infant did not have an adverse experience. Note that it does not count if you have the volume off. And yes, I expect this to ruin your day. To anyone who is not the commentor denying that cutting parts of genitals off of other people while they are fully conscious is an adverse experience, please do not go to YouTube to watch this. It will probably ruin your day. The reason I’m not posting a link to it is because I do not want people to click on it while only halfway thinking.

As for your trying to compare male genital mutilation to female genital mutilation, I’m not sure if this subReddit allows for trauma Olympics like that. I know the regular CPTSD subReddit does not. Factually speaking, the type of female genital mutilation you describe constitutes roughly 10% of all female genital mutilation. So if you were going to try to legitimately compare various types, I’m not sure why you would pick that type. It seems like you’re trying to compare being raped to being raped, thrown down the stairs, beaten, and then held at gunpoint for a week, and then somehow coming to the conclusion that merely being raped is not traumatic because the other things didn’t happen.

The other thing you are forgetting is that American medicalized circumcision accounts for maybe 10% of the circumcision that happens. Most of the rest is Islamic, which generally happens at an age where it can be remembered. So in my view, given that the circumcision rate among Muslim males is something close to 99%, almost every Muslim male has had an adverse childhood experience of this type as well.

So yeah. You’re wrong. 

Also, the various types of male and female genital mutilation can be compared quite readily (which is not at all the same as saying that they’re all equally bad). But I’m not doing that here, because this isn’t the place for it."

Like a 4 year old whose imaginary friend is disrespected by her parents will not like her parents. But flip that around, and the parents have an imaginary friend, and their 13 year old daughter just isn't into it, well, I can understand the parents' consternation... but at the same time, the parents have a fucking imaginary friend as adults, and they need to fix that."

High-speed cables didn't change between 1.4 and 2.0, but some manufacturers started stamping HDMI 2.0 Certified on the cables, so ALL the manufacturers had to do it if they wanted to sell the product, because consumers don't read the specs, and salesmen would sound like extreme tools trying to sell you a HDMI 1.4 cable for $25, when the HDMI 2.0 cable next to it is a bargain at $30."
