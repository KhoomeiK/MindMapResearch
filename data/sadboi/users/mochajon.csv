These are “regrettable decisions” and “misjudgments.” Kyle casually called his friend “nigger” as if he was calling him buddy or bro. This is not an example of a mistake or an error in judgement. You don’t call someone that one a whim. This is an example of who exactly a person is, and how they speak behind closed doors.

It’s also much harder than aluminum. The combination of these things creates a smooth, tacky contact surface that creates a lot of friction and heat between the pad and rim. This is also why softer pads work better compared to hard. 
Aluminum on the other hand doesn’t conduct heat well and the milling process creates small grooves in the rim. The grooves can collect dust particles which can cause slipping. The grooves also leave a smaller contact surface which means less heat and less friction for stopping power. 
Tricks I learned to combat slippage on anodized rims:
1.) Rough up your pads with sandpaper to create a rougher, tackier surface.
2.) Don’t run black pads; gum, natural, or those green Diatech type pads grip better.
3.) Spray a little hairspray on your rim (but it’s only good for one session at most.)"

He was pretty bummed about it to say the least, and that depression grew. Also along the way his long term relationship ended and I think DK decided not to re-up his contract. It was just a snowball effect of bad luck. Yes he had head traumas along the way, but this is the timeline of his last years."

They just aren't racist hatemongers, which makes them mostly allies, and alright guys in my book. At best they are fellow punks, at worst they can be a necessary deterrent."

This is why stress or fear lead to heart attacks. Your blood simply gets too thick for your heart to pump it through without added stress on the organ."
