ShitEuropeansSay,fbjm359,t1_fbjcqal,1576936105.0,"The links you provide show the tradition of ""black Pete' (zwarte Piet) who is the help of St Nicholas (sinterklaas). St Nicholas comes on the evening of December 5th to bring presents. While the tradition of St Nicholas is very old (dating back hundreds of years) the help made his entrance only about 150  years ago. The feast is mostly celebrated in the Netherlands and this is also where the discussion about black Pete is the fiercest.

Personally, I understand why the figure of black Pete is racist, after watching black face videos on YouTube. I had no idea before this how racist black face really is. I'm white, so I don't encounter racism directed at me. But most white people in the Netherlands were truly surprised to learn about the racist nature of black face and there is great resistance to give it up. Even the slightest adjustment is largely met with anger.

But be aware that outside the Netherlands, this is not celebrated widely in Europe. I hope the tradition of black Pete will be adjusted or abolished without hurting the core, which is st Nicholas."
