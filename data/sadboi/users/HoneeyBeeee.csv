Anxiety,f0lrmq0,t3_d5g408,1568727769.0,"if you don't think you're ready to go, you probably aren't (not meaning this in a mean way). when you have your exam maybe try to open up, even just a little bit. when you way the odds (at least for me), it will be far better to go out of your comfort zone by opening up and ending up getting out of something than not being honest and ending up in a situation that could ultimately end up worse. This is still completely up to you though, and sorry if this couldn't help at all"
Anxiety,f0lqxa3,t3_d5gro2,1568727224.0,hey! I just wanted to check you are feeling okay? remember there are always people you can talk to if you feel you need to.
Anxiety,f0lon9p,t1_f0loge8,1568725366.0,I do that a bit too. whenever I'm stressed out or bored I find myself saying a sentence over and over and over. it can get a bit overwhelming because I iust can't stop ðŸ˜¬
Anxiety,f0lo0xi,t3_d5g6m9,1568724829.0,I feel you.
Anxiety,f0lnuyg,t3_d5exj7,1568724684.0,"OCD doesn't need to define your life, but it can. I'm not in any way a professional. my OCD is not very severe but it has made life harder. you asked whether or not it can affect academics, so these are just some ways it's affected mine. I normally spend an hour every night making sure my whole room is perfect, or more so right. this leads to me going to bed late, and waking sad and angry, but I still have to go to school. also, (this happens to me in class) I spend about 10 minutes figuring out how my desk needs to be arranged, which means I can't start working as fast as I need to. I don't have as much time to do homework either (because of my rituals). There are obviously other things, but these are the main ways it messes up my ability to do school. Also, to your question as to whether or not it's justifiable to have it affect school - it is! OCD is just like any other ""mental disorder"" and you really have no control over it. If you think you have OCD, you should really talk to someone. if you treat before it gets worse (possibly, again I'm not too sure whether it gets worse or not!) it won't take as much of a toll. even if it can't get worse, living with OCD is not exactly fun, so you may as well try therapy / medication to make it easier to handle. Sorry if this was all over the place, I wrote it on mobile in like twn minutes. I really hope this may have helped answer some of your questions!"
