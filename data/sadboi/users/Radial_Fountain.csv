drawing,fdtvycj,t1_fdtvbk4,1578723095.0,"It’s crooked, and it’s too long. So don’t worry about it, you got it right.

I sent it to a friend, and he critiqued it for me. I love critique, so don’t feel bad about critiquing the drawing!"
drawing,fdtthm8,t1_fdtn5em,1578721946.0,"Thank you!

This is not what I wanted it to be, but I really like the drawing! It’s definitely something I’m proud to have in my book."
gamedev,fdmg1kw,t1_fdmfpd9,1578548680.0,"Ok, I’m very well versed in the latest tech and news. So becoming a part-time writer for a journal would be a good way to earn side money?"
gamedev,fdme9mp,t1_fdmahmf,1578547065.0,"That never really went anywhere.

At this point, I’m basically searching for anything computer-related that will pay even just a little bit. 

I’m just searching for communities or sites that will allow me to find something at least part-time."

However, there are some things you could improve on. 

Ambient occlusion—basically the detail in the shadow is not as prominent as the detail in the light. By reducing the detail in the shadows, you reduce the overall noise of the piece which is more pleasant to look at. [This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ZJkIaMECW6c) from one of my most favorite artists goes into better detail about ambient occlusion and provides some examples."

Definitely not ugly, like a solid 7/10 coming from a guy. Attraction points go up as you get to know a person."
introvert,f9jra1q,t1_f9f58vo,1575383743.0,"Sorta the same here.

High functioning cognitive empathy. I can literally feel the emotion wafting off the person, but I have a very hard time comforting them. I’m not sure what to do or say in a situation where emotion runs high. 

I always blunder and make things worse."

Not worth loving, still desiring love anyway."
depression,f9j26wj,t1_f9hyho9,1575353191.0,"I relate to you and OP too much. If I die alone, I’d be perfectly ok with that. Nobody deserves to get dragged down to where I’m at. I can’t do that to someone, because it’s not fair to them. They deserve so much better."
AskMen,f33jezr,t3_dfft04,1570639684.0,"I’m not doing so well.

University is dumping all over me with its debts and stress. I am doing terribly in the ladies department. No one seems to listen to me or even acknowledge my existence. 

I constantly have to step in a repair everyone else’s relationships for them. I’m a crutch in the sense that everyone asks me for money/help/homework, and it’s pissing me off. 

I feel completely worthless. After work, I’m going to the store and getting a journal to write in so I don’t go insane while I’m here."
