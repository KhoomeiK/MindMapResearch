After cleansing and annoiting the crown I set my intention to journey to my power animal, then once I start drumming I start to move my body then dance in any way that suits the beat. As long as you are moving fast and get the energy as high as you can (the more effort you put in, the higher the energy will be) it doesn't really matter what you do, as far as I am aware there is no 'right' or 'wrong' way to dance, just feel the beat of the drum in your heart and go for it!  Set the intention to send the energy to your power animal once you start moving. I usually feel the energy rise then drop suddenly - that's when I lie down and focus on my heart energy centre to drop down into middle earth. Your power animal will be waiting for you."
Shamanism,ffp9403,t3_euc2wd,1580089258.0,"When I journey I cleanse the space (and myself) with incense, set my intention, and use florida water or essential oils on my third eye and crown. I then ask for my spirit animal to meet me and as per the comment above ask them what they can teach me (the first time) I also ask for them always to be present and now they are always there and take me anywhere I need to go to get information/retrieve power. I then thank them. 

Also - Try sending the energy you create while dancing and drumming to your power animal, it will strengthen the bond.    

Hope that helps, good up the good work!"

Everyone has a guardian angel but you can work with specific ones for specific intentions (protection, guidance, cutting cords that no longer serve you, love..) and you may have many around you at one time.
