I mentioned here earlier that my ex finally opened one of my emails and got back to me about some family photos I left at his house when we broke up like three years ago.  We had been planning on getting married and were in the process of buying a house together, and then he started lying to me about a bunch of stuff, including that he had started drinking again and stopped taking his antabuse and his bipolar meds, and was hiding all of that, so I left. I've been trying to get him to send me my family photos ever since but he's been ignoring me emails.

This morning I woke up to a shitload of emails from him (all sent within a few hours) being all ""you're so important to me, I would never ignore you, I would never intentionally hurt you"" and these novel-length emails about how everything has been going wrong for him since we broke up. It was clearly trying to get me to engage with him and feel bad for him and console him. 

He asked me to text him, so I did and promptly got another flurry of emails as well as long emotional texts. He was trying to get me to engage again and was beating around the bush, so I called him to explain that I just wanted my photos back. He talked about himself for ages and then cheerily asked ""so how are you?! :D"" This really caught me off guard and I was super uncomfortable so I just said, ""umm, I'm fine."" He was like ""just fine?"" Clearly teasing for more information. And I just said ""yeah."" He got mad and hung up. 

Just now he texted me that he found my photos and is sending them to me, but ""since we can't interact in a way that is healthy"" to please delete his contact information after this. He's implying that I'm the problem when he was flat-out manic and manipulative and way oversharing and trying to get information out of me and trying to make me feel bad for him, but I'M the problem?! Wtf. 

So I just told him that I didn't plan to ever contact him again, I just wanted my photos back.

I'm livid. Just hearing his voice made me angry. I feel sick to my stomach and I'm just so pissed off.

She's crafty, haha. She got me to agree to doing one favor for her and then sloooowly added more things to the list until she was asking me to do *everything* for her. Regular laundry, plus special laundry (big blankets that have to go all the way to the laundromat because they don't fit in our machines), plus grocery shopping at three different stores each three times a week (not including all the trips to return/exchange things because she kept writing down the wrong flavors/scents/sizes on her grocery list), plus cleaning... It was just too much, plus she was slowly ramping up her efforts to convert me to her religion too, and saying lots of really frustrating things about my depression like ""well you don't *look* depressed.""

I'm on disability for depression and I have a physical disability, the latter isn't terrible but she's more active than I am despite using a walker. She goes to the gym (at least when we're not in quarantine) daily. I can't run and even walking quickly becomes painful for me, so to have me doing all her chores, between the stress and the physical component... It's just too much.

I'm much closer to my mother and sister than I am to my brother and father because there's always been a huge gender divide in my family, but I'm finally getting close to my brother and dad in the last year or so. My father took me to my appointments when I was getting ECT, and my brother moved back into the town I live in, so I've gotten a lot closer with them than I used to be.

But if I do end up going no contact with my mother and sister again -- and it does look like I'll have to sooner or later -- I'll try to do a better job of standing up to my brother and dad and telling them they have to respect my boundaries and just be glad I'm standing up for myself. 

I've been talking to them a lot lately about how terribly my mother and sister have been treating me, and they still don't ""get it"" really, partially because they think I should be as detached as they are, and partially because my mother and sister are always taking aim at me specifically, not my brother or dad, so it doesn't affect them in the same way.

Not even an hour later I have a migraine. üòÇ It's been working soooo much worse than it used to lately -- I went from like three plus migraines a week to almost no migraines at all for a couple years to migraines three or more times a week again. In a few minutes I have a phone call with the headache clinic to talk about changing to a different medication. I hope we can find something that works as well as Aimovig used to. üò≠"

NoFeeAC,fqidrgy,t1_fqhkf0a,1589394650.0,"I thought I was reading yesterday that NMT can't be duped, just 1x1 and 2x1 furniture. There was a thread somewhere in one of the AC subs telling people not to accuse others of duping or try to certify that their items aren't duped, because there's no point when there isn't any way to police or verify/disprove."

ACTrade,fqi33ox,t3_gizhw0,1589389081.0,Definitely Goldie or Rosie. They're such rays of sunshine that I need them back in my life. I just opened up pocket camp again recently just to see them.
