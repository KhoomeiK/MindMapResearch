1. I personally think the purple look cooler
2. Last night we spent an entire night in multiple melee fights against all the “gangs” and won all of them.
3. The green aliens where originally the ones who would attack random players (don’t get me wrong it’s funny as shit) so that made all the other factions/ gangs form.
4.  we’re the underdogs (green aliens seem to have a bigger following) and as we know from movie logic the underdogs always win.

Anyway thank you from coming to my ted talk.

Also if you look on TikTok it’s taken off massively just like how it has on Reddit."
