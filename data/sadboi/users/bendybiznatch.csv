While not iron clad, there is some scientific and a LOT of empirical/anecdotal evidence that THC can trigger schizophrenia in those genetically predisposed to it. I can tell you for the schizophrenics I know THC is a one way ticket to an eventual psychosis episode. 

It can be the initial trigger, which leads to the urban legend that cannabis causes schizophrenia in normal individuals. The thing is how do you know you’re genetically predisposed until it happens. Granted, it’s 1.3% of the population. But considering they make up about 25% of the homeless and jail population, it’s obvious the disorder has a huge sociological impact, let alone financial, and we should do all we can to mitigate that.

I’m gonna be brutally honest here. I’m not sure if you actually want that or not. 

That whole quote is a huge red flag to me. It says “I’m justified in a behavior that negatively affects people I love because I have BPD.” That is exactly the stigma that people have. 

I know it’s hard to behaviorally condition yourself to not have that reaction. Every time you allow yourself to have an inappropriate emotional reaction, your actually behaviorally conditioning yourself to not just more easily react inappropriately next time, but each time it gets harder to not react inappropriately. 

Conversely, you can train yourself to not do that. It’s not easy. The first 100 times you probably won’t be very successful. The next 1,000 times it’s a little better. The 1,000 times after that a little better. And on and on and on.

That’s not to say that it’s not appropriate to cry if someone hurts you or someone/something you love. Or you suffer a tragedy or major disappointment. Crying is a reasonable response in those cases. But if you’re crying during mundane disappointments and frustrations, yes you’re creating a toxic environment for the people around you and should address that honestly.

There is appropriate crying, and there is crying that makes you the center of attention. I’m not sure if you’re aware, but dealing with someone like that feels like being gaslighted, walking on eggshells, and like your feelings don’t hold value. After a while it becomes a trigger. 

You starting to break out in tears over trivial matters should be a behavioral trigger to employ your coping mechanisms.
