And even then you'd be right to leave. This isn't even that. 

And also to consider... A common question is, ""If he's so 'out of control' why doesn't he ever hurt himself or his things during these states?"" If his anger is so intense, why are you the subject of the violence? If he's really ""out of his mind"" why isn't he banging his head against a wall and punching himself? Maybe because he is aware enough to not want to feel pain and not care/in the moment want to inflict it on you.

I worked in education for a long time and now work in a job for which I have to learn a lot of names. I'm TERRIBLE at remembering names, even the most common names. But that's on ME. 

And I also don't believe in introducing students for the first time to me/the class with something that isn't their name. So, when I first meet a class/student/client, I ask them how to pronounce their name and point it out on my attendence sheet (before I ever attempt it, no matter how ""common"" it is in my native language). Then, if I think I'll have any trouble, I mark next to name in a way that I'll remember phonetically when I read it the next time.

I also do this because as a white teacher I believe in actively doing all I can to not perpetuate harmful experiences, which can often include butchering someone's name repeatedly (this can happen to anyone of any race but this especially happens to POC in the US). 

Also, I'll name that I have a very easy English name, but one that has two different equally common pronunciations with the way it is spelled. I usually don't care, don't bother to correct people when they pronounce it incorrectly. HOWEVER, that's because it is near enough to my name that I know they're talking about me usually AND I also have a casual sense that if someone doesn't remember my real name, I'm just not very close to them. It isn't retaliation, but you know someone doesn't care a ton of they don't listen when you've said your name a bunch. With this situation, he's crossing that line tenfold to actively refusing to learn it close enough.

Imagine if hated your given name and asked everyone to call you a nickname or something like that (I know a Eugene who gets upset when people don't call him Gene as he introduces himself and a Samantha who gets mad when people call her Sam when she always asks people not to because she hates it). In either of those circumstances, I'm sure you'd just call them by the name variation they asked for/introduced. You just make a mental note and move on.

So...how is it special privileges for GNC/trans folks to do a totally normal thing and ask for the same treatment cis folks get? How does a gender neutral bathroom hurt you (esp if single stall??)?

I wish this WAS actually an unpopular opinion. Unfortunately, lots of people agree with you and see equal rights as ""special privileges"""
CPTSD,f6ay452,t3_dqwa2l,1572764638.0,"Hey, sounds like you're doing a great job not blaming your spouse or yourself and just recognizing this is what is being evoked in you! 
I love what you're saying about grounding. I havent had this exact situation, but I'm non-binary and have cptsd and sometimes get depersonalized or dissociated, especially with my partner. Your brain will eventually get used to any new normal. While your brain is adjusted, I'd say you could try to pick the things you reliably know will be there (on your spouse or-even more importantly-on yourself and in the room) and list them. Wake up and immediately look for the dresser or the light or your side table something concrete. You can leave out notes around with things that are the positive and same in yourself and your relationship. See if any familiar pet names or items (ring maybe?) Provide a sense of stability. 

Also anything to connect with your own body. Count your fingers, tap your thighs. 

I know this might not help but just what comes to mind from your post. Congrats on reaching out for therapy support."

I'll add that also consider maybe there's part of your brain that feels more comfortable knowing you only have a small contained amount of time and won't go to deep/is scared to share but doesn't want to ""miss your chance"" so it finally pushed through it by the end.
""door knob statements"" as they're known in the therapy world are super common. Clients often ""drop"" the most important things at the end when there isn't much time to address them. It is a way of protecting from the topic usually and distancing from it. Totally normal, but consider this might be what your brain is trying to do to stop you from addressing yourself deeply and ""selfishly"" (allow yourself to take up space! You're ""paying"" for it!)."

ptsd,f3stkv1,t3_dhzv4k,1571109079.0,"Remember that most things we do around trauma are things that were protective (helped us survive) that don't serve us anymore. So, this could be your body trying to get you to always remember/be on guard so you're never ""caught off guard"" or ""unprotected"" ever again. Your body remembers pain/trauma and wants to protect you. So it might be ""not letting you heal"" because it wants to keep reminding you what could happen/not to relax. That's what PTSD usually is around- your body continuing to send the signals that you're in danger so you can do what you need to do.
Only that feels horrible when you're not in danger anymore.

Regardless of the reason, You're not alone in this. I do the same thing in slightly different ways; my brain never lets me forget anything for long. I'd recommend trauma focused therapy and body work in some way."

So, for example, indigenous folks not being able to wear traditional dress (cultural genocide, not getting employment for not dressing ""Western"" etc) but then a white person comes in and starts selling things that are completely based on the culture and make Anton of money off of it and get away with it because of white privilege (it is now seen as ""fashionable"" and a ""unique choice"" instead of ""barbaric/unprofessional.""). This is especially true when something is exploited that is ceremonial or reverent. 
That is the issue. 
Respectfully engaging in cultural exchange is different. 
You don't get to systemically try to erase someone's culture, pick the pieces you want, and then sell them for profit and then get mad saying it is ""racist"" not to share.
History is not that simple. And this still happens to do. White folks can wear things/do things/say things POC could never get away with even if it is from their culture."
