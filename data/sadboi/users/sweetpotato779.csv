BPD,exsccyh,t3_cu9apm,1566539733.0,That sucks that things are so bad right now that it's hard to even sit there and be conscious of the world around you because it's terrifying you so much right now.

BPD,exs9jy4,t1_exs80xw,1566536729.0,"I hear you on how hard that can be even if you understand why they left. Between me and my FP, he is far the more BPD one, and he's been having the worst splits I've ever seen him have and damn it has been terrifying at some points. I can see why from the beginning he was so sure his behavior was gonna eventually drive me away even though I'd been super understanding about everything for so long. I put up with A LOT of shit from him because I know it comes from the illness and that he isn't like that when he's calm. But it never quelled his fears for long and I'm starting to understand why. I think I misunderestimated the severity of his abandonment anxiety. He'd been trying to communicate that to me but I didn't quite get it until lately when I started seeing the really bad splits.

And these splits have kinda turned my world upside down and I've been scrambling to evaluate the situation and figure out what the fuck is even going on and then what I should do about it. Through trial and error, though, I'm figuring it out. Like it finally dawned on me that I'm putting way too much pressure on my FP--it's a level far above what he's used to from me--and that I need to tone it down and get him used to lower levels of pressure before putting him into what feels like absolute anxiety hell. And I figured out that I was not validating nearly enough so I made sure to give him some of that. So I'm slowly figuring this out. And also it doesn't appear that leaving is an option because we are so extremely bonded to each other that we probably couldn't keep from visiting one another's social media or outright contacting each other even if we tried and I don't know if I could live with knowing I abandoned him to his fate. I know that gazillions of people would tell me that I don't deserve abuse and that I have to do what is best for me but is abandoning him really what's best for me?? I'm crying right now just thinking about it. I know I didn't cause his problems and there is only so much I do to help him with them but it just doesn't sit well with me to abandon someone who is so dear to me. Yeah, he's done some fucked up things, but I can't hate him for it.

I just hope we can get through this and stay together. I'm utilizing every positive BPD resource I have right now, especially ones that focus specifically on male BPD because I have a deficiency of knowledge in that area.

So anyway, I'm sorry that you just lost another relationship. That's such a tragedy. I know how deeply BPD people bond. I hope you can make lemonade from these lemons and become a better, stronger person for it."
BPD,exs6pcx,t3_ctx7br,1566534026.0,Love this post. BPD is an awful fucking thing sometimes and I've been seeing some of the worst it can bring out of a person. But it still is an illness and a treatable one at that. Borderlines deserve compassion just as much as diabetics and cancer patients.
BPD,exs6c25,t1_exs5q3n,1566533694.0,Yeah I hear you on that. I do something similar when I'm worried about somebody leaving me and I just let myself slip into misery and feel depressed about the situation as if they're already gone because it's better than fear. And I also notice that I can think better when mild to moderately depressed than I can when I'm really anxious. My FP the other day was talking about how he seems to only have motivation to work on himself when he's depressed and I think it has something to do with the fact that he feels very anxious almost all of the time but when he's depressed it might be a break from that and if he's not extremely scared then he can actually take an honest look at himself and see about doing work on his skills in managing himself.
BPD,exs5tu1,t3_cu8cd7,1566533241.0,"Validation. Borderlines need lots of that. They need to have people around them who accept their emotions no matter what they are even if they're causing bad actions. A big drive-train behind splitting is feeling that your feelings are being denied or not taken seriously. Validation, honest and sincere, can shatter that and bring you back to your senses."

I don't think so. I don't think anybody can reason very well when their minds are flooded with fear.

To break out of this, it helps to start writing about what I fear and examine the evidence for and against it. Then I often see that my fear was wrong."

Making a thread here is one way to do it but if you find you're not getting very many responses, you can also go commenting on others people's threads and trying to lift them up. In doing so, you could also lift yourself up. And if somebody has a similar experience to your breakup, that's an opportunity to share your experience with them and have some solidarity."
BPD,exnj4hz,t3_ctreeh,1566457380.0,"I can relate to this in the sense that when I know I have to drive somewhere on a certain day, I never know if my anxiety is gonna kick in big time the night before and keep me from sleeping. When I can't sleep, I can't drive. If I have no other ride, I can't go.

Thankfully, though, it doesn't really affect me for places I'm used to going like my therapist, college (when I was a student), the grocery store, and other routine places. It's mostly a problem for one-off things like going to a Corgi Beach Day or something. I probably wouldn't sleep for that.

It can also  happen rarely with a routine place if I have a reason to be unusually worried about going there. Like when I had to quit college for the last time, I was so ashamed to face my therapist again, because the whole point of my therapy had been to get my symptoms under enough control that I could complete my degree.

I managed to make it to the appointment on 2 hours of sleep and half of a 5 Hour Energy. I drank another half on the way home and it would have been fine but for some reason I thought it was a good idea to turn and go the opposite direction of my house to a fast food place, eat lunch, and then drive home. I drank coffee with my lunch but by the time I drove home I was pretty loopy and for some reason I saw no problem with making a right turn from the far left lane. Didn't realize it until I was almost out of the intersection. Yikes.

I learned an important lesson that day: Even with caffeine, if I absolutely have to drive on a tired day, don't stay out any longer than I have to!

I really probably shouldn't have driven that day at all but I was so determined to get to my appointment."

I fucking hated RA at first because when I was angry at myself the last thing I wanted to do was accept anything, but I kept kicking myself in the ass to do it and eventually it became habit. Now I'm pretty good with RA unless I'm really fucking emotional. Like video games are still a big trigger for me but in normal activities I do pretty well.

So, I think any god that would penalize a person for not picking the ""right"" religion (and the right denomination of that religion) is extremely unreasonable. It's like that god made getting into heaven (or some other favorable afterlife) a total crapshoot not unlike playing the lottery.

Oh and speaking of religion, I'm Atheist now but when I was Christian and going to church a lot, men who show their emotion was the norm. A big deal was made out of following the example set by Jesus in the bible. And ""Jesus wept""  is famous as the shortest verse in the bible. So in that church environment it was totally okay for men to cry and I saw it sometimes. Instead of feeling disgusted, I felt impressed by their bravery because as you well know, when a man shows emotion there's always the risk that a judgmental person will see it and say something mean."
BPD,exfsy8f,t1_exfo40z,1566247691.0,"I was responding based on the use of the word ""society."" Society is everybody, isn't it? So that's where I got the line of reasoning of every single person being accepting of men like yourself.

Or are you just talking about the most common beliefs held by a large group of people? (Westerners, in this case.) Are you saying that you will find it difficult to accept yourself unless a majority of these people hold the belief that you are acceptable? If so, what would feel like a majority in your case? 51% is technically a majority but still that leaves 49% which is a big number. 

Anyway, the only point I was trying to make is that while there will always be assholes who look down at you, especially if you go against whatever is most common in a society, but the people who will accept--even look up to--you are more than zero, and often much more :)"

BPD,exe7gkt,t1_exe5wu1,1566202171.0,I have some BPD traits. As well as ADHD.
BPD,exe5d4b,t3_csd93d,1566199172.0,"I think there is no one right answer here and that you'll have to decide what's best for your situation. For me, when I realized my current FP has BPD, I told him, but around the same time I also realized that one of my exes had it too. I elected not to tell the ex because we were totally non-contact by then. He had in the past tried to become friends and I had declined his offer. I felt bad that he might go the whole rest of his life not knowing about his BPD but I didn't want to muddy the waters by re-establishing contact, however brief. I've long since moved on from that relationship and am heavily attached to my FP now. It felt like talking to my ex would just be asking for trouble. Plus who knows if he would have believed I knew what I was talking about. And even if he did believe me it doesn't mean the knowledge would benefit him because BPD is only treatable for those who are willing to put in the tremendous effort needed to beat it. Unfortunately, I don't think that's most people. When I knew my ex he thought he had regular depression and he wasn't doing very much about it.

That said, it does bother me that I'm withholding potentially important information but what bothers me way more is he fact my FP lost his fucking mind upon finding out he's not the only BPD person I've ever been emotionally involved with. I think he thinks he's interchangeable with any guy for whom the letters B-P-D are applicable and that any day now I'm gonna drop him and chase after my ex. And I guess I kinda encourage him viewing himself like a commodity because I talk about his BPD and recovery way too fucking much and attribute too many of his good qualities to being a borderline. Of course, the two are related, but I don't think BPD is anybody's whole personality. If it was, then why can people have multiple personality disorders? And a personality is a huge, complicated thing that can never be completely measured or categorized, so of course everybody with BPD is unique. My heart can tell my FP apart from other borderlines and it's really resistant to attaching to anyone else, BPD or not. My FP is who I want and even the thought of being lovey-dovey again with my ex feels nauseating and wrong.

But convincing my FP of that (at least on a deep level) is a tall order, so I see not contacting the ex a lesser of two evils. If I have to choose between looking out for the best interests of the FP and that of somebody who's been gone for years, I'll choose my FP every time. 

So yeah, this is my situation. You'll have to do a similar analysis on yours and decide for yourself what is best."
BPD,exe13qg,t3_csantv,1566193793.0,"I don't think it's in the same class, but when I was put on Abilify, the first day I had intense urges to hurt myself and I followed my mom around that day, so she could keep an eye on me. I didn't wanna take a chance."
BPD,exe11ge,t1_exdp6pu,1566193723.0,I second this.
BPD,exe04uo,t3_csb8l5,1566192735.0,"I went like 10 years or something once without cutting. That was cool. But now I'm only 8 months clean, I think. But I scared myself pretty bad the last time I cut, so maybe I won't do it again.

Anyway good job on having the five years."
BPD,exdzmnu,t1_exdzdo9,1566192182.0,"Yeah, that makes sense. I don't leave the house much and am alone a lot, so when I get really lonely the most annoying person in the world looks promising. I'd like to have quality relationships but they're not available to me right now, so I take whatever bone somebody wants to throw."
BPD,exdzf95,t3_csbskq,1566191958.0,I don't have an emotional connection to anyone in my family. Probably because they can be pretty invalidating and we don't really see eye-to-eye. I'm attached to my FP and that's about it unless you count missing lost friendships. The latter manifests in feeling depressed.
BPD,exdz8jr,t3_csbwgq,1566191754.0,"I don't know why it's so hard, either. But I had a shower today, yay! :)"
BPD,exdyqnd,t3_csccdb,1566191224.0,Oh man being thrown away sucks. It's gotten so bad for me that I can't even get anybody to pick me up to begin with. 24 hours is generally about the max amount of time anybody wants to associate with me. And I have no idea why because I go out of my way to be nice.
BPD,exdykzt,t3_csce62,1566191056.0,I wish somebody wanted to tell me their problems or mundane b/s. I'd settle for that. But yeah I see where you're coming from.
BPD,exd6xmk,t3_cs4ynj,1566168789.0,"How do you find people who want to use you? I can't even get that. For the past 20 years my only opportunity to make friends has been online and a long time ago that was really easy. It wasn't hard to find people that would stick around for at least a few months. But things got harder and harder and now it's to the point it's rare I can keep anybody talking to me longer than *24 hours*! If I can keep somebody answering my messages for a week that's a really fucking long time. I have my BPD traits under pretty good control and I've read all kinds of friendship guides but it seems like they don't apply to the online world. It's like no matter what I do I just bore people or creep them out.

I had my FP but I have no idea right now if he's even alive because I found out he had a crisis yesterday and I haven't been able to get a hold of him. I hope he's fine and just fucking with me to see what I'll do. It's gonna really suck if he is indeed gone because he was all I had. :("
BPD,exa0ne8,t3_crvqre,1566097176.0,"I'm sorry working is so tough for you right now. I've only ever had volunteer jobs but they are really hard on my mental health. At the last one I kept making mistakes that I knew better than to make and was constantly terrified of doing. It was an animal shelter and it was important to always put the dogs we walked back in the kennel they were taken out of because they might fight if put in with an unfamiliar kennelmate. Well despite constantly stressing over this and checking like three times to make sure I had the right kennel, I managed to put a dog back in the wrong kennel and they fought. It was just cuts and bruises and none of my superiors were mad at me but it was so scary because I'd just done what I'd been trying with all my might not to do.

I think a lot of my stupidity came from the fact I wasn't really sleeping. I was so stressed up and anxious at night that sometimes I'd go there on only two hours of sleep. More than once I almost got in a car accident either on the way there or home just because I was an idiot behind the wheel. I'd do everything I could to focus and pay attention like saying out loud everything I was doing as I did it, and it wasn't enough.

Like I had a big fear of not stopping at stop signs or not looking both ways before I pulled out from one. When approach them I'd tell myself over and over again that I'm gonna stop and then I'm gonna look, I'm gonna stop and then I'm gonna look. Well by the time I got there I could very well have a brain fart and pull out without looking. Almost got me hit more than once. It's why I now refuse to drive tired. I'm an idiot when I'm tired and there isn't much I can do about it except stay home.

This is why I could never work outside my house. I couldn't go to work on any days I didn't get much (or any sleep) and I'd get fired pretty quick because those days happen a lot when I'm under stress."
BPD,ex9hhtn,t3_crthps,1566088860.0,"Just throwing this out there but maybe you could write a letter where you go over the thoughts and feelings you're struggling with right now and what appears to be causing them and what you've done, unsuccessfully, to try and control them. Then when you get to your next therapist session read it. Then maybe that would give them a window into the you outside the office and actually get them to be helpful to you."
BPD,ex5r9jh,t3_crhcj6,1566030122.0,"I understand how you feel. When my FP is not having symptoms he's the sweetest thing ever. When he's splitting, depending on how bad it is, it can be pretty scary. Overtime though I've gotten better at talking to him when he's in that state and have gotten better at getting through to him and making him realize that I'm not out to hurt him. It's like a fog lifts and he's himself again. The sweetheart I fell in love with. And then we can talk like two regular people and he hears me.

I encourage you to master the art of validation because that's really what their mind is looking for when they get all worked up into a split. They need to feel like you accept how they're feeling. That doesn't necessarily mean you agree with what they're saying, but they need to know that you see their feelings as reasonable. That can get you through the mental filter that makes everything you say sound like an attack, no matter how kindly you word it. Getting validated helps them gain access again to their reasoning and be able to understand whatever it is you wanna explain to them like that, for example, that you don't hate them--if the episode started because they think they're hated by you. If you just go right into telling them you don't hate them, they could just get more upset.

If you haven't read it already, I recommend the book, ""Loving Someone with Borderline Personality Disorder"" because it explains how to do this and it could help you have the conversations with your BF where you let him know how his behavior is making you feel. If it stresses him out and he splits, the validation could help you bring him back and continue the conversation."
BPD,ex5fw88,t1_ex56i3c,1566023039.0,"Check with your local social security office but at least for me I can work up 9 months and make as much as I want and not have it effect my benefits whatsoever. After that I can use the ticket to work and I have several months to try to ease into working while still receiving full benefits and eventually either you fail horribly and just go back to not working or you stay in the workforce and stop getting benefits.

I've never tried any of this though because I'm so afraid of somehow losing my benefits."
BPD,ex51cpv,t1_ex50ncc,1566014820.0,You're welcome :)
BPD,ex50igd,t1_ex4zopk,1566014380.0,"Yeah a lot of the typical videos are just the same fake shit over and over again. Boring. 

And some is a positive quantity whereas none is, well, nothing :) So some people > no people.

Of course you know that but I wanted to emphasize it because I know how BPD loves to filter our experiences with a negative bias. BPD will look at the fact that some people is not all people and not let you think about how it's more than no people."
BPD,ex4zrpb,t3_crguxq,1566013995.0,"Unless you count the super complicated relationship between me and my FP, I haven't been in a relationship since 2015. And I don't feel no shame :)"
BPD,ex4zct3,t3_crfjth,1566013783.0,"Realize that porn is not realistic. Most women (at least where I live) are not stick thin and often are outright obese. Yet tons of them are in relationships and have kids so apparently somebody fucked them. Plus most men don't have monster cocks. 5 inches is about average in the US.

Also overweight porn is a thing. Some people are into that."
BPD,ex46bpz,t3_cr5d14,1565999392.0,It's given me a framework for understanding and getting along with my BPD FP and to a lesser extent myself (I'm BPD traits.) When my FP splits or self sabotages or gets real jealous or whatever it helps me recognize what's going on and react appropriately. Otherwise I'd be able to detect some anxiety and depression but not be able to see the core patterns and beliefs that are creating these distressing feelings and others.
BPD,ex45oxa,t3_cr6oqf,1565998997.0,"My FP has 9999999999 friends, both genders, and I don't care but he has a hard time with me talking to males and it's not much of a problem now because I don't have any friends but I'm a bit concerned about how he'll react when I do eventually get some more friends. I'm 34 and will probably live at least 30 more years, so chances are I'll make some friends in that time. I don't wanna disqualify a potentially good friend just because they have outdoor rather than indoor plumbing."
BPD,ex454wi,t3_crbai3,1565998660.0,"I really hate the idea of getting naked with somebody I don't even know, much less allow them to shove their dick in me. Seriously, I don't know where that thing has been! xD

At least in a relationship you have some idea what you're getting into."
BPD,ex16gty,t3_cr0u03,1565932387.0,"I can mostly tolerate the local news but when my mom has Fox News going seemingly all day long, that's hard to deal with. I'm not against religious people or conservatives per se but I hate hearing the tv talking shit all day about people like me saying I'm an abomination just because I'm different. Plus I hate arguing and negativity and the news channels geared toward only one site are so hateful toward the opposite side. I hate it even on stations that support stuff that's closer to my views."
BPD,ex0zsbm,t3_cr0hyp,1565926444.0,"Hard to say without knowing you but yes it is possible that this is BPD-related. A lot of BPD people, myself included, have trouble sticking to the same routine over a long period of time because it eventually becomes emotionally unbearable. Powering through works until it doesn't. It eventually gets to the point where constant mental pain makes focus impossible.

That said, there are some things you can check:

\#1 How are you breathing? I often find myself taking shitty little quick shallow breaths. Consciously forcing myself to take deep, slow breaths can sometimes make me instantly able to focus.

\#2 How's your muscles? When I'm stressed and check in with my body, I often find myself tensing up in certain areas. Like when I'm laying in bed with the laptop I often find that I'm arching my back and all tense in my core. It helps a lot to put a rolled up sheet or blanket or something under my low back to support it. You too might get tension in your body that's your body saying it isn't getting the proper support it needs. Make your workstation as ergonomic as possible and keep your muscles strong and supple. And foam rollers are fucking awesome! I have the blue medium rumble roller and it is the only thing sometimes that can get my neck to fucking relax. It mimics a deep tissue massage. AMAZING

\#3 Do a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of what's causing you tension. Run-of-the-mill stress management articles can hit on a bunch of areas to check. You can also go farther analyze your study system and see if anything about it is feeling overly tedious or is not effective enough.

I hope you get this figured out."
