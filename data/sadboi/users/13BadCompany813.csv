 Being in the teaching field, I have so many training classes to take per year for continuing education, and I have no problem learning and testing, but ask me what I did an hour ago and I've got nothing. What helps me is to keep pen and paper with me, and my phone as well to always take notes and reminders for myself.
Have a blessed day!"

I'm better at the horse races. Have won over 1 mil within a few days."
