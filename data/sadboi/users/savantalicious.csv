I have the auspicious fortune of also being highly intelligent (says my therapist) which allows me to logic my way into relative day to day functionality while melting down in my head. Some would say my ability to hold down a job, for example, is very rare. I have also whittled down my personal relationships to two people, which avoids the turbulent relationship marker. But it actually still exists for me, in my head. 

My point here is that sometimes yes; someone can check off only some criteria and still get a diagnosis of BPD. Someone may also have extremely high potential to manifest, but consciously avoids, the symptom. Which in itself is a symptom lol. We also may not perceive the situation as others may. Ok, now I‚Äôm rambling.

BPD,fo94ahp,t3_g61u5j,1587610212.0,"I say yes - but I‚Äôm also in a relationship where they are less my FP and more a legit support system. What I mean is... Just Lind of suggesting that the approach in this post may or may not be an act of splitting, putting it into all or nothing terms. 

I‚Äôm 35 as of March of this year. I went years and years going through a gamut of intense, firecracker relationships where it‚Äôs basically INTENSE DESIRE then OBTAIN GOAL followed by MOLD THEM MOLD ME MOLD THEM MOLD ME and a collapse for various reasons. I would cater myself to whomever they were, I depended on them for everything and cut other people out, I would manipulate or strong arm to get what I wanted using veiled threats, etc. 

I was rarely single. When I was single, I slept around or drank way too much, and pretended I was ‚Äúfree‚Äù and living life as the forces that be intended. 

I was spiraling over and over again. 

I found my current partner online. Or rather they found me. We have been together for almost 6 years now. As I continue my journey of discovery and healing with BPD, we get better. But a huge part of why I‚Äôve lasted this long when previously my longest (uninterrupted) relationship was 1 year... he gives me space. He does his own thing. But he never lets me forget I am important to him. He sits in his room (man cave) playing video games or watching YouTube and I can do my own thing. This has helped me a LOT in being able to find myself. I know I got lucky. It could easily have been just like all my other relationships. It certainly started out the same way, with me pushing boundaries and saying I love you way too soon. We had some really bad fights but I was open about my mental state right off the bat, even before I was diagnosed. Maybe that helped. 

My point is, sometimes you can have cake and eat it too. Someone who has enough sense of self and emotional intelligence can help support you while also giving you the space you need to find yourself. I have days where I‚Äôm like WHERE ARE U LOVE ME I NEED MORE LOVE PLZ and for the most part he gives me some attention or affection then gently redirects me towards my own (assumed? Fledgling?) hobbies or enjoyed activities. I also am REALLY open with him about how I can get and ask for help routinely."

I thought it was like FP means favorite person, some sort of thing related to BPD. You can probably stop reading this comment now, as the rest is just a personal soliloquy. 

I dissociate viciously enough on my own, so my knee jerk reaction was that I‚Äôd be scared to take anything that‚Äôd make it even worse. What would that even be like... I have like zero to little memory, as a defense mechanism to a years-long pattern of traumatic abuse and neglect, so I tend to be broken there already. The CPTSD from that is way too much memory as it is. 

There was a period (20-22) where I was mostly drunk or high or doing ether or on shrooms - mostly the year after my mom died now that I think about it - but that evened out. Now it‚Äôs just an episode of binge drinking every couple of months (35 now). My dad died this past August and I‚Äôm doing pretty well with not abusing or self harming or running away from my current boyfriend to be either one of those things... I did buy a crapload of THC stuff at a dispensary in February, but I haven‚Äôt used any of it since I started on a medication treatment plan maybe 6 weeks ago. I still get the urge to, though, even with the side effects THC gives me. (Itching, paranoia, dissociation.)

Maybe if I had known about the k hole when I was younger (and had more resources of that persuasion), I‚Äôd have sought it out. The more I think about it, the more there is an allure to what google overviewed. I want to not exist in my head - without the mental effort of dissociation or the paranoia that comes from THC. But I wouldn‚Äôt purely because of the illegality of it, I think.

I‚Äôd say lean into the animal connection. You could become a veterinarian‚Äôs assistant or (later) a veterinary surgeon. The assistant deals with animals for intake before the vet reviews them and you‚Äôre basically there to hold onto the cat or dog and calm it while it‚Äôs being examined. Dog walkers can earn a decent wage depending on which service you work for. A groomer also deals mainly with the animals, not people. 

As for other options... I work from home as a system administrator (a tool called JIRA). I don‚Äôt often have to deal with people, and when I do, it‚Äôs in small doses. You can get certifications online for a number of different systems and look for work from home options. House cleaners also work when people aren‚Äôt home usually, and it tends to pay fairly decently if you‚Äôre in the right agency/neighborhood.
