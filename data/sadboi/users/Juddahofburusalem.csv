Also people lie about our condition and we have a history of genocide. My life has been bad so far even in ""peace"" and I doubt it will get better unless I alone do something to change it. This because to them everything wrong is my fault. I'm tiered of being being beaten, bullied, starving, poor, etc. My childhoods only magic is based corporate schemes. Toys, T.V. shows, and other forms of entertainment is all that got me by. Other people really added nothing to my life. No breast milk, no early newborn bonding, multiple divorces, bringing in drunks and privileged siblings who will always have more. My parents are still abusing me and tried not to raise me once they learned about my autism. This is not wrong to NT's or regular people. I have been beaten and grounded casually at their tyrannical be-hence. I don't feel any love at all for other people because of my treatment. I only fear in what they will do to me. I just want love and shelter. But its not going to happen because of them not willing to help me. They choose to mistreat us no matter how young or senile they are. So why are we are held the social standards at the highest order? People can proudly ignore your autism for their own expediency even if yo draw attention to it. I'm not saying it HAS to be fair to us. But if it isn't, were allowed to dislike everyone for clearly not helping us or paying your dos. If you care then where is my mommy? When will the childhood bulling come to an end? Where is love in my life, do I get to eat good food in childhood, What about adulthood, safe shelter any point in life? I cant avoid the thought that my life really is a waste of life and time that should be someone else problem. NT's did too much damage in my life and they don't even feel sorry about it.

Though he does address this. Such as, using the vacuum of space as an energy source, nearly every mega structure, multiple intelligence's, warp drives, quasi drives, star lifting, anti gravity, directing gravity, having anti matter in high quantity, Immortality, blowing off atmospheres to make worlds more habitable using several USA sized mirrors, etc. Most Issac Arthur take one of these ideas and run with it. Fusion, at least on a small scale may not be possible. Or cold fusion might be real. He's explored both ideas showing the problems with each. Despite this many fans believe fusion will happen, simply because he believes its possible. These all problems and Issac Arthur explores those ideas. So are we. Sci-fi of all types and futurism are the main themes. This is place we can discuss it. Also I think we can both admit that both interstellar and the expanse aren't completely hard sci. They take push several laws of physics or rules and throw them out the airlock for story purposes.

Interstellar  has a worm hole that defies logic and the laws of physics and we see inside of as black hole. It also visits earth like exo-planets, multiple times. The expanse is littered with so much poetic licence that it ruined the show for me. The martin is an example of hard sci. But that's because it doesn't tackle any big problems.  The bigger your idea for a story the more laws of physics were going to break it seems."

AskScienceDiscussion,f56g7zu,t1_f55c42s,1572022838.0,"Its rational to mine anti matter over the other options given our scientific understanding currently. The reason why mining works better is because of your first point. Creating it is harder than mining it. It just takes too much energy to create it. However, we keep getting better at producing it every year, so there is still a lot of room for improvement in its development long term. The fact is that anti matter is found near magnetic fields including Earth. Jupiter and Saturn would have even more. This is because of cosmic rays interacting with its rings. When your doing a project like this it imply's mastery over space and developed infrastructure/technology to pull it off. When you have many gas giants being mined it adds up over time. Say one planet gives you 250 micro grams of anti matter per year. A common figure for Saturn's yearly anti matter production. Further more you have thousands of these objects being mined. At some point its not a neglectable amount of anti matter enough to make it not worth the investment. This is just gas giant mining operations, there are others proposed. And again, this is natural. We could maximize a planet or rig it for anti matter production if we were routinely mining it in the first place. Why wouldn't we? And we have alot of time to do this too. If we did this for billions/trillions of years traveling in all directions I bet you we'd have enough. Like I said time is the issue, not energy. We could one day produce enough energy to make making anti matter more feasible. Such as with fusion or ironically anti matter itself as the fuel source. But these are achievable right now. I will admit that right now it seems impossible but anti matter is everywhere. We just have to mine it. I stress once more that this is a long term hypothetical project that would take a long time of trail and error to complete.

My main concern in this post is attraction between anti matter and matter. Not energy or time. Your building an artificial area that's physically different than the rest. That takes time and energy. This is because the area its self could be moved buy other matter composed objects in the far distance. Similar to how a light log is carried by a river, this space would be influenced by matter near by. But how much distance is enough for the attraction to matter to take place or not take place at all? That's what I want to know. Because them's the breaks."
AskScienceDiscussion,f552wrg,t1_f55135s,1571998181.0,"You don't need the energy of a galaxy to make a star of it. Anti matter occurs in nature around magnetic fields and we can create it too. Its more efficient to mine it than create it. Time and containment is the obstacle not energy. Also we would need matter to start us out on this project. The Anti matter is contained by regular matter machines that emit a field to stabilize it or keep it in its own space. It would get hit by atoms or be redirected by other machines such as utility fog. The issue I'm concerned with is space need in total for such a project. Anti matter is attracted to regular matter, so what amount of distance do we need from regular matter do we need? ""Far away"" is a cop out I see often. But how much is unnecessary especially with technology assisting it? I suspect that we could contain it safely enough to make it possible for habitats, infrastructure, and  Imitation of planet's, nebula's, stars and so on. Its all man made though."

Disney+ will become the leading steaming service for a while as you get hulu as well, with Netflix in second place. The rest of the streaming services will fail or wont turn a profit to make the upkeep worth it. They will join the other streaming services or stick to tv. If apple, cbs, and other company don't do this they wont generate enough money keep it around. We only have so much money and shitty business practices will just lead me to cable, Netflix or Disney+, not evil corporation trying to turn a profits. These shows that we are seeing are just a marketing ploy that will fail because our wallet only go so deep. We will pick and choose over coming years what we want to buy. I really doubt marvel, star wars, and Disney movies will endure supreme forever. Fatigue, rescission's/depressions, politics and time will see its fall. Netflix might be able to rise again, but apple is not going to able to take alot of the pie with just a show that we might like. I'm glad to see someone else sees the issue with streaming.

A feudal society in space would be managed my a Nobel like class, backed by knights and serfs/common/citizens. So if you had a base that wanted to rule itself within fair means you would just absorb them into the feudalistic structure. The rebels have arms, citizens, and their own leaders. Space is dissent so there should be more than enough room for everyone to enjoy. You could just ask for tribute for the whole empire, which would help with diplomacy and trade between members.

It could turnout that rich people will reap all the benefits, while were lucky to take a shower once a month.

Of coarse the rest of the disabled, our friends and family's would have to be there to make our civilization work.

I never said crony capitalism and socialism were the same, you did. You are mis respresning my argument because you dont want to read my responese. Ill say it one more time. The terms are used wrongly in polotics. They are ideas. They are in academia. They are real things that are not good or bad. But in politics its used to throw shade on others ideas.  E.G. Crtony capitalism= evil capitalism E.G. Socialism = Communism.  Are you still reading? do you get it yet. SOCIALISM IS NOT COMMUNISM AND CRONY CAPITALISM IS NOT BAD CAPITALISM.  

If you read this you should see that your agruing with me over nothing I said. Your confused because your not reading your responding. Everything you say is wrong if you dont know what I'm talking about. Your telling me I'm an idiot in several posts. Your arguing with yourself. Everything you claim I support I don't. Give me break. How hard is it for you to be respectful to me or my argument? Can you at least re read my posts before you claim I'm an idiot whos making shit up and your a intellectual who knows better?

My gayness is more of a concern to the left currently than my disorder. SJWs have discriminated against me and left hasn't killed it yet. theirs an opposition, but its not enough to redeem the left. Last election our people were ignored in favor of mexicans, gays and the issus of blakc people. That fine. My problem is that it was WAY too much attention. Immigration shouldn't have been an
all encompasuing issue if there are real problems like health care, restoring rights, the internet and the homeless/drug crisis. I'm a gay and a white male to them my autism is ""savvant"" social quirk that can be ignored in conversation like race and gender. But thats bigoted. We arnet a race (yet) or a gender. I wish I could like the right or left right now but as you can see I dont buy that the left actully cares. I know you care because we are the same group, but as long as identiy poltics is in the left it isnt safe to support. Also autism speaks bad reputaion is an unknown to most people. I've never had a non autistic person be like. ""Oh autism speaks?
Yeah fuck them like WTF dude. Who does that shit"" They can be educated but so can the right. The left is not open minded right now 20/30 years ago mabye. Autism speaks needs to fall with both partys beating it down. The left is not the savior of our people.

Socialism isn't bad or good like crony capitalism. They are the same. They are an idea it cant be write or wrong only in how you implement it. Which is why were talking in the first place.

If you want me to support it perhaps you should feed and house me so that I value other humans and civilization. I deserved the right to exist and its not respected in life. Thus we should cut cliement change and focus on food and shelter. Again if you have a problem with it give me a place where I can live and not get beat abused or yelled at. Protect me and I'll care the planets well being. Still want nuclear power, with solar and wind as long term investments.

They are real academic ideas, but are use as slang by the opposite party to throw shade and shit on ideas. This may escape you because no else knows this ether. I didnt know it until I was educated by my economics teacher on those terms in tutoring sessions. A government can implement socialism without being socialist. A socialist state is an idea but I cant be done wholy. Not because of people but because of nature and technology doesn't allow it yet. One day, if thats what you want. But not now or anytime soon. Higher taxes are what you want because it allows you to create programes for those that need it. The problem is thats not socialism thats just left wing stuff. Socialism is used as a selling point of the left not the goal. Its shamefull but the right is same, so what can you do? So, support higher taxes and create programes. Thats what the left wants. the programes shouldn't just be socialistic becayse thats like mcdonalds choosing to be a non profit because it sounds the best. It might be or it might not. Socialism isn't a belief its a system thats implemented like in water or electric companys. Why have a completion over water if its better for everyone to have it be a monopoly instead? A water company being socialistic makes sense. But healthcare is dicey in hands of socialism not the left though. Cronie capitalism has its uses too in day to day life. All I'm saying is you want left leaning laws and programs because socialism was never designed to support civilization. Its a part of a greater whole. I hope you got this."

The left continues to support social justice and put our people down. Autism speaks is spoken fondly by the left still. The left doesn't give me free stuff or attention like they do for everyone.  The focus on mexicans, gays, and blacks is dishonest to them and our people. Its too get views and attention. Never once did the democrates during presidential election this past 4 years put our people in the light as a concern. Also by your reasoning the right can be forgiven based on personal experience.

Everyone thinks that. No one considers autistic people. Left and right wing are bad. 

Also we have to admit that the social justice movement is used against the autistic population at large. Until were viewed as people both party's will eternally be corrupt to me. I fear both and cant support any of there candidates. I don't think climent change matters if I cant live in society the first place. I'd rather destroy the earth because it never had anything to offer me. At least I could eat good food, be safe 24/7, have housing 365 days a year, and healthcare if we didnt spend money on cliement change.
