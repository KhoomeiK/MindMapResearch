Processing things takes time. You just have to do the work of processing it and it will get a little easier. Just the edge, but that's better than nothing at all."
ptsd,fm63vmm,t3_ft1ozj,1585785724.0,"Hello, All of that is relatable. Spot on.
I don't know if there will ever be a time of forgiving yourself completely, same with the regrets you feel. I still think and see some of my dead marines and I still feel an overwhelming feeling of one Marine who was mangled up from trying to kill himself. I was there for him and because of my actions I was able to save him to get him in a Jeep to be taken to the on base hospital. Even though I logically KNOW I did everything I could for him, I STILL feel like I failed him. I could've done more, I could've and should've done more for him.

I relive that feeling everyday. Sometimes I can just nod my head and get myself to accept I did everything I could, no feeling of regret because he lived. Other times that same old feeling and memory comes and it's that scene exactly over again and I feel all the regret in my heart and mind. 

I have short and long term memory loss and I don't think I'll ever forget that memory along with others.

You're not alone in how you feel of losing opportunities."
ptsd,flnall1,t3_fps9t8,1585314045.0,"If there is a friend close enough to you and you trust them, and you might've talked about what happened or just how you feel, ask them if you could hold their hand. Ask them if they're okay helping you get through it. 

I've never liked people touching me and especially after the Corps. But, I reached out to a close friend of mine and she was okay with helping me. I told her about some stuff and I held her hand for an hour or more just bawling and venting stuff out. Eventually I got comfortable enough to have her touch me, sit beside me, to hold me at some point. It took awhile, but I got there. 

I hope you have someone to trust and are close enough with that can maybe help you out."

Theater saved my life growing up both on stage and mainly backstage being a Theater Technician set design, building, lights, making the actors and actresses look great. BJJ, Kickboxing, Wrestling, Muay Thai, Tai Kwon Do even. I would say BJJ has given me the most calm out of all the sports and it has kept me the most grounded. 
He may or may not be up for trying it, but DnD! My friends and I started in 4th grade as a way to escape our situations at home/life. I'm 26 right now and somehow still alive despite the things I've done, seen, experienced both before and after the Corps too. 
He might break his hand like I did, but writing it down whatever happened. Getting a therapist that's right for him could do wonders like it has me. I've been able to see one since late 2017 and I wouldn't be around if I didn't find the right one for me. I still have sessions were we don't even talk about what's bothering me so much. But I have good and bad days with my therapist and she has helped save my life. 
I hope any information of mine helps a bit. 
What your brother is going through is Normal, there's nothing wrong with that. But, any of those things I suggested, could help because I was exactly like him until maybe 2015 of October. And I was Better by 2017, and I'm doing Okay now in 2020."

ptsd,fj4tqdr,t1_fj4tgss,1583016675.0,"Yeah. I used to be the same way, but you can live without it. I smoked because it relaxed me. With the meds, it did that, but then it would make everything else come out really bad. So unless you want to experience some crazy time and maybe a small stint at a hospital, don't smoke at all. Figure some others things out, I picked up BJJ and writing/journaling."
ptsd,fj4pgks,t3_fbgh3o,1583013745.0,"I would avoid smoking until you know how Rexulti effects you. When I first started my PTSD meds I was smoking and I had Worse/Severe violent episodes or breakdowns putting me in the hospital for a few hours or a night. 
Besides that take it as is and starting writing down your day at night. Reading back on how you feel and see what the meds are doing in a few weeks."
ptsd,fh89zkf,t3_f1lj0s,1581355271.0,"Everyone had said pretty much how it is. You go through the emotions first, anger, sadness, confusion, back to anger. I can't remember Jan 7th 2013 to Oct 3rd or 4th 2015 because I was blocking out things from the Corps. That made everything fuzzy long term memory wise and then a car accident gave me short term memory loss in 2016.
Reflecting on the things you Wish you could remember will happen a lot and feelings will resurface. It gets easier though."

The Demonologist was a really good read too.
All Secure was a good read.
The Women in the Window is an okay book too."

Overall it's been alright, just had to explain sometimes ""Hey, I haven't slept in a few days, and stuff isn't good up in my head. Any time I can get away from people will be good."" They don't really understand it, but they respect me for letting them know and that most days I have something going on but that's not going to stop me.
You'll do great :)"

I would honestly have to go with dissassociating, it can be because of something tramatic(Usually) and it's just how your brain copes with it. Anxiety and depression I also have and it's a constant balancing act.

I think it's similair here in Oregon, it was a treatment center/hospital to where the mental health was above the drug addiction clinic. I'm sorry I don't know much on the prison system to comment. Car accidents suck. 
Being suicidal or homicidal is something."
ptsd,eu11e2h,t3_ceacp2,1563358685.0,"Disassociating. I didn't lose nearly as much as you did, but I lost 2 1/2 years. It was like a ""Fog"" lifted, a ""Blur"". I went into a In-patient facility and it helped me get my bearings again. 

It was a Rough, rough begining. I still get extremely upset when I try to remember those couple years just gone. That was in 2015 of October. It's been 4 years now and I'm Okay at best.
But, doing in-patient might be a good option for you.

For me it was PTSD that caused me to Disassociate."
