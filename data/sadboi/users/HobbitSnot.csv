mentalhealth,fh1xt59,t3_f14dl7,1581227601.0,"This sounds like a bit of depression. You're experience a lot of fallacious thinking. Thinking things are true without any real proof for them. I'd really suggest looking into CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). It goes into why the brain has thoughts like these and what you can do to, over time, stop them from effecting your happiness. 

Realize you're not your thoughts. The brain can 'misfire' and start producing unwelcome thoughts. Its not your fault, and they're not true, its just how our brains work sometimes. CBT was a real eye-opener for me, and once I realized what these thoughts were I had a much easier time questioning them, and setting them aside. Its not quick fix, but they're a set of tools you can employ to your benefit. I hope this helps. I wish they'd teach this stuff in high school, it would help so many people."

The majority of the cedh community wants to keep playing EDH regardless of the ban list. 

I hope something happens with flash, because otherwise its just a lot of lip-service being given out by Sheldon to cedh players. Something has to go towards giving cedh players what they want for his efforts to be commendable 

I just think edh evolved more organically than you give it credit for. Its started off as a small community project that got larger and larger as time went on. Its always been Sheldon and his experiences shaping the format and its been very successful doing so. I'd at least wait till Thassa's Oracle wrecks cedh in practice and there's still no change before you start to bring the pitchforks out.
