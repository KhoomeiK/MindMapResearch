Their mortgage bank is not answering the phone and there is no guarantee theyll honor the mortgage deferral because we dont have documentation from the tenant. They're following the no eviction ruling of course and trying to work with the tenant on a payment plan but it's not looking good.

I know it's playing on the whole stereotype of rescuing the girl and them not liking each other first, etc. and then helping each other. but it's a fantasy after all. and sometimes ya girl needs a good fairy-tale fantasy story that's also engaging."
offmychest,fq38noc,t3_gd8uzi,1589064028.0,"I am in my late 20s and live at home with my parents because I'm also in grad school and work nearby and it's typical in my culture. I did move out for undergrad and moved back home for work and such.

It's fine and we get along, but working at home and going to school at home has been making me grumpy and I finally figured out why. Everyone is telling me to do something. Work is telling me to do something. School is telling me to do something. My parents tell me to do things. I do not feel a sense of autonomy and peace and I guess that's part of the tradeoff for living at home but the lines between work/school/parents are becoming blurred and I can't do it all mentally.

I clean up, it's not how they wanted it. I did a thing for work, it was wrong. I do my homework, it wasn't correct.

I need time off."

Bioshock,fq3614a,t1_fq18j90,1589063343.0,"I think I figured out what was bugging me - the stereo sound. If I turned away from Elizabeth or a radio or something, it would get SO low because it's trying to be realistic and while it feels cool, sometimes it's nice to hear what you need to hear even if you turn around, you know?

I don't know if I can change that aspect of the sound, but at least I know why it was being weird."
Bioshock,fpzarj5,t1_fpys1lj,1589015779.0,"Thanks. I'm enjoying infinite so far (just finished the hall of heroes part. I'm really not a fan of the Elizabeth bringing the tears for supplies and weapons...like...I thought she couldn't just do it all the time and there needed to be tears and also lol I can choose them? Makes it way too easy and I suck at games. And Booker can see them before too? What? Please dont spoil if this is explained at some point 

When I finished 2 it actually felt really meaningful. I think it was just slow at some parts. I'm really enjoying the story of infinite so far but the time tear help is annoying."
Bioshock,fpzagz1,t1_fpz4pd2,1589015657.0,Might get some good ones i guess

GirlGamers,fpyzlo1,t1_fpyt5sj,1589010979.0,Yes! Both are so dreamy.
offmychest,fpym74w,t1_fpy5v8t,1589006164.0,"yup. for over a year we thought we had 3 separate break-ins at the apartment. 2 roommates said someone was in their room at night. he would sneak in, they'd wake up startled, he's run back to our bedroom like nothing happened.

he all made us think we're crazy. the cops even came once. we changed locks. I mean, who would suspect him? He was a really good liar. We all trusted him.

He admitted it was him when he got caught with the camera under the door. I had moved out at this point for work (about an hour away) and he was living there with 3 girls. They were friends too. He was very ~women's rights~ and such. We all were fine with it. I trusted him. 

I found the secret camera on his phone about a month before. When I asked, he stuttered and said it was to ""record when his uncle would get drunk"" which I didn't buy at first...but I mean, you never want to think the worst, right? I worried he had been recording me secretly too, but when he spilled everything he said no. I hope that was true, but I did delete a lot of photos of me from his computer, so I hope everything was gone.

I had been with him for 5 years when the incident happened. It was quite traumatizing."
Anxiety,fpxy2qu,t1_fpx84i6,1588991947.0,"Yeah. His fault is becoming so wrapped up in it and not realizing he is not making any sense, even if he is repeating fox news he cannot hold a conversation when he's like that because he doesn't listen to you. I wish, even with his opinions, he wouldn't get so illogical and hold a discussion or debate. 

oh well, that's my dad. he cares about me so much. it's also hard reading about other people hating on people like my parents online. the divisiveness is insane and I feel guilt and shame for some reason. people aren't thinking of the other side as people anymore. like if they knew my dad had these opinions and thoughts they'd hate him even thought he's so very kind and loving."
offmychest,fpwvxkc,t3_gfug3c,1588970956.0,"my ex-bf had a porn problem I think. I remember I was sitting next to him in bed and realized he was watching porn. just watching it, not doing anything else. and it was one of those ones shot in public. I didn't think anything of it and was like, ok fine. sometimes I would watch too and defend it. I figured he was watching to try to get in the mood or something.

it kind of clicked when I realized how he was trying to get me to do things with him in public / in dressing rooms. 

we broke up because he ended up trying to take a video of our female roommate from under the bathroom door. I'm not saying porn was to blame, but I think he got so into it and wanted to more and more risky things like in the videos to get him off. he admitted to having a secret camera recorder on his phone for recording girls in public like they do in the videos. he admitted to sneaking into our roommates bedrooms at night for a ""thrill.""

I think porn and reality kind of got mixed for him. I think his pleasure response kept getting duller and duller from stimulation from more and more porn and he did those things to get the thrill. He blamed it on being depressed, but lol I'm depressed too. 

I think it was porn. When we broke up I made sure to delete all photos of myself off his computer and found hundreds of folders of porn. It was...a lot of it. We also kept getting notifications from our internet provider that torrents were being downloaded and the name of the files they included in the report were all...porn.

I used to defend it a lot too and sometimes still watch but am trying not to."
Anxiety,fpwvmk7,t1_fpwvcue,1588970797.0,"late 20s. I'm in grad school and work nearby, so living at home (also quite common in my culture). moved out for undergrad and moved back home for work and I'm still here. 

I know it's embarrassing but I see my parents as adults now with faults and it makes me sad."
offmychest,fpwvgg3,t3_gd8uzi,1588970708.0,"my dad is losing it. anytime he watches fox news I can tell his mood. anything they say, he drinks it up and later spews it at us. his hate for cuomo. him saying people who stayed at home got sick and therefore they need to open everything up. his logic doesn't follow. sure the survey results are surprising, but that's not the logical conclusion. you can't have a calm conversation with him. he diverts and sounds like the opinion commentators. 

my dad is kind and sweet but when he gets like this you almost dont' recognize him. I hate what it does to him.

We've had 3 major fights so far. all stemming from how easily he is influenced by sensationalized news. it makes me so incredibly anxious and sad because my dad is smart. he works at a major research university with scientists (he is a lab tech). I feel shame, for some reason. I love him, but I hate it when he gets riled up. 

His behavior is not the things he says but I've had enough. I don't know why I feel bad when my dad is like this but I can't help it because I wish I were proud. 

My dad has taught me the importance of hard work and doing your best, but that's it. I think it's from his soviet upbringing. he has not taught me how to manage emotions. he has not taught me how to be calm and logical. 

he's taught me how people can have crazy cognitive dissonance. I just didn't think it would be him.

I guess being an adult is seeing the faults in your parents. It makes me sad."
offmychest,fpwshjd,t3_gd8uzi,1588969156.0,"I hate that everyone assumes because I'm quarantined and working from home and live with my parents and sister, that it's easy. no one considers the fights that interrupt my work. no one considers that I get dragged into them. no one considers the politics and noise and other shit that comes up.

sure having kids are a distraction, but they're not fights and disagreements.

I love my parents, but I've had several fights already. I try to remove myself but sometimes I can't. And I just start crying from the frustration and stress of it all and I can't go back to work immediately. Sometimes I wish I didn't know the things my parents think about the situation or their politics. My dad gets riled up every time he watches fox news and you cannot discuss logically with him when he's upset. His opinions change whenever the news changes. He doesn't listen to reason or calm logic and comes up with whataboutisms and hypotheticals that change the subject and it's bonkers. He would be an ideal cult member. He used to make fun of my conspiracy theory cousin, but I think he's becoming one of them. I feel shame because he works in a research lab. 

I don't know why this bothers me so much.

Maybe I sound petty, but I'm sitting here crying trying to work."
