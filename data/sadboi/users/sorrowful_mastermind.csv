AustralianMakeup,f16rxf5,t3_d82q0h,1569221851.0,"I’ve been using the Kèrastase Extensioniste range for my hair to help with growth. It’s a 12 week program where you use the shampoo, conditioner, a hair mask and a serum and I swear it’s changed my life lol
Also the Kevin Murphy dry shampoo is great!"
IsaiahRashad,eyyc6py,t1_eyyazbo,1567579751.0,I saw her live too which is why I got a bit triggered at the original comment. Best show I’ve been to. Best live talent I’ve personally seen before and I go to a lot of shows. Look I understand what OP is saying about vocal talent but the thot comment sent meeeee
IsaiahRashad,eyy6zlf,t1_eyy2itn,1567573634.0,"I understand they’re both black women signed to two huge labels within the hip hop spectrum, but why do we gotta constantly compare and put one female against another? They’re both doing them. Both putting out different shit. They have different style, different personalities, and stage presence and sure as hell are different people."
streetwear,eyba2yy,t1_eyaljmu,1566979501.0,Go spend your spare time driving for Uber instead of trolling someone who doesn’t deserve it. Let your 100k a year make u happy.
AustralianMakeup,ey7l0cr,t1_ey7jn97,1566887775.0,That’s so annoying!
AustralianMakeup,ey7i8hy,t3_cvxk5m,1566884394.0,Stupid question but do you get to choose the shade of sample foundation?
AustralianMakeup,exsrrfp,t1_exsg1xb,1566554656.0,I just bought the new fenty hydrating foundation (even though I have oily skin) and so far I’m loving it and feel much more in my element now! Haha
AustralianMakeup,exsfylb,t3_cu9v9h,1566543197.0,"I got a sample and didn’t like it, then I went back for another sample just to be sure. In total I wore it like 7 times and I absolutely hate it! It sits on my skin in the weirdest way and doesn’t stay on my nose and forehead. I literally apply it and it disappears as I’m buffing it in right before my eyes. 
I found that it wasn’t giving me the coverage I needed, no matter how much I added.
I tried it with a beauty blender and a brush and they both didn’t do it for me.
I did like the finish though, I’ll give it that!"
SampleSize,ex5xihm,t1_ex5wnjm,1566034297.0,no it doesn't. i just distribute it and THEN wet my hands and continue rubbing it in. i don't know why that's just how i've always done it
SampleSize,ex5vazi,t1_ex5uxtb,1566032844.0,"I don't like to start with wet hands just so that I don't wet the soap dispenser or bottle so I think that's why I instinctively do this. I put the soap in one hand, turn on the tap, quickly distribute it and then wet my hands and continue washing. And wow I never actually thought about the whole process until this post lol."
SampleSize,ex4keg3,t1_ex4iif9,1566006243.0,Yeah. Like people who wet their hands first...(:
SampleSize,ewt4cbj,t3_cq14vw,1565740055.0,Interesting idea...

SampleSize,ewgrl0v,t1_ewffdwr,1565388750.0,I guess I have been hearing about a lot of incidents within this particular age group in my country and thought I should simplify it by cutting it off at 35

askwomenadvice,ew5yp1p,t3_cmy705,1565148612.0,"I was raised in a strict Christian household that forbids sex before marriage because a woman’s virginity is the most important thing ever... when I lost it to the guy I had been with for three years it felt really right. I felt like I was becoming a woman and that sometimes rules have to be broken because 1. My virginity or lack thereof doesn’t define me, and 2. Times are changing and not every rule applies to modern times.
I did feel a little emotional after it happened because for a brief moment I thought I had made a huge mistake, but I got over that quickly when I realised that I did it with somebody I love and whom I care about and who cares about me. It just made me feel like I was finally growing up."
Anxiety,evxs5iy,t1_evxs0d3,1564905045.0,I feel the same. I’m still young but I feel like I’m wasting my 20’s being an anxious person. And I don’t see a way out.

melbourne,ethgy60,t3_cbh8kr,1562815209.0,"Why does a group of 18 year old guys packed in a Holden Astra think it’s cool to speed up to your car on the freeway in the middle of the night while it’s pouring down rain, and drive the same speed as you, and then speed off and then slow down to match your speed again and then keep speeding off? The fucking rain was already distracting enough."

streetwear,eq9q61o,t1_eq9psm8,1559915014.0,Yay :) I mean the only thing that’s super pricey are the shoes which can be switched out for anything similar. But then again docs are worth the money.

streetwear,eph87dw,t1_eph1pj6,1559223531.0,I heard that using a hair dryer on the back of docks helps relax the leather. Maybe it’s because mine are the vegan leather and they’re a little more flexible?
