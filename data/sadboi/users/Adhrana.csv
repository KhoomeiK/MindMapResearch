Ask yourself what you really want. Do you want this place to crumble or to get better and shine? If the answer is crumble, then it's a better focus to build something more ideal in its stead than to passively hope for its demise or not care at all. Being sick of it all is understandable yet not warranted at all. All it does is deplete the reality more by expressing sickness and having other depressed people chiming in saying, ""me too."" What does it solve?

Think about all of the apathy in our lives for a second. Very few people give a shit about anything or ever even try TO try. Virtually everyone thinks politics is irrelevant or hopeless yet want to bitch about the resulting oppression from not caring. It's a Little Red Hen mentality. For this, most live a ""life by default"", being taken advantage of by vultures, whenever we sit and just take from a society, act immaturely, and wave sucky little wands around.


Think about the mentality and unity it would have been to create the Taj Mahal. Allow some intricacy and refinement into your reality. Look at some pictures of it as a throwback. Find some inspiration and a way upward in your mentality. It's no threat to anyone else to sit and be depressed and get more depressed.

It's time to take initiative, take steps up in the progression toward universal inclusion, the elimination of poverty through combatting oppressive regimes with ""official"" (governmental) marketing campaigns, and fight the wars within that need to be fought. War doesn't get us anywhere, but sitting defenseless and acting futile to change anything only ensures we have less tomorrow than today.

Every time we sit and trade with these already OWNED bills of our own bondage (the US dollar is one example), we support all the precise shit you're sick of.

Set a goal, find some land, pay off the asshole selling it so you can keep the peace, stay up all night learning and researching, build something new.

I am a driver and a rider. As a rider, I think you should ride guiltlessly with Uber. Our problems aren't yours individually to fix.

Just, if you can, tip exceptionally well if you get friendly service and a good driver. $5 goes a really long way; $10-$15 on a long ride.

If you're in a market with ridiculous rates (as evidenced by paying $3-$4 for the ride) or if a driver came to you from more than 2 miles away, tip a minimum of $5.

In effect, if you just pay what you think is fair in terms of value received, everyone will benefit. Consider how much you used to pay for a cab and go with that. The service is BETTER in most instances, so why is LESS being paid.

Over 50% of the people I know living in poverty won't even apply for school (to get PAID to go) or won't take a trip down to get food stamps to help themselves eat, all due to a lack of self-confidence, incorrect presumptions, and/or complete depletion. Those are both earned and allowed characteristics. Look at our national voter turnout relative to the 100% of Americans who bitch and moan about ""the system."" It sucks here right now; that's a fact, but our useless commiserating makes it worse, not better. We need to look at what is good. To me, the law and legal system is a good. And I feel it is very accessible even if there is a bit of a perceived barrier to entry. It is largely self-imposed, however.

Once everyone has exhausted their efforts to receive what is freely available, then we can start talking about legal accessibility. Nothing is accessible when people are so intent on making excuses that they'll use any bar to promote the unfounded notion of impossibility.

I am low-income myself, homeless at present actually. There have been challenges beyond belief, and I've experienced some of the worst ends of injustice and elitism. And yet still, even after laying my head down in a rental car at night for months on end, I still don't think there are any excuses in life until the point to where you are disabled or mentally ill.

I see so many people becoming their own demise and stubborn against any advice to change their own circumstances. Because it's far easier to complain than to get up and do the work.

Fear is never a justification for not doing the just or right thing, especially if it's for yourself. And remaining ignorant or illiterate is always a choice.

I think we have a VERY solid legal system in America. Even the most perfect legal system, however, can't enforce equity for us as people. The legal codes are here so that we have a framework, and it is not required to be an attorney at law to access it; that is an illusion. Just as no one is going to come up and shove a computer in your face and force you to learn, no one will do that with the law either.

A disgusting degree of privilege is present in our society, but it's not so present that it preempts us from putting in extra effort for however long is needed to improve. At least some element of privilege is usually earned, but jealousy will block us from seeing that.

Is privilege in America equitable overall? Hell no. But it's no excuse for giving up on ourselves (or on changing the structure.) Not fighting just ensures the squeeze continues. I'm not a fan of the ""what about the single mother working fast food?"" hypotheticals for all the above reasons. I grew up with one of those, and she made it up with dedication."

Even if it means learning how to self-represent or finding another avenue/arrangement out of court, I have a hard time feeling sorry for anyone save for the most exceptionally burdened or incapacitated. Just your average ""poor person"" is not barred at all from representation, just education.

So many people give up before they even try to start and then come up with this ""injustice mentality"" that tends to propagate. There are known issues with legal access for sure, but in most instances, there will be an attorney to take any good case on contingency.

Though there are exceptions, the legal access excuse is often just pure laziness or the choice to poorly prioritize. Similar to ""technology access"" in a first-world country.

uberdrivers,f27ksxz,t1_f27hg5d,1570040454.0,"If you intend to settle yourself, the demand letter is the common format. You'd collect past wage statements, attribute missed work to property damage, claim an amount, and submit.

A person can still demand pain and suffering even without documented injury, so you're very quick to say ""there's really no injuries."" Even momentary pain/dizziness/distress after an accident is a form of injury. This is what I mean by being very prudent with what you say.

The medical damages still consist of you getting diagnosed at the ER; that's potentially compensable. Someone could also very validly claim that property damages caused missed work, so that's potentially compensable as well.

Your insurance company likely already paid for your car repair, and now I understand the arbitration element. Your insurance company must pay for your damages because you had valid coverage; they will subrogate it (collect from the other company) themselves.

The deductible is something you would have paid though, so someone would consider putting that as a recoverable loss too. (You wouldn't have had to pay a deductible if the other person never hit you!)

Even if they only agree to a portion of this, it's all about dollar amount to both sides anyway. The fault/liability determination becomes just the basis for settlement. In a trial, a party would likely assert 100% fault on the adverse anyway.

In other words, if I offer you 50% of $10,000 or 100% of $5,000, what's the difference? If they're saying 50/50, you could always try just ignoring that element and asking for a much higher pain and suffering allotment. This is all up to you in how you craft a demand.

An attorney may be able to negotiate a better settlement for you. In many cases, they don't, but it just makes it easier for you to deal with too. Good luck.

Common demand letter formats include a line saying ""FOR SETTLEMENT PURPOSES ONLY"" as to not agree to their determination of fault. Why even make mention of it if they just want to settle anyway. Just ask for what you feel is going to get you the amount you actually want."
uberdrivers,f27gq2o,t3_dcc04q,1570037847.0,"OK. I'm not a lawyer so not qualified to provide legal advice, but having been through accidents and being a paralegal student, I can provide some lay information.

I am not sure what you mean by arbitration in this instance. Typically, state laws will provide for a 2 year statute of limitations in a personal injury claim that will allow you to recover if you can prove the elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, causation, harm, damages.

Most motor vehicle accidents, all that's tough to prove is evidentiary fact that pins liability on the at-fault driver. You probably need something more than two sides of competing testimony in order to recover. That all depends on the circumstances of the accident: where they hit you, what they admit to, etc. The ""truth"" is often bent here as both sides often want to have the other found at fault no matter what!

Arbitration is not something I have run into in a fault or liability determination by an insurance company. My inkling is that you are misusing the term unless you actively waived your right to trial as part of a settlement (which it doesn't sound like you did), nothing would come in the way of you seeking attorney representation.

In most instances, if personal injury is involved, the path is clear: get a motherfuckin' attorney now and don't even speak with the insurance vultures who are going to contort your testimony and evidence into their best light in order to deny your claim. They effectively use you to do their own discovery and then make you file a lawsuit after they've already built up a defense. This is how they poise you to settle for a much lower amount.

If you've already given recorded testimony, a lawyer may not even want to fuss with your claim unless there have been serious injuries.

You could gather what you have, note what you've conveyed to the insurance company, collect correspondence, and approach an attorney to recover on contingency if you have a viable claim. (It sounds like you at least have an injury and property damage, so it's worth approaching attorneys with.)

I recommend Avvo.com as a starting point. Make sure you are prepared to contact an attorney with specifics though. Vague questioning for a specific event doesn't go very far. You need to be poised to sign a retainer or fight the insurance company yourself (probably a losing battle unless you're confident representing pro se.)

It isn't some big deal to get a lawyer like it is made out to be. It's very common. If you have something to recover and don't have working knowledge of the law, you probably need to have one!"

Stop being a victim of circumstances you actively created through inertia and paths of least resistance.

One of your big problems I see is having big problems that don't actually exist. Your comparisons to other individuals and their successes are causing you to be mucked up in a circumstance of relativity.

The point of getting fit is to make your experience better, not to superficially look good so you can gain a prize (someone else). You're inherently entering relationships from a vampire perspective because you actually have revealed that you do not think you are worth it and are seeking someone to feel that you are. You will NOT be in a position to grow with that other person because what you're proposing is an exchange of loyalty (to her) for a sense of worth (from her). That is not a fair deal for either side.

Here's the truth: you ARE worth it. But you need to see the authentic you underneath all of the piles of emotional dirty laundry and shit in order to clear things up emotionally.

Try these things:
* Focus intensely on hygiene and purifying your surroundings. Clean shit up immaculately, organize everything meticulously. (Why do you think the military gets off on this? It allows you to mentally carve clear pathways and create order. You need this.)
* Take care of your skin, your nails, your hair, make sure everything is feeling good: pick one layer at a time and tackle it all. Organize YOU.
* Next, pick the worst FEELING part of your body. Make sure that feels good. Don't worry about overall fitness yet, just separate it into one component and focus there. You have to listen to your pain and your body and stop ignoring it telling you ""we need to move.""
* Build something. Be a cause. Start a website. Put yourself out there. Actively participate. Be filled with invigorating energy, not laze and an ""I'll do it later."" Putting something off is not completing it: it's delaying it. Do shit now always.
* Do not focus on a mate. You are not ready. Actively decide not to focus here, remove the apps, take some time away from the angst of rejection vs. acceptance, and date yourself for awhile.
* Realize that your mentality is subjecting you to rejection, so you need space to change that and prove self-acceptance to yourself before others will be able to follow suit. You're going to inherently be a drag on others, not because you're making that choice, but because you're not asserting self-sovereignty and standing for much when you're in such a vulnerable space. It inherently becomes all about your woes without you realizing it.
* Love yourself. Be gentle in your self-talk. If you wouldn't blurt it out to yourself, do not send those chemical signals (emotions) into your body. It collects like garbage because what goes in comes out in your reality through the filters you're composing. This is how emotions create chemicals which create lenses upon the contents of what you see. Sick emotions = sick reality.
* FUCK other people. No, not literally yet. Or maybe literally if you feel like it. But you need to be a statue in order to grow beyond the constant hurdles of competition. Realize that this world has become very hostile, like it or not, and there is always a MF'er trying to take, break you down, etc. You need body armor without developing/furthering a hatred, disgust, or deadly ego.
* Find friends, ignore or emotionally neutralize enemies. If someone doesn't support you, they are NO GOOD for you. Either help them grow alongside you or cast them away. Do not let others sit and suck off your motivation and vibe.
* Do not allow your ""worst voice"" to define you as a loser, shithead, or even overweight. You're just a weight; over and under is irrelevantly relative. Health/feeling good is the important part, not the stupid, semi-diagnostic, quasi-medical label that becomes like a scarlet letter for people.
* And lastly, don't just take this shit with a grain of salt and do nothing. Change. It's time. Because you're either on the up or you're on the down. There is no not choosing.

You don't need luck, well-wishes, good karma, or anything of the like. All you have to do is to figure out that you're worth it like I know you are. We all have problems that we can overcome. Sometimes we just need to be told how shit is.

Ultimately, you will have to take your OWN word for your life, not mine. I'm not in control of it. Your power is yours to take back if you want it: 💥⚡️✨

If you're not worth it to you, who else is going to be able to make you ever feel that you are? No one. Certainly not to any degree that's going to actually GIVE you motivation. Certain things are unable to be given.

And one last reminder: Not all of life comes in pretty, pristine packages by manufacturers. Sometimes you gotta simply be raw as fuck, fuck shit up, blast through mounds of bullshit in one single breath, and reconstruct literally everything in order to blow past all the garbage thinking and emotion.

We're effectively something that's been made of nothing; it's a miracle we often overlook. We're living inside of what could be a dream of divine proportions, but feels like a nightmare because of the lenses we employ and the deteriorating state of the bodies we are residing within. Most of us want an intimate relationship in the first place just to feel a sense of rootedness, safety, and self-appeal so that we can spin another spin on this living, breathing biosphere.

The gift I can give is to reveal to you that you are capable of finding all of these components of meaning within yourself so that you are living something far more magical than a narrative of external validation as a metric of personal fulfillment and success. It isn't the immediate way to Love, but it is the way that doesn't fall apart when the another person invariably does not ""make you feel"" loved. (This is always a falsehood because no one can ever actually ""make you feel"" in the first place. We always choose our lenses and to whom we give our time and energy.)

The objective can be setting yourself up for success, not ultimatums. Instead of ""I'll never have anyone to love me because of these labels of flaws I've given myself"" (depression and anxiety), try ""Yes, it's a mess in here right now. I can feel that, and it won't be a secret to anyone else. But fortunately, I still have the clarity to see who I am and what I am capable of. It would be amazing to have another person who I can give to and who could feel and be sensitive toward my often brittle and fluctuating emotional states. The benefits of being with me far outweigh the inconvenience of some of the problems I experience at times. I have to and will learn how to be present for that person and adapt what I express to be fair and recognizing.""

This sets more of a two-way street into motion, and it is at least is the start of setting a manifestation template that isn't guiding you toward your own proof of failure as many of the ""prove me wrong"" depressive outlooks tend to have. You can build off of this and shift it into something that gives back to you instead of one that draws energy away from you.

If you set a wheel in motion like, ""I am worthless"", everything in your reality is going to magnetize this notion and emotion, and it's all because you let a distorted lens cover your eyes momentarily. This is when it becomes important to self-purify and start to realign those personal lenses and filters to bring you back to a place where you can see yourself as worthwhile, loved already by nature of existence and purpose, and so certainly able to be loved by someone else experiencing what this all is too,

This is what rage is: when you have held yourself hostage emotionally to other people around you being able to fix your plight, but if you look at this reasonably, no one can fix it. You're holding others to an impossible standard.

Here are some things to look at and start to think about:

1. When did my life lose purpose and meaning? What hand did I play in allowing that to occur?

2. What can I do for myself to make my life FEEL better that would be constructive for me? Maybe it doesn't make the most rational sense, but there could be some type of breakthrough or big change that part of you is just dying to make.

(b) Maybe this other individual simply is not equipped to absorb or process this line of thought and emotion and has been trained to see therapists as ""society's fixers"" and the ""bearers of burden"" instead of their actual role as caring people who are themselves trying to get by in the world with their own flaws, lack of hope at times, and personal psychological issues.

Part of having a psychological problem is simply being alive in this time period. A lot of things on Earth suck: biological discomfort, hyper-competition in society, lack of purpose or meaning beyond superficial gain, extreme wealth division and greed, and all of the other things you've identified.

Depression is one of those subjects with similar symptoms that hits everyone differently. Each time the pain of it does hit, it can be a little better and a little better until it becomes less effective as to the means of altering your more protected worldview of redefined personal meaning.

The only way someone is going to get any type of relief from this is to change the worldview and the filters by confronting them head-on. There is no easy way, but there is a way. A suggestion I have is to begin to analyze your passions early on in life and return to them. Do not feel as if you must spend your entire life conforming to a social template that doesn't serve you. It may be an element of your life, but it isn't your life itself. You are defined by the metrics you choose to define yourself through."
