Got so bad that I just had surgery on my finger to save it from having to be amputated as it was basicually dead (they were able to save the majority of it and they knew about this, told everyone from my manager to head office). I had a phone call about an hour after waking up from surgery with my forearm that had been cut open to repair my tendons so I was casted and slinged up and unable to use thst arm for a few months (doctors orders or it could muck up again) but they didn't want to hear it and kept threatening my job whist I was trying to recover and be able to have use of my finger cos if I didn't then my finger wouldn't work properly. On top of PTSD and other mental health issues this really made everything worse, so when I felt up to it I went down there with all my paperwork from surgery and told them to fuck off. Because of this I haven't had a job since this incident thst was 6 months ago and I'm kinda scared to go back into work.

TLDR; had surgery on my finger so it wouldn't be amputated, work kept threatening my job, made my mental health worse, boom told them to fuck off.
