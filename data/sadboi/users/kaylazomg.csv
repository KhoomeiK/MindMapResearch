Short version. Decide what it is that you truly want and desire. If your desire is in conflict you won’t know where to turn. You have to commit to change and commit to your desires. If you’re struggling it must mean you don’t want health bad enough. Only when you become fed up with the negative effects of binge eating and suffering is when you’ll decide to make a change. I made my changes because I believed I would die if I didn’t heal myself . Now I struggle a little more because I’m surrounded by temptations living with family and I’ve progressed my health to the point where I no longer feel like I’m dying so of course my motivation isn’t as strong. But I swear once I move out it will be 10x easier to maintain my healthy habits. It’s just really stressful with family and I go back into old habits."
Psychonaut,fr1pla1,t1_fr0j7bv,1589823786.0,"I’m glad I know your point of view. It’s understandable that people would look at such studies as religion when all they know in their western society is such rigid views of religion. Those teaching from the Buddha and vedas, Hindi is not taught as dogma, and there are of course followers who think of it as dogma because they don’t understand the teachings. Alan Watts teaches from eastern studies like zen and Buddha it’s all the same teaching so I would say you still are learning from the ancient texts because Alan Watts is just the teacher of what he’s gathered. Alan Watts encourages you to seek your own truth just as a yogi guru or Buddha would teach you. They are not organized religion they are teachings to guide you on the right path but the goal is for you to find your own path it is not to say this or that is the right way they want you to practice discernment and experiential knowledge so you only come to a conclusion or wisdom based on your own knowing and experiences they do not say believe with faith and that’s it haha they want you to question everything. I understand from a point of view if you didn’t understand something you may have the incorrect idea of what it’s about (: understandable.

I don’t study these things as a lost follower but as a curious soul to seek knowledge beyond what I’ve perceived yet so I can then eventually apply and test these knowings to my own experience and determine my own understanding and knowing (: yogi and buddah mosty talk about how to quiet and master the mind so it’s really a psychology of sorts to help you"

Personally it’s my purpose to empower and help others realize their truest power and potential in self love and compassion/empathy. I hope in my lifetime I will see Psychedelics legalized globally as it is a HUMAN right to do this.

The wound is where the light enters to heal you. I can only attest for my own pain and life experience it has brought me healing and more prosperity by exploring the pain and the healing and how to help others in my own unique way with my life path. Regardless if you choose to leave it in the past and do nothing with the pain the option to let the light enter the wound and heal you is there for you friend. I hope you find the path for you

You can only be and do your best and see where it takes you.

You want to be the best because you think that is what’s waiting to make you happy and good feeling but really you need to seek alignment and get that feeling with source your natural state of being a joyous vibrational being and then things flow from there.

If you miss the window of feeeding them really pungent greens they probably won’t eat them haha. I would experiment and don’t give up. You can try masking the veggie flavors with other more familiar flavors. The other day I made yellow squash and zucchini with delicious spaghetti sauce (with onions meat mushroom bell pepper etc) and it was so good! Maybe they’d go for foods like that? Anyway you know your kids best and I would say still keep on trying to slowly change the diet because they won’t one day wake up and say I love plant foods hah they will continue to eat the same diet and eventually experience weight problems and other issues and after a life long of unhealthy eating it’s really difficult to make those changes!

Support each other and have compassion and care for your own and others health and it should be easier with support. You don’t need to change all at once just try to replace those carbs with a veggie instead . For example instead of grilled cheese you can do steamed broccoli and salmon instead of pasta and sauce you can do zucchini yellow squash and sauce. You don’t need to eat grass to be healthy lol but i found that replacing carbs with veggies to be the best option for health for me
intermittentfasting,fq70ggi,t1_fq6ywki,1589140187.0,"It’s actually lucky if you like your food plain because it means you can find the food meals you actually DO like and just stick to the same things. You have to get curious first to find out what you actually do and don’t like and don’t be afraid to not like something. You never have to eat something you don’t like. For me it’s very hard eating veggies because I am not used to more earthy flavors I’ve been hyped up on sugar and carbs 90% of my life so it’s been a slow process introducing new foods. I’m still iffy on new foods and I often eat the same veggies and meals over and over because I know what I like. Meal prep is huge deal for compulsive eating so you can make a bunch of one thing and separate it into meals for the week. 

Start with just one change at a time you do not need to do a 360 change with your diet. This never works and always fails. Change is done overtime not all at once. Introduce one new veggie a week and start there. Or try one new meal a week"

In a perfect world I would do more of a 18 hour fast but recently I’ve  been less consistent with IF because my brain is scattered with other things haha I’ve been recently focused more of calorie intake so just listening to my body intuitively how much to eat but that’s a dangerous game if you overeat like me.

Luckily I gained weight over time and lost it overtime so I think naturally the skin adjusted. With sudden weight gain the skin might have to overcompensate for expanding and that’s where you get the stretch marks. Every body is different so it will react different I think. Cbd cream is good but I mostly used lotion and I was not religious about it in fact I rarely used lotion haha but even though my belly was big I think the stomach has a lot of extra skin and room to grow because of the organs that expand

I couldn’t tell you all he does because when I’m there working out I’m just trying to not die LOL I do as he says and I try to push through it. I’m so grateful for people like him who seem to know exactly what to do with me and which muscles to work on and I don’t have to think about a single thing except surviving the workout. I came into his gym last month having lots of pain in knees and arms and he will adjust workout based on pain problems. The biggest takeaway I’ve learned was to warm up body with cardio, can be as short as 1 minute hard core or 3 minutes average speed (skiier bike or rower) and magically my joints and things are less likely to hurt or whatever. We typically do warm up maybe some mobility some strength and maybe some cardio mobility at the end it just varies a lot, but I am completely clueless to workouts and he seems to know all of the various things you can do with a workout haha"

intermittentfasting,fq6omcz,t1_fq69fe0,1589135551.0,"Generally yes the nuance differences don’t really matter the general idea is you’re unable to control your eating habits and you end up eating more than you need and often unhealthy foods. They’re all caused by similar problems, emotions being coped with food. Personally I have a ton of anxiety from childhood I haven’t healed fully but it’s all a journey of healing. For me food is my happy place where I can get lost in the food rather than my anxious feelings it provides me a sense of relief that I can make it to the next moment of my life, of course this is completely unhealthy and a coping mechanism that needs to be adjusted, but often very difficult to change. There is a lot of failure involved and many people including myself will feel frustrated at the changes and go back to binging. It’s all a learning process with yourself and giving yourself compassion when you lose yourself in your old habits. That way you can move on from the mistake and continue on your journey"

awakened,fq5025k,t1_fq28n69,1589088505.0,"Here’s my personal experience and belief....looking at the past should be done once you’ve become enlightened enough in unconditional love and connecting more spiritually with your true nature so that you have a higher vibrational state to handle traumatic feelings and emotions as they arise and are possibly triggered or habit of thought in the mind. I wouldn’t purposefully go into the past because you’re only creating suffering by identifying with the past trauma. If you can come to a point in your journey where you can accept what happens and even give it compassion knowing that pain led to your awakening then you might be able to move on from negTive thinking and not hold your self in that state of suffering. 

I typically only look at my past when it gets triggered because the point is to not be triggered anymore if you know your true nature you won’t identify with that past suffering anymore"
intermittentfasting,fq4zr1x,t1_fq4z3z4,1589088261.0,I admit I still struggle to this day with compulsive eating but I’ve slowly lowered the number of days I do this and the amount of food eaten and the type of food. Most of it is just keeping out what you know you will eat during a binge so I try to never buy goodies because during a binge I might go crazy.

intermittentfasting,fq4woz8,t3_gguwpc,1589086018.0,"So I started my journey last year after a major surgery February 2019 I was at my worst weight for over two years around 200 lb and only manage to lose 20 lbs and gain it back again. This year I was determined to change over time. I knew it would be an uphill battle especially due to a horrific surgery I was in the worst health of my life I couldn’t even walk. 

The most important step of your journey starts from within. You need to find your reason WHY you need you find your motivation in your WHY. You need to look at yourself a year or two from now where do you want to be and what SMALL steps and habits can you do to slowly but surely get there? 

I have slowly been introducing a more plant based diet into my daily routine and I try to limit my snacking and binging with meal prep and cooking vs buying instant or processed foods when I’m hungry. I have been slowly introducing a new menu into my diet so the old foods are naturally kicked out of my diet. I do not buy carbs and sugar because I know I will eat them! 

If you find yourself making a poor habit or health choice DO NOT guilt trip yourself! It never works. BE CONSCIOUS AND AWARE. stay present when eating and ask yourself if you need the next bite or if you’re over eating. Ask yourself if you really need that snack or if you’re trying to ground anxiety with food. Give yourself compassion because change is HARD for the ego and accepting the hardship is the first step and the second step is compassion. The next steps are more of a loving step to give your body nourishing foods. 


For exercise I found little progress with going to the gym everyday I barely felt any stronger after months and I knew it was because I had no idea what I was doing. I’ve recently hired a personal trainer and within 1 month I already feel more strong now than 6 months of gym. I highly recommend hiring professionals to help you on your journey. There are health coaches for you to help introduce new habits and health changes and uncover underlying beliefs that may be holding you back from your goals and personal fitness trainer can guide you towards your goals without you feeling clueless as to how to get stronger


YOU CAN DO THIS YOU ARE STRONG YOU ARE A MIRACLE OF LIFE SO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE AND HONOR YOUR BODY AND LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF MORE AND MORE AND ENJOY YOUR HEALTH JOURNEY

Exercising regularly and stretching + meditation all helped curve the nausea. When I start eTing poorly or not meditating or not exercising I tend to feel icky again. I also have acid reflux sometimes especially when I eat too much, too late, or processed foods"
awakened,fnambts,t3_g0aurp,1586799974.0,"I’m in the same situation. It’s really a challenge to stay high vibration and positive when my family who is terrified of the virus and negative energy is always around always making me feel guilty or worried about leaving the house for any reason, always putting on the news to fear more and more. It comes down to the ego being terrified of dying. I can sympathize but I wish I weren’t here absorbing all this negative energy it’s really hard work to make sure I stay separate from the energy and cleaning my aura and plus it’s snowing outside and so I can’t escape in the backyard anymore T.T"

Psychic,fn3l79v,t1_fn3b22v,1586622967.0,It’s funny because they prove the above is correct. Their perception of the shooter is someone separate of themselves and bad. They must also see themselves as separate and bad for their wrong doings. Once we see our selves as one then we can see the love and light within everyone. We are all connected but not all of us are awake to see it. Our source within is love and light and the body and mind we have the joy to experience can be the default and the controller or you can come t with source and see your body and mind is only a manifestation of who you really are. Consciousness wanting to experience itself and learn uniquely from your individual souls experience. We can see what we don’t want easily but the true experience is staying true to self which sees the god/love/creator in everyone

spirituality,fmfq8eb,t1_fmflq2r,1586032583.0,"eventually I can detach from needing their love to fill me up because I’m doing this for myself, although it still hurts to see people I love suffering and it makes me want to give give give so they don’t suffer anymore.... I think this form of giving is attachment based because I need them to be happy in order for me to be happy, when they are not happy and not loving themselves it makes me want to fix them by giving them my love I guess and then with this I’m no longer focusing on loving myself I guess which then I become depleted since I’m not filling my own cup. 


So let’s say I detach from needing their love and focus on loving myself... with overflow I know I can give love away but I seem to always feel disappointment when this love isn’t received in the best way or when they continue to not love themselves it feels like I’m wasting my love on them since ultimately they won’t be happy with my love if they don’t love themselves.... I feel like I’m wasting my love on a brick wall and what I desire is to be in a family or partnership where we both focus on loving ourselves and filling our own cup and with overflow we love each other however I know people aren’t perfect and we sometimes have our dark moments and when I can shine as a light of unconditional love it can help inspire others to love themselves but then I go bCk into that cycle of my love not being good enough for them to change or be inspired to change and be happy and then I feel down and sad that they don’t love themselves and they can’t love me



Edit: tldr: I can’t help but to feel hurt everytime I’m not loved back or everytime someone I love chooses to be unhappy instead of being happy and just loving me 

How do I end that?"

Psychonaut,flw8i0d,t3_frad0f,1585542576.0,I had this experience not tripping but meditating (with weed) on love and becoming more conscious and aware of my true self however for some reason I can’t FEEL this love in the same way sober maybe I’m rejecting it I don’t know but It still feels like I’m alone even though I’m thankful the universe is there to love me it doesn’t feel enough at times

spirituality,flt6jym,t1_flt652o,1585460880.0,"I’ve just realized how my pain & suffering in this particular situation could potentially help me better grow my love for more people and empathize with those who struggle with the same. I know this will have a long term effect of knowing and compassion but I guess I’ll have to suck up my fear of confronting the truth and open myself up. 

I feel like I’ve closed myself off from spirit because I feel shame, fear, and anger. It’s been so hard to let these emotions go because I’ve been identifying with them during my experience. 

I have been feeling some time now that I neeed to purge myself of my fears and anxiety. I want to detach myself from my ego, see my life experience for what it is so that I no longer give my power away. I still live disempowered because of my experiences and I avoid taking responsibility or my power back.


I thank you so much for your words and experience that led you here to help me."
spirituality,flt3tnu,t1_flt2hh5,1585458404.0,"Thank you so much for your long message I know you understand. 

I know my soul’s purpose is to heal myself and then help others heal and awaken. I chose this path because it’s the quickest way I thought to manifesting this path of getting my business going. Now that I’m here I only see a couple learning opportunities like speaking up, not caring about parental judgement, and possibly just finding out this path deff. Isn’t for me.  I don’t really see the soul benefit for staying I only see the 3D survival purpose but then I’m not really thriving because my ego is being hurt by my decision to go through this experience. I keep thinking why did I do this to myself? Do I not love myself? I keep thinking I must love myself enough to suffer? But what ups the point be in to continue choosing suffering in this particular situation I see no more benefit other than survival. The other situation I may suffer as well and possibly will learn something different, maybe learn I can do it and overcome my fears or hatred of the other path....


I know I’m afraid, very very afraid. Maybe I needed to learn how to stand up for myself with whAt I truly want and who I truly am? I am not this person right now and it feels like I’m living a lie and I’m not sure if survival is going to benefit consciousness if I feel like I’m hurting myself 


Sorry if I’m repetitive I understood a lot of your message but not to the point of being like “I know what I need to do now” haha. Karma Yoga you say?"

Psychonaut,flmkk2k,t1_flmk9oa,1585286434.0,"Yes I’m not saying adhd doesn’t affect us I’m saying the diagnosis itself makes people feel helpless most of the time. Most psychologists have too much western training and they have no idea how to help adhd. Meditation is probably #1 best thing but there are eastern ancient philosophy that could be more beneficial and neurosciences and behavioral psychology is probably more helpful than stimulant meds. When you get diagnosed you’re usually told you have 1 option and you’re stuck with the uncontrolled adhd brain. 

With diffferent approaches to adhd diagnosis we could help alleviate the bad habits or behaviors and mental disorders that often pair with adhd

Western medicine often focuses on treating not curing or getting to the root cause of something"
