sex,foxc3em,t3_ga2cdn,1588139564.0,"I read your original post and what she said was absolutely disgusting and toxic. There is no reason to shit talk your partner behind their back, much less when they are in the next room.

However, I went back to your original post and looked at the age of you two, you both are young. Now, that is still no excuse for what she said. But young people do stupid things. Especially when drinking. From my experience girls rejoice in shit talking their partners to each other as ""girl talk"". Even if what they are talking about really isn't a bid deal or a deal breaker to them/in the relationship. I did it when I was younger (I'm 29 now, still learning and growing) and looking back I'm like what was I thinking. Girls (and I'm sure this can be applied to guys too) see this ""girl talk"" as harmless venting to their girlfriends when in reality it's the opposite. You are still trashing your partner. You are giving people a negative imagine about your partner that may not be able to ever been undone, no matter how good they truly are. Yes, we all have problems and complaints in our relationship. But in my opinion you should never shit talk your partner to anyone...family, friends, a random internet stranger. The more you shit talk your partner the more you normalize it and maybe even begin to believe it. People need to find a way to express there frustrations about their relationship and partner without deducing them to nothing.

I'm never one to say just throw the relationship away because only you truly know your relationship. You never mentioned if you two had any prior relationships (I'm just wondering since yall are young) but she needs to learn to be open with you. You seem like you are a rather receptive young man. I do understand telling someone about their body is always a slippery slope because you fear damaging their self esteem so I can kind of understand why she may have not said anything. But regardless she should have never talked about you behind your back.

From your update she seems remorseful and owning her mistake. You are undoubtedly still high on your emotions and made a smart decision to give yourself time to sort through things. She is making an attempt to show you she still cares and you are important to her. Do your best to keep your heart open. You know what is right for you and what you can handle.

I hope you have a happy ending not matter what happens."

sex,foelrcs,t3_g6ywzs,1587707214.0,"Let me say this first. I don't have in general have a issue with porn.

But...porn can be a slippery slope sometimes. 

My boyfriend is bi. I knew this from the beginning. He doesn't have and has never had any emotional connection with a man. He really just enjoys being oral with a man more than anything. In the beginning we would watch porn together during sex, and I was okay with at first. However, our porn interests didn't really line up. They only really lined up in one or two areas and the times we would compromise and find videos that had things we both liked in them one of two things would happen. We would end up severely drifting more and more towards videos his liked, ones that really didn't do anything for me. Not that I found them gross. I was just indifferent to them. OR I was left feeling like he was paying more attention to the video (or finding the perfect video) than he was to me. It kinda felt like a rabbit hole and honestly it made me doubt and feel bad about myself. Was I not enough for him? Did he have to have porn to have sex with me? It slowly developed into a small disaster. 

Eventually I broke my silence and we had a many discussions about how we both were feeling. At one point I said something a long the lines of ""You seem so invested into the fantasy that the porn is presenting you that you can't be enjoy what's in front of you."" I felt like an asshole saying that, but it's how I felt. I never want to be the female to be like no you can never watch porn! But it was damaging our sex life and quite frankly our relationship. He agreed and admitted he had some form of addiction to porn. He said porn felt easy because he could live out his fantasies without risk. Without risk of disease, and without risk of judgement or shame. Especially relating to his bisexual side. I told him I understood, which I did. Especially with the bisexual side of things. But I said ""I support your bisexual side. But you have a me, a female, in front of you. I'm willing to let you have free rein me. You can live out your female fantasies on and with me."" 

*Note like 98% of his fantasies are nothing insane or unachievable.* 

I told him I want you to be able to be in the moment with me and enjoy the human connection of sex. Because in my mind it far outweighs porn. Especially if you have an emotional connection with that person. He started significantly cutting back on watch porn and masturbation (I never told him to cut back on masturbation, that was his choice) and our sex life and relationship improved greatly. It actually felt like he enjoyed having sex with me without having to have outside media. I felt like he was enjoying me and I wasn't competing with something on the screen. 

I know he still watches blowjob videos and things relating to his oral bisexual side. He's admitted it to me. I have no issue with this because I can't fulfill that for him. 

So you have to dig deep and ask yourself why you are bothered by your boyfriend watching porn. 

Porn can be a great asset to your sex life and relationship or hindrance to it. 

Unfortunately there is no just black and white on porn being good or bad."

You may also come across guys who say they want to date a plus size girl, but in reality just want to have sex with a plus size girl. I could go into reasons/opinions why they do that but that's a rabbit hole for another day.

 I have a boyfriend now, and we are going on 3 1/2 years. But when I was in the dating scene boy was it weird. First off your flooded with choices and mostly you base it off a profile picture, then a profile if they even have one written. Most were on there for sex and not much more even though their profile said they were interested in a relationship and something serious. You'll get left on read. You'll have people show interest and then leave. You'll have people who talk to you for weeks and you'll start to connect and plan for a date that never happens. It may even happen more than once with the same person...I was dumb enough to let it happen. You'll go on awkward dates that just don't go anywhere. You'll maybe even just find a good friend. 

I always seemed to find my relationships in the most unexpected ways outside of dating websites/apps.

Yes, it still gets to me to a degree, but  to be sexual with someone in any form when they aren't into (even though they are 100% consenting to it) is a crappy feeling. 

Be honest and just tell him how it made you feel so you can get it off your chest and then move on. Don't harp on it, unless it becomes a common occurrence. And try to read him a little better before initiating or putting on lingerie.

DeadBedrooms,fnf9kus,t3_g1645g,1586903931.0,"I'm seriously not trying to shame you at all. But if you noticed the issue starting to arise after the engagement then why did you follow through with the actual marriage? You could have just had a long engagement while trying to figure things out. 

Anyway...did anything change in her life when you noticed things changing? Stress, possible signs of depression, anything? As someone else mentioned in one of your other posts birth control may definitely have an effect on her sex drive. If you do decide to change birth control though proceed with caution (which may mean condoms for a bit if she switches to a new birth control) because I don't think it would be wise to risk bringing a baby into this right now. A baby won't fix anything...it will just compound the problem. 

Also, do you happen to know if she has any trauma related to sex or sexual acts? It doesn't necessarily have to be something like sexual assault. Even just being shamed about sex, sexual acts, and your body can be severely damaging. If so she may want to see counseling. 

And of course there is the option of going to counseling together. 

At the end of the day she has to be a willing participant not only in sex, but in your marriage. She has know, understand, and value that the lack of sex isn't only hurtful in a physical way, but in an emotional and psychological way for you as well. She has to know that sex for you goes beyond just ""fucking her."" 

I'm never one to say just immediately throw a relationship in the trash because things are hard and there are issues...welcome to a relationship. Do your best as team (hopefully) to get to the core of the problem and begin to fix it. If she refuses then it's up to you to decide how much you're willing to put up with and for how long."

AskRedditAfterDark,fncc2qe,t3_g0u56z,1586833182.0,"Fellow big boobed girl who has nipple piercings.

The comment about nipple piercings looking good on only small boobs is totally subjective. 

If you do get the pierced as someone else mentioned the healing period is anywhere from 6 months to 1 year; each person is different. Mine were probably healed within 6 to 8 months but I substantiated from vigorous/rough nipple play for probably over 1 year. 

It will hurt and there may be a little blood. To me the piercing itself wasn't horrible (again each person is different) but the first few days to maybe a week after definitely hurt and was uncomfortable at times. Obviously follow the piercers aftercare instructions. I found it helpful to wear a bra or bralette to help keep your boobs from moving to much. Plus I would take a piece of cotton gauze and fold it over maybe one or so to stick in my bra over my nipple to act as padding and to keep it from rubbing. For me once I got past the first week the pain subsided significantly.

The most important thing is following the aftercare and cleaning to make sure they heal properly. If you have any questions don't be afraid to ask a professional piercer, that's what they are there for. And just asking doesn't mean you have to commit to getting them. 

I had my nipple piercings for about 9 years. Around year 4 or 5 I had to take them out for a surgery and forgot to put them back in and had to get them redone...so technically I've had them done twice. 

Also apparently so people pierce one nipple at a time...so there's that too lol."

I'm sure you already know, just make sure you keep your mobile devices full charged (if you have a power bank for charging phones charge that too) and have access to a radio incase power goes out or download a radio app if you don't. I believe 102.9 FM will be the WTVM weather broadcast if you do lose power.

A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for a tornado. Tornado warning means one has been picked up on radar.

ColumbusGA,feeie2a,t3_emm5yy,1579034368.0,"I forgot to add this on my original comment but if you do head over to Auburn don't hesitate to check out Opelika. Especially downtown Opelika. They have two breweries and a distillery there. Resting Pulse and Red Clay are the breweries, John Emerald is the distillery. 

I've been to both breweries though it's been awhile for Red Clay. 

Resting Pulse has excellent beers that to me are true to their style. 

Red Clay has good beers too and at one time had an excellent cider, but I'm not sure if it's still on tap.

Last I knew the distillery did tours and you got samples during the tour. Things may have changed though based on laws. 


If you like ice cream, right around the corner from resting pulse is O Town ice cream. All there ice cream is made in store and some of the best ice cream I've ever had. 

I'm still learning Opelika myself and places are constantly popping up there so ask around if you do venture up there.

Cheers!

**I keep adding stuff I've forgotten. 

There is a winery in Warm Springs called Warm Springs Winery so if you are ever up hiking Pine Mountain you could stop there."
ColumbusGA,fdxo7cg,t3_emm5yy,1578771168.0,"Don't count out the Cannon Brewpub!

Cannon is hit or miss on beers for me. They do have some good seasonal beers. They will gladly let you sample any beers on tap before you buy. Personally I love their burgers. Especially the pimento cheese burger with tomato jam. If you pop in during the week the brewer will most likely be at the bar and if he isn't busy will gladly talk with you about almost anything. The bartenders are always nice. They are doing construction on the front of The Cannon so it may look closed but it isn't! 

Personally I like the atmosphere of Omaha, but I know several people who worked there (not just bartenders either) and they all have left so I'm not sure how it is now. 

I just can't get into the beers at Chattabrewchee. Super nice people though. Bf is good friends with the brewer. 

And I'm just picky about beer in general. I like sours and blondes

I'll try not to repeat others on the food.

Southern food: People rave about Minnie's, I've only eaten there once and it was good. I think the people who own Minne's also own a place on the north side of town called but I can't for the life of me remember the name of it at the moment.

Italian: People rave about Treviolis. I haven't made it out there yet.

I think everyone else has covered many of the other good places to eat.


As for music...sadly we are still coming up in that area of the arts. The Loft does have open mic night on Wednesdays and live jazz on Friday's. Sometimes Scruffy's will have a band playing on Friday nights. If you want to venture out head over to Auburn and I guarantee you will find more live music. Ask the college kids! 



**Oh on Saturday mornings on Broadway in Columbus they have market days which run from 9am-noon and there is always cool vendors there from food, to jewelry, coffee, etc.

If you have Facebook you can search Uptown Columbus page and they usually list events too."
