college,fhdkjq6,t1_fhdjtcv,1581489439.0,"Thank you! 

I really enjoy teaching people, and often I feel that lecturers and tutors are dismissive if you aren't up to par. Sure, it's your own responsibility, but if I really see you try, I'm gonna make sure I try my damn best to help you as well. Sometimes you just need help with something small, a concept you missed or misunderstood, which impacts several later topics, and causing you to have no idea what's going on. 

So even if you feel it's a stupid question, ask me anyway. It may sound stupid now, but it could be fundamental to your understanding and learning experience later. Clarifying it now means that I don't have to re-explain 5 chapters in the future (but if I have to do that too, I will, let's find out what you are struggling with and resolve it, it's actually just a giant puzzle with a few missing pieces). 

I honestly just do what I would have appreciated as a student myself, and I know varsity is hard and scary, so I might just as well be someone that they can approach, a mentor kinda vibe. Often fields are competitive as well, so previous years don't really want to help you out (or charge you a hella lot for it), and your peers judge you for not being up to scratch, or whatever, and then you hate your field in the end. 

Learning is not about doing well in it, that is the end result. Learning is about truly enjoying it, finding it fascinating, wanting to know and understand more, having fun (even when it's difficult), and then you do well by default. 

I also have ADHD-PI, I'm perfectionistic and I have a large fear of failure, so I know the struggles of not being able to sit and learn something. If it's fascinating and I explore it on my own and really want to invest, I do well. If I catch a snag, and I hate it and I have no idea what's going on, I'm not going to put in all that much effort because ""what's the point, it's un-understandable, I'm never going to be good at it, heck this, just get it in your head for the test""."

Just make sure you're not disturbing anyone and don't get robbed. There are students that take a nap on the lawn over lunch/off time, there are several students sleeping in the library, and we actually have people bringing blankets and pillows over exams, studying, sleeping under the desk, and then studying further."
college,fhdj9bo,t3_f2jvyo,1581488144.0,"I used to tutor a group of first years, and we also had shitty markers. I couldn't afford new ones, so I just struggled on with the ones we had. During the fourth week of class one of my students said: ""Hey, catch!"" and tossed me a new marker, and it was so much appreciated. 

I had a weird dynamic with my class though, I'd walk on the table and sprint across the room trying to explain neuronal pathways, used memes all over the place, I made a WhatsApp group with them where they could ask me/peers questions, made them shitty MSpaint drawings (I have zero drawing talent) to explain stuff, and brought them pizza (three pizzas of their choice to accommodate different religions and food preferences or aversions) at the end of the year (small class, they actually did their work and always attended class and was overall very nice). 

I still get some of them that text me now and then three years later, the one is becoming a writer and poet, and the other is now doing HR, they've referred friends and classmates to me to tutor them privately later, they've borrowed my old class notes and summaries of later subjects, and thus far it's good. So while I'm not on a professor level yet, as varsity tutor I can say this is very highly appreciated. Having a good dynamic with your lecturers never hurt."
