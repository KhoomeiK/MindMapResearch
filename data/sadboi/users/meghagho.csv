depression,fqbyrbh,t1_fqbadmd,1589246589.0,"same, but right now i feel so alone. no person ever can make me feel alive in this world? why do i feel like i just have myself? There's literally no one there for me ngl im legit so lonely and can't help to just feel dead every second. I just study with a blank face on like im just dead to this world. i feel like i wanna disappear in an instant, but my parents are here so i gotta be 'here' as well."
depression,fqbvuol,t3_ghn1wd,1589244930.0,"i feel like we aren't alone, but we are in reality. Although we all are struggling, theres no way out unless you find something or have a realization. Its like we are in the same storm, not in the same boat i guess. Thank you for your words and hope you find your purpose."
depression,fqay8cu,t1_fqal08b,1589227336.0,"yes i haven’t killed myself because my parents did so much for me to live, i can’t die either. it’s the circle of life."

depression,fq5jmsa,t3_ggenld,1589107931.0,"hey, i’ve also had bad shit—we in the same storm. i’ve been failing everyday at doing simple tasks and even failing to TRY to do shit. i would say that to compete. you have the power of competition in your hands and use that to drive you to do something to better your life. they can’t have gotten better for 4 whole years, they had some negatives and positives in the mix in the middle. there’s a chance you might give up easily because it’s hard to get “better” when they had a head start, but make your goals and plan your future in the now. live in the present to make sure they see that you have gotten better. but the most important thing is—don’t think about others too much. if you got better, don’t base or compare their success to yours because everyone improves at different rates. focus on you—although hard i hope you can focus on your success and not theirs. you can use them for motivation if you need it."
depression,fq5j96o,t3_ggx4hs,1589107531.0,"hey, i’ve already failed at so many things in life as well dw there are many people who fail. it’s common to. but the main part is to find something you can succeed in, if money is the issue maybe you could get a part time? there’s online tutoring too. i feel like i’m a failure too, my friends are friend ish? i feel like i don’t have real friends except for music and a few people:/ i’ve realized in life, social life doesn’t matter. as long as your confident about your own life and worried about your future, the people will come to you. your future can be your best friend—or music. i’ve never had friends in my past, but i hope you can connect with someone in the past or someone you briefly met. you haven’t failed until you have died. if you are living, you can think yourself as a failure, but then your already dead :l i personally have been stuck in the past—feeling dead—but i realized i had to live in the NOW use your time because the cost of time can not replace the future regret you will face."
depression,fq5iprq,t3_ggqccd,1589106943.0,"it’s ok to feel lazy, to let it be, to not do any of those habits. it’s ok to let your thoughts give you a bit of happiness if it helps. it’s always to try to do them, but my bro said this “saying is easier than doing”. there’s no way to definitely keep that habit or discipline. every night, i can’t help to just lay on my bed thinking do i need do it? do i need to brush my teeth? wash my face? it’s self care, but you don’t force yourself to do them because you aren’t motivated enough to take care of yourself, bc pain makes gain. but letting it be and giving yourself a break is good. it’s good to not do any of them as long as you say to yourself that you will try one day. hopefully that one day gives a spark of passion to keep doing the habits. maybe think of the end result that it could make you feel more better or comfortable or even productive. dw ive been feeling this way the past few weeks and i really can’t get out of bed because i feel no life anymore. although i’m studying, i feel like i’m feeling nothin or just crying oof. although life isn’t ok, at least you can take time to feel lazy and rest ok."

depression,fnyrg0w,t1_fnygvr8,1587372853.0,no problem :)
depression,fnydkcr,t3_g4dslm,1587359980.0,"bruh, ive felt your emotions like 24/7. Its the factor of regret in your mind constantly and the fact that more bad things keep happening to you. Every single day, I try to do something positive or right, but It fucking ends up to be a shitty day. I legit just balled my eyes out for getting a 94 on some fucking chem thing while my bro got a 100. I legit hate the fact that the past hits you even more. I feel like in your situation, there are so many events in life that aren't working for you and same for me as well. I wish someone was there for us i guess. I gave up on hope, but i hope for you to find a big positive in life if ya get lucky. Even if we have good things, doesn't mean we are happy with our life. dw im a useless piece of shit too, im on the same boat as you. The way I found short term happiness is listening to music so I dont stay sleepless. make sure to take care of your health. Ive realized ive gotten more stupid by cryin way too much--alone."
depression,fnyc0jk,t3_g4czr4,1587358733.0,"A very happy birthday to you! :) People have never remembered my birthday as well. Don't worry, if you have the power to not think about others and possibly get to the point where you are content with having not many around you that is great. I used to be very alone throughout my life, but I have changed myself in college--although I'm still getting used to having ""people"". I hope I can remember your birthday next year :) Make time to adore your time alone!"
depression,fnmf81f,t1_fnkapws,1587070349.0,thank you for this reassurance :) you are loved as well ;)
depression,fnk8nyk,t3_g25d4t,1587018379.0,"yes i have tried about 10 or more times in the bitter winters of minnesota, but i’ve tried to think of oh what if i do better what if i can show off i did something more than normal? that never happened. i’m still the same me. everytime before i try i think of what if i found someone who loved me or was curious about me or asked questions to me. no one is fascinated about me, i think my friends are too in love to care anymore. it’s always been me to make things happen or to try to get convo goin but if i test others to talk they all go silent. it’s always me asking questions or being curious about their life. i don’t think anyone even knows my life? there’s no one who truly loves my past future or even present. failing at suicide is basically the future coming to kill your thoughts. what if’s statements always kill suicide bc it is hope—false hope for me. i’m glad to be alive to listen to music at the most."
depression,fnk87wl,t3_g1wr6o,1587017971.0,oh my. i’m really sorry man. my twin brother told my parents he was extremely sad and we both have been i don’t think my parents know i’m really sad as well. but now he is switching to TAMU to get away from the college i am in. i have friends but i’m sad. i have money and everything but i am not good enough for society. i’m glad you were honest. i feel like i’ve been a lie to my parents but they handled my bro well enough so he doesn’t feel like suiciding. i’m left alone in the dust where people assume i have everything and everyone when i don’t. i hope you can take this chance to see that telling your parents is better to live with honesty than to die as a lie.
depression,fnk7ray,t3_g1zjib,1587017550.0,"personally, i feel like i give out too much emotion from myself to hide the fact that i hate life. i’m smiling, but dying inside. literally when i give myself up to others i think that’s the best way to die even tho i’m living. i’ve just spent so much time giving love and i feel like i’m never going to receive love. i know the one i love will never love me back. i’ve been on a relationship with a guy for about 2 weeks but every second i was thinking about another guy which hurt me more that he liked me and i didn’t"
depression,fnk7eii,t3_g21ii7,1587017228.0,"yo i cry so much every night because I literally can’t handle life—it’s been goin on for 4 years now. ngl i think i’ll try this too bc i can’t let my parents and friend hear the pain i’m literally crying out. omfg it still hurts to live everyday to the point where i cry, but there’s so much pressure to stop crying that my brain almost explodes. i want someone to help me but at the same time i don’t want anybody, mind as well die one day. it hurts to hear music that seems so normal but excruciating at the same time"
