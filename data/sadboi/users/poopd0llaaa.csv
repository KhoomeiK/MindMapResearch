Students work at own pace to complete it. So there is the flexibility there. I also have a google meet once a day for 20-30 mins. One to go over work, four others are flexible. I’ve been doing games and other activities. Perhaps you could do a Friday fun day meet? Math games on Kahoot or other platform?"
ElementaryTeachers,fr1jxju,t3_gm12r4,1589821018.0,Oh no. Chaos in a classroom is never boring. Consistency is key. Students crave a set schedule. They have enough chaos going on at home they don’t need any more.

Shower at a decent time. Then I do my skincare routine, medicine, brush hair and teeth. Drink water throughout. 

Plug in my cute light up unicorn diffuser. Not too strong of essential oils but a slight flower scent. Makes me happy and calms me down. Plug in my white noise machine to block out my screaming neighbors and focus in on my thoughts. 

Stretch. Whatever is sore. More water. 

Then I read a teaching manual. Boring but works. 

Focus on my breathing. Four in and four out. Warm up next to cat.
