Hyperhidrosis,ewq3hfj,t1_ew9xr6t,1565655914.0,"Apologjes for the delay. I tottally feel for you my dude. I grew up with bad sweating on my hands and then it started to transition to armpits but the face is where I get it the worst now. Like somebody noted, it's the emotional and mental toll that it puts on a person. I've always had anxiety and my social anxiety got really bad to the point where I couldn't take certain paths because I didn't wana see people.

So your thinking is tottally right, the root of the problem is the anxiety. I went to therapy for literally this specific condition and it was a struggle at times because my therapist who was actually really good would always touch on the point that accepting it is the key to feeling somewhat good about this. Through CBT methods and looking at it as not as the enemy, I was less able to get less depressed of this ""flaw"" I had. One thing that helped me is putting myself in really uncomfortable social situations where I basically know I'd be sweating and one of the reasons I did that is after reading this book, https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Ways-Anxiety-Panic-Attacks/dp/9090305262
Definitely helped a ton and I recommend it to EVERYBODY in this community even for those who don't have anxiety induced sweating like myself.

The real change though started to happen when I was consistently meditating. Unfortunately, I've had to take a break from it because of vertigo case I've been dealing with it so I was actually put on Lexapro until the vertigo is cleared up (I can let you folks know how that is). But with the meditation is where i started to notice a real genuine effect. You start to see your sweating problem as not the enemy anymore and you in a way transcend into it. Meaning that you become one with it and you sorta embrace it as who you are. 

This results in caring less and less about when you do sweat. Slowly, you evolve into not caring as much and you start to sweat less. But that's not the goal though, if you need to not sweat then there's always going to be resistance and that's going to be a problem. Try meditation (Headspace), some CBT methods (online), and reading that book. I'm curious how you respond. Please let me know after a few months how you're doing! :) best of luck and I'm still sweating but as long as you can feel better about it, that's all that matters!"
Hyperhidrosis,ewq09ae,t3_cpehuf,1565653616.0,"24m here. I tottally feel for you my dude. I grew up with bad sweating on my hands and then it started to transition to armpits but the face is where I get it the worst now. Like somebody noted, it's the emotional and mental toll that it puts on a person. I've always had anxiety and my social anxiety got really bad to the point where I couldn't take certain paths because I didn't wana see people.

So your thinking is tottally right, the root of the problem is the anxiety. I went to therapy for literally this specific condition and it was a struggle at times because my therapist who was actually really good would always touch on the point that accepting it is the key to feeling somewhat good about this. Through CBT methods and looking at it as not as the enemy, I was less able to get less depressed of this ""flaw"" I had. One thing that helped me is putting myself in really uncomfortable social situations where I basically know I'd be sweating and one of the reasons I did that is after reading this book, https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Ways-Anxiety-Panic-Attacks/dp/9090305262
Definitely helped a ton and I recommend it to EVERYBODY in this community even for those who don't have anxiety induced sweating like myself.

The real change though started to happen when I was consistently meditating. Unfortunately, I've had to take a break from it because of vertigo case I've been dealing with it so I was actually put on Lexapro until the vertigo is cleared up (I can let you folks know how that is). But with the meditation is where i started to notice a real genuine effect. You start to see your sweating problem as not the enemy anymore and you in a way transcend into it. Meaning that you become one with it and you sorta embrace it as who you are. 

This results in caring less and less about when you do sweat. Slowly, you evolve into not caring as much and you start to sweat less. But that's not the goal though, if you need to not sweat then there's always going to be resistance and that's going to be a problem.

Hyperhidrosis,ew9txc0,t1_ew9kokm,1565231098.0,"Meditation has helped me with the rush and panic that comes with it. I definitely recommend that as the long term solution. In the short term, try looking at the sweating as not so much the enemy but instead a tweak that you've become comfortable with. This will help change your attitude completely. Deep breathing is key in social situations, this will help cool you down. And nothing wrong with wiping the sweat off your face, I do it all the time :)"

Obviously your condition is not as intense as mine but I am understanding where you're coming from on this. It's hard to describe even for me who's dealt with it."
