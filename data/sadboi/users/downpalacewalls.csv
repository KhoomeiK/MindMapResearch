Breath_of_the_Wild,f77p93s,t1_f77n8m0,1573469089.0,"Bullet time! Learned something new!

This new glitch is currently known as the bullet time bounce. It requires players to jump, turn 180 degrees until their back is facing the enemy, and hit them while riding their shield. There's only the smallest catch: the enemy in question needs to ragdoll when you hit them.

My fingers lack in coordination but your execution is flawless! 
Thanks for the info!"
