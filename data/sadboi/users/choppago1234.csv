AnxietyDepression,fl5y63p,t3_fm2jw8,1584848833.0,"Drugs aren‚Äôt the answer and will lead you down a very dark path especially if you have anxiety and depression. I smoked weed from freshman year of high school till about 10 weeks ago and now I have anxiety and bipolar disorder. I also popped percs and took xans for awhile during my time in college. I found myself in a bad place and had to leave school and my life isn‚Äôt exactly where I want it to be but oh well. Here‚Äôs why drugs will ruin your life. 

1. If your using drugs at a young age your more prone to bigger mental health problems like schizophrenic issues and personality disorders which are both very serious issues. 

2. Pills and weed make anxiety and depression worse for long term. These drugs might make you feel amazing at the time but they will make you feel shitty the following day, week or month after using. All this shit about medical weed is bullshit. It‚Äôs just a business that wants ur money and doesn‚Äôt care about your mental health. Once you get ur med card or your legal marijuana, no one checks in to see how you are feeling they are just looking for you to come back and buy more. 

2. Drugs are insanely addicting and you will find yourself in a rehab or dead. Rehab isn‚Äôt fun and it takes hard work to get off drugs.

3. You won‚Äôt find real people who use drugs. People use drugs to escape reality because they can‚Äôt face life or themselves. Your life will become fake because your not living a full life your just high all the time and it will catch up to you. You will also find yourself more lonely than ever because the people your surrounding yourself with don‚Äôt care about you but only care about the drugs your bringing to the table. 

4. I understand it‚Äôs a self coping tactic but your better off getting real help with good drugs that cure mental disorders instead of creating them."

AnxietyDepression,fiw6wbh,t3_f9zb2a,1582776685.0,"I was on fluoxetine and it actually increased my anxiety and depression. I don‚Äôt recommend the medication, ask your doctor for a switch of meds."
Sober,fhzo62f,t1_ffb2ddm,1582005326.0,4 weeks clean now. Picked up some new healthy hobbies and my anxiety and depression is becoming manageable now üòÅ
AnxietyDepression,fhznxo8,t3_f5mpf9,1582005108.0,"1. Quit that shitty job, find a job that intrigues you and that you might enjoy or could be something new.

2. Be KIND to urself. 

3. Don‚Äôt let inner voices control you because it leads you down a slippery slope. Trust me I‚Äôve been there and have finally dug myself out of the hole. Currently in rehab so I‚Äôm working on it but so far so good. 

4. Wake up Kick ass everyday. You are in charge of your destiny not a little voice, coworker, customer, or boss. You are there to chase a bag (check). Don‚Äôt let people get in the way of your money. 

5. Lastly you can become a nurse if your willing to work hard for it and go the extra mile. Many people fall short in life because their priorities aren‚Äôt straight but, focus on the big picture and knock the little stuff aside and view life as a game that your in control of and something you are going to win at. 

Good luck üçÄ"
AnxietyDepression,fhzna34,t3_f5cvrg,1582004512.0,I can never stop thinking about the future lol I was just thinking about it 10 mins ago. I try to focus on the present cause that‚Äôs the only thing you can control. The Present creates you Future in other words
AnxietyDepression,fhqgyem,t3_f4dsbl,1581804032.0,I had a bad trip once and it lead to worse anxiety and depression and I‚Äôm still recovering from it. I was basically fighting demons
AnxietyDepression,fhhxekj,t1_fhgi0wd,1581613642.0,Because I was getting bad side effects and my doctor let me go do to weed addiction that I‚Äôm working on. Currently 3 weeks clean but I‚Äôm thinking about tryna a different medication. I just hate the weight gain.

AnxietyDepression,fco90y0,t3_ehxna3,1577826491.0,I feel the same way my parents are starting to trust me again after I‚Äôve had to go to rehab and my actions basically destroyed my family. My parents are control freaks and didn‚Äôt plan on me being a fuck up. I suggest moving out and living your own life. Parents create negative energy sometimes and won‚Äôt ever understand what goes on inside their kids heads. Anyways stay away from drugs they will make things worse.
AnxietyDepression,fbdiwma,t3_ecsy0k,1576763478.0,I‚Äôm in the same situation as you. I take a mood stabilizer on top of an antidepressant so weight gain is common. And with all meds weight gain is  common. I hate when others call me fat or point out that I‚Äôm getting bigger because I can‚Äôt help it. Make sure you are exercising though because on top of eating well burning calories And fat is important. Lastly love yourself and don‚Äôt think about others. Try really hard to be comfortable in ur own skin and kill your mom with kindness so she will have nothing else to say. I learned this after trial and error.

AnxietyDepression,f6kr8ss,t3_drrjbl,1572918736.0,"Yeah I feel the same way. I think I‚Äôm bipolar sometimes or have an personality disorder because or my anger, guilt, discontent, mood changes and etc. It‚Äôs fucked up though cause your life 100% changes when you figure out these problems and people also treat you differently. That‚Äôs why I hide it and escaped by using substances for the longest time and it eventually got worse, but you live and you learn. I just still haven‚Äôt found the right meds either which makes me think I‚Äôm bipolar."
AnxietyDepression,f4sl8aq,t3_dlndbs,1571778564.0,You definitely should cancel upcoming meetings and immediately see a different doctor. First things first you should see a physiatrist and have them prescribe you a medicine if your feeling like this. Doctors are supposed to give you insight on how to deal with these problems. Strategy‚Äôs and other methods and teach you how to react when things come up. Sometimes therapeutic methods don‚Äôt work for people. People like me have a tough time venting to others. I learned that sometimes I come out of the therapist anger and mad. Sometimes I leave happy and relieved feeling better. Work on recording your feelings on paper. Bring them in so it‚Äôs easier to express how you feel about everything. Hope everything gets better...because it will!!!
AnxietyDepression,f4nydnv,t3_dl2hgb,1571694338.0,Same here man my parents don‚Äôt understand and have threatened to kick me out of the house multiple times because I start fights and get very irritated and angry quick. It just seems like they say all the wrong things. Sometimes it can fuck with your head too and make problems worse. Best thing to do is tell you doctor and schedule a meeting with all four of you guys. My parents are so strict that they still don‚Äôt understand so I didn‚Äôt the worst thing possible and turned to drugs because it seemed like no one in my family understood. It‚Äôs hard to through you parents sometimes. They love you and care for you so much. When times get tough with them remember this. Hope this is some good advice! It will get better with time!!!
AnxietyDepression,f4b1vg6,t3_dk3j3e,1571505317.0,Usually these are the side affects of the Prozac and they will last for about a week and slowly go away. Just continue to remind your self that they are side effects. They suck and I hate the feeling because I tend to jump on people when I feel that way. Hope you start to feel better!!!

AnxietyDepression,f3zxfui,t3_dimza3,1571279282.0,"The medical cannabis does wonders for my anxiety and depression, but I run into problems with using it because of my parents not accepting it and thinking I‚Äôm abusing it. Doctors also think cannabis is addictive and a terrible drug and they also talk badly about it. It‚Äôs a shame because they probably have never tried it before. Does anyone have any suggestions about how I tell my doctors and parents how it makes me feel... I hate the stigma that goes with it."

depression,f0qux0r,t1_f0qthgw,1568867029.0,"I lie 	to my parents, doctors and a lot of people all the time. It‚Äôs a habit forming type of thing because you have to protect yourself it‚Äôs almost like a shell you put on to cover up from all your problems. Nothings better than to be TRUTHFUL with yourself and others and dude trust me once you start doing that a little bit off that weight falls off your shoulders. You‚Äôre not a shitty human by anything. I procrastinate till this day on everything I do it‚Äôs something that comes with being human. We wanna do things we like instead of that hard work.

I had anxiety depression throughout high school and had no idea. I coped by binge drinking and smoking a ton of weed which probably fucked me up even more. Anyways, it‚Äôs really hard for someone to express how they feel to others especially in our generation because of social media, technology etc. I left college because of my issues and got help and I‚Äôm still figuring out some problems that I have but, You gotta trust me and get help it‚Äôs the best thing you can do rn. It‚Äôs gonna be hard... really really hard but, their are brighter days ahead. Life‚Äôs hard though but, remember this, you have a purpose and will do something great one day, you were put on earth for a reason.

All I remember was him telling me that ‚Äúgold is very precious and that guy we traded with is very dumb‚Äù I have never used an opioid in my entire life.

At times my head feels like a nuclear bomb ready to explode. I used to smoke weed to cope with problems for years and tried medicinal marijuana and it worked like a charm but, I have anti weed parents who punished me for it and called me an addict. So here I am struggling to get good grades and hanging in their. I just sick and tired of all of this bullshit and sick and tired of not being able to feel happiness. It‚Äôs so draining. Sometimes I just wonder why tf does this happen and why would the creator or earth fuck with our heads like this."
