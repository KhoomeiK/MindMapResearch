With hard work, therapy, and meds (and/or alternative treatments), I don't think this will always be the case. 20 years of dealing with this for me -- I've had long stretches without hospitalizations, and short stretches with multiple hospitalizations. It's frustrating and difficult, but it's possible to persevere.

> Do you think this means I need a med change? I thought I was stable. I was doing so well for so many months.

Totally a possibility, but only you and your p-doc can determine that. Could even just be a med adjustment (higher dose, etc) and not a total change. There might be other factors involved that you might not even be considering that a professional with an outside perspective might be able to recognize. Talk with your doc and support team -- all they're going to want to do is help.

I'm so sorry you're going through this and I truly hope things get better soon."
