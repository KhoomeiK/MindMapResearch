Another one aswell but it was the same year swarm so I didn't expect much of it. Currently hoping that another swarm from last year survives this winter. Until you have a lot of beehives sometimes you just take huge losses. What I'd recommend is if you ever get more hives, try different treatments for mites. Sometimes the treatment works or sometimes it doesn't. By varying the treatments you can mitigate the losses."
