If they say back to ya like being mean and all defensive etc.. I dunno if they are good friends if they wont listen to ya.

I get that stuff somehow.. Like when im scared of stuff like.. Not being in love with bf like sometimes i dont have fun with him and bored but thats normal, not everyday with bf is like dancing on lovey dovey clouds (← i still have to learn this) but yeah.. When i feel like im bored with my bf i start to panic kind of.. I think:

""What about i use him and i dont really love him???""
""Am i really in love with him?!"" 
Etc.. It can be really stressing sometimes its just that i dont wanna hurt him so when i start to panic kind of i start google stuff or watch videos to find out whats wrong even if nothing is wrong.. I dont know if this is same stuff probably not i dunno but i still wanted to tell.. 

And im pretty perfectionist about everything. I dont mean that perfectionism is ocd, no its not. I just mean that i watch myself really closely cause i dont wanna hurt anyone in any way or be just mean.."
OCD,fhuh9xf,t1_fhth41f,1581886400.0,"Thank you a lot! I think these will help, ill try these out and see.

Part where you told me about where you think that what if you didnt start obsessing.. I shed a few tears cause i felt that.. Like it sucks when your brain does stuff like this and sometimes its out of your control and you blame yourself. It sucks, i do this a lot but i try my best to not always blame myseöf cause of these thoughts. 

I liked or loved to read how about your techinuque. Ill maybe try those. I want to especially try that one where i am at sone event like with friend or public place, sometimes i start to have worries etc. so i could try to go to somewhere where i am alone like bathroom and take a deep breath, maybe try to calm my mind down if its racing up.. I maybe have something that smells good and i sniff it (it helps a bit), then ig breath and focus on it.. If that doesnt help i can call to my friend.. I dunno. Im trying to think stuff that are best for me and maybe help ya out too?

But uh.. Again, thank you a lot. I was really happy to read this like know that im not alone and stuff.. I hope ya good luck too!"
