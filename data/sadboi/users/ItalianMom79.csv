SuicideWatch,erp35az,t3_c34ko8,1561097676.0,I feel the same way about losing ny current bf I am suicidal the thought of not being with him kills me but being with him kills me. Its not your fault she was broken hearted deeper then you. She was happy with you but it was temporary she regretted all her past mistakes some people me included believe we should be perfect. And if we fail at things we always wanted its hard to pull yourself out if it. I think if she could agree she would and She would be happy for the love and time you gave her. She couldnt love herself so she didnt know how someone else could. Just my thoughts and I think she would want you to know she loved you and wants you to be happy and love yourself... Im sure she will be waiting for you if there is a after life. I should clarify I feel how she did.

BPDlovedones,eqr6egr,t3_bzan8q,1560250437.0,Working on herself how? If its ti better herself she would not be in a relationship with that person unless he helps her emotionally and cant be alone which I understand a little maybe shes scared she will hurt you and she is trying to work on herself but dont want to be alone and that guy can handle her problems shes dealing with without her feeling like shes hurting you or causing you problems in your life. But its just my thoughts from someone that loves someone but Needs to fix themselves and its hard when there are people that your afraid of hurting in your life in a way like if you were her boyfriend maybe she thinks she would mess it up right now and wants to be better first. Or maybe shes afraid you may be really hurt of you never talk to her again or maybe it would really hurt her because she loves you but cant be the person she thinks you deserve.
BPDlovedones,eqr5mdh,t3_bzan8q,1560249392.0,You should talk to her about this maybe she doesnt even realize or believe how much you love her. Maybe you both need to talk to someone if she is willing to and if not you should try and heal your heart and move on.
BPDlovedones,eqr556m,t3_bz0f56,1560248713.0,maybe she hates how much she loves you because it scares her. Maybe it is trauma associated I told someone I hated him but I dont I hate the amount of control Im willing to give him just for approval and for him to love me the way I do him.
BPDlovedones,eqqyots,t3_bz64jr,1560238518.0,Thats kinda rude he is somebody and he is something he deserves love as well he just needs help if you really loved him you would try and get that help with him. Just because you feel like he r abused you doenst mean hes nothing and doesnt mean he dont deserve understanding and help and love. Obviously hes been through something to make him this way and Im not saying this to justify what he did or say its your fault Im saying it because there are people that dont know what effect they have on people until the damage is done. And if someone that is this type of person reads this they may feel attacked and like they dont deserve anything. Noone deserves to be abused or treated like noone loves them or could accept them because of the trauma or abuse ir mental problems they have. Everyone deserves to feel love from someone and feel important if they dont it cant end badly.
BPDlovedones,eqqxqnz,t3_bz5ac7,1560237175.0,I understand that feeling but have you told her how bad you want her and then when your around her or you think she is going to want sex you reject her?And when its a perfect chance not some fucked up situation that makes her feel used or disrespected Im just asking from personal things ive been through that sound similar. I had my boyfriend tell me how much he wanted me and what he wanted to do to me and then when we were together he would start a fight or never do the things he said. Me personally if i told him I would do them I wanted to at least try it and if he didnt feel comfortable he could stop it. But there were times he  would say no to things but his dick said different. So i wanted to give him it.
dating_advice,eqqusl4,t3_byydws,1560233457.0,Dont stop maybe one day the girl will match your feelings and emotions just continue to be you be honest with who you are and dont let other woman effect your judgement on the next that will fuck up something that may really be a good thing. If it doesnt work out ask them why and if  its something you honestly feel would be a positive change for you and help you with your next relationship and its not going to make you unhappy or make you untrue with yourself then change. Maybe you pushed her away or she pushed you away because you were so good to her and she didnt know what she was worth. That happens to alot of men and woman do to past relationships and things they have heard or seen.
dating_advice,eqltpl9,t3_bylcft,1560149879.0,Maybe they are at work or dont always look at their messages.
