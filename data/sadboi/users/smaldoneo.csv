And yes, snow tires are essential for the kind of weather we get. Also be prepared for road salt everywhere in the winter. Salt, salt, EVERYWHERE. Makes things look gross and muddy, but it's whatever. You'll probably need to take extra care of your shoes because of this if you want them to stay nice.

Anyway, winter in Corning can bring out it's best :)"
