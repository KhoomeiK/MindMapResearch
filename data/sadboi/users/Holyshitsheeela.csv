Like you want to drag around their ghost, and you want to keep whatever memories you have of them close to you. But I have a hard time letting go.

I was honestly wondering if they were going to try to set Bill up to retire because of it. Like they mentioned Bill‚Äôs case files were accessible to Brian and that could have influenced or desensitized him. 

But they set Brain up for a character arc for sure I'm just not convinced that added to the overall plot that much. I think showing Bill having issues balancing work and home was important, but having his son participate in a murder was an extreme take on it."

MindHunter,fagu0ek,t1_faedawu,1576071240.0,Yeah that would totally ruin the series for me. I definitely want to see them continue the timeline they have set up. I think they have the main characters set up for a lot of personal growth and I want to see how they develop particularly with Wendy in a professional aspect and Holden on a personal aspect.
MindHunter,faed4uo,t1_faeanel,1575998635.0,I just think if you jump like two decades into the future you‚Äôre gonna lose all of that opportunity for developments and are we really following just the plot line of the BTK killer? Because I think that there were a lot of pretty notorious serial killers in that time and I can‚Äôt understand why they would focus on the serial killer that they couldn‚Äôt capture with profilings instead of all the ones they did. I also really wanna see more of Holden and Ed Kemper together I think it‚Äôs so fascinating the actor that they got to played Ed is so convincing.
MindHunter,faecm9k,t1_faeanel,1575998367.0,"What arc? Do you mean that Bill and Wendy have had their personal lives explored more? Because I agree with that. I‚Äôd like to see more of Holden‚Äôs personal life. I‚Äôm actually not super crazy about what they did with Bill. I think the whole story line with his kid and the dead body seems improbable. Idk. I mean it was surprising and maybe it was there for the shock factor but it just didn‚Äôt seem as realistic as other parts of the show and there‚Äôs so much that‚Äôs shocking and kind of grease him on the show anyway. I also feel like standing holding to Atlanta it was kind of out there. I mean maybe that was meant to show him as a compassionate character or maybe they were just trying to weave in the murders in Atlanta but it just seemed a little disjointed that he would just give up on the interviews and start working with the Atlanta PD. I did really love to see Wendy conducting interviews this last season and I really love the way that she did it because if you think about the time. Being openly gay was just not something you could do and I think her kind of admitting that was such a coy tactic. Not to say that Holden doesn‚Äôt have good tactics when he‚Äôs doing the interviews but hers just kind of hit a different level for me I thought the interaction was really interesting. I never read the book so I don‚Äôt know if this is an accurate thing but I really liked the way it played out dramatically.

I‚Äôm probably just over analyzing the show at this point."
