emergencymedicine,fqxxmhy,t1_fqxijoc,1589739404.0,His urine was concentrated. Plus the casts were seen and his kidney function looked like crap so I was thinking dehydration.
emergencymedicine,fqxxifs,t1_fqwesjb,1589739355.0,He wasnt down very long at all in either fall. I think it may just have been chronic due to decreased thirst in general.
emergencymedicine,fqxx92f,t1_fqwq0xd,1589739243.0,Sodium can't kill her if she dies of shock first.
emergencymedicine,fqwfsfu,t1_fqweyrw,1589702856.0,"I can very well be wrong but this is how I understand it.

In isolated euvolemic hypernatremia I can see D5W is the best because it's the most free water.

1/2NS is less free water, therefore you'd need to give more overall to get the same amount of free water. So I think this may be better for hypotensive patients. And while it has sodium in it the concentration is much lower compared to serum so you're still diluting the serum, just more slowly and less efficiently. However if they need volume then you get more out of this method."
emergencymedicine,fqwevww,t1_fqwefxs,1589701947.0,That makes sense. Thank you.
emergencymedicine,fqweujr,t1_fqwdt4h,1589701910.0,"I wonder if he was concerned about his dehydration, but he wasnt exactly in shock or hypotensive so I don't see why he wouldnt have picked 1/2NS."
emergencymedicine,fqwepgs,t1_fqwdglg,1589701770.0,"I'd say euvolemic, then you can probably go with D5W. This guy was at 161, but was probably at that for awhile and was walky talky, though also dehydrated. I think 1/2NS would be better in his case."
emergencymedicine,fqwdvqn,t1_fqwd4g1,1589700952.0,"See Carly\_Rae\_Jetson's response below. I may be wrong in this but I think of fluid in the body in general as water, and lytes. Hypernatremia is often too little water, and hyponatremia is vice versa. (There are a lot of other situations but keeping it simple and related to this case.) Hypovolemia I see both equally depleted. So if there is a hypovolemia component I think a more balanced approach works better. That's what I understand of it, but I'd see what more knowledgable people say. The complexities of hypo/hypernatremia stuff was one of the harder things for me to get as far as the pathophys."
emergencymedicine,fqwbgzs,t1_fqw9ypu,1589698613.0,"From what I read and took from others here either can work. D5W is pretty much free water. 1/2 NS is less free water but allows you to replace some electrolytes. Someone who is euvolemic can probably do straight D5W. Someone who is hypovolemic I think 1/2 NS may be better to get some lytes in too. I think the key is to go slow, recheck chem and tailor replenishment as you go."
emergencymedicine,fqw8x89,t1_fqw83xt,1589696287.0,"I believe Illustrious was pointing out that 1/2NS is the way to go, which is what the hospitalist wanted and what's in the literature."
emergencymedicine,fqw8q9h,t1_fqw7kk5,1589696116.0,"I get that, but if you're adding it to NS, you're not adding any more free water to the NS, just the dextrose right? If you added any free water it wouldnt be NS."
emergencymedicine,fqw7z0l,t1_fqw4wxh,1589695472.0,"Knowing what D5+NS actually is now, it makes the decision and reasoning much easier. Still in my first year and still learning but don't know why I've always assumed it was a dilution. Thanks for the info and article."
emergencymedicine,fqw7cp7,t1_fqw649y,1589694951.0,"Yeah, I believed the etiology was water wasting and while he wasn't overtly hypotensive or anything I do believe he was dry and his kidneys were also paying for it.  I completely messed up thinking NS +D5W meant a dilution of the NS, I didnt realize it was just NS with 5% dextrose. Knowing that I'd probably have opted for the 1/2 NS. I don't know why my attending preferred the  NS+D5. He did say he wanted to correctly slowly but that rate seems like a crawl at best. 

That now makes me wonder why if any point the D5 has with NS, or even half normal saline."

physicianassistant,fqqhf92,t1_fqpqrvo,1589565566.0,"Which also bothers me, because some admission criteria to PA schools are very close to medical schools and it bothers me. I applied to schools who focused more on HCE. In either case though the clinical hours for PA that are needed are a lot higher."
physicianassistant,fqouhb0,t3_gjzqav,1589525230.0,"Another major issue is these fast track to NP programs. Meaning people go from little to no experience in the medical field to NP off the bat. NP originally was for nurses with experience. I think the NP curriculum may work for those veteran ICU or ER nurses, but not so much for very green nurses or pre-RN people."

emergencymedicine,fn4119k,t1_fn3z4ki,1586631878.0,"It's not a failure of the system. It's just not how the system works, and I'm speaking of the ER. However, mental health support in this country, especially more rural areas is extremely lacking which is why a lot of these non urgent cases come to the ER, because the usual resources don't exist or are full up and have long waiting times.

So I agree with you that system is broken, that still doesn't make it appropriate for the ER. Aside from not being designed for it, issues like this and other mental health stuff requires close follow up with a single provider who is familiar with you. That is completely opposite of what the ER is."

While she was here we went to my therapist together (I got one to try to work on my issues some of which were affecting the relationship). She stayed the week, things seemed fine and she went back to her place telling me she'll do every other week then went radio silent. 

Asked her what was up and she finally told me after the therapy session she doesnt think she can be with me and that I should find someone who can better deal with my issues. I went to therapy to try to save the relationship. Kinda feel abandoned by my best friend at the worst time. I guess this doesnt really count since she's not living here.
