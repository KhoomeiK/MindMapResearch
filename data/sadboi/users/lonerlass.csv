I think about running away regularly. 

One of my strongest memories of being a child was when I used to try and run away from home. 

Hopefully I will have my own place again soon, and life is a bit more secure / familiar again now back at my hometown, so I’m hoping I can settle for about a year and get my shit together. The reason I want to do that is with the aim of then fleeing properly afterwards and never returning."

good point about the emotions coming seemingly out of nowhere and then it seems unhelpful. I guess that the key is to noticing emotions and becoming more attuned with oneself all round. 
I complained to a senior doctor last Friday about being completely overlooked and not taken seriously, then, yesterday I had my scm appointment, and long story short I went with the intention to throw the towel in, but after it came to light that my care workers obviously had some stick for negligence, I no longer have to do decider skills to get cbt, I’m being offered much more support to help me leave the house and look at rebuilding my life, essentially. They’re pushing for family therapy again too after briefly mentioning barriers to getting well. Super grateful the doctor listened to me and took action, I’ve been in a significantly better mood since and more hopeful and motivated. I should have had sufficient support from the start, but at least he genuinely listened to me and didn’t write me off. The battle continues, for now at least..."

Avoid having a bf or gf because 1. You’re scared you’ll ‘pick a bad one’ again and end up back in a cycle of some form of abuse, or, 2. You’re pretty ashamed of yourself and the pathetic excuse of a ‘life’ you’ve been scraping together, and feel like no one could like you because you’re unemployed, mentally ill, struggle to be around people, and have no certainty about anything, including what you want for the future.

Or

Just really struggle to know what they want for their future. (If you want kids or not, to get married or not, where you want to live, what career path you want to pursue after experiencing a range previously, for eg. and in my case). Like I feel so uncertain about everything. Not even leaning slightly towards one or the other."

Is emotional first aid like emotional regulation techniques? Is that a group or individual? Just curious as ours say we have to do something like I described but it’s called ‘decider skills’ and mandatory to get cbt or have trauma therapy... total bs and infuriating.

AskWomen,fhahoah,t3_f1yxv3,1581411055.0,"Yes, and it grows and grows. It’s tiring having your guard up all of the time because 9x out of 10 if a man’s showing interest it’s because he wants to get into your pants. They like to make out women are overdramatic or childish/inferior. I avoid most men, i always ask to see female workers in healthcare, I left a male dominated workforce and I rarely go out drinking anymore because I’m sick to death of being harassed. They always spoil my night. My advice : learn to be straight talking to men and don’t feel like you have to come across as nice or friendly out of politeness because you’re just making problems for yourself. You don’t have to be rude, just display to them that you’re strong headed. Men don’t like powerful, self confident women."
