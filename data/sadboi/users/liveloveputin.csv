psychadelic,fpjwezo,t3_gdsz5n,1588682754.0,"I have BPD and I‚Äôm very far along in recovery and I study psychology at Uni (just so you know I‚Äôm giving you a stable and informed opinion). And just in case you‚Äôre not spiritual I will tell you factually that people come and go in your lives and the fact that I‚Äôve discovered this is a part of that connection!

Psychedelics, specifically LSD, have been very important in my recovery. My trips have contributed as much to my mental health as psychiatry and psychology (including DBT) have. I wouldn‚Äôt be me without them. It‚Äôs hard to compare treatments because they all have a different role to play. 
Psychology has helped me build a better life for myself, psychiatry has helped manage some symptoms, and Psychedelics have given me the deepest insight into who I am, then restructured my reality for the better.

It‚Äôs been really intense every time, a lot of the time scary. Because trips manifest from our deepest internal experiences, and there is A LOT of repressed trauma that comes with BPD, you can expect some extremely dark experiences. But, have you ever had a rock bottom before? And once you push through it and come out the other side you learn more about life than you could hope for? It‚Äôs all worth it, and it‚Äôs very similar.

One of the fundamental features of a mystic experience as laid out by Marsha M. Linehan in the DBT manual is that it can‚Äôt be explained in words, only by story or metaphor.
During my most profound experience, I was meditating. I had 620ug and 2 caps, more than I had ever done before. When I started peaking, I freaked the fuck out. I went and sat in a bed and tried to meditate. For a while, it was as if I could experiences every person in the world‚Äôs emotions all at once. I suddenly had the most profound transpersonal connection I have ever experienced. It was terrifying. Straight after I began successfully meditating. As I breathed in, the world around I saw the world in its entirety. As I breathed out, the universe disappeared into clear headed whiteness and nothingness. They call this Kensh≈ç in Zen Buddhism. A brief glimpse of enlightenment and nirvana - inner peace.

In the new Netflix series, Duncan Trussell gives an amazing metaphor for psychedelics. Something like: ‚Äòit‚Äôs as if you go on an elevator in your apartment complex. But this time you go right up to a top floor you‚Äôve never been on before. When you get there and the doors open, you see the most amazing party in the entire world, where everyone is having the best time of their life. Then the doors close and you leave‚Äù. Not word for word.

It‚Äôs not always this huge experience tho. Sometimes I just drop a little bit and go out with mates, feel super chatty. Sometimes I have a medium amount and I just feel really happy, usually very mindful and experience the world only in the present moment. Music is AMAZING! Way better than on weed. And every time I have a good experience it‚Äôs completely due to the huge amounts of just profound and unexplainable love that I have for every human being and every other piece of existence. Just so much love. That‚Äôs the best part of LSD.

Specifically with BPD, and to elaborate on the restructuring of my inner self:
There‚Äôs this experience called Ego death or Psychic death that can come with a decent dose of psychedelics. Some people even experience it on micro doses. Essentially it‚Äôs like you go into this trip as yourself, then you start just completely tripping balls and leave reality as you know it (I think it was Timothy Leary or Terrence McKenna who describes it as the ‚Äòascent into psychosis‚Äô, but don‚Äôt let that deter you, ‚Äòascent‚Äô is the key word). You‚Äôll begin to experience all kinds of weird shit like what I described earlier. 
I can‚Äôt find it but there‚Äôs a fair bit of information about common transcendence experiences, like meeting higher powers, seeing the beginning and/or the end of the universe, becoming a higher power, knowing the truth of the creation of the universe. Sounds crazy I know! I‚Äôm not psychotic! You have to experience it to understand just how real these things are. Anyway, these experiences always teach you something. They‚Äôre usually really difficult. This is actually what people refer to as a bad trip. In psychonaut communities it‚Äôs called a ‚Äòpsychedelic crisis‚Äô. Crisis can sound misleading. So you learn about the world and while that‚Äôs happening you as a being disappear. Once the experience is over your new self is born and everything you learn becomes integrated into your existence, you become a new person within.

This is always really beneficial for my BPD. Parts of my disorder are completely resolved. I went into one trip completely addicted to weed (you can be addicted to weed it‚Äôs psychological fact) and came out without a single craving. They say it resets the dopamine system, responsible for addiction.

I know this post rambled a bit but just know that it will help. Some experiences are happy and full of love, others are terrifying and full of insight. The good trips give you great happiness for hours, of which pwBPD have a huge shortage of in their history. The bad trips change your life. Always worth it!

Message me if you wanna chat about this I‚Äôd be really excited to do that!

If you‚Äôre not committed, drop romantic and sexual relationships for a while. You will struggle and begin to learn a lot about yourself, stuff that‚Äôs impossible to learn while you‚Äôre spending all your time struggling with relationships.

A few tricks regarding vocabulary:
  Replace ‚Äòbut‚Äô with ‚Äòand‚Äô. Through this you‚Äôll learn dialectics. That two opposing thoughts can both be valid.
  Change ‚ÄúI am sad‚Äù to ‚ÄúI am experiencing sadness‚Äù, and the same with other emotions. It seems small and when you‚Äôre feeling your worst sometimes it is the most helpful thing you can imagine. Just to know that this is something you are going through, not who you are.

Things I find helpful:
  Dropping the rope - when you are struggling with an argument, internally or externally, it can be like a game of tug-o-war. You can struggle and maybe win, at the end you will always end up tired and defeated. Sometimes it is best to just drop the rope and let it go. Your thoughts or the person can pull all they want, they can no longer hurt you.
  Find things that make you happy - at times when you feel alone and defeated, it helps to be able to turn to activities that bring you a sense of happiness or calmness.
  Just the facts (non judgmental) - when your mind starts racing, just turn things back to the bare facts. When someone leaves me on Read, I remind myself ‚ÄúI sent a message, they read it, they didn‚Äôt reply, I feel sad.‚Äù Anything else is my mind taking the wheel without permission.

You‚Äôre right. Stigma is a bitch. Find people who listen and who you do not feel like a bad person around."
BPD,f9pvkrl,t3_e68z6s,1575549823.0,"Consider an argument a game of tug-o-war.
You can pull and pull all you like. You might even win. At the end you‚Äôre both going to end up exhausted and defeated.
Sometimes, when the game can‚Äôt be civil, it‚Äôs best to just drop the rope. Let the other person pull all they want, you don‚Äôt need to struggle, you‚Äôve let go.

Dropping the rope is helpful in arguments you have mindfully realised are going nowhere or are unimportant/a waste of your time.

Dropping the rope is a form of acceptance. It can also be helpful when you‚Äôre caught up in an internal struggle, not just external ones."
