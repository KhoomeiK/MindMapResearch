mbti,fmv887v,t3_fxg9ft,1586408743.0,"Based on this “most accurate description,” I am definitely an INFJ. I’ve pretty consistently been typed as one and I would say 90% of the above statements were hallelujahs. The only that didn’t click was the detach me once, detach me twice one. I generally try to either be honest or just don’t say anything when it comes to justifying my decisions about people to their faces, even if it’s something negative like why I cut them off.

I must say the defensive tone of this post made me laugh a bit though. Seemed a bit undue. But the content was good and I always appreciate rigor in analysis. I think I’ve been convinced. Although the ending was a bit of a knife twist—we’re destined to be unhappy? Dannng it OP"

infj,flmkwr2,t1_flck0d4,1585286758.0,"Wait I’m shook—yes. INFJ 4w3 here. Didn’t think I related to this post at first because I am very measured/calm and I do not have rage issues in the least...but something struck a cord about the “seething rage.”

I feel it specifically when I see the helpless or the vulnerable being preyed on. Girls/women and old people particularly. I saw a headline about the New Delhi bus rapists who were executed by the state recently, was reminded of the gory details of the crime again, and vehemently experienced bloodlust and satisfaction over the death penalty. Times like that, “seething rage” is absolutely fitting. 

I have also over time channeled this general rage towards predatory men and rapists into boxing, which has become one of my favorite hobbies and preferred way to workout. I often find myself saying things like “I’d like to see them try” or “I would love to fight them.” I’m actually more of a “flight” instinct when it comes down to it, but it’s only when I’ve had time to think on the injustice/evil of it all that I get really mad. Never thought it was connected to INFJ tendencies!"

infj,flmjh96,t3_fpkgnj,1585285481.0,"Yes!! I absolutely love it. I’m a writer and very much an observer. That’s why even though I am very much a homebody introvert, this coronavirus is making me sad...because I can’t be out and about just observing city life, people watching, etc. 

Sometimes I don’t even feel like people are necessarily the focus of the activity. It’s more about a scene, a tapestry of moving parts, a microcosm, a vibe...being able to be a part of it but also be observing from the outside.

EDIT: I just realized something even creepier. I like to HOME WATCH. There is no way this doesn’t make me sound like a burglar or a stalker but I love looking at big apartment buildings at night from afar with all their little windows glowing with warm light—thinking about how many people’s lives are contained in that building and what each of them are doing at that time. When I’m walking down the street, I like to peek through the street-facing windows if they’re open and see what’s going on—observe the pets staring out, the different choices of houseplants on the sill, anything at all. I chalk this up to my intense passion for home decor/homebodyness + the innate desire to observe and understand."

thebachelor,fl34cav,t1_fl2j1rk,1584768385.0,"It’s great that we are able to separate Asian Americans and the CCP. I would go a step further and say it’s not even an issue of particularly egregious Chinese governmental negligence. They made mistakes but every government is slow to respond. One could argue the US government also massively underestimated and downplayed the outbreak too in the past few weeks—certainly the President’s communication, documented very clearly on Twitter, reflects that. 

My bigger point is that, if we’re going to address global politics at this point in the crisis, I think we need to be more surgical with our rejection of China’s authoritarian government, which I am completely on board with, and our analysis of its reaction to COVID-19. The WHO has repeatedly praised China for its swift response. They isolated the virus, sequenced it, shared it with the global health community, built two hospitals in under a month, and flattened the curve dramatically which, yes, helps us all. In the coming months, we would hope to be a China in terms of how they’ve dealt with the virus, and not an Italy or Iran.

Pandemics are by nature a collectivist, “tragedy of the commons” issue. Thus the most utilitarian net positive outcome lends itself to governments that can act quickly and erect barriers to human movement, and a population that will comply. This isn’t politics or saying China is better or justified for it. It’s simply fact and structure. That is where I think we get tripped up, because we don’t feel good about China’s underlying political structure and its trade offs, and that can bleed into our objectivity when we address issues that desperately need good science and objectivity, like this pandemic."

I’m only about a month in (brief disruption due to getting sick) but it’s even more important to me now that I’m quarantining. The kitchen is there all the time and old me would’ve been out of my mind and jumping out of my skin without this to give me peace and calm. That’s what it is—not starvation. And in these times, it can be a matter of health and grave illness too, as my food stores will last so much longer without a binge. Thankful."

I’m doing really well with controlling my binging right now too because of this kick in the ass of, “Fuck, I have a real potentially huge problem now if I don’t recover.” If I binge all my food within the week, that creates a health risk for me. I don’t purge so I’m lucky to only be dealing with half the problem, perhaps a milder form of ED. But gosh, stay safe and if you don’t hear it from anyone else, I’m really proud of you for doing the right thing to keep yourself healthy and safe and for thinking of the community like this."

EatingDisorders,fkjn5i8,t3_fifqok,1584251420.0,"Hey all, OP here. Thank you for your insights. You guys echoed some beginnings of best practices I’ve been thinking on, like buying dry staples and foods that need to be prepared. I’ve also been inspired to think more categorically about my trigger foods (any dessert, peanut butter, chocolate, baked goods, cheese, meat, etc). It’s tempting to grab some snacks re: emotional eating, stress eating, and “morale food” in prepper terms (r/preppers wya), but I have to remember it’s just my brain trying to trick me into thinking this is good for me...again. In a strange way, do you guys ever think that binging behavior at one point was probably evolutionarily beneficial to our ancestors? And that coronavirus is the closest thing to replicating those past conditions of herd panic and scarcity that might be triggering the behavior yet again? Damn parabolic, indeed.

I will admit I went a bit crazy today and bought $150 worth of groceries—but I feel it’s necessary to elaborate on the situation. I live in NYC and have been instructed to work from home for the next two weeks. I actually caught what I think is a cold last week, so I am extra paranoid about getting coronavirus now while my immune system is still struggling to recover. I’m otherwise a healthy 22 year old with no underlying issues, but frankly, we still know so little about the disease and I’d rather not risk it. Hence why I did cave and panic-buy. I did a mix of non-perishables (useful but not healthy) and fresh fruit and veg (mostly freezer friendly). I’m literally trying not to go out for the next two weeks so I bought a pack of digestives, some baking chocolate chips, and chocolate milk for the sweet tooth, fearing if that I cut myself off completely I’d break and go back outside for dessert. I’m going to lock the first two in my self locking container so I can’t get to them outside of my daily portion. The chocolate milk we’ll just have to pray I can control myself around lol."
EatingDisorders,fkjml70,t1_fkiayhr,1584250833.0,"This is very true. If we really starve, we’ll have other problems to worry about, like the collapse of transportation, our government, and plumbing/heating lol. I’m more so just worried about price gouging with food, especially in the dense urban location I live in, and taking a hit financially because I couldn’t control my eating. 

The question then becomes, diet or money! It’s so easy to buy into the panic and the logic of “what’s the harm in being prepared?” But I keep on having to remember that for people like us, there IS a very real harm to having too much food around. :/"
EatingDisorders,fkjmeaa,t1_fkhic10,1584250639.0,Glad to know I’m not alone. My binging actually got so bad that I went to a therapist to address it for the first time in my 22 years of life just a few weeks ago. I actually really started to turn things around through starting intermittent fasting. Had just completed three weeks of IF and was due for my second therapy session when coronavirus hit the US full in the face. Thanks for nothing coronavirus.
EatingDisorders,fkjm6zf,t1_fkh6ldk,1584250432.0,"Love this insight (I’m OP). Yeah, I’ve noticed before that buying non-instant or non-snackable foods does help. However, my concern is sometimes if I don’t buy any snacks at all, I end up making stuff—like mug cakes, crepes, pancakes, very carb heavy items—and binging all of that, which can be just as calorific. My solve for THAT was to just not buy flour and make baked goods anymore, but in a time of stockpiling it naturally is a key staple and also sometimes I want to make things like zucchini fritters and I need to buy flour...

It just gets so frustrating and humiliating sometimes. I feel like I’m trying to trick some kind of monkey (my binging brain) into a cage (not binging) and I’m pretzeling myself over something that “normal” people don’t even blink twice about.

So it’ll be like 8 am to 4 pm, which is really nice because I basically know that when I get home from work the kitchen is simply a place to prepare tomorrow’s lunch and drink water—no more agonizing over when or what to eat/snack on. 

It does get kind of tortuous to smell all the delicious home cooking my roommate does around dinner (right now my nostrils are grazing on a huge T-bone steak sizzling in butter and scallion pancakes from scratch being fried) but that’s how amazing IF has been for my appetite—all my senses are working, my stomach is even growling reflexively, and yet...I don’t feel...the hunger??"

Though I’m a 4, I reject the notion that we’re doomed to feel forever “misunderstood” because we feel we’re so different. The world is pretty big and we’re always less alone than we think we are. That’s my two cents anyway!"
lonely,f72akkj,t3_dtmhis,1573357148.0,"Girl, I feel you. Graduated from college this year in May and let me tell you, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. I have a full time job I really like now and it’s just so much better than the isolation and crippling loneliness I felt in college. Not much has changed in terms of my friendships or relationships but I think sometimes college is just a toxic environment for some of us. Me being an introvert who wasn’t into drinking or drugs, it was hard. People in college are also just selfish and shallow as hell. Glad to be out and I think you will too. :)"

Don’t worry, it’s out there for you too."
muji,f6kw3qs,t1_f6idspv,1572922176.0,Update: It’s fixed! I guess drying it worked. Thanks all!

plantclinic,f5qtngc,t1_f5pckhp,1572382804.0,So what I’m getting is that I ought to get a pot that’s 14 inch on top and 12 on the bottom (assuming I can’t find a straight cylinder)?
plantclinic,f5p03rf,t1_f5k0lzy,1572342230.0,Thank you!! I had a pot question on my reply to another comment basically along the lines of: is a nursery pot that is 12 on top and 9.5 on bottom diameter sufficient?
plantclinic,f5ozz3q,t1_f5kgm6n,1572342025.0,"Thank you so much for the input! I’m so glad I found this forum. I am taking your advice.

This is going to be the stupidest question, but the last one, I swear. I have begun looking into 12 in nursery pots for my baby and I’m coming across a LOT of pots that are wider on the top than on the bottom by a few inches. My current pot is 10 inches diameter top AND bottom (aka a straight cylinder) but all these new pots are like 12 inches by 9.5 inches. Isn’t that defeating the purpose if I actually decrease circumference at the bottom of the pot, where roots need most space to grow? But then will I overwhelm the plant if I get a 14 in pot so that it has 12 in of room at the bottom? Where do I find a normal pot?!"
plantclinic,f5jl6om,t1_f5jfzsf,1572231697.0,"Dang it. The struggle continues! While I hunt for a larger nursery pot and decorative pot, do you recommend I water it frequently each time soil is dry?"
plantclinic,f5jfw9k,t1_f5jflqp,1572227404.0,"Ok thanks! I watered it two days ago and tested it yesterday, and the meter said DRY again. Should I go ahead and rewater after just two days, or wait a few more?"
plantclinic,f5jdbuy,t1_f5igmtw,1572225362.0,"Ok, thanks! Yeah, I’m just petrified of overwatering because it seems a harder problem to fix and more of a common mistake. But I guess I’ve been really underwatering the poor guy, even as the weather gets colder?"
plantclinic,f5jd8ih,t1_f5hm14h,1572225287.0,"Thanks! Yeah, it was the roots when I took it out of the pot. Ugh, why do big retailers sell plants to you exactly when they need to be repotted? Do you recommend a specific soil mix for repotting?"
plantclinic,f5jczh3,t1_f5icqge,1572225074.0,Thanks! I heard they like to be quite pot bound and to switch the pot when the roots start growing out of it. There’s a couple roots coiled at the top of the plant but I’m not sure if that’s considered growing out. Are there any risks to repotting if it’s not in fact ready?
plantclinic,f5jcvck,t1_f5go4sp,1572224980.0,"I actually got a moisture meter as part of my attempt to diagnose! Was the driest at 1 and I watered it, but next day I tested soil again and it was dry at 1 again!? Am I watering wrong or not enough?"
infj,evxgn8p,t3_cljxsd,1564891831.0,"Me definitely. I don’t get panic attacks or anything, but just regular hopelessness and despair, almost daily tbh. I’ve slowly come to realize that it tends to happen when I let myself have too much time to think (at night when I can’t fall asleep, in long car rides, when I’m bored and lonely) so I think the best solution for me has been to just fucking do something. I have a lot of hobbies actually but it’s just hard to keep them top of mind or overcome my natural malaise/laziness to do nothing. 

It’s a balance between productive healthy diversion (hobbies, improving skills, building yourself up as a human) and radical acceptance (agree with what a lot of others are saying about looking into Buddhism and spirituality stuff).

Lastly, I think it’s the most important for you to know that you are NOT alone in your crippling fear of loneliness (ironic, isn’t it?). Lots of INFJs like myself feel the same. We think and feel too much 😂 Once I realized how the core meaning of being human was this horrible, hot loneliness that we all feel burning within—and that a lot of people fear it so much they don’t even put a name to it and spend their time pursuing more aggressive forms of escapism—I felt more at ease. Everything is going through it. Not everyone is aware of it."
