TL;DR The God of the old testament is not the real ONE/OHM (singularity/source). Jesus teaches us that we can be like him (Jesus) and serve each other with love, to get closer to the ONE and for our souls to be truly free. Everyone has the potential to wake up and realize they are another face of the ONE.
