ElectricSkateboarding,fp38wip,t1_fotqe1f,1588275130.0,"I would either take the ownboard or the evolve tbh, if I were in australia, I would've bought the evolve gtr, which doesn't seem to have the lockup problem. Besides, evolve's customer service would be better than ownboard's. A plus for evolve is the pneumatic tires, but it would also be possible to fit them on the ownboard. I wouldn't go with the ranger there won't be to switch out to other types of wheels. Just my two cents from what I've read, I didn't try neither boards."
