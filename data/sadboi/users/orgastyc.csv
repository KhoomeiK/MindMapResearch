Because even with a bigger cage, you still need to give them floor space to exercise regularly and it would be nice if they can exercise through the day instead of only at that specific time. 
But yeah sometimes it sucks to not have enough space as we would like to :/

I think the girl is just showing that she is the boss as usually the dominant pig will hump the others (male or female). 

Another thing is that it looks like your cage is way too small for them, I know they are young now but you should consider building your own C&C or getting the Midwest on amazon for them.

Please don’t get me wrong with the cage suggestion, just saying for the best of you lovely couple <3

Keep getting yourself educated on the topic from people that have gone through the same trauma and shared their stories online, you can probably find so much on Instagram and YouTube. Get your parents to do this research with you, it’s important that all of you are very supportive and educated about it. Once your sister feels comfortable with talking about it, show her them, and show her that even though it’s going to be hard and a lot has changed, she can still do basically anything she wants and have a great life!
