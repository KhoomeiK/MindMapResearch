PiercingAdvice,fqc8xuq,t3_gi2h57,1589252625.0,"that’s definitely pierced in the wrong spot, you should take it out and get it repierced. it looks like it’s through the cartilage at the tip of your nose. the soft spot should be a little bit behind + above that, it feels a lot more flexible and not as dense as the cartilage."
