Infinite Jest helped a lot, and his essays a bit too (though I’ve always found fiction more honest than even memoir), but frankly I just relate to him a lot and find a ton of comfort in looking at another person who, albeit troubled, found ways to cope with and at times overcome his issues. 

By relating to him here I just mean: both Illinois–Boston transplants, mind moving at a million a miles hour constantly, addictive/impressionable personality... none of which I’m proud of but also none of which I’m super urgently trying to change as that’s impossible — but seeing DFW work through what I feel as kind of relatable personal issues, it really helped me a ton. 

TL;DR I don’t aspire to be DFW in any way (he was also just a pretty shitty person overall) but goddamn if he isn’t a Substance recovery role model."

I’m probably biased about Cows because I got to interview Avey the day he came to my town so I always associate the album with those memories. But I think I liked it before. But I really do think it was Avey’s most direct and sing-songey record (it’s the only one I’ve memorized lyrics from), which is great for some people, annoying for others, but for me it was a very cool hybrid of all of his previous work!"

Just seems a little edgy — like obviously his stuff is tough to read, but comparing him with King (and saying the former is worse) is just so clickbaitey.
