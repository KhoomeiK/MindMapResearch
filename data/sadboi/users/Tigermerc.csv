 Find a minimal, modern alternative in a color that replicates the floor. I agree about changing them. Something dark perhaps like granite or faux would work.

I would recommend something done in metal, with finer, straight lines. Perhaps built to carry towards the back wall and continue with the corner until about center line, when looking straight back. So a. MInimal L shape that ends mid wall. Keep the sink in the same spot, but again straighten the lines, find a cheaper modern setup...

Place longer flush to the wall mirror above that. Flush on the right with the width of the new sink and extended until about a foot before wall ends.


Remove the floor pads and install clear glass on the shower. Otherwise hang a slightly off white linen to emphasize the cleanliness of the walls. Include a stone or two to the right of the wash fixture and include a rectangular , narrow lightbulb fixture, or bulb/bar above the mirror..mix a bit of industrial minimalism with a touch of nature.
