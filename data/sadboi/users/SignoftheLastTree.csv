schizoaffective,fr3mpfp,t3_gmanag,1589860854.0,"Im not a doctor or a registered therapist, but it sounds like the trauma is just being enacted over and over again through your illness. Somewhere along the way you received the notion that physical activity is bad and it has created a lifelong pattern of aversion and suffering in relation to anything related to physical activity. Rewiring this conditioning is hard, and likely you will need help from a skilled therapist, and support from people who know what you’re going through. It can be done though. Although my voices don’t function the way you are describing I have lots of similar associations to various activities. My toxic inner critic is a product of the conditions I was raised in a very dysfunctional household. I’ve had to practice self parenting and attending to the parts of me that were rejected by my dysfunctional parents. I can only imagine how painful it must be to be bombarded with the same kinds of messages my mind tells me in similar situations. It sounds like the kind of skills I have been learning and practicing could help you, but it won’t be easy. If you feel like this resonates with you, do some research into self-parenting and the toxic inner critic. It might be a good day place to begin. 

As a side note, I’m a person who has always struggled with his body image. From where I sit, the things that make you a huggable, sexual, youthful, goddess, tigeress have not gone away, they are simply being suppressed by the negative thinking. Your body might not be where you want it, but you’re not defeated, and I think you can find a way back to holding yourself in positive regard. Reaching both physical health and positive self image often go hand in hand, but they can grow independently of one another as well. Learning to honor and love your body can often be a gateway to tackling the physical challenges. Besides, there is nothing more attractive then a woman with a indomitable warrior spirit. Do not give up on yourself, you youthful sexy huggable tiger goddess you.

I hope you find the support and healing you need and deserve. I wish you well."

Perhaps think of this as a higher degree you are working on. If you can heal yourself and emerge through the current set of challenges with wisdom and insight, you will have a whole new perspective to take into your volunteering and other work. The mind will feed you a lot of horseshit about yourself, and even though it’s difficult you ought to challenge those notions. You might emerge from this period with a renewed purpose, you might shift gears. Be open to embracing a new normal. Sometimes the way we think it should be or is going to be gets turned on it head (often times in my case). Just focus on healing yourself. In my experience of similar times, I’m either feeding the negativity in the situation or moving beyond it through my habits. These can be physical habits, or habits of the mind. If I’m stuck in a negative feedback loop, I need to get out of my mind. If I’m telling myself negative stories about myself and my situation, I can seek out and/or create more meaningful ones. If my habits have me feeling stuck, I change things. These don’t have to be grandiose gestures or achieving some sort of lofty spiritual transcendence of my situation. It is often done in small steps. Be wary of latching onto concepts of spiritual transcendence. They can simply be bypassing the real life work of growth and change that needs to be embraced in favor of some concept or idea that is “spiritual,” therefore it should take precedence over what you are actually being confronted with. Often the work is what leads us to a genuine spiritual understanding that is freeing and peaceful. I hope you find the peace and freedom you need. I wish you well."

I had a friend who was felt so guilty about the negative thoughts surrounding his family. The night he opened up about it too me and began to seek support, it began to get way better. He had a conversation with his wife about how he was struggling (not going into every detail), and they came up with ways to take breaks and support each other when things got rough for either of them.

The current craze in materialist scientific thinking is trying to connect everything with genetics, and so far we can’t. It isn’t inherently holistic, and most often is used to preclude other explanations and reinforce the perception that the body is only a biological machine and that consciousness is purely a product of brain activity.

Building focus can definitely cause an increase of delusions and distortions if my mind becomes disregulated. It kind of puts specific concepts and sensations under a microscope and it can be really hard to manage. Overall, meditation has helped me though. I find when the mind is being particularly unruly, I focus on my body, and breath into areas where there is tension or difficult sensations. Even something as simple as doing a progressive body relaxation can help. There are certain qualities of breath that I have found do amp up visual and auditory distortions. Ive found my experience isn’t universal, and I’ve discovered a lot of the benefits and pitfalls through harsh experience so I don’t know how to advise you as to specific technique.

I don’t know if this is relevant to you, but I’ve identified it predominantly as negative patterns and trauma I picked up in my dysfunctional household. Messages about not being good enough and deep discontent and fear of failure. I’ve become aware of the toxic inner critic basically being a reflection of my dysfunctional parents. I internalized a lot of negative messages and developed completely unrealistic expectation for myself. For years I rationalized it the way you did in your post. It wasn’t that bad, it could have been worse, people had it way worse, i should be grateful and quit complaining. It’s not that having gratitude is bad, or that knowing that people have had it worse is bad, it’s the way I used it to try and diminish my own pain and avoid acceptance that my situation was bad. It could always be worse of course, but what I experienced was bad and it fucked me up. It effected me very negatively, and trying to rationalize it away was just another manifestation of that same toxic inner critic. I’ve learned to challenge that inner critic that beat me down time and time again. It didn’t matter what I did, it was never good enough. I was never good enough. Failure always carried such an immense weight and consequence. Something that has helped me is learning how to self parent. How to offer myself support, compassion, and gentle guidance. How to recognize that asshole inner critic, and how to challenge that shit when it arises. I’m not what my conditioning tells me I am. It takes time and effort to both recognize the inner critic at work, and to choose to offer myself compassion, love, and support. I would say, do try to seek out support and insight, but if the money is a huge issue for the particular avenue you are drawn to pick up some books that might help. Concepts like the toxic inner critic, c-ptsd, and self parenting were avenues of huge insight and gateways to healing for me, and I picked it up through books and YouTube more than the myriad of professionals I’ve seen over the years. In other areas and problems, I’ve received awesome help from therapists and counselors, and it might be worth considering and researching different modalities of therapy and see if any of those feel like possibilities for you. Anyway, I hope you find the courage to seek out help, knowledge, and support you need and deserve, and I genuinely hope you take good care of yourself.

I see a lot of people who I am fairly certain are spiritually bypassing various problems people are presenting but I haven’t had the misfortune of seeing what you are describing. It’s unfortunate, but many people use spirituality in the way you are describing. Just because it’s a some sort of lofty concept or idea they’ve latched onto, they think it is superior to people with real life issues at different stages of dealing with that. If someone is telling someone who was a victim of abuse to just quit identifying with it, or trust in god, I think those concepts are ultimately damaging to most people who are seeking help and support. Though some people might come to a genuine spiritual perspective that helps them, interjecting those ideas prematurely can be invalidating, and ultimately promote the same degree of spiritual bypassing within the person if they latch onto the idea without doing the inner work to arrive there on their own.

But his addiction is not about a failing of yours and the fact that he is struggling isn’t even his fault if his intention to stop is honest. He needs to adjust what he is doing, but often relapse is a part of recovery. Based on what you said, he doesn’t want to hurt you and feels like shit when he does. I would suggest him seeking out additional support, knowledge, and practices. If he doesn’t have a solid protocol and plan, he needs one. There are programs that exist, or he can draw from different schools of thought and create one.

In the meantime, I’d rather not create discord in my life and the life of a woman who has the misfortune of being attracted to me.

I spent a lot of my younger years reading different spiritual texts, but was still an atheist up until my mid-twenties. I’ve had major episodes of mental illness, and have been seeing and hearing things other people don’t since my late teens. In the early years I suffered a lot because the context the mental health system offers really hurt me and didn’t give me any degree of meaning or hope from my afflictions. I’ve since found a more balanced, holistic, and nuanced approach. After a moment of awakening in the midst of one of the worst times in my life, I shifted my trajectory and dedicated myself to healing. Within the next few years I developed a spiritual practice through meditation. I experimented with different belief systems, schools of thought, and magic rituals and such but I never identified with a lot of it. I’ve had to build my own cosmology, and through that and my spiritual practice I am more centered in spirit and my calling and purpose. There is this tendency of the mind to want it to be all figured out, to have answers to spiritual questions that are elusive. Part of my path is to wrestle with the questions even if the answers aren’t always forthcoming. I’ve had to learn to find peace in the mystery. If you want answers, there are vast numbers of religions, wisdom schools, and esoteric teachings to dive into that try and make the ineffable more concrete. 

Now the most dangerous part, my advice. ;) All of that to say, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to have it all figured out. If you have guides you can trust, cherish them, but remember that they are also humans who trying to figure it out. Your path might not be their path, even if there is a degree of intersection. Comparison is natural, but it’s a distraction so treat it as such. We often feel resistance as we challenge old patterns or are walking in unfamiliar territory. So long as your learning, practicing, growing, etc. the feelings you are describing are to be expected. If you are here to weave light, you’ll need to bring that light to the dark places within yourself. To do that in a way that doesn’t plummet you into great turmoil, be gentle with yourself and trust the process. These kind of things tend not to conform to our schedule and expectations, so just simply allow it unfold. Develop a practice that connects you to your goal, and adapt it as things develop.

I don’t think there is an easy answer for stuff like this, so just do the best you can. Getting trapped in your own head with a cycle of paranoia and delusions is about the worst thing you can do, so if you have someone you can trust, do some reality checks. Writing also has helped me cope through periods like that. I’ve found that the more I can just get out of my head, even for a little while the better off I am. Taking a walk, listening to some instrumental music, watching a tv show that isn’t triggering, playing a video game, or reading an old book that I love are all things I have used. It can be really hard, but minding the basics is critical. Trying to get good sleep, light exercise, good food, a little social interaction, etc. Anything you can do that is healthy and calms the nervous system will be beneficial: hot showers, baths, deep breathing, progressive body relaxation, etc. It can be really difficult when a lot of the stuff that normally helps isn’t working or is actually triggering. Hold on. This period will pass. Don’t make a decision to hurt yourself right now, it is a permanent decision to a temporary problem.

I know that during the busy season in particular there is a greater influx of people and stress, so I take better care of myself both in and out of work. I pay attention to how I’m feeling at work, and I use my breaks to release tension (music, a short walk, stretching, breathing). I bring food and drink so my blood sugar doesn’t get too low and I’m not hangry or dehydrated. I also let my boss know upfront that I want to know ways I could do a better job or if something I’m doing isn’t right. I think that can go a long way.

The other thing I hope you’ll keep in mind is that it can take time to find a job that is a good fit, and the right people to work for and with. It can be really frustrating and disheartening when you are giving it your best and it still doesn’t work. I spent years in and out of jobs, long periods of not working, and if I could tell me back then one thing it would be to not give up. It can be damn hard at times not to feel defeated. But don’t give up. Willingness and persistence are the keys to victory. If a job doesn’t work out, take the time you need, but don’t quit and try to find another one.

Meditation,fqgtfe5,t3_giimjj,1589356539.0,"If you are building focus and concentration on the cushion (or chair in my case), when you face the outside world that can laser you into different things that arise. The sensations/feelings can be more intense. During most meditation there is an object of focus: the breath, bodily sensations, etc. If the mind is still focused and you let it off the leash so to speak, your fear might become intense and overwhelming. Something I’ve experienced personally and that understanding has helped me be more careful and embody my practice more apart from the time I set aside to sit. That to say, I’m not neurotypical and I  experience things like that frequently in my day to day life and within my practice, just now without the fear (might be a little startled ;) ). It’s all one big mystery. Are these projections of the mind? Are there beings and realms that exist beyond standard perceptual experiences? There are many schools of thought on these sort of things and you can choose what to believe, or not as the case may be. I wish you well."

I’m a thinky type too, and during these kinds of experiences the mind can become an obstacle. It is constantly trying to rationalize, explain, creat narratives that are knowable and workable within or existing confines. When we realize much of reality is constructed, those structures can start to have cracks in them, and awareness expands. The mind really doesn’t know what to do, and we panic. It can be argued that much of life is beyond our ability to control. As a concept, it is difficult for the mind to grapple with the unknown and uncontrollable, as it wants to know, define, create narratives, provide structure, etc. I have found, that when I am in the midst of grasping with the mind at the unknowable and uncontrollable, the best thing to do is to surrender to what is. This takes significant practice. I catch myself doing it, and note to myself “here is your mind doing it’s mind thing.” That way I don’t get wrapped up in the fear, confusion, and uncertainty my mind is trying to think it’s way out of. Many thinky types like us have a hard time with deep acceptance of the unknown and the uncontrollable, in my experience. Often, we can’t think our way out of it, at least not in the way the mind is conditioned to think.

Some difficult truths I’ve arrived at that ultimately were gateways to freedom: There are things we can’t know, and may never know, and that is okay. Much of life is out of our hands, and if I can get past the initial discomfort and helplessness at that prospect, I am no longer causing myself suffering trying to direct things that are way beyond me. There is a profound freedom in surrender. The nature of this reality is impermanence, when I quit freaking out about that I can pay more attention and operate from a standpoint of gratitude which gives me a richer experience then operating from a standpoint of scarcity, lack, and grasping.

Through many experiences that I feel are similar to what you are describing, I’ve learned to listen and observe more than rationalize. I’m still a thinky type of guy, but I’m not so attached to the concepts and structures the mind creates. More of an explorer and a researcher then trying to find or create any specific belief or structure in particular. I put my efforts into service and loving the people in my life. Anyhow, I hope your experience improves and leaves wisdom in its wake. I wish you well."

schizoaffective,fqgdjl1,t3_gimuay,1589343553.0,"You aren’t alone in struggling with fasting. It is difficult to adapt to with underlying mental health concerns, and fasting too hard can throw you way off psychologically. Intermittent fasting is a great balance. Start by doing 16 hour fast with an eight hour eating window. Spend a few weeks doing that until it gets easy and then try a smaller window like 18:6. If you are feeling weak look into electrolyte supplements you can add to water during a fast, they can really help especially in longer fasts. There are calculators online that can tell you what your maintenance calories roughly are at your height and weight and a sedentary lifestyle. Don’t dramatically cut calories but shoot for a 400-500 deficit. My daily requirement is 2200 (I’m 6 ft 7), so I shout for 1700-1800. I’m not militant about it. That’s my protocol. I only eat once a day these days but I have quite a bit of fasting experience under my belt, and I don’t have any issue with it. I’ve lost about 40lbs. It is very important to make changes gradually, and to listen to your body. If you feel bad or are having an increase in symptoms pull back and reassess. If you slip up, simply try to do better the next day. We want the weight to be gone yesterday, but it can be really tricky with a mental health condition and with side effects from meds. It’s taken me 7-8 months to lose the weight I have and I still have a ways to go, but I had to pull back over the holidays cause I was really stressed out and needed not to push myself too hard. Treat it like a marathon, not a race. If we consistently strive for a goal, adapt to changes/limitations, and keep searching for optimal methods we will break through. It’s not a matter of if it’s a matter of when. Be patient with yourself, and take good care of yourself along the way. I wish you luck on your journey!"
NoFap,fqew97a,t1_fqec0yt,1589314626.0,"What it evokes in you is exactly what I’m getting at. Our associations tend to lump those things all together. Whether we like it or not, lustfulness is a component of sexuality. The choice becomes what do we do with something that evokes a feeling of lustfulness. If we have a deep seated aversion to feeling of lustfulness or horniness, it will conjure up guilt, shame, and all the other crap that goes with this addiction. I think people who are resilient are able to see the same images, it just doesn’t put them into shame, guilt, and turmoil as someone who is trying to beat an addiction to porn. They can be aroused, or lustful, but they don’t feel compelled to engage in something that is harmful to process that feeling, or to avoid it. You literally have to rewire your brain by holding those feelings and choosing to react differently. It takes time. It is gradual. Simply saying to yourself “I’m feeling a lot of shame because of the history I have with similar material, but I don’t need to act on it. It is okay to come across material like this, because I know I’m not going to indulge my addiction.” It helps bring these patterns of conditioning into conscious awareness. When we interacting with the material, and most importantly what arises within us as a response to the material, we can begin to pick apart the unhealthy elements at play, and try and build new neuronal connections by thinking something different or making a healthy choice. This kind of work is not easy to do and should probably not be attempted until one is more secure in their recovery. It takes practice. It is much easier to get lost in the negative emotions and associations. None of this is to say you should seek out triggering material. But it is bound to happen. Trying to gently remind yourself that a woman in a bikini is okay to happen upon, but reinforcing the fact that you are choosing not to overly indulge in fantasy or other addictive behaviors will build up resilience. What we resist persists, and strong aversion to such material is totally understandable, but ultimately I think creates some of the underlying responses and conditioning you are experiencing. Either way, I hope you find a healthy way to deal with this situation and I wish you well."

NoFap,fqcy8st,t3_gi5h75,1589273067.0,"I don’t know if this applies to you, but it came to mind after reading your post. I think a lot of guys try to obliterate their sexuality in response to their addiction. Everything sexual becomes a trigger, anything mildly suggestive gets associated with the addiction and therefore bad, and at its worst, sexuality and sexual attraction itself become undesirable and cause us to suffer. For most people, I think adopting a protective attitude and limiting exposure to stuff is okay and probably advisable especially early on. But as time goes on, unless the goal is to become a true monastic of some sort, I think it can be beneficial to try and integrate sexuality back into our live in healthy ways. We obliterated our sexual selves with PMO, and now we are ironically doing it from the opposite perspective. I don’t know what your goals are, but I seek to have a healthy relationship with sexuality. I want to be able to come across suggestive things, recognize the fact that I’m aroused, and be okay with that knowing the fact that I’m still not going to engage in my addiction. This is where we learn to use the sexual drive and the sexual energy for alternate things. But we have to be okay with sexuality, and understand that it is everywhere, and why shouldn’t it be? It’s what allowed us to come into existence. That doesn’t mean I have to particularly enjoy the way sexuality is weaponized to sell me crap, or that much of it exploitative. It is admittedly different, but I’ve managed to build that sort of relationship when it comes to drugs I was very addicted to and quit many years ago. Just my two cents."

There are people who we have some sort of special bond to, but I don’t believe in this concept as a whole. Be careful you’re not just beating your head against a wall in a painful and toxic relationship because you think your souls are meant for each other. Magical thinking when it comes to these kind of intense relationships can ultimately cause a lot of damage, to both parties. I still love her, I still feel connected to her, and I still wish nothing but good things for her, but it was never meant to be anything more then what it was. The multiple attempts to be a part of her life only hurt more. Those intense and tumultuous  relationships often exist to deliver us powerful messages and teachings.

Depression to me is exactly what you are describing. Energetically speaking, it is the absence of energy. Surrender to the lack of energy and see what is really going on. Are your habits draining you? Are your relationships draining you? Is it something internally that’s happening? When we feel terrible, the mind starts trying to rationalize why it’s happening, and if we aren’t careful we can create some powerful false narratives that deepen the cycle of confusion, feeling lost, and suffering. The negative stories circulating in your mind are likely not true. Find ways to challenge the negative thinking. It helps me to perceive the negative inner critic and doomsayer as something external. If I’m not identifying so strongly with all the negative thoughts and emotions, they don’t harm me as much. You haven’t lost your spiritual energy, your experiencing a dip, and it could be for a reason. I’ve gone through many such periods, and though it is often difficult to see at the time, they are serving a purpose, even if that purpose isn’t easy to identify in the moment, and most importantly, they always pass. Mind the basics: good food, sleep, exercise, positive self talk, meditation, try and learn something new, etc. It can be difficult, and might seem trivial or a waste of time, but it is essential we take care of the body so we don’t make things worse.

Traditional talk therapy can kinda cause you to relive the experience and unless the therapist is really good it can be a real mixed bag. As for psychedelics, be cautious. They can help shift perspective and certain ones can help redo the neurology of the brain, but if there is serious darkness lurking there, they can also bring that stuff to the surface. Not saying that wouldn’t be helpful, but there is also a risk of serious turmoil. I would expend some energy and time doing research into trauma and different modalities of healing.

When I’ve helped train police officers in my community about mental health crisis and the guys come up and shake my hand and tell me the information I’m giving them is saving lives, it’s worth way more then mass recognition, fame, money, etc. Find something you’d be good at that is meaningful to you and walk that path for awhile and see how things change.

schizoaffective,fq7eis1,t3_gh93be,1589145349.0,"I used to be a shut in, avoiding most forms of socializing. I had terrible anxiety about meeting new people and being in new social situations. The friendships I did have I kinda always kept people at arms length and was afraid to talk about what I experienced. It was pretty lonely, and I told myself a lot of the stuff you are telling yourself now. “I’ll always be alone, it’s better to be alone, I’m incapable of interacting because of my condition, etc.” After another episode of psychosis I resolved to change and decided I was going to be open about myself and my condition. It took some time for me to feel on solid ground again after being hospitalized, but I tried to step out of my comfort zone. If someone asked me to hang out or to go do something, I made the effort to try and do it. I didn’t say yes all the time, but I tried to challenge the fear I had built up around talking to people. I started going to support groups and ended up facilitating them. I began to speak openly about my condition to friends, doctors, and to my family, with mixed results. What began as baby steps fully brought me out of my shell. I do mental health advocacy work now and speak to large groups of people, including cops (which was really difficult at first because of my paranoia), about my mental health condition. I have actual friendships now because I allowed myself to be vulnerable and showed people who I really was. It didn’t work out perfectly all the time. I’ve been hurt by people who didn’t understand. I’ve also had some really embarrassing and devastating events during episodes of psychosis with people I’ve cared about. But it is so much easier fighting that fear than being controlled by it. There is nothing that says people that have conditions like this can’t find love and relationships. I find friendships more valuable and meaningful then romantic relationships because I’ve got a lot of baggage in addition to my condition that makes romance incredibly difficult. If you’re interested in challenging that fear, I would suggest doing it little by little. Conversation is a skill like anything else and the truth is, illness or not, a lot of people are self conscious when they talk to people and meet new people. Practice, practice, practice.

This can become kind of a rabbit hole that goes to some pretty bizarre places so be careful. The way I see it, what I experience is real, but the important identifier is that other people are not experiencing it. The things I see haven’t physically been able to hurt me. I know something is up because I’ve seen animals, mainly cats and birds, looking at the same weird shit I see. Now is this a super power? Maybe. But it comes with some heavy liabilities. The way I choose to see it is this: my baseline state isn’t mentally ill, I just perceive the world through a different lens. Now, when that world collides with what I refer to as consensus reality shit can get really messy and I am very susceptible to genuine mental illness and serious disregulation. But my visual and auditory distortions are real, they’re just generally not being perceived by those around me. If you want to be a wizard, you have to learn to walk in both worlds, and keep your footing. Which for me means taking my meds at this point in time. I explore the alternate perceptions through spiritual practice and meditation, but I am careful not to get too lost in the sauce. There is valuable insight to be gained from the distortions I experience. When things get weird I pay close attention to what is going on internally and what is going around me. I’ve had to practice this. I can be having an experience of a melting room with everything becoming liquid and malleable, while I’m working on an essay for college (brag: it was an A paper). Anyway, I think we all get to decide what stories we tell ourselves about our experiences. We can both accept our condition and treatment without accepting and internalizing the stigma and invalidation we are subjected to. I spent many years with the “it’s not real, I’m sick” kinda mindset, but those kind of rationalizations ultimately made me sicker, and they definitely didn’t make the experience itself any better. I think it’s important not to fight the reality of our experience, and that also includes the need to accept help, pursue treatment, and stay connected to people trying to help us. Within our culture and the current institutional perspectives on all of this, it can be a fine line to walk. Good luck!"

Pick a day, once a week, and weigh yourself at the same time, after the same conditions.

I am struggling with the same thing, so I’ve committed to a period of celibacy to try and even out. Remember, sexuality and sexual energy are not the enemy. My goal is to have a healthy integrated sexual self, so the period of celibacy is kind of a means to that end, but at this point I’m not trying to obliterate my sexual self, that’s kinda what I was doing in my addiction.

As for partners, the example you cited was a guy just trying to get what he wanted without being considerate of your feelings and emotional state and it sounds like you made the right call on a multitude of levels in leaving that situation. I’m a dude who doesn’t date much, so it is different, but I’ve really had to work on setting healthy boundaries with people. People want you to be the person they’ve made up in their head more than the person you are. I’ve done the same thing to certain women in my life, and it’s hurt us both. I find it difficult to convey certain realities I’m swimming in to some people, but I still try to do it. At the end of the day, whether they accept what I’m putting forth or not, I have to do what is best for me. I don’t try and find a lot of mental health support from my parents, they seem to cycle between overbearing, controlling, dysfunctional caretaking to outright obliviousness and ignorance when it comes to my condition. They help me financially some, but I don’t go to them for advice or emotional support. I kinda believe our ability to achieve rewarding intimate relationships (romantic or not) is largely determined by our capacity to be honest, open, and vulnerable. Does that mean I get hurt sometimes when people don’t accept me? Absolutely, but it’s the only way to have intimacy so it can be worth the risk. If someone doesn’t accept my authenticity, or is dragging me into something that makes me uncomfortable, I always politely enforce a boundary. If that doesn’t work, I can hit them with a little less flowery form of honesty. It can be a lot to manage my condition, and most of the people in my life have little interest in what that looks like for me. As much as it can be lonely and isolating, I kinda accept it, and just hope that I will meet more people willing to meet me halfway. I wish you well, and I’m sure you will find people who accept you and all the challenges you face. Be good to yourself and if something doesn’t feel right within a relationship I’d suggest practicing self care, honesty, and setting appropriate boundaries."
NoFap,fpxpr9t,t1_fpxg62a,1588987112.0,"Your perception of it as frustration is not how I choose to characterize it. You have pent up energy that you think can only be expressed through sexual activity or PMO. In my experience, that simply isn’t true. I think a lot of the people that have success learn to apply that energy to other things, like self improvement. Some might argue that going through difficulty and facing challenges with integrity is a necessary component of self improvement. I’m not trying to tell you what to do, but you seem to be adopting a defeatist attitude instead of trying to make it work for you. Good luck with whatever you decide."
NoFap,fpwqgby,t3_gfuw4l,1588968090.0,"Not a Muslim but I am observing Ramadan this year and it has helped me get back in track in terms of food and this addiction. Good for you man, happy fasting!"
NoFap,fpwq39w,t3_gfyiz6,1588967905.0,"The point as I see it is to quit wasting your sexual energy and put it towards self improvement, your relationships, etc. A lot of stuff can come up when we quit. Frustration is an element for most of us. The point of it for me is to quit an addiction, and learn to live with and use sexual energy in productive and healthy ways. I’m not doing this to get laid, or find superpowers, I’m doing this because it’s another step along the path of self actualization. If you struggle with the sexual energy, do what a lot of people here suggest and go get some exercise, learn to meditate, try and socialize with women, etc. Quitting PMO is only the beginning step and for a lot of people it doesn’t lead to magical transformations in and of itself. You gotta work it. Good luck! I wish you well."

NoFap,fptnjau,t3_gf5dmz,1588894605.0,"Whatever works. I don’t run around shouting it from the rooftops, but I am honest with the people close to me whether they understand it or not. Being vulnerable is a part of intimacy and you can’t have that if you hide the truth. I’m not overly concerned with people validating me though when it comes to recovery from my addictions. If they get it, it’s great, if they think less of me for it that says more about them then it says about me. It’s a hell of a lot easier to be open and honest at 31 then it was when I was younger."
spirituality,fptmi1j,t3_gfh253,1588894042.0,"Yeah, aversion is just the flip side of endlessly grasping. I don’t seek the elevated states, and I don’t go out of my way to avoid the negative ones. I practice self care when I’m dealing with something difficult or upsetting but I try to *avoid* avoidance. It’s just kind of the paradoxical nature of it all. I think the principles and practice of non-attachment and identification help me the most not to get lost in the sauce."
awakened,fptm193,t3_gfcwox,1588893786.0,"A dream within a dream within a dream. Awakening isn’t a state for me so much as a process. I am continually awakening, and at many points I’ve thought to myself “Wow, I’m really getting it!” or “Now I have the true knowledge!” only to find another layer, and another one, and another one...I guess I look at the state of being “awake” as being mindful, conscious of self and surroundings, and grounded in spiritual truth. Within those terms I am not always awake, but I don’t let it bother me."
schizoaffective,fptled6,t3_gfg2qu,1588893439.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through that right now. I hope you find what you need at the hospital, and I hope this experience your having passes quickly. Try and take good care of yourself during this time: good food, light exercise/stretching, staying off electronics before bed, etc. It can be really hard to do, but treating yourself right and minding the basics can definitely help things from getting worse. I wish you well."
energy_work,fppj02b,t1_fppcxst,1588803158.0,It doesn’t have to define you. That’s the whole point of healing from it.
energy_work,fppa1au,t3_gep32o,1588798542.0,"Somatic work is a way to address trauma in the body through means that aren’t centered in talking about and reliving your trauma. EMDR is another modality that isn’t focused on storytelling and is also effective at addressing trauma. I did do some talk therapy, but it was a very mixed bag. It didn’t always help and was really hard. I’ve used meditation to gain insight and distance from my thoughts so I don’t become possessed by the traumatic responses and narratives. I’m 31 now, and it’s much easier then it was when I was younger after learning different techniques and gaining insight into how the trauma conditioned me to respond to certain situations. It’s a very hard thing to address these kind of things. It takes a brave person to try and heal, so I commend you. I wish you success on your healing journey. Don’t give up."

depression,fpmpfcy,t3_ge8qpj,1588738332.0,"I’ve gone through many ups and downs struggling with my mental health and it’s a part of the game my friend. You aren’t disappointing people by including them in your struggle. If anything, I know people have been disappointed when I didn’t let them know what was happening. There is nothing wrong with you as a person. Your not fucking up because you aren’t feeling well. You aren’t a failure because you’ve hit a rough patch and are going through it again. You are trying to cope with it on your own, and that is admirable. But it is also unnecessary and not in your best interest. You can be selective about who you let know, but be courageous and reach out to a couple of people whom you trust AND who can help you. No one should have to go it alone. Your feelings aren’t invalid just cause other people may have it worse. You are having a hard time, and that is that. Try reaching out and also please take good care of yourself. I wish you well."
