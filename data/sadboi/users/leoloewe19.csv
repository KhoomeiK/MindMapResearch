Put it all on a baking tray, put 2-3 spoons of olive oil (every other oil works just as well) on it, add salt, pepper and rosmary. Mix it well. 

If you want, you can add some diced feta.

Bake it at 200° Celsius for 20 min.

I will keep it uo as long as it makes me feel better, so no plan there, I might also switch to 14:10 if it is to hard.

right now I find it hard to have 3 meals in that short time frame, because I am not hungry when the next meal comes so I might have to eat smaller portions. Today I only had two meals and some fruitsnacks but I will eat something later so I won't get hungry duribg fasting.

rats don't like the smell of cleaners, so you sgould mostly clean with hot water only.
What do you use inside of the cage? Some things are smellier than others - wood smells way more than plastic, in my experience blankets smell pretty fast etc.
Also rats like to have everything smell a bit like them. it could actually be that you are cleaning to much.
try to clean only one time a week and on the other days just clean the toilets (or pick up the poo) and change the inlay of their favorite house. Make sure to remove leftovers from vegetables etc.

TLDR: don't use cleaners, use plastic rather than wood, only deep clean once a week and just do the worst places the other days"
