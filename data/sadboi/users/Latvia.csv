I will say, religion carries some extra consequences that other ideologies don’t, so I’m all for its decline. And I would argue it’s the most harmful type of ideology. But humans gonna hume.

DebateAnAtheist,fqu8nxo,t1_fqtifnw,1589654166.0,"If your religion doesn’t tell you your morals, it ceases to have a purpose. That’s literally its entire job, to tell people what they believe (and usually to profit the leaders of the religion). Religion, at its very best, the absolute best case scenario, is innocuous, completely unnecessary. 

And that would be if religion taught “we may be completely wrong about all of this, so behave with that in mind...” but it never does. We have never had the absolute best case scenario. Virtually always, religion teaches things that are simply not true, or teaches things as settled truth that can never be confirmed as such. And that, in and of itself is harmful, always. Not to even get into the range of harms directly caused by individual religions that would not happen without the religion. 

That’s why people are against it. It teaches an understanding of the world that simply isn’t true. That never leads to anything good, usually leads to something bad, and often leads to some of the worst things humanity can come up with."

When people stop believing in some ideology, they are free to think and assess reality from a far less biased view. The only things I think everyone should “believe in” are truth and compassion.

Almost every time, it is adherence to a leader or source of authority, and loyalty to said authority even when the values change. Conservatism is a non religious ideology (very married to religion, but religion is not required to be “conservative”). And I’d argue it’s as harmful as many religions.

Virtually every bit of social, technological, and moral progress humans have made, and that we all (theist or not) agree are good, has been first implemented by science and humanism, not religion.

Religion IS a mental disorder. At its very best, it gives people a view of the world that is by nature completely unconfirmable, and leads to less importance being placed on things that ARE confirmable. Worst case is what you’re seeing, only magnify it. Clearly religion didn’t cause the struggles your wife is experiencing. But it has given them an extremely dangerous outlet, and magnified them tremendously. That’s what it does. Magnifies negative qualities and calls into question positive ones (is this person befriending me because they like me or to convert me? etc). 

I only bring it up because if you were only facing a very stressed person with some mental health issues, that’s one thing. But we’ve added this nearly impenetrable layer of religious dogma that will obliterate rational conversation about how to resolve the issue. When your beliefs aren’t rational, your solutions can’t be either, and that’s not good for you. You’re gonna have to address the religion before you can even begin to crack into the personal issues.

ableton,fnxiecf,t1_fnx395j,1587339268.0,"Sorry- I just thought of a better way to ask what I’m trying to understand. Since there are two separate versions of a given track, one for session view and one for arrangement view, if I were to export my project as a song (.wav format or whatever), which of the two versions would be exported? The one in session view or the one in arrangement view?"
ableton,fnxi2v2,t1_fnx395j,1587339079.0,"Thank you. I guess that helps me understand that I still don’t understand haha. Ok, so is session view just basically toying with the sounds and arrangement view is actually putting something together?"

So I am much better at timed games with max 15 minutes total. It makes sense that someone could sneak in a victory against a chess master in those conditions. I’m sure that 16 year old would annihilate me 100% of the time, timed game or not, but still."

mormon,fnnkxhs,t3_g12bqw,1587094807.0,"While there is definitely a lot of criticism of the church on exmormon and less here, it’s silly to suggest it only comes from “rage and pain.” I don’t have any emotions regarding the church, haven’t since the second I snapped out of the delusion. But the church is objectively atrocious in some pretty far reaching ways. And it earns the criticism. Most of the “negativity” is just honesty, without sugar coating or worrying about making anyone uncomfortable. I think that’s the difference. This sub is more “walking on eggshells” with controversial issues, which has its place because it makes those issues more accessible to a broader range of people. The exmormon sub is not trying to cater to the world (as much), but rather is a place to be honest and open without censorship."
DebateAnAtheist,fnllk01,t3_g2hsuh,1587055605.0,"A) Classic case of “I don’t have the answer therefore god.” This has never been a good approach. Keep in mind that everything from the movement of the sun to the existence of disease has been attributed to gods because “there’s just no other explanation”... until there is. But even if we never explain some given phenomenon, this argument reduces the definition of god to “the default explanation for things we don’t understand,” which is honestly a pretty good definition, for those who believe in gods. 

B ) Complexity just is. What is the alternative? You’re suggesting a universe that is highly complex could only have been orchestrated by a god. So what exactly would a non-god, purely naturally occurring universe look like in your opinion? 

C) Things in the universe are not “just right.” They just are. If you mean “just right for the existence of humans,” then still not really. This one chunk of elements in this one mass of other elements happens to support life. The size of the universe is incomprehensible. Billions of galaxies like ours exist. Maybe trillions. We have managed to collect some data on the surrounding space for a significant distance, and can barely find a handful of other planets that even COULD support life, and the nearest one would take something like 300 years to get to traveling in the fastest spacecraft we’ve ever created. Which is about what you’d expect statistically. 

It *feels* like this was created for us. “Why US?” “Why does it just happen to be that we are the special ones?” Like I say, probability. Life happened. It appears that it is extremely rare. But here we are. We became self aware. And became pretty damn smart. Which is really cool. We should take advantage by continuing to get smarter by not giving into the temptation of “I can’t make sense of this so only something absurdly powerful and intelligent could.” It’s an oddly arrogant view when you think about it. I don’t think it’s intentionally arrogant, but it’s really arrogant."

relationship_advice,fnhqa4i,t3_g1s4xy,1586966978.0,"I hate when people say “I’m not really into politics.” Unfortunately, “politics” includes really important issues and what someone’s beliefs are about those issues, as you are finding out the hard way. We all have beliefs about how people should interact, what is fair, what is acceptable, etc. All of that is unalterably affixed to politics. We’ve let social pressure bully us into treating “politics” (which encompasses virtually every issue important to society) as taboo. As something that “good people” are above. Anyway your gf is a racist."

exmormon,fnexcos,t1_fned12t,1586897598.0,"Ok, bear with me on this, but watch the whole Bojack Horseman series. It starts really slow in my opinion, but is enjoyable enough that you kinda want to keep watching. By season 3 or 4, they’re touching on every kind of relationship you can imagine. As well as some intense life issues. It’s usually pretty decent, but occasionally mind blowing. It may not be exactly what you were thinking, but I think it will sneakily open your mind up to new ways of thinking about personal relationships in general."

I said to my still very Mormon brother, “You can come up with an explanation for each of these literally hundreds of inconsistencies, and maybe each explanation can suffice on its own, but the mere fact that you HAVE to come up with that many explanations is a huge red flag. Truth doesn’t work that way.”"
DebateAnAtheist,fnduo0q,t1_fndtt3m,1586877821.0,"I am an exmormon. The founder, Joseph Smith, stated it would be in his lifetime. Theists are amazing at ignoring things that don’t match what they already believe. Like, in the real world, when you find out something wasn’t true, you change your view. “I can’t find my keys. I’m pretty sure I left them in my coat pocket.” Sees keys on countertop. “Hmmmm yeah I know they’re visible, right now, on the countertop, buuuuut I’m pretty sure I left them in my coat pocket. I’m gonna keep looking in there until they’re in there.” That’s literally the same logic. I can’t judge too hard, I used to be there but damn."
