BPD,fjhwwd5,t3_fda1fr,1583356554.0,"I feel like I'm reading about myself, really. At the beggining of day I can be super confident, thinking that I look good and that's going to be MY DAY, but all of a sudden someone makes a comment, even without intention of actually hurting me and here we are. I again feel like worthless, unattractive piece of crap. (PS. sorry for my english, it's not my native language)"
