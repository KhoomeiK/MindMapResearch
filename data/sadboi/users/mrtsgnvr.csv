DebateAnAtheist,f9qc2rm,t3_e66nug,1575558681.0,"I've got a couple of thoughts that may or may not be helpful. 

So In regards to your ""evidences"":

1. This only seems to be relevant because meeting the prophet caused you to follow through on a decision that impacted your life. If we break down what actually happened though, You met the prophet at the temple where you often saw the prophet. Personally I see nothing ""miraculous"" about that. 

Also, If you had not met the prophet would you still attribute your decision to stay in the team to God? If so then you're using an ordinary situation (meeting or not meeting the prophet) as an evidence for God even though one of these things was always going to happen.

2. You were told you were ""doing something terrible for your spirit"" and that's it. You attributed what happened to this. Had you not seen porn you would probably have attributed it to something else. Such as something in the video game, maybe you or your friend swore. Any number of things could be used to fill this gap if you're accepting something MUST fill it.

&#x200B;

And in regards to prayer in general I personally have some issues:

If we accept that God doesn't grant every prayer, and also that things can happen without praying for them, how are you deciding what things you attribute to God? And are you actually sure they should be attributed to God?

If you can accept that you've got no good reason to attribute these things to a God, and these things are also what's keeping the idea that a God even exists alive, then I think you're ready to let God go (at least until some good evidence comes along to prove he exists).

If you can't accept that celebrity is something different from what it was 50 years ago then fine, but I disagree. I've heard people argue that someone is a celebrity because they're a on a ""TV Show"" that get's a few hundred thousand viewers but then go onto say that someone that's in youtube videos that get at least ten times as many viewers are not and this makes little other than ""It's not the same, boohoo"".

What is it that makes someone a ""celebrity"" for you? Is it simply the platform they use to distribute their content? Or is it that you think the status celebrity is reserved for those with an evident talent, regardless of how many people know about them? (what about bad actors on big shows? Still celebrity?) 

I genuinely want to know!

That said, i'll be honest, i'm only following these comments up because i'm bored, it doesn't really matter though does it? It's a post of someone that is ""arguably"" a celebrity on a subreddit people use to view well known people in limited clothing. This isn't a battle worth fighting.

I'd guess not, because it's extremely unlikely and you've got not good reason to believe it's an accurate documentation of reality. The same goes for the Quran, even if it contains no scientific errors there's no evidence that what it says is infact true. Only that it could be true.

If this God does prove true, honestly, as much as i'd like to say ""i'd be the bigger person and berate such an immoral deity for the disgusting world he's created and allowed to continue to exist etc."", if he's anywhere near as psychopathic and indecisive as the God of the bible (and given they're both Abrahamic, I imagine he is) I think i'd do as he says until I die and then see what happens.

Because if it's anything close to ""The universe is perfect because God says it's perfect and God is always right."" then in my opinion it's not a discussion worth having because they've already decided that no matter what happens in this universe, it is good because God is good. 

If however they're open to the idea it may not be perfect, then I like to start with the fact that the universe is incomprehensibly large and we live on an extremely tiny rock, and of that rock, 71% of the surface is covered in water, and of the land, only 71% of that in habitable. So we can only live on about 21% of the surface of this rock.

Then look at what's going on down here. Hundreds of millions of people live in extreme poverty, lack access to clean water that kills millions of people (the big guy seemingly though it necesary to include those diseases). Millions starve and go without needed food. And us humans, we a selfish bunch and will go to war over pretty much anything. 

Maybe the universe is perfect for something, but it's clearly not humans. And if this IS what perfection looks like in Gods eyes then he either needs to get his eyes checked or he's even more psychopathic than the old testament makes out.

Also, the burden is on them to prove it was created. Then there's a shit load more work to do in regards to determining if this creator is ANYTHING close to what they believe is their God. 

If it's a simulation for example, it would have a creator and intent, but the desires of said creator may be nowhere near what their holy book claims, thus not being their God (although, i'm sure the pope would be more than happy to ""adapt"" their belief system and score it as a win).

DebateAnAtheist,f2vuxet,t3_dehrji,1570457712.0,"Personally it comes down to the known high risk of disabilities in children should the couple get pregnant. 
But I do concede that I'm doubtful you'll ever find me protesting against an unrelated couple having children when both of them have genetic disabilities of their own.

Incestuous relationships between homosexual people I can't really argue against though as it doesn't directly impact anyone other than those partaking in the activity. 

My position is far from solid on this topic but I think it would have to come down to societal acceptance and how that would impact one's life. 
Being in such a relationship could bring hatred and disgust toward yourself and your family and potentially case you to be segregated from a society from which you require a certain level of acceptance to survive. 
Assuming survival is a primary goal, being in an Incestuous relationship could actively work against this, thus making it ""bad"".

But I guess I don't really think it's ""wrong"" so much as unappealing and societally unacceptable...

TrueAtheism,f2vqqe0,t3_dehpjh,1570456192.0,"For me it comes down to the scientific method. 
I HAVE studied what this is. It works and should be trusted. 
Because of this I know that I can trust the conclusions scientists come to using the scientific method without having to know and comprehend every single thing they've done.

If the don't use this method it's NOT science and I don't place the same trust in the validity of a claim.

Also, because of the methods used, you yourself can go out and repeat what the scientists had done to reach their conclusions and you'll achieve the same results.
Like when you did basic science experiments in school.


You're not blindly trusting a person, you're confidently trusting a methodology of determining what is and is not true."
