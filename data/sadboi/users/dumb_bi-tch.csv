EDanonymemes,fkc5kdu,t1_fkc55bv,1584046216.0,usually any acknowledgement of me eating makes me upset but this very specific type of comment is my favorite thing lol
EDanonymemes,fkc52kg,t1_fkc4q16,1584045940.0,yes omg exactly. iâ€™d just been feeling bad about how much iâ€™ve been eating but to have someone recognize itâ€™s a difficult thing for me to do and then make it something positive? ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°

StopSelfHarm,fh1tf23,t3_f11y70,1581223661.0,"https://www.doesthedogdie.com is one of my favorite websites for that kind of thing! It lists pretty much every common trigger for movies/shows, plus some. And for dealing with triggers, it depends on what helps the individual but Iâ€™ve found that the most effective ways of staying distracted are ones that keep my mind and hands busy"

EDanonymemes,fgxhfk9,t1_fgxbgcu,1581172845.0,ahaha iâ€™m not sure how that happened i didnâ€™t expect it to start anything
EDanonymemes,fgwo93h,t1_fgwnn7m,1581163896.0,thank you that means a lot to hear :)
EDanonymemes,fgwlyla,t1_fgwlfls,1581162838.0,jeez dude i just wanted to make a meme about a friend who unintentionally triggered me i didnâ€™t mean for it to turn into a big thing. obviously the topic of food is going to be a sensitive one considering where youâ€™re commenting. this argument is pointless
EDanonymemes,fgwcngp,t1_fgwc9cr,1581159642.0,iâ€™m glad you try to make the choice that makes sense to you. thats what iâ€™m doing too.
EDanonymemes,fgwb0i3,t1_fgwahna,1581159088.0,i donâ€™t have the energy to continue this conversation but please keep in mind that you donâ€™t know what my situation is. thank you for sharing your opinions with me but iâ€™m not interested in repeating the same argument i just had
EDanonymemes,fgw8nfi,t1_fgw5ql6,1581158217.0,"or maybe iâ€™m working on allowing myself to enjoy foods, and part of that is eating foods that i like and can afford and have easy access to"
misophonia,fgvcuf2,t1_fgvcs91,1581144903.0,Haha no I think I just didnâ€™t think about how that comment would sound out of context youâ€™re all good
misophonia,fgvcpr9,t1_fgvc9vl,1581144752.0,"Hey Iâ€™m really sorry but I phrased the allergy part the wrong way. She isnâ€™t in danger and I didnâ€™t mean to make it sound like she is. They believe that she has allergies, and were very concerned when she had a reaction. She has an epipen and they have gotten her medical help when needed. I mentioned it because she told me she was scared they wouldnâ€™t take her problem seriously specifically because of rude comments theyâ€™ve made about her allergies"
misophonia,fguheuu,t1_fguh2rf,1581120871.0,"Yeah I didnâ€™t think about how that would sound, I maybe should have worded it a bit different lol. And I do think theyâ€™ll come around eventually itâ€™s just that Iâ€™d like to do whatever I can to help for the time being. Thank you so much, Iâ€™ll try to find some videos to help explain it to them!"
misophonia,fgugp6p,t1_fgufbg6,1581120359.0,Thank you that means a lot to me :) and Iâ€™m glad you had your sister to look out for you
misophonia,fgugi94,t1_fgufiy2,1581120225.0,"aw iâ€™m sorry to hear that, everyone deserves at least someone to pay attention to their problems"
misophonia,fgueuu4,t1_fgu9rew,1581119080.0,"I donâ€™t think I gave enough context for the allergy part, sheâ€™s afraid to tell them about medical stuff because of some comments theyâ€™ve made about her allergies, but they have taken her to the doctor for them, gotten her an epipen, etc. so it isnâ€™t that serious. They have a hard time seeing when there is a problem, but itâ€™s not so bad that any of us are at risk. Iâ€™m hoping that sheâ€™ll have a chance to talk to a professional about it so theyâ€™ll have to see whatâ€™s going on."
misophonia,fgtz25z,t1_fgtyrcp,1581111261.0,I was actually thinking about buying those for her upcoming birthday!
misophonia,fgtsuif,t1_fgtqb2m,1581108922.0,Iâ€™m her sister haha but thank you!! We were hoping she would get used to the noises but now that itâ€™s clearly a serious issue and more than just an annoyance Iâ€™m hoping weâ€™ll all do better and be more understanding.
misophonia,fgtsgq9,t1_fgtqz68,1581108708.0,Thank you I will definitely keep those in mind!
misophonia,fgtq83x,t1_fgtmul2,1581107950.0,oh thanks!
misophonia,fgtc332,t1_fgtavcg,1581102387.0,"Luckily the situation with her allergies is better, she does have an epipen, they just make a lot of comments about her exaggerating or making it up. I think they would be convinced if a professional told them whatâ€™s going on thankfully"
misophonia,fgt9ry1,t1_fgt9du2,1581101484.0,"Thank you! If Iâ€™m remembering right, our parents insurance will cover some therapy visits, so hopefully if itâ€™s recommended by a doctor they will be willing to try that"
misophonia,fgt9fnz,t1_fgt8s5c,1581101292.0,"Sheâ€™s 14 and Iâ€™m 18. Yeah, that sounds pretty similar to what sheâ€™s said to me"
misophonia,fgt5k9x,t1_fgt4umt,1581099507.0,"As far as Iâ€™m aware, I am unable to get her any kind of medical care because Iâ€™m not a legal guardian, and also because of insurance. Itâ€™s unlikely our parents will be willing to take her to a professional because of it, but right now her best bet is probably to tell a doctor about it during an unrelated visit"
selfharm,fg3jc96,t3_ewoxwf,1580482916.0,15 years is impressive! unfortunately relapses happen but i hope youâ€™re okay and just know that it doesâ€™t erase all the progress youâ€™ve made
selfharm,fg3i3ja,t3_ewmw61,1580482072.0,"relapsing after such a long clean streak can be rough, but itâ€™s important to remember itâ€™s part of recovery and you are still moving forward. what works to relieve stress for me usually involves something to keep both my hands and mind busy. so usually listening to podcasts/music/documentaries/ect. while cleaning, playing a simple game, crocheting, or just fidgeting. it also doesnâ€™t hurt to find someone safe to talk to about whatâ€™s going on."
selfharm,fg3h8lm,t3_ewkvy2,1580481470.0,How is your foot feeling now? I know its scary but if you could be badly hurt you need to put your health first and get it looked at.
COCSA,fg3gt9j,t1_fg3ghwh,1580481164.0,"iâ€™m not entirely sure how itâ€™s effected me, but i definitely think it has something to do with my aversions to sex and touch. and i can definitely relate to that, its very confusing to not know if you can consider something trauma. iâ€™m sorry to hear youâ€™re struggling with that"
selfharm,fg3emsb,t3_ewopm1,1580479540.0,"honestly, as far as iâ€™ve experienced at least, while the urges become less often and less strong after staying clean for long times, they never truly go away, just get a whole lot easier to ignore"
COCSA,fg3d144,t1_fg330hv,1580478293.0,"thank you! :) iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve found resources that have been helpful for you! iâ€™ve been thinking about seeing a therapist, but for now iâ€™m glad there are places like this where i can talk about it"
COCSA,fg3cqyz,t1_fg3aijl,1580478068.0,"yeah! i know a little of what happened for sure through my mom, a boy in my class would grope me often (as far as i know always through clothes), and on at least one occasion laid on top of me and humped me. (i know it sounds a bit crude but i couldnâ€™t think of a better way to word that) that time was when teachers took notice because he was very loud and outwardly violent 

the only memory i really have is being scared because i knew what was about to happen and iâ€™d realized there was nothing i could do to stop it, and then the feeling of wanting to get his hands off me but feeling like i couldnâ€™t move

so the memories i have are very vague and donâ€™t include any detail of what happened"
