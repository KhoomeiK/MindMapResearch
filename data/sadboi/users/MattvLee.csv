CongratsLikeImFive,foteu8r,t3_g97lxw,1588051884.0,"lmao when i was in grade 3 i memorized it to 100 digits. haha i thought that was a huge accomplishment...time sure flies

A helpful tip is to memorize it in chunks of 4-6 digits., and after u memorized it add another chunk. Something like this:
3.14 159265 3589 79323 84626 433832 7950 2884 1971 693993 7510 5820 97494 4592 3078 1640 628 620 8998 6280 348253 4211 70679

It helps if you look for one or more chunks with an easy to remember sequences (E.g. 693993, 628 620 8998 6280)

Hope this helps!"

unpopularopinion,f2gjpfy,t1_f2elojv,1570231496.0,"I'm from China, and while I have never been myself I have been told by family and friends of the propaganda and other bullshit that the government tells the people. Because of censorship they've come to believe they're living a great life and that this is how the rest of the world is. They honestly don't care; they just think it's a way of life and they have nothing much to complain about.

I also feel like as this is a current event that people will start associating Chinese people with the CCP. A lot of people I celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the PRC, not because they supported the government but for the love of their homeland. Many of them don't distinguish the government from the country itself, which can be easily interpreted by others as supporting the Communists. On top of that, you cannot blame people for being ignorant while living in a country where the government censors basically anything from the outside world. OP is right about the CCP being an inhumane government, which is why thousands of families like my own left; but I feel like hate against CCP will lead to the outright hate of Chinese people in general. 

While what u/FreedomHK27 said about the Chinese government is completely true, I don't think that we should treat ALL people who support the CCP like shit. That being said, I strongly condemn the policies and actions of the CCP and I could make an endless list of the terrible things that they have done.

That's actually why I've never been to China, my parents think I'm gonna say some shit about the government and get killed lmao"
