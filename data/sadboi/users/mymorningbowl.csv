AnimalCrossing,fr0vr13,t1_fr0v136,1589807872.0,"perhaps you’re right, but this is basically the first time in my 33 years of life that I’ve ever played and cared about a video game so I am just enjoying all the little things. thank you for the congrats!"
eatsandwiches,fqzhwyk,t1_fqzgj5n,1589767744.0,wow. yes.
AnimalCrossing,fqtx5zy,t3_gkt1fa,1589647827.0,"ok this is awesome on so so many levels! as a very amateur cake maker myself, this is seriously impressive. and looks delicious honestly! happy birthday!"
bonnaroo,fqmp8oa,t3_gh9jlp,1589481216.0,"this is a great idea you are so thoughtful!! a few ideas: if you don’t already have some, buy some disco lights off amazon or wherever you prefer, you can get fun little ones for like $20 and they really elevate the vibes at night. also hang some christmas lights around the rooms! maybe put little homemade signs around for the stage names like “this tent” is your bedroom, “what stage” is the living room... etc. make a schedule (that you don’t have to stick to lol just for fun) where you style it like the roo daily schedule and do like an hour block for “pizza dinner at The Which” and “cake time on The What” etc. def watch old Roo and other fest sets on youtube with the disco lights going. hmmm you could make a Totem with household items too like some old wrapping paper tubes for the pole and something silly taped to the top? what else, you can wear your camelbacks around for water lol.  if I think of anything more I will comment again!!"
cats,fqiato0,t1_fqhm951,1589393481.0,lol I cannot stop laughing

relationship_advice,fq36xiy,t1_fq2dm4v,1589063574.0,"yes love that. when I started dating my boyfriend I felt weird admitting I slept with a stuffed animal, but instead of laughing at me like I expected he thought it was cute, then last year for my birthday he got me a stuffed pikachu to sleep with which I now snuggle nightly. I am 33."
eatsandwiches,fq1xedl,t3_gggb05,1589050773.0,holy crap I need this sandwich and this view in my life

eatsandwiches,fpqjuww,t1_fpnzdx9,1588824494.0,lol I did not realize how much hate for ketchup there is. I grew up eating cheesesteaks at least once a week in Philly burbs. always put ketchup on mine and loved it. yours looks bomb to me!

bonnaroo,foym1gd,t1_foyf8jk,1588174940.0,"I totally get that but honestly if roo comes back next year, please consider going. yes they care about money, they’re a business. yes they could’ve handled this better I agree and it annoys me too. but trust me when I say while you are at roo you won’t be thinking about that. you’ll be making lifelong friends and memories in your most happy and carefree state."

bonnaroo,fogwwy4,t1_fofp4g7,1587757905.0,"keep your goals. and make new ones too. maybe keep those dates as YOUR big weekend to focus on staying sober for/til, and then make a new goal to stay sober thru a weekend a few months from that. I have faith in you!!!"
bonnaroo,fogv0rr,t1_fogqvo8,1587757282.0,"yeah, I just wish they would make it official and hopefully begin the refund process for those that really could use that money right now. especially with rent coming due soon"
LittleFiresEverywhere,foc34ol,t1_fobkdra,1587666567.0,"wow can Lex not catch a break there lol sheesh. how about she broke free from her mom and saw the light, works hard and tries to become a more loving and inclusive person"
LittleFiresEverywhere,foc24g7,t1_fobrjn6,1587666251.0,"tbh I finished the episode assuming the cops would find her pretty quickly, she has zero resources and it wouldn’t be that hard for cops all over to get her description out there to be found."
LittleFiresEverywhere,foc1g0u,t1_fobf2u4,1587666044.0,it was extreme but there was nothing minor about the arguments that took place right before this happened imo
askwomenadvice,fobvqhd,t1_foa6j93,1587664196.0,wholeheartedly disagree. I left my family and friends to move halfway across the country where I knew nobody and it was absolutely best decision of my life. five years later and I have an amazing friend and family group here now as well as my people back home. Move move move!!

twentyonepilots,fnshhpy,t1_fnsa392,1587221721.0,I bought a nice black eye mask for sleeping when I travel for the same reason. such a game changer
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnrfv3q,t1_fnr7k3d,1587187704.0,morally speaking and legally are two diff things though and this was late 80s or early 90s... not really any laws for it then. I highly doubt she would’ve won in court. all that being said yes it was a very sad situation all around how it all went down I feel ya there for sure! better support system and therapy would’ve been so good for Mia.
eatsandwiches,fnlfbwl,t1_fnlanuu,1587052558.0,agreed. I love melty cheese but certain sandwiches I wayyy prefer the cheese like you have it here.
Fibromyalgia,fnlf5nn,t3_g28kzg,1587052471.0,"so great you have a support system like that! makes me so happy. one of my worse flare ups was right after a concert years ago, with my five closest girl friends and they saved me that night. when they dropped me off at my apartment my one friend had to basically carry me up the two flights of stairs cause my legs just wouldn’t support my body. she put me in bed so I could try to sleep. I love those girls so much."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnlenut,t1_fnk1xve,1587052223.0,"yeah I can see that too when you put it that way. to me it just felt like lazy writing though, no matter how little she cares about Izzy she isn’t stupid and she’s all about perfection and appearances I don’t think she would have ever left those on top like that"
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnlejxh,t1_fnk2uat,1587052168.0,I would argue she 100% stole her.  it was never supposed to be her baby. she signed up to be a surrogate for money. she grew Pearl yes biologically speaking she is her baby but that wasn’t the deal... also this was late 80s when there weren’t really any laws or set precedents for surrogacy like this so yeah
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjxo2x,t1_fn1o8i7,1587009465.0,we had water turned off before growing up. no way in hell did we ever go ask neighbors for help or for water. it’s embarrassing af
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjx5bo,t1_fna9ygb,1587009102.0,"ohh watch Scandal. she is amazing in it and it’s honestly one of the best shows ever, superrrr intense. don’t read any spoilers!"
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjwg33,t3_g1mg1e,1587008618.0,"lol yes. constantly in my family, growing up and still (I’m in my 30s now)"
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjv08w,t1_fniv0n6,1587007631.0,I know you mean well by that but as someone who grew up poor and had to pay for college and work minimum five jobs at once and have rich friends that have said those same words to me before... it makes me feel wayyyy worse and awkward
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjsvab,t1_fnjoqs4,1587006206.0,".... Mia made shit choices too, like literally stealing a baby and lying about it. and lying about having a rainy day fund instead raising her baby in a car. Mia is shitty."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fnjs3qc,t1_fnjhgmr,1587005703.0,I was sad she found them but honestly I laughed when she found them cause how dumb is she to just dump them on top of the trash and not hide them. that was just stupid and not realistic imo.
eatsandwiches,fnhfkn1,t1_fngw84h,1586961459.0,yes I did the mayo on the bread too! but the cayenne... that is inspired. absolutely trying that thanks for the idea!
bonnaroo,fndkyqn,t1_fnddgly,1586872343.0,"oh man I have so many roo show regrets too but I always try to remind myself I did what I did in the moment cause it’s what my soul needed at that time. you should def see if there’s some good videos online of her roo show, or any of her fest sets really!"
hockey,fnc1qz6,t3_g0qc4w,1586826798.0,lol this is so good
bonnaroo,fnbb85z,t1_fnb9bbm,1586812457.0,"yeah it’s practically all I think about. been seeing a lot of people say they think security checks heading into venues in the future will also include temperature checks and potentially something to verify being vaccinated. I forget if that was a comment in this sub or a diff thread but yeah, a lot to consider"
bonnaroo,fnb8ey8,t1_fnahqz0,1586811028.0,I was thinking about this recently. let’s say smaller venues can have shows again but at half capacity. so what does that mean for already ticketed shows? they add more nights at half cap or half the people that bought tickets and it got rescheduled just lose their ticket now? I also am well aware we aren’t even close to getting to the point of being able to figure this out but honestly just spitballing cause what the hell else do I have to do lol
Devs,fmzttzt,t3_fyapf2,1586529411.0,hahaha yes! when he said that I turned to my boyfriend and said “so he’s quarantining too... but fake cause only 24 hours pshhhh”

Fitness,fmf4bko,t3_fupaio,1586019661.0,"I am about to do a resistance band workout at home which is cool, but dammit I miss heavy weights. I had finally gotten up to squatting 175 (I’m female 135lb) and was so proud of myself and all I wanna do right now is lift some heavy weights. blah."
bonnaroo,fmdqloo,t1_fmcsofj,1585974959.0,"from a self proclaimed insurance nerd, thank you for this beautiful explanation"
bonnaroo,flrlh2h,t1_flr4i0d,1585422655.0,I mean they pulled my auto payment already just a couple days ago so idk about that
AskReddit,flj4lbc,t1_flhcefu,1585198734.0,this is excellent but you should consider doing squats a few days a week then deadlifts (using something around the house for weight) and/or bridges plus a rest day or two each week so you more proportionately strengthen your legs and especially your muscles around the joints!
cats,flhdj11,t1_flhcg26,1585160642.0,same lol I get so caught up watching the old ones!! ugh this show is so good
cats,flhb5p3,t1_flfn6v5,1585159415.0,"that’s so funny. it was good, I only watched it once and feel like I need to give it another go... but I will be honest I am reallllly partial to the first like three seasons lol I rewatch those seasons constantly!"

cats,flfm97g,t1_flflhm6,1585110433.0,"Ok [try this link](http://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/11699) it has specific info for VA, including the rules. You would have to file as a Loss of work or reduction of hours (unless you were specifically laid off but doesn’t sound like the case). There is a number to try calling there but I imagine call wait times will be intense. Try the online route first if possible. Be sure to have your info ready including your gross earnings as there’s certain thresholds and rules there. Best of luck and reach out if you’d like further guidance (again disclaimer I am not an expert nor am I trying to give any legal advice here, simply just lending a hand to help!)"
cats,flfld1e,t1_flfgv1b,1585109696.0,"Sorry to hear you have to deal with that, sending you good vibes! I know there’s a way to file online and by phone. I’ve heard both have been tough in terms
of waiting times and all given the sheer volume. It may depend on what state you are in, but [this site](https://www.naswa.org/resources/coronavirus)  has been updated almost daily and has links/info by state. try to do a google search with your states specific laws if that site doesn’t help. I am not an expert but am happy to try and help if I can, what state are you in?? Also remember that Congress is expecting to (eventually) pass some sort of stimulus package which should include changes or updates to unemployment benefits so keep an eye on the news for that as well. all the good vibes to you! feel free to DM if you’d like any further guidance!"
