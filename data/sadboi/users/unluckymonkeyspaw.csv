Let’s be real, some people’s pain is worse than others in a medical sense but it’s complicated as everybody has a different pain tolerances but some people get defensive of their right to be in pain when you’re not and would never invalidate what they feel, you just want to vent. Remind people that you stating your pain doesn’t mean no one else is in pain, just that you are

Incoming rant; 
Way back in 2016 when one of my discs had herniated in my upper back it was pushing on my central nervous system basically (still is) and it was causing me to black out for a few seconds sometimes, I was in so much pain. I was getting on to the bus after work one night and blacked out and fell while stepping on and scraped up the skin on my left leg and arm pretty badly so I decided to take myself to the ER close to my house. When I’m finally seen by a doctor I explain to him my medical history of back issues and my first disc herniation that happened in my lower back when I was 19 and that I’d had a discectomy when I was 21 and I knew what it felt like, this was it. The ER DR told me that I just had a **pulled muscle**. I kept trying to explain how much pain I was in but he had already dismissed me I guess. He eventually said that he would give me a couple painkillers to take home and told me to wait back in the waiting room. After about an hour more of me sitting in a hard plastic waiting room chair he comes out and tells me I can go home now but doesn’t give me any painkillers or a even a script to pick some up

It’s not like I had a history or going to any hospitals, my name wouldn’t come up on any narcotics warning lists, I was dressed nicely because I’d just come from my reception job and my housemates came to wait with me who had also just come from office jobs, I guess women in their early 20’s just don’t get taken seriously"
ArtCrit,fftfdvx,t3_ev5ohu,1580218961.0,"I’d like to do a series based of [this recent sketch](https://imgur.com/a/pF7X5qb) but I’m having trouble with what medium to do it in and both pieces feeling off.

They way your arm works with your strokes is when drawing upwards your forearm muscles are relaxed and you can draw smooth, long lines easier, while moving your arm downwards your muscles are a little tense so it works well with making short straight strokes and small details. It’s something I learned when I was beginning to use ink and a brush and it really helped me [(example from 2012)](https://imgur.com/a/VYnHs0Z). Don’t be afraid to move your paper around constantly to make sure each stroke is comfortable and easy to make
