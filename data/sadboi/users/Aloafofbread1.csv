They were still american Troops but they had to fight with the French. Also I don’t think they had to give up citizenship and I don’t think they were offered French citizenship since that’s what the French foreign legion is for.
FragileWhiteRedditor,fdyknvq,t1_fdye8b6,1578780788.0,Yeah I think battlefield 5 had a segment of their campaign about that which i think is pretty cool because that’s one of the only pieces of ww2 media that I’ve seen that even acknowledges the existence of black French soldiers.

patientgamers,fds78fi,t1_fdry5na,1578695928.0,"I think you’re right when you say that they have the same type of fighting system in theory but I think they’re still different in practice. For example FPS games all have essentially the same type of combat system but not all FPS games are equal in gameplay due to small differences in the overall game design and mechanics that’s why games like Rainbow six siege and counter strike play so differently despite both of them being theoretically very similar. I think the same thing applies to the Witcher and dark souls, they have the same type of combat system but I think dark souls just has a straight up better and deeper version of that combat system and the entire game as a whole lends itself better to combat in terms of level design, mechanics, and enemies while the Witcher has to focus on story, character development, dialogue, lore, etc.

Also I’m not saying that dark souls games are better than the Witcher games, both games are great (and I really have no opinion on which one is better) but both games have their flaws too and I think the Witcher’s flaws are in its combat whereas (like you said) the souls games are lacking in story and lore but I think that’s because they mostly focused on combat and gameplay whereas the Witcher has a much heavier focus on story, lore, and character development which didn’t let them focus on combat as much.

But yeah that’s just like my opinion, man."

patientgamers,fdqhljz,t1_fdq9tmg,1578666867.0,"Yeah I beat the game and IMO it’s wildly overrated, like yeah it’s a great game but people act like it’s the best game ever made and that it has no flaws when in reality it really lacks in some areas like how it’s an open world game that really doesn’t reward or encourage exploring and like you said the combat is pretty fun but gets incredibly repetitive and upgrading weapons and armor really doesn’t feel like it does anything. Honestly the combat really just amounts to:

1.press one of the two attack buttons to deal damage

2.when you see an enemy start to wind up an attack, press one of the two dodge buttons to avoid the attack

3.repeat steps 1 and 2

It also felt like the only real variation between enemies was basically how much damage they do and how much health they have."

So I left her, it was the only choice. One thing I had to realize is that as long as you’re in a relationship with someone with bipolar you’ll never truly be happy because while things *can* get better they will never become good, your whole life will be a constant cycle of waiting for something bad to happen, and then damage control after the bipolar one inevitably fucks something up.
