NoFap,fkup0q9,t1_fkunluq,1584553483.0,"Wikipedia is your best friend as translations of (some) indian texts can get tedious. The most popular indian philosophy in the west is the advaita branch of ideas brought to the west by Swami Vivekananda. It is a little pantheism a little monism. They go about trying to prove the non duality of individual person to the collective with logic alone. The ashtavakra gita pdf is available in english for free online. It is advanced level text (as many claim) but its the most intoxicating :)

Hope you have fun! :)"
NoFap,fkunbta,t1_fkulh5c,1584552599.0,"Well we learn as we go don't we. If we figured life out all in one go wouldn't it start getting boring like grinding in a video game. While it is most frustrating i still believe that life teaches you most when it disrupts your preconceptions and preconceived notions. Idk I've repeatedly made the same mistakes I've vowed to never repeat. But yet every time i fail somehow I've always found the strenth to get back up. I firmly believe I will be able to live in contentment one day, a life of routine which is fulfilling to myself and others devoid of destructive behaviours.

Do you by any chance read indian philosophy? It is less focused on morality and ethics than western philosophy and more on metaphysical aspects of ""creation"". You are left to your own devices to decide the ""good"" and the ""bad"". You can lose yourself for days without needing to reflect on your own person and life choices or world views. Just an exercise in mental gymnastics contemplating the universe and its origins through logical arguments.

Perfect for when you want to take a break from constant nit picking yourself and your psyche for flaws which need to be worked on :)"

NoFap,fkukw6t,t1_fkuge6g,1584551294.0,"The Buddha once said our actions their consequences alone truly belong to us. I think then it is wisest to live in complete Sincerity to our own ideals. 

Me myself i want to be able fit into society and provide as much utility as the day demands. Me being perceived as superior while would definitely be flattering is not my objective since i have been helped out of situations by others with no expectations of recognition or recompense.

I don't want to pretend to know the why to your admiration to being an outcast. I don't. So I'm in no place to judge your stance of wanting to emulate someone who almost seemed like he wanted society to disown him. I believe every piece of the jigsaw is absolutely necessary for the puzzle to be a complete whole. And both of us are part of this puzzle we call life just like the billion others who are just as differently wired from one another.
