college,fjemy2x,t3_fcwo73,1583274640.0,"I would stay at home for the 8k; my brother is at a college that costs way less than mine and I wish I could go back and tell myself that it’s okay to do so! Also, the university I attend now isn’t far from home and it still feels like a world away. You’ll end up finding friends one way or another, just remember quality > quantity."
NoStupidQuestions,fgipzy5,t3_eynwmj,1580828277.0,"Yes, but once you do it more on your own you learn more than you did before your driving test! Congrats on passing by the way!"
Anxiety,fg8gtwu,t3_ex4u7w,1580619067.0,"I never post because I’m still trying to figure out reddit and the posts I would have a comment for already have 1K+ comments, so I just figure that no one would see it anyway, but I definitely second guess myself a lot as well"
SkincareAddiction,f8kn9pz,t3_e0v0bq,1574613064.0,Wow you are literally stunning
AnxietyDepression,f4swbxc,t1_f4skdz6,1571781512.0,"I’m sorry to hear that:( I hope you find someone new that you feel more comfortable opening up to, that’s awful you feel that way and nobody deserves that especially when you’re struggling every day"
AnxietyDepression,f4svnml,t1_f4sl8aq,1571781298.0,"I did start seeing a psychiatrist and was started on Zoloft, 50mg. I had a follow up after a month and was upped to 100mg and have been working on increasing to that since then (appointment was a few days ago). This is also the first time I’ve been on any medication so I think it’s just frustrating so far."

AnxietyDepression,ezpurjr,t3_d1jpkv,1568049019.0,"OH MY GOD YES. I have SO much reading this semester which I’m not use to as a science major and it really stresses me out - I thought this semester would be more manageable til I saw just how many reading assignments I would have. I’m the same way with writing, it takes me forever to write a paper because I can’t concentrate and I’m such a perfectionist."
MakeupAddiction,ez5ssb4,t3_czvn62,1567704449.0,Plz give me ur face
Anxiety,eyzf5cs,t1_eyxuj3e,1567616330.0,"I get worried about that, too, but I just try to remind myself that if this therapist isn’t working, I can go see a different one at any given time. Also, I know this is something that takes a long time to get even a little bit of control over. I think what we’re doing is a lot better than doing nothing."
Anxiety,eyxti8f,t3_czde0o,1567562148.0,"I recently started seeing a therapist as well! It is definitely scary going for the first time, but I PROMISE you’ll feel better after you go. I’m very proud you were able to take this step!! It’s not an easy thing to do, and you overcame the hardest part :)"
Anxiety,eyxskoz,t3_czbnuz,1567561477.0,Wow this is amazing!! I’m so proud you were able to openly tell a room full of people that you were truthfully struggling. Those that laughed have no clue how much sheer bravery that took. One more step in the right direction!
Anxiety,eykp3rx,t3_cx9kkt,1567163112.0,"I always wake up with it...of course some nights I’m anxious, but I’m usually so exhausted that I can sleep. Lately, I haven’t been able to sleep through the night and I wake up extremely nauseated no matter what."
socialanxiety,ey5ip2u,t3_cvdjgy,1566832642.0,"I just went to a class and found out it is discussion based which made my heart POUND the whole time. Then I read ""5 minute presentation"" and couldn't stop thinking about it the rest of class :/"
AnxietyDepression,eoeef21,t1_eodyno7,1558494414.0,Thank you so much!! Will definitely look into these things
