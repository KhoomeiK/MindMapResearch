So sorry to hear about this. Maybe a family member or friend has one that you could maybe borrow? I got sick in early March. Idk what it was but I was miserable for a week. My sister drove all the way to Fort wayne and threw it up to my balcony so I could check my temp. Cleaned it off and threw it back down. I know it's a pain but I hope you find something and more so I hope you get better."

I ran out of milk today and had to go get more. Driving thru the fort at 2pm was ridic. It wasnt business as usual it was worse and it put me in a shit-tastic mood. You're right, I was rude af and I apologize. 
Never heard it put as a scooter ankle chef kiss, I truly enjoyed that and it put me in my place quickly lol
Please dont lick a shopping cart, again I apologize."

fortwayne,fnstgru,t1_fns264r,1587228476.0,That's weird and hell and kinda creepy
fortwayne,fnstfkj,t1_fnsbiuy,1587228458.0,"Haha I loved what you just said. 
I live in a condo building that consists of mostly seniors. Myself I'm 35 but have smoked for way too long so I've been staying home. My balcony outlooks the parking lot and the main doors people use. I have been watching 90% of the residents here coming and going multiple times a day. I swear one couple is doomsday prepping bc they come home several times a day with a shit load of bags, packages, ect. I know these people dont work bc I've lived here so long. They are treating this time as a vacation! Many of the younger residents are having parties with multiple guests over. Real estate agents have been here knocking door to door to hand out business cards. No churches yet. 
None of the people are wearing any sort of masks. They gather in the parking lot on nice days and visit, shake hands. 
It's very frustrating to watch. I dont have washer/dryer hookups bc there are community laundry rooms on each floor, but after watching all of this I find myself scared to go and do my laundry! I'm afraid of the hallways, elevator and basically all my neighbors bc I havent seen one person acting as if anything unusual is going on. 
I understand you cant force people to believe that this is real and I do understand folks will have to leave at some point to get perishables...but just because those people don't want to take this seriously how is that fair to me when I'm trying to stay as safe as possible? 
I mean I'm kinda living in a big ass nursing home if you think about it. All it's going to take is one person that lives here to get infected and spread it around the building just bc they dont feel like wearing a mask. 
I'm going to move as soon as this ends, if it ever does end. It's been so so damn frustrating watching people care only for themselves from my window. The few times I have had to sneak out to get milk, fort wayne looks like friggin black friday. When the governor says that indiana is complying with the stay at home order, is he even looking at fort wayne? Bc I've seen nothing change.
So I feel your pain. I'm sorry that you're in a similar situation. People wont be changing their ways until they or someone close to them gets infected and gets very sick sadly."

fortwayne,fmikhfu,t3_fv2u1w,1586111380.0,"You're right! Yesterday I had to drive to Rome City to pick up and sanitizer. My nephew works at the dollar general in Wolkotville and left some on his porch for me, sweet huh? Anyways I took Lima out of the Fort and I've never seen so many cars at Home Depot, Lowe's, panda express, basically all of Lima looked like Black Friday. 

I've seen videos on TikTok, Facebook and the news showing empty streets in cities like Detroit and Chicago but here in the Fort we are acting as if nothing is wrong! In my opinion it's a HUGE fuck you to all the healthcare industry who is working 24/7 risking their lives to save us. 

I'm ashamed and embarrassed at the way our citizens are behaving thru this pandemic. It's really shown people's true colors. Yall stay safe out there PLEASE!"

I heard it come from my fellow realtors mouths,  I've seen more than one of these pop up on facebook too. Who knows if its true. Facts are within a matter of days all our schools and public events are shut down. Today they closed down bars and restaurants. Our grocery store had no meat, eggs or paper products and even after the government asking us all to do our part and stay home, an alarming amount of people claim this is all a hoax and are out and about. It sucks right now and it has only just begun."
