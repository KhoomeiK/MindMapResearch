ADHD,f03qj76,t3_d3lqz8,1568366045.0,"I recently came across RSD in a podcast, and after relating so strongly to it, I looked it up.  I also relate 100% to it, and even though it is a newly recognize cluster of symptoms (and not yet an actually diagnosis in the DSM), it seems to obviously be some sort of thing that deserves attention.  It also makes sense as a close relation to emotional deregulation.  I have an ADHD assessment soon, and will bring this up with my physician.  I am curious to hear how things progress."
BPD,eyzom7w,t1_eyzj718,1567622184.0,Same here.
BPD,eyv8f4v,t1_eytijcj,1567484010.0,"I had the same problems in the past (also pre-smart phones) and just assumed it was a me thing.  
It's nice to hear that other people have experience with it and even nicer that there are people that offer such validating and heartwarming responses!"
BPD,exdr5fo,t3_cqcphr,1566184278.0,"I use CBD drops.  I don't know if it's the drops or coincidence of healing time, but after a month I see a HUGE change in how I handle my symptoms.  The emotions and thoughts still occur, but they pass within minutes.  For anxiety, it keeps my thoughts from spinning out of control.  Worth the money"
BPD,ewsa6oe,t3_cpxhyy,1565723264.0,Are you tapering off or did you just full on stop? I highly suggest contacting your doctor.  I quit Zoloft cold turkey and had brain zaps for a couple months. Tapering off any of these meds is key.  I hope you feel better.
lgbt,evzlg83,t1_evzl4lb,1564960683.0,"Good for you!  I am also from a little rural town, so I know how that can be."
EarthPorn,evzl464,t3_cm2wp9,1564960432.0,Beautiful!
lgbt,evzkygs,t3_cm2zvw,1564960310.0,That's so horrible!  Maybe living further away from them will eventually give you the courage (and space) to be out.  Good luck to you!
BPD,evyh0gn,t1_evxasi7,1564932394.0,I appreciate that outlook!  Thanks.
BPD,evygw7n,t1_evy14ch,1564932308.0,"Oh, I know everyone does.  It's more about what those off days look like.  Though I know everyone is different."
BPD,evw8mqc,t3_clih1q,1564857879.0,"Definitely having a sense of purpose, like going back to school and help others has helped me.  Also, I've been taking CBD for my anxiety and that has actually helped chill a lot of my emotions out, including feelings of emptiness."
BPD,evcrmql,t3_cj5rsq,1564421749.0,"It used to be a really bad thing for me.  Especially if I didn't get invited to something ""everyone else"" seemed to.  
What has helped me the most is noticing it when it happens, how my body is feeling, saying out loud that I am envious and relaxing my body.  I am able to let it go pretty quickly now, instead of practically drowning in it."
BPD,eva0wqa,t3_cirkx7,1564336073.0,"I definitely head to the shower or a bath if I am spiraling.  Also, I had a verbally/emotionally abusive ex who would only leave me alone if I locked myself in the bathroom.  It was my only safe space."
BPD,eulydn3,t3_cgh0m4,1563909069.0,"I personally sought out a therapist who specializes in DBT.  She personally doesn't believe in labeling people (BPD diagnosis is super stigmatized and a diagnosis will follow you forever), but was happy to treat my symptoms as such.  I feel like whether your therapist agrees or not, she should discuss the symptoms that bother you and work on them with you.

In school they talk about BPD being something people aren't self aware of.  That the people with it don't think what they feel is wrong.  Which I think is bogus because I always knew something was wrong, even when I couldn't pin point what it was (I sure can now, thanks to my therapist believing my experience)."
BPD,eqqn932,t3_byx2n1,1560225655.0,DAE have intrusive thoughts based around shame and fear of abandonment?  And that escalate to full on panic no matter how much you check the facts and/or cope ahead?
BPD,epnhjkh,t1_epljn18,1559327552.0,"Thank you,  I hope I can keep it up.  I hope you get there, too!"
BPD,eoafsb9,t3_bmezei,1558416269.0,"I tried SAM-E about 8 years ago.  I wasn't yet diagnosed with BPD and just knew that something (anxiety? depression?) was wrong.  It honestly made me feel 10x worse, with any emotional regulation going out the window."
BPD,eoa3scx,t3_bql9qn,1558406612.0,"My therapist shares a lot, sometimes to the point where I feel like I'm not getting enough of my stuff in with our limited time.  I have wondered if it was some kind of test to get me to stand up for myself.  And then other times I worry if I do speak up, I am just overreacting and being insensitive, like she is just trying to be a human being with me.
But if I was getting texts about changing appointments and that other weird shit, I would definitely speak up.  Her reaction to your speaking up is incredibly invalidating and it sounds like it is doing more damage than any therapy she could do for you."
BPD,eoa02z9,t3_br1xnu,1558404339.0,"I feel the same.  If I isolate myself, it is easier to keep my symptoms under control.  But I get lonely and want to be close to people.  I'm in a good relationship right now, but I can see my symptoms spike due to the emotional risk."
