bipolar,fn5iaqc,t3_fzozvh,1586665615.0,"idk, struggling myself tonight. very hard to maintain close relationships sometimes. i feel bubbly and confident some days, depressed and antisocial others. it's not fun feeling defective but you're not, promise. sometimes you gotta weather that storm and see where that next wave takes you. gotta find an outlet for expression. talking to someone (even a stranger) can help. hobbies and interests (this is particularly difficult if you're depressed) are essential. but i want you to know that i sincerely love you. we'll get through this together :)"

cassetteculture,fknit07,t3_fj4312,1584366791.0,this is very cool! i've thought about starting a local label for cassette tape distribution. i'm curious what the operation is like? is it pretty cost effective selling cassette tapes? is it profitable or more a labor of love? love cassettes! nice artwork too lol

LetsTalkMusic,fki7lqj,t1_fkhm2a1,1584213535.0,writing sad songs brings catharsis. it always bugs me when someone critiques a song for being depressing. it's always a short sighted criticism. the point of art like that for me is to provide an outlet to express things that (obviously) are still stigmatized. it feels better to channel any of those negative feelings into a creative outlet than to ruminate in it.

musicians,fimcauh,t3_f8k6n6,1582524796.0,"i started drums lessons when i was eleven. i didn't make drums in the school band so i picked clarinet. the band director's policy was you played clarinet for a year and the best are selected for sax. i was the last person selected. in highschool our band room was littered with out of tune pianos and i really enjoyed how intuitive the key layout is on piano. i had a basic music theory class. we learned the basic components of reading music (which i had already understood) and learning the major, minor,and harmonic minor. i picked up the guitar last year and it's been a blast learning it. 
my advice would be to learn major and minor scales as well as the basic chord patterns and the circle of fifths (you should be able to find a visual aid for the circle of fifths, it's pretty straightforward
when you want to learn a song, start with the chords.
i recommend picking up different instruments. playing drums initially has really informed my piano and guitar playing. and the biggest thing is to have fun maming music.
don't go into it expecting to write your bullet.
instead go in with a blank slate and loosen up. jamming with other people is a good way to bounce around ideas. but you can also use a drum pattern on a keyboard or on garageband. the iRig opened up more avenues as far as composing for me.
sorry for the book! but i've been in your shoes :)

cheers"
