samharris,fizo7uy,t1_fizn7g9,1582868559.0,You are ridiculous. My personal experiences from my family living in that country are anecdotes because it doesn't fit in with Bernie's comments? Again explain to me how healthcare is better there? They spend less on medicine bc there is no medicine. There are no antibiotics. They reuse gloves in hospitals. So they have more doctors. Awesome. We should have that here too. I'm not disputing that. But why not point to better healthcare anywhere else? Why Cuba? Don't you see how this plays right into Trumps scare tactic that a liberal will turn the US into a communist country?

samharris,fizmk10,t1_fizm95q,1582867059.0,"My aunt died from a broken leg there. My grandmother waited 4 days before a doctor saw her after a stroke. Not great healthcare. I lived that. I am liberal, I am for universal healthcare. Not sure why Bernie is bringing this up at all bc they do not have good healthcare. Castro was a dictator and Cuba is not even socialist. Like what is even the point of doubling down on this? I would more like to hear about his insurance plan. How much it will cost and how we can make it happen. I don't want to hear about how great Cubas literacy program is when half of Havana has no power and hospitals have no supplies or medicine. Who is he trying to win over with these comments?"

exjw,fizkx0g,t3_fajmzq,1582865684.0,"I am sorry to say but we share a lot of similarities. I was DF at 18. Except I am now in my 30s. Everything that you are going through is normal for the situation you grew up in. If you can, the best thing for you is to see a counselor or therapist. I have been working with a psychiatrist and she did tell me I had PTSD for various things but amongst my symptoms were the panic attacks and nightmares about Armageddon. I am no doctor but it sounds similar. Just know that you are not crazy and things will get better. I live a happy life now, married with my own children. As difficult as this feels, you will get through this. Sending you lots of love. 
Talk to a professional! I wish I had done it 20 years ago."
