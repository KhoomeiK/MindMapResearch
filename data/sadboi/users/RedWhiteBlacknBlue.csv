depression,fr40gmz,t1_fr3wknm,1589871690.0,"Thanks for the care but still respecting privacy and whatever. But I posted here so I'll talk, but it's a lot to say.



I kinda had a shitty childhood, grew up poor and parents always drunk and fighting. School was my only escape and I did really really well. Was always #1 in my class, took advanced classes etc. And thing was I genuinely *enjoyed* it. I loved learning and doing well in school and feeling such a purpose. 


Early school was my prime. I was smart, athletic and really in shape, had lots of friends, did music and theatre, dressed well, was really charismatic whatever. I had a lot of anxiety then though because I took on so much work and that's where some of my problems started. Anxiety turned into depression because I never thought I could be good enough. I started seeing therapists and taking meds at 15. Has never helped. 


Senior year came and I fell off. I gained a lot of weight, didn't work out anymore, dressed like shit, my grades tanked and I didn't even go to school half the time practically, and just couldn't give a shit anymore. All I felt was depression. I started self harming and drinking to deal with problems both as early as 14 and that carried through high school.



Almost didn't get into college at all because of how my grades fell. When I did I went to a state school that's good but far from my aspirations. Doesn't matter but when I got to college it got even worse. I fully isolated myself, didn't go to class, didn't do my work, didn't say a word to anyone, didn't go to work (which got me fired), didn't even get out of bed sometimes for days at a time. I just fucking couldn't. Eventually decided I'd finally be done with it and kill myself, and had a full plan to hang myself. I dropped out of college instead and went to the hospital. Didn't help. Moved back home with my parents



Whole time i dropped out of school I thought I'd go back as soon as possible but that just isn't possible. Now I just have almost $20,000 in student loan and medical debt, absolutely abysmal credit that won't be fixed for probably a decade, absolutely no real
 achievements whatsoever, failed college and can't go back possibly ever, have no friends at all now, I'm obese, nobody talks to or cares about me. I literally live in my parents' basement at almost 22 and work a dead end meaningless customer service job and that's the ENTIRETY of my life. Work, come home, eat, smoke weed and drink, sleep then do it all again. For years now and that's the full foreseeable future of my life.




Most of all no treatment has ever helped. I've seen 6 therapists over the course of 5 or so years, never worked well with any of them, and I've seen 4 psychiatrists and tried probably a dozen meds by now. Been hospitalized, tried groups, meditation, exercise, eating right, anything probably they tell you to fix depression has not worked at all. I've lost hope that anything ever will work.



And nobody cares at all."

About school I don't know if I'll be able to go back and if i can it'll be a really long time. It's already been a while -- I didn't just drop out, it's been about 2 years now. I dropped out my freshman year spring of 2018. Now the problem is I have a ton of student loan debt and completely ruined credit. The grandparents who co-signed the private student loan I needed have effectively disowned me since I dropped out and they won't sign again, so I have nobody to do it now. I can't get loans myself either because my credit is so bad, and it likely will be for *minimum* 5 more years, way more likely a lot longer.




So I'm sitting on about $20,000 in debt, a credit score hovering around 500-550, no family that can really help me out and no end in sight. It'll probably be a decade at this rate before I have that paid off and my credit fixed, or even until one or the other of those things happen



The possibly even longer-term problem is the grades I got while I was in college. I was so depressed and anxious I just couldn't even leave my dorm room for days at a time. Didn't go to class, didn't do my work etc. so I literally had all Fs. Now anytime from now until eternity if I apply for a college they'll see that transcript and reject me."

I went to college but depression and anxiety got the best of me. I eventually was failing all my classes and dropped out. I haven't really done anything since, just work shitty jobs and try to pass the time. Seems like that's all my life will be forever now.

The student loans are for no credit and the medical bills are from a patch hospital stay that clearly didn't help if I'm feeling the same way now. Not only is all my money going towards debt but the debt isn't even for anything. I could just throw cash into a bonfire for the same effect.


My life is just condemned to that. I have no luxury to do things I want to or save up money or anything. Just stuck. It's like my life is on hold and maybe someday I'll live again, but also maybe not and it'll be a very long time if I ever can.

Next I had to get a private student loan to cover the gap that federal aid didn't cover, and I had to have family cosign the loan but since I dropped out they said they'd never do that again. I could never get a loan on my own but I have nobody to sign for it. So I'd have to wait until my credit is fixed enough to get loans in my own name which will probably take close to a decade with my credit history now. This was even from a state school that could've been cheaper but still really isn't much at all as far as decent universities go. 


So yeah my grades were too bad and I also have no way to pay for it. Plus depression was the reason I failed but that isn't going away anytime, so I don't think I'd academically cut it a second time either."

Even if maybe by the time I'm in my 30s I'm out of debt and my credit is fixed that isn't worth the wait when life is like this. It isn't enough to get me through just thinking oh maybe in a decade I can be happy, but for now life is horrible and there's nothing you can do about it.
