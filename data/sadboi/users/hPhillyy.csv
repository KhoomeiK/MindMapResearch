Sometime so feel like I just never woke up, other times I'm convinced reality is actually a personalised hellscape and everyone is demons that were created specifically to torture me, sometimes it's just like I'm controlling a meat puppet and I'm just a step back from being a real person, kind of like swapping to third person perspective in a video game, like my eyes are right behind my head watching everything happen.
It still happens a lot, but sometimes I can ""snap out of it"" for just long enough to call my counsellor and tell him what happening.
It's freaky when you don't know what's happening, I hope you have a counsellor or someone who is safe that you can talk to without judgement!"
