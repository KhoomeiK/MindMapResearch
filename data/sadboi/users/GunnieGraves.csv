He states the officer was unfairly hiding and waiting in a spot where the speed increases naturally because it‚Äôs a downhill, but the car has a governor so it couldn‚Äôt have picked up speed. Judge points out the laser clocked him at 25 over the speed limit nonetheless. 

He shifts tactics and says ‚Äúwell when was the last time the laser was calibrated‚Äù. Officer advises they calibrate before every shift. Kid then very very snarkily asks ‚Äúwell how do you know you calibrated it correctly?‚Äù

Cop responds by reciting the entire calibration procedure and then advising that he is the State Police trainer for all speed interdiction devices including laser and radar and has been in that role for 25 years. 

Kid got real quiet after that and did not get his ticket dismissed. Might have gotten a reduction out of pity, but it was very much a ‚Äúdo you know who I am?‚Äù moment."

The restaurant closed in the last 2 years or so. However that‚Äôs more indicative of the business rather than the TV show. There‚Äôs a better diner like 1/4 mile away from the location that‚Äôs way better. Lines out the door every weekend (well, not lately).
