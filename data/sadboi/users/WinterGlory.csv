mentalhealth,fqz4qcm,t3_glo8yd,1589759881.0,"As a teen I hated school. Being forced to learn stuff I couldn't care less about. It made me sick. I wanted to go into adult schooling because I could go to my own pace rather than have 6 godamn classes cramed into a single day. My parents didn't allowed it and I struggle all the way through. Then college. And it was world changing. I took only 4 classes per session. And it was a dream compared to high school. Althought I couldn't go my own pace, I had way less classes, thus less homeworks to do for a single day and I had the best grades I ever had even if I procrastinated a lot. It's so much simpler when you dont have 6 different classes a day and 1 homework per class. Now I have 1 class per evening (I do night class) so one homework per day and it's a breeze. Though I do struggle with distance class because its hard to motivate myself to spent hours on a documentary analysis when I am alone in my home but that is an exceptional situation. 

I dont really have any advice for you aside to try stay strong for a little while, consider your options, adult schooling is much easier if you struggle juggling with too many classes at once. Also noteworthy : highschools will say that college and university is so crazy hard and you must be prepared NOW or you will fail and they talk as if its the most challenging thing ever. And as much as it can be true if you try to speed run things, if you take your time, and adapt your schedule to your needs, then no, its really not that hard. I hated and still hate school, but I went from grades ranging around 65-80 in highschool to 80-100 in college. All because I took my time. With less classes I can focus on each one of them."

You can kill your current life without dying. You can kill this version of you and start a new one.

Its almost fate that I saw this post. I saw it only few minutes before I saw yiur post, and my first thought upon seeing,this was ""I will save this and use it to help people on r/mentalhealth"" I scroll down a little and see your post. I know its not,much comfort if you are at a point where you are thinking about killing yourself, but I wanted to shre it anyway because it speaks volume. 

I was once in your shoes. And no amount of advice helped me. I couldn't care less about the people I was going to leave behind. But still, my attempt failed and I survived without anyone ever knowing what I tried to do. I could have tried again but didn't, I was so low I didn't even had the motivation to end it all anymore. But by not having the motivation to do it, I started thinking of other things. General things, small ""unimportant"" things, like a good breeze in summer, wind in my hair, a day quieter that usual. I started appreciating those things. I sought them. And by seeking them, I was opening the door just enough for more things to affect me, both positively and negatively. It was scary. At one point I noticed that bad things started to affect me again and I almost returned to my miserable state. But I got a taste of happiness. I couldn't go back down without a fight. It took me everything to stay at a very minimal state of content. I was still very much in depression, but I was a but better. And that was enough for me. Slowly, by seeking small things, I found other bigger things, like a very good friend who is still my best friend 6 years latter. I am a very dependent person in my relationships and I have a severe fear of abandonment. But my mentality back then was, I dont want to get too attached to someone who eould leave me latter on when I tell them,about my broken mind. So I told her straight away, as soon as I started to feel too comfortable with her. She couldnt care less. In fact she was very supportive. She was my rock in my most difficult times and I was hers. Over the years I got better. And even if it was a major setback and at my age I coyld be a lot more advance than I am right now, I still love my life. It took me time, but it was worth not dying. If you would have told me,back when I wanted to die, that only a few,months latter I woukd have the best friend I coukd ever dream off, that would make me happy and open, the doors for me to find my wings and eventually find love and be happy, I woukd have been mad at you. I woukd have assumed you were mocking me and accused you of being ""like everyone else"" giving me stupid selfish advice. ""As if you can even understand... Don't say ridiculous lies like that"". But it truly happen. And I firmly believe that something similar could happen to you. You just have to,find something first. One small things that could make you happy, even momentarily. Then seek it. Enjoy it while it last, then seek it again somewhere else. I couldn't motivate myself to take a shower, but when I saw the trees bending and swaying, I would open my door and just stand rhere, taking it all in. In a way, wind saved me from death. Just wind, that is all it took to make me wanf to live until the next time."

Exploding head syndrome... Thanks, now I know why I hear ""car accidents"" right before falling asleep sometimes. But do you hear loud noises when you wake up? Because that could be it.

On the neurological aspect, if your brain can't understand how falling asleep works and has been giving you hypnagogic jerk for a while, it is possible that it simply doesnt work on you anymore because it does it too often. So your brain could have figured another way of waking you up by giving you nightmares. If this is your case, the question is : is your brain unable to understand you are falling asleep because of a defect or because of a bad sleep schedule/routine or because of something psychological. The only way to know would be to get tested."

mentalhealth,fqm74to,t3_gjj6yd,1589472638.0,"It does sound like anxiety but to make sure, get tested for sleep apnea or neurological sleep perturbances. Sleep apnea, because when the brain starves of oxygen because you don't breathe well when asleep and as the brain panics and figures out ways to keep you alive it could be the cause nightmares. And neurological problems because : Sometimes when we are trying to fall asleep the brain will notice the drop in heart rate and breathing, but somehow doesn't understand it's because you are sleeping. So in a panic it thinks you are dying and jerks you up. It can sometimes give a sensation of falling. Most of the time people dream they tripped and fell right before waking up, but it cwould result in more terrifying nightmares, especially if this happens to you often. If your brain struggles to understand sleep patterns, that could be neurological.

Basically she was the daughter of an Nmom. She went into therapy because she thought her mom didn’t love her (she was in her thirties). But she did not wanted to believe that. She talked about writing a letter to her mom. My teacher asked « what if she reads it and doesn’t care? What will you do? ». Patient thought about it but was still pretty much in denial and was convinced her mom would read it. The next week she proudly said she sent the letter to her mom and is waiting for an answer. Few weeks pass and she hasn’t gotten any answer. She told my teacher she was going to ask her mom about it. Teacher asked « what will you do if she says she didn’t read it or don’t care? ». Patient still in denial assumed her mom simply didn’t have the words to write her back. The next week she came in visibly sad. Saying « my mom really doesn’t love me, she threw away the letter and told me she didn’t care ». And then and only then could my teacher finally start helping her heal. 

Even therapists cannot heal those who are in denial. You need to accept things as they are before you can move on. Forgiving isn’t the same as forgetting. Forgiving doesn’t mean to become best friends again with someone who backstabbed you. In cases like yours it’s more about letting go of the hate and bad feelings. 

Hatred is really toxic. It slowly poisons you from the inside. What people don’t realize is that « hatred poisoning » is 99.9% your fault. Someone did something awful to you, but you chose to keep the hatred alive. Hatred hurts. It hurts in a different way that the actual betrayal hurt. That pain coming from hatred, people tend to blame the person who betrayed them « it’s their fault I hate them, thus it’s their fault I am in pain ». Even if in actuality, they don’t have any pain from the backstabbing anymore. The only pain left is hatred. And they blame it on the other. When people say forgiving is healing, it’s about forgiving yourself for all the pain YOU caused yourself because of hate and moving on from the betrayal in whatever way you want."

By being neglected so much, she will have a hard time forging lasting relationships as she will not trust people to help her in times of need (according to Freudian psychoanalysis). Being neglected now is making her not trusting others to help her. Yeah she won’t be a fussy child, but she also won’t confide in you or in anyone when in trouble and will rather endure her problems alone no matter how severe the problem may be. If she is anything like the people I’ve seen who were neglected, you wouldn’t even know her wrist where broken unless you checked for swelling, because she won’t bother to tell you she is in pain. That is a worst case scenario, I’m not saying she is guaranteed to end up like this, but she certainly could. Neglect at a young age molds a child for life.

raisedbynarcissists,fpkex9d,t3_gdbla7,1588693440.0,"I’m 22 years old, went NC/LC with my Nmom at 15. The hardest part of my grieving was the identity part. I got over my mom relatively fast, because I already knew that she wasn’t going to change, that she was never going to be a calm and sweet mom. She was always going to be this manipulative, verbally abusive person. So it took me a month or so to grieve her disappearance from my life and then I was over it. She tried contacting me, I spent a long time not answering, at one point she got mad and insulted me because I wasn’t answering (it hurt but again she was mad because I won and she lost). A month later she contacted me again like nothing happened. After a year I decide to break NC (my decision) to go LC. I saw her but never in her home, never at mine, always in public so she wouldn’t feel comfortable screaming at me. We would talk over tea, never something serious. More like long lost friends than mother and daughter. I gave up on having a mom. And I think me not acting like a daughter makes her less angry and mad and violent. I was just lucky... I don’t think this is something people should aim for because it’s not realistic. Not all Nmoms will react like my mom. 

The identity part, as I said earlier, was the hardest. Before moving to my dad permanently and going NC with my mom... being an abused victim WAS my identity. I didn’t know enough about myself. I had too low of a self esteem to take compliments. I didn’t know who I was other that a victim of abuse. I used to take the abuse with pride. Talking about it with no filter because I thought it gave me character. As if I was this survivor, a warrior proudly showing off their scars... I never noticed that all I got in return was pity. I couldn’t trust my friends, they didn’t like me, they just pity me... (that’s my anxiety talking).  I had to learn that I was more than a victim. Since I can’t take compliments from others I couldn’t base myself on what my friends said. So I started easy, with my hobbies. So when I was 16-17 I was a quiet, reserved introvert gamer and bookworm girl with a lot of mental issues due to past abuse. This is who I was in my own eyes. And over the years I added a few things to the list (including mental illnesses but hey that’s part of the package, I am not ashamed). The victim part is still there, it will always be there, but it doesn’t have to be the bone of my whole identity. I can’t pinpoint what is the bone yet to be honest, but it’s not my mental health and it’s not the abuse. That is the goal you should aim for. It’s not by denying what happen that you will succeed. Accept it, build yourself one step at the time. What do you do that makes you proud of yourself? What behaviour do you do naturally that you think makes you a good human being? Is that piece of you something you want to add to you identity?"

You sound like a spoiled brat who has been told « no » for the first time. Unfortunately you have no say in your parents decision. They could have tell you in advance but your opinion about getting another family member doesn’t really matter. I know their decision is also impacting you, but they are not the selfish ones for adopting a kid. You are selfish for pitying yourself and calling yourself an abuse victim who’s life is completely ruined. I get that your life changed drastically, but it’s not your sisters fault she was born to bad parents and needed another family. I was around your age when my stepmom got pregnant. Being a single kid I was also worried about how my life was going to change and I was a tad jealous. But I matured and dealt with it rather than blaming my step brother of ruining my life. Yeah I wasn’t the only kid, I wasn’t the priority anymore, so what. That is how life is one general. In adulthood you are no one’s priority. Better get that through your head sooner rather than later. You were really cruel to your sister and lied to avoid taking responsibility for what you did. You missy, are a remorseless bully. And that makes you one hell of and asshole. YTA and a disgusting one at that. 

One way you could try to deal with things from now on would be to talk to your parents. Just tell them that you don’t want to be forced to do stuff with your sis. That you are two separate people and as an individual you want to do your own things without being forced to bring your sister along all the time. That it’s not against her, you are just a teen wanting some independence, not to be a baby sitter. Being sisters doesn’t instantly makes you bff’s and your parents shouldn’t force it.

Try eating three small meals a day with the help of reminders on your phone. Even if you don’t feel hungry when it rings eat something. If really you still feel full and unable to swallow any bite, don’t push it, skip that meal but make sure you eat for the next. Never skip two meals in a row. And don’t plan on skipping meals. If you realize you are skipping every lunch for a week then it’s not because you are full but because you unconsciously don’t want to. If this happens force yourself to eat something small, a cookie or and apple. Just to break the cycle of skipping every lunch. Also record every meal you eat in a diary. I know it takes time and it’s boring but doing so will help you realize just how little you are actually eating and you will see progress over time. If you feel hungry before your alarm, eat. Don’t wait for the alarm. Hunger is good.

In the end, your actions makes you feel like even more of a failure. Making a endless cycle. You have to stop acting all miserable if you want to get better. Instead, why don’t you try to prove to yourself that you are not a failure? ». That is the best translation of the discussion we had, I know it was blunt and maybe a bit harsh but that is the only way I know to get things through his stubbornness. I could see in his eyes that the message did get through, we’ll see in the next couple of days if his behaviour changes. I have been through a lot of crap, I never thought I’d be the one telling someone to change their mindset. But I guess when you see someone else trapped in a loop only then do you realize there was a bit of truth in those words that seemed insensitive. 

This is what people usually mean when they are telling you to change mindset. It’s not about faking to be happy all the time, but trying to not just see the negative. « I hate my job, it’s currently 10AM,  tomorrow I have to work at 8AM, boohoo lets be sad for the next 22h until work ». If you are not yet at work, why constantly think about it? Why not try to have the best day you can have today and complain about work only the next day? This is what it means to not focus on the bad. It doesn’t mean to not acknowledge your feelings, just don’t focus on them when it’s unnecessary and won’t change anything about the situation. Crying and complaining about work will not increase the likelihood that your boss will call and give you a day off, so why spend an entire day doing it if you could do things you actually enjoy in the meantime?"

She gave you one condition and you failed it and then had the galls to criticize your daughter for commenting on your total lack of respect?! Your wife, her mother, is going to die and you can’t even have the decency to wait before pulling out your dick? Yeah she gave you her blessing, that doesn’t mean you have to do it. It is so disrespectful to the person you have spent a big part of your life with to just build another life in her face, to move on before she is even gone, it is disrespectful to your daughter, it is disrespectful to your girlfriend. You sir, are one of the worse kind of asshole. Rotten and selfish, self centered and testosterone shrunken brain « me want boom boom, wife too sick for boom boom ». You have gone out in public on a date and in the process, harmed your daughter reputation (being the daughter of a cheater), you have greatly harmed your wife’s dignity by being selfish and most of all you have harmed your family and the relationship you have with your daughter. Even if she was « older » she would still see the same thing : a selfish egoist man, who prioritize himself over his family. There is nothing more there. You are avoiding the fact that your wife is going to die by seeing someone else. You know the saying « a captain always goes down with his ship »? Well you have fled the ship and let your crew drown with it for your own selfish desires."
AmItheAsshole,fodvc3v,t3_g6uear,1587690817.0,"Apologizing for making a spouse mad even if they were in the wrong? Does he always bring his anger out on you? Is it always your fault he’s mad and irrational? Does he always twists things so that you are the one to blame (I had a long day at work and you do x?! Is that how you thank me?!)?Because those are the top three sign of domestic abuse. This is toxic and not normal, this is not how relationships are meant to be. I get that he is not always like that but how often does it happen? Because once a month is too much already. It’s not a personality querk you have to put up with if it happens too often, at that point it would be an serious issue. He may be the sweetest guy any other time but putting all the blame on you, refusing to apologize, treating you like crap in his fling of anger, is not normal. If he is adamant that his behaviour is not wrong and refuse to seek help or postpone getting help all the time, I am sorry but love-of-your-life or not, he is a bad person and you should go away as soon as possible. If this is a frequent thing (which sounds like it judging by your behaviour of constant apologizing and buttering him up), you are being a victim of abuse. It may be milder that other, but it is still abuse. And in that scenario I recommend you leave now before it gets more serious and the abuse escalate. 

If this is a one time deal, just try and get him to explain himself, it’s not normal, birthday or not, to throw tantrums because mimosas and Champaign. He needs to admit it was wrong and you need to put your foot down and be adamant that you refuse to be treated that way.

In the end, I know how hard it is to give up on a relationship that had made us so happy in the past, but the past is we’re it is, in the past. It is a scary step to make to break a relationship you still care about, but think for your own future. Whatever situation you are in right now is not going to change after a day in a white dress. This is going to be your whole life. Are you sure the temporary heartache of a breakup is worse than the prospect of that life?"

I think it is okay to have fetishes and fantasize about some type of body shape. Pushing someone else to be more like the fantasy is wrong obviously and it’s always important to respect you partner, but having fantasies is not disrespectful on its own. Your boyfriend is in the wrong for not listening to your opinion and not even trying to reassure you and brushing away your insecurities. His fetish is taking a lot of space in your life and it is reasonable that you want to impose limits. 

My boyfriend has a kink and he asked me if we could go together and buy clothes that we will modify so that I could sometime wear it in the bedroom. He never insisted on it and made sure I wasn’t insecure about it. I was feeling a bit weird about it at first and he told me to forget about it if it was making me feel bad, but I wanted to try before saying a definitive no. In the end I enjoyed it too. But in the entire process my boyfriend went out of his way to make sure that I wasn’t having bad feeling. He reassured me that he loves me and my body the way it is and he doesn’t want me to doubt it ever. He just want to try something new and special for occasions. This is what your boyfriend should be doing. He shouldn’t impose his kink on you and he should respect your wishes and never make you feel uncomfortable."

I’m a really anxious person and sometimes my thoughts goes to far and I lose control, but I find that after crying I have better control over them. More often than not when I feel like I have been down for a while or that I’ve been bottling lots of bad feeling I seek to make myself cry on purpose. Watching sad tv shows or playing sad games. I often feel better afterward. 

I am also hypersensitive, both with my senses and emotionally (I’m sympathetic and empathetic, making life an emotional mess). I cried a lot as a kid and people at school made fun of me for that and the more they laughed about me crying the more I cried making an endless loop of misery. But on the day I was told I was hypersensitive (official diagnosis) and it was explained to me, I started to take pride in it. I could feel the pain of others and I decided that my goal in life was to alleviate that pain. I’ve been studying to become a psychologist. I have no shame to say I cry, a lot. I feel strong even if I cry. Because I don’t see crying as a weakness. I see it as being honest with my needs, I see it as a way to heal. Bottling everything up and waiting for it to explode and hurts others is not strength, it’s denial, and it’s toxic for yourself. I won’t ever do that again. Yes, I cry, and I am proud of it."

It was around Christmas. I have 3 families and that year all three were celebrating on a different day. My boyfriend wasn’t going to attend them all. On that day, the 24th, I was suppose to go celebrate with my dad’s side of the family. There was probably a 25 minutes gap in time between me leaving home and arriving at my dad’s, and I would never imagine that something life changing could happen in those 25 minutes. I arrived, talked to my dad and step mom and just like that decided to check my phone. On the opening screen was the most heartbreaking text I ever received. My boyfriend had texted me only one sentence that said it all « I need you, my mom is dead ». I was so shocked I felt a wave of cold all over my body and my knees gave up. I had to grab a chair to not fall down completely. It was completely unexpected, she was so young and she never told us she was sick. 

I was wondering if this happened to anyone else and if so what is your story of your knees giving up due to emotions?"
raisedbynarcissists,fnyv9x2,t1_fny3s4y,1587376988.0,"Moving past her abuse doesn’t mean you forget and forgive what happened. I get that she denied her bad behaviour but the way I see it, you being miserable your whole life as a way to get back at a dead person is sad, and from my perspective, she wins if you give up on happiness. She wanted you to be happy, yes, but every parent does, even narcissist. It’s just that narcissist have a twisted view on things. « I want you to obey me, respect me and love me regardless of my behaviour. Oh and please smile and be happy you ungrateful child ». They want to see you happy because seing you sad is like putting a mirror to their faces. By being miserable you are showing them their behaviour is wrong, and god forbid they ever be wrong. I get that you feel like by being happy you give her what she wants, but she is dead! And even if she wasn’t, it’s your life. I don’t remember if you said your age but you still have a long way to go in life. 40+ years is very long if all along you focus on not being happy and for what? To not give your mom the satisfaction of seeing you live a successful life? 

I’m sorry if I get frustrated over this, but even if I understand why you feel the way you do, I can’t pretend to agree... I have fought so hard for my happiness... My mother was abusive. Yelling, screaming, and poking where it hurts, it was her way to vent out her frustration and stress. I was her punching bag. She called me ungrateful for not appreciating all that she did for me. I was a child who did not love their mother and did not appreciate all the sacrifices she did for me. I was confused as to whether I was supposed to accept her behaviour or not. Even after years of low contact and attempt healing, I am still messed up by what she did to me. Even without my mom around in my daily life, I had learned so many self destructive behaviour and thoughts, I was abusing myself on my own, without her being present. I was miserable. She gave me so many mental health problems I can barely function as a human being. I still consider myself inapt socially because she thought me wrong. I can’t set boundaries because I never learned to be respected. And still in all this, I fought to be happy. Because she made me unhappy for so long, even if I am used to it, I never want to go back, I don’t want my whole life to be the same as it was with her. My happiness is self made. She played no part in it. I did all the effort. I am the one who fights daily against my mind to be happy and someday I lose, sometimes I win. My life is not perfect, I have many issues and toxic mentality to unlearn, but I am somewhat happy. It’s an improvement. She is and will always be my childhood torturer, but I am stronger and I will be happy. Not for her, but for me. It pains me to see that you’d rather be sad. Because I know you could be happy and I can try and help you be happy. But I can’t help you be sad. Even if I could, I can’t possibly want to make you sad to get back at her. That is just not right. You have the right to be happy. You deserve to be happy. I used to think like you, trying to get back at people, trying to make them feel guilty. I even wanted to pull a 13 reasons why kind of stunt (before the show even existed mind you). And it’s when I saw the show that I realized how ridiculous it was. I did not wanted to die because I was done with life. I wanted to die because I wanted all the people who hurt me to feel guilty forever. I was hurt all my life up until that point and I wanted to hurt them back (my mom and other shit people in my life). I wanted them to have my death on the conscience. I can’t help but see a similar pattern in your thought process and it worries me."

I think it’s best you try to not care about family’s opinion. If they sided with your mom while she was alive, they will still side with her now, even more so now, because talking bad about her would be talking trash about the dead. Of course they’ll gaslight you if they did when she was alive. Your whole family sounds narc in a way. It’s pointless to try to get into their emotions, to them it wasn’t abuse. Don’t go finding yourself 15 Nmoms by trying to convince your family that you were abuse. It won’t change your life. They won’t say sorry. You are not their business. Get better for your own sake, not just to prove a point. 

I’m not suicidal anymore but I used to be, and I wanted to pull a « thirteen reasons why » kind of bullshit. It’s when I saw the show that I realized how pointless and stupid it would be. I don’t want to hurt my Nmom, I just want to be happy. Being dead (as an atheist) is NOT being happy. I did what I had to do, tried to heal, and now I am in a much better place. I don’t feel like I have to get back at anyone for leaving me to suffer. Why would they care if I lived the rest of my life sad and miserable?

I’m sure you would notice if she took 30 pounds. I’m sure you would be just as uncomfortable talking to her about it.
