WeAreTheMusicMakers,f1vaoqa,t3_dauafm,1569768688.0,"With guitar you can create chords and melodies, also there's tons of lessons for guitar, it's a more complete instrument overall.

The thing with bass is that you generally only do melody and rhythm of one note at time, you could try creating chords but the bass frequencies don't tend to sound good when there too many notes stacked together, it creates a sense of mudiness, however you could play a two interval hand shape, with it you could emulate a bit of piano playing in which you could add two bass notes, the best sounding ones will be those that use two notes from different octaves like E1 with G2 for example.

You can study general music theory with any instrument, you have, it's a thing every serious hobbyist musician should do.

As the others have said you can go from one to the other if you learn proper technique for both, it's not the same albeit they're from the same family. You'd have to learn to have a different picking, fingering and hand position, but it can be done.

Whichever you choose remember those instruments are used in a lot of genres so there's always new things to learn, don't get into the mindset that bass is pretty simple, you can do a lot of things with it, listen to some funky, jazz or latin music so you can hear more of what the bass can do, pop and rock don't tend to use the bass to it's full potential, metal being the worst example in general.

There's no shortage of guitarist, bassist and ones that really play good are uncommon, the rarest breed for a band being the drummer, as bassist you'd have people wanting to play with you if you are good.

There're indeed bass effects but guitar ones have more variety.

Even if my answer sound like learn the bass, you can choose whichever you like and then go for the other, but as the other said guitar skills translates better to bass than bass skills to guitar, but it's feasible either way.

Remember that each intrument requires dedication and lot of time to play good, if you practice three or more hours daily in 1-2 years you will be playing with enough skills to form a band, so I wouldn't advice picking both even if there's cheap instruments.

I hope this helps."
