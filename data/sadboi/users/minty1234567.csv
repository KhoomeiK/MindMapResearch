CautiousBB,fjnrmk6,t3_fbly2r,1583513187.0,"I‚Äôve had spotting since 4 weeks on and off, and I‚Äôm talking red blood. I also spotted for a whole week the week before my BFP.

I‚Äôm 8 weeks now and still getting it occasionally. Went to ER twice at the beginning because I was worried and everything was fine, then got an OB she said spotting and cramping are both normal. 

I don‚Äôt even get shocked or worried about seeing it anymore, I‚Äôve just had to go on pelvic rest (not by doctors orders) for a few days at a time. 

Only be worried if it‚Äôs a lot of blood and if there‚Äôs intense cramping. I had a miscarriage before at 5 weeks so I pretty much know what to look for. Trust your body, you‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs a miscarriage. 

Some words of encouragement I‚Äôve read across different platforms because I‚Äôm a born worrier:

‚ÄúI spent too much time being worries of loosing the baby that I didn‚Äôt enjoy the time I had pregnant‚Äù

‚ÄúWorrying is suffering twice‚Äù

‚Äú40 weeks in, and I‚Äôve learnt that the only constant in pregnancy is change‚Äù"

CautiousBB,fjnpcui,t3_fdwred,1583511962.0,"I‚Äôve been trying to to wake up a whole hour before I have to get out of bed by going to sleep earlier. This gives me time to eat breakfast (in bed) then go on my phone until the food kicks in. Also heavy carbs really seem to keep my nausea down.

If I get up too quickly I feel terrible.

The tiredness is just so shocking, I never knew it was this hard and now I‚Äôm worried about how it will be when the baby is here! I‚Äôm napping in most of my spare time."
