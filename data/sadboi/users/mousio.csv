Best way i found to deal with that, is 1) finding what you like and firmly pursuing that  2) making your disagreement known.

aftergifted,fm0156u,t3_frzrsh,1585640662.0,"Warning: Long rant incoming.

Couple things to consider:

0) it's normal to feel the way you are before college. It's different to what you've been through till now, and that's throwing you off balance. It's normal. No need to fret over it too much.

1) so you've found out there are things you're not good at. But don't let that cover the things you ARE good at. That's important. That's normal. That's life.

2) when you're distressed, you tend to only find the bad side of problems (i.e. failing), but there's also the good side (finding solution and learning from it). College for example, may look like a gargantuan dungeon when you haven't figured it out; don't know where to begin, or how to proceed, what's needed for what, etc. So try to relax a bit before asking yourself ""what do you expect it to be like"" or ""what do i need to know before entering there"" and ""what do i want to learn while I'm at it"". The answers will look much different then, i tell ya.

3) If in your case, you're afraid to fail it because you're not used to working hard, one solution is to set a minimum task bar (what you are easy at) to do every day; whether it's reading, or writing or doing certain tasks. If you managed to do more, great; but if not, you still has achieved your goal. I know that may sound like it's not enough, but trust me, here's where slow and steady gets better results than the usual fast and furious😅. 

or any other way. It's just about building habits that helps you slowly get used to more. Finding your own pace, to say the least.

4) One of the major problems of us over-achievers is that we think we have to solve everything on our own. So i commend you on taking the initiative to seek help☺. 

Thing is, in regards to college, you're not the only one going there, nor are you the first. Whichever field you wish to persue (and I'm assuming it is something you like, since speaking from personal experience, won't be worth it otherwise), there are classmates, seniors and alumni who you can seek out for assistance. It seems scary, but (generally speaking) they have been (or are) through this; they know what it feels like to be a freshman. They can give you advice on how to go through it, and you can sort them out to see which works for you and which does not.

That's about all i have to say. Honestly, what you're feeling now is normal. It's okay to be nervous before a new experience, but overthinking it only makes the problem seem bigger than it really is, so try to relax. You'll be just fine.

One last thing: if you want to try any medication or routine, i highly urge you to consult a doctor first. This is something that will have serious repercussions on your life, and without proper supervision it may be lethal (i.e. i started taking ambien on my own to help me with sleep, and it turned my life into a living hell because, apparently, i am one of the rare few who get temporary dementia from that😑. Who knew😐)"
OnePiece,flqs4ms,t1_flqmyuq,1585404802.0,"Mate, Chill out🙃. I wasn't trying to one up ya, or  (though seeing how the comments are on this post are, that's to be expected😅).

as for why (at least on my front; can't speak for everyone) it's because oda has been very upfront honest about how he has achieved this; what he has gone through, the problems he had to face, the process (steps,revisions,procedures,etc.) That takes behind the scenes for the series to run smoothly for all this time. And that includes what you've pointed towards in your comment☺.

So when you say oda is a cunning man because of such and such, to us who have been following this for so long and know the whole story (or at least know the situation a bit better) it sounds naive, and quite frankly (pun intended😆), a little insulting😐. So that's why, we offer that correction🙂.

Again, i can't speak for everyone, but that's why i said the above comment. Hope this helps😊"
OnePiece,flqhiod,t3_fpy7fe,1585395027.0,"I understand where you come from, but you didn't do your research well. All this examples have other reasons for their changes.

What you've missed is that most of these where from back in the day BEFORE One Piece became the worldwide phenomena it is. According to oda himeself there was a time one piece gained very little notice among it's audience, and he qas very sad for this. Eventually it gained speed and rose to become the No. 1 manga in japan, but it wasn't  always, and so editors didn't have much reason to interfere with it.

Besides, what you're refering to is mostly from early days when oda was still tinkering with everything untill he's satisfied with the result. Back then nothing was still set in stone; Zoro was part of buggy's crew (simply called the bodyguard) brook's design was super realistic, and nico robin was not supposed to be part of the crew (according to oda). 

And the addition of seven warlords was oda's own idea, a little after manga started serialising if i remember correctly🤔.

Though I have to say that yes, Oda is pretty good at dealing with editors; not for having any negotiative cunning, but because he is ""so far AHEAD"" in the story, so ""Crazy Prepared"" and so ""creative"", that that when they told him (in the shabondy arc) that the crew are lacking proper competition and it's getting boring, he created the brats of worst generation IN TWO, THREE HOURS. This is the insane part.

In your father's case, I don't recommend toleration. If you're still hesitant, ask yourself whether it's worth the,mental and physical, trouble? If yes, then go ahead; if no, then spare yourself the agony.

BUT

In this case, that's not helpful. Specially since spell-checking can be done with any electronic device easily (if he has a pc to play games on, he can run office or grammarly for spell-checking).
This is a case of him being lazy, and your compliance with him reinforces his laziness. 

In a relationship, each person involved has to do their part, not just expect the other party to do their job for them because ""they don't want to do it"".

What you need to do is make it clear for him that while you do care about him, doing his job is not part of the deal. On this, you have to be cool, but firm. My suggestion is to set a time (like in a month) that after which you will not be doing his work for him ""no matter what"", and gradually lower the amount you handle untill that appointed time. This way you can show him you are serious, give him time he needs to practice this and more importantly, OPEN UP ABOUT WHY HE CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LEARN SPELLING. 

This is important. As a former (and possibly current😅) procrastinator myself, I can tell you this problem of his usually has a deeper root (bad/suppressed memory, fear of failure, etc.) And untill that root is found and dealt with, even if he tries to fix it, it will feel like a forced chore; his progress will be little and slow. Making him feel like he can trust you with whatever it is that's actually bothering him (which he himself may not know at first) is going to be very important. 

I strongly recommend you enlist the help of a professional councilor since doing this alone won't be easy (barring that,someone he listens to and/or respects is also good). Also they are more experienced in these fields and can give you a better evaluation. That always helps. Ultimately you have to make it clear to him that while you are ready to help him solve his problem, dumping his work on you over being in a relationship IS NOT AN OPTION. 

Don't worry. This is solvable but needs to be addressed, instead of being ignored, lest they become the feather that breaks the camel's back.

Not so much with the direction your going. Real life has way too many systems to go by, Most universal of which could be rules of survival (And physics). Though that's assuming there is death in that world. Otherwise I'd assume it would be the rules of lessening pain?

As I said, your idea is pretty uniqe in that field (there was this anime nicknamed ""lord of the flies in space"", but it's classic now) so it has potential. So you're golden there.

The achilles heel is going to be the narrative details and PoV . Like, at what point in the story do we first enter the picture? When it was first launched, as one of the beta testers? or maybe an specialist sent in by utopian stodios after none of the testers wake up in due time? Or maybe an agent investigating eden after utopian studios has come under scrutiny? Or a hacker? Or...

depression,fi0ldet,t1_fhyjbop,1582039608.0,"This is sound advice. The only thing i can add is, if you're on medication, and have been for a while, ask your doctor to change. I have been taking ambien (zolpidem) for 7 years due to stress-induced amnesia, and two weeks ago went to a different doctor; who prescribed other drugs for me and told me to take them instead. Two days later, the fog that's always covered my mind was dissipating. Turns out I'm one of the rare cases that get hangover-like symptoms even during day time. Who knew😒?

In my previous doctors' defence though, that is a prety rare case of reaction and they couldn't just assume it is going to be like that. Proof being the other one of the drugs this new doctor prescribed me dropped my blood pressure and i had to go under serum😑😅.

So, uhhh... I hope this helps. This at least may narrow down the hodgepodge of options a bit. Less things to worry about.

And ""PLEASE"", if you decide to try this, consult with a professional first. There are a lot of dangers in trying to figure this out on your own (and i say this from experience); A professional would at least watch out for anything that may go wrong and cause an emergency. 

Just, hang in there mate. We're with you."

Would advise against drinking/smoking though.  Few things left from med school but i know for a fact alcohol makes the after effects worse, even if it lessons the bump a bit.

Then again 😒"

The lack of drive and energy; annoying forgetfulness that feels alzheimeric; feeling disabled while there's no scar on my body, and just telling myself I'm being lazy.
And knowing what i am capable of, if only i could muster more power.

Good... whatever, mate! Ain't sure what I can do right now, but here's someone who might get what you're going through, even if a bit. So...

And maybe try to trim a few pounds? That may help soften the expression on your face. That is, if you want to."
