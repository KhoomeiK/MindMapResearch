BipolarReddit,flicjnw,t3_fg103p,1585179702.0,Story of my life.
ADHD,fliccj5,t1_flic9ve,1585179588.0,"Except for some reason I still went through what you did, he was and always will be golden child"
ADHD,flic9ve,t3_fozpcx,1585179545.0,I think the same thing happened to my little brother
ADHD,fkgdu8b,t1_fkdk89m,1584156799.0,"No he just likes to do exactly what you said and disregard my struggles because he ""deals with them too"". But he will rip apart his mother for not recognising it when he was a child and how much further in life he could of gotten if he'd had the extra help. 
He says this to me, diagnosed and medicated at 6 til 17, who's just getting her life on track at 24. I was the kid he talks about, and I've not had this success he speaks of. So that too makes me feel ashamed. 

He understands the spectrum, in fact next time he brings it up I will remind him of this spectrum and that my experiences aren't the same as his even if he is ""ADD"""
ADHD,fkgd83d,t1_fkdnpy6,1584156301.0,"This is exactly how I feel, the double standard is insane... its ok for him to experience emotions like anger and frustration but its a different story when its me. I'm also bipolar 1 which he doesn't really understand, he thinks I just need to ""control my shit"" 

Man I wish he could spend a day in here then maybe he'd finally understand what a good job I'm doing at managing myself, which he doesn't think I do well."
ADHD,fkdi1lp,t3_fht7ch,1584079556.0,"My partner is convinced he's undiagnosed ADD so that automatically means my symptoms are invalid because ""he deals with it fine"" 

So much frustration when I'm having a moment"
ADHD,fjcgg53,t3_fcp632,1583219143.0,"Break it down into smaller sections and reward yourself after each section, I find this helps me become less overwhelmed and more motivated to finish a second, sometimes two if I'm on a roll! 

Rewards can be as simple as a cup of tea, a little hand/foot scrub and moisturise, a walk outside in the sun (or under the moonlight depending on your study hours), a shower, a snack. Whatever floats your boat. 

I avoid scrolling through social media as I lose track of my break time and I'm back to not studying ðŸ˜…

Hope this helps"
ADHD,fjcdozq,t1_fj6h0ay,1583216239.0,"If people understood adhd better then maybe my mother wouldn't have believed that Ritalin was the cure and the typical adhd behaviours I exhibited were just me being defiant, lazy and ungrateful..."
ADHD,fj5e78z,t1_fj5dqrs,1583030544.0,"Yeah me too, the internal guilt trip sucks"
ADHD,fj56ebh,t1_fj4uzfr,1583025290.0,Seeing it explained like this is so fucking comforting for some reason.
