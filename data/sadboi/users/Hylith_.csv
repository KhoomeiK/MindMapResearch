the trick is to spend the good amount of time for each one of these task and repeat.

2 seconds macro, 1 second scout in the early to train multitasking.

then later 2 sec macro, 2 sec micro repeat, keep tab on what your opponent doing, don't let your army idle as well.

The hard way :

If  you want to be relatively 'good' at late game you can learn to defend while doing a fast castle then boom 3 Town Center 100+ villagers, 8 barrack, 8 range then proceed to terminate the IA with a swarm of unit even trash unit with some rams or trebs will work.

* Spend your money

After your build order, if you feel lost you have to try to spend as much as you can. Too much wood ? Add farms and production build so you can do thoses skirms 8 by 8.

You're doing good if you spend all your ressources while keeping a constant villager production.

* Check your pop regulary so you don't forgot to build house

If you have too much wood you can have 1 or even 2 villager constantly build houses ( queue them 5 by 5) or smth

* Keep a presence on the map

Let's say he did wall and you explored most of the map, keep your scout active around his base, so you can see what kind of building he's doing and you'll know when he is rushing you before he is killing all your villagers.

* Adapt to what you see

You see 2 range pretty fast after feudal and many vill on gold, you're getting archer rush. Prepare skirm or light cav to defend...etc

Maybe thoses bugs are related.

They are so many little improvement on pathing to do on this game. Pathing in general seems really sketchy. Also the villagers going all the way around to mine gold the least efficent way possible on their own is fustrating.

Starcraft 2 had this thing where they finally decided to automatically send worker to mineral at the start of the game with the first expension, it's just some little thing that improve the quality of gameplay that at first don't seem important but when you multiply them in a game with sometimes 100+ villagers lossing so much time due to bad pathing is annoying.

Some little improvement to simplify macro where it dosen't really count and require players less apm to deal with villagers bugs would be nice.

But lossing the fight because my army can't properly fight is even more fustrating and game breaker than villagers bugs.

You just use the same digusting argument to everyone who disagree with you and i'm calling you disguting for saying that i make excuses for racism and imply that i'm just try to silence people suffering it. Learn to read and try to actually understand what i'm saying and not making an assumption.

It's like two people talking, one is telling the floor is green and you're the guy that reply ""it's not red it's blue"" and the first keep saying ""you don't understand, i'm not saying that it's red, i'm saying that the floor is green"".

No, you said ""racists, who can be anyone anywhere.""

>A psychopathic photographer obsessed with innocence and drugging and kidnapping students is far more niche and obscure when compared to racists, who can be anyone anywhere.

You're so out of reality it's insane, there is no point having a discusion with you. You admit that the situation of Sean is **unique** but then you take their situation as a good representative of reality... And then you compare **regular racism** (in your first post) to **jefferson** & **life threatening racism** (in your second) to **jefferson** but not  Sean situation to jefferson, you're being dishonest and you don't even reply to half of my legit and argumented response. If i were to use the same dishonnest argument you just made (switching the comparison) that would be : having a creepy professor is far more likely than life threatening racism.

People like you discredit themselves by going after anyone for anything. I'm not denying, I'm just relativizing the situation Sean is in. You treat me like I'm an accomplice of racists by having a different view on how the game treat the subject... You're disgusting and dishonest for trying to shame people for not having the same opinion as you. What a way to make people dislike you... Have a good day in your far west."

lifeisstrange,faa0f78,t1_fa8ix48,1575898596.0,"So you think what happened to Sean was just lambda racism that happens every day? Let me ask you how many young Amercians his age see their father killed before their eyes by police officers and then assaulted several times and almost killed? Sean is the target of almost every conceivable racist act in a very short period of time.

Be honest, what happens in the game is so cliché that it becomes almost ridiculous, when i read your comments, i get the impression that the United States is still in an era of the wild west and slavery and that any white person could suddenly want to kill a Mexican. Being so much in the overbidding in being victimized is not honest.

Of course racism exists but most of the time it is remarks or even insults and in rare cases it can lead you to a fight. A life-threatening situation is extremely rare and what Sean has experienced is a lot of major acts of racism in a very short period of time, it is extremely unlikely.

Yes, racism is present in the US, yes the Mexicans are suffering it, yes there is a big community problem but no such acts of violence are quite rare for what happens to Sean to be very improbable.

So the question to the thread was "" **Are Mexican-Americans face this much hate in real life?** ""

And no is the only honest answer, not in this frequency and intensity for one person. It is as if the experience of racism of many Americans of Mexican origin had been condensed into a single person."

BTS have some part are very well done while other are not. You can see how Chloe and Rachel met when they were 16. The bonus episode is really good, It follow Chloe and Max when they were 13."
