Fibromyalgia,fo95itl,t3_g6c1gb,1587611019.0," Sounds very similar to what I have! I’m 24F and have been diagnosed with Clinical Depression, IBS-M (Mixed: meaning I experience diarrhea and consolidation) and recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It took my physician a really long time to finally diagnose me.

In regards to stomach issues I assume most of it is caused by IBS: Extreme bloating and cramping in my abdomen and ribs, feeling sick when I first start eating or don’t eating soon enough. I also experience intense periods nausea and dizziness at times. I have horrid acid reflux that causes awful chest pains. 
My IBS mostly flares up when I’m on my period so I can definitely understand the whole feeling like your periods have gotten worse.

In regards to my Fibromyalgia, I often experience tingling in my hands, arms, feet and legs. Various types of pain in my hands, neck, back, arms and legs (so basically everywhere LOL) I’m also unable to regulate my body temperature and I do have periods where it’s also very difficult to concentrate.

My mental health is currently affected by my physically health and unfortunately my physical health is also affected by my mental health. Mental health can play a big role in how extreme my symptoms become. When I give into the negativity and anxiety I have about my symptoms it’s kind of a downwards spiral with both my IBS and Fibromyalgia 

I’m on a couple of different medications but unfortunately there isn’t much out there medication wise to assist with fibromyalgia and gastrointestinal disorders.

Please reach out to me if you’d like to talk! It can be frustrating being so young but having your body feel so broken. The best medicine for me has been having support from people suffering with similar issues as mine. If you ever find yourself feeling like you can’t talk to anybody because nobody understands what’s actually going on with you please drop a message! I know it’s hard to make doctors appointments amidst all this chaos but definitely see if you can get an appointment and get properly diagnosed when this all dies down."

Screw those people who keep telling you to buck up and be positive and that “everything will be fine eventually.” Those are all just BS words they use to attempt to soothe people they can’t understand.

AmItheAsshole,f746amv,t1_f70qy5d,1573398787.0,"From a restaurants perspective, we don’t seat tables in the dining room who only intend on consuming an appetizer and/or drinks. The percentage tipped out for drinks(bartender) and appetizers(food runner and busser) in the dining room tends to be higher for servers than for bartenders. Bartenders don’t tip out of the drinks they make and their tip out percentage towards bussers and food runners tends to be lower as well. By prohibiting drink and app only guests from the dining room it potentially increases the servers earnings and also helps bring business to the bar. If I’m ever running the door I ask every table if they’re dining for dinner, if not I send them to the bar. The only time I’ll put an appetizer and drink table in the dinning room is if my bar is full and I don’t have a wait for people who intend to have full dinner service. 

I understand that these things tend to be very confusing towards those who aren’t in the industry but there’s an explanation 99% of the time we tell you something.  As a host, manager and server I have always politely informed tables at the end of the meals that the dining room is only intended for full dinner service and that guests who just want appetizers and drinks are required to dine at the bar on busy nights.  It’s never meant to be rude of disrespectful, just a heads up so they don’t potentially feel singled out next time. 

The only time the appetizer and drink rule in the dining room doesn’t apply is during lunch and slow business nights with a low reservation count; sometimes it doesn’t even apply if you’re in and out after consuming your drinks and appetizers. Not every restaurant enforces these rules but with higher priced establishments these rules are in place to financially benefit employees, the owners and reservation guests. These rules help the restaurant run more efficiently. I’ve had the occasional person feel very upset about rules of this nature but these rules are meant to optimize efficiency, encourage reservations and even out the restaurant. 

The manager and server didn’t react or communicate this policy well by any means but I just thought I’d give a little background as to why these rules tend to be set."
