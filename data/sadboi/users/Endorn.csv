Not because trump is better, but because democrats cannot continue to move towards republicans and serve corporations if we want any progress in this country.

If Biden wins, he’ll put a center right pro-corporation judge on the SC. Whatever vet Er right VP he picks will likely be the democratic nominee on 2024. If she wins, she’ll be on the 2028 ballot as well.

So now we’re looking at 2032 before we get a single change to move away from the neoliberal center right agenda. Over the course of those 12 years, the Republican Party will be pulling the spectrum further right, and democrats will follow. We’ll probably have placed several pro corporation judges on the SC. The entire political spectrum will continue to shift right and pro corporate.

If however Biden looses, we only get *one* pro corporate right wing judge on the SC, and we can try again in 4 more years. Of neoliberalism loses twice to Trump, I believe the Democratic Party will be forced to accept the center right ideals are no longer viable and we can finally have a progressive president in 2024&2028 putting several pro-citizen judges on the SC, and finally make some big positive change in the country.

politics,fqhph38,t1_fqhlgn9,1589381767.0,"I’m one of those.

The problem with incremental change is the tag alongs. It’s *exactly* like the virus stimulus. The American people got a tiny bit, giant corporations got trillions.

If all you look at is incremental change, then you’d say that was great. Having $1200 is better than having nothing.

But now we’re at a place when the republicans aren’t going to allow us to have a single dollar more because they’ve already spent so much on corporations.

*if* however we had a Democratic Party willing to fight, and fought to make that $1200 a recurring monthly payment we’d be massively better off, even if it meant delaying the immediate benefit.

Another analogy is food. In this moment, I’d much rather have a hot dog than broccoli, but in the long run I know I’m much healthier and better off eating broccoli.

So there’s *obviously* a line in which people think a candidate is too far to the right to vote for even if they’re the better of two options.

Neoliberals like Biden wall a very fine line with that. But just because he doesn’t cross *your* line doesn’t mean you have to force that same line on others.
