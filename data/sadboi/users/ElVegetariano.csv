harrypotter,fq8tm8o,t3_gh3lss,1589175172.0,"This is going to be pretty controversial.

I think Harry dying at the end would‚Äôve been a great ending.

Half of this comes the dissatisfaction of the fairy tale ending epilogue, and lousy pairing of relationships between the characters. He just goes on the rest of his life living as a normal wizard and having a family and a steady career and blah blah blah. I‚Äôm my opinion it‚Äôs just lame, beating the bad guy, fulfilling the prophecy, everyone‚Äôs happy in the end, okay fine.

The other half comes from me thinking about how poetic it is. Harry was always the boy from the cupboard under the stairs. From the beginning of the whole story, Harry‚Äôs life was about going from a bleak, miserable, lonely existence, to finding out about a world filled with life, friendship, and knowledge of his past. He went from being ‚Äújust Harry‚Äù to The Boy Who Lived, but more than that, he found adventure, he found magic, and he found friends. Hogwarts was and forever will be Harry‚Äôs home, and him moving on from the place that changed his life forever doesn‚Äôt fit the story. Harry is the type of character to die for his friends, he literally does it in the books, but the fact that he was brought back to life is just too convenient. I‚Äôm not saying he should‚Äôve died in the forbidden forest, I think him and Voldemort should‚Äôve gone down together. Harry dying for the place that gave him everything that was missing from his old life would‚Äôve been beautiful in my opinion, and it‚Äôs nice to think that he‚Äôd be rejoining not just his parents, but Sirius, Dumbledore, Snape, Dobby, and all the other characters he fought for."

LifeAfterSchool,fps2o6j,t1_fps1dy4,1588866454.0,"Yeah, the thing about music college is you have to do some basic stuff like theory and sight singing before getting to hunker down on what you really wanna do, if you have a scholarship, you could see about going for like a year maybe and find out whether you can handpick the classes you think would actually be beneficial. Music colleges have an extremely regimented plan to get you to graduate their way, but to do that you‚Äôd have to take asinine courses like music history and basic keyboard (which I‚Äôm sure you probably already know how to navigate, and even if you don‚Äôt, just watch YouTube videos). If you have the ambition and motivation to do exactly what you want, you don‚Äôt need a full college ride. If I were you I‚Äôd look into going for one year, but maybe not this fall depending on where you live..."
LifeAfterSchool,fprxyui,t3_gf5zak,1588864140.0,"I would only go to university if you got a scholarship or can afford it without going into debt, otherwise, don‚Äôt go. If music production is something you can figure out how to do on your own, you have no need for college. Something to consider is to get private lessons from an audio instructor at the the college you applied to, but these days, everyone has a college degree, it really doesn‚Äôt mean much unless you also have a lot of your own work to show off, which college projects would get you to do, but you could just also do them yourself."
