A few days ago my sister was talking about this one friend of hers who “super ripped and hot” and other stuff. She then proceeded to say that if he ever sends a dick pic to her she’s going to send it to her gay friend. I was furious I practically yelled at her saying how that’s awful. She didn’t give a flying Fuck. She just said “it won’t show his face” and “my friend has pictures of a bunch a dicks and he wants to suck (hot friend) dick. I then asked if this “hot friend” was bi or gay. She said no. I then asked how she think this is ok, and her response was bullshit. I wanted to talk some sense into her so I turned the tables. I asked her if she thinks it’s okay for a guy to send a picture of a girls nudes to his/her friend. And she just avoids the question. I was beyond pissed! My sister call herself a feminist and all that but she thinks it’s okay to send a guys nudes to someone. Thankfully this “hot friend” hasn’t sent her any nudes. And for his sake I hope he doesn’t."

teenagers,fnzgp29,t1_fnxldfq,1587393731.0,"Don’t rush yourself. Allow yourself to grieve, it’s okay to be sad. Losing a pet is so much harder then people say. When my pet rabbit passed away I was devastated and years later it still makes me sad. It’s natural to feel sad or Even depressed. People often don’t realize that losing a pet is like losing a part of yourself. It took me a long time to fully recover from my loss. But now when I look back on all those memories I smile because I know how lucky I was to have my rabbit and all the amazing memories I made with him. I know that I was able to give my friend a loving house and he was part of my family. 

But please don’t rush yourself. You don’t need to learn to let go, allow yourself to over time. 

If I could go back in time and change my life so that I never had my rabbit just so I wouldn’t have to say goodbye I wouldn’t. It’s true I miss him and I still love him but I am so grateful for the memories I have of him. Because those happy memories are worth so much to me.  They show me that I truly cared about him and he cared about me."
