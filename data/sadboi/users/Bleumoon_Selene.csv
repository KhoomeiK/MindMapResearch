I personally didn't really enjoy it. I go into detail in other comments. 

>Did you get to graduate earlier? 

I graduated at the normal age, 18. But I know there's kids who graduate early!

>Was your parents super fun when homeschooling? 

No. My mom took us to a museum a few times and that was fun. But overall it was my dad who taught me and he often lost his patience with me. 

>Any advice you can give me,?

Be patient. Learning is hard sometimes. I remember I really struggled with math. I would be able to answer all questions except for a few and would be really stumped. My dad often lost his patience and would scold me for not paying attention or slacking off. 

And if your kids struggle with paying attention, or learning the material, for a long time you may consider finding out why via professional help. 

It turns out I have ADHD, and if my parents had me evaluated as a kid I probably would have had a better time learning. 

And listen to your kids. Sometimes material is boring or difficult to grasp and you just cannot take it in at all. So don't be afraid to try different approaches. 

My brother always thought history as it was written in the books was boring, so I would read it to him and phrase it in a more modern and easy to understand way. 

You have to adapt to them just much as they have to adapt to you. 

I also recommend having as much of a proper schedule as you can. Try and build a routine. 

Also, don't be afraid to answer questions with, ""You know, I don't know the answer to that. Let's look it up and learn together."""

I'll tell you that my mental issues have nothing to do with me being trans. Unless you count dysphoria, which is something that many, but not all, trans people use to describe their discomfort with their birth sex. It's refered to as a mental condition and is treated as such, but it's merely a side effect and not a cause. 

For example many people with chronic illness or disability find themselves to be depressed because of their condition. But depression is a side effect of how they feel about not having control over their bodies. That's dysphoria for trans people. 

I have severe anxiety and depression. That has nothing to do with my gender and treating those things doesn't make me cis (not trans). If anything it helps me think more clearly about my gender and how I feel about it.

Some people say that trans people need more hormones of their biological sex. That people born male should take testosterone and people born female should take estrogen. 

Now, I can't speak for my trans peers, but I've been on estrogen and progesterone. It makes me an absolute wreck. My depression spikes, my dysphoria worsens, I hate everything. 

In essence, you can't force someone to not be trans. Just in the same way you can't force someone to not be gay, or to be another race.

When he was a kid (or teen) a teacher mocked him and told him he would only ever be a loser. 

He's addicted to heroin and in jail. 

So I guess it stuck with him."

gadgets,fh726xr,t3_f1gixg,1581312581.0,I saw a documentary once of a woman who had a surgery to do this very thing. It was decades ago I'm sure. But at the time the whole thing was disturbing and sketchy. The doctor was the first one to do something like that and the woman was basically a test subject. The implant in her brain stuck out of her head and it never fully healed. How she didn't suffer from infection I have no idea. She couldn't even see with the device plugged in so she rarely used it. She could only see like a dot sometimes if conditions were right.
