Which is something I’d never been told before, despite having done therapy for 9 months with a different therapist. The first therapist was really good at helping me find all the points that had me hurting, but she didn’t help me heal from them, so I was left feeling exhausted after every appointment. Now though, I feel like my new therapist is genuinely focused on helping me work through my traumas and figuring out how to move forward. I think some of it depends on how far along you are on your journey, but if you start to realize that your therapist isn’t helping you focus on healing, please speak up or please think about seeing a different therapist! This is first and foremost your journey, and your therapist is there to help guide you. Remember that therapy is quite draining because it’s dredging up all of the things that have probably been stewing under the surface. This can register like reliving the traumas in some ways, so please treat yourself accordingly and be gentle with yourself. I’d recommend asking your therapist if you can leave the sessions on a positive note or with something new to think about, because that hope is what reminds you that you’re not in that place you were when you first experienced the trauma. You’re somewhere else now and you can begin to heal."

traumatoolbox,fgvza84,t3_eh0gev,1581154930.0,"Tw: Suicide attempt
I would say this counts as traumatic. 
Back in September I attempted suicide, and was taken to the hospital. While at the hospital, and for the first few hours after getting home, everything felt hazy and numb. It was like the weight of the situation hadn’t hit me yet. Flash forward two days and I’m washing clothes, and come across the clothes I wore to the hospital. I immediately started having a panic attack and later that night paced for about three hours with this intense feeling of anger burning under my skin.

After that, I realized that even though it was something I’d done to myself, it had been traumatic nonetheless. For a while it kept me up at night, and sometimes I would run into something that made me think about being back there in the ambulance and the hospital, and I’d start crying or panicking. It took some time to figure out what all the triggers relating to it were and practice being patient with myself and slowly getting used to the exposure. Again, emphasis on being patient and kind to yourself. This is a difficult process and it’s gonna hurt, just accept it and breathe. Don’t be mad at yourself or your body, just practice being in the moment and forgiving yourself. It will help in the long run"

But also at the age of 13, I saw a girl near my age with scars up and down her arms at a summer camp. I quietly stopped her and asked if i could talk to her about something. I told her I’d seen her scars and that I had them too, and that I was sorry she was hurting. We hugged and sort of went our separate ways, but she remembered me when we crossed paths near the end of camp. I’ll never forget that. Because of this, I feel it depends on how she’s already feeling and what kind of empathy she experiences. If she’s anything like most of us, moody and angsty and probably not having a fun time with that age, I can understand the fear of exposing her to it. However, it’s not like you’re dripping blood and telling her about the awful things you think at night. She might not understand and she might think it’s weird.

enfj,fberpt4,t3_ebipen,1576792382.0,"I totally get you. It actually took a long time for me to be properly typed because of this. I had untreated depression for roughly five years, and was very anxious as a child. I didn't fully understand why the symptoms were so aggressive, but it seemed to be resulting from having really emotionally neglectful parents.

As a young kid I was totally a social butterfly and very smart. I loved learning and I had possibly never met a stranger. As I got older, my parents became a part of an almost cult-like subsection of political advocates. I was homeschooled and constantly told that kids my age were 'brainwashed' and that 'the economy, if not the entire country, is on a downward spiral towards poverty and war'. I was probably seven or eight at the time. Because of this rhetoric, I didn't talk to other kids, didn't socialize, and mostly didn't see my parents because they were busy helping out with their political group. I spent most of my time alone. I read more than half of the books in the library targeted at my age group, then pretty much devoured the young adult section. I didn't have friends or close family, I just had me and my books. This went on until they enrolled me in a private school in the seventh grade, which naturally I failed miserably at, because no, they didn't teach me while I was homeschooled, so I hadn't had proper education since the second grade. I was an outcast in my pier group, and I was distraught.

Over time I managed to catch up, I caught on to the social cues of my peers and slowly learned how best to relate. I got my first computer around the same time and made it my mission to figure out what was popular and what my own interests were. I developed my personality. I started making friends. 

I'm in my first year of college and I can't hardly walk through campus without running into a friend who wants to stop and talk. I take on additional projects and coordinate information in my groups. I'm a strong leader and I am socially comfortable. I've kept my close friends from junior high and do my best to love and support them even with my now-busy schedule. I'm in my element and away from my family, who have settled down on the 'political terror agenda' and I'm working with a therapist on healing some of the wounds they caused me. Distance and the freedom to flourish helped me so so much. Try to make positive contacts and don't be afraid to give yourself time to heal."

It’s sort of the continuation of a cycle of trauma, and which is why I don’t call her my abuser, and we’re working on repairing our relationship. At the time, my mother had been repeatedly reminding me that being gay would cause me to go to hell when I die, she’d been upset and cold, I was scared all of the time of what she’d say next. My therapist was sort of blinded by the fact that my mom was somehow homophobic in the 21st century, and insisted on bringing her to the office, despite me repeatedly warning her that it would result in me getting hurt after, and that my last therapist was fired after telling my mom that there were things wrong with her parenting. She asked that my mom come to the office anyways, and pretty much sat with the two of us facing her (bad idea btw if you Don’t want the person across from you to feel threatened) and told her that she was ridiculous and needed to join modern society. After we left, my mom asked me if I wanted to move out. At the time I was no where near old enough to do so, but I was panicking so I said yes. After packing up all of my belongings and calling a close friend, I was ready to leave, but my mother changed her mind, and told me I was ruining our family by walking away and she wouldn’t speak to me again if I left. Basically, she panicked and when my therapist went after her, I still live at home and am still living with the consequences. My mom doesn’t trust me.

I’m an older sister, my baby sisters are 14 and 16 years younger than me (yeah, they were definitely a surprise but a great one). I love them to death. My middle sister I’ve had the biggest hand in raising because she was born in circumstances that I were difficult for our mother, so I sort of took the reigns for a while. When she was an infant I would often play soft music or sing to her and just hold her for hours. She had reflux which caused her to be in a lot of pain, so I did my best to make sure everything around her was comfortable. When she got a tad older, I always made sure to use a calm, sure voice when I speak with her and try to make sure she knows I’m willing to acknowledge any strong feelings she’s having and that we can work through them together. 

She’s in the toddler/little kid years right now, so we spend quite a bit of time working through frustrating or sad moments. If she feels hurt or upset, I offer to hold her and we sit for a while and I’ll hum and rock her. The idea is to take enough time to settle down and do something quiet or distracting while still being able to process the emotion. 

We also always tend to do tasks in small pieces. I remind her that we have to clean up blocks, then books, and then we can play ball or watch her favorite show.  Yes, we can have chips, but also we should have some milk or something with protein. A lot of it is balance, not being strict for the sake of being strict, but because there are certain things that are good habits and that will help her stay healthy and happy. Also, tickle fights are awesome. Watching Disney movies together? Fantastic. And it’s nice knowing I have a buddy who thinks the outdoors are just as cool as I do. 

I know these are a slightly more parental choice perspective, but one of the best freedoms of being a sibling instead of a parent is getting to be a little gentler, a little more understanding. It also means I can spoil them rotten with stuffed animals and treats and things, and I can be there for them if they need an adult who isn’t our parents to lean on. I never realized how important other adults were in kids lives until I was almost all grown up. I wish you luck and remember to have fun, take care of yourself and take deep breaths. Above all else, be gentle and firm, and show yourself the kindness you deserved as a child."

Why don’t I have transcripts? Because I’ve technically been ‘homeschooled’ the past several years (I attended a small private school) and also because I was unable to finish the last five years of school. I spent my junior high and high school years suffering. The first several months were exhausting, dealing with a shortened attention span, anxiety, and fatigue, but the last months were always hell. I’d spend all of spring practically unable to get out of bed. The program I was in offered college style ‘classes’ so I only had to be there two days a week, meaning leaving bed was something I only had to do those days. When I was in class I’d feel my heart rate speed up and I’d get jittery and scratch off patches of skin on my neck, wrists, wherever I could reach. At home I wandered about like a ghost. 

It took four years to get help. For all those years I slipped in and out of severe depression before anyone stopped to think maybe I should see a doctor. I had begged before. I pleaded to see a specialist or a therapist, but neither of my parents believed there was an issue. I failed another year of high school while trying to adjust to the medications and spent the whole summer scared out of my mind that I would fail out of college too and have a horrific academic record to show for it. Thankfully, I was able to find and adjust to the right medication for me. I’ve been seeing a therapist I like for a while now and my family is in family counseling. I got lucky. I’m doing quite well in college because for once I have the mental faculties to handle it. I have support from my friends and therapists. They’re helping me learn that I’m allowed to ask for help when I’m struggling and that, miracle of miracles, I might even get that help. 

If you’re willing to listen to your kids and support them, they’re already going to be leagues ahead of most of us on here. I’m always grateful to hear about people who want to break the cycle and give their kids more than what was given to them."

Also breasts are usually fairly proportional to the body, and you’ll still pass even if you don’t give yourself double d’s, start towards a b or a c cup.

It hurts yeah, but it’s consistent and could probably be validating. Lots of other trans dudes I know wouldn’t mind the ‘awkward puberty boner’ thing, so I really don’t see why people think there wouldn’t be trans girls who wouldn’t mind the ‘awkward blood stain’ thing. Maybe if it weren’t all so taboo I guess."

She wants to keep control of me, when I’m good I get small bits of affection, and when I’m bad, she says she can’t be my mom anymore. She tried to train me like a dog, not to care about myself, to worry about her first, to not become someone she wouldn’t like, to never leave. Then, she was angry I had become so boring, so submissive. No fun to play with anymore. She didn’t want an eldest child. She wanted a family dog. Ever since realizing that, it makes sense that I’m a stray."
