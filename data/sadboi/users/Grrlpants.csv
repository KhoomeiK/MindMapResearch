DarkSouls2,fpf77le,t1_fpeshas,1588563454.0,"I want to add to this list a bit:

6) Many retextured bosses from ds1 with not more explanation attempted. Obvious laziness.

7) With out a doubt the one game in the soul series with the most areas/mechanics that feel unfair/poorly designed. So many parts where it's almost 100% that you will die from some bullshitty thing that was unavoidable of you don't know it's there. The other games have it but ds2 has the most by a lot.

8) Poor design decisions that nullify mechanics from ds1. Bonfire aesthetics for starters. They really doubled down on the ""fuck you"" mechanics from some parts of ds1; meaning stuff that just feels like the developers going ""wasn't that shitty haha!""

9) Many parts of the game feel unfinished or have game breaking bugs. Earthen peak for starters. Many parts of the game feel like they just took assets from ds1 and copy pasted them into a new game. Ds2 is the only one in the series that feels like they could have named it something else and it would have been fine. The story is just so far removed that it might as well be a different series 

10) No bosses stand out to me as extremely memorable, while a lot feel like mini bosses with a health bar."

summonerschool,fls9mvx,t3_fksiiu,1585437309.0,"Ok so, I've played about 30 games over the last week. I have had, and I'm not exaggerating, THE worst luck I've ever had in this game. 1 in 3 of my games has an afk. I have won lane in probably 25 of my games, pretty hard. Usually 3 to 4 kills up and 30 cs up in gold. Of those games where I do well, more than half of them have a top laner that is just straight up inting. I'm talking, 0/6 by 15 mins. I'm really starting to question if there is something wrong with the match making at this point. It seems like I'm playing at about a plat level, when my team is all in bronze. Every season I've made it to high gold or plat pretty easily, and usually stop there. But I am having a really hard time wrapping my head around whats going on. Is anyone else experiencing this? Ever game I say, ""don't int and i will carry."" I dumpster my lane, and by the time laning is over, the game is already lost because of top. What can I do as adc? Doesn't seem like there is a solution. Most games I lose and get an S rating. Usually have over 10 kills, less than 3 deaths. I hit 5 items by 20 mins but literally can't do anything vs the insanely fed top laner. What do I do?"
