AskReddit,fm9vgio,t3_ftxizh,1585877479.0,"I have schizophrenia. There are some common misconceptions. First, schizophrenia is not multiple personalities. That's dissociative identityÂ disorder. Two, schizophrenia does not make people violent. In fact they are more likely to be victims of violence than to commit violent crimes. Three, schizophrenia isn't just positive symptoms. Positive symptoms are something that add, like hallucinations and delusions. There are also negative symptoms, or symptoms that take away. These are things like blunted emotions, anhedonia, loss of motivation, and poverty of speech. There are also cognitive symptoms, like disorganized thoughts, memory problems and difficulty focusing. Everyone thinks of the positive symptoms when they think of schizophrenia, but personally the negative and cognitive actually bother me more. Finally, it is totally possible for someone with schizophrenia to live a completely normal and productive life. I struggle with this, but I've met people with schizophrenia that have advanced degrees, badass jobs, and families."
