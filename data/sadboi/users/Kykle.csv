Adressing some comments:

Scene numbers. Yeah, I forgot to remove them. I use them as a writing tool to keep track of everything. I number my scenes when I outline so it helps me when I'm actually writing.

You're making me realize that I might have gotten ahead of myself on this script. I have so many ideas for the ""world"" and the bible that I might have only unsuccesfully implied certain things that a reader wouldn't be capable of picking up.

For example, Gil is definitely kind of an asshole, but is only that abrasive due to the divorce. And their marriage was initially one of companionship and love that eventually turned sour.  How is the reader supposed to know that? Well, in this draft they really can't.

I somehow neglected to mention the ""didn't finalize the divorce"" technicality, which is just a super impressive thing to forget to add. Go me.

I'm less conflicted on the assholeish of all the characters, but that's kind of my ""brand."" But I agree that I absolutely need to give more depth and complexity to Rose in that regard. I knew that I was doing a bit of a disservice to her as I was writing the script, but intended for the ending to make up for that by having the twist being that she is actually the protagonist of the story. I'm now thinking that that is too little, too late.

The implication is that Billy died around that same age and is therefore still that same age in the afterlife.

Again, thank you much. If I wasn't flat broke I would Venmo you some beer money or something."

careerguidance,fmfaw43,t3_fuwy9w,1586023430.0,"Your post is too vague to give concrete suggestions on the situation.

Are just supporting yourself or do you have a family? Being a breadwinner has entirely different ramifications than flying solo, or having an SO that could help support you during your career shift.

What do you actually do? So many sectors of the economy have slowed or shut down and it's impossible to know what your options even are without that information.

Would you be leaving for a job in the same field or seeking out a new line of work? Many, if not most companies, are unlikely to hire anyone until AT LEAST June and that's a best-case scenario. Further, the job market is about to get a lot more competitive than it has been over the past decade and if you're worried about being overpaid now then you should absolutely be worried about what salary offers for new hires are about to look like. I can't imagine now being a good opportunity to start an entry-level job in a new field. But again, that depends on your situation.

Do you have a (useful) degree and if not, have you considered getting one? Now might be a good time, depending on the circumstances.

I could go on with questions like this, but I hope you understand what I'm getting at. There are numerous factors that go into what makes the best choice for your career, and even then it's still going to be a pro vs. con and risk vs. reward situation.

I had the opportunity to pitch the concept to some producers in LA and they had some interest in it. The manager who setup those meetings liked the idea but wanted it to be more substantive and less slapstick, which I found to be an interesting challenge. 

Going into the outline all I really had was this logline: A blue collar Florida man is reluctantly drafted into a local biker gang after gaining notoriety from a robbery gone wrong. Unknown to him: he has been chosen to become the scapegoat for a much larger a corporate esponiage conspiracy.

Screenwriting,erzb5ow,t3_c4y1gd,1561430613.0,"I just starting having an issue with the undo function. No matter how much I've typed or deleted, I get the message ""Nothing to undo!""
