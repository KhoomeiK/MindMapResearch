Documentaries,fmee563,t1_fmdqvdj,1586000663.0,"1. It was the flu season, they couldn’t confirm it was an unknown new virus so similar to flu that leads to pneumonia until around 12/26, investigations started on 12/27, local CDC reported to Beijing on 12/29, WHO notified on 12/31, CDC issued warnings to public on 1/1 to wear mask in public.  Wuhan and basically the whole country was shut down on 1/23 and 1/24 before Chinese New Year, Teams of experts and doctors were called to Wuhan on Chinese New Year eve.  China did what many other countries did at the beginning, yes they downplay it at the beginning, to not cause panic and for economic reasons, but to be fair there were only around 30 confirmed cases by the end of December.  They were able to trace back some of the earlier cases to the beginning of December later on.

2. The death rate and confirmed cases were definitely not accurate at the beginning, many couldn’t get tested, not enough hospital beds, many were sent home and some died without getting tested.  That’s why 2 ICU hospitals were built and 20 more makeshift hospitals in the city, by February the numbers were fairly accurate, because the quarantine was very strict. Most Chinese live in apartment complex, most were not allowed to leave the building, or their door at all, all food and essentials were delivered by community organized volunteers, very few were allowed to leave the building, when they did, they had to have some kind of permit, signed out at the building door, temperatures are taken when they leave and came back.  And No one is allowed outside without a mask.  And that’s most of the country, not only Wuhan and Hubei, For rural villages and towns, they have guards at the village entrance and did not allowed any outsiders into the village, even their own kids were turned away.  
This was how the curve was flatten.

And Wuhan is a city with 11 million, an average of 4000-5000 death everyday without the virus, with 70+ days of lock down, non were picked up since 1/23.  And where did the number 45000 came from, this number seemed to be increasing everyday, it’s 3 times higher already within a couple of days from the first time I read about the accusation...

3. The so called wild animals are not really wild, they are farm raised.  There are about 1 million registered merchants that sells these farm raised wild animals in China, and by banning it would destroy their family and income.  Some are from very poor regions and just got out of poverty by breeding and raising these animals.  It definitely should be banned, but China is still a developing country, it will take some time.  Shenzhen just became the first city in China to passed a law that forbids the consumption of many wild animals and also dogs and cats. 

4.  I agree, the CCP sucks by international standard, but for many Chinese the CCP did a lot to improve their life.  China was one of the  poorest country in the world half a century ago.  Even today more than 20% of the population still live in poverty, and that’s by Chinese standards, if you compare to the west probably 70% still live below the poverty line.  The CCP’s effort to alleviate poverty is actually praised by many international institutes.  And freedom of speech wouldn’t matter when you need to worry about food everyday.

The Anti- Chinese campaigns has been going on forever, foreign medias rarely reports anything positive about China, only negative things or even demonized version of certain events, and after decades of listening to such reporting, most people that’ve never been to China wouldn’t have a very good impression.  And many cannot seem to distinguish the country’s current ruling political party from the people living in that country.   Anyone that say anything good about China is brainwashed, sometimes I wonder who is brainwashed...I just read about this white girl posted on social media that she wished the whole country is wiped out from Earth..."

But I’ve always wonder, what does refusing to pay for public transportation(MTR), teaching and encouraging others on how to skip MTR fees, vandalizing public properties like street lights, brick roads, trash cans, trains, buses, railroads, banks, toll booths over and over again, leaking police’s personal information online (why that council woman was arrested for), ENCOURAGING the BULLY of cops’ children in schools, vandalizing private properties like Chinese owned stores and restaurants, celebrity owned stores and restaurants because they support HK police or spoke out against the protesters, harassing customers at these restaurants by taking their photos and post them online to get their information, beating up people that speaks Mandarin and say they love China in public, beating up people that tried to stop your vandalizing, burning that older gentleman alive because he was trying to stop the protestors from vandalizing the MTR station, killing the other old man by throwing stones at him because they were trying to clean up the roadblocks the protesters sat up...has to do with the 5 demands?  And the people arrested for the above crimes, you want then all released without any charges?"
worldnews,fknrgme,t1_fknqjmx,1584372371.0,"Yeah one official, and only one is barking, and does that senator that accuse the wuhan lab leaking the virus represents the US?  Is the US government backing that conspiracy theory?  Don’t tell me you actually buy into these conspiracy theories."
worldnews,fknmymx,t1_fknlu8w,1584369548.0,"Of course not lol, I am just stating what the Chinese side of the conspiracy is saying, people really need to stop fueling these bullsh*t to create panic.  Btw the first conspiracy theory that the virus actually started in the US didn’t come from China, it actually came from Russia and this Japanese news channel, they said that some of the death in US related to flu back in October and November could be the covid-19 because a percentage of cause of death were undetermined due to some unknow virus.  These type of fake news and irresponsible journalism is what caused the panic today."
worldnews,fknhv32,t3_fjj83b,1584366129.0,"Lol this bs conspiracy theory again, Chinese state media does not support this, it was just something to throw back at the US conspiracy of the virus originated from that bio lab in Wuhan, which is also bs.  this article conveniently left out they were referring to the 2019 Military World Games, officially known as the 7th CISM Military World Games and commonly known as Wuhan 2019, was held from October 18–27, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.  Over 100 countries participated, including USA, their hotel was very close to the wet market and there are rumors that 5 from the USA team are dead already. I wished politicians would stop with all these bs conspiracies and divert their attention on how to stop the virus."
