AskReddit,fk3yu4e,t3_fgachy,1583849608.0,"18 year old student here! the schools were shut down last thursday & we've gotten our homework and school-work through online portals as of right now, but i know most people have online lessons with their teachers. we won't be able to go to school until the 3rd of april (though i unfortunately suspect the government is going to extend it)

i'm in my last year of highschool, so my classmates & i are freaking out over the final exams that are supposed to take place in mid june. oh also our school-trips have been cancelled, which sucks because everyone has been looking forward to it since we started highschool :/

generally we're not supposed to leave our house, unless it's for necessary tasks like going to work or to the grocery store. my region isn't as affected as others (we have about 50 infected people), but personally i'm very anxious right now & really miss a ""normal"" daily routine like going to school :( it's not even been a week since schools have shut down & i'm already starting to become depressed since i go out so little, not sure how i'm gonna survive the next few weeks since we're not even allowed to leave our city unless we have a valid reason to. i hope the situation will calm down & things will go back to normal, in the meantime i encourage all italian redditors to follow the government's guidelines, together we can survive this!"

Crushes,f2puhgq,t3_ddzebl,1570350599.0,"he's in my class and at the end of last year we grew kind of close and would talk a lot during and after class, but after the summer we just weren't as close as before. we never really talked outside of school though :/ anyway, i feel like slowly we're starting to talk more again, it's just idk. he's really confusing me. sometimes i think to myself HE DEFINITELY LIKES ME because he'll stare at me the entire day or constantly be around me, or he notices small things about me, but then other times when there'd be obvious chances for him to make a move he doesn't acknowledge me? plus there's this girl he's friends with that he apparently has a crush on (can't confirm or deny anything since i've only heard other people say that he tried to flirt with her but she rejected him lol) i feel like one day he's super into me and keeps sending me signals (that i don't really reply to.. i'm awful ik but i just get awkward and avoid him bc i feel uncomfortable) and then the next day it's like i'm invisible. i know my behaviour doesn't help but i'm just very anxious and i get awkward when he gives me attention"
Crushes,f18h5a3,t3_d83pzo,1569257721.0,"I mean, hate and love are 2 feelings that are very close to each other. I've never crushed on someone I absolutely hated, but I've had instances where I caught feelings for someone I disliked and found annoying. I think sometimes you feel attracted to people, even if you dislike them, but there's usually some underlying ""positive"" feelings that have been there all this time. Or maybe you realize the person isn't all that bad and your brain just switches suddenly. Not to mention those weird dreams where you're romantically involved with someone you dislike and it just messes you up because you're grossed out but also deep down enjoyed the dream, or is that just me?? lmao"

Crushes,es2wn63,t3_c5c6wf,1561544543.0,"So recently I've had dreams about my crush pretty much on the daily basis, I'm guessing it's because I don't see him irl so my mind is trying to make up for it or something lmao. Anyway, my dreams are usually very realistic scenarios that are close to our relationship irl, just a bit more flirty I guess? The most memorable though was a few nights ago, it was so random, I was in my classroom during break and so were a couple of other classmates of mine, and I was sitting next to him, eating and talking to somebody else, and he just put his head on my shoulder and I was caught off guard and kinda chuckled awkwardly and said ""well someone's tired, huh?"" and he stayed like that for a little until he grabbed me by the arm and then just kissed me?? I was kinda shocked because it was so random and there were other people around, but they didn't seem to pay any attention to us hahaha. Then other times we just talk awkwardly with each other (like irl) but we tease each other more or, for example, last night I dreamt that I sat on his lap after he took up all the space on my chair. It's odd, really, these dreams always feel SUPER real and the way we act is 99% accurate too, sometimes when I wake up it takes me a while to realize that it was all just a dream. It's crazy because your mind literally creates a detailed relationship with this person, so much so that sometimes I ask myself if we were to actually get together would that relationship be able to be as fulfilling as the one I have in my dreams? Lmao sorry for the weird thoughts"

Crushes,erben6a,t3_c16gz4,1560675708.0,"Been there, it sucks :/ ik this person means a lot to you, but you have to realize that if they don't care for you and appreciate you nearly as much as you appreciate them, they're not worth your time.

Crushes,eqm4yej,t3_byt404,1560156421.0,"To me it sounds like he's definitely interested! I'd suggest you keep up contact with him over the summer via texting or something, maybe you'll end up meeting up :) Even if he were to just see you as a friend (though to me it seems like he's attracted to you more than a friend would be), it's still great to keep in touch! In my opinion you have nothing to lose! And btw I completely relate with you about the whole awkwardness around people haha, but I think that just goes to show how comfortable you guys are with each other, since you can talk with him for a long time without feeling awkward. Hope this helped a little :)"
