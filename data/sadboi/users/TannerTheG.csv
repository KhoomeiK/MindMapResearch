LegalAdviceUK,fr4792u,t1_fr46muo,1589878299.0,"It would be meant more as a much shorter time frame, if you pay in 1 month it's 110%, you cannot find that good of a loan... The reason it would go on is to avoid debt collection for as long as the customer can just afford £10 just in case.
I literally thought this up on the toilet man chill.
Go online and find any loan site which will give a student (no credit history) a loan that's 110% if they actually loan it to them at all...
1200% of £100 is £1200 btw mate, it's 220% if you pay after 12 months. That's still very cheap compared to most...

For this, the overall interest for £100 is then just (100+10n)% where n is number of months waiting."
