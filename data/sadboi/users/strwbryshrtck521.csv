In their reception room, they had this weird purple/ blue lighting, which made the dress appear stark white. The poor woman was mortified! She almost left out of embarrassment, but the bride and groom were absolutely fine and had a good laugh about it. 

Meanwhile at my own wedding, a guest (friend of my mom’s) wore a sparkly white gown. It was a black tie wedding, and maybe she just wanted a chance to wear it. I wasn’t upset about it, but I definitely face-palmed when I saw it!"
