We need more women being proud of their bodies!!), then you need to get rid of him!! Someday, you might want to have kids and you'll become pregnant and you'll gain weight so if he can't deal with your weight fluctuating then he need to bounce because there is no way this dude is going to appreciate you when you're pregnant and putting on loads of weight or when you become older, the physiological changes that will no doubt happen. If he cannot love and appreciate all of you then he isn't worth being your fiance. I hope he comes around and changes his mindset. But if he doesn't ditch him!!"

wemetonline,fol4t0n,t3_g827d4,1587854893.0,"Dear OP,

I'm really sorry this didn't work out even though you may have thought there could be something more. I think it was in your best interest to end it because it seemed like it was affecting your mental health, and the ""friendship"" seemed to have become more toxic as time went on. Sometimes, LDR can work but it takes two people to really want it to work. It seems you both wanted different things in life and in this relationship- you wanted to meet him and have a serious relationship, and he wanted to have a more casual, short-term kind of thing. Neither is wrong. Now to play Devil's Advocate: perhaps, after weighing multiple options, he came to the only logical conclusion/or answer to not pursue it further- distance. Someone can be totally attracted to you but then plans change, people change; logistics often come into play. I don't want you to think you deserved it or that it was something that was inevitably going to happen but unfortunately, you cannot force people to want a relationship, let alone a LDR. I really hope you are able to heal from this. LDR are hard- have been there and they take so much work and attraction is not the only thing that comes into the efficacy of LDR- there's a bunch of other factors that come into play. I'm really sorry it didn't work out :(. But take this time to heal, to find something to get your mind off of him, and everything will work out. If you ever need someone to talk to, please reach out :) Best of luck to you."
sociallyawkward,fol0b1u,t3_fcrpv0,1587852367.0,"Hey OP! Honestly, if this were to happen in a lift, I'd probably laugh it off (internally) and wouldn't think much of it. And if a person put their hands up, I'd probably smile and then look back down at my phone! However, word of advice, if people are giving you weird looks, don't feel that you need explain anything to them! They don't need to know what's going on with you and they shouldn't expect a response from you either. Also that girl seems rude! I'm glad you made the most of the situation though and that at least everyone was laughing- perhaps it lightened up their day and I'm glad the situation made you laugh!! But like honestly, we all have those awkward moments- trust me, I wouldn't want to touch a lift button after I'd just washed up either!"

You are stronger than you think. I know right now it doesn't seem like it and it feels like the world wants you to sleep and maybe even you want to.

I know it may seem like there is nothing to live for, no purpose in living each day but I promise you it does get better. There are so many things worth living for. God has put you here for a reason even if you don't see that reason. There is always a light at the end of the tunnel. We all want want you here. If you are struggling, please please reach out to the following: 741741 or the national suicide helpline:  1-800-273-8255. You are valuable. You are strong. You are important.

wemetonline,flyy1lc,t3_fokt9t,1585611433.0,"Hey OP, do not take this to heart, I promise you it just isn't worth being upset over. You were not impatient, in fact, you were so patient with him that it was breaking you down mentally. Of course, this will take time to heal, all things do but you need to know you did the right thing. He wasn't treating you with love and tenderness and care. He was not allowing you to confide your problems to him. He was using you as his personal therapist. He was hurting you deeply because he was an insecure person with his own hurt that he has not dealt with yet. Just know you did everything you could do to help him and while it did not work out for you, just know this too shall pass. It is ok to feel sad. Please do not apologize to him because it will only reaffirm to him that you are nothing more than someone to take care of him and be there for him but he cannot reciprocate those feelings for you- when you do this, you are damaging your own self-worth. I hope everything gets better, and if you do need to discuss this, I am more than happy to chat :)"
wemetonline,flyx1a4,t3_frr5rz,1585610841.0,"Hey OP, firstly I'm sorry that this has happened to you :( unfortunately, the internet can be a dark place even if it feels that you know a person, especially for a grand length of time. However, I am going to play devil's advocate for just a minute: why did you leave it as a statement:  ""you don't ever want to video call do you?"" This could be interpreted as a sort of passive aggressive statement and perhaps he felt forced into doing something he was not immediately able to do. I would ask him and very directly ""Does the thought of Skyping make you afraid of what I will think of you?"" Then read his response. If he says yes ask him why. If he keeps avoiding it, then you know your answer - you know that he most likely will never want to engage in a conversation via Skype and if that is case, then I'm sorry, that sucks to have a friendship end in that way :(. However, if the answer is no, ask him a follow up- ""Would you be interested in doing a Skype video-call today?"" If he says no, ask him ""When would be a good time to do it?"" I think being super upfront and direct is the best way to go! Since you know this person for a year, perhaps it is in your best interest if you want to keep the friendship alive to communicate about the problems you are facing. Try not to be passive, just guide the conversation. You got this OP!"

socialskills,flhw937,t3_folk1x,1585170667.0,"Hey OP! First off, that's awesome you were able to connect with this girl - you're right it is difficult to find such a connection especially on a dating app such as Tinder. However, while it may seem that the rest of these posts appear cynical, they bring up a valid point. 1) You are interacting with a girl who just got out of a relationship, I would monitor this- sometimes when people get out of relationships, they are looking for a rebound. Be aware of this! 2) I was in your situation a while ago, I met this guy who appeared so kind and good and we were talking for 4 months off the app and we were flirting and everything- I just found out the dude was a liar and had a girlfriend. So be sure that you both can meet in real life! LDR and online dating is tricky. It's hit or miss. Of course, I hope she isn't stringing you along but be sure to monitor closely and know what you want! Hope it goes well!"
relationship_advice,flfius9,t3_foi01m,1585107722.0,"First off, thank you OP for taking care of that cat. I can tell you are a good person and you care about animals. That is a great quality to have! I am so sorry that your girlfriend can see you helping an innocent animal as somehow wrong. Personally, if my man tried to tell me I couldn't do anything to save an animal in the freezing cold and was yelling at me saying I was irresponsible, I'd drop him! However, I'm going to play devil's advocate for a minute. Do you think perhaps your GF is traumatized over a past incident with a rescued cat? Do you think perhaps she fell sick or became ill when she came into contact with a stray cat? I think it's best to talk this one out. Tell her you love animals and that it is something close to your heart. You got this OP! Stay strong and again thank you for caring about that cat."

I think Andre\_iTg\_oof put it perfectly ""breath."" And they couldn't be any more right! Just breathe, watch some funny videos, play with your awesome cat, sing in the shower LOUDLY, eat snacks junk food, chocolate, and most of all take care of yourself. I know you're scared and anxious but this thing, this virus is going to go away at some point, I promise you! So for the time being just breathe enjoy the moment. Take things one day at a time.

It will no doubt be difficult the first couple times around but just try and find it within yourself to take the leap! One thing that helped me make a lot of friends and start conversations is to just notice something about them,anything- if they're wearing a super cool shirt: tell them, ""hey, I notice your shirt! It's so cool. Where did you get it from?"" And from there the conversation flows. Since you love the gym and working out, there may be some people(you've mentioned people that you'd like to get to know more) that may have the same interests as you so you could ask them ""hey, my name is X. I really notice how you're working out with X machine, X workout."" If you're feeling more ambitious you could go up to them and be like ""hey I've also wanted to know what new exercises people have tried that recently helped them in x aspect of life?"" And just go from there. I hope you're able to break out of your shell- it definitely can be hard to do! just now that someone would be lucky to have a conversation with you! Wish you well OP :)"

It isn't worth trying to fight for something that doesn't exist anymore. Eventually, they will realize what they've lost and at that point it would be up to you to either take them back as friends or drop them all together. Sometimes the best thing you can do is be there for yourself!
