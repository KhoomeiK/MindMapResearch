That does sound frustrating. You explained it really well. I didn't realize a lot of these things existed, and I've loved learning about them. Thank you for your input!

Also, I'm sorry people assume you're less intelligent than you are. I can empathize with that on a huge level: people so often assume that me being blind also means I can't think, speak, or function at the level of a typical person. It's so frustrating!"
tifu,fj4u487,t1_fj3a6ph,1583016935.0,"It definitely does narrow the world down by quite a lot. When I walk somewhere, I'm aware that there is more around me than what i am directly, in that moment experiencing, but I won't take it into account unless I have reason to, or unless I specifically try to think about what else is going on beyond what i can touch/hear/smell.

I associate red with hot and blue with cold because everyone else does. It's little more than a vague association, though, the same as I might associate the rain with cold weather. My experience living in monsoon areas suggests that it can be perfectly warm (and sunny) while it rains, but most people think of cold and wind when they think of rain, so they talk about it that way, so I also associate it that way.

I do have some texture associations with colors, though, or experiences. It's kind of strange, I suppose, and wouldn't help anyone understand what colors are in any meaningful way or probably make any sense at all. They've just come to be that way for me because of correlation, I suppose."

I know what makes an apple up: it's shape, it's general size, the stem it has, the way it curves differently than, say, a pear. But I don't know if that knowledge/understanding would be good enough to comprehend seeing one. I also wonder how my previous ability to see (which was 19 years ago) would impact my ability to understand something I saw if I did gain vision back. I'm guessing those memories would just be gone and therefore lend no impact on anything, but it's still really interesting to think about!"

I couldn't see it, but I was aware of it being there because I'm familiar with the layout of their property. I couldn't see the kitten or my stepdad, but I was still just as aware of their presences as if I could see them.

I'm glad people make posts like this that raise awareness for these differences, especially so that people can understand that there are reasons why they feel so different. 

I have been blind since I was about 3, so for the most part I have no visual memory at all. I don't know if I have aphantasia; my experiences are similar to those who have it, but it's a product of just not having the physical ability to comprehend visual stimuli more than anything. It's a really intriguing concept! 

I don't know that I can construct images. I more construct... feeling something? So an example a lot of people have used is an apple: I can recall the texture, the various shapes apples can take, the stem and the bit on the opposite end. I can manipulate those properties to visualize different types of apples (only ones I've felt before). It's very physical.

Like, could you imagine the sand under your feet, the sound of the waves, the wind against you, the sound of people laughing? Are you still able to engage with the setting through your other senses?

tifu,fj39cct,t1_fj38v7j,1582974022.0,"Interesting!! When I think about something, I can hear the voices and remember how things felt. This is making me think a lot about how it works, actually. If I think back to walking to class yesterday, I know what I did, I know everything that happened, I know what it feels like to walk that direction, but I don't know if I recall the actual sensation of walking/being around other people or if it's more just knowing it happened and ascribing sensations as they seem appropriate. I'm even confusing myself! I do remember layouts of where I've been, and I think my second strongest aspect is hearing: I can recall the wind in the trees, the echos of my footsteps, the voices around me, things like that. 

I do a little bit of sculpting when I'm bored, and I've learned through showing those pieces that I'm good at recalling the physical details of things well enough to build them. In a sense I'm still very limited: if I sculpt a cat, it will be similar to my cat and it will be harder for me to build one I haven't seen. If I make a mask of a face it will be mine, because touching faces is super uncomfortable and doesn't actually happen. My grandmother did those mask things of mine and my siblings faces, where it leaves behind an actual mask? Idk what they're made of, but I saw them the other day, and it was the first time I was able to compare my facial features with those of my brother and sister. A total side note, but you made me remember it! And in that vein: I think about them and can remember the texture, the shape, the features, but of course little other sensory input.

I know exactly where I am and what's around me; it's like I just have an intuitive grasp on the world around me.

I do like reading in braille, but I rarely do it. Books become extremely cumbersome in that format. The first lord of the rings book, for example, is 7 or 8 volumes in braille if I'm remembering right. The fifth Harry Potter book is 13 or something insane like that. I've never bought a braille book; I usually just borrow them from the library. There are specific media centers where braille books are produced and lent out, which is where i went as a kid to get new books. 

 

There are braille devices which can be paired or connected to a phone/computer, and the screen can be output onto it in braille. A lot of people choose to read this way, especially because many of the devices are themselves standalone computers, in a sense, and can be loaded with books or documents. I used a device like that to do a lot of my schoolwork.

&#x200B;

I will occasionally listen to audio books, though my primary medium are eBooks. I have an app on my phone (voicedream reader) which has a wide range of voices you can select which will read things aloud. They're all pretty robotic and relatively unpleasant, at least to me, but I don't really mind it. I can have my regular screenreaders read the books to me, but this other way is easier."
NoStupidQuestions,filv0hz,t1_filu80p,1582511001.0,"Yeah; I think it's very easy for other people's opinions to affect the way we see... well, literally everything, including ourselves.

I am totally blind. I have prosthetic eyes, so I have no light perception or shapes or anything. A lot of people will use the word blind even if they have some perception, so there's really no good way of knowing what a person would prefer. Visually impaired seems to be one of the more commonly used terms, because it encompasses everything from total to even just needing glasses.

&#x200B;

I think there are far fewer ways of offending us than people tend to worry about. I know a lot of people are so scared to say the word blind, or even to say things like ""see you later"" or ask if we ""watch"" movies. These words are just words, though, and i have never once been offended by them. The creativity some people display when trying to avoid saying blind can be a little entertaining though, I won't lie. :)

I always say I watched/saw something, even though it's not literal. There are times when I personally struggle with identity words like ""disabled"", but that is a reflection on myself and my own insecurities, and nobody else. Unfortunately, plenty of people will project that onto the speaker when it's unnecessary."

I type on a regular keyboard. I sometimes use dictation, but it's not good enough at understanding what I'm saying for me to do regularly; I end up spending more time correcting things it got wrong than I do typing it out!
My screenreader has a lot of customization options. One of those is in regards to punctuation: I can have it read none, some, most, or all. i usually keep it on most, so that it reads things like :, """", ;, etc. It's enough for me to read back through something and figure out if I missed a mark. I don't always catch everything, but I do my best. :)
It will point out spelling errors, which is nice. I'm guessing it's marked visually if you've typed something wrong, but my screenreader just says ""misspelled"" before it reads a word.
There are some I don't catch, though. It's and its are read identically, and won't be picked up as a spelling error. I just have to be careful. I'm both an avid reader and writer, and I've done my best to learn proper grammar, syntax, and punctuation. :)"

My current partner is totally blind, as well. I've dated both visually impaired and sighted people in the past.

I don't think anyone's tried to set me up with someone and I've disagreed about their attractiveness. Perhaps that's because parts of what I view as attractive are dependent on other people thinking so; if someone tells me that someone is attractive, I go into it with a bias of already thinking that way. I'm pretty shy and introverted, though, so I don't often take people up on that kind of attempt. :)

I know some people do like listening to porn. I was recently notified that audio described porn exists, but that seems like it'd just be awkward and weird to listen to. I can't exactly speak about it fully, because I personally don't care for it, but I suppose people can just use their imagination in tandem with the, ahh, provided noises? 😂 It definitely is still consumed by us, though. i know some people prefer to just read romance/erotic books.

&#x200B;

As for appearance, it still does matter. Some people like to think we're these judgment free saints who don't care about physical appearance, but it's 100% untrue. Sure; I can't tell someones hair or eye color, or the shape of their face, but I can tell their body type and height. I also have asked my sister or friends about a person's more visual attributes so that I can have a better mental picture of what they look like. 

&#x200B;

For me, I prefer someone taller than i am (shocker there, I'm sure) and who is at least healthy in their body shape, haha. I prefer clean shaven, and I do judge a lot by how it feels to hold his hand. :) To me, the thought of dark hair and darker colored eyes sounds attractive, but I really couldn't tell you why that's the case, and I wouldn't ultimately care. Voice also plays a big role, as does if they smell nice or not. So I'd say that I'm as judgmental as your average person... unfortunately. I personally care a lot about personality, confidence, and ability to make me laugh. Those are the first things I will notice about a person, afterall, and it will shape how I feel about them if I have the chance to learn more about them physically. Even just giving someone a hug can tel me a lot about a person in regards to what i like and don't like."

NoStupidQuestions,filad69,t1_fil5vil,1582497123.0,"Everything is very linear for us. So there's no true concept of the left or right side of the page. If developers are nice, they will have broken up a page into heading levels. So a news page will have a heading level 1 above the story, a level two for different breaks in the article, level three for headings like related stories, etc. On the computer, I can navigate through these by pressing ""h"" for all headings, or ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", etc for different types. Most letters have a corresponding action: l for links, v for visited links, e for text fields. I can also tab through relevant, usually clickable information, or use arrow keys to move through every single thing on it: blank lines, text, clickables. To activate something, I hit enter or space. So it's all very straight forward once you understand it, and honestly doesn't leave all that much room for error outside of accessibility mishaps. 
The phone is similar, but with gestures on the screen instead of specific keys, if not using a wireless keyboard anyway. That leaves more room for error, because gestures can be misinterpretted or done slightly wrong, but I still seldom run into issues with it.

You did the right thing, though often it's more appropriate for her to take your arm. She will have more control by following you than being lead by you. :) It's good to ask what the person would prefer, because some might be more comfortable with one way over the other. It's really hard, for example, for me to feel safe being guided by someone holding my shoulder or something; When I hold their arm, I can follow their movements and have more warning about tight spaces and things like that.

It's always good to just ask! We are pretty independent, generally speaking, and though it may look like we're fumbling a bit or lost, we usually just need a moment to orient ourselves. It can't hurt to ask, though. I take no issue with a stranger asking if they can help me out, provided that they are okay and don't push me further if I say I'm fine. We are, unfortunately, used to people getting offended if we say no or continuing to push for us to accept their help, and it's lead to some blind people to be a bit defensive of being offered help. It doesn't excuse it if they're rude about rejecting help, but just a thought. :)

This is my personal opinion, and all of us are different in what we prefer and want. When I walk through a place like a coffeeshop, it's incredibly nerve wracking because tables are rarely laid out nicely, people stand and chat in weird places, people have their backpacks or things on the ground, and I worry a lot about being seen as incompetent. I can usually figure it out, especially if I go there frequently, but I tend to appreciate it if a stranger offers to help me find the counter/table/door. I don't often get asked if I need help, which makes me feel oddly good about myself, and it takes away the anxiety of thinking I'm being watched a little bit, but the thought is often appreciated regardless.
