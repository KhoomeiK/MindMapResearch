Anxiety,fojldy9,t3_g7n728,1587823893.0,"You are not alone in feeling this way - it is normal to feel overwhelmed with all your life ahead of you and feeling pressure (from society, yourself even) to choose a path right away. You know what? no need to stress further. You already know what you want to do, you said it yourself, that you want to help animals or people. That's the insight you need to use to inspire yourself right now and although you might not be ready to go to school, there are other things you can do, as other folks have recommended on here.  Perhaps it is best to take a step back for some time to clear your mind and do some experimentation. I think volunteering for a week or 2 at a vet hospital or something to that extent will help you see close and personal how the day to day is and see if that's something you'd like to pursue in the long term, but in the short term you'd be of service to others which will bring you a sense of purpose and joy;  When I was younger in high school I had to do community service hours and I went to a homeless shelter to cook for the homeless and to serve them food. It was an amazing and gratifying experience to serve them food , to see their smiles for a second and make their day, until this day I can't forget how filled my heart was. I know right at this moment it's hard , because of the pandemic we can't really go out and about, but these are all things to consider and to start getting excited about and researching.

Remember that you will never be a ""nobody""!! You have a beautiful heart, and you are selfless - I am telling you I wish the whole world was more like you, wanting to be of service to animals/people - this is the highest quality to have, which is coming from a place of the highest vibration, love.

Best of luck to you and stay positive, you have a beautiful light within you, let it shine bright!"
Anxiety,fohj55t,t3_g6u4dj,1587766829.0,"Thank you for your post! So many people are feeling this way now - I for one, have taken out my anxiety by snacking way more than usual - I have cut down some now (a bit more in control), but its ok I forgive myself for it lol and I am taking it day by day, if it makes anyone feel better, we are all on the same boat, and some have it worse than others ... 

What's been helping keep my sanity is going for walks daily, keeping distance from others, of course, exercising (weight lifting), and trying new recipes to make at home. Keeps me entertained and the outcome is I learn new skills.

The other thing I think about is that if this was back in the day without internet, we would probably be be feeling the effects of isolation or boredom much stronger... so not so bad but looking forward for this to pass."

I found this one called Pacha Health which has them in stock:

CBDEducation,foat874,t3_fpddba,1587652120.0,"I think it is fair to say that after a while of evaluating its effect on you , perhaps it just doesn't work, it could be the dosing, as others mentioned below - it takes some experimentation to see what works for you, starting small dosing and building up is always a rule of thumb. Or it could be that particular brand/formulation you're using is not effective on you. I'd try another product and see if the effects are better.  I'm not a doctor but it would be good to keep in consideration if you are taking meds, other things that can potentially be interacting with its effect. Always consult your doctor especially if your condition is not improving; as compounds like CBD still need to be investigated for their interactions with other medicines and effectiveness in larger more controlled trials.

 I know that in order for us to improve our mental health, it is not just one solution (e.g, taking CBD or other meds/supplements) but a combination of wellness and mindfulness lifestyle. With that said, the right medicine and dosing in combination with exercise, yoga,  behavioral therapy, meditation, support from friends/family etc -  all those things can contribute to us feeling better and can help with lowering anxiety and depression levels.

Below are some good resources I found that can help! Best Wishes.

Anxiety,fo7tq4m,t3_g66te9,1587584387.0,"Hey! I know it is hard but don't let it get the best of you! You are very young still !

A wise person once told me it is ok to feel down, angry, and whatever we classify as ""negative emotions"" - let them go through you but the point is to not hold them for too long to the point it becomes heavy and impedes you from living your best life. When you feel these energies, which are overwhelming, observe them and let them pass as if you are detached from them and don't judge yourself for feeling this way because we all have (and are) feeling similar emotions  right now!!

Let's use this time to learn new things, meditate, exercise, get creative! It will soon be over and we are all going through this with you, you are not alone!!!!

FLMedicalTrees,fo2zvzg,t3_fuy49j,1587477809.0,"I think you have to try it for yourself to see what dosing and intake method works for you, it is the same with THC products - always start small and work your way up. Also you probably know this but CBD oil with the precise mgs of cbd is probably the way to go, since the cbd is isolated, this is different than hemp extract oil (which contains cbd but at unknown quantities and  is cheaper - not to say that some people might not feel positive effects taking it!).  I found this CBD website, their blogs talk about mental health and CBD which can be a nice resource to have! [Pacha Health Blog](https://pachahealth.com/blog/)"
