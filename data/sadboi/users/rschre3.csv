PS4,fr57rbl,t1_fqvuqi9,1589903979.0,"A ""bit"" copy and paste. Every town is literally copy and pasted and rearranged. At least in Red Dead every building is modeled differently and there is a reason to explore."
PS4,fr52k08,t1_fr5080h,1589901363.0,27 million over the course of multiple games is amazing. Red Dead is an outlier and it probably cost more to make than all the Far Souls games combined.
ghostoftsushima,fqzxfua,t1_fqyg27r,1589777845.0,"Yep, pretty much. That's what I hated most about Odyssey. It was trying so hard to be player friendly that it literally took the difficulty out of everything."
ghostoftsushima,fqz9g4p,t3_gkzw5x,1589762671.0,"That aspect of the combat won't change. I don't know if it's a loading thing or not, but even AC Odyssey had a quick cutscene play before a dual. All I am saying is don't get your hopes up, because what you saw is what you are getting, aside from bug fixes and optimization."
ghostoftsushima,fqz91kf,t3_gln5e0,1589762426.0,"The game is beautiful, so the complaining about the graphics is absurd. The combat does have similarities to the earlier AC games, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. It looks like it will be animation based, which will add to the cinematic flair of the game. People, and maybe gamers, in general love to complain."
ghostoftsushima,fqz8lue,t1_fqxy85f,1589762160.0,Not likely. An open world game that looks like that won't be able to hit 60fps. Especially on the base PS4. I will be fine with a steady 30fps though.
PS4,fqubdm7,t3_gkxf2o,1589655677.0,The only thing that worries me is we will get copy pasted cities and towns. I wish Ubisoft would utilize their crazy amount of resources and so something like Rockstar or CDPR.
patientgamers,fqu9gyb,t1_fqu5nsl,1589654619.0,"Easy is like hard mode in other games. I played the game in easy mode and got stuck on the last island. I am new to these types of games, but it is hard."
ghostoftsushima,fqsgn02,t1_fqriazg,1589606743.0,"I enjoyed the gameplay of TLOU. I felt the resource management and Resident Evil gunplay really fit the narrative. Its not for everyone though and I get that. Its still very much a game though, only about 10 percent of it are cutscenes."
ghostoftsushima,fqsg7u2,t1_fqq9p56,1589606416.0,I feel they tried to go with a more realistic style. Batman and Spiderman combat works better with super heroes. Samurai spend a lot of time on defense and not lashing out continuously.
ghostoftsushima,fqsbxti,t1_fqrjssq,1589603267.0,"You have no idea what you are talking about. All signs point to the game being ready to launch in September. The game WILL be a current gen title, so this whole conspiracy that they are saving it for next gen is ridiculous. Do you have any kind of evidence to back your claim?"
ghostoftsushima,fqoqhkf,t1_fqoplr6,1589521909.0,"We could have a lot of missions like that with this game as well. As a matter of fact, I am pretty sure we will. Horizon, while being a great game, had a ton of those missions. It's not necessarily a bad thing either, it just needs to be done well."
ghostoftsushima,fqopxyb,t3_gk112s,1589521474.0,"The game is similar to the newer AC games. It seems to follow similar routines of clearing bandit camps and some of the combat techniques. I think it will be better than the more recent games, but Sucker Punch has definitely taken inspiration from Assassin's Creed."
ghostoftsushima,fqopn8t,t1_fqnajd8,1589521236.0,"I'm sure the map will be pretty big. Not as big as Odyssey or Origins, but big enough. I wouldn't get too hung up on the size of the map though."
PS4,fqofrnj,t3_gjyb0i,1589514240.0,"I wouldn't worry about it. From Software won't make something like Assassin's Creed. We literally have no information on it yet, so let's wait and see."
PS4,fqoeidy,t3_gk0vig,1589513445.0,I would just leave them unless it really bothers use. It may do more harm than good and it really doesn't look bad.
PS4,fqkjdmj,t3_gjazll,1589428615.0,"Ubisoft said it will be ""smaller"" than Odyssey. They said they removed the level gating, so you won't have to do as many side quests. Other than that, we don't have any information."
vtmb,fqg0qud,t3_gilxve,1589335539.0,"People are over reacting just a bit with the graphics. Sure, the animations are definitely stuff and the character models for the most part seem off, but the environments are great. I'm not saying it's going to compete with Cyberpunk or anything, but the way the city looks in the trailer really looks like they nailed it. I also want to point out that graphics were always going to be secondary with this game. The roleplaying and writing means so much more. Anyways, I hope we get a release date soon."
PS4,fqfzvl9,t1_fqfxops,1589335032.0,"No, don't do it. It is multiplayer only and most of the player base has moved on to Battlefront 2. Good news is that Battlefront 2 is also dirt cheap and it has a decent amount of content."
lifehacks,fqfcu3r,t3_gijrxd,1589322630.0,"Most of these businesses don't have sites, that's precisely why they use Amazon. Amazon handles the marketing and SEO of the products, not to mention they are capable of storing and fulfilling orders. Amazon has been a godsend to many small businesses."
PS4,fqeny45,t3_gif4sm,1589310706.0,"I don't think every game needs a sequel. I would prefer Bend to explore creative possibilities and maybe try something new. Days Gone is good, but it isn't great."
PS4,fqcmlr1,t3_gi3jdo,1589262322.0,"You can only stream PS4 games to the Vita. The Vita isn't powerful enough to play PS4 games natively. The Vita has a decent library though, so if you can get a good deal I would recommend it."
xboxone,fqb8b0q,t1_fqaasfg,1589232337.0,"It may not be an announcement for a new Mafia at all. It's probably an announcement for remasters of Mafia 2 and a GOTY Mafia 3, which sucks."
PS4,fq8h80i,t1_fq83dhx,1589166130.0,Poor guy. He will have to change his username soon.
PS4,fq8gbps,t3_ghf852,1589165555.0,Yes
Coronavirus,fq6momf,t3_gh53vr,1589134489.0,LeBron won't be too happy about this lol. He only has a few good seasons left to get another ring.
Coronavirus,fq6lpv7,t1_fq6il38,1589133947.0,"It's not about turning a profit anymore. These businesses need to reopen in a hope to just stay a float. If I am a small business owner and everything I have is tied into my business I would open. As far as the employees go, if they aren't comfortable coming back they should be able to get a leave of absence."
xboxone,fq6hb3p,t1_fq6h4jq,1589131517.0,I agree. There is no way they will have a game of that scope to show.
xboxone,fq6cj6f,t1_fq657c4,1589128881.0,"I agree with everything that you said, other than the Initiative. I do have a feeling that we will get a short teaser for Perfect Dark. Its still potentially a year or two away because they haven't been around long enough."
xboxone,fq6c424,t1_fq5jal1,1589128651.0,"I wouldn't expect a lot of titles to be AAA. Microsoft will probably mix in smaller games to fill out Game Pass in between AAA titles. Who knows if Compulsion, Inxile, Double Fine, or Undead are even capable of making AAA quality games."
xboxone,fq6birp,t1_fq5t029,1589128326.0,"I heard differently. Supposedly, this previous showcase was overflow from what was supposed to be the E3 showcase. The bigger 3rd party partnerships may also be apart of the July showcase."
xboxone,fq6b2uc,t3_ggz7d5,1589128084.0,"There is no way most of this stuff is revealed. A lot of these studios were acquired just to be support for the bigger studios. Also, games like Gears 6 and the Obsidian RPG are still in early development/concept. I bet we get a few title cards for the Fable RPG and some gameplay from Halo and Forza. We may also get some Wasteland dlc because that will be releasing in September."
xboxone,fq6aggt,t3_gh2ued,1589127741.0,Hopefully it's Mafia 4 and not the GOTY edition that is coming out.
xboxone,fq6a5oc,t1_fq62h25,1589127572.0,The Silent Hill devs aren't involved. Only the composer of the games is. This is the developer of Blair Witch and The Observer game.
PS4,fpy6gjd,t1_fpwyw18,1588997043.0,Bioshock Infinite is a AAA game and is one of the best looking games of last gen. What are you even talking about? Lol
PS4,fpy6akl,t1_fpw3ucq,1588996936.0,"The first game didn't look great either and it was awesome. The environments look great and the character models look sub par. The writing is what it important and the characters. If this is anything like the first game, it will be great."
patientgamers,fpucw2u,t3_gfac2u,1588909837.0,"I disagree on a couple points. Many people criticize Sony for not developing games, and instead developing stories. The Last of Us is like 90% gameplay and the rest cut scenes. The cutscenes are a way to get people invested in the gameplay loop. Having said that, I understand that the game isn't for everyone. I didn't truly fall in love with the game until it was over."
xboxone,fpuca4k,t1_fpua4yl,1588909440.0,"These aren't exclusives. I mean they may be their party exclusive, but these aren't Xbox studios."
PS4,fptto1f,t1_fpthxtj,1588898045.0,"Just because we haven't seen a straight gameplay demo doesn't mean there isn't a reason to be hyped. The game is absolutely beautiful, the world is cool, and the story seems to be really interesting. I'm not exactly sure what the combat will be like, but I am willing to bet that it will at least be good."
Coronavirus,fpspzpu,t3_gfcmqc,1588877647.0,"Even if cannabis cured COVID-19, the federal government(United States) STILL wouldn't legalize it lol."
assassinscreed,fpseybk,t1_fps22pi,1588872334.0,"You're right, but come on man. Ubisoft knows damn well that what they showed wasn't the ""gameplay"" people wanted. I have no more information on this game than I had last week."
xboxone,fpsee1a,t3_gfa1vq,1588872061.0,Something tells me this is more a tech demo. One developer won't be able to make a full length AAA quality game.
xboxone,fpse60a,t3_gfagqb,1588871953.0,Any release date on this?
xboxone,fps239q,t1_fprr4qu,1588866180.0,"No, that's not what I meant at all. All I was saying is that I still think The Last of Us will be an awesome game. Dying Light 2 will probably be good as well."
xboxone,fpqpwrc,t1_fppjhje,1588828886.0,That not a good comparison lol. The last of us 2 is still worth getting.
xboxone,fpqoy5m,t1_fppt2tp,1588828138.0,The problem for me is that it was kind of boring. The areas to explore in the Mako were empty and the combat wasn't good. I would have preferred the linear adventure.
xboxone,fpqoqlk,t1_fpqoajj,1588827978.0,I mean it's only a remaster. I wouldn't be surprised if they update the resolution and frame rate and call it a day.
xboxone,fpqocxw,t1_fpptnef,1588827695.0,I would love a very detailed handcrafted historical city for the next game. Odyssey was too big for its own good.
thelastofus,fpqk96y,t1_fpoa063,1588824769.0,"It will look amazing. Have you play Uncharted 4? If it looks even a little bit better, it will arguably be the best looking game this gen."
thelastofus,fpqjqu6,t1_fpo7vl0,1588824417.0,"I don't know, people act like children. There is no there way to say it. The leaks are definitely controversial, but people should wait until the game releases first before complaining. Stories are meant to be written in arcs, meaning you really need to have the whole story before making judgements. It goes back to the saying that if you steal you're a bad person. Sure, if there is no context that may be true, but is the person that is stealing to feed their family a bad person? Sorry for the long winded post, just wanted to get that out there."
thelastofus,fpqj89p,t1_fpqfgf8,1588824065.0,Exactly. TLOU is similar to the first seasons of the Walking Dead in that unexpected things happen. People make dumb decisions and lives are lost. TLOU2 shouldn't be a happy reunion and I may even argue that it shouldn't have a happy ending.
PS4,fpowvx5,t1_fpospkp,1588792049.0,Lol There isn't an exact science to that. We won't be able to truly judge the game until we have seen the story play out. There are things called story arcs and character arcs that need time to play out.
PS4,fpowdu5,t1_fpo7cqv,1588791803.0,"My Pro is quiet, so I really can't really relate to others."
PS4,fpowa7v,t3_gekjd4,1588791753.0,"Say what you want, but that trailer was fantastic! I'm still incredibly hyped for this game."
xboxone,fposih4,t1_fpohl33,1588789907.0,They said it is coming out this gen a couple minutes ago.
xboxone,fpos4q0,t3_gemtzh,1588789720.0,"This article is supposedly ""innacurate"". Having said that, it wouldn't surprise me if this is the case. The game was originally slated for 2019 and then got pushed to 2020 and now who knows. This game will not be what was advertised."
xboxone,fpmnyq0,t1_fpmbpeu,1588737337.0,Ok
xboxone,fpj78nw,t1_fpi2cp1,1588658668.0,"This may sound kind of selfish but that sucks. How many games need to be abandoned for Anthem? The game may eventually be decent, but it will never be great."
xboxone,fpj73lp,t1_fpherfw,1588658545.0,Please no more Andromeda. They need to get as far away from that game as possible and maybe try another spin off.
xboxone,fpj6v5f,t1_fphbqu6,1588658341.0,"FF7 is awesome though, best game this year so far."
xboxone,fpj6k1b,t1_fphrk5n,1588658073.0,Probably not. EA doesn't put their games on game pass. I am crossing my fingers that it comes to EA Access soon.
PS4,fpj1qrc,t1_fpia5yl,1588654188.0,The actual leaks are accurate and no one is debating that. The only thing that isn't completely accurate is how people are making assumptions of the complete game without having played or watched it. It's like watching the final scenes in The Lord of the Rings and trying to understand the whole picture based off of the scene where Frodo destroys the ring.
PS4,fpiwlpz,t1_fpiaqok,1588650437.0,"Let's just slow our roll here. We don't know what TLOU 2 will or will not do right. Maybe you're right and it will turn into a disaster. However, there is an equally likely chance that it will be one of the better games to have come out in the last couple years. I also agree the Last Jedi is trash. Naughty Dog actually has the best writers in their industry so I highly doubt they compare."
ghostoftsushima,fpfb3rn,t1_fpen3za,1588566224.0,"Exactly. Also, what do you think people are going to say on this subreddit? Lol"
ghostoftsushima,fpfavxw,t3_gcyeef,1588566067.0,"I'm sure it will be fine, stop worrying.  Sucker Punch has play tested the game and know what they are doing. Should every game assume that the player is a moron that can't figure out simple directions?"
ghostoftsushima,fpfap1j,t3_gcytdx,1588565926.0,"You're going to end up disappointed. I'm not saying this won't be a great game, but it certainly won't be perfect and it will definitely have flaws. Not to mention games like Cyberpunk and TLOU do exist and may very well being better."
ghostoftsushima,fpfa7ec,t1_fpdneqm,1588565569.0,I mean if there are signs and variety in the environments and structures it shouldn't be that hard. People are making a big issue out of something that will ultimately be mild. I'm sure there were plenty of play testers that made sure it is doable.
PS4,fpf9oe0,t3_gd1kqq,1588565185.0,I wouldn't. I recently sold a nice condition console for 150 on eBay. You can definitely do better than 180 for a potentially damaged system.
PS4,fpf98br,t3_gcw7qm,1588564867.0,"RDR2 is the superior game by far. Its world is life like and it isn't just copy pasted assets. The story and characters are also much better written in RDR2. Having said all of this, there are a fair amount of people that prefer AC because it plays more like an RPG and the combat is arguably better. RDR2 is the most detailed game I have ever seen though, so it is worth a playthrough just to admire the world and art."
assassinscreed,fpbvuwh,t3_gcf7nv,1588480078.0,"Ubisoft is a large company and they cycle developers, kind of like Activision does with Call of Duty. On average, each Assassin's Creed game is like 3 years."
PS4,fp7538h,t3_gboob4,1588364204.0,"First rule of thumb, reviews tend to based on taste. For example, I enjoyed Exodus, despite the issues. I personally didn't find the issues that much of a hindrance because I have played the previous games and enjoyed them. There were also many reviewers that pointed out the issues, so you really need to watch more than one review."
PS4,fp6m7vd,t1_fp6ivka,1588354744.0,"I mean most people aren't well versed in copyright etiquette. I agree it is wrong, but if you don't want it to happen you need to take precautions. The upside to this is that his/her artwork has been shared with thousands of people."
PS4,fp6lq7e,t3_gbkjap,1588354503.0,"There is that rumor that Tony Hawk is working with developers on a new game. Unfortunately, if it's anything like the last one I am out."
PS4,fp6lcn5,t1_fp6jl0q,1588354316.0,"It's hard for Sony to quantify it though. I wonder if Sony will sue for damages, not that it will amount to anything."
cyberpunkgame,fp51tsv,t1_fp1rfhw,1588313616.0,Supposedly 76 was mostly developed by their support studio in Austin. Bethesda Maryland has probably been developing Starfield since 2015. Of course they probably helped on the mess that is 76 occasionally.
cyberpunkgame,fp51jic,t1_fozmhj8,1588313367.0,"We may not even get anything this year. Bethesda has cancelled their digital showcase. Im guessing we probably get it sometime in 2021, but I was kind of hoping this year we would at least get a cinematic trailer."
PS4,fp4v1e2,t3_gbbkeb,1588308121.0,"If that is the case, the developer was never entitled to the bonus early(a bonus potentially based off of sales). It's not for me to say if Naughty Dog was in the right or not because we don't know exactly what happened. The developer also screwed himself and will probably be blacklisted from ever getting another job in the industry. He is an idiot and handled it in the worst possible way."
Coronavirus,fp44jmc,t1_fp43yh2,1588291542.0,No doubt. But lucky old me and many of the people in my state are sitting here after a month with no unemployment money. We were laid off as a result of government action.
xboxone,fp3n9t8,t1_fp3kgdd,1588282314.0,"I don't have a windows partition on my Mac yet and I hate playing on my computer anyway. Eventually, I'll try it out when I have the time though."
xboxone,fp3biqa,t3_gay0yj,1588276432.0,"A lot of this is just marketing speak. Ubisoft always over sells their games, only for them to end up generic and mediocre. I am intrigued by this game, but I was also excited for Odyssey and I ended up being extremely underwhelmed with what it offered."
xboxone,fp3abar,t1_fp27xay,1588275834.0,You see I would if I actually had a PC lol. I have a Mac so that's a no go for me and many other people.

xboxone,fp0yv46,t3_gal9ps,1588220083.0,Max Payne 3 needs a port or it needs to be remastered. It sucks that such a big game is unplayable on Xbox One.
Coronavirus,fp03weu,t1_fozol1w,1588202005.0,What's the alternative? Millions of people have been laid off through no fault of their own and because of government shutdowns. I'm sure most people would prefer to be working right now instead of worrying about their potential lack of job prospects.
Coronavirus,fp03hes,t1_fozg0zb,1588201785.0,"Pretty much same situation with me. By the time I see any government money, I may already be out of housing and food. Not to mention, when this is over I doubt I will be able to find a decent job for a while."

PS4,fox8tzd,t1_fowyihy,1588136996.0,"No, definitely not. If you want a good star wars campaign try Jedi Fallen Order."
Games,fowh1o0,t1_fortnh5,1588119623.0,"Yep, pretty much. It's kind of annoying seeing a lot of gamers acting like children over a few plot points. I honestly think the game will end up being good regardless and people will end up buying it as a result. People need to chill out and stop losing their minds over some spoilers that have been taken out of context."
PS4,fowghwm,t1_fov9sk7,1588119318.0,"How is it free money? The RE remakes and Final Fantasy 7 remake probably cost just as much as any other AAA game. Also, these remakes really are new games. They have completely different gameplay systems, assets, graphics and even story elements."
PS4,fovc1ng,t3_g9lpz5,1588098804.0,"There is no way they will stretch this game out over more than four parts. From a publisher and developer stand point it would be a logistical nightmare. No developer wants to be saddled with the same game for decades, so I definitely think it will still be in a three or four game range."
PS4,fovap9q,t3_g9sbi1,1588098169.0,"They don't lol. Resident Evil has 3 remakes, and one of them is 20 years old. Final Fantasy has a grand total of one remake. I don't really see the issue with remaking old games with new technology and graphics."
ghostoftsushima,fotg90z,t1_fos9ibf,1588053038.0,"You can wait if you want, but the gameplay and the art style will remain the same. Sure, the game will probably look great on the PS5, but it's going to look good on the PS4 Pro as well. Not to mention, the PS5 will be expensive and limited supply on launch."
ghostoftsushima,fote3k2,t1_for41gz,1588051286.0,"Knowing one piece of information doesn't define the story dude. There are hours of context and gameplay in between that point. I could care less if you buy the game or not, but try and show a little more intellect."
ghostoftsushima,fotdnvt,t3_g93ncd,1588050943.0,I'm excited for both so it's not a big deal for me. It's really only a short delay anyway and I am happy we finally got a definite release date for both games.
PS4,fopfd8r,t1_fopbnwt,1587960065.0,They are though lol...
PS4,fopf8i5,t3_g8rsoo,1587959972.0,Thanks!
Coronavirus,foo7eni,t1_fonw1hp,1587933956.0,That website is crap. It doesn't work for me at least.
rockstar,foo49l1,t3_g7twrd,1587932204.0,They made five games. You forgot about Max Payne 3. I think the issue is that Rockstar is content with drip feeding content into Red Dead Online and GTA Online for a fraction of the price of making a brand new game.
thelastofus,foo052m,t1_folvxa8,1587929896.0,I think the issues is that people will end up forgoing buying the physical disk after they beat the rental. Not to mention the logistics behind doing something like that would be extremely difficult.
