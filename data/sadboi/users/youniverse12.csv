My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer stage IV and he refused to get in any kind of treatment and instead, just strictly converted his diet into juicing, following Gersons Therapy instructions for about 4 months (he has had a very healthy diet for a few years and is vegetarian, only eating animal protein in special occasions) and he improved his condition with time.. about 6 months after he was cancer free. I think our life style can really affect our health."

I don't want to try a different one, just learn how to live and manage this. Hopefully, now with all the knowledge I have and being aware of my diagnosis, is going to be a lot different. Because, before I was unaware and everything was chaos and I thought it was just who I was."

I hope it works well for you!"
bipolar2,f6h58i9,t1_f6ec3iy,1572837329.0,I would follow the directions in the bottle. The supplement I'm taking suggests to take one capsule a day or as directed by a doctor 🤷🏻‍♀️
bipolar2,f6a2j57,t3_dqq2rd,1572751087.0,"I was on lamictal for about 4-5 months. It worked great for me, but I noticed my hair started falling out a lot more than it ever did. I have a lot of hair and it's very thick, I can tell it has less volume now and hair bands are kind of lose.. once I completely stopped taking it I could tell my hair stopped falling out as much.

I was really scared it would get worse! I would recommend maybe taking supplement of biotin, which helps with the health of your hair, nails and skin.

I went up to 100mg, I was supposed to get to 150mg, but I was so nervous about it I never did."

I was having an awesome time and then lost it when saw her trying to go for my husband lol. And when I say ""lost it"", I mean LOST IT.

It took me a while to get over it, but now we look back and laugh about it. 

Never saw that girl again lol."

Good job!! You CAN do this! WE CAN! ♥️"
AmItheAsshole,f40eo73,t3_dizqin,1571296388.0,"Well, I think you all need to calm down a little bit and step back -_-

First of all, I am so sorry for your loss... <3

Now, with the kids are 2 and 4, they are not going to remember any of these details. Neither they are going to be traumatized by this, unless of course they continue the story this way.

Mom (SIL) is obviously having a hard time coping and trying to figure out how to explain DEATH to two TODDLERS. Have any of you thought about how difficult that could be? I have a 2yo and a almost 4yo, which I can't imagine having to explain to them their dad passed. Like, how??  

Anyway, you are absolutely right on waiting on her to handle that talk (she shouldn't wait too long though), those are her kids and her husband who passed. She is the best one and should be the one giving that talk to her kids.

I also agree with someone who mentioned you should correct them when they call you dada, and say who you really are. It's a good way for them to realize daddy hasn't been coming home, and maybe it will help push your SIL into explaining her kids.

You could also talk to her about your concerns and offer support for the talk.

This is a very complex situation. I am sorry you have to deal with this on top of the loss."
bipolar2,f40cqfo,t3_dj1iig,1571293926.0,"Just like they said, if you didn't love your son you wouldn't care at all. Which, you do. You are heartbroken by the way you feel and you reached out to your mom so she can nurture him.

You are a great mom :)

Postpartum depression sucks, but goes away eventually.

Are you doing anything to take care of yourself? It's important you do. Balance diet, lots of water, stretching, meditation, music, silly dancing, take walks with the little one.. All those type of things should help.

I hope you feel better! Newborns are so precious and grow out so fast. Try to enjoy it before it's gone! (The newborn phase).

You got this! <3"
bipolar,f3wk96d,t3_dihwcv,1571206015.0,"I would love to do that, but the only reason I don't is because thanks to the corruption in my homeland my family (and millions more) have migrated all over the world and that's the only way we really stay in touch and are able to watch our kids grow 😭"

bipolar,f3qpe5x,t1_f3qckb2,1571078585.0,"I didn't mean to sound like an ass. I was referring about myself, I don't have self control with alcohol. If I have a drink I'll keep getting more and more. So, I've decided to do myself and others a favor and stay away from it.

Also, when I have a couple of drinks now it gives me a headache because of the meds. I guess that helps me keep it away lol.

I'm sorry if my comment was misleading though! I sure didn't mean it."
