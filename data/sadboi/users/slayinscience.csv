How can you force a woman to carry a baby to term? That in itself is life altering AND life threatening. Complications in pregnancy, ectopic pregnancies, child birth, etc. Are all potentially life threatening. The law has no place in a woman's body autonomy. 

A baby/fetus inside a woman is STILL APART of her body. Without the woman, the fetus wouldn't exist. By your logic/ ideal laws, youd rather a woman smoke/drink her baby to death (and probably herself) than give her the option of termination. That's just fucked up. 

Because, let's be real-- abortions are still gonna happen. Women are still going to be put in positions where they can't/won't deliver a child to term (rape, incest, financial situations, family expectations, societal pressures, health issues, etc).

2. She doesn't want to date you atm. She may have at one point, but she's allowed to change her mind. 
3. It's best for both parties to honor the 'no contact'. If you keep trying, you'll simply damage what may be left of a potential friendship (which, I guess you're not interested in)."

Ultimately, it would be her choice if she wanted to keep the child (because you can't force a woman to abort), but on the same hand, she can't force you to stay. You can offer to pay child support, be apart of the kids life, whatever. But if you're not happy with this woman, you need to leave. Misery only begets more misery. Meaning, if y'all are unhappy together then your child (if it's carried full term) will be unhappy."
