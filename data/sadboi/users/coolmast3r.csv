I got my first job when I was 24 and in the thick of bad post graduate depression. This job was provided to me on a silver platter and I'm thankful for that since I would have not been able to apply for it myself. It was a really simple assisting job at an office and after the novelty of having a job and earning your own money had worn off after like 2 weeks I really started hating it. And when you hate your job, this attitude really doesnt help your relationships with coworkers, so I became this quiet weird dude who just sat in their workplace all day and didnt speak to people even at a lunchbreak.  Being a loser without any useful skills at 24 (now 25) and neither having energy for acquiring them nor not being able to determine what skills I want to learn makes you feel totally useless as a person. I want to change, but I don't know what is even worth doing considering I'm so mentally and physically tired of being useless.

So yeah, ""just get a job"" is a really bad advice and people who give it clearly cant even grasp whats it like to be a person who is really depressed and existentially exhausted."

Hope dies last. There is a very good reason behind this saying. It reinforces the concept of hope and makes people believe that until they physically disappear from the face of the Earth there is a myriad of opportunities to capture. Seeing how predatory the economy is designed to be in some countries hope becomes a very useful tool to keep people ""trying to make it work"" while the majority of financial and other benefits go into pockets of very few. Honestly, hope is such a scary thing. No matter how shitty my life is and no matter how grim my personal future might seem, I simply can't get rid if that tiny speck of hope that tell me ""there is a chance"". And I agree, mathematically almost everyone has a chance to make it. The only question is - where can I find this chance to begin with? Yeah, you ""keep looking for it"".

depression,fgis3q6,t3_eypfa2,1580829674.0,"Okay. So there is a couple of things I want to tell you, things that I've learned shamefully only when I got into my twenties (I'm 24 as well).

First is that (to my knowledge and in my personal experience) there is a night and day difference between making friends when you are a kid or a teenager and making friends when you are in your twenties. When I was a kid, friendships seemed so effortless and natural because for the most part these friendships were very unconditional. I and my other couple of friends would go for walks, visit each other and just would do stuff just because it was fun and we were excited for fun. This kept our friendship healthy and active. But after we all finished school and our ""adult"" life began, suddenly we all found ourselves short on time and energy (or at the very least that's how I felt) - university took a large chunk of our time away and generally we started to feel like we are not kids anymore and certain, more adult-like behavior is now expected of us. This means that now we really needed to prioritize our time in a day + at least my friends all started long lasting relationships which also takes up huge amount of ones time. So at that point we kinda stopped seeing each other. It was kinda weird actually. Like we all suddenly realized that in order to survive and prosper in life we really need to only give time to the things that would help us grow.

And here is the second thing, which naturally follows the my first point - most relatively successful adults due to shortage of time want around them for the most part only those people who can actually provide some value to their life. In other words, they want to be friends with people who can help make this friendship fulfilling, exciting again and a person who doesn't have any goals, and means of supporting this friendship simply doesnt qualify as a worthy potential companion/friend.

Maybe I am wrong though, but this is what I can take away from my 24 years of observation and self reflection."
depression,fen126r,t3_epzjky,1579274588.0,"I believe we as human beings need to have an actual tangible, and what is more important, a MAJOR goal in our lives. If we dont have one we suffer badly because life without a goal is not a life, its just a mere existence IMO. I for one never had such a goal in my life as much as it sucks to admit this. Im almost 25 and Im in a really bad place in this regard. Thats because having a major goal means having a strong drive towards achieving it and having a strong drive means you're in a state of motivation that feels very natural and not forced. What I mean by this is that just like yourself, I tried to keep on the path on constant self improvement myself, but in my case I lacked a goal that would fuel my self improvement struggle so this endeavor ended as soon as I started feeling Im not going anywhere with that.

If you really want to find out what is wrong with you, start asking yourself one question - why? Why do I do this, why do I do that. Cause doing things like eating better, working out, reading books, socializing etc by definition are meaningful to your life as a whole only if they each provide a spark of meaning/purpose for a greater thing that is your life/your life's goal. I think we shouldnt be afraid to set bold and inspiring goals for ourselves. Developing a technology, eradicating a desease, writing beautiful songs that make you and everyone else happy... whatever it may be. As for me, Im pretty sure its unlikely that I'll ever come up with such an goal for myself but nevertheless its so dificult for me to accept that that theres not a single speck of hope left for me. So I keep on going."
depression,fdwcv21,t1_fdul629,1578757447.0,Why is that though?

depression,f9n93y3,t1_f9n76mk,1575479648.0,"I mean... I do enjoy a number of things (even if they are basic af) like tasty foods, going for walks, running, going to a gym (although it's been years since last time I've been there), good music.

I've never really been a creative type though. The most creative things I've done was building stuff out of legos or other stuff like paper when I was a kid. You know, when you're so deep in this seemingly neverending state of not knowing what to do with your life and all this while having really almost zero energy for anyhting other than meeting basic needs like eating, hygiene and sleep, creative thinking is not really a thing, for me at least.

As to your studies - it's tough to give advice since I don't know your situation, but I guess the most important thing is understanding WHY you are studying. If you can picture yourself at a job related to your degree and doing that job without hating it after graduating then you are perfectly fine. If you can afford a therapy you should absolutely try it, just try to find out how to find a good therapist first before spending your money.

Best of luck to you too, buddy."
depression,f9n21dd,t1_f9mwt3a,1575475288.0,"You are losing interest in those things because as you get older you start to realize that depression stems from an internal conflict between your desires and a lack of means of supporting yourself financially without hating what you do. It sounds so simple because it is a really simple concept. It's just that some people (you and I for example) for a number of reasons find it extremely difficult to resolve this conflict.

I myself have been struggling with this conflict for many many years (I am 25) and still am. Never had any idea of what I enjoyed doing to the point of turning it into a career. So when time came to choose my educational path I didn't know what to choose so I randomly chose a 6 year course that allowed me to get both bachelors and masters degrees for free (since I didn't know what I wanted out of education, paying for it would be insanely stupid). Well, when I finally got these degrees (which are close to useless by the way) I realized that I'd hit a wall and have no idea what to do next. Then I tried working a basic office job unrelated to my education and it sucked badly so I quit after a couple of months. And that's where I am now - without a job or education that I care for that I could use to start my career and eventually become independent.

These days I almost exclusively sit at home doing nothing productive because I can't picture any career path that I'd want to pursue to the point of actually getting off my ass and doing something. I even tried doing the no fap thing for 6 months (I'm still going) in hopes that maybe without all that dopamine from porn and masturbation my brain would go into full on survival mode and start coming up with solutions. But no, now I just have less energy than ever before, I nap twice a day sometimes just to keep myself from feeling like complete shit. It's cold outside, it's raining and snowing, and even at home I feel uncomfortable. So I sit at home with nothing but a PC with an internet access. It's so bad.

Also, I'm not sure about any of the battery info apps showing accurate readings on capacity/charge cycles, so I personally would advise getting any file manager that supports browsing the root folder and then using it to open the two text files that contain actual capacity and charge cycle info. Just google ""check battery capacity File manager root folder"" or something alonh those lines.

depression,eyjhrek,t3_cx6uiq,1567119445.0,"You want a 100% honest answer to your question?

It is hard to be happy (living a socially, intellectually, professionally etc. fulfilling life) simply because becoming happy relies exclusively on the neurological ""quality"" of your brain. Your brain is essentially a computer that has a set task of becoming happy (achieving some degree of success in various parts of life), but the problem is that everyones brain is physically different just like various computer processors are different (think mobile phone CPUs, home computer CPUs, supercomputers' CPUs) and therefore everyones brains have different levels of ""performance"". One person has such a brain that it doesn't take that much effort to excel at certain tasks but for another person doing the same thing may seem impossible.

This is literally it. There's nothing magical about it - if you are struggling with achieving things in life on a path of becoming happy, your brain is just very inefficient at doing so.

It only later in the evening that I have some energy to do something that requires moving at all. So I usually go for a walk. This helps at least feel that I did something nice for myself in a day. Cause apart from that, I dont do anything productive at all. So yeah, I get you. Depression sucks everything out of you and leaves you in sort of a vegetative state. You become a lifeless plant and often its so fucking bad that unless you really feel the need - you just dont do anyhting productive."
depression,esbqb31,t3_c6usii,1561806478.0,"I suppose you mean you at least actively try doing things. I, on the contrary, just passively exist without trying, so not only do I not work towards having things that would potentially make me a bit happier, I also have this deep feeling of guilt for being so passive and ready to die."

depression,es12i67,t1_es0zza2,1561487862.0,"Really? Thank you very much! Getting compliments is such an extremely rare thing for me, I honestly cant even remember the last time I got one, provided yours is a genuine one (which I believe it is). I doubt I would make a good writer but I certainly had a thought of writing a book on my personal life and struggles (but I guess almost every depressed person at some point at least once thought of doing it as an outlet for all of the unexpressed feelings). Anyway, you made me smile, for which Im thankful :)"

depression,es072jr,t1_es058wr,1561467691.0,"I think PixelRain means he at least wants to see what an independent, sort of ""base line"" life as an adult is like before deciding for good whether its worth living or not. Cause surprisingly it seems for some people being a wage slave and exhausted doesnt bother them to the point of daily suicidal ideation.
If it bothers you, well, theres a high chance this feeling wont go away (I tried working a minimum wage job for a couple of months. Never again. I wound rather die should my parents stop being able to support my basic needs)."
depression,es06lr6,t1_es05q68,1561467294.0,That last sentence of yours - absolute truth. Survival of the fittest means losers get what they deserve. Its as freakin sad as it is true.
depression,erzwx9d,t1_erzhbd6,1561456102.0,Even if god were real I would still happily burn in hell because living in a world in which said god allows for *SO MUCH* suffering is unimaginably worse than burning in hell.
depression,erzwlke,t1_erzvb1u,1561455598.0,"I agree. This concept of ""being grateful"" for parents bringing you into this ""magical, wonderful world"" is beyond insane. Yes, this world can be a worderful and even magical place... only there's this LITTLE FUCKING CATCH - you have to be a successful person first to have the highest chance possible of properly teaching your kid how to be successful just like yourself! If you're not successful and still decide to have kids, congrats - there's a high chance they'll end up being fucking losers! Isn't it worderful!?"
depression,erzwbof,t3_c55ee2,1561455165.0,"This exact though comes to my mind on a daily basis, multiple times even. What is even worse though is when parents don't even fucking know how to teach their children stuff about living in this world/society. My mom and dad have never taught me anything in regards to career paths, education, relationships, friendships etc. That is why despite me being 24 I still look like I'm 17 year old, act like a 17yo and suffer from crippling inability to initiate any interactions with anyone. I'm still alive only because I fear pain, and because I'm in a position where there is still some tiny bit of hope for me I guess. But it doesn't change the fact that I sit at home without a job or friends (I dont even talk about girlfriend), do not study anything cause I'm tired all the time and generally feel like shit. Oh and I also happen to be short and I'm not particularly handsome in the face departmant. Nice. Fucking amazing. Thanks everyone involved."
depression,erjp6sh,t3_c2ep6l,1560941438.0,"Fuck. I'm so sorry man, even considering I have never been loved in my life by anyone and I can't relate to the fullest, it still hurts so bad reading what you've written here. I try to imagine what would I do if somthing like this happened to me but it's so difficult. Yet, in a way I can relate. I'm not going to tell you having never been loved is worse than losing someone so significant, I think it is equally painful, so there's that. I, too, am in a great pain knowing a girl I would love to be with is now married and despite the fact that we were good acquaintances I'm pretty sure she'll never ever like me as much as I like her. This drains me to no end and at this point (I'm 24) I feel like I'll never be loved by anyone... It's so fucked. Like a freaking mirror maze that you cant find a way out of. I dont do anything stupid only because of my parents..."
depression,erd1afe,t3_c1bqf8,1560727919.0,"How do you even start crawling out of this rut though? Being a loser essentially means that you've lost. Lost at a game of life. Either by not learning the rules of the game or by knowingly ignoring them or by being unfit for the game in the first place.

I'm the same as you man. The most social thing I can do is just go outside and walk around the city, never interacting or initiating small talk with anyone wharsoever. Since I dont attend a uni or have job, this means Im stupidly starved of human contact. But being extremely weakened by my loserness mentally and physically, I just cant find energy to actively seek that contact. Thats what being a real loser is like."
pcmasterrace,er8pyt0,t3_c0xavz,1560609537.0,"I have this exact one in my pc as well. Nice card, although whines like a motherfucker if not undervolted."
depression,er4r4nb,t3_c0h3wd,1560505964.0,"Alright. First off, thanks for sharing your thoughts.

I want to preface what I'm about to say with a notion that I *really* relate to what you've written so there's that.

Okay. Here wo go. I'm not going to tell you ""to just get some confidence"" or some vague crap like that because lets be honest here and (considering you seem to be very self-conscious on this matter, I'm going to be *really honest* here) if you feel worthless - you *are* worthless. A person who has a healthy, working, well-developed brain will never feel worthless as not only do they feel needed by a humanity because they are aware of the intellectual potential they have, they also *are able to translate that feeling of being needed into something tangible, whatever it may be* (a book, a business, a car design, a song etc.). I know, it's sounds brutal, but that's because *reality is brutal*. Make one mistake (a couple deciding to have a kid when they both are not very intellingent or have enough resources to properly raise them, a teenager not having a good idea of what they are good at or destined to doing, etc.) and *a whole life might be ruined just like that*.

You see where I'm going with this. And I know a lot of people come to this sub to vent or share their thoughts and they are not ready for this realisation. But it's the most important thing you can do to at least acknowledge your situation. As for me, I've never been fond of studying and reading books, most of my teenage years I've spent playing with toys (videogames and such). Now I'm 24 and I know I've wasted the crucial years of my life. So I, just like you, often think of ending my life because I can't imagine my life in even a couple of years down the road. But I'm not going to do it for a couple of reasons. First being that I just can't do this to my parents. They clearly suffer and are deeply depressed too looking at me and how I'm not going anywhere. Killing myself would break them and I can't allow this to happen, it's just too much. Second being that I still believe that there is a chance for me in this life. However small it may be, having this chance of getting better and doing something good for this world beats having *zero* chances at all.

So there you go."
PS5,eoau80x,t3_br54x9,1558428042.0,"I know it's really tempting to jump to the conclusion tha PS5 will have total backwards compatiblility with all previous console generations (that would be *the* killer feature of PS5 for me personally) but all I'm seeing in this slide is a demonstration of the ways you were, can and will be able to get your games on each Playstation. Sadly I am not seeing any implications of a total backwards compatibility on this slide, but I REALLY hope it is a feature that Sony consideres important. Although to be completely honest, the every time I see only PS4 mentioned in these articles stating that ""backwards compatibility is a feature of critical importance to Sony"", my hope slowly withers away..."
