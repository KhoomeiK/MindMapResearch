selfimprovement,eqjksgm,t3_bykuz7,1560106644.0,"I absolutely love this! Over the moon for you, OP :D"
Agoraphobia,eq9bc8h,t3_bxs8ri,1559897805.0,"Yes I suffer from this exact feeling. If I walk into a busy store like Target or Walmart I completely shut down. Bright fluorescent lights, people talking, music playing, thousands of products in my face. I immediately get tunnel vision and start panicking and it usually ends in me going outside and asking my boyfriend or sister to purchase what I need. I feel like I’m a little hermit crab that’s been ripped out of their shell. Tiny, squishy and vulnerable."
depression,epd0ngv,t3_bue9q3,1559160637.0, I am deeply sorry for your loss. Just know that your mom is truly in a better place. She is no longer suffering and that is most important. Her pride and love for you are eternal. Be gentle with yourself and allow yourself to feel it all.
DecidingToBeBetter,ep7qqsr,t1_ep5akbx,1559085186.0,I love that CBT technique. I'm going to try it!
Anxiety,ep7hu70,t1_ep7b1qx,1559081996.0,"When you’re checking up on ex’s on social media, remember that everyone posts the highlights of their life only (which accounts for about 2%). Nobody posts about their low days, fights with their partner or struggles in general. In the past I’ve fallen down holes of wondering how the hell some people’s lives seem so perfect. The answer is that they’re not and social media can be extremely toxic if you’re not in a good place yourself."
dpdr,ep6oh2p,t3_btzvfa,1559071626.0," I was prescribed Fluoxetine at the end of March and I have had the same result. My depersonalization has lessened dramatically, but I still have the fear and avoidance stuck in my mind. I used to depersonalize before and during any driving I did, so I started avoiding driving on the interstate and began depending on my loved ones for long distance car journeys. Since I’ve started taking Fluoxtetine (my first SSRI) I have been giving myself little challenges to show myself that I am no longer depersonalizing behind the wheel and having a little bit of panic is okay and eventually it will go away. I have never been in a car accident and I can trust myself to get from A to B. Baby steps. Very happy to hear that you’re seeing positive results, OP! :)"
