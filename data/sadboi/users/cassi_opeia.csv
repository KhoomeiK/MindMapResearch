I would look at getting on hormones  ASAP as early termination of ovaries can cause a Multitude of life altering side effects including cognitive and psychological effects.

Find a new dr if your current one isn’t understanding and knowledgeable. We know so little and you’ve got to have a provider that is on your side!

I was a server and bartender prior to hygiene and so I know what “moving around” feels like and your definitely not “moving around”  in hygiene, maybe bits while exposing radiographs and instruments but the majority of your day is spent sitting in the same position hunched over patients... I also have cervical radiculopathy. From this bending over...

I wouldn’t let your age stop you but wrist issues are prominent.. if you decide to do it make sure you sign up for a supplemental disability policy ASAP after graduating just in case. 
Nursing might be a better career if you want to MOVE MOVE MOVE- and they also have different areas you can specialize in also moving up in the nursing world is possible... you could become a NP if you wanted. 
Hygiene is hygiene- unless you want to become a dentist and do more of the same back breaking work your stuck. Also business insider just named RDH as the most damaging job to your health.

hysterectomy,f2maoa3,t1_f2a3wq9,1570303614.0,"I’m so glad to hear you are stable. Hormone Instability is so scary. 
I believe that the amount of estrogen my body needs may be higher as well. 

Because I still have one ovary drs are reluctant to give me estrogen. Some say that my remaining ovary should take over but I have read studies that even with one ovary if I do not supplement my chances for dementia and Alzheimer’s go up and also life expectancy lowers by 7 years!! I tried for months with no supplement of estradiol and I was “walking the line” so to speak. Those were very dark days. 

As soon as I applied the patch within a couple of hours the dark cloud started lifting.

As for the pellet I was given only 10 mg of estradiol, and 125 mg of testosterone. It’s seems extraordinarily low compared to your 50mg...  I wonder if that’s why I still need the patch. Again I have one working ovary I just don’t know HOW sufficient the estrogen levels are from that ovary, apparently not very!! 

At this point in time my new obgyn (who did not give me the pellet or patch) wants me to phase off all hormones... she recommended a self help book with a mind over matter theme.
I’m all for natural solutions but not if they are endangering my life. I will have to wean SLOWLY.  

My HRT specialist says my levels are Normal as well but that doesn’t explain my low energy or motivation.. she tested my t3 free and it came back at a 2.8, she said ideally I would be at a 4-4.3... I feel hesitant about throwing ANOTHER hormone into the mix, But I just want to feel normal!! No more life is passing me by....i think I need to try new drs/specialists and find one that is on the same page as I am. 

Thank god for the HERS foundation."
hysterectomy,f2719uz,t1_f22sb13,1570028451.0,"Yes, it is tragic and an awakening to the state of our current health care system for us “unawares”. and it’s like you don’t KNOW, until you KNOW and then it’s too late.

My surgery was a year ago, the last year (up until a couple months ago when I was finally put estradiol)  has been one of the hardest years of my life, I literally contemplated where to tie a rope. I could not imagine any reason to live in such a state.
My obgyn and primary care would not put me on anything but birth control because my levels all appeared WNL
But I did not feel Within Normal limits, I finally saved up enough money to see an HRT specialist who gave me the patch and then the pellet, the patch immediately took away symptoms, the pellet obviously takes longer. 
It’s been 6 weeks and they want me to wean off the patch, every time I try my symptoms become nightmarish again. To the point I feel I should be in a rubber room somewhere. 

I know my hormones are still not “right” I just haven’t found the right dr to adjust, they are all scared because I am so young and my levels show fine, also, every hrt specialist  I see is another 450$ cash just for consult :( I am Back in school and working part time so I don’t have extra funds. 

Feel like I’m caught in the health system hamster wheel now. Im dependent on these hormones and it’s costing me...I have to stay on them just to stay alive.

I will definitely try to find a therapist, I think that’s a great idea! It’s just time and money, like I said now that I am in school. 

Thank you for your words of support and encouragement. I wish there was more to be done in legislation so this does not happen to unsuspecting victims!!

But I also think that depends on the office you are in, The help you get from assistants and the standards (quality of equipment cleanliness of patients) set by the dr you work for. 
 If you can live off of 3 days a week on hygiene income I think that would give you enough time for your side hustle... 
also school is more like 4 years.. 1.5-2 years of pre read and then 2 years of hygiene...
