Many of these places do not charge a delivery fee if you meet the minimum order, so you will be effectively paying the same price you would be in store.  

I‚Äôve actually found that you can get much lower prices by shopping around with delivery services.  They have much lower overhead costs and this can often result in serious savings compared with physical shops.  The only downside is you may be waiting 3 hours for your delivery! 

Also, shops in Santa Clara county are currently only open to medical patients.  If you‚Äôre recreational, you‚Äôll need to order delivery or drive north to SF, Hayward or Oakland."

Since you are using Intel Iris graphics, you will be unable to use Bootcampdrivers.com 

This is because BCD.com is designed for AMD graphics card, and therefore none of the drivers will work with your intel card.

Also, re-booting and switching to/from Bootcamp is not difficult or a hassle.  You can choose which OS you want to be your main booting OS, so that it will always boot into the OS of your choice.  While the computer is starting up, you can hold Alt to bring up the OS selection menu. It‚Äôs really simple!"
