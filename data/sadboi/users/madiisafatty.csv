I feel so out of control when this happens, the anger comes out of the blue. You’re not alone. I’m currently seeking help to help me with managing my anger better, but truly it’s all a matter of creating an awareness between the mind and body. Which is truly, hard to do. But I have hope!"

I have these pictures that flash in my brain of a dead deer, being gutted. I can’t make sense of this either. Thank you for sharing this with me."

It starts off talking about veterans, but that is because that is how the psychologist first started to learn about trauma.  It is called The Body Keeps Score by Bessel van der Kolk."
