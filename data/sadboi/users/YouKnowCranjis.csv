AskReddit,fhi09cc,t1_fhhb33z,1581615261.0,">It can be humiliating to think back on the person you were once you get a clear head and feel like you finally have control of yourself. When you’re depressed you are half a person - all your energy is wasted trying to keep it together, so decision making, holding your emotions, controlling your impulses, and general self awareness is totally diminished. When you finally get out of it you look back and think, “I can’t believe that was me, I can’t believe I did those things,”

Oh man, you nailed this point. I've been struggling with shameful decisions recently and I try to remind myself that all we can do is learn from these things and move on to become more wise versions of ourselves."
AskReddit,fhhzfbp,t3_f34at3,1581614784.0,"Exercise. It doesn't even have to be much at first! It could be just 10 minutes on the bicycle or 10 pushups here and there, but I found that dedication to it and building it into my routine has done wonders for my mental health in the long-term.  

I don't want you to think that it is an easy/quick solution, because those don't exist when dealing with mental illness. However, I found that in my experience, the best thing you can do for yourself is to find motivation to do something productive.  If you can't feel the motivation, forcing yourself into an activity because it is built into your routine is the next best thing.  Having that consistency is absolutely key.

Having exercise built into my daily routine for months, if not years now, has given me a solid base to which I can always return to, no matter how bad of a day I had.  When I get home from work and spend 30 minutes lifting weights or riding my bike, nothing else bothers me.  I am focused on the task at hand and accomplishing my goal for the workout session.  Being present in that task and overcoming something that is physical and challenging is exhausting. But over time, and with consistent practice, it is immensely rewarding. That feeling of accomplishment builds on itself, which builds confidence, which in turn helps alleviate depression.

Stay strong my friend!"

They all were at first. JFK and McNamara were the ones who were most adverse to this option, which is why I think JFK's role in this was huge.  He talked down those in favor of an invasion because he was afraid of what it would escalate to.

Also I get what you mean by them escalating the crisis, but even if the missiles were useless militarily, that fact itself would not have made a difference to the American population once it became public knowledge.  So for this reason they had to do *something*. They even believed that if they did nothing, JFK would have gotten impeached! Not to mention how the Soviets would have taken this as an indication that they could flex their muscles more in the region and who knows what that would have led to.  So the crisis had to be escalated by JFK and thankfully he handled it in the best way he could."
AskAnAmerican,fbdraxz,t3_ecu59b,1576769537.0,"Personally, Kennedy is one of my favorites for the way the Cuban Missile Crisis was handled.  The potential for global destruction was one impulse decision away.  It feels overly dramatic now, but nuclear war was still at that time a very real possibility.  

Kennedy having learned from Bay of Pigs, carefully and thoroughly examined the best courses of action while most congressmen and his military advisers were strongly supportive of a preemptive strike of the Cuban missiles, which would have certainly escalated the crisis into certain war with the Soviet Union.  It's insane how close we were to American, European, and Soviet cities being completely leveled by nuclear weapons, yet the handling of this Crisis avoided that and opened up avenues of communications between the Americans and Soviets to avoid future crises.  

I can't say with much confidence that other presidents would've handled the same situation in the way Kennedy did."
