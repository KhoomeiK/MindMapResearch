relationship_advice,fmvup80,t3_fxq4wh,1586431547.0,"That's tough, I am sorry you are going through it. I understand why you are feeling like you have been stabbed in the back, probably by both of them. The overall relationship with your ex did kind of take up a big chunk of your life, I mean, that's objectively a long and intense relationship you are describing right there. And now your best friend is kind of filling in a similar role in your ex's life to the one your gut says belongs to you or has at least belonged to you for years. 

Your friend definitely could have brought it up earlier, but I can also see how the situation has made it difficult for her to do so. Also, the ex could have reached out to you and talk about what's going on so I can't help but think it's a bit on him as well. Nevertheless, you've said it best - the truth is, you can't really choose who you fall in love in. Although I would probably go out of my mind if this happened to me, my instinct is telling me that in the end I would truly want them to be happy, even if that means finding their happiness together. I wouldn't want to stand in the way of two people experiencing love, especially if it's two people I care about a lot. Try to look at it from a larger perspective - despite all of your mutual past, they are still two individuals deserving of their own love path. Maybe it won't work out, but maybe it will. Who knows?

I also think you should really think about the guy you are seeing right now. Is he aware of what's going on with you? Would he be comfortable knowing you still have feelings for your ex?

Time makes things easier and I feel like right now it's crucial for you to try and survive through this awful new period. It's great you're in therapy right now and I think you should definitely open up about it once you finish with current topics. Wish you all the best, OP!"

It will almost be a year since my friend was killed. He was also the eldest child of my mother’s best friend. I saw the veil of pain that covered his loved ones and I am also seeing their lives now, after he’s gone. He was a passionate human being in love with life. Just like that, his life was taken away from him. 

Since it happened, I can’t shake off the question: “If a life can be taken away from someone without a warning so easily, why would I have to keep suffering with each day I am alive?” This selfish thinking makes me hate myself even more."

What you say about getting the tattoos to impress your wife and trying to be the most fun version of yourself... It's still you! Which ever ""you"" you were when getting the tattoos, it was still you. Even if you got the tattoos to fight feeling ""boring/bland"", it is still a personal experience, even if it really WAS just to impress your wife, the whole thing was an intimate personal experience and you can accept it as a part of who you are!

In the end I spend everything I have saved on food, alcohol and unnecessary shit because I lose all sense. By the end of the month, I mostly end up borrowing money from friends, which I return once I get my paycheck. I end up borrowing money because of my self-indulgence.

With a new paycheck, the cycle begins again. It’s exhausting and I am fidgety and nervous right now just from thinking about it."
