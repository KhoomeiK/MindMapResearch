I always double-check batteries make sure they're getting the right ones. She came in and yelled at me about it. I stayed calm and asked if she had her receipt because it would be easier to return. She yelled at me and told me ""I was in here 20 minutes ago I told you I didn't want it."" I looked at her and said something like ""sorry"" and she responded with a ""So you remember me now."" And I straight up told her ""I'm sorry I didn't remember if you got your receipt or not."" She complained to the manager saying I was a bitch and needed to be wrote up for it. I was more upset that the manager witnessed part of this as she was slowly walking up and didn't defend me or anything. She even said she saw her being rude to me."

UnresolvedMysteries,fei01uv,t3_eo5vk6,1579127358.0,"When I was growing up I had a neighbor who was creepy. We lived in a small town of around 100 people. He always made young girls/teens unsettled. He would just look at us in that sexual and creepy way. Like he wanted us. I'm one of the only people who knew he had raped his niece, though I didn't understand what that meant at the time. His house burned down and I didn't see him unless he was at the station or outside at another neighbor's home. 

One day when I was 13 or 14 I was walking home from the park. The station parking lot was basically a large gravel area used as a road, and such and was in front of the park also.  To get to my home I had to go down a steep road, and it was only maybe an 8-minute walk from the park to my house, but 5 minutes to my yard.  Well, I was midway down the road when a car pulled up next to me and it was him. I was polite even though I didn't like him. He tried to convince me to get in his car by offering to give me a ride to his nephew's (my friend) home because he claimed my friend really missed me ever since they moved out of town. I said no and then he tried to convince me to get a ride to my house. My yard was only a few steps away. I responded with no again and he went to reach for something in the passenger seat and was holding onto the door like he was getting out and a neighbor dropped something loud in his garage and this scared him and he drove off quickly. At the time I was confused and panicked. 

Fast forward maybe a few months to a year (I'm unsure) and I hear he's in jail. He had kidnapped a girl in the town he moved to by knifepoint. I'm unsure if he raped her or not (knowing what I knew he did to his niece) but she talked him into letting her out of the car after a few hours or so. I think he was trying to kidnap me that day and Idk if I would have been able to talk myself out. 

Now a few years later when I was 16 we moved to a different town with about the same amount of people.I've been there for a year and I walked to my bus stop because the road was kind of weird. It wasn't a problem, and typically my brother would get on the bus later so I would be standing there on my own.  The man across the street from my bus stop flashed me. I pretended it didn't happen the first time and thought maybe he was drunk or it was just a really bad realistic dream. Nope. He flashed me again the next day and even though I wasn't looking and had my back to him (I'm a freeze type of person)  I hear him step on the gravel. But I heard the bus coming down the street and his screen door slam. 

I continued to pretend this didn't happen because my brother was the only cop in town and I didn't want to look like an attention seeker by other residents. I was going to tell my bus driver I was going to need her to come up my road to get us, but my friend moved in on the street next to us (hers was a dead end) and she was going to start using that bus stop. Well not wanting anyone to know that this pervert had flashed me I stayed going to the bus stop. There had been a few times he was waiting for me outside but ran inside when he saw me and my brother or me and my friend. A few times when I got off the bus alone I would have to run because he was standing at his door or I could see him in the yard waiting. I never looked back, but I think it was possible he tried to follow me. This part makes me think why am I not dead by now sometimes. Because when my friend would come over I would follow her until I got to his house. Stand there and make sure he wouldn't be able to get out to get her to make sure she was out of my sight and close to home and I would then run home.  After I graduated (we got off a week or two ahead before the others) I saw him ride his bike by my house kind of looking at the houses on my street. I assume it was because he didn't know which house was mine. I was so happy though to see the dogs on my street chase him off. This did not keep me from being paranoid and having panic attacks for the next few years though."
ask,fdxz25d,t3_enb5tt,1578774342.0,"I live in the U.S. so it may be different, but have you thought of being a military cop? Like a police officer for the military bases and such, I think their qualifications are lower."
ask,fdxxx3o,t1_fdxrkt0,1578774033.0,"I think that he wouldn't qualify for the U.S. Military either. My brother had to have serious eye surgery as a kid due to the muscles and couldn't get into it. Even though his eyesight is considered alright now. I was looking at the Military website and these were the disqualifications and I don't think he'd qualify.
 For the Lens.

(1) Aphakia, lens implant, or dislocation of a lens.

(2) Opacities of the lens that interfere with vision or that are considered to be progressive."
ask,fdnlguq,t1_fdnkvy8,1578588277.0,"Yeah, everyone in our class was felt like it was an overreaction and it shouldn't have been banned. It was a legitimate phrase too, but she knew we were trying to pull one over so the shirts became banned. Not going to lie I moved that year or the year after and wore it to my new school. It made me sad no one really got the phrase the song wasn't as popular there as it was at the last school."
UnresolvedMysteries,fdnjzfj,t1_fdmdne6,1578587397.0,"Agree there's a lot of farmland, and woodsy areas, especially right outside of Springfield. I wouldn't be surprised if their bodies are in the woods or even in a deep ditch. That's why I always think it's crazy people believe that they were buried under a hospital (I think this was found to be false or a psychic said it or something) cause it would be much easier driving 20 minutes out of town find a wooded area and just leave the bodies there."
ask,fdniy0a,t3_em8fcq,1578586780.0,"We got ""Like a Boss"" on our Junior or Sophmore shirts (can't remember) it was to reference the song, but Nike also had the term. Our teacher thought we voted on it because of the Nike term and didn't know of the song. One of our classmates who was kind of a teacher's pet and always up someone's ass about the stupidest of things ratted us out. As a class, we all got yelled at and we weren't allowed to wear the shirts and had got other shirts with a stupid phrase. Everyone was pissed this had happened and I think people trusted her even less after this."
UnresolvedMysteries,fddyjwj,t1_fdasany,1578327091.0,Check out Classmates they have yearbooks from many schools on there. People upload their yearbooks on there. The years your looking for may not be in there though.
UnresolvedMysteries,fd77vd5,t3_ek7o18,1578200579.0,I also think it may be likely that Richard may have killed her. At least if it wasn't him it was likely someone she knew. It would make sense she would leave with someone she knew since she got dressed before leaving.
UnsolvedMurders,fc1q6gt,t1_fc1h87s,1577326225.0,"No problem with the links. Sorry, I misunderstood your post. Once in awhile I'll see online people being insensitive towards families due to them not wanting to talk about their murdered loved ones.  I thought I would try to give a heads up about it. I'll for sure check out your podcast I'm always looking out for new ones. :)"
UnsolvedMurders,fc1guau,t3_efcdcv,1577318360.0,"Just a warning please be careful when talking to people about their murdered loved ones. I have a cousin who was killed and it's been 14 years and it's still painful for some of us especially when someone who didn't know him wants to talks about it. So don't be surprised if people shut you out and refuse to talk. 

I also write a blog that started out as a mystery blog but became more of an unsolved crime blog. You'll be surprised how many unsolved cases have one or two sentences about the murder. Some don't even have pictures of the victims. 
Here's a list of websites that I complied with eventually I'll add other countries to it and the list is always being updated. https://counteverymystery.blogspot.com/search/label/Sources

Here's some cases with little information and maybe you'll do a better job on researching then I can.

UnresolvedMysteries,fc1dhpr,t1_fc1c8w1,1577315495.0,I wonder if that was it and the fear and panic at the time convinced her of his hallucination.
AskReddit,fbzqn0o,t1_fbxklka,1577256649.0,"When I worked at the gas station on Holidays or birthdays people who the bar stopped serving people and they try to buy beer/liquor at our store with this excuse. ""But it's my Birthday."" or ""It's Christmas"" I'd have to turn them away and tell them it's not my problem. It was very annoying."
AskReddit,fbzqf12,t1_fbzo4fd,1577256358.0,I second this I have had more near-death experiences with cars than I have with guns.
