Second its non of his goddamn business what medication you take when and where. It's pretty childish of him to be that uncomfortable with the idea of other people having sex.

Like you I know for sure I like girls, but I can't tell if actually like guys or if I've just been trying to for to long to tell. Sometimes I think I'm bi and other times I cant imagine myself with a guy. Personally, I'm trying not to worry about labels at all right now. I dont really think I need a label until I'm ready to come out anyway. I think it's just about giving your enough time to figure out and become comfortable with your sexuality."
mentalhealth,f8in2n3,t3_e0wley,1574590618.0,As far as I understand it your psychiatrist should only tell you parents if you a danger to your or others or if changes are made to your medication. They shouldn't be sharing everything with your parents. If you're worried it would come to that you can try and make seem not as serious and just tell your psychiatrist that you're been feeling more numb lately. If you tell them you've been starting to feel worse again maybe they'll make some adjustments to your meds or therapy without it seeming as worrisome. Although you sure be able to be honest with your psychiatrist and if they talk to your parents or adjust your medication. Just tell your parents that you were starting to feel a bit worse again and you just wanted to fix it before it got to be a problem. That way they don't worry your getting worse and instead they think your just preventing yourself from getting worse. Telling your psychiatrist something to make sure they improve your health is better then just pretending its fine. Best case scenario you can tell you psychiatrist the full truth and get help and just tell you parents it's being handled. But at the very least you have to tell your psychiatrist something even if you downplay it.

Pets,f816d4d,t3_dygsu5,1574152357.0,"Punishing a dog for soiling in the house I'd not productive on the least. Dog think differently then people and you're more likely to confuse him. He is likely to believe that you are either mad at him for pooping in general, in which case he may be afraid to poop when you walk him and he'll end up pooping when you cant see him. This leads some dogs to start pooping under beds and other places they think you won't find. Now if he have a yard to go in without being seen this might not cause issues. However the other possible outcome to punishment is that he thinks it is about territory, in the wild animals only get mad about other animals pooping when it is about territory. In which case, the dog may feel unwelcome in the home which can lead to anxiety and other behavior problems. 

If the dog is potty trained already then he not likely pooping inside on purpose. It is likely due to him not being taken out side often enough or on a regular schedule. If he still needs potty training  then he needs a regular schedule of going out every time he wakes up or eats and before bed. He should be praised for going out side and if he goes inside he should be talking outside to remind him where he should go. Dogs don't actually need punishment for potty training because once a potty place and home are established it is natural for dogs to not poop or pee in what they consider their den."
ShaneDawson,f7m0g30,t3_dwvl1k,1573851771.0,Shane's procrastinating on this episode for sure. For all the others he needed to get to the reveal before the launch but now he doesn't have anything to keep him from putting it off or over editing it. I think jeffree knew that and was trying to give him a deadline. But in the end all of the pressure is gone and it will probably be like next week or so.

ShaneDawson,f6v7gsz,t3_dt64iz,1573178631.0,"Honestly I think everyone forgets that shane is an entertainer. I enjoy the episodes and I bought the palette because I think it looks cool and I'll use it. But I don't buy in to all the ""omg I'm just so genuine and I can't believe people like me... I just care too much"" crap that he overloads his videos with (I mean he edits the videos and every 5mins he or someone else stops to remind you that's he's super humble). I believe he's a nice person and he seems really passionate about his projects. In the end though he's a entertainer, he's in it for the money and fame like most big Youtubers. That doesn't make him a bad person or anything I mean it's his job.
I'm not surprised he's not going to release the last episodes. they'll inevitably get less views and he's all ready sold out on the merch and make up. The final episodes are unlike to bring enough hype to effect the restock sales. I really hope he does realise at least one episode of the aftermath, because I the the series will feel incomplete without it. But I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't."
lgbt,f6ladr2,t3_drreku,1572934923.0,"Yeah I have alot of conservative family and alot of them complain when any movie, tv show, or even the news takes about gay people. They always say that the media wants us to think that they're are more gay people then their actually are. They say that if they were so many gay people then why is that they don't know any. It doesn't seem to occur to them that the people they know who are gay just don't tell them. I mean I'm not telling them I'm gay, why would I when they fsst forward and rant for 5 minutes if a gay couple even flirts or kisses, but they'll watch a full sex scene with no comment if it's a straight couple. To me it seems pretty obvious that you'll know less openly gay people if you make it known that you hate them."
Pets,f6l84mh,t3_drq2pb,1572932321.0,"Yeah there are spray you can buy for killing fleas. They are usually called knock out or knock down sprays. You can buy them at like petsmart or some like farm feed type stores. Just make sure their are no oeys in the room when you spray it and make sure you follow the directions. Some you can just leave for a few hours and then it's safe for your pets to return to the area, but others need to be vacuumed or mopped up. 

Other tips for getting rid of fleas are vacuuming the house alot more often, treating your yard if you can, and got to a vet to get a prescription grade flea medication. Like simparica or nexgaurd or something. Flea baths are collars usually only kill adult fleas while the eggs, larva and pupae are still fine. The eggs will hang out in your dogs for for a while until they fall of into the yard or carpeted the they hatch and in a few days, then the larva will live in the carpets for a week or so until they pupae. They'll live in their cocoon for a week to a month until they sense a viable host to hop on to. So if you give your dog a few flea baths the fleas will return in a month or so. I work a vet clinic and alot of people have been having terrible flea issues this year and frontline and store bought flea collars haven't been work for alot of people. 

Anyway treating the area is usually just as important as treating the dog so get some knock out spray and some yard flea killer and repeat all treatment in a month so they don't come back."

Theres a pair of Male vultures in a zoo that were together 18 years trying to make nests and raise a family, until the zoo finally gave them a orphaned egg. The two worked together to hatch the egg, raised the baby, and teach him to fly. According to the zoo the baby did extremely well and when he was ready to leave his dads was released into the wild last year."

Now that I know more about birds from friends who have some I admire them from afar. I don't have enough time now I I definitely didn't as a teen. People need to stop promoting budgies and other small birds as good first pets.their are so many other small affectionate and smart pets for people with less experience and time."
