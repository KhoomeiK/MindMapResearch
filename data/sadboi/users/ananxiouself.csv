mentalhealth,fqd850m,t3_ghrmqw,1589282902.0,"The only thing I want to end is how it seems most people are acting, because it gives me a lot of anxiety. Only thing people talk about is quarantine, a lot of people I know or family are sucked into conspiracy, and so on. Then when it comes to completing necessary errands, which already made me so anxious before, now send me into panic or dread. 

But all of this has made me realize how so much of the world is focused on forced interaction, or at least the high expectations of it. This really seems unfair when so many people also thrive doing the opposite, and it's clear that there is plenty of possibility in making things easier for an introverted lifestyle, or even for those who may simply have obstacles to doing everything in the strict way that things may have applied to prior to quarantine.

A lot of us are thriving with the world being forced to work differently, and I wish it didn't have to be in a poor circumstance for this to be available."

Anxietyhelp,fpnmhr9,t1_fpnlvgj,1588767436.0,"That's what I have been told, is that you get used to it. I've always told myself how crazy it is we can adapt so almost anything, and here I am. We get used to our lashes or nose in our vision, but this stands out so much to me. I know it's going to take a lot of patience to get used to. My doctor also said to not be worried unless it changes, but that keeps me so anxious about any changes with these therefore I'm always looking to find them. It's gotten better the past week trying to avoid knowing they're there by focusing on my senses (5 things I hear, feel, etc) bc meditating or other things weren't doing the trick for me. But I also will stumble upon it and then can't help but look for it again, and again. I hate the idea of this.

Thank you for reaching out, because I have been needing to know I am not alone in this."
Anxietyhelp,fpnkolf,t3_ge487s,1588765956.0,"I feel like I wrote this post. I've resulted to so many of my old, bad habits with avoidance during all of this. I'm comfortable with being alone and couped up, but over time feel so much more anxious regardless. For the first time in my over twenty years of life, I even attempted to reach out to get some kind of therapy. Because I force myself to meditate, and take part in hobbies every day, yet I am still so uncomfortable about how the world is going right now. It turned out my insurance didn't cover therapy, so I feel stuck. 

I can't stick to routines, I never have. I feel more anxious applying expectations like these, and others to myself. So I really am unsure what to do here other than nonstop distractions, like playing games, reading, and building on other hobbies. Or even drinking and connecting with friends, but in the long run I'm not sure this is the best choice. I worked hard to tackle a no avoidance policy, alongside having no intoxicants to better manage my emotional control and have more clarity. Not I am lost and feel these are the only options, because the meditating and the hobbies aren't helping on top of everything else.."
Anxietyhelp,fpnk2pd,t3_gebuly,1588765428.0,"I am battling this as well, and I've found a few things that help me. One of the biggest things I found when trying to understand my anxiety with health related issues was learning how to re-identify what is making me anxious. So for example, I kept telling myself that doctor's visits were an opportunity for me to learn and grow, so I would feel more influenced to pursue them. I love to learn how to take better care of myself, and learning is something that motivates me in general.

I also clinged to the idea that anxiety may make us feel safe, but it's not keeping us safe. It actually does the opposite, because it is a very painful experience. What I like to remember is to stay alert, but not anxious. It is good to remain aware of dangers, but anxiety will make us less efficient. Staying alert helps us stay safe, and intellectual about our situation. 

Lastly I try to focus on the way I build up stress over things that make me anxious. I tend to see myself as a source of various problems, whereas I may create them. I have to remember that there are flaws in the world and they are not my fault, as many people deal with so many issues influenced by outside sources that we can not control. What we can control is how we react to these. There is also a persistent idea that conflicts I encounter will influence so much more or become permanent, and I have to remind myself that these are individual and specific issues which do not imply the end of all. So for example, I worry my health will turn out to be without resolution, and therefore I panic to find out that things are inevitable. It turns out that there are a lot of solutions in the modern world, and the issues we face are independent, specific issues that can be faced with so many steps we may not even be aware of. This is the entire point of keeping up on our health, and for me even though the biggest obstacle is interacting with people to get through my doctor or dentist appointments, I remember that I am lucky to have these opportunities to stay healthy and alert of what I could be facing. I am therefore open to learn about how to be a happy, healthy individual.

I hope this helps."

omegle,fpiefx3,t3_gdni1g,1588639222.0,Yeah I was gonna say. A lot of the time something happens on accident. Happened to me yesterday and I'm pretty sad I'll probably never find the friend I made on Omegle. Plus they probably think I just dipped. ðŸ˜¢
omegle,fpgniho,t1_fpfr1fb,1588606108.0,I will forever take this advice due to a similar situation. I learned my lesson.
