The next day I went to the library again. I checked out a book and returned one I already read, and made my way home to indulge myself in a snack and a book. As I was walking home, though, I heard some commotion coming from the bank. Curious, I walked in.   
People were sitting down as masked men clad in black each held a gun, pointed at anyone who moved.  
I was in the middle of a bank robbery.  
I almost dropped my books in shock. Then, I got curious. They forgot me as soon as they saw me, so I figured I could just walk around. And I did. Only a couple of the hostages gave me funny looks, but even those quickly faded. I made my way into the back where I heard rummaging. Bags of cash were just... sitting there. More was being piled on b a couple more people.   
It was really hard for me to get money. I made food to sell online, but that never really worked all of the time. I had a hunch that even the words that I write were hard to remember.   
Even so, I always did alright. I was almost constantly hungry, but never starving.   
But that large amount of money... it called to me like nothing else.  
I shook myself out of it. What would I even do with that much money? It was hard for me to even buy food at stores. They kept piling money.  
Out of a moment of weakness, I took a bag of money. I walked straight home, hoping nobody would notice. Of course I didn't need to worry. They never noticed.   
I plopped the bag onto the floor and went to go take a shower.   
I felt strangely serene, despite having just committed thievery. What would I even do with my money? I guess I could use it as needed, but with this much money, I could do more. I could do so much more.   
I sighed. I really couldn't, though. Transactions were always such a problem for me. I thought to myself for a little, then I realized something. Buying stuff might be hard for me, but they wouldn't be hard for somebody else. I took out my phone and called up Kirt.   
""Kirt? You need to come over here. I need some help.""

""John! What did you do?!"" Kirt had come over, spotted the bag of cash and immediately guessed what had happened.   
""Kirt. I know this seems like it's bad-""  
""It IS bad!""  
""I know, but hear me out. With my ability to be forgotten like that,"" I snapped for emphasis ""I can do anything I want. No consequences.""  
Kirt looked like he was going to protest, but before he could say anything, I cut him off. ""The only problem is that I can't use it. But you can. I-""  
""No! What makes you think I'm going to HELP you?""  
""Kirt, please, you're the only one that can help me.""  
""No. I'm leaving. John, I know there's good in you. You need to return that money. Goodbye."" Kirt left, slamming the door behind him.  
I kicked the sofa, stubbing my toe, but not caring in my rage. The only person who could remember me, and they refused to help me. I would show him. I formulated a plan in my mind. 

For The Swordsman there was the Confederate army. For Odin, there were the high seas. For every superhero, there would be opposition.   
Kirt may be the good guy here. But I am the superhero."
WritingPrompts,fhz9en0,t3_f5enfm,1581993897.0,"The name's Johnathan. Johnathan Hawthorne. I can say with certainty that you do not know me, except maybe for other text posts on social media. The reason I can say this with such certainty is because I was cursed with a... unique visage. Anybody who looks at me forgets me immediately.   
I haven't been able to hold a job, getting food to eat is a nightmare, school was always fine, though. In any case, this problem has caused almost nothing but trouble all of my life.

Almost.

I don't know why the idea had never occurred to me before, but here's the story of how I became the world's least known superhero.

I was walking home from the store. I was only getting some eggs, milk and some cheetos, but as usual, these simple tasks were never even close to simple. When checking out, the cashier kept forgetting what she was doing, and, with a confused look on her face, cleared the conveyor belt of my groceries. It took her five times to scan everything, and another ten tries for me to get her to accept my money.   
I would eat out, but that's impossible. Needless to say, I learned to cook pretty fast.   
I got home, doffed my shoes and coat, and went to the kitchen to put away my spoils of war.   
After that, I sat down and watched some TV. Apparently some bank had been robbed, and it was a big deal. I didn't use the bank, so I didn't care. But it was funny to me, because the very fact that everybody knew the bank had been robbed made it harder for the thief to escape. People would be on the lookout for the person, and when they tracked large amount of money to him, he would be done for. He'd have to launder the money as soon as possible, but even that could be tracked. If he were invisible, he probably could escape any consequence. People can't catch what they can't see.  
I took another fingerful of cheetos to my mouth. Flaming hot. My favorite. I went in for another, but found only crumbs. I turned off the TV and stood up to throw away the bag. The saddest part of eating anything was when it was over. Throwing away the bag was like lowering a coffin of a loved one into their grave. They were just shell of who they used to be, everything you enjoyed about them, gone. I whistled a little bit of a funeral hymn to myself as I walked out the door.  
The library was always one of my favorite places. I stood at the door, looking in, then stepped past the threshold. It was always quiet, which was nice, but despite that, there wasn't any necessary human interaction, meaning no waving in front of somebody's face, trying to get them to notice you and complete the task they were doing. Just pick a book, show the card, then go home. It was a little tricky GETTING the library card, but I only had to do it once.   
I strode over to the nonfiction section. I know that makes me a little bit of a geek, but I always loved reading real stories. Especially the ones about superheros.   
Nobody knows where they come from, or often, even their names. Even worse is that they're not common. You can't study what you can't find. One of my favorite heroes has always been The Swordsman. He was a hero back in the civil war, and helped push the tide of the Battle of Manassas in favor of the Union. Without his help, the Confederates might have won, and who knows where the war could have gone from there. With a sword in one hand and shield in the other, he faced down armies by slicing bullets out of the air, and the ones he didn't were caught by his shield. And then there was Odin. Named after the Norse god, he was a powerful viking who helped a fleet circle the world by calming the seas. Reading stories like these always put me in a different world. One where I could pretend I was a powerful hero who would be noticed.   
I reached for a book that I had read multiple times, but when I expected to find the plastic covering of a library book, I found skin. A short young man, maybe in his late 20s by the looks of him, had gotten there first. He had glasses, short blond hair, and fair skin.   
""Oh! Sorry!"" He said, then quickly pulled back his hand.  
I grunted and took the book. I didn't bother with niceties anymore. Nobody remembered, anyways. I turned to walk away, but before I could, I heard a small, yet surprising harumph from behind me. I almost ignored it. I should have.   
I spun around. ""Wait,"" my voice croaked ""Did you harumph at me?""  
""... Maybe? I mean, you didn't even say thanks. I'm sorry, that was petty of me-""  
""No, wait,"" I cut him off ""You remember that?""  
""Uh... yes.""  
""How?"" I was incredulous. How did this person remember me?  
""I mean, it just happened. How am I supposed to not remember it?""  
""I..."" I was on the edge of tears. ""Do... Do you want to get a coffee or something sometime?"" My voice was raspy.   
""Sure, I guess. Can I get your phone number?""  
I gave it to him, and we decided on a date. 

We met at a nice, small, quiet coffee shop at the edge of town, We both got drinks and we started talking. I was still surprised he even remembered that we were supposed to meet.  
""So,"" he began, after he took a sip, looking down at the table ""You seemed really surprised that I remembered you at the library. What was that about?""  
""Nobody ever remembers me."" I mutter  
""Oh, I'm sure that's not true! What about your family?""  
""Completely forgot about me by age 16. They swear they've only had two kids in the family.""  
""Oh..."" He takes another sip. Then ""What's your name?""  
I hadn't heard it in so long, I had almost forgotten.  
""I think it's... John. Ha.. Hawtho- Hawthorn? Johnathan Hawthorne.""  
""Nice to meet you, Johnathan! I'm Kirt.""  
""It's good to meet you Kirt.""  
We talked. I told him about how life is like without anyone remembering you, he told me about how he figured out he had eidetic memory. He suggested that maybe that's why he could remember me even though others couldn't. We talked a long time. The sun had already set when he realized he had somewhere to be, stood up, and thanked me and ran off.   
Tired, but happy for the first time in a long while, I walked home, whistling a merry tune, and went to sleep."

I remembered tall, dark creatures, and bright lights and... oh, the pain. It arced all across my body, like my blood turned white-hot. I must have passed out when it reached my brain.  
I felt a sudden burning in my throat, and I rushed to the bathroom to vomit. Afterwards, i swished some water in my mouth to get some of the taste out.   
I rubbed my face. Maybe it was just a dream? No, it felt too real...  
I winced again, just thinking about the agony. I splashed some cold water in my face, and looked in the mirror. Normally, there would be large, red spots all over my face, but they didn't seem so bad....  
I didn't have my glasses on.  
I froze, my mind drew a blank, and I could barely even breathe.  
I didn't have my glasses on, and I could *see.*  
Was I dreaming? I pinched myself, and found only pain. I found myself only drawing a blank as I tried to comprehend what was happening, but I couldn't. I just stared at my reflection. 

""y̸̛̳ů̶̜v̴̭͝n̶͚̋w̶̬̒q̴̘̇m̶̱͑o̶͉̽ ̷̘͐ĉ̷̦w̶̦̽i̸̼͝v̴̱̀m̸̙͌ ̶̱̌c̴̰͒u̸̙͝"" Said a voice in my head. It was unintelligible, and it *hurt.* I clutched the sides of my head and screamed. It felt like my skull was vibrating, and my muscles were so tense, I felt like they could snap. As suddenly as it started, it stopped.   
""Is is working now? God, your brains are so strange. No matter, are you hurt?""  
""..."" I wasn't able to say anything before the voice responded.  
""It seems like you are experiencing psychological recoil due to the previous incident. Don't worry, it's over now. I believe you've already noticed the repairs made to your eyesight. I don't understand why your eyes weren't already adequate, but that doesn't matter anymore. Please stand.""  
I did as the voice asked. I had no idea what was happening, but resistance seemed like it would just make things harder.  
""Congratulations on compliance."" I suddenly felt a bit more relaxed, like everything was going to be okay. I took a deep breath and - *Oh, shit, there's a voice in my brain, and I don't need my glasses and what the actually hell is happening-*  
The happiness was gone and replaced by more panic.   
""That was a mood-boost as a reward for compliance. Expect more in the future as you obey. Now for a quick orientation. We have gifted you with more muscle mass, an improved cardiovascular system, and many other things that will optimize your performance. Use these advantages to your liking, but when we contact you, we do require that you obey. Talk soon.""  
The voice was gone.  
And I was left alone. With my thoughts.  
And there was just one thing I was thinking.

So even if you don't have depression (which I would say you prolly do, but I'm not a doctor) your feelings are valid.

Yes, you are absolutely right. Honestly, I'm a little lost in the first bit, but my takeaway is that you feel that you should have rights and that a trans man made you feel like you shouldn't. I'll let y'all in on a funny little secret....  
WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS.  
For those of us in the back: **WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS.**  
Hey homophobes, hey transphobes, hey all 'yall who think others don't have rights: ***WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS***

# WE ALL HAVE RIGHTS

Not only have multiple philosophers delved into this, but we continue, throughout history, FOR SOME REASON BEYOND MY GRASP have *had to have* multiple groups, people, organizations telling us this. Why? Maybe I'm an idiot that doesn't know anything, so excuse my breathtaking ignorance and my incapability to grasp WHY. WHY IN THE WORLD. We still don't fully understand that EVERYBODY HAS RIGHTS.   
In summary, yes, you have rights.

Okay with that topic out of the way, let me move into one that is perhaps even more controversial. Yes we have rights, but what kind of rights? Well, here's another funny little secret. They're equal. We have equal rights. What about blacks? Are they human? If the answer is yes, then they have human rights. How about gays? If they are human, then they have human rights. Lesbians? Trans? Etc, etc. IF THEY ARE HUMAN, THEY HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS. 

Well, *gosh darned*, if everybody is equal, why do we even have labels like 'gay' or 'lesbian' or 'ace' or anything relating to sexual orientation, gender, race, or anything for that matter? With this in mind, it kind of seems like a waste of time!

YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.  IT MAKES NO SENSE. 

Let me show you in a different way. Hello, my name is \*\*\*\*\*\* and I like women AND men. Am I just a horny teenager? Maybe. Does it matter? Well, let's figure it out! Am I a human? I like to think that most would consider me a human. This means (as I said, you may not remember) that I have human rights!! In the constitution, it says that my inalienable rights are ""Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" Now I'm no history major or anything, but I can tell you that the statement is kind of vague. Let's go through this one by one. 

Life - This was probably partially influenced by Hobbes' assertion that the Leviathan shouldn't be allowed to kill anyone needlessly. However, I propose that this should also mean that I have a right to live my life the way I want. So long as I don't repress others' rights. (this goes for all rights)

Liberty - SUPER vague. However, I think that it should mean that if we are being oppressed, we have a right to rebel against oppression. We'll get back to this later.

Pursuit of happiness - EVEN MORE VAGUE. Let's assume it's not meant that we indulge in hedonism. This still gives us rights to many things. A right to pursue emotional/mental stability, a right to do what is best for our family and kinsmen. A right to be content.

ALRIGHT BACK TO THE QUESTION AT HAND. Does it matter if I'm just a horny teenager and say that I like both men and women? Well, if we take a look here, it seems like all signs point to I***T'S NONE OF YOUR GOSH-DARNED BUSINESS.***   
I can do with my life what I want, and nobody can tell me otherwise because not only am I not affecting anybody, but if they told me what to do, that would be infringing on my rights. Again note that this is only because ITS NOT HURTING ANYONE. Secondly, the constitution itself says that I am able to pursue happiness and therefore, I am doing exactly as the constitution encourages!! 

So therefore, it doesn't matter if you identify as gay, bi, lesbian or whatever have you. In reality, none of that matters because the only thing that ANYONE. ANYONE. should EVER see. Is the fact that you are a human.  
However, if we continue having titles like any in the lgbtq+ community, then we are effectively setting people apart from others and putting people in boxes WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS THIS COMMUNITY EXISTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. People tried to get themselves away from boxes and in doing so JUST MADE MORE BOXES. These not only set apart people from each other, but also discourage flexibility. Maybe I AM a horny teenager. I shouldn't have to come out as bi, then get into my adult years and realize I'm straight, and then come out as that. I should only be considered as human.

I realize that the lgbtq+ community is good, since it promotes equality, just in it's own way. However, this should only be considered as a crutch, and it should be dissolved as soon as possible. I can't wait until the day where rainbow flags don't only represent lgbtq+ in peoples' minds, but instead represent humanity as a whole. I can't wait until pride month isn't only thought of as a month for gays and such, but as a month to celebrate how far we as humans have come. 

I can't wait until there is no more lgbtq+ community."

""WHAT NOW?!""

"".... Hi.""

Dave sighed and rubbed his face. It was till a long ways until Kycash, and the company wasn't getting any more enjoyable. When you tell somebody that 'where ever you go, Death follows', their first thought is normally that people die around you. While that is true, I mean, he DOES have a job, but it's not unpleasant. Death is fair, and only kills my companions when they had it coming.

But nobody talks about how Death is a real d\*\*\*.

""Hey, Dave, I really need to use the bushes. Could we stop for a bit? Pleasepleasepleasepleaseple-""

""FINE!! Fine. Just go. Do it fast.""

Death grinned. He had no choice, but the reality of the grin made itself more present for the time being. Death got off of his pale horse and skipped to the bushes. As soon as he was out of sight, Dave kicked his horse into action, and tried to get as much distance between he and Death as possible. He knew it would eventually be fruitless - he'd tried this before - but it was worth trying again. 

As expected, he heard a distant clip-clop of horse hooves, and as he looked back, Dave could see a pale horse and it's rider coming at him with incredible speed- Oh dear ZEUS. Was that a DOG??

""DAVE!! I found a friend!!""

""Great! Now put him back.""

""Please can we keep him?""

The dog looked thin and hungry, but was happier than any other being he had seen in the arms of Death. 

""No, we can't keep him!!! I only have so much rations left, and even though you don't need to eat, you still manage to steal my food, eat it, AND DIGEST IT. We can't have another mouth to feed.""

Death looked at Dave with his empty sockets, and a single black tear started to drip down his cheekbone. 

""Ughhhh.... Fine. We can keep him. But you're in charge of him.""

""Yay! Did you hear that, boy, you can come with us!""

The dog squirmed in delight. They continued walking. Death was a terrible companion to have on a road trip. He couldn't hold it to save his pseudo-life, he talked constantly about how I was going to die and how fun it was going to be for him to watch, and he wore an excessive amount of hourglass jewelry, and wouldn't stop flaunting it at any opportunity. But there are worse companions. 

Imagine if I were travelling with a demon! That would suck.
