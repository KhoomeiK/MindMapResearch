Like I enjoyed the way you described the lady and the things she communicated to you, especially the part about the good news. There’s a part of me that hopes another reality is real and that’s it’s positive but I bet everything on trying to discover that world and it just left me in the psyche ward... sorry to be a Debbie downer"
schizophrenia,ewk4byk,t3_com185,1565476332.0,You could say it influenced it. I fell on train tracks from a couple stories and broken my arm... I was trying to get into heaven. Or out of the matrix. I also had a messiah complex at the time so maybe I was sacrificing myself? I’m really not sure but the psychosis was based on religion absolutely. And yet my parents still think I should be a Christian

bipolar,ervpimv,t3_c49ijf,1561321817.0,I think my super power was to never be bored. My brain would take every coincidence or overheard conversation as a sign or key revelation about my life that was deeply fascinating. I experienced life as poetic and the events as metaphoric or symbolic of another dimension. I had a zest for living that could not be matched
