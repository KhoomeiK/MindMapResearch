But if that’s how you wanna go, start saving money for the best hospice care or a trip to a country that allows euthanasia."

depression_help,erh2xfi,t3_c21p70,1560865764.0,"I am in the same shoes as you. I have children and I am trying my best to not screw them up irreversibly by dying now. 
I know finances can be tough but is there a suicide helpline you can call or religious counselling service that would be more affordable than the usual psychologists and psychiatrists?
My therapist is also very expensive but has offered to reduce her rate to help me and also referred me to a Catholic counselling group that is cheaper. I am going for that option because I need help too. I look at my kids and while they are beautiful, the thoughts don’t go
Away. 
I just tell myself Not Now. I can’t afford to die now."

I am so afraid to go on the meds, reading about side effects are scary. Also she is too expensive for me to maintain on a weekly basis right now... $200 a session out of pocket!"
SuicideWatch,er4aqee,t3_c0ewbc,1560485461.0,"Join the club... I researched ways to kill myself and none of them are guaranteed to work except for euthanasia. I can’t wait to get a terminal disease so I can opt to kill myself.
Meanwhile I have kids to live for. Do you have someone or some pet to live for?"

depression,eqqsimd,t3_byz6d4,1560230849.0,Me too. I can’t wait to get Cancer so I can officially kill myself and no one can say that it was selfish or stupid.
depressed,eqidio7,t1_eqgaizu,1560084797.0,Totally with you on that
SuicideWatch,eqidcx5,t3_byd713,1560084696.0,"That was my last 24 hours.
Had a great night at the theatre, even had sex with my husband, then woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning. Lashed out at said husband and felt so guilty and down that I wanted to die. Been thinking the suicidal thoughts for the last 8 hours. Unfortunately or fortunately I have young children so I can’t afford to die now."
