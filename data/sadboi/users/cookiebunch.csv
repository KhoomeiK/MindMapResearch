50s or not, they could have mobility issues they aren't sharing with you. Just get headphones? Or leave the room. I don't see what the issue is, espeically if you know that they often sleep there."

Reddit is going to tell you your mother is a narcissistic, toxic asshole. From what you're saying, she sounds very scared of your father. She ""can't tolerate"" him anymore. Okay, why? If she's leaving because he's being emotionally abusive or worse then yeah, I get her lashing out and saying something less than stellar to you even though she really shouldn't have. 

You're not obligated to support her, but just be aware that (from either parent) you are likely not getting the full story. Also, you said you didn't want to pick sides but you have clearly picked your dad's."
hockey,fpwl7ih,t1_fpwhmtw,1588965411.0,"Right, that's on the ice. I'm a female hockey player, I know what's said. I can't speak for super high levels but I can say that off-ice we're not discussing guys (or girls), teammates, and their SOs like those guys were. That culture (off ice) isn't inherent to all hockey despite it being an aggressive sport was my point."

>  You're never going to have a civil, respectful, *gentle, kind* or compassionate culture when it's literally your job to be as physically hyper-aggressive towards your peers as you can.  

Female hockey player culture isn't nearly this bad and aggressive though and they're equally aggressive (minus legal hitting) on the ice.   If you go through their dms I am sure you won't find this level of stuff."

Last week was the first week since el filing that I had worked zero hours (I had partial hours for a few weeks prior) and because of the 0 hour week following a week where I had hours, the system said I had to reopen my claim to get my benefits.  I think I followed the instructions but I haven't gotten any confirmation or payment.  

When I check my status, it just shows the week before as the last week I got benefits and the week after as the next eligible.  I'm so confused and frustrated."

Seeing him pop up as ""active"" at the same time as the girl he used to hook up with kills me because it seems to happen way to often. And then he likes her posts and that's it of course he's gonna ditch me and they'll get married and have 3 kids and I'll end up rotting alone."

People with BPD can be apologetic and aren't inherently abusive. Rebecca also has done some deeply troubling things, as others have pointed out. She also tried to kill herself on more than one occasion.  Her life was deeply impacted by this disorder."
BPD,esb4nlz,t3_c6tmfd,1561778034.0,"For me, the only way to stop obsessing is to force myself to do something else. Anything else. Especially something either a) with other people or b) where I can do it without needing my phone. It's kind of a bandaid, because it only helps me for a bit. But if you keep busy enough, that's less time your devoting to obsessing."
