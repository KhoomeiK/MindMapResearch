I will disregard everything that is said to me about you”. Not talking about me but that is a bold statement and makes a person look hard headed but it’s true. My point is, God is allowing us to think that way and simply faith will not convert many people. He shouldn’t punish us for being curious and the lack of evidence not there to make us believe in him.

offmychest,fl3ip5j,t3_fmcnfj,1584785821.0,"I understand your situation even though I’ve never had that happen to me. Only because I really don’t tell people about me in that manner, I wish I knew the words to make you feel better and it really is a bummer how your friend is being short/ghosting you after you opening up. The hard truth is that some people either don’t care, doesn’t want you to start acting like a leech, and some doesn’t want to feel the obligation to constantly check on you. Others though may have a type of way to reacting to things in which they don’t see anything wrong with it so they’ll continue to do it or even they just don’t know what to say. I don’t want to put ideas in your head about why she is doing that to you, and for her being your friend of 6 years doesn’t really make sense to me why she would basically ignore you opening up and acting like it isn’t a big deal. My best advice to give you is, don’t let this hold you back from opening up to someone who you truly would like to do that with sometime in the future. It may be a nerve wrecking thing to do considering your past experiences with other people, but it never hurts to try and you never know who will actually be willing to listen and talk to you about it. I’m very sorry about your friend acting that way towards you and shit must feel like all those years of friendship doesn’t mean much to her only to just call you a friend (I knew a few people like that). I have gone to seek help aswell and for me too, I was put on Meds which I stopped taking. What helps me is the feeling of accomplishment, I make a list of what needs to be done, even if it’s something little to do I’ll try to make sure that list is done at the end of the day, then I take a nice long shower and after that I feel pretty good! Even tho I’m still pretty gloomy I get some relief from all the demeaning thoughts, worries, and sadness that I’m feeling and just chill out. Also, talking to a close family member about how I’m feeling most definitely gives me a “feeling better” boost for the day. Just having a little dedication to making a change in the right direction is way more than good enough. I believe in you and really hope things start turning up for you!"

No, if I’m tired of seeing a wrestler on screen there’s gotta be a reason. Therefore I state mine. Who says I’m hating anyways. I never once said I disliked her, she’s a bad person, or I can’t stand seeing her without wanting to cut my eyes out. Like I said I am getting tired of her gimmick & how they want to make her over as much as possible. You’re making it seem that I’m hoping on this bandwagon hate train where it’s a chain of the same argument. I know what I’m talking about and stating my thoughts is just simply how I feel about her. Take it or leave it. Btw, I actually never disliked Kofi, Seth, or Roman. I even enjoyed seeing Roman on screen when everybody else was so sick and tired of him. He was a head heel & I enjoyed it. Matter of fact I’m tired of Brock Lesnar coming around just to take a title & then leaving. It’s a rinse & repeat cycle with him and it’s just pure bullshit now. With Becky it’s “fight this girl-win, fight this girl-win, fight this girl-get interrupted, fight this girl-get interrupted...repeat” there’s never a true sign of weakness from her where the opponent clearly has the upper hand. Also, her promos are just her trying to act tough as possible with almost the same as last badassery attitude speech. She’s getting boring!

I did state that I’m more for in ring performance, but when you begin to get tired of seeing her nothing can remotely excite me anymore even if if she got a couple of new badass moves. Maybe her losing the title and having a good story line to follow up is what she needs now for people to stay interested in her. She’s still loved by many but it won’t be too long when everyone will start to get annoyed with it all.  The push has gone too far imo, so much now that when Shayna Baszler started to have some beef with her & Bayley. I couldn’t of cared less. So for me personally it’s gonna take a lot for me to be interested in her again. Even just a little bit."
