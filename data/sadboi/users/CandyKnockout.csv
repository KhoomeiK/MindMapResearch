MadOver30,fqymby7,t3_glg3kx,1589750919.0,"I just want to commend you for recognizing you have these issues and wanting to fix them. I’d say you’re more in the camp of having narcissistic tendencies rather than just being a straight up narcissistic, since most people with actual narcissistic personality disorder will never admit they’re in the wrong or that their feelings of jealousy aren’t valid. But I’ve seen people with tendencies get closer and closer to being an actual narcissistic because they never reflected on their behavior and surrounded themselves with people whose only purpose was to validate them, so it’s a good idea to confront yourself about these feelings and behaviors before they become an ingrained part of you.

It doesn’t make you a bad person to *have* these tendencies. Most people have things in their personalities that aren’t great. But the behaviors these tendencies can make you exhibit (being overly demanding of others, believing others are in your life to fulfill your needs, doing nice and generous things for the sole purpose of getting attention and convincing others you’re a good person, being unable to celebrate the triumphs of your friends because you’re jealous, getting upset when the expectations you came up with in your head aren’t performed by another person, not being able to accept any blame in a disagreement even though it was caused by your actions, just to name a few) can make you a miserable person on the inside and make it very likely that people will cut ties with you throughout your life."

antidiet,fqrdykf,t3_gki6gd,1589582487.0,"It’s commonly referred to as “orthorexia”, an unhealthy obsession with eating “healthy” foods. It’s an easy trap to fall into when you’re trying to “eat clean”. The concept of clean eating demonizing a lot of food and basically perpetuates the morality we associate with it (we’re “bad” if we eat a cookie, but “good” if we eat celery). And many people don’t realize that their obsession with “clean” foods is disordered eating because we’re told that it’s good.

And exercise addiction is rarely talked about, which is frustrating. I had an addiction to exercise when I was in my late teens because it was the only way to maintain the size I felt I had to be. I would come home from school and do half an hour of sit-ups and run on the treadmill for hours every single day and feel awful about myself if I didn’t do it. I would also punish my eating with more exercise. It was very unhealthy, especially mentally."

PlusSize,fqr22k9,t3_gkewdh,1589576147.0,"The problem isn’t you, it’s our culture of misogyny and diet obsession that makes women believe their worth is determined by the size of their bodies. We internalize these messages about ourselves and let our self esteem plummet. This is why even a lot of straight sized women lack body confidence; it’s usually not actually about the size we are, but that we’ve learned to perceive our bodies as never good enough. I’m sure you’re MUCH more than just the size of your body, yet the fact that you’ve gained weight is causing you a self esteem crisis. I know the concept of body positivity is a hard one to wrap your head around when you’ve been internalizing these messages your whole life. You don’t have to love your body every day, no one does. But disconnecting your body from your self worth is incredibly helpful when it comes to your happiness. Then you won’t have to live your life thinking you can only be happy if you’re at X weight.

Also, I would definitely encourage you to stop avoiding your friends and their life events because of your weight gain. 1) Hardly anyone will care, people are much more concerned about their own issues and honestly who cares if one or two people say, “She’s put on weight” behind your back. Those comments say way more about them than they do about you. And 2) You can’t get this time back. This is your life and you have to live it, regardless of your size. You won’t look back when you’re old and think, “Wow, I’m really glad I avoided making memories with my friends and family because they would have seen the weight I gained.”"

PlusSize,fqmzpke,t1_fqmv421,1589486228.0,"I agree, I don’t know why our society thinks we have a license to make comments about other people’s bodies. It’s really pretty presumptuous and possibly rude when you think about it. Like you said, no one knows why someone’s body is changing. 

I think about several years ago when Christina Aguilera put out new music and was on The Voice. She was a larger size than the last time she was really in the public eye and people crucified her for it. I saw so many articles and internet comments about “how dare she dress like she’s still a size 2” and “why did she let herself go?” and other such ignorance. Then she lost weight (which I still think was semi-forced by The Voice, since Kelly Clarkson also lost weight after she became a judge on the show) and there were tons of articles about “her transformation”. I just remember thinking, “How exhausting it must be to be out there, just trying to do your job and make your music as an artist, and all people can fixate on is the size of your body.” And what’s happening with Adele right now reminds me of that."
PlusSize,fqmyeme,t3_gjrk56,1589485608.0,"I’m not personally upset by her comments because she’s said tone-deaf things in the past and I’m not surprised. But her comments illustrate a problematic narrative that gets spread around: that larger women who say they’re ok with their bodies are lying. I see this as a criticism of body positivity sometimes. That it’s an excuse for women to stay fat and hide their unhappiness behind fake confidence. When really it’s that body positivity is a safe haven for those who are trying to recover from a lifetime of self-loathing based solely on what their body looks like. A lot of people in the community are at different stages of acceptance. But there are plenty of women, like myself, who have made peace with their bodies and definitely aren’t crying in bed at night over it like Sharon is suggesting. You can have real confidence and real love for your body at any size."

BeautyGuruChatter,fpwlp4o,t1_fpvu8la,1588965663.0,"Not just “thyroid issues”, thyroid removal for cancer treatment is another level. Hormone imbalances can change what your body considers a surplus of calories and your thyroid is the number one thing in your body that controls how quickly it burns through calories. So while previously someone had a normal BMR/RMR for their age/sex, removing (or having a growth on) key hormone producers can change that. It’s why people with cortisol issues, like a pituitary tumor, gain weight rapidly. So yes, a person could still theoretically avoid weight gain by staying under a certain number of calories, but that number could be very low compared to a person of their same age and sex. Which gets complicated for women of “child-bearing age”, because eating under a low number of calories can cause menstruation cycles to cease."

After exhausting all the options of trying to find her owners, we just took her in ourselves and it was very clear she was used to being an indoor cat.

It bugs me when people criticize her now for not being able to sing songs in the original key that she recorded when she was in her early twenties.

popheads,fpn3s0j,t3_ge0068,1588749272.0,"My husband loves all kinds of genres of music, pop included. We tend to mostly go to pop concerts together; we’ve seen Gaga, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, Janet Jackson and others (yes, we’re in our thirties). When he talks to people about going to a concert, often times they’re like, “Oh, your wife is dragging you to that, huh?” and he has to tell them no, that he genuinely enjoys the artist’s music. He’s a creative type, grew up playing a couple different instruments, and just generally doesn’t care about what’s “socially acceptable” for men to do, so I’m sure his apathy about appearing masculine enough has a lot to do with his open taste in music. We actually “argue” about Ariana; he loves her and I don’t.

We often talk about how sexist it is that a lot of men won’t listen to music by women because they think it’s “gay” and the only value they give to female artists is if they think they’re hot. I think that’s why record labels and producers put a lot of pressure on women in music to be sexy and make sexualized music videos because “we have to get the men interested somehow!” There’s a moment in Gaga’s “5 Foot 2” documentary where she says men have so much power in the record industry and that whenever they wanted her to be sexy, she always put some weird spin on it so that she could still be true to herself.

I will say that I think I’m happily married because we were together for 6 years before we got married and had lived together for 4 of those. We *really* knew each other, had honed our communication skills as a couple, and didn’t make excuses when things were occasionally rocky (no, you’re not fighting a lot because you’re both “so passionate”, you’re fighting because there’s a problem and you both need to fix it or move on).

It’s a disturbing scene where her maid can hear her screaming in agony from it. It had never occurred to me that sex was painful until that point. From then on I was trying to figure out if that was normal and I ended up reading some “first time” experiences online, which seemed to confirm that yes, it could really hurt.

Both she and I are fat, in our early thirties, and anti-diet. Meanwhile, I have a thin friend who has had three miscarriages and the doctors don’t know why. I also have two thin friends with PCOS, which some people swear is an “obesity-related” disease that can be almost cured with weight loss. It’s just not as cut and dry as people like to think it is when it comes to pregnancy and weight. Everyone is different."
introvert,fpfp047,t3_gcz6ot,1588578339.0,"We have a guy like this in our neighborhood. He gets a little drunk and sits outside in his driveway, talking on the phone. Every time my husband and I walk by on our evening walks, he talks to us, usually a joke that only sort of makes sense because he’s inebriated. He’s one of the only people in our neighborhood that’s around our age, most people here are 45+. So that may be why he likes to talk to us, but it gets awkward after the second time around!"

namenerds,fpcdjzw,t3_gcj7o6,1588496494.0,"I am, but have just always been obsessed with names. My mom kept the baby naming book someone gave her on our bookshelf when I was a kid and I looked at it all the time, completely fascinated by the meanings and spellings. I even used the book to name my Barbie dolls in my very elaborate stories of their lives (they ended up with names like Kylene, Raina, and Cassandra). My husband and I talked about possible baby names earlier in our lives, when we thought our apathy about having kids was just because we were 20 and everyone told us we would change our minds. Now we’re in our mid-thirties and still feel the same. But we’ve had plenty of fur babies to name, the most recent being our first cat. She’s a ginger girl we named Mimi."

It doesn’t fit well anymore and I just don’t feel compelled to get it resized or buy a new one. I’ve had other women be like, “Oh, an excuse for an upgrade!” so many times and I just can’t see spending money on that at this point in our lives. We’re in our 30s and have been together a long time, I’m not proving anything to anyone and I’d rather take a nice trip or redo something in our home than plunk down thousands of dollars for a ring. Honestly, I’d tell him not to buy one in the first place if I had a do over!"

PlusSize,fp0ntkj,t3_galzhs,1588213058.0,"I had to leave the PCOS subreddit a little while ago because I couldn’t take it anymore. The diet talk was bad enough, but what I really couldn’t deal with was all the self-loathing posts about “I hate this disease because it has stolen my body” and “I hate myself because I have a belly pouch that won’t budge.” It was so negative and absolutely not the reason I joined. I’ve always had a larger body, with the exception of the few years of disordered eating I went through, so it was hard on my mental health to see so many people disparage a body type I live in, regardless of PCOS. Honestly, it started to make me feel like a lot of people there believed the *worst* thing about the disease was the weight gain, and not the other myriad of symptoms it comes with.

The keto vultures there are out of control too. I actually started seeing people suggesting that vegan and vegetarian diets helped them get downvoted. The keto cult there just has a hard time accepting that it’s not for everyone."
PlusSize,fp0nbh0,t1_fp0il5p,1588212753.0,OMG I know exactly the person you’re talking about and it’s so annoying! I actually started purposefully going into the nutrition and diet threads to see how long it would take me to find a comment by her.
antidiet,fozsist,t3_gafzpw,1588196098.0,"100% yes. I have seen so many people who start out all, “This is my new lifestyle, I’m doing this for my health!” with programs like Noom and then quit because they only lost a couple pounds in a few weeks so clearly “It wasn’t working.” Like, which is it, is this all about your health and how good eating this way is for you or is it just about the number on the scale and getting thin? That’s the problem with intentional weight loss and diets. People think they’re only eating nutritious foods to lose weight and they ignore the other benefits it may have. It’s all about the outside and not at all about the inside. People could be so much happier if they just stopped the food obsessing, focused on mostly eating things that made them feel good, and went to therapy for their body image issues. But of course then they’d have to give up the idea of having their “dream body” and so many just can’t do that."
AskReddit,foxhsyt,t1_fovfv5m,1588144419.0,"Me too. I was an only child who relied on my imagination for entertainment quite a bit, so I was enthralled by the world the characters create for themselves.

Youniqueamua,foxcgiw,t1_fox6qaa,1588139866.0,"It’s usually an issue with staining, meaning if they get inside your eye, it can stain the sclera. So the whites of your eyes could be a semi-permanent pink color! Reds and pinks are the common culprits, so if you see a red or pink shade as eyeshadow, it’s probably made by mixing multiple other colors together instead of using a straight lake dye pigment."

nfl,foq54zk,t1_foph2fa,1587983357.0,"It’s sad that ESPN doesn’t realize that the vast majority of women who are tuning into the NFL draft are not the same ones that watch the Hallmark channel. And they’re not going to convert any non-fans just because they told a sad story about a player’s dad. Let’s be real, non-fans are probably barely paying attention, the draft is not that exciting when you have zero idea what significance anything has. If their strategy was to appeal more to women in general by focusing less on football and more on emotional tragedies, that’s just as annoying to me as men who ask me to “name three players on my team that aren’t the QB” whenever I say I’m a football fan. It’s insulting."

I’m already sitting there thinking about how much of a bummer it is that he’s not here to watch the draft with me and then I have to sit through dozens of “So-and-so’s father tragically passed away from a freak farming accident the night of his son’s homecoming game” with sad music playing in the background.

So every search I did was like “anxiety muscle aches” and “anxiety stomach problems” and “anxiety twitches”. It helped it become ingrained in me that anxiety can be the cause of so many things and distracted me from wanting to Googling everything else. I still had to exercise some control sometimes when the urge to look something up would strike, but after awhile I was able to stop Googling all together."
