AskLGBT,fr67s6m,t3_gmojxv,1589921402.0,"Well, ace and allos CAN have a working relationship. However, that generally implies polyamory or abstinence for the allo person.  


What you should do is have that discussion with her. Talk about her boundaries and what she's willing to do/not do. Some ace are willing to have sex or if they're not, they might be willing to do some sexual acts.  But then you'll have to see if that satisfy you or not.  


You have to understand that she'll never be a fan of sex. You have to accept it, and accept the fact you won't have the same sexual life as allos couples (less sex, some acts are a no-no, etc). If you can't accept that, then it's better to just move on.

First of all, I'm sorry there's so many crabs in the comments. Some people here, sadly, don't want to get better and they'll just try to drag you down.  


If you look in this sub for testimonies of incels that have left the blackpill behind, you will find many - and you don't need to ''ascend'' for that. It's hard, because the blackpill is kind of like a drug - it's addictive even though it hurts you.   


I know what it says right now seems like the truth, but it isn't. Depression, stress, anxiety, they twist the way we see the world and makes it appear darker than it is. We interpret everything in a bad way. Maybe these women didn't have such expressions on their faces. Maybe you're not as ugly as you think.  But mental health issues will convince you that it was that. Now, I'm not denying the experiences you had - I'm sure a lot of people were assholes to you. But mental health issues tend to exagerate the problem and expand it to everyone.   


I'm so sorry you got bullied in high school. Teenagers suck man.   


You know, in reality, looks don't matter as much as you think either. I mean sure, if you just want to get laid, then looks will matter a lot. But in reality, most people don't end up with their ''ideal'' physical partner. Because they fall in love, and sometimes the person you fall in love with had nothing to do with that you think you wanted. Short people, fat people, handicapped people, many of these people find love - that's just a fact.   


Of course the blackpill, wanting to kill every hope in you, will try to convince you that these women are just with these people for ''money'' or all cheat on them. I hope you realize that's not how life works and that's not realistic. It's just a way of stopping you from seeing that there is hope. The blackpill is made to keep you down and imprison you.  


I get, though, that it can be harder for these people to find love. Especially if you have social difficulties. But you DO NOT have to get through this alone. Try meditation. Self-therapy. Therapy with a professional. See you doctor. I know it's hard to motivate yourself to seek help because you're in a dark place, but it's the first step to get better. I know you can do it.  


Start by leaving all incels plateforms, all ex-incels will tell you that it's the first and most important step of all. You'll never get better as long as you stay on these addictive plateforms.   


Good luck. There is still hope."
IncelExit,fr2l9xt,t3_gmawf5,1589839280.0,"I know I'm going to get called a liar, but oh well.  


I like chubby men. Like, what you'd call fat men. Muscular has never been my thing. Slightly muscular is okay, but anything over that is too much for my personal taste. I don't care at all about height, thought to be honest I've never met a man shorter than me since I'm 4''9.   


I'm aware that my personal taste do not represent the majority, however there are still many women out there who feel like this too. Dunno if that helps.  


And if I look at the women around me - most have not ended up with their physical ideal. They fell in love ''at random'' and ended up with that person instead, because in the end what's physical is not that important once you know and love someone. Though, if you just want to get laid, of course physical appearance will matter a lot.  


As for ''gymcels'', it depends. Some of them still don't get laid because they're too shy or insecure to talk to women.  Some - though they'll tell you it's not true - give up a weird vibe - I'm talking about the creepy, hateful or misogynistic ones.  It can be many things."

These people will gaslight you, guilt you, shame you, use you as a doormat, and so on. The only way of getting rid of them eventually is to tell them to f*ck off. Then they'll react exactly like OP's aunt - act all offended like you had no right to do this. But this will actually be the first time they will suffer some consequences to their actions. Because these people COUNT on the fact you'll HAVE to stay polite, while they know they can just insult you again and again without you saying anything. You have to break the circle at one point.

What you're saying works in heated arguments with strangers or friends, it's a good advice for these kind of situations. I 100% agree with you then, it's better to stay respectful and polite.

But not in abusive and toxic relationship. 

It's just like parents telling their child to ''be nice'' to their bullies and they will stop. That DOES NOT work. It's not how life works. 

Also I was talking about this thread, plus other threads since this is a repost. Most people are on OP's side, just read the comments.

And are YOU listening to yourself? '' How can you be certain it's the aunt's fault''? She literally attacked first, and she literally attacked OP calling her stupid and implying her mother was ashamed of her, all of that for something OP HAS NO CONTROL OVER - her sexual orientation.

Without going that far, we know that depression and anxiety are known to distort the way we think people see us. 

Of course it's not always the case - people can be in abusive households or have toxic friends. But if you're convinced society in general treats you badly just because you haven't had sex, that is not rational."

IncelExit,fqy4d88,t1_fqxyk4c,1589742387.0,"That's a to-go statement that doesn't really mean anything. What reality? Not everyone has a shitty reality. Some do, and that can cause depression. Some don't, and still have depression because depression can be hereditary and have no concrete cause other than medical/biological.

It's simply a fact that depression distort reality and the person's views of the world. It's literally a biological fact since your brain is altered by the wrong amount of chemicals. That's why people with depression are all deeply convinced that they'll never get better - even thought statistically a lot of people with depression/suicidal people do get better."

I hope one day you realize. I sincerely do."
IncelExit,fqxw430,t1_fqwf6aq,1589738760.0,At 21??? You're clearly delusional. Nobody in its right state of mind can logically believe that. Oh boy... What the incel mentality does on someone.
IncelExit,fqxvsxi,t3_gljivs,1589738630.0,"Yes you can. You've already made a huge step by aknowledging you should. You're right, the incel mentality brings you down.   


And nothing you believe about yourself is true. The way YOU feel about yourself is not the way everyone feels about you.  


You seem to be in a depression, friend, and depression is well-known for twisting our sense of reality and our opinions. Please don't believe it, it's lying."

Nice drawing!"
IncelExit,fqw8zgc,t1_fqv9ia9,1589696341.0,"Why would it be ''over''? The mere idea appals me. Like, you're not dead. Older people do date. Just rationally, of course there's still time as long as you're alive. I'm not saying you WILL find someone, but you can't realistically say it'll never happen."
IncelExit,fqw8s7l,t3_gkzhsp,1589696163.0,"Dude... Shit reading your post I though you were like 40. YOU'RE JUST 21. I know it seems like you sooo old right now, but believe me in the future you'll think about that and smile. Stop putting so much pressure on you, you're so freaking young. Nothing is ''ending'', that's bullshit from the incel mentality to keep you in their sect. Calm down. Everything will be ok."
