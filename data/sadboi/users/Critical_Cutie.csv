The point of my story, it's not easy. You'll think of every excuse possible not to leave. But what helped me a lot the second time is we had a date set, while we didnt the first time.

School could be a good idea to learn some tips and tricks of the trade but is is definitely NOT essential. And just like in the industry there will be a some, if not a lot,, of rejection, but definately dont let that get you down! FAIL = First Attempt In Learning after all. 

Just keep your head high! I got lucky with a supportive family, but just think - do your family watch movies? TV? Listen to music? Draw or paint? Or look do anything that involves others going through a creative process? Just remind them that they would not be able to do some of the things they enjoy without actors and such. Yes, you are probably not going to become RDJ famous, but if you want to act, act! Dont let anyone hold you back. And at least you know if you change your mind or dont enjoy it as much as you thought, you have your buisness degree to fall back on, maybe that will make your family comfortable? 

Good luck in your acting journey!"

We played a few sessions of D&D together online with a group of friends. They were all going to MCM Comic Con London May. While I was planning on going to the October one I wasnt sure if I had the money to attend the May one. One of my friends/players conviced me and our DM was looking for someone to share a hotel with anyway so on a whim I decided to go.

It was basically love at first sight, but at the time we didnt know it yet (and it wasnt just for looks as we had became good friends playing D&D). I was sitting with one of our friends and he didnt know what any of us looked like since we only played online. I saw him wandering around looking for something. I thought he was cute but it didnt click it could have been him. His end of the story which he told me was he was too nervous to sit beside me cause I was too beautiful (which I still dont believe xD). Finally he sent a discord message asking where we were and I replied. He walked over and asked ""Is this Wardtortle's (our DMs discord name) group"" I smiled at his adorable face and said ""It is. Hi I'm Sam (My D&D characters name)"" he said ""Im Avron"" (his characters name if you couldnt guess). 

We basically spend the whole weekend together, we went back to the hotel I was staying at after a meet while the others explored and went to the pub inside it. We talked for ages (well I talked and didnt let him get a word in xD) before the others got there. He bought me a drink, and me having never been hit on before, tried to pay him back. Oops! 

He helped me find my way through the underground back to my train, going out of his way just to help me. From the moment he left the station we started messaging each other, my first message being ""I FOUND A SEAT"" (I have a weird love for sitting on the floor and before he left the station he told me to find an actual seat that wasnt the floor). Then when I was on the train home, then every moment after. There wasnt a moment we werent texting. A month later he asked me on a date. I said yes. Our first date was a voice call. The rest is history. 

Now we try to see each other every month. Its a tad easier being Scotland to England but it doesnt make the distance any less real. I love him so much ❤
