I weigh like 180 to 190 on average, I think at 150 I would look ripped but lose a lot of muscle mass. People probably could see I'm somewhat muscular but they wouldn't tell easily until I take my shirt off. Who knows though, the lowest I've weighed after puberty was 165. My ideal weight for my body is probably like 175 if I were to say."

AskReddit,fc5whn7,t3_ega9qc,1577467371.0,"1. You don't go from zero to hero in a month or two like the way most before and after pictures state. It takes a lot of dedication and it's a lifestyle.

2. More is not always better, most don't workout enough anyway so it shouldn't be a problem... But I know when I started the gym I worked out til I dropped. 

3. Weight doesn't matter as much as the mirror, I was fatter when I was 165 pounds then I am now at 190. (Granted it was a 3 year difference)

4. After noobie gains, you plateau after a point. I was gaining strength fast when I started and muscle... In bench I started with getting 135 for 7 reps my first time ever and over time I got 225 for 1 rep, then 2, then 3, then 4 and eventually got to 10. My strength didn't get much higher after that.  Also, strength changes based on the day and a variety of factors. Also, muscle growth slows down the more years you train. If it wasn't this way, people who train for years would be like 300 pounds of raw muscle and that would be normal.

5. Genetics count a lot, but don't blame it and use it as an excuse not to train hard. 

6. Don't do machines, isolation movements and run 5 miles then decide to benchpress. Compound movements first, then isolation movements, and if you want to THEN cardio. You can do a light walk before lifting weights though to warm up."
