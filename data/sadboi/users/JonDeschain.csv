securityguards,f2drjz6,t1_f2dptwm,1570162444.0,"One of my older uncles is the same. Got into security, it fit his personality, only worked at places that knew what they were doing, found his way into working at correctional facilities. He did that until he retired a few years back. 

He told me there's a lot of shit jobs out there, but a lot of great jobs too. Just gotta do your due diligence and know where you draw the line at in terms of how your employers treat you."

securityguards,f1gk0k4,t1_f1g8o8l,1569468994.0,"Thanks for your reply bro :) 

In 2020, when I'm done taking care of a relative, I'll be giving security work a try, so I've been doing my research. I'll be taking your advice on floating. Mostly I want a warm-body site if bossman can swing that for me. 

When I was 18 working at Target, I felt really bad for the entrance security guard =/ Just standing there all shift. He was nice, always nodded at me, and helped me with the heavier carry-outs even if he didn't have to."
