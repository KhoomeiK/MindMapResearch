OCD,fmju64w,t3_fvncwi,1586137813.0,"Well I got lost a bit and didn't get what the question is but: 

>What does it mean if a thought wasn’t intrusive but you didn’t like it anyways, like it was unwanted, and you suddenly remember the thought long after having it and it starts to scare you? 

It means that your OCD kicks in. The overall style of your post and the post itself seems like a part of your obsession.

I can kind of relate to second part of your post. I had a few short episodes of worrying about being homosexual. Being afraid of it made me question and analyze the way I looked at/thought of men. To the point I tried not to look in the eyes of guys in YouTube videos.

Thought ""what if I'm gay?"" --> wondering if this can be true --> checking my thoughts and behavior for anything that would suggest it --> but this checking includes wondering if this is attractive for me, so to check this you need to think about things X as attractive for a moment and see how does it make you feel --> but that is exactly what I feared and I'm starting 

So!
Doubt, doubt, doubt...
Fear, fear, fear...
Checking, thinking...
OCD in all it's ""glory"".

I got through it and I know it can be of little help but I can tell you this: all of this doesn't mean you're what you fear you may be. 

Note that all of this comes from a fear of being something. That fear is a proof you're not."
