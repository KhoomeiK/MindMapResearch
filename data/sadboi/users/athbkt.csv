depression,fnyx3p7,t3_g4jbup,1587378928.0,"Can’t say I dont relate. I’ve been typing and deleting a post like this in this subreddit or r/Anxiety. I don’t and can’t wake up in the morning and can’t sleep. I hate work but I have to pretend like I’m keen to learn and am enjoying this opportunity. Every action takes so much effort from me, and it feels like I’m so much slower and inefficient than my peers making me sink into even greater depths of dark thoughts."
OverwatchUniversity,fmvzj6d,t3_fxq4qd,1586435840.0,"Love this a lot as a support player. When people automatically thank their healers after a game or say good heals, recognise the rezes and damage boosts as mercy all really makes my day until some asshole comes and ruins it."
Anxiety,fldpfvm,t3_fnuncn,1585069137.0,hey that’s me!! And you can’t get out of bed the next morning leaving you feeling like an absolute grogger the entire day... then the cycle repeats. Maybe I’m just not meant for life
offmychest,fk7syvm,t3_fgx1ww,1583943040.0,"Highly relatable. Sometimes interactions like this (and frankly many others who am I kidding) makes me wish there was the Black Mirror function to mute and block people HAHAHHAA

Overwatch,fixmsit,t3_f9firv,1582823219.0,"I think in general this mode would reward good game sense and mechanics especially if the tank picked is an off tank without any team protection/shielding capabilities (ie. hog and ball); One can’t conveniently hide behind shields. As overwatch was my first FPS game, it really took some time to learn to do the basics like take natural cover, strafe especially when there’s a sniper, pick smart fights. If someone were new to the game and this was their first interaction, it might be a difficult start (or maybe I’m a slow learner). I think it would be a fun alternative game mode, but maybe not the default quick play/comp mode for me. (Or perhaps it just takes time to let the 1-3-2 structure grow on me)"
Overwatch,fhp48cd,t3_f4724h,1581781548.0,HAHAHA I relate to this on an atomic level as a healer main ++  when everyone rushes in recklessly and starts dying then complains that you’re never healing them :’)
