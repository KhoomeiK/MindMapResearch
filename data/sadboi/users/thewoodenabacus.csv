Gifted,fqi5fda,t3_gieemn,1589390447.0,"Hey! 

I resonate a lot with your story. I am happy to chat if you want to sorta vent or hear about my experience. 

But I also had to have a grammar tutor and tbh she is the reason I am a writer today. Happy to explain whatever grammar stuff I can. In the meantime:

An adverb is any word that *adds* information about how a *verb* happened. So if you walked, that‚Äôs one thing. But if you walked quickly, that quick info is the adverb. It tells you more about how the action happened. In English these words usually end in -ly but not always. 

A semi colon is almost like the link between train cars, if trains were sentences. They tell the reader that the train car (the sentence we are talking about) is linked to this next one that‚Äôs following, but pay attention because there is a difference between them, they are not the same thing. They should be connected (maybe because they are in contrast to one another, maybe because they are so similar, maybe for humor or sarcasm-depends on the writer‚Äôs choice) but they are linked by this ;

The other thing to think about is the amount of rest time a semicolon indicates. To my knowledge, the order of rest time from shortest to longest is like this:

,

.

;

:

- (this dash seems to format oddly when I submit the comment, but it‚Äôs meant to be a short dash)


‚Äî 

If you want to tinker with the pacing and rhythm of your writing, you tinker with these elements primarily, along with where you break your paragraphs. It‚Äôs a fun way to make your writing more musical. 

And cool fact, the last dashes have names! The en dash is the shorter one - it‚Äôs about as long as the width of the letter n. 

The longer one is a much more attention grabbing and lengthy pause, and is an em dash because it‚Äôs about as long as the width of the letter m. 


Life will unfold with and without regard to your IQ but your heart and goodness will always matter. The race is not against your test scores, it‚Äôs against your evolving sense of what matters and who you want to become ‚Äî grammatically or otherwise. I promise you‚Äôll be ok üíú"
Dogtraining,fqflwgx,t3_gig1le,1589327262.0,"This reminds me of something I read years ago in The Art of Raising a Puppy, and an experience my family had with a foster lab. The dog was bred to be a seeing eye dog, but in the demand for bomb detecting dogs after 9/11, she was entering weekend training for more militant police work. After the first couple of weekends we got back a puppy who was more and more relieved to see us and increasingly shaken, and after about the fourth visit she was a broken dog.  Our protests got my mom howled at by a military officer to shut up and mind our business and being invited to stop volunteering for the program. It was awful. The dog‚Äôs temperament was meant for close human relationships but her training was meant for an aloof machine. It was terrible. Apparently many of these dogs failed out of the program and were now also ineligible for seeing eye dog work. 

I say this because there are certain dogs who will have a much more gentle and easily broken personality. When this is violated, and depending on the way it is violated, it really becomes a matter of serious PTSD. The comment about contacting the shelter is spot on, and in equal measure so is the one about medication. She may need chemical help calming the noise in her emotions so she can begin to bond and trust you. 

It may also be worth considering that she may really need her forever home now. If you do all this work to get her trusting you and then she is handed off to a new home, it may regress her and make the trusting process that much harder. Perhaps consider her yours for the foreseeable future? 

And a last little thing that may be helpful, may not be: sleep in a t-shirt and put it in her kennel with her food on top of it. Make sure your scent and her food can be positively associated. 

Best of luck :)"

MakeupRehab,fpa4rnm,t3_gc8kta,1588440796.0,"I heard a talk about how a habit has three parts:

A stimulus
An action
A reward


Spend some time figuring out where you can substitute and redirect this pattern. If your reward is a sense of creative expression, can you substitute something else to get the same feeling?

If the stimulus is anxiety that needs a creative outlet, can you redirect that into a different action? 

If the action is because you have easy access, saved logins and saved payment methods, maybe remove those. Force yourself to type in the login. Type in the credit card number. And put a post it on the credit card that asks ‚Äú Is this the best use of my money?‚Äù

Sometimes I keep a tally to make it a rewarding game of monitoring my impulses. For every time I catch myself thinking I want to buy something, that‚Äôs one tally. Each is worth a dollar I get to spend on something else that is meaningful in a better way for me. So maybe you think about buying makeup 30 times a week. That would be $30 you can set aside for a trip or something, or even savings, and it‚Äôs still waaaaaay less than what you would have spent buying makeup.

schizoaffective,fnk5onj,t3_g21u2r,1587015724.0,I was hoping someone here might be able to help someone without this condition understand why this happens? Used to know someone with this mental condition and he would routinely go weeks without any hygiene. Then he would go through phases of being meticulously clean. It was hard for me to understand.

Sorry I don‚Äôt have the specific answer to this problem but hope you get to the solution soon!"

CleaningTips,fn7pthp,t3_g01tq3,1586725192.0,"If the existing recommendations about a magic eraser don‚Äôt work, it may be because the dye from the paper has leached unto the material. 

In that case, bleach the entire surface and stay close by to check that it isn‚Äôt doing damage by sitting on too long. I recommend bleaching the whole thing so that any other discoloration comes up at the same time and the result isn‚Äôt splotchy."
