SuicideWatch,ffa4wog,t1_ff93d6b,1579727947.0,"I have no idea. I think maybe he feels too overwhelmed by what he feels are his shortcomings? 

Well all of us in this world have problems. I'm currently going through a bankruptcy, for instance, which is a lot of stress. I cant afford to move back home, and sometimes I feel like I can barely pay the bills I have right now. Being in a state 24 hours drive away from my family with brand spanking new friends (because I'm so new here) is also weighing on me harder at some times than others. The stress gets to me and makes me irritable, so I feel bad seeing people when I'm in an irritable mood. Usually I just like to be alone in the dark with the tv going so I can sit and cry or be sad or irritable while I'm alone cuddling with my cats. I guess being alone helps me recharge and express some of my emotions without them affecting others."

SuicideWatch,ff4ff1b,t1_ff40u1d,1579562312.0,"I feel like, since he has been doing better, that he might think I'm over-worried about him if I keep pushing him or suggesting to him that he needs professional help. The topic has only ever come up once or twice cuz usually he doesnt like to go to those discussions or thoughts in his head. 

Sometimes my feelings change about going through with plans because of whatever mood I've got going on because of my feelings about other issues and I would rather spend time alone to clear my head than go through with plans while I'm not in a good or social mood"

SuicideWatch,ff094ly,t1_fet0l9y,1579466532.0,"I'd feel like I was asking too much or I'd be afraid he would think I was being pushy. 

I think that would be good. Sometimes I'm the one who's not in the mood to do things though, including when I have already made plans and then when it comes closer to the plan time, I dont feel like going. And I dont want him to be looking forward to hanging out with me and then I dont feel up to it and disappoint him"
SuicideWatch,felqo17,t1_fejgzs0,1579228587.0,"I dont think he has ever talked to any hotlines, as he hasnt mentioned anything like that at all. 

He chose to not even respond to the invitation of the guy's night :( the mutual friend told me he never got a response."
SuicideWatch,feeciz5,t1_fee0hdz,1579030942.0,"I think that's exactly what he wants. He has said he knows he should talk to a counselor or psychologist about it but outside of that, I dont think he has followed up with that idea. 

I encouraged our mutual friend who texted me about him to invite him for a guy's night. Other than that, I dont know who else to encourage because I'm still really new to this area and he has grown up here so he knows way more people than I do

Thank you!!"
SuicideWatch,feb1bbc,t1_fe4u01c,1578954467.0,"I'm not sure either he or I can accurately put into words what he would like them to do or say. It is more of an empathetic response that he needs, I think; like when he talks to me, he knows that I know what he's going through because I have been there myself. 

I think what helps him most is that he is able to express his thoughts without being judged or pitied. The last time it came up, he sort of just spoke less and then decided he just wanted to sit and watch a movie with me. After that, he went home and I'm not sure what else happened at that point. Just that he was still feeling down the next day. 

He asked me to promise him I wouldnt tell anyone anything he has told me, and I promised him. One of our mutual friends asked me if he was okay, and I simply said that he was having a rough time, and that I hope he came through it, but nothing more. I'm not quite sure anything more at that point wouldnt have been breaking my promise. And I feel like if I were to ask someone we know to check on him, he might wonder how much I told that person. That same mutual friend offered to invite him for a guy's night and I did mention I think that would be a great idea, and the invitation was extended. He didnt answer, though, and apparently never did because it didnt happen. 


Great news though is that he is doing much better now, starting two days after the night he ranted to me and we watched a movie!! He was laughing and joking with me over text and I told him how happy I was that he is doing better. He seems very content at this point, and I'll take that wherever I can with him :)"
SuicideWatch,fdps2q2,t1_fdp6iu6,1578638311.0,"From what he has told me, he has talked to them before but all they do is tell him ""we're here for you"" and ""it'll be okay."" He and I talked about how that really doesnt help him and he doesnt want to open up if that's what they're going to say, and nothing more. 

When we talk, I let him decide if and when he wants to discuss this, but when he is in a mood to discuss it, it becomes more of a rant where it's almost as if I'm not even there to interact. I think that part is what worries me the most, because he goes down the rabbit hole in his head and nothing I say reaches him. 

I sort of feel like it would be asshole-ish to call the police and say ""I'm concerned he will hurt himself""  even though that is a true statement. He would know it was me, I think, and i want him to be safe but I dont want him thinking I overreacted."
