depression,ews4tq5,t3_cpidz8,1565720201.0,"I never thought of it this way, but that makes complete sense. Like others have said, ""home"" in this case seems to be (for me, at least. YMMV.) more of a sense of stability and security that you're just associating with home. If a physical home doesn't fully embody this feeling then even when you're in that place you will be yearning for that associated feeling."

So, something that helped me A LOT with this was a combination of a usage tracker app (tracks how many times you wake or unlock your phone, app usage times, etc.) and the grayscale display mode (on my phone it was under Accessibility, for colorblind people). The usage tracker gave me metrics to work with and the grayscale mode made looking at my phone less ""rewarding"".

This worked great until my subconscious mind figured out it could justify turning the color back on and then not turn it back off. At that point I used Tasker (for Android... I'm sure iPhones have something similar) to toggle the grayscale back on every time I unlocked my phone (or whenever the screen dimmed... I don't remember what I ultimately decided on). That way, if I needed colors for some reason I could toggle it off and then next time I picked up my phone it would be bland and lifeless again.

Also, rearranging my home screen/launcher occasionally helps because my hand can't just go into that autopilot mode where one minute I'm standing in the kitchen and the next thing I know it's an hour later, my phone is in my hand with one of many time-hole apps open, and I'm left wondering ""How did I get here?"""
