antiMLM,fhht10y,t3_f2qzcg,1581611180.0,"Not sure if this fits here, but wanted to discuss Beach Body being super toxic in the context of body image and exercise shame. Within the last two days alone, I’ve been told by my Beach Body ‘coach’ cousin to “get moving” after *accidentally* responding to her Instagram poll and also witnessed her sister (also a ‘coach’) talking on Instagram about her elementary school age daughter writing the words “I am fat” on her own body. I’m incredulous because I feel like both of these women come from this place of self importance that they’re somehow encouraging everyone in our family to “live their best life” when in reality all they’re doing is being super aggressive about diet and exercise. Anybody else feel this way? Am I being overly sensitive? Is this a personal issue or a Beach Body issue?"
Anxiety,fg75izf,t3_exa3fv,1580584496.0,This is the hardest part of having anxiety for me. It’s worst during the come down period after a panic attack because I feel like when I’m in a state of panic that’s when everything feels SO REAL but then the second I start to relax I feel the need to almost start gaslighting myself like wow you were just being so insane how could you have acted like that why are you so crazy and the only person to ever actually validate the ‘realness’ of those anxious thought spirals has been my therapists. I feel like the fact that my loved ones have given me that “why are you being so crazy” reaction has really fueled that anger towards myself. The first thing I was ever taught in therapy is to question those anxious thoughts by finding evidence to support or deny your thought process but I think the problem is that with super deep patterns of automatic thoughts you already have an arsenal of reasons why what you’re feeling *seems* true. Sorry this is kind of rambling but I know exactly what you mean and it’s so upsetting and hard to deal with.

Anxiety,fag9x7h,t3_e92vp4,1576045179.0,"Was going through basically the same thing around the time you posted this. Have been just scrolling through this sub and r/depression and just trying to take solace in the fact that there’s lots of us struggling out here. I think something else to possibly consider is that maybe your boyfriend does care but simply doesn’t understand or isn’t in a place emotionally to empathize? I sometimes get caught up in the idea that my own partner ‘doesn’t care’ when in reality they just don’t have the capacity to be there for me or they just simply don’t know how. This shit is hard to understand even when you’re the person experiencing it, so it’s easy to see how it’s hard to understand from the outside looking in. Still, I know how lonely it feels. I hope things look up for you soon."
