mentalhealth,fqptfun,t3_gk5jst,1589553656.0,Same. It’s normal. I went through the same thing and my problems actually started to arise during middle school or preteen years. I finally told my mom around 7th grade what I was going through and she never seemed to understand or care. She would expect me to pray it away or “do a make-over” and my problems would magically go away. “Wrong!!!”. These problems started to get worse the older I got and until this day I’m still dealing with shit. But when I became an adult I seen therapists and psychiatrists and it was hard for me to explain myself to them. That’s why I’m not sure if I should see a therapist again or not.

raisedbynarcissists,fpjxdun,t1_fpjwekj,1588683426.0,Same. But with my mom. I’m not allowed to feel down or have any problems around her. If I look or mention anything about how I feel around her she’ll dismiss me and expect me to be positive every time I’m around her.
securityguards,fpjmn8k,t1_fpio9fw,1588674183.0,0500-2200 was a whole shift that they offered.
mentalhealth,fpiaimx,t1_fpi8os8,1588636941.0,Same. I felt like I’m my situation I’ve never gotten the support I needed to finish my education. If I mention anything about it to family all they do is tell me to forget about it and brush it under a rug. Growing up I spent most of my time in “Special classes” so right there I was almost limited my education and I felt like I haven’t been able to learn shit. I think it also caused me to be less independent. I wanted to go to college to make up for it and to prove that I can learn and work like everyone else. But now since I’ve been out of school I’ve felt like a stupid person and I have nothing to prove. This is part of what I try to explain to people but they don’t care to listen or understand. I also have family at the same time pressure me to find something and it’s just so hard for me to think about myself after years of feeling like my identity has been robbed. They don’t understand either how hard it is and they constantly come at me crazy whenever I mention that I struggle with things.
mentalhealth,fphijbs,t3_gdes4a,1588621894.0,I’m also 28 and been to college but didn’t graduate because I stopped going. I stopped going because I didn’t want to do the major I signed up for and I decided to take what I thought would be one semester off to figure out what I wanted to do. Since then I still can’t come up with anything and I feel like I didn’t accomplish anything good in life. Whenever I see people my age who graduated or if I see current college kids I start to get angry and I have regrets because didn’t stay in school. I also feel like most people my age understand and have somewhat of their lives together and I’m just behind. I really want to go back to school but I feel like it’s to late and I just hate myself for messing it up.

WeightLossAdvice,flhnyax,t3_folpy7,1585166232.0,I’ve been eating less than my calorie limit. I work overnight so I’m normally eating only for 1 or 2 meal courses during the day. I used to eat large meals during those times but now I just eat low calorie meals instead of something too high. I still eat out but I buy smaller meal sizes and keep calories low when I do. I usually will eat more on the weekends though for maintenance.  I’m trying to go back out running with my C25K app but I need to make some time to do it. Plus I want to learn some workout routines at home first. I wanted to start working out at home first before the shut down happened.
whatsbotheringyou,flhlktt,t1_flgt7qh,1585164976.0,It’s ok. Yes I know the feeling. I hate having nobody to talk to because of how they Would judge me. My family doesn’t listen to me at all. They just brush me off and dismiss me.

blackladies,fl8r2va,t1_fl8qhc5,1584930216.0,Thanks. I was so happy when I got back to work around that time and been having my own money since then. It felt good when I was able to have my independence and to shop for myself again.
blackladies,fl8pc72,t3_fn9x88,1584929028.0,I also have the same problem. I started putting on weight in my teens and when I hit my 20s it got worse. My mom would never say anything about my weight until now. mainly about how I eat even when I don’t eat much throughout the week or day. I’m usually at her house on the weekends and I don’t eat much during the week. She once told me that I should starve. I’m always getting comments about my thighs and butt. Sometimes my stomach but some people will pinch and poke like it’s funny. Being told I’m “big” from family. But when I moved in with my grandmother and aunt at 21 because I had no job and no place else I can afford to go they would say negative things because of my body. They would also body shame me when I wore certain clothes like leggings and skinny jeans and shorts. They would take me into plus size sections for clothes when I wasn’t that big. I just needed a simple size up. My aunt would say things about my hips and would tell me I wasn’t allowed to wear anything form fitting. The clothes fit me fine but they didn’t like how my shape was in my clothes and would say things like I was being whorish or a slut and men would stare if I wore those things. Eventually they stopped after my me and dad made them realize I was a grown woman. But I also hate when some family members think it’s ok to point out that I’ve gained weight or “putting on some”. It’s just rude.
securityguards,fl40wc2,t1_fl1dblw,1584803316.0,Right. I really be feeling like a vampire and a robot. I don’t feel as human as I used to either.

diet,fkvipw8,t3_fktzo7,1584570011.0,I’ve actually been dieting for weeks before the lockdown and I’m more concerned about the grocery stores running out of healthy food. I went Monday morning and the whole produce section was wiped out. Including the frozen vegetables and fruit. I’m trying to go back shopping but I’m afraid everything will still be empty by the time I come. But since I work overnight I’ve been eating very little since I sleep almost all day and I watch my calories with anything and learning portion sizes to stay under my calorie limit. I’m glad I’m still making progress though.
