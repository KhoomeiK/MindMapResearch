>KUALA LUMPUR: Kumpulan 11 bekas Ahli Parlimen PKR yang keluar daripada parti itu dan Pakatan Harapan (PH) bagi membentuk gabungan baharu, menegaskan mereka bukan pengkhianat seperti dituduh beberapa pihak.

>Sebaliknya, kumpulan itu mendakwa pihak yang berusaha mengubah Perdana Menteri di tengah-tengah penggal adalah pengkhianat sebenar kerana mementingkan kuasa berbanding melaksanakan dasar kerajaan.

>Dalam satu kenyataan bersama yang diketuai Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, tindakan mereka adalah perlu bagi menggagalkan konspirasi menjatuhkan Perdana Menteri, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad di tengah-tengah penggal."
