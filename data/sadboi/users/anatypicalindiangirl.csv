IWantToLearn,fqlrn7t,t3_gjg9vs,1589464757.0,"In my opinion, don't try to cook typical meat heavy recipes with meat replacement or try to go raw vegan. Those are some of the most sure shot ways to fail from what I have observed.

As someone from a traditional vegetarian community in India, vegetarian food is all I have ever eaten.

Don't try to search ""Indian vegetarian recipes"" or ""Vegan recipes"" or some variant of that. It would be difficult to find the simple authentic recipes under those search results that can be cooked easily and consumed on a regular basis while maintaining balanced nutrition.

Another important thing to ensure is to complete the nutrition; the macro and micro nutrients.

For desserts, look for 'eggless' recipes. Although you would find milk recipes rather than vegan ones there.
You can try vegetable and other recipes from Aman Agarwal on Youtube. All his his recipes are vegetarian or vegan even though he doesn't mention it anywhere. You can also try Kabita's Kitchen. She has both vegetarian+vegan and non-vegetarian recipes. And both of them teach a lot of friendly easy to cook simple foods. You can also follow Cheap Lazy Vegan. As a meat eater turned vegan, she has better insight than me with the problems that come up in the process and how to deal with them.

As others have mentioned, Indian food is vegan/vegetarian friendly and have evolved to taste good without meat over the ages.

Meat eaters are used to a protein heavy diet. So ensure that you get enough of that.

Protein: Tofu, soya, lentils, peas, kidney beans, all kinds of legumes
Carbohydrates: Wheat, rice, potatoes
Fats: Vegetable oils
Vitamins, Minerals, and Fibers: Fruits, vegetables (Green/leafy vegetables are very important.)
Other important foods: Berries, nuts, seeds

Just some basics to get started. Personally, I would recommend to go slow starting with may be one meal a day to let your body get used to it gradually and smoothly rather than a sudden disruption."

SHINee,fgvyh68,t1_fgubq9k,1581154605.0,"The fan artist dynamics of kpop is just different from any other genre. I have been into digital space for very long and like youtubers. I have felt sort of connected to them. So, I have sort of cared about them. Considering that I am a cold person it's a big deal. But I seem to care about kpop idols even more. And I understand that it is genuine and the whole dynamics of how it is working. Because as a cold person, I need to analyse it all to be able to accept it. I can't just have emotions and feelings for about anyone. It's rare even in case of real life people for me. And for traditional celebrities, it's non-existent.
So, I think I really understand you. It's not stupid. We are people. They are people. And we get to see them more as people, the different aspects of their personality as complex human beings. Probably not all sides. We don't get to see all sides of anyone. Even we only show certain sides of ourselves to certain people. 
Also, they respond to fans through their songs, and other media. They seem to know what is being talked about and respond to that. Those things make the connection two way rather than a one way conversation. These things change the dynamics."

SHINee,fgsv133,t3_f07bgd,1581093236.0,"Apart from SHINee, I listen to BTS the most. I have been listening to TXT, Loona, Dreamcatcher, and IU as well. 

Other than that, I sometimes casually listen to Big Bang, Sunmi and Amber. I love SHINee and Big Bang live stages the most. Next I plan to explore Ateez, Seventeen, KARD, and GOT7. 

I also tend to stumble upon VIXX, TVXQ, GFriend, SNSD, 2NE1, and Miss A, EXO (just Playboy basically), SS501, Astro on rare occasions. Very rare.

For dance, I like watching TEN from NCT other than the mentioned groups/members. And I haven't mentioned the soloists from the groups separately."

AskReddit,ff3xjvu,t3_erc1ft,1579551038.0,"Ask them to get professional help because you are worried about them and any advice you might give as you listen to them might do more harm than good. While you should be sensitive enough to not be too harsh on them, please understand that indulging them isn't doing them any good either. And it is major blow to your mental health. A little coldness and practicality sometimes helps. In my case at least, it definitely did.

Also, you really should take care of yourself. No excuses."
bangtan,ff3ji0r,t3_er48ps,1579542372.0,"I think a lot of people who like to read or write are drawn to Yoongi and RM. People who are more into lyrics and are drawn to the the whole thought process are bound to take a natural interest in them because they are people behind a good proportion of it. The sincerity of words and the message is what a lot of people are here for. Also, xNTx personalities are probably drawn to these two people. They seem like the perfect pair. And work in synchrony.

RM also probably draws in some clumsy people like me.

I am also kind of waiting on JK to show his full potential. He is still growing. He seems like an over achiever already but he is nowhere near done. And he is curious and tends to have a multitude of interests and incomplete projects. I, an INTP,  can relate to that at a spiritual level."

LOONA,fdninib,t3_emavxj,1578586603.0,Can we get the message to them to put English Subtitles on all their official videos and MVs? It is very important to make it big worldwide. That is how all the organic views come. Otherwise they go to unofficial channels. And it really is organic views that helps the algorithm put the video on trending and gets to more people reaching wider audience. Just basics for marketing and promotion for international market. English Subtitles! Not expensive but very effective!

And you can continue to paint alongside. But don't give up on engineering. Most people are going to leave. So don't worry about the crowd. Do it. This is is the only thing you are gonna enjoy. You will have curiosity to into other things. Do them on the side. But don't stray too far from your path. You will be lost. Like I am. And it would be difficult, time taking, painful, and expensive to find your way back. Remember, you are an engineer at heart. You have always been and you will always be. No matter how much other things tempt you, they are not gonna hold you. Be an engineer. Leave your home town in two years and prepare for it. Study hard for 2 years. And your life will be a bliss. Don't be lost because you don't want to cause trouble like I did. It would only result in a bigger trouble later on. Be the engineer like you are meant to be. Believe in yourself. You are smart.
