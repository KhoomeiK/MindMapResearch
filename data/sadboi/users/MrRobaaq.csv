BPD,fqlbc74,t3_gjju9f,1589452809.0,I‚Äôve heard brain uses not only dreams but also emotions to do whatever he‚Äôs doing when we sleep. So waking up with some particular emotion is very popular.

BPD,fq9i7jq,t3_ghlwsw,1589199003.0,"After some time in therapy and watching/reading a lot about BPD I already feel like most of my symptoms are smaller. I‚Äôm only not sure how to fix attachment/abandonment issues, I guess only therapy will help with this one. It‚Äôs important to stay in therapy. These BPD therapies can take long but 80% of people who finish them do recover from symptoms so it‚Äôs very much worthy. 

I would recommend playlists about BPD on YouTube channels: 
1. Dr Daniel Fox 
2. Kati Morton
3. Dr Grande

Dr Grande is a psychiatrist with lots of knowledge. Daniel Fox is a psychologist an expert in personality disorders. Kati Morton is just a regular therapist and her knowledge isn‚Äôt impressive but she‚Äôs very nice, sympathetic and her videos are short.

I would also like to quote my previous comment;

people should not be attached too much to labels such as BPD as there‚Äôs 200+ variations of it. Also personality disorders are just a way for therapist to use particular approach for therapy and it does not define people. Some have only few symptoms. Some experience these symptoms completely differently than others.
Once I realized it I feel a lot better actually, more myself. If they wanted to define me they need completely new entry to DSM5 üòÇ."

But that was mistake. Now I enjoy being sensitive. Helps me figure out people. Understand them and their motives."
BPD,fq98jv5,t1_fq89d2k,1589189485.0,Thanks a lot for kind words. I‚Äôm sorry you feel this too. You‚Äôre right I will go on too. It can‚Äôt get worse so by definition can only get better.

BPD,fq678sp,t3_gh36hu,1589125914.0,Families sometimes create people with BPD. Sometimes it‚Äôs expected from ‚Äúblack sheeps‚Äù to behave badly so they are being provoked when they act differently. Dr Daniel Fox and Kati Morton talked about it in  some of their videos but I can‚Äôt find it. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend suspecting anyone of creating/making your BPD worse. Just surround yourself with supportive people as a general rule. Also it‚Äôs impossible to be just born with BPD. Studies show that BPD is 40% genetical (if I remember correctly) and the rest of it environmental.

Now I‚Äôll be able to create new team of friends made of only productive and supportive people once I learned how to control anger and emotion outbursts in general. 

The only minus is being completely alone. But im optimist and sure that I‚Äôll fix it, especially after therapy.

In 1,5 year when I guess my BPD intensified I quit all relationships and deleted Facebook (my only social media) quit college and job. Now I have only 6 contacts on my phone while 3 of them are family and 4th one is therapist lol.

I was doing it slowly quitting one/few relationships at a time and in the beginning it was ultra painful and stressful. But the more people I let go the easier it was. In the end I became terminator when it comes to exterminating relationships. So it gets easier with experience. But I wouldn‚Äôt recommend training yourself this way lol.

But I was grieving first peoples a lot. You should let yourself grieve. It‚Äôs natural. Especially with BPD."

BPD,fpv9dlp,t3_gfptby,1588939139.0,"Don't get too attached to labels. If I remember correctly BPD has more than 250 variations. Also, people differ so much that their symptoms of the same disorder may differ a lot. What's important is to just get you help with or without BPD. And you can totally tell the psychologist that you suspect yourself of BPD he won't accuse of being hypochondriac. Please try to find yourself some therapist and if you don't like him you might try another one. In a pandemic, you can get a visit trough skype or face time. And often you can order an appointment online through a website so it should all be a non-stressing procedure. Wish you the best!"
