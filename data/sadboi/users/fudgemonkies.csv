TBI,fo6jclb,t3_g5x2jm,1587560258.0,"I was in a very very similar position around your age. I had around 5 confirmed concussions by age 15, one of which was very severe. I struggled with untreated ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, all of which left me pretty unstable. I know it can be difficult to have hope when you're feeling so bad, but it can get better. If you find the right medications, are consistent with therapy, and give it some time, you'll feel better. Your age is likely not helping things; the front of the brain is less developed in your early teens, and that makes mood regulation more difficult. In my early 20s (even without the right meds), just being a bit older leveled me out some.

The best thing you can do right now is reach out for help. I can really empathize with worrying about being a burden, but I'm sure your parents love you and want you to be safe and as comfortable as possible. If your family has health insurance, I would strongly recommend seeking professional help as added support. Counselors are still available via phone or internet sessions despite the crisis."

I had a similar experience. I learned about EDs online in my teens; before that, I didn't know you could make yourself throw up. I have some stomach conditions that were uncontrolled at that time, and was regularly throwing up. I remember thinking clearly ""What if I make myself throw up more? No one will know the difference and I can lose more weight."" It was a very deliberate decision. But that decision was made on a foundation of: a lifetime of negative messaging about being slightly overweight, untreated dysphoria (I'm transmasculine), and usage of food to self-medicate depressive symptoms. I wouldn't have made that conscious decision without those factors."

My partner would get burned out, but still ask about some of my appointments. They did express wistfulness for the past, but framed as ""I'm sorry things are so much harder for you now."" The way your partner phrased that did not demonstrate concern for you, it was about them. 

Separately, how are you doing with the headache treatments now? I found a combo of depakote, magnesium oxide, botox injections, and cefaly as a PRN brought me down from daily severe headaches to less than 10 headache days a month.

TBI,ff0odj5,t3_er00ge,1579470760.0,"I need a bit more info here; how far out from your injury are you? 

If this is long term, your partner may be feeling burned out (thus demonstrating lack of caring about how you're doing). Again if long term, there might be things that you could be doing, either as part of your recovery process or just things with your partner, that would help your relationship with him. You could work on swapping ""my head hurts"" with ""I'm alright/ I'm ok/ I'm having a typical day"" (if your head hurts daily or semi-daily, in my experience it burns people out when you constantly tell them). You could be working on controlling the effects of your mood swings with medication and therapy, and you could compromise with him on physical intimacy with things like kissing or holding him while he plays with himself. 

But, if you were injured recently, I'd be concerned that this person is just self-centered and treating you poorly. It takes time to recover and learn new coping skills. 

In either scenario, if you're not immediately breaking up with him, call him out directly on the poor communication. Like ""I can't make you more comfortable if you don't tell me clearly what is wrong. I need you to tell me what you need."""

Anger is a flight or fight emotion, and is usually driven by perceived threat. 

For me, I go through this process with every new person my anchors see. It's less intense in general than when I was first getting into poly (7 years ago), but still creates feels (mostly anger). If I'm distracted when my partners are with others it helps. Everyone's habituation rate is also very different.

TBI,fely0gg,t3_epuh7o,1579233810.0,"I'm not really sure I understand your intro, but I'll answer semi-seriously.

TBI is a really big category of injury. There's different severities and different parts of the brain get injured. Plus peoples' brains tend to vary widely at baseline.

Depression and impaired judgment are common, but not universal. I'm not sure poor posture is very common, but if the areas of the brain responsible for managing posture are damaged, it'd be mechanically possible. Anxiety/depression can also cause poor posture.

Control your environment as much as possible. When not possible, use devices like ear plugs, noise cancelling headphones, bluelight filtering sunglasses. 

Ringing in your ears, aka tinnitus is common. You just learn to ignore it; distracting yourself with other noises (like quiet lo-fi, bird sounds) in the environment can help. My sister puts on quiet tv shows in languages she doesn't understand for her tinnitus.

Everyone copes differently. It really depends. I've made a lot of small and big changes to how I live to accommodate symptoms and prevent further injuries."

I accepted most people would reject me, but every now and then I would hit it off with someone, which gradually built my self esteem up. 

2) I went through the resources other folks suggested and took a hard look at where my feelings were coming from. I worked through what I could, and made some boundaries when I couldn't (e.g., asking to be given the opportunity to leave our house for their hookups).

3) Radical acceptance of the remaining jealousy, for both me and my partner. We found out eventually that I can't help getting feelings when they meet up with a new person. I don't ask for support all the time, and I've learned that it's ok to sit with some negative feelings. They pass. My partner accepts I get feelings, and knows that I won't let my feelings get in the way (e.g., interrupting or stopping dates) unless it's crisis-level urgent.

It is entirely possible to both have a fetish and be trans (I had a slight fetish pre-transition). It's entirely possible that you might be gender fluid or nonbinary, in which case you might need to spend time figuring out if any (or which) aspects of transition are right for you. A lot of non binary trans people never transition so they always have the option of presenting ""cis"" if they need to or want to.

This isn't a professional opinion, but I do suspect you might not be binary trans if you have periods where you go back to feeling like everything is legitimately fine when you present as male. I used to flip back and forth a bit myself, but I always had dysphoria about certain social and physical things when I presented as my birth sex. 

If you haven't already, I would strongly recommend testing out in safe spaces whether presenting femme in a non-sexual way feels right. There's trans support groups. Try pronouns out, test out clothes/makeup. Those are non-permanent and may help you start to figure things out in ways that one on one therapy can't."

Like many of the other commentors, it sounds to me like your rules are too strict; yeah, it can suck to have something personal shared without consent, but it also sounds like you haven't had any voices of authority to get input from until now.

You still have value as the person you are now, and I hope you can focus on what your current strengths are. People will love you for those, not your shortcomings."
FTMFitness,eo91hwi,t3_bqze6m,1558379861.0,"If you're very experienced and have no limitations on the types of exercises you can do, you can make it work at Planet Fitness and obtain or maintain a large size. It's super cheap, so it's all some folks can afford. A buddy of mine who is a pro wrestler used Planet Fitness for years.

That said, it's a really limited selection of equipment and much of it is oriented towards beginners (e.g., more machines than free weights or benches). If you're looking to expand what you can access, I'd really recommend switching gyms."
