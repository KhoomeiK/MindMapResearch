So note taking can be pretty varied, depending on who you are. But always keep it short and concise, don't just copy out the whole textbook onto a flashcard!

After each lesson, if you can, perhaps go over what you the hell you've just learnt. Did you understand it, did you get all the info you needed? 10-15 mins of re-summarising what you learnt will be super helpful and will allow you to recall it better in the next lesson, making you more focused in that lesson so on so forth. The best way to do this IMO is to make some really messy notes, like a spider diagram and compare it to your class notes. That way you can see what didn't stick as well and therefore what areas you need to go over. Or, do some practice Q's on the stuff you just learnt. A mix of both these will be even better! But again, see if this works for you. You can even use this method for revising things you've learnt in previous lessons, don't forget to go back and regularly test yourself on the things you first learnt!!

Also, as the year goes on, you're gonna wanna have some more legible notes for revision purposes. What I do is summarise a topic on a sheet of A4 (two at most) and use that to refer to. Use flashcards for more finickity things like dates. But in your frees, don't just sit there reading notes. Get someone to test you, bullet point how much you remember, and most importantly DO PRACTICE Q's!!!

The big big difference between A-Level and GCSE is that at GCSE you're fine just memorising an entire mark scheme off by heart. At A-Level, you're developing certain skills too! Sorry for how rush typed this is, and best of luck!!!"

6thForm,fpbgcr7,t3_gcfvai,1588469370.0,"well first of all, you sound like a beast OP. good for you, well done!

however, i do think you should perhaps cut down on the job hours. 12-16 hours is quite a bit, maybe negotiate with your line manager to see if you could work fewer hours? the start of year 13 is precious (trust me, i completely wasted it and regret it) and it's crucial to be on top of things from the START rather than at the end.

the start of year 13 is a good time to get your 'affairs in order' i guess. start seeing what bits you suck at, what you're good at, do your revision methods actually work? do you even have revision methods (lol i didn't and spent most of year 13 trying to figure what 'revising' is). i'm not saying revise every week, just make sure you don't fall behind on both short term and long term tasks. no pressure lol (dw, you'll be grand)

so altogether, no, i don't think having a job will affect the start of year 13 too much. just try not to overdo it, both with the job and the schoolwork. organisation is key!!

btw, i come from a low income background too and was on a school bursary that paid for my bus pass, trips, school equipment etc. it's worth seeing whether your school does the same thing, lots of luck :)"

I'm sure you must be experiencing feelings of anxiousness and even shame. Just know that this isn't anyone's fault. When I ended up in hospital over something similar my parents were quick to blame themselves/even me; this definitely didn't help anyone or anything.

 You and your wife just need to give yourselves plenty of time as well as your child, the road to recovery is already here for all of you. Life doesn't always go to plan but that's okay. As long as you are all there for each other, everything will be alright. Give each other space but be there; from my experience, sometimes a listening ear is more than enough.

AskReddit,fn8outu,t3_g05c2r,1586746562.0,"I'm still undecided but I lean heavily to the no kids side.

Personally, I feel too worn out to ever have children. Even though I'm still young (I'm an 18F), the majority of my childhood and teenage years have been spent helping my parents look after my many, younger siblings (I'm the oldest) and I feel like I've done enough child minding for one lifetime. Now don't get me wrong, I am no where near what a young carer is. However, I've basically become a mini parent to my siblings at the expense of my own mental health.

I remember times in my life when my mother was too exhausted to get out of bed and I had to console my crying, new-born siblings, being absolutely terrified and crying down the phone to my dad to come home from work and help. I remember times in my life where I missed out on things, such as birthday parties, sleepovers and being in paddling pools in lil swimming costumes cos I was 'too old' for that (I did the maths and I probs would've only been about 8). 

I grew up way too quickly and matured in a pretty sad way. The other day, I was thinking about the time when my twin siblings were born and thought 'well I was about 11 maybe, the amount of helping out I did was fair'. I quickly realised that I was only 7, which hit me hard. I've been robbed of not only key experiences that many children and teens have but I was put under an immense amount of stress, pressure and responsibility from a young age -- being shouted at when my siblings didn't behave or feeling bad for the amount of work my parents had to do and thus making their problems into my own too.

Sure, I'm grateful for the fact that I am pretty damn independent and am much more capable at house chores than my peers. But was the pain and mental health issues worth it? If anything, I ended up being a horrible sibling! As a young teen spiraling downwards under all the pressures of teenhood, school and all of this bs, I bullied some of my siblings relentlessly, especially one in particular to the point where they constantly act out now because of the label I've undoubtedly given them. I even have my whole family convinced to do the same (which I am super ashamed of).

I wish people would stop treating parenthood as this easy thing full of happiness and sparkles and rainbows. Now I'm not saying that it isn't special, because it definitely is! But people need to realise what they're getting themselves into and be prepared for the amount of energy, dedication and finances that it takes.

Also, I'm not sure if I can deal with any more whining, never ending questions and the general grossness of children. Maybe one day, but a day when I'm well into my life and career (hopefully). But as far as I can tell, no kids for me."

I can understand that you must be feeling frustrated, but please hang in there. You'll hear it a lot but life really does get better; the things you're facing won't be around for long. And I can tell that you're strong and resilient because you've made it this far.

You're even reaching out for help by posting on this subreddit, which just shows that you're closer to a better life than you think.

The best thing for you right now is slowly processing what's been going on and not being hard on yourself. And the best way to do that is talk. Whether it's talking to your friends or just posting whatever you feel comfortable about here, please don't bottle things up. I know from experience that it's a sure way to make things worse. You can even PM me, we're all here for you. Hang in there mate, you've got this.
