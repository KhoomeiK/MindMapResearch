If you see them even briefly outside of class you'll have something to talk about that's not related to classwork and doesn't rely on awkward icebreaker questions. For example say you both saw something funny on the way home, you could reference it next time you see them - boom, instant injoke. Stuff like that really helps speed up the friendship process imo."

relationship_advice,fp8x2aa,t3_gc2j2r,1588406015.0,"I could have written this, honestly. I actually think it probably comes down to a difference in attachment style. He likely doesn't feel the need to talk every day as a way of ensuring that your relationship is still solid, and feels that nothing will change on your end either if you aren't constantly talking. You sound like the anxiously attached type who wants to talk frequently in order to validate that the person still cares about you (I'm the same). I think the attachment styles handle stress differently. My partner is like your boyfriend and tends to go into his shell more when he is worried about stuff, which can feel as if he is freezing me out as we will often go without contact for a couple of days before he has figured himself out. What helped me with this a lot is reminding myself that it really isn't anything personal, it's just down to a different way of thinking and handling things. Your boyfriend probably wouldn't 100% understand your need for more frequent contact in the same way you don't quite understand his going off the radar and not calling more. We are in unprecedented times and I think couples are struggling to navigate this. 
I would talk to him about it, but in a less accusatory way. As I said, it is likely down to a difference in attachment style rather than intentional malice. Try to find out if it's just normal for him to drop off the radar when he's struggling, that might help you see it isn't personal. If he's open to compromise then great, but he probably won't change his behaviour 100%. You need to figure out whether or not that would be a deal breaker for you in the long term."
