Musicians who love what they do and have the guts to do it will always have an audience, rather it be a live show or streaming online.  I listen to Leo Moracchioli on YouTube all the time.  He's not really a mainstream artist, but he gets a lot of views, does shows and works with other artists just like him.  And he's doing just fine working out of his home studio in Norway.  (At least, I assume.  He did recently buy a new house and upgraded his studio, so he must being doing alright.)  Piracy might hurt the industry that's choosing, promoting and marketing the music we're most being sold, but as along as musicians like Leo have a way to be heard, music will never die."

The sheriff where I live posts mugshots on Facebook all the time and the comments are always full of people telling him what a wonderful job he's doing and how they should lock up, torture, put a bullet in whoever's head that got arrested.  What gets me is that these comments just spread hate and could be turned off, but the police choose not to.  What gets me most is that IF it turns out someone arrested was found innocent, the sheriff never posts a follow-up letting people know.  The innocent just has to go in with everyone thinking he's a criminal."

Not only that, but we've been playing the game for almost 2 years so fatigue is setting in.

More so, WWE Superstars like AJ Styles, Ricochet, Finn Balor, to name a few, have had amazing careers prior to entering the much more restrictive WWE.  As a fan, you owe it to yourself to look up some of these guys' greatest hits, particularly from Japan, because they are capable of so much more than what WWE will ever let you see."

So, I'm going to side with the police on this one, but I do think the officer's first job is to deescalate any potential situation and he failed to do that.  So, they were both in the wrong.

Yea, I know, ""Well, Wreck-it..."", but that happened before crossover skins were even a thing and we did get a free emote out of it.  But my point is, Epic has had to notice the excitement rapidly building for a potential Pennywise skin and still they're saying nothing.
