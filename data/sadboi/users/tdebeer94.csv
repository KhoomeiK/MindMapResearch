Anxiety,f03rybm,t3_czqtqt,1568367772.0,"I had this forever. I would crap 5-10 times daily from stressing over the smallest thing. And then I would stress about always having to crap... bad cycle. I recently cut out gluten and dairy from my diet (only been a few days now) and immediately felt better. Not just “I feel good”, I felt like a totally new person after. All anxiety and depression has vanished (it was very bad). I still stress of course, but I no longer get stomach aches and poop explosions anymore. It IS a pain in the ass finding food to eat, cause everything has one of those in it, but I would try it for a week and see how you feel :)"
Anxiety,f03rfo8,t3_cw8ahf,1568367161.0,TBH I suffered with this forever from playing sports to just working. Recently cut out dairy and gluten from my diet (used to eat a lot of bread and milk) and my body doesn’t stress tf out randomly anymore. Might help
afterlife,ezy46fd,t3_d2xhzq,1568257261.0,"You should listen/watch Joe Rogan’s podcasts. He talks to a lot of different people on the subject. It’s interesting because it seems everyone has a very similar “trip” when doing DMT. A lot of people describe it being similar to meditation, if you can get to that point mentally. Namaste 🙏"
afterlife,ew99xla,t1_ew8z31h,1565221950.0,Thank you for sharing. I really appreciate it. I wish I could experience what you experience. I feel like it would bring a lot of people peace of mind
afterlife,ew6jowg,t1_ev2onrl,1565172815.0,"What exactly is the “other side”. Is it the same kind of thing people experience through meditation/ DMT, or is it like a space where we all float around as spirits and do nothing forever? Serious questions.. this kind of stuff really fascinates me.

Thanks!"
afterlife,ew6jcpg,t3_cki4e1,1565172366.0,"I think the fact that almost all ancient civilizations believed in such similar things like the “the soul” etc without communicating with each other is pretty good evidence. I’m not religious, but I do think we as people have made “death” this scary terrible thing that happens. For all we know, it’s just the end of this life and we wake up in the another one!"
