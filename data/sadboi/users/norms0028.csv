I don't think the doctors respond to people complaining, I think they want to do what works, and I don't think telling people they need to lose weight works, I mean by that, it doesn't work for enough patients that they keep it up. After all, what is it, 5% keep the weight off? So they probably focus on helping us get NOT fatter?"

Only ONCE did a doctor talk to me about my weight and how much it was hurting me in the short, and the long run.  Finally 2 years ago I mentioned to a dr that I WANTED to lose weight, and he then says 'oh ya that would be a very good idea for your health.'  I didn't really think I was fat, despite the fact that all my friends, coworkers, potential dates all mentioned my weight, mostly in a derogatory way, talked about it all the time.  I knew I was big.. but HOW big? Not THAT big right?  Well I'm down 100 lbs and now everyone tells me I must be happier, more comfortable, etc.  So weird the medical community just didn't mention it to me.  My guess is? In general? it doesn't help to mention it to a patient and itmight even scare them away from getting medical attention.  There has to be a reason?"

For 3 days I make sure I drink lots of water, then for 3 days I add in the idea of walking a bit more, then I try and eat some healthy food too, then I try to cut out some sugar, then starch, then fat.  I then try to snack less, etc.  As soon as I can I start a journal that has food/drink/mood/exercise all written down daily.  All about 3 days at a time gaining new skills.  Eventually it takes off on it's own and I'm doing at least BETTER than before I started.  I speak for all of us here that we'd be glad to help.  The biggest problem I had with my recent loss of 100 lbs was I got pretty moody due to the release of hormones from the stored fat and I lost a lot of hair.
