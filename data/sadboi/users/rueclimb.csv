Contrasting, my workplace has certified MBTI staff and I went through the testing  and raised these issues. Our facilitator pointed out:

It does reliably predict how highly identified people are with the characteristics associated with each type (this thread is a good example of how many people identify as a contrarian). It shows you what others prefer and how they see themselves. 

After going through the testing and discussions as a manager I now have to admit that I better understand my team. I know how to better approach my extroverts and introverts. I understand the differences in getting tasks done between my perceivers and judgers. This then has given all of us a schema of personality to interpret our differences with and compare to others preferences, which my whole team felt was very useful.

So in conclusion, it does give you valuable personality information about other people and allows you to compare preferences. 

-ENTP :p that was begrudgingly convinced that the MBTI has value while only being slightly more scientific than a Cosmopolitan magazine quiz"
BipolarReddit,fpgr04n,t3_gd28bk,1588607926.0,"It‚Äôs okay to grieve the lost opportunity. I would suggest counselling if it‚Äôs available to you. I started counselling focused around grief shortly after my diagnosis and was able to work through the grief of the loss of some of the opportunities I had my hopes set on but could no longer do. 

Silver lining? Having doors close helped to cultivate a single-minded focus, discipline, and sense of grit when I committed to myself that this illness wasn‚Äôt going to take anything else from me. You can do this, you still have the character and grit that landed you in the Canadian Armed Forces in the first place."
Fencesitter,fnp8o9i,t3_g31t6o,1587141168.0,"I can understand why that would be important to you and your partner. Children would likely mourn your partner as you do, and in that way you would be less alone. 

In couple‚Äôs therapy there‚Äôs the you, me, and something else that forms when two people are in a relationship together. And there‚Äôs the same sort of thing when children are involved. It would never be the same ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù without my partner and the pain would be excruciating but I agree that it would help to feel as though there was some continuity in our family. 

I hope I can provide some semblance of that for our parents when one of them dies through support, ritual, shared grief, and shared memories."

Wife with bipolar disorder here.  Some thoughts: 

For what it‚Äôs worth I would absolutely want to know. The lows of the disorder are gut wrenching and the worst part is feeling alone and broken, like you need extra care. Knowing that you can relate is not a burden in my view, though I understand you know her and her health best.

Also, knowing that she kept you alive could help keep her alive someday. Once in a while I spend some time living for who I love but not for me and my perusing of bipolarreddit would suggest that I am not alone in this."

I notice it the most watching him struggle through my milestones (stressful, travel to get there, disruption to his routine). And it makes me tremendously sad to see him struggle to cope at my wedding and law school grad, almost late to both and wild-eyed. 

Also humbling to realize how much my social safety net and meds have helped me to avoid the same."

BipolarReddit,fli4tvi,t1_flh9mjw,1585175330.0,"Interesting question. I‚Äôve thought about this a lot. Tl;dr - no I do not equate mania with creativity. 

But what about personality and how bipolar disorder shapes us? I identify as an ENTP (yes, I also recognize that Myers Briggs has it limitations but there is a lot of associated data and analysis out there). I am not sure if there is any overlap between chemical patterns from the disorder and personality traits - though Dr. Jamieson‚Äôs research amongst others would suggest there is a link. And it certainly seems like it when I read the following: 

‚ÄúENTPs are known for their ‚ÄúChristmas tree‚Äù brain pattern. This pattern is called trans-contextual thinking. In this pattern, the neocortex is active all over, and each region has a high amplitude and is out-of-synch with the others. Each region is processing information and working to generate a creative, surprise result. While most personality types focus on particular brain regions to answer certain questions, ENTPs use trans-contextual thinking to include brain regions that seem to be unrelated to the question at hand. However, this helps them to discover unusual relationships between situations. Nardi explains this in his book The Neuroscience of Personality; ‚ÄúMost people, hearing the words ‚Äúdog‚Äù and ‚Äúcat‚Äù will evoke auditory regions like T3 and perhaps some visual or memory regions like O1 or C3‚Ä¶.However, the Ne types get busy using all regions ‚Ä¶perhaps suddenly imagining a story about two brothers, one of whom is faithful and sociable (like a dog) while the other is independent and quiet (like a cat). They might wonder about dog and cat writing styles too!‚Äù
Trans-contextual thinking is extremely energy-intensive, and ENTPs tend to experience very creative highs and also very strong lows as well. Because they bounce back and forth between so many different brain regions it can be natural for them to be mentally worn out at times. They may see so many sides to a situation or scenario that they find it hard to settle on one clear point.‚Äù 

https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/08/10/use-brain-based-myers-briggs-personality-type/

The above thinking pattern happens to me often as a person with BPD who has been treated for 10 years. By way of example, I won our company‚Äôs Christmas award for mind blowing ideas and smiled to myself. Perhaps my anecdotal story and observations are of some solace. 

All that to say that I think if there is a correlation between BPD and creativity, medication need not dampen it. Though I understand that it can and some combination of adapting to meds, grief, and depression managed to keep me in a state of perpetual grey for a number of months earlier on."
BipolarReddit,fle8b7j,t3_fo7jfd,1585079473.0,"It‚Äôs been nearly 10 years of stability and I do not miss that much from those years. I feel as though I am more or less my natural self today. 

I miss a certain thread of unadulterated joy that I experienced during hypomania, though this was also probably a function of being younger. 

I can still cultivate the focus and stamina that I had during those periods, though not as easily. I do miss that too.

Mostly I miss not having a secret. I get anxious during routine conversations and I over analyze my mood, words, and actions. I play over conversations and conflict. It‚Äôs as though I‚Äôve pushed ‚ÄúHer‚Äù into the shadows and I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll slip out if I‚Äôm not vigilant enough. Sometimes I fantasize about ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù and perhaps I will someday. I suspect though that the unification of shadow self and outward self (if we can call it that) does not really need a bold outward act to be meaningful. So I work not closing myself off to my manic side (journaling, drawing, wild googling sometimes, a cannabis habit) and in doing what I can to help others that I know that suffer in the same way."
