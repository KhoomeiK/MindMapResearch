FinalFantasy,fr69cy5,t1_fqdp2hr,1589922198.0,"Man, maybe it’s cause I was very indecisive in my roles. And when I played the highest level was 70. But I played for two years and my highest character was a 56Whm/28blm. I also had other skills leveled though like warrior and I was one of the little dudes lol. 


But when you get to a certain point it was hard to LFG since you had to go to very specific areas to gain levels somewhat quickly without dying so everybody was LFG there. I was usually pretty lucky as a whm, everybody needs healers, but spending hours teleporting people and warping back to juneau for payment for *days* just trying to save for something just got old.

And some of the warriors or other common classes LFG in those common places like Valkurm or the ice place below Juneau you could be logged in for 6 hours and get 1 party invite that lasts 20 minutes. Now playing a game involving waiting around to play a game is not very fun."

And triple triad has to be the best mini game in existence for any game. It’s made as such a “you don’t even have to do this” type of quest that actually had an entirely separate strategy for abolishing and removing rules.

So basically you tell your job you aren’t feeling well and go to the Dr who can possibly send you for a test, and you’ll have to wait weeks for the result. You have to assume you have it and isolate. If any time your job fires you in those weeks of waiting you are  able to collect. If they just take you off the schedule til your test comes in and it’s negative then yeah you’ll have to go back to work.
