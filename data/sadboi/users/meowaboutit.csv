Drunk Elephant B-Hydra Intensive Hydration Serum - I have been using this for a while and love the texture and velocity of the serum. It hydrates my skin and really makes a difference.

&#x200B;

Dr. Jart+ Cicapair Tiger Grass Camo Drops - I haven't used these yet but the girl at Sephora did a mini-makeover on me and used them and with some build-up they color corrected my redness. It was amazing seeing my face red-free.
