No one should tell you who you can and can't speak to. Forcing you to cut off friends is very toxic and was the first thing my abusive ex did. First it was guys, then it was girls too until I was all alone.  Trust is important in a relationship. If she doesn't trust you enough to speak to the opposite sex then what's the point honestly. You don't deserve that. It's not normal. It's not healthy. Draw your boundaries and if she crosses them it's time for you to go"

depressionregimens,fpu0p83,t3_gf8a77,1588902181.0,I had the same effect when I first took it. It was helping a lot the first few days and then the anxiety became unmanageable. I was shaking so hard my doctor stopped it immediately. I recently went on it again at a lower dosage 2 times a day instead and I haven't had that same experience. No anxiety this time. You probably can't tolerate the high dosage either so I'd talk to your psychiatrist about it and maybe lowering the dosage would work better for you too

Advice,fpjfjte,t1_fpik0ua,1588666634.0,"I think I can sum it in a couple sentences.

You go back because the person who hurt you and the person you love feel different. Most abusers if not all show their partner some kind of affection, a token of kindness and you cling onto that. Then in your mind theres a jekyl and hyde situation , but that person you love is still there so you keep going back hoping the monster never comes up again, but obviously it always will."

It only has to mean something to you. You say that whether you do something or do nothing it doesnt matter but matter to who? The universe? I'm pretty sure the universe cares because you're a little piece in its web and every piece matters so matter how small. Being small in the grand scheme of things doesnt meam youre worthless. Life may not have meaning. You may live your life and it wont change the world but so what. Do what you want, what makes you happy or things that you enjoy. I find life to be incredibly exhausting, when I fall into my depressive episodes, life itself is SO exhausting, it's just so much work honestly but you know what, feelings dont last forever. I've been clinically depressed close to a decade but that doesnt mean that in all that time I never felt happy or joy or pleasure in small things. I'm just trying to say, it doesnt have to matter. Live your life because you can, the only person it has to matter is you. So what if you're just a blip in the timeline of the universe. So am I. So are all of us. Life doesnt nees a reason to exist, it just does. So do you"

confessions,flt1i0l,t3_fqt34t,1585456481.0,"I agree. I see videos every where and it's frustrating. A lot of first responders will tell you that it's a selfless profession. People aren't kind. I got yelled at for things that weren't my fault. I felt the same way when the fires in California happened. I was furious because it started right after proposition 11 passed which made it to companies no longer required to give first responders lunch. Instead they had to work through lunch with pay. This was just a propaganda trick used by private companies like AMR to get out of lawsuits and make money. Every first responder I knew was against it. I told everyone I knew and yet it still passed. Being in the medical profession is difficult and often sucks. We're constantly being screwed over by those in charge and OP is right we're just cogs in a machine. We dont matter. But right now its all about HEROES. But what does the meaningless praise mean when nothing changes? At the end of the day when this pandemic ends everything will stay the same for medical professionals so what's the point? Its frustrating, I definitely agree with you."

TwoXChromosomes,fhjc9iq,t3_f3bf1o,1581642618.0,"I experienced something similar. I got out of an abusive people and soon after a guy started talking to me. I liked him and he seemed to be really into me. We went on a few dates and clicked really well and he was hinting at wanting to be in a relationship and I was hesitant. I've been through a lot and I wasnt sure I was ready. I felt like he didnt know me enough to want to be with me. He was very open about his feelings and seem super into me, even more than I was into him. So one night I came over and I had a deep talk with him and told him about sexual abuse I endured in my childhood. We ended up having sex and things ended well. Then the next day mid convo hw stops texting AND NEVER TEXTED ME AGAIN.

I was heartbroken. I was in such q vulnerable place and he stomped on the sad remains of my heart. It hurt my feelings. It made me feel like no one would want to be with me. I had to pick myself up though because I deserved better. It hurt q little less and less until it didnt anymore. One day months later I confronted him. He gave some lame excuse about not being ready for a relationship and I told him I thought he was trash for the way he treated me and it was a weight lifted off my shoulders. 

Some people just syck. You've been through a lot and I'm sorry about that. Someone will love you just the way you are. But dont forget to love yourself and know when you deserve better."

Sometimes I'm so empty and in so much pain I cant do anything but exist. But I know that feelings are not forever no matter what. I promise that no matter what feelings always change. No matter how terrible I feel it'll pass. Sometimes it takes days, sometimes weeks, and sometimes months. But eventually theres a moment in a day when I laugh and just for a couple seconds I feel a little lighter. Then another day when it's a lovely day and the way the sun feels on my skin makes me feel warm. Eventually these little moments add up and things start to feel less bleak. People have given great advice on this thread and I totally agree.

But in case you can't just know that's okay too. Sometimes all you can do is just hold on until it's a little less difficult to breathe and a little easier to be alive. You got this"
