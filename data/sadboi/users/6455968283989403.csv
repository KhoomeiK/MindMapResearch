Ik heb zelf al wel redelijk wat opgezocht over de studie, alleen wist ik niet echt wat je met de vrije keuze vakken allemaal kon doen. Dus daarom ben ik wel blij dat je de IDM annotatie benoemd, aangezien ik daar nog nooit van gehoord hebt. Ik ga daar even wat meer research na doen.

Verder is construction management & engineering niet echt een optie, aangezien ik toch wel via mijn stages al heb geleerd dat ik in eerste instantie toch nog wel de waterbouw in wil (en ook niet direct de constructie-kant van waterbouw). Universiteit Twente is ook een optie inderdaad waar ik ook nog wel even naar ga kijken. Maar in ieder geval bedankt, als ik nog meer vragen heb zal ik het laten weten!"

Ik ben daarom benieuwd of er ook genoeg mogelijkheden zijn om courses te volgen op het gebied van management tijdens de master. Dat zou voor mij een reden zijn om wel gewoon de civiele techniek master te volgen, want dat is nog steeds wel het vakgebied die mij het meest aanspreekt en wat ik ook zelf het leukste vind.
