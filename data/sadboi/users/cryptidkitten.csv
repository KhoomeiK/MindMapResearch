This was given to me as a gift by someone I‚Äôm no longer in contact with, so I‚Äôm unable to get any information about it. I found someone selling one that looks similar, possibly by the same artist and they said theirs was made in the USSR between the 1940s-1980s because it has a ""made in USSR"" stamp on the bottom. Another person on Etsy (not sure if the link will be deleted as spam so I'll hold off on linking) is selling two visually similar carvings of a deer and goat, and they said they got them in Moscow during the 1970s.

The one I have however is much taller than the similar ones I could find, and it has adjustable horns that can be rotated in place slightly. It unfortunately has no kind of signature or stamp on it. Does anyone recognize this artist‚Äôs style?"
