Anxiety,fr058xz,t3_gleczq,1589784142.0,"I had a rough week this week. I went hiking on Wednesday for the first time in about 2 months due to Covid 19. I had some kind of anxiety attack or panic attack because my heart was rapidly beating (more so than the hike would normally cause), i started to feel dizzy and faint and my brain went foggy. Since then my anxiety has spiked and I've had to enter ""self care"" mode by reflecting on my current life and what am I doing currently that is not helping my anxiety. I figured out pretty quick that my diet and especially my computer time (8 hours a day, due to classes, work and my love of computers) was a trigger for me. My brain would feel fried after such an extended period of time on the PC. 

To help control my anxiety issues I started some new things. I'm practicing darts so that I cam have another outlet. I'm also continuing to learn to play the guitar. Finally, I am painting some citadel miniatures (warhammer) which I find very therapeutic as it focuses my mind on a single task and stops my mind from wandering. I have also started to journal again as I feel the need and I am back mediating using The Honest Guys on YouTube. I have started cutting back my computer hours as I can and exercising and dieting better. 

On other notes I am very close to the end of the semester and my grades look good. I'm happy with my progress and I'm looking forward to a summer of small gradual life changes to help promote positive mental health. ðŸ˜€"

depression,fqavsph,t3_ghdi7l,1589226148.0,"I noticed that my issues while not depression (I suffer from anxiety) are related to my understanding of how fucked the world around me is. The corruption, the abuse, the racism and hatred and the acceptance of these things from so many people. What helped me is the planning of my future so that I can lead the life I want, which just so happens to be the van life of traveling around and seeing new things. This has relived some of my anxiety because I have a self defined goal and purpose and a reason to stay alive and be healthy. Could it be possible that the same could help you? I know it's hard to do anything when in a state of deep depression but nothing has to be immediate. Maybe small steps towards your definition of a life worth living and a lot of ignoring other people's opinions on your chosen path might help :)"

1. Become a professor or researcher.
2. Welcome to the corporate cogwheel."
education,flynlw7,t3_frfi4q,1585605530.0,"Let me tell you my story and maybe it will help you make a decision.

I grew up and attended school in Ireland. In Ireland we have secondary school which consists of two major exams, the junior certificate which is done around age 15/16 and the leaving certificate which is done around age 17/18. The later exam is the one that literally determines what you can and cannot do in college. If you do not score well enough you may not even get the points needed to attend college period. While I was going through my last few years of school I had many life events occur that set me on the path towards failure regarding my leaving certificate. My grandmother had a stroke which gave her stroke induced dementia, she had no idea who I was anymore. I also lived with an emotionally and verbally abusive single mother. During these times I greatly debated dropping out of school and just ""figuring it out"". Now, its one thing if you do not wish to attend college, I can see many reasons why that would work out well. But secondary school or high school is very important. I just about passed my leaving cert. I did not get the points needed to attend college in Ireland or doing anything significant with my life had I stayed in Ireland, it was not because I wasn't smart, its because life just got in the way and systems work for majorities not minorities (regarding life events and personal issues). However, what i did do was earn my ""diploma"" from secondary school/ high school. This allowed me to move to the USA (I have dual citizenship) and join the United States Airforce. A few years later and now I am almost done with my Computer Science degree. I have VA benefits for serving in the armed forces and I have valuable life experience. I am 100% not advocating for you joining a military service, I am merely telling my story of why high school is important. My main point is that if I had chosen to drop out of secondary school/high school when I was younger, I never would have had the chance to join the Airforce which was my only path towards higher education at the time. I would never have seen the the things I seen and I would not have met all the interesting people I met. Maybe where you live there are other opportunities to avail of, but without at least your diploma the future is bleak. See this to the end and see it as your escape route from a life of pain and I promise you that in a few years time you will be very thankful that you did. I have been in your shoes, I know the feelings you are having right now but it really does get much better. A relative of mine once told me ""Life sucks and then you die"" and the military thought me the following, ""embrace the suck"". If you can embrace the shitty parts of life and get by them you can really enjoy the positive parts, like traveling the world, meeting new people and even finding the love of your life <3

I wish you all the best,
