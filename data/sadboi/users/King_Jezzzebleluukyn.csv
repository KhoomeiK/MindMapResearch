Why do you feel we still need local laws? Why should you suddenly become a felon when you cross city lines doing something that was perfectly legal on the other side of that line? It made sense in the 1700s, as did states, but in the modern age? Utterly archaic. 

For an example, if you are a legal gun owner in New York state, and you drive through NYC, you are committing a felony because of New York City law. Your second amendment right is taken away because you crossed an imaginary line. If you can pass a background check, you should be able to have your gun in any state and any city. You should be able to have your weed too.

And marijuana is where the only argument for state's rights lies. Some states make progress quicker than others, and the fed is reluctant to make changes because they say ""it is up to the states"". Personal freedom is not up to the states, it is up to the fed and they should absolutely be legalizing marijuana in the entire country and forcing it upon every state. 

My proposal is if it is legal in one state right now, it should be legal in all states. Less laws is what this country needs, we're so bogged down in legal minutia that nothing ever gets done.

Thanks to Texas, that includes tank rentals being legal."

Get rid of state and local government entirely. One set of sensible laws for the entire country, no special laws for crossing arbitrary invisible lines.

There's a book called ""Three Felonies A Day"" about how with our ridiculous legal system everyone is constantly committing crimes without even knowing about it. That's because we have so many laws on so many books, the brightest legal mind could spend their entire lifetime trying to understand the law and never come close.

Anxiety+marijuana can be a bad combination as it can enhance your anxiety and cause extreme paranoia.

You won't find the right pill for you through someone else's experiences. You can only find the right pill combination by trying pill combinations until you find one that works. And one that works, might not exist for you, you could just do a bunch of dangerous pills for no reason.
