I told my therapist I wanted to leave the relationship, he said no, let's plan for the future of the relationship. I said no. I broke up with my ex and didn't tell therapist. A few sessions later, I pushed and pushed and pushed to get him to admit why he told me to stay in the relationship. His answer? ""Because the Borderline type is addicted to the cycle of abuse."" I said ""I KNEW IT. That's fucked up."" He said ""If you won't open up to me, I have no choice but to default to the relevant clinical data and my stereotypes.""

WHAT. THE FUCK. And no, my multiple complaints were not upheld. This was a sexually coercive abusive relationship as well, which my therapist knew. He even referenced my ex with the phrase ""Your ex, isn't that the one that tried to rape you?"" Him trying to rape me (well, telling me he was going to later) was why I wanted to leave in the first place.

Erotic transference is very normal in therapy (as in patients catching feelings), but a skilled therapist can handle and manage this and use it as part of the therapy, with supervision I am sure. Best psychologist I have ever had was a man actually. He got me to understand I had been abused and I will always appreciate that. He was warm, kind, patient and educated in my illnesses. Also, therapists are kind of supposed to be healing parental figures, in a much more academic way than I can detail.

BPD,f9i3u9h,t1_f9e2yrb,1575327607.0,"Well, my personal experience, splitting for me is feelings of low-level irritation beginning to creep in. I start seeing the person in a more negative light, things they do become progressively more annoying and I start wondering why I didn't see these faults before. I have to observe that it may not annoy me if others did it. I begin to think I am beginning to see a side of the person I didn't previously notice. How could I have been so blind? More and more starts to stand out and the feelings start to solidify. That's how it starts some of the time. I also have what I call a ""fear split"" where it's more like I become more hypervigilant/anxious/wary of someone because they've triggered something, it also enters irrational territory. Usually when I say splitting I mean eventually I will hate the person/not want to be around them/ready to leave because I am done. It's an extreme of perception that I feel it essential to act on. It depends, sometimes annoyance/irritation/even hatred is valid and it isn't splitting. But if I feel it is obsessively spiralling/I feel the bodily sensations of rage every time they are near me and I am constantly holding back from being snappy...IT'S SPLIT TIME. And shortly after I solidify into seeing them as the demon spawn, I genuinely believe everything I do is self defence. But obviously I am gone by then, I don't lash out.

Within the millions of people diagnosed with BPD, there are some who actually have Bipolar type 2, some who have Asperger's, some who have BPD and some who have ASPD/NPD and probably some other possibilities like attachment disorders or intermittent explosive disorder or something.

As someone with BPD, please do not say the ""true cases"" of those with BPD are actually female psychopaths.

I would not tell doctors or therapists until you have established that you trust each other and they are effective at treating your issues. Maybe ask if they know much about BPD?

BPD,f8u8vna,t1_f84vzo9,1574822433.0,"Been trying to get a psychiatrist for 3 years, so yeah...not ideal. On some meds though, but they don't touch the sides."
BPD,f8u8t3s,t1_f8lldjo,1574822379.0,Yep.
BPD,f8tzpv2,t3_d81eoc,1574815365.0,"I feel bad for you...but...you say in other posts she doesn't have a diagnosis of BPD!? You have decided she does. I wish I had not read through the things you have posted about BPD on another subreddit. We are not all the same person.

Hope you get help for what you have been through."
BingeEatingDisorder,f8f0ix5,t1_f2xyivc,1574536550.0,Wow. That's a really smart idea with the yoghurt!
BPD,f8bw5sk,t3_dhss6m,1574446716.0,"I know that feeling where the discomfort of resisting the rage gives way to the infernal nirvana of power. It's a relief to just burn up like a flame for a second. I don't lay waste to the earth, I just steam, but it feels good to give in. I hope you felt powerful for hours."
infp,f8bvhyn,t3_do137z,1574446282.0,"Hi, I have BPD and I had quite a lot of struggles around your age myself, so I understand how much you want to know exactly what is wrong quickly. Like you say, you aren't self-diagnosing, and I can confirm this is not ideal. You could turn out to be way off-base and be quite surprised. I think it is good you are trying to gain awareness of different symptoms, but don't scare yourself! Maybe keep a track of your moods, your reactions, thoughts, feelings and that can be something you show a therapist. Ask your dad about it again, or speak to a school counsellor or something, at least about how you feel. 

Unless I am mistaken, 14 is a bit young to get diagnosed as BPD, perhaps emergent BPD. Also, whilst accuracy is important, be mindful that there is a fairly hefty stigma attached to BPD as well, so don't internalise that if you get diagnosed one day. You may just be going through a difficult time, depression and anger is common in teenagers. Send me a private message if you need any advice if you like. If you have BPD, there are many options for success and recovery and it is good to catch it young like you mentioned."
BPD,f8b2o4s,t3_dxznt7,1574424628.0,"I feel you are great for trying to be so conscientious and aware. It isn't manipulative if we truly feel that way, but it is shocking and concerning for people to hear our intense feelings! As someone else said, maybe next time say you are feeling overwhelmed, try to use less emotive language perhaps. It is such a shame we can't be as honest as we'd like!"
BPD,f8b1wh1,t3_dzwx7l,1574423693.0,"So sorry to hear what you're going through. Hopefully he really is sorry and is suppressing the way he feels about it until he can cope with the guilt. Please talk to someone in your life, because as someone else said, you have signs of PTSD. It makes me sad to see you feel you have to hide how hurt you are."
BPD,f8b1r96,t1_f8ayvhc,1574423514.0,I think she means splitting.

CPTSD,f8a2p9w,t3_dzksx3,1574386137.0,Got to print this. Fantastic work.
BPD,f7cgwb1,t1_f7c66t9,1573591997.0,"Understood, but it's not always a losing game, not for all of us, if you don't mind me saying. Thank you for your compassion in a heart-breaking time. Impact vs intent is a good point, as long as people truly understand the lack of intent coming from most of us. All the best."
BPD,f7cgfec,t1_f7ccjwc,1573591710.0,"Not a problem at all, you deserve validation. You deserve a space."
BPD,f7c3wkv,t3_ccd7a7,1573583845.0,"What a disgraceful man. Well done for fighting for us and for tolerating it as best as you could. Times are changing, may not have seemed like it in that room. For all you know, some people believed you. Some people can come to their own conclusions."
