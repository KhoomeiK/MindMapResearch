Criterion A
You were exposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation. In addition, these events were experienced in one or more of the following ways:

You experienced the event. 
You witnessed the event as it occurred to someone else.

But it's belittling to the experiences of people who have had life threatening experiences or serious sexual assault, to say that the symptoms of watching a movie or a pet dying are comparable. In my opinion it's healthy to question your diagnosis. If you're traumatised by something that for most people is not that traumatic (distressing, maybe, but not traumatic in the ptsd sense) then maybe something else is going on that needs treating.

That said, I recognise there are different types of trauma.

I know that's hard to believe given my past antics but I've been so busy with the new job and moving house haven't had the time to think about partying. Am trying to leave all that behind and start over. It was me who broke your guitar at the party before then, though. Or was it a trumpet? I can't remember. I was high as a kite and hadn't slept in 4 days if I remember rightly. I will replace it, whatever it was..."

ptsd,foztrhm,t1_fozspcz,1588196718.0,"That's good to hear you are seeing someone to talk things through with. I hope they are a good fit for you and that it helps. It takes a long time to get to the point where you can feel angry, sometimes. Any kind of child abuse is serious and can have a severely damaging effect, it's happening at a time you're developing and still learning about your place in the world...it can physically alter the development of your brain. There are many different experiences that lead to ptsd and just because you haven't had a more typically ptsd-associated trauma doesn't mean you should dismiss the severity of what's happened to you. Sometimes people come on here and say they think they've got ptsd from watching a movie - that is maybe an overreaction. Being groomed and exposed to explicit sexual content of children over a period of years when just a child yourself is an entirely different category. It's serious. I'm sorry that happened to you and that someone abused your trust in this way."
AskReddit,fozq8xh,t1_fozeydw,1588194972.0,"There are plenty of social media influences in the ""third world"". This 'first world problem' phrase gets my goat at times. Anyone who's lived in or been to a developing country knows they also have trains, mobile phones, social media, TV, skyscrapers, etc for the most part. It's like people seem to think everyone in Africa is living in a mud hut and running around half naked... Anyway, this is a topic for a new askreddit I think..."
infp,fozp91e,t3_gaczmy,1588194476.0,"I wouldn't take it too seriously. Myers-briggs is pop psychogy, people are way more complex than 16 sub-types. It's a bit of fun and interesting, and can help find like-minded people, but I expect there's a huge scope of differences between people in any one subgroup. Perhaps just as much or even more difference as there is between different subgroups in some cases."
HaveWeMet,fozoldr,t1_fozlpiz,1588194150.0,"Hello, I would say it wouldn't be safe for a dog if you were to crash, while serious injuries to yourself would be unlikely, it could be fatal for your dog as we wouldn't have a seat belt nor helmet for her.  You would be welcome to bring your dog, though. There are plenty of fields around for her to run in, and I'd be happy to keep an eye on her while you're on the Go-kart. She could still wear cute goggles,too. Farmer Carson's fresh farm store also sells dog treats and toys, and it's just a short walk from the Go-kart track."
ptsd,fozledp,t3_gagdgm,1588192612.0,"Exposing a child to sexual images is a kind of sexual assault in law. So is him masterbating in front of you, I'm sorry to say what you experienced was sexual abuse as well as grooming. As a 14 year old groomed by this man it's no wonder you didn't realise what was wrong with the child abuse images, as you haven't looked at them since I don't think you should feel responsible, you were a victim. Sexual assault is one of the experiences mentioned in the dsm 5 ptsd criteria, but this does not mean you necessarily have it, just that it's potentially not ruled out. Obviously nobody here can diagnose you - that's something you'd need an in depth interview with a professional to diagnose. Either way, what happened to you sounds like it was damaging and hurtful, even if you thought it was 'normal' at the time. Lots of different psychological problems can occur after sexual assault other than and including ptsd.  It's really worth speaking to someone about this - evidence shows that the sooner you confront it and seek treatment, the better the outcome is in the long run.  Having experienced this kind of trauma doesn't mean that you will necessarily go on to develop a mental health problem, especially not if you get the right help as early as possible.  Take good care."
HaveWeMet,foz87h8,t3_ga3v7p,1588186307.0,"Richard, I don't want to be a hypocrite. I know I've had some pretty wild parties during this lockdown, but I've come to realise my wrongs. We all need to practise social distancing for the good of everyone in LDP. I hope your party was a small one with people standing at least 2 feet apart. If you need any peer support for drugs or alcohol too, give me a bell. I'm no professional but on the road to recovery myself. Take care friend."

The illuminati Conspiracy was nazi propaganda created to stir up hatred against Jews. No joke - look up Nesta Helen Webster. She was a member of the British fascist party and wrote 'protocols of the elders of zion' a Conspiracy book about the new world order. So, if you don't want to be associated with antisemites and nazis, leave the cellphone towers alone..."

I expect the goat will wander back home. You could call the animal sanctuary also - they mentioned missing some cows but didn't say anything about goats. Still, worth checking..."
