I work a full day on Saturdays and Sundays and shorter shifts Wed-Fri. Having 2 days off immediately following my longer days helps me manage my fatigue to an extent.

Not time wise, but the energy it takes to go, sit in an uncomfortable chair, be in public, etc.  He’s started to do things like that for me, because he knows it needs to be done and I struggle to have enough energy for everything. 

Every so often I go to a [float spa](https://www.sanctuaryfloatspa.com/float?gclid=Cj0KCQiAkePyBRCEARIsAMy5SctiKSTPEZDS2NdY2Qzbf3sOmFdphny4ETpUQhK1ksU5us61azPNytMaAnN2EALw_wcB) and recently I got a massage right after my float. It was amazing.

I remember my dad telling me at one point that I shouldn’t ever tell anyone I worked with, and definitely never tell my job. At the time I could see the wisdom behind it because even anxiety and depression weren’t really talked about. Now though, screw that. It’s not something I asked for.

Edited to add- there are some meditations I use with certain pain, like headaches or migraines. They help me relax enough to relieve some of the pain.

I had always thought of the canes we see older people using and couldn’t imagine using one of those.  I found a few options and picked the one I thought would go best with my wardrobe and my work uniform, but also had a bit of style to it."
Fibromyalgia,fee2nzk,t1_fedmuo7,1579025136.0,"That’s what I’ve been thinking too. I’m only 33, I shouldn’t need something to help me get around. I’m tougher than this. But I’m hoping that having it will make it easier to be out and active."
Fibromyalgia,fee2jux,t1_fedi0n1,1579025067.0,"That’s exactly what I was doing too. I found one that I liked that folds up so I can keep it in my bag when I don’t need it, but bring it out when I do."
Fibromyalgia,fee2gza,t1_fee14jx,1579025020.0,Thank you!
Fibromyalgia,fee2geu,t1_fedwfg6,1579025010.0,"I think that’s the think that pisses me off the most. No, I don’t look sick. Yes, I seem like a positive person. Would it be better if I was a crab-ass every day? Would you prefer that I actually let the world see how much pain I am in, how tired I am, and how sick I am of dealing with both 24/7? No, you’d probably think I’m a jerk who can’t deal with what life dealt her. Can’t win for losing."
Fibromyalgia,fee26s2,t1_fedex9d,1579024850.0,"I’ve already fallen once this winter, thankfully it wasn’t a bad fall. I only tweaked my knee, had a sore butt, and hurt my pride. Lol."
Fibromyalgia,fecy1on,t1_fecxik8,1578989287.0,I’ll let you know. I’m hoping it helps.
Fibromyalgia,fecy10j,t1_fecxq2h,1578989263.0,"I got one that has a pretty handle and rhinestones on it because it was roughly the same price as others I looked at, and foldable so I can keep it in my bag when I don’t need it. I’m hoping it helps me, but I’m a bit apprehensive to use it in public.

ETA like for the purchase [pretty rhinestone cane ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NADQCTM/ref=cm_sw_r_oth_api_i_FAxhEb9FE3WW0)"
BipolarReddit,fe6rdjm,t1_fe636hk,1578901789.0,"I hated tegratol. It made me so dizzy and nonfunctional after each dose. I’m doing okay on Lamictal, but I’m starting to have memory issues after being on it for nearly 10 years. I didn’t have any real noticeable issues until the last year or two when my Fibromyalgia started really kicking my butt."
crochet,fe6r8oz,t1_fe5n1cy,1578901608.0, It’s the [meandering paw prints](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/meandering-paw-prints) pattern. I made one of these recently too for a secret Santa gift!
Fibromyalgia,fe6r3np,t1_fe6h1lq,1578901421.0,Hot hands! Most stores should carry them in the colder states. I buy them in a large pack so I can always keep some with me.
Fibromyalgia,fe6r1kk,t3_enyjcc,1578901347.0,"I’m in a cold area too (Minnesota), so I think I have an idea on how you’re feeling. A few things that help me.

1. [Lush’s Wiccy magic muscles massage bar](https://www.lushusa.com/body/massage-bars/wiccy-magic-muscles/03862.html)  I rub it all over my back and it helps me relax. It also smells nice, which is a bonus. 
2. Heated blankets, foot warmers, heating pad, and those hot hands hand warmers. Really anything that helps me warm up.
3. Comfy clothes that I’ve gotten for days I don’t feel the greatest (which is most days right now.) I have a sweatshirt, sweat pants, and a fuzzy cardigan that are my go to comfy clothes. Oh, and fuzzy socks.
4. Yoga/stretches: Child’s pose, cat cow, baby cobra, thread the needle, happy baby, and pigeon, and reclined pigeon. The last 3 are for my hips because I’ve realized that tight hips tend to make my back pain worse. I’ve also learned that stretching helps ease the worst of it, but not to push myself too hard when I’m in pain. 
5. Hot tea and a project I can do either relaxing on the couch or in bed, like knitting or crocheting. 

I hope some of these help!

Hugs (if you want them)  from an internet stranger."

ChronicPain,fe6gtwe,t1_fe6dn5s,1578890471.0,"Oh I wish! That would be about a 7 hour drive from me. Though, maybe I should look into the University of Minnesota.... and thanks! I wish you all the best as well. :-)"
ChronicPain,fe06g8o,t1_fe03lqq,1578804259.0,It sounds like you’ve got a great team! My neuro “ruled out” MS because I’ve had no change to the lesions on my brain and neck over the last year.  I’m thinking about either getting a second opinion from another neurologist because I have several lesions on my brain and brain stem. If it’s relapsing remitting MS I could be in remission right now and at some point my immune system will wage war against my brain. Only time will tell.
BipolarReddit,fe04p0e,t3_endb1u,1578803002.0,I’m proud of you! I worked in an inpatient facility and it was rare for anyone to come in on a voluntary basis. I’m very proud that you recognized that you needed more help than you were able to get on your own.
crochet,fe04kky,t3_engj90,1578802913.0,This is so pretty! Very well done.
ChronicPain,fdtsixr,t3_en182a,1578721518.0,"I’ve gotten to the point that my base level now is manageable, whereas a year ago it wasn’t. I’m finding that I can push myself through migraines more than I used to be able to- where the pain is bad but I can still kind of function? I think that I’ve just gotten so used to being in pain that it doesn’t affect me as much if it’s just my base level now.

In the rare instances where I either have very little pain or no pain I start to panic a bit because either something is very wrong that suddenly nothing hurts (what kind of fucked up thinking is that, btw?) or think oh shit, this is going to be really bad when it comes back."
