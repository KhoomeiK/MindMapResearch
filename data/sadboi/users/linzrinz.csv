Tourettes,f7zki65,t3_dy4x2m,1574112045.0,"a lot of times, tics relate to mental stress. maybe working with your partner to relive any mental strain that you can would help? i bet just being someone your partner can vent their frustrations to helps so much. my partner gives me massages for sore muscles and calms me down if i’m being difficult and trying to power through something i shouldn’t be trying to power through.

the fact that you made this post shows you care and i bet you’re doing amazing :)"
autism,f7jw86i,t1_f7hvpdg,1573788092.0,i’m really considering just sending her a bunch of links to articles talking about handling meltdowns but i’m nervous she’ll get angry again. thank you for the kind words :)
autism,f7eada3,t1_f7drgtb,1573652184.0,"i understand that she was stressed, but i’m not going to apologize and i’m not sympathetic. (also i’m a girl). she did absolutely nothing to help me and berated me continuously, even after i was literally begging her to stop (in the car) and when i tried to leave (in my room). she almost threw something. she purposefully turned on noises she knows irritates me. during the meltdown i was screaming for help (in my room, where she wasn’t driving) and she stared at me with disgust. i’m not apologizing for having a completely uncontrollable reaction to stress when nowhere in the process did she even try to be nice.  you said “every time she takes her eyes off the road to help your meltdown” but the point is she never tried to help. the moment i started to cry she got angry. 

you’re saying i didn’t handle it perfectly but what did i do wrong? i tried to leave to calm down, i tried asking her to stop."
autism,f7e9vox,t1_f7dp5te,1573651754.0,seriously. she doesn’t know how to handle mental health at all and it’s draining

Instead of signing “she uses” you could maybe sign “ingredients” and then use the correct form for signing lists.

Once again I’m a beginner but hopefully this helps!"

Tourettes,ez4l4hc,t3_cztdb5,1567688502.0,i’ve just started that med! it’s for my adhd but i’ve noticed it helps ease the tics a bit. hopefully it’ll have a bigger effect on you!
autism,eyozt6q,t3_cxvatp,1567286479.0,"oh boy, this sounds EXACTLY like my situation. when i was a kid i was diagnosed and my parents decided not to tell me. they didn’t want labels to hold me back and, like your son, i was super social and fun. i didn’t look or act disabled, so what was the harm?

here’s the harm: i grew up hating myself. i couldn’t connect with other kids, i didn’t act like them, everything just seemed different. it felt like i was trying to violently shove myself into a mold that just wasn’t built for me. when i couldn’t do things other children could, i blamed myself. when i couldn’t make friends, i thought it was because i was weird. i held myself to allistic (non-autistic) standards my entire life and it CRUSHED my self esteem. 

when i found out i was autistic, it put a whole new light on my life. those weird repetitive movements i made that people made fun of me for? stims! those “temper tantrums” i had as a kid? meltdowns! my obsession with all things related to writing? that’s a special interest! everything suddenly made sense! i realized there wasn’t anything “wrong” about me, i was just biologically different. 

i strongly advise you tell your kid. autism presents itself in so many beautiful ways and eventually, the denial will fade into acceptance and appreciation. but first, realize why you shy away from terms like “disabled” and “special needs.” it’s because society has told you over and over that those terms are evil, and autism will do nothing but tie your kid down.

if you realize that “disabled” isn’t a dirty word, and that autism has SO many fantastic qualities to it, you’ll be able to present it to your kid in a way that propels him forward instead of tying him down. if you introduce autism and disability to him as just another aspect of his life (and a positive one at that!) then he’ll be able to accept himself and grow in a way so many other autistic people never had the chance to. acknowledge the struggles, but don’t let that be the main focus of this diagnosis. your son, autism and all, is beautiful!"
autism,eyoy1wx,t3_cxvhyr,1567285303.0,"i totally get this! i’m super clingy and the ultimate hopeless romantic. i’ve never understood social rules regarding relationships. i text back immediately and double (and triple and quadruple) text, which apparently is a no-no? my mom is always telling me i “shouldn’t be so available, because guys like a chase,” which just sounds stupid to me. 

i never really flirt, either. i’m pretty straightforward and the whole “talking stage” of relationships has always gone over my head."

Tourettes,etxpd8j,t3_cdyvem,1563304394.0,make sure to include self love and acceptance! let them know that they should never try and medicate and get rid of their tics for other people and only do it for themselves. :)
