gay_irl,fr4vpo2,t1_fr4vm1j,1589897778.0,And that's discussion. Have a good one.
gay_irl,fr4ushe,t1_fr4tqas,1589897281.0,"It's not necessary in a kids game. I get theres heterosexuality representation and even then that baffles me, and I can accept those storylines are from like 1990's to give the games some sort of storyline. Whether it's Link chasing after a female or Link chasing after a male, my six year old self was more concerned about how to use a hook shot then understanding any type of instances that regarded relationships in video games.

Same with Mario and the damsel in distress, it just comes off as a typical 90's storyline now that i'm older. When I was younger, it was about fighting the bad guy who took this nice lady. 

But there's the counter argument (that is absolutely correct) that atleast having representation sets up for some exposure which will later ease the understanding for later in life. 

But i still stand by what i said. we don't desperately need it. It could be nice, or would be for some people. Someone who previously commented said ""it's not about representation, it's about showing families and love"" and that's a good way to put it, but it still doesn't change the fact most kids will not put a single thought into those relationships until they are old enough to understand and comprehend them. You think my ass was worried about that bitch Zelda? This big ass meanie Ginger was my only concerned back then. 

I rather Nintendo not add a gay character for the sake of showing gays exist. If they're going to show representation for LGBT, have it be for the reason of it being a good, flushed out character. Like Birdo.

Desperately need it though? Nope. Feel free to disagree though."
gay_irl,fr4rp0g,t1_fr4r16b,1589895525.0,"Birdo exists. 

And anyway, you put it in better words. We don't need Nintendo to come right out and be like ""hey, we gots the gay in our game"". I prefer them to be subtle like how they are with Birdo, who's gender non-conforming. 

My original intent of my comment was to say, we don't need representation of sexualities in a kids game. We don't need them to be presented to us, we just need them to be there. Representation in a kids game about saving the world from a turtle isn't the most important thing and I stick by to that opinion."
