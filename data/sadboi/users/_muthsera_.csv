FortCollins,f1auyo4,t1_ezi7u3k,1569308569.0,"Might be late to the party on this post, but try open mic nights in Loveland. Chillers on 4th St does one every Wednesday, and the people that sign up and play are actually really great! It's the only reason I go to Loveland anymore, and alot of the performers do country/blues/rock music. Loveland is working on creating a music scene, and it's definitely not as flooded as Fort Collins, might be easier to gain traction there? At very least to network with musicians with similar tastes."

It's a super inspirational building though! Earlier today I made a version of it in Sanctuary. It's perfect for there because you can have that wide wall of windows facing the street with a picket fence yard in front. Thanks so much for sharing this :)"

NintendoSwitch,ezicexz,t1_ezi7wr1,1567924745.0,"It doesnt look like the Switch supports any video service other than HULU at the moment either. So if I were to pay more for the TV mode, I'd definitely want that ability. Knowing now that the list of games the Switch Lite wont support is very, very small; I'd happily trade the TV option for saving $100 and a more compact (and in my mind, sturdier because it's one piece) system. I guess if I had people over and played multiplayer games it would make more sense to have the TV option, and I think that's really the deciding factor is the type of gaming you'd be doing with it."

NintendoSwitch,ezi6j2j,t3_d0uncx,1567922054.0,"I'm looking into buying a Switch, specifically for Animal Crossing New Horizons that's coming out next year. I don't think I'd use the TV mode all that much, so I was looking into the Switch Lites. Those only support handheld games though, so I'm not sure if any of the other games I'd want to play on it would be compatible. Nintendo's website says that there's an icon next to games that support handheld mode, but I really couldn't find that icon on any games at all. Specifically, does any one know if Skyrim or Spyro support handheld play? And do we know yet if Animal Crossing will support that either? For those that have the normal Switch (the Lite isn't out until the 20th it looks like) is the ability to play on the TV worth the extra cost? Thanks in advance!"

BipolarReddit,ev8v07j,t1_ev8pdq2,1564292625.0,"Lmfao! I guess I need to work on my observational skills. It's a great video, I think it'll be very valuable to revisit now and then, esp when you start having those doubts creep in. Like others have said, if you're afraid of losing him then he clearly means something to you. The minor details of a person's personality will change and contort over time, their ambitions, ideals, values, tastes, desires all shift and sway in this direction or that or back to where they started and back somewhere else again. I know I wouldn't quite recognize myself now if I was looking at me from 10 years, even 6 months ago. But I would recognize me at my core, the base essence of my nature that makes me who I am. And that's what you need to fall in love with, both in yourself and your partner. That's the bit that will never really change and always be familiar, even when the illness makes it foriegn and hard to find."
