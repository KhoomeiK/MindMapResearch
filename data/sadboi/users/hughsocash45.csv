If we lived in a just world, the opinions of people who eat meat wouldn't mean shit and the well being of animals and the health of the planet would come first. In all honesty, animal products should be outlawed across the board regardless of what the public thinks. They cause far too much suffering in the world and it us pretty fucking sickening how little people think about how their actions have consequences. They'd rather think iT's tHE wEAlThY oNe pErCEnT than change anything about themselves or ever take into consideration that poor people who eat meat are just as selfish as billionaires who profit off of animal agriculture."

That's why there's so many science magazines boasting about how great humans are are wrong on that front.

Since introducing the new combat in Origins and liking it, it seemed to have taken a dip in Odyssey. The main thing is dismemberment and decapitations which we are finally getting in AC after all these years, and that alone will make the combat more epic and crunchy. Origins had the best combat but the lack of gore held it back. Odyssey had the spongiest combat that I wasn't a fan of. Seems to be changing in Valhalla for the best. 

I appreciate Ubi for trying new things even if it doesn't work out all too well. Which is why I think Gods and Monsters will be what the team that worked on Odyssey wanted to make the whole time, but this time having free regin to be more creative and not held back by AC series tropes that I hope will make more of a return in Valhalla."

I mean fuck. I went through two weeks of vigorous treatment at a fucking detox clinic where I had no booze, no phone, nothing good on TV, no internet, no video games and where men and women were segregated (a thing feminists want between men and women), and where I could do nothing but go to boring fucking speeches every fucking night and then lights out by 11 o'clock. Not to mention be brainwashed by the ultra bible thumping nonsense of the twelve step programs and AA. It sucked. Did the detox, I'm still sober and I've lost a lot of weight from not drinking all this time and now the pandemic hit. All of the fun places I couldve gone to are closed indefinitely because of the virus. So there ya go. I am actively trying to make my life better by not drinking all the time, I'm limiting my time on these forums since even they can cause fucked up thoughts to proliferate in my head, and I'm trying to think more openly about my issues and societal issues and I still am a lump on a fucking black pilled log. It *was* gonna get better. I had planned on meeting up with a short cute hispanic girl with bushy hair in the Reading Pennsylvania area after rehab  BUT...obviously can't now. I was also going to use my new social skills I learned in rehab as well as my better looking, non alcohol drowned, much more leaner not fat body that I got after quitting booze to win over some chicks. Nope! Probably a month later my state and my country went into indefinite lockdowns and the places where I'd normally talk to women aren't open. 

Yes my life has gotten better without booze and I'd be lying if I said I'm not enjoying the quarantine. But when people say shit like this, they're not getting the whole picture. Most humans are the product of their environment. If a man who isn't the most popular guy in school and also isn't the best looking kid in his class is told (often from an attractive 20 or 30 something man or woman who is already happily married)  that if he's just confident enough and respects the women and the chads that they always seem to get, then he'll get a woman too. That didn't work out well for the kid, so as the years go on and he keeps getting rejected into high school, after high school, into college and the job market and beyond, and he gets the same results, he's gonna be more drawn to places like this or other incel/FA/Redpill/MGTOW places because he has been told that it is his fault for not being able to get a GF. Where, if they saw the whole picture, maybe theyd realize that not only did he get rejected, he got rejected in the most cruel ways possible over the years. By the time he reached my age (23) and he still hasn't had a girlfriend or sex (like me), is it really any surprise that he falls into the incel movement? And it's only gonna get worse with this quarantine thing happening. I feel as if the belief that feminism eventually helping men (trickle down) was ever going to help the struggling dateless, sexless, introverted and the average man, we wouldn't have the issue of this generation and future generations having less sex than previous generations."

They certainly weren't converted via peace and understanding the way left wing college professors teach you. I've heard mine say that when I brought up the question of how many of the people beyond Saudi Arabia became muslims and he tried to tell his students that Islam means peace. Sure, tell that to the Africans that muslims have forcefully converted and dehumanized over the centuries. Yes, the transatlantic slave trade was absolutely awful and that the US should never ever forget about it so that we never experience those horrors ever ever again. But rarely ever are we told about the Arab slave trade and how many unique cultures throughout the Middle East and Africa were cleansed, raped and erased due to the spread of Islam. 

My point being is that for people calling Israel a colonialist project, they have a lot of nerve considering their cultures were often founded through violent means way more than Israel has. Like try finding one openly Jewish or openly LGBT person in a place like Yemen or Pakistan. Those are two minorities that the left claims to stand up for but have no qualms about throwing them under the bus to protect islamic theocracies."

I'm not saying Israel is innocent, but given the types of enemies that they're dealing with, their force is neccessary. 

And because you know people who are Jewish (who may not even have a connection to Israel) how in the hell is that supposed to be a reason why Israel shouldn't exist? Israel was founded due to thousands of years of persecution from both Europeans and Muslim countries. For many, Israel is all that they have.

Not exactly a ""wHiTe cOlOniAlIsT eThNoStAtE"" as the left in the US and Europe puts it. Also never mind the several plans Israeli has offered the Palestinians and their rejection of it every time. 

Look I'm not saying the Palestinians have it easy and no doubt many of them are treated like shit (probably still have it better than the Jews of Europe during WWII had it though) but the fact of the matter is that the existence of Israel is a neccessary thing for the Jews considering that so many nations and cultures (most of them surrounding Israel) have wanted to murder every last Jewish man, woman and child.

If a little girl is kidnapped and found dead, as horrible as it is, the news focuses more on it than if it was a little boy. 

The murder of Tessa Majors, the 18-year-old girl murdered in Central Park earlier this year was absolutely horrible and it is a shame that it happened. But for some reason I think if it was a male the media wouldn't report on it anywhere near as much. Men make up the majority of homicide deaths but these poor souls never get the sort of recognition that they deserve. 

And when I say things along these lines, I'm not blaming the average Jane or Jill. I like the majority of women I meet and of course women shouldn't have to worry about sexual crimes. But the fact of the matter is most of the feminists that go against these arguments aren't the average Jane or Jill. Note when I say this I'm not blaming the average woman.

However, with animals there is no way for them to communicate whether or not they're suicidal or whatever. So we should give animals the benefit of the doubt and assume that they don't want to die, and thus people should leave them off their plate.

misanthropy,fpswokd,t1_fpr5a9x,1588880886.0,Sorry I'm not really caught up on my history in that regard. I prefer not to glorify people like that. Even still though it is just proof of how we let people get away with horrific things. Like look at OJ Simpson. He essentially got away with murder because people liked him as a football player.
PS4,fpq5pza,t1_fpq3sc3,1588815694.0,"That's a mature way of looking at it but the internet is notorious for blowing small things out of context and making them seem like something people should get hung up on. People accuse the left of doing this (which no doubt many of them do engage in outrage culture) but the far right are the ones mostly ensuring that the internet become a toxic cess pit. I mean fuck, when they say that people shouldn't believe everything they've read or heard on the internet, people need to take something like that seriously. Truth is so heavily distorted these days by way of cancel and outrage culture. The internet it seems has been taken over by whiny adult crybabies that project their anger in the absolute most vile and immature way possible. Fuck, by now it should be clear that even if TLOU2 was a genuinely bad game, the people throwing a shit fit would still be in the wrong. At the end of the day it makes absolutely no sense to get this worked up over a very minute and arbitrary detail. I haven't seen much of the leaks, but has anyone ever considered that the leaker edited the clips together to make it look as bad as it could possibly be? I never see this prospect brought up in these kinds of threads. Fuck with all of the misinformation we do have, we know certain parts are untrue, like the supposed trans woman thing. Plus if people really thought with logic and not with their fragile egotistical emotions, they'd realize that ND has made another great game and that what the internet is doing is just a blatant fuck up of cancel culture. What reason would Neil or ND or Sony have to deceive us? The things that people accuse ND of being and how evil they are are really just outrage culture (on the right) run amoc and aren't as bad as they seem. Like there's no reason to believe that Amy Hennig was forced out or Neil treated her like shit, but they fail to provide a source that directly points to Neil being the reason for it. Also realize that a lot of gamers are heavily invested in the alt right and likely weren't LOU fans in the first place, so they come up with the idea that ND has an agenda by simply including people of different backgrounds. So of course they're gonna blow it out of proportion and eat up bullshit despite it being proven false. 

I'm not saying that the game will be a masterpiece (anymore than any other game could or couldn't be) but judging the game based on what is essentially things people see/hear on the internet, which is pretty fucking stupid."

PS4,fppxcu4,t1_fpo3e35,1588810986.0,"UC is violent the way the A Team is violent. Granted I absolutely love Uncharted, but the violence in it isn't grounded in reality. TLOU on the other hand is a look into what evil every human being is capable of, and it isn't gonna be pretty. Every person you kill had a name and someone who cared about them who won't ever see them again. Expecting TLOU to be tame when it comes to violence is like expecting The Road to take place in a Disney style fairytale world."
news,fppvar8,t3_gequvk,1588809850.0,The fact that someone would kill someone over such a petty and minuscule thing shows that mankind is a very immature and childish species that exhibits a true brand of irredeemable savagery and malice that cannot be quelled or tamed no matter how much we try to pretend it can.

misanthropy,fppiyga,t1_fponw45,1588803134.0,"It also seems that anymore, people, particularly women from my experience, have become unbelievably superficial and materialistic because of things like online dating. It used to be that someone would settle if they had to deal with someone who's jaw wasn't 100% chiseled, didn't have cum gutters and wasn't 6'5. Now men want a woman with a giant rack and women want a man that is below 6'. Thank fuck I'm 6'1 and somewhat decent looking with a full head of hair. I lucked out with my looks and I'm *still* considered average and sub teir in the modern dating world. 

Also the internet and social media has ruined this world. It used to be that talentless, shit-for-brained and obnoxious people didn't have a platform to spew their vitriol, toxicity and misery to the world. Now with the WWW people who shouldn't even have the right to be alive are talking nonsense from the rooftops and getting their cocks sucked off by gullible followers in the process. Here in Americs everyone complains how corporate media and biases are ruining the minds of the people, but the average person is just as much of a propaganda outlet as TV news is. And they have just as many biases too."

PS4,fpok7sq,t1_fpo0hdj,1588785890.0,"I don't know where people got the idea that TLOU was a bright and sunny exploration into father daughter territory. Hell the ending of TLOU made it seem like Joel ultimately didn't do the right thing. Are people under the impression that Joel and Ellie's actions aren't going to have consequences? This isn't Uncharted where you're mowing down person after person with no consequences. What they did is likely not gonna end well.

Plus bleak stories can be told very well. Hell reality in general is pretty bleak. Why else do you think that the writers of Chernobyl on HBO are the same ones attached to TLOU TV series? Did Chernobyl see characters that you care about meet pleasant ends? Of course not. Virtually all apocalyptic stories, aside from maybe if it's a comedy like Last Man on Earth or a cartoon like Adventure Time, have bleak and depressing tones. People are pulling most criticism of this game out of their asses. When they do manage any criticism, they are seemingly never able to point out *how* it's bad. They just say its really really bad without much of a reasoning behind it.

As for the trailer, it looks fucking awesome and I'm ashamed to call myself a gamer when it has the amount of dislikes it has."

So far, communism has failed the people it was ruling over. Until a better economic system is able to be introduced that doesn't have the pitfalls of either, I'm going with the lesser of the evils, which is capitalism."
PS4,fply475,t1_fplm4qk,1588721721.0,"Take the example of Beck. His lyrics aren't exactly that deep or groundbreaking, but the presentation and the fact that the dude can play like twenty different instruments and redefines himself with each new hit and album shows that he's damn good and talented. 

Likewise, even if TLOU2's story tanks (which TBH I'm pretty skeptical of that happening, ND have made every one of their stories stellar up to now), are people just completely forgetting the level of detail in the world? The atmosphere? The sense of uncertainty and anxiety you get when playing, not knowing what lies beyond each corner? The phenomenal voice acting? Did people just fucking forget that Neil made the first game and UC4 and Lost Legacy? 

Even still I think that the haters of this game are just oversimplifying what's happening and making mountains out of molehills. Hell I'm skeptical of half the shit I read about this game because so much of it is just blind hate of SJWs and wanting the game to fail and they likely weren't gonna buy the game anyway. And really guys, if your main criticism of the game is the story, then you're flat out failing at any constructive criticism. Virtually everything I've seen about this game has been from generic anti SJW alt right content and like farms on the internet. Also if I've learned anything from my time on the internet, its that likes, votes, etc don't mean Jack shit. I've seen comments that have nothing but civil discussion and facts drowned out by irrational vitriol because the professionally offended can't stand the fact that they may be wrong."
Enough_Sanders_Spam,fplsjm5,t1_fplozl4,1588718645.0,"That's what I don't get either. Unfortunately I feel it comes from a lot of disenfranchised demographics feeling that adopting far left dogma or communism will somehow help them and anything less is literal fascism. Americans in general fail to see gray areas anymore and fall into either a radical left or radical right ideology. I feel as if trans people adopting things like communism comes from the idea that all of American politics is 100% against them when it's clear that that's not true. Of course there's sensible people like you who thankfully see the more gray areas in American politics where you realize that just because you support Biden over Bernie or that capitalism isn't the only source of all human suffering, it doesn't mean you are a fascist or support Trump. I really just wish Americans had the ability to see the bigger picture and not just think with their emotions."

misanthropy,fplhso6,t3_g98fig,1588712951.0,I think its because the internet happened. Yeah human nature has always been shitty but these days legit all it takes is a keyboard or smartphone or whatever for one ordinary nobody to be as much of a propagandist as Goebbles was. The internet has led so many people astray. Nobody thinks for themselves anymore. People care more about bandwagoning their hate rather than just forming individual opinions. Things like art are so heavily ruined by group think and bandwagon hate that enjoying a piece of medium is ruined by humans. Things are much easier to enjoy when there isn't a barrage of worthless shitbags out to ruin the fun someone may have.

Just look at the amount of dislikes on the video of Neil simply talking about The Last of Us Part 2 going gold and you'll see how much of a fucked up and insane, completely uncalled for internet Lynch mob has formed around this game.

PS4,fpf0o1y,t1_fpetcd2,1588559069.0,"Here's a statement from Naughty Dog in 2014 about Amy Hennig's departure: 

*Earlier this week we had to confirm the regrettable news that Amy Hennig has left Naughty Dog.  She will be missed and, as we stated before, we appreciate the significant contributions that she has made to Naughty Dog and the industry in general.  We wish her the best.
However, we feel it necessary to clear up a very important point that was unprofessionally misreported when the story broke.  Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann were NOT involved in what transpired.  It was very upsetting to us that dozens of stories were run, linking back to the same hurtful accusations in the original report.  As co-presidents of Naughty Dog, we are responsible for all studio affairs.
Normally, we wouldn’t respond to rumors and speculation on matters that are internal to Naughty Dog, but because the personal reputation of two of our employees is being damaged we needed to set the record straight.  There is nothing left to be said on this subject.  Now we’re going back to what we should be focused on – making games.
Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra*

Note how Neil and company don't discuss rumors for upcoming games. And that Amy was not ""forced"" out of ND. Stop spreading blatant misinformation and bullshit. Plus the two games made without her were amazing. Kindly fuck off."

But has SIE or Sony had one studio that hasn't been successful through and through with their games? Insomniac, ND, Guerilla, Media Molecule, Sucker Punch, Santa Monic etc. have a pretty solid track record. Even the ""worst"" games that Sony has published or had developed from a first party studio still aren't what I'd call a straight up bad game. And this is Naughty Dog we're talking about! Every single game they've made under the Playstation and Sony banner has been phenomenal at best and, at worst, decent. There's no reason to not trust them. Skepticism is understandable. But the way many of these fuckers are just throwing them under the bus and completely shit talking them doesn't make sense. They legit haven't made a game that I didn't enjoy and that many others didn't enjoy. Much of this backlash isn't the healthy skepticism that it tries to sell itself as. Most of it is just lound mouthed trolls just brigading every corner of the internet and shutting down everyone who's excited for this game. That isn't healthy skepticism. That's childish trolling."
