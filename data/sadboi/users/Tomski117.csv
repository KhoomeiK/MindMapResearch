BrothersInArms,foqzzdw,t3_g91ibc,1588003793.0,Maybe the signs of a new game coming soon? I mean a TV show would hype everyone up to a new game
airsoft,fokwvq8,t1_fokkn5r,1587850487.0,"I'll have a gander at some, thanks for all your help mate, much appreciated"
airsoft,fokkji3,t1_fojzkjc,1587843782.0,Cheers mate
airsoft,fokkfaz,t1_fok2onf,1587843721.0,"Ok thanks for the help mate, although Ive owned Airsoft guns for years, this is the first gun I plan on upgrading anyhow so would you suggest just replacing certain parts? I've been planning on a spring, metal bushes, shims and a new nozzle anyway, I opened it up and it seemed to me that the cylinder head was leaking air."
airsoft,fojzzu6,t1_fojz7jg,1587832786.0,"The stock magazine is a midcap mag and it shoots good as normal but my extended mag is a highcap mag and I tried shooting it with only a full mag, half mag and still only 10/15feet. So is this the exact opposite of midcap syndrome?? Because I googled what you said and it seems to be highcaps feeding well but not mids?"
modernwarfare,fmzxm1w,t1_fmzxil2,1586531593.0,Pretty much how I play but any further and I ADS first
modernwarfare,fminp8g,t3_fviyok,1586113227.0,"You should defo try out the campaign but I don't think you need to install the campaign or spec ops packs to play multiplayer, I think yours should look like this :

Modern Warfare (99.3GB)
multiplayer pack 1 (5.9GB)
multiplayer pack 2 (9GB)"
modernwarfare,fmine8c,t3_fvj27x,1586113051.0,"Idk man but it's really annoying cos with most things in this game I'm like, ok if it takes a while to fix fine. But when they're STILL accepting people's money for it, knowing it's broken. That annoys me"
modernwarfare,fmhlxp1,t3_fvbfd5,1586085641.0,"Id love realism to come back, I'd play it exculsively"
modernwarfare,fmesj1i,t3_fuuxps,1586012531.0,"I don't think you'll be able to play it off the bat you'll need to install packs, etc. Campaign packs 1&2, multiplayer pack 1&2 and special ops packs 1&2. But once you've installed all that you'll be able to access warzone from MW and vice versa"
modernwarfare,fm8b3s2,t3_ftpgb9,1585846142.0,Depends on how much it is and how much you really want ghost I guess cos you won't be able to progress very far in the pass
modernwarfare,fm89pa5,t1_fm89gqk,1585845411.0,"Exactly, plus it's not like it's even a rare issue since TONNES of people have gotten the same issue since day one"
modernwarfare,fm85l4f,t3_ftouru,1585843231.0,"Nothing yet on my end still on the store it says it's £19.99 and I have no skin, guns or anything"
modernwarfare,fm859yu,t3_ftoqvi,1585843067.0,"Should have gotten it as soon as it was ordered but there's a bug not letting people use anything. I ordered it 2 days ago and still nothing, it's becoming a joke when they claim ""instant access"" but then that turns out to be BS."
Rainbow6,flmzg2v,t3_fpfa54,1585303168.0,I bought the season one pass and really thought it was a good pass but this one just feels incredibly lazy and unfinished
CODWarzone,fl7cunj,t1_fl6yzfn,1584899122.0,It's so annoying as well because warzones really fun but since I'm grinding the pass it's really not helping
CODWarzone,fl6obh0,t1_fl6n865,1584877736.0,Yeah that's what I want to do because I started this season late so I'm trying to quickly as possible max out the battlepass but warzone doesn't level it up for me now
modernwarfare,fl5p67w,t3_fmcs1y,1584842186.0,Same here hope it's fixed
BrothersInArms,fl5ojw9,t1_fl4y0oj,1584841746.0,Man I had that years ago!!!! Never finished it when I was a kid would love to get a DS and that game again

xbox,fi3dmsg,t3_f5uz0b,1582113010.0,I got a skin off Amazon cost me about £9.99
CrackWatch,fhhg5jh,t1_fhhexxm,1581603408.0,"Agreed, for me if it was properly optimised for console and pc (especially console) it would be a solid 9/10 (at its current state) hopefully they can fix these issues when KCD2 is made"
CrackWatch,fhhbvwi,t3_f39dsx,1581600311.0,"Well, I got a crack of this and then bought the royal edition at full price because this company (imo) deserve the money! Brilliant game"
BrothersInArms,fgqw1to,t1_fgp796n,1581032697.0,Yeah this is pretty spot on
BrothersInArms,fgot9nz,t3_ezpuna,1580985530.0,"Allied paratroopers were sent in with the aim to seize several key bridges across the Lower Rhine and secure entry into Germany.

The game pretty much follows this idea, so if I were you I'd be looking up the history of the 101st Airborne during market garden. Plus you can watch gameplay and read walkthroughs on the game and comment on the accurate uniforms, missions, weaponry, armoured vehicles, and the entire story is pretty great. What you need to remember is the 101st were only a small percentage of paratroopers involved, so remember to write about the involvement of British and (I believe) Canadian forces. There's a couple of missions which at the time really made me interested in the war. I think you should either pick up a copy or watch a play through and take notes on: dates, operations, bridges, enemy troops, tanks etc. And compare it to your notes on the real history. I think you'll find it surprising how close it was for a game. Good luck and if you have any questions let me know :)"
G2A_Help,fgkd1gr,t1_fgizkgs,1580862727.0,"If it's magnumkeys I just told him id be involving the authorities and getting him done for fraud.... Then I immediately got a refund request... Plus if it's through Xbox then Microsoft live chat can identify when the code was redeemed, and if it was from your account. That should be enough proof. So basically a screenshot of your Microsoft live chat, a picture of your receipt (which will include the time of purchase) then you'll have enough proof, then just tell him if he doesn't respond you'll be telling the police ( mention you have his name, address and tax number- you can find that info on your receipt) I think it'll get his butt in gear"
G2A_Help,fft7k6d,t1_ffrzntx,1580211043.0,I also JUST got banned from the g2a subreddit for posting that the seller I used isn't to be trusted! With literal proof man. All the sellers positive reviews are because the seller has scammed someone and then requested they change the rating to good before they help.... What a joke
G2A_Help,fft7ec8,t1_ffrzntx,1580210838.0,"Exactly mate, I've only saved a few quid here and there so I won't be using them again, as soon as I get my money back"

G2A_Help,ffqk5qe,t3_eukv4u,1580136812.0,"If I was you I would just delete your G2A account and never use it again, I'm in the same boat and even tho I have a screen shot from Microsoft support showing that the game I bought was redeemed by a different user over 2 hours after I bought it (again with a screenshot of my receipt SHOWING I bought it two hours after it was already redeemed I just get the same old copy and paste rubbish from the so called ""support"" from all the things I've seen g2a don't care about the buyers on the site, I've spent well over £150/200 on g2a before and alls well but the moment I need help with a seller scamming me I just get ""oh send a police report"" even after my evidence which is literally THERE. Nah seriously after seeing the help users get I'll never be using the site ever again."

modernwarfare,f5bfd23,t1_f5bdcwl,1572120755.0,Ohhhh I don't know but I just thought it was interesting because if you zoom in it does look like a menu with captain price standing behind crates AND it was on the store page...
