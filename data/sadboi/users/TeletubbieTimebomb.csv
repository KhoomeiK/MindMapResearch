BeautyBoxes,fb4t67y,t3_ebhh90,1576515070.0,Yes! Waiting on two actually. Both were just marked as shipped yesterday even though according to FedEx they were shipped on December 6. One is scheduled for delivery tomorrow (but I have my doubts) and the second is due on Saturday. I hope your box arrives soon!!

childfree,ey0yqhx,t3_cuu1s1,1566685823.0,"Late to the party, but cats are a zillion times better than children for numerous reasons. For example, I know that I’ll never get a call from the police that my cat got a DUI. I’ll never have to take one of my cats to an abortion clinic, or worry about one of them getting addicted to hard drugs. I’ll never have to shell out cash for braces or driving lessons or school pictures or prom or college for my cats. Plus my cats don’t talk endlessly or require constant attention. I don’t understand why people reproduce."

antinatalism,ev9nluq,t3_ciufq7,1564326582.0,"People typically fear what they do not understand. Fear leads to anger which is fueled by stupidity which leads to hostility. 

I also think there may be a twinge of jealousy because I think very few breeders actually realize what raising a child entails and none of us were stupid enough to walk blindly into reproduction."
AskDocs,euk1pa8,t3_cgm2d8,1563881952.0,Not a doctor but I was on Cymbalta for about a year and I heard whatever songs had been on the radio that day playing faintly in my ears.. I chalked it up to the medication because the music stopped once I switched back to Celexa. It may be a side effect of the Paxil?

My sister is notorious for both and it takes all the will power I have not to scream in her face that she CHOSE to make that child and that it never asked to be here. She is a terrible adult who should’ve never reproduced, but, here we are :("

Edit: Also, did you make a throwaway account JUST to reply to my comment? Coward."
atheism,erysisy,t1_eryrry0,1561416306.0,"In this case I laugh to keep from crying. Really though, I wish so badly that this is just a phase but the things she says sound like straight mental illness. She truly feels that therapy is a “waste of time” and sees nothing wrong with her delusional line of thinking. In her world the earth is flat, vaccines are poison and chemtrails are the reason the summer days have longer daylight hours. Between that and her “personal connection to god” I’m not convinced she’ll move on any time soon :( how we are sisters with the same DNA is beyond me."

MedicalGore,eoz4oss,t1_eoxy007,1558954968.0,"You’re not wrong, but dental care is NOT cheap. Especially when you’re not insured. I brush twice a day and floss every night and I still needed a cavity filled at my last visit. Preventative maintenance only goes so far. And even WITH insurance dental care can still be expensive - My insurance only covered amalgam fillings, which my dentist no longer does, so it was on me to cover the difference in cost. When you’re a college student earning $10.25 an hour that $83 difference feels expensive. Now that I’m uninsured again I’m brushing extra thoroughly."
