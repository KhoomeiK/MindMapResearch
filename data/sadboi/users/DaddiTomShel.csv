mentalhealth,fblrm0p,t3_edr9q8,1576968478.0,"I guess it goes with a lot people who are the minority of the group. That bad image resonates louder than ""good"" or ""better"" image. Sadly people grad harder on the bad side and push on than more than actually focusing on the people who really need help. It's a shame.

 It also is a shame when people are out there trying to grab attention this way when there is others who actually need the focus, it's not okay.

The few can ruin it for the majority and it is really sad to see that happen. Also other's can be afraid to step up and out in the real so they act ""attention grabby"" but actually need help. Though they don't know how to properly express it.

Also some people don't see mental health as a huge issue so they themselves could easily turn some way cause they see it as a form of attention grabbing.

We really need to better educate people on deciphering from what is what and slow down before we cast judgment or an opinion."

mentalhealth,f70lu75,t3_dtx8u9,1573329862.0,"Sorry that you feel that way and that this your of a way out of it. In reality suicide is a common thing many many people think about on a daily occurrence. 
The difference is if you go out and try to do something to fix it. I see that you view therapy as a scam and your issues are permanent... well that is one way you can view things. To want help and get help, you have to go out and get it. Now I am not saying you haven't cause I don't know you. You clearly could have and it's not worked. 
Also you may not have loved ones or close friends but you are a person so Even unbeknownst of you, you have someone who cares. It may not be vocal (sadly) but there is 7.5+ billion people on this planet. Everyone has a someone. And it will pass on a type of pain to them if you do commit suicide.
Now mental illness is permanent for most of the illnesses, yes true but there is offered help. You say you are from Germany, I don't know what help is like over there but there's help outside of Germany. People who are beyond willing to take a call, email, or a letter. Finding away to meet face to face. Someone does care cause there's to many people who exist for there not to be. Even just simply messaging someone so you can just talk helps a ton of individuals.

It can almost be like a dam. The mind is built to handle only do much trauma...to shove it down, lock it away, build walls, etc. Till it cracks and falls apart. We can definitely see that as season 4 and 5 go on. His dam is basically at it's breaking point.  His mind is at the capacity it can take if everything he's been through, childhood, the war, the deaths, and now this...it's to much.
Like it said and you said, it was slow progressing. He was ""good"" in the beginning. Then it added up. He couldn't get out of that downward spiral he got into.
Him with the gun to his head was the dam breaking and him feeling it all just collapsing, and he doesn't know how to deal with that.

I am also curious to see what will happen next. In reality he would generally just been shoved into an asylum, or some even had surgery done there brains (not successful at all). Maybe be left as a mess/shell of a human being.

I got the registrated part but I assumed by registered they meant just for signing up for the war not actually going into the war. I also thought they might have but again I'm not entirely sure. I'm just going off if it was a full 4 years of serving. 
I do see what you are saying. Younger around 16-18 sometime during 1916. And then serving two years (which is what some of the men did. Not all but yeah)
Probably did...I'll have to look more into this.

He can always beat another man. Shooting Mosley didn't have to be all that complicated, legitimate or not, but Tommy assumes that this could be the man...or is it. At the end he's second guessing if Mosely is that guy, some say it's Michael, others say it's the Billy Boy's. What happens if he just is putting it together and seeing that he can't defeat himself? Every single time death comes waving hello, Tommy finds a way to live and it's frustrating. 

The end where he's screaming in the field with the gun. He's finally at the point where he is, and in my opinion this was a perfect representation of a man who's mind is just cracked and falling apart, at a crossroads. A end? Maybe a very deep depression that he can't climb out of because he doesn't know how to by himself. 

He can't defeat that man cause it's him and he doesn't know how to stop, all though he, deep down, wants to. 

Also second thought, the episode is called Mr. Jones. Is it possible Tommy might try or just go  and disappear for a bit and then come back? Like a big foreshadow/cliffhanger. He's in a field and only Arthur knows he went for a ""walk"".

-- WW1 (1914) - Thomas was 24
-- Ending of WW1 (1918-19) - Thomas was 28
