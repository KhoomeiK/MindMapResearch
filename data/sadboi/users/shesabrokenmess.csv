Ash trees have deep x's in the bark, Elm trees have feet, Poplar trees are super straight and the branches tend to look like a umbrella and are way high up, Sycamores are white o  top amd grow near water sources mainly.

So I am always finding stuff in the oddest of places. I have to write everything down or take pics of it. The worst part for me is I can just drop off what I am saying mid sentence and have zero memory of what i was saying. My partner always makes fun of me cause I always just end up saying 'Umm'. It drives me crazy though.

I have always accounted it to be a result of trauma. My therapist once said my flight or fight was broken. So I have always thought that it is just a thing my brain has conditioned me to do. With the long term trauma my brain trained itself to not remember the bad things, only after long periods of time doing this it is just now how my brain functions in a everyday way.
