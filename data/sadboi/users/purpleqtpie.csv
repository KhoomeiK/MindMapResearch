Subliminal,fevcg9b,t3_eqm0fc,1579395776.0,"Me! (: 

After college on the job search I listened to subs. and meditated daily to set my mind on landing a career. I found it helped keep me positive and I eventually landed a recruiting job where I was able to grow. I used the same technique recently while applying for a top tech company and I actually got an offer last week!!! 

Itâ€™s all about mindset and letting go! Itâ€™s crazy how powerful the mind is!! 

Let me know if you have any questions."
