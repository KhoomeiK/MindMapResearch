>This is also against lore

Someone else also said that shapeshifting like beast tribes use and pomanders give could explain it - just say that a group of people saw the effects then learnt how to harness transformation for themselves and boom you're suddenly lore-friendly.

There could be a way to do it without going full-on primal. Summoners bring egis of various primals without getting the real thing so theoretically someone could do the same but they learn to use it to transform themselves instead of summon."
ffxiv,fr0fsb4,t1_fr04qja,1589794069.0,"With the first point the example could kind of work. As far as I remember, SMN draws upon the essence and ideas of primals to summon them, albeit in the form of a tiny little egi instead of the full thing. It could be possible to use that power to transform instead of summon.

That being said, the second explanation is more simple. There are plenty of examples of shapeshifting in the game so it would make perfect sense for a group of people to look at others say ""hey, we might be able to figure out a way to do this ourselves"" or use their own magic to achieve the same effects as pomanders but extended+stronger.

Ran'jit was some general from some nation we didn't even know existed before now and was overpowered just so we could have constant stakes or something (despite that we were already fighting to save a world and sineaters being pretty scary already)."
unpopularopinion,fql6bxz,t1_fql4tsi,1589447787.0,"It's the need to feel better than someone else. That person that's doing worse than me must've made worse decisions and they'd be exactly where I am if they were smarter! 

They're not worse off because they were born to a bad family or have some illness or got unlucky in life because then I couldn't justify why I deserve what I have in life while they're on the streets."
unpopularopinion,fql5xca,t1_fql3jel,1589447382.0,"Sounds a lot less exciting thinking about it as just ""Smith's"" instead of ""Ferrari"""
unpopularopinion,fql5okc,t1_fql43mh,1589447135.0,So image a bin. Then imagine people putting stuff in it. Then it gets removed because people put too much stuff in it (which is the point of the bin) so people throw their stuff on the ground instead.
ShitpostXIV,fql521w,t1_fqkwgic,1589446507.0,If they're 480 then they're probably level 80 running it for rewards. It's also still pretty decent because once you're done with it you can do other things (roulettes or highest non-50/60/70 dungeon if you used them all).
ShitpostXIV,fql4pwh,t1_fqjoprz,1589446169.0,"Melee need aoes so much sooner than they get them. Monk and Samurai get them at 26, which is pretty slow, but Ninja and Dragoon don't get them until 38 and 40 respectively. Why is that a thing?"
ShitpostXIV,fql48vv,t1_fqksto1,1589445691.0,"Level sync is annoying but makes sense. They don't want new players to do worse just because they don't have all their fancy tools from 80 in level 15 content. 

Gear sync is a bit ridiculous though, just sync it to give stats equivalent to the level and if it's max level content then don't sync gear at all."
AreTheStraightsOK,fqjaoef,t3_gixtfm,1589407320.0,"The spoon is one thing. You should be able to trust the person you're with but whatever, it's nice to have proof.

Suggesting that they'd take a picture like that in advance though, just in case? Wtf is wrong with people?"
ShitpostXIV,fqises1,t1_fqh65by,1589400242.0,I personally can't learn to do things very well from guides alone. If I'm following a guide then I'll still usually need to practice a little bit to get everything to click in my head.
ShitpostXIV,fqipart,t1_fqge16g,1589399052.0,"Also, even if they do care there's a decent chance you'll never see each other again and if you do see each other again they probably won't remember you."
