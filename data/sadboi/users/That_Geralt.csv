depression,f0el8f3,t3_cwl19g,1568570015.0,"To people commenting they won't do it because of their relatives, but hope it would happen, ex. when crossing the street - what difference does it make? Your mother, brother, whatever, will still see your body and experience everything.

Sure, they won't know you wanted to kill yourself, but isn't it worse that they dont know you just didn't want to live anymore since there is no point and all the things you have to do between(working, taking care of yourself and stuff) just make you suffer?

IMO the only thing one can do is to either luckily get a cancer or become an addict of some sort, become the burden of any sorts, make them hate you, make them feel peace when you go, that's the only thing that could sort of relieve their pain when they see you go. Random death is just saving your hands of blood, but in the end it doesnt matter since you'are already fucking dead."
depression,f0eadt9,t3_d4iik7,1568565431.0,"Hey man, I'm not going to tell You to live just because I don't want You to kill yourself, that's kind of blank and meaningless, something most people just feel they should say when one wants to leave the herd, but that's what makes suffering people feel worse, since they are being assured that they are supposed to live, even if not for themselves.

What I am going to ask You is just to give it at least another day of thoughts, or a week, or a month, hopefully a whole life, but at minimum, another day with clear head, no negative impulses and definitely no depressants of any sort, not because everything will be better in future(I can't know that), but because I can hear emotions going through your text, I can hear You(or at least some part of You) want to live, not the way You live right now, but You DO want to live and enjoy stuff, You just don't have it at this very moment. Yet.

Of course, taboo doesn't exist and it's ok to think of every way on horizon, but basing on my past, I can assure You, that future You would be disappointed of making this kind of decission emotionally, there's many things I enjoyed in time that passed since I was in similar state as You and tried to do something in rush.

This sub is filled with people who comment on how happy they are and how much they regret what they wanted to do in past, their attempt to give up(luckily they have failed this very specific task), so please do yourself a favour,  and read some of them, read about dark places they were in before, then read about their current lives where they enjoy almost every single day.

Sure, not everyone is happy through the life, but guess what - most of people are at every moment. Some have breakdowns now, some do later, some don't at all, but at every time, there's much more people enjoying the life than those who don't. If You make a decission while being emotional, You will never know how enjoyable are the things You want. There's no easy part in getting back on your feet when fighting the depression, that's the burden I'm sorry You have to carry, but You have the hardest part behind You - You do want something, for example - You want to love someone and have someone love You back, You also want to be better since You compare yourself to others.

""Someone for everyone"" is no bullshit, just don't consider it being a fairy tale of another piece of apple waiting for You somewhere, be realistic, look at some of the couples, some aren't even a good fit, yet many of them manage to live a happy, loving life together.

""Someone for everyone"" is more of a hint that no matter who You are, if You try to be the best version of yourself, for yourself and for the people you meet on every step of your life, there are going to be people interested in You if given impulse and little luck, some of these relations would evolve into love after some time, some would not. It's important not to expect love before it comes, just ""give love"" to people You feel good with, give love to yourself, because if you love yourself, it's easier to love you back. Then decide if that's the place where You want to be now, even if You don't get back what You want at the very moment. (It's healthy to have your limits too, of course, because if they have been met, one should consider that maybe two of people just don't match together and that you'd be happier with someone else).

About You stating You have no qualities - I know people who wouldn't be able to give as many thoughts as You listed in this thread to anything at all, yet they are happy and earning good money in corporations. You can write pretty well and You can think, the second one is the only one required for other skills to come up when You try new stuff. Don't compare, don't drop things just because someone is much better at them, if You feel good with something, continue, improve and eventually You will be surprised Past You was so worried about something this small.
