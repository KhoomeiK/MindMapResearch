For treating the fleas: you can order a variety of inexpensive treatments on Amazon.  Many of the ones suitable for cats are suitable for rats (though as I'm not a vet, I would recommend double-checking this).

Next you'll need to do a complete deep cage clean to get rid of any lingering bugs and the eggs.  For the bedding, if you wash it at 60degC at least, this should destroy any eggs.  Alternatively (and in addition if you like), if you have a big enough freezer you can bag the bedding and freeze it for a couple of days.  Again, destroys the eggs.
