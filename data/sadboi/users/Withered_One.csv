The Aztecs had human sacrifices and if it still happened today it should still be stopped and considered barbaric. Regardless of politics, there's rules for humans to be civil and not savages and if your religion makes you treat women like trash, or run around killing innocent people and blowing things up, then you're an asshole and need to change your ways and you need to stop oppressing people. This goes for Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and anywhere that tempts people to saying 'iT'S tHeIr cUltUrE aNd tHeiR chOiCe'"
