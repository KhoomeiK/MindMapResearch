Ultimately. I think to do the story any justice at all, it requires adiosisual telling in a serialised anime from the likes of Studio Ghibli or old school Akira Toriyama or even in the style of Hunter X Hunter."

I have made a bucket filter with a 2000lph pump. I know I hold about 500l so should be fine.
I plan to put tall reeds behind the hard scape and maybe some lillys up front.
I'd like advice on stocking and at this stage, more importantly, how to really dress this up for cheap and keep it portable for future vacating.
We are in South East NSW, the pond gets little direct sunlight as it's against a north facing fence. Thank you to anyone who offers advice. I keep planted aquariums indoors. But new to ponds."
