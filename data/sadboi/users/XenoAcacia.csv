Of course it's not the chipper little birds and the soft light, it's my own internalized feelings towards what they are ""supposed"" to signify versus what they signify to me that gets me down.

DevinTownsend,fp0r8po,t3_gafnbc,1588215153.0,"""I don't wanna bother your moonlight"" is one of my favourite, if not my very favourite ""love song"" lyrics.  To me, it presents love without that too often romanticized and frankly unhealthy ""consuming"" component.  Ya know, the whole ""baby, you're my world!"" trope.  It recognizes that we love people for their own ""light"" that existed within them before we were ever there to observe it.  And it's a very mature outlook on love in that it acknowledges that the connections we form with othersâ€”particularly falling in loveâ€”will alter who we and they are.  It professes that, while you want to be with this person, you don't want to consume them; you ""don't wanna bother their soul.""  To me, it's not about literally ""bothering"" the person, it's about disrupting the essence that is *theirs* which drew you to them to begin with.  It's an expression of longing for unity without that desire for posession that we frequently hear about/feel in romantic endeavours.  

It has brought me to tears with how pure an expression it is (and I'm generally not a love song gal) and it's something I always have in the back of my mind when I get thinking about love."

Of course it is always best to be cautious when it comes to stopping chronic use of any gabaergics; seeking medical help is always advisable and I'm glad you've addressed that.

I don't know that I would say it was triggered by my psych use as it's been many years since I've had a substantial trip and it's only in recent years that this feeling has become a constant presence.  The past few years, though, I've struggled on and off with heavy physical alcohol dependency; so I personally would attribute it more to that.  Although I'd say it's likely that being in a constant (or frequent) altered state of conciousness, regardless of the method used to induce that state, would constitute an apt cause.  But I have been toiling recently with the idea of another heavy trip in the hopes that it may *undo* the feeling.  Though I do worry that, like you, I'll visit some place that I wind up just waiting/longing for; and I'll be all the worse for it.

On that note, I do have to ask what your experiences with ayahuasca have been like?  I've researched aya extensively and reports from people afflicted with BPD are all but nonexistent.  Apart from the aforementioned ""what's next"" feeling, have you found it's helped with other aspects of your mindset?
