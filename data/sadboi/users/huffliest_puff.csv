I had a medical abortion where you take mifepristone and then I think 24 hours later you have to take misoprostrol. If I could go back and do it again I would have had a surgical abortion because the uterine contractions that cause you to expel the pregnancy were very painful for me. I feel like the clinic did not adequately prepare me for the amount of pain I would be in which is the only reason I'm telling you, not to scare you. If you have any questions feel free to PM me, or even if you just need emotional support throughout the process."
