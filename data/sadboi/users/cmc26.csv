APPsychology,fkt8l8w,t3_fj37b5,1584509685.0,"Hi! I took the AP Psychology exam last year and got a 5. My best tips are probably 
1. Use Albert.io. The questions are harder but it therefore prepared me for the exam quite well - I was able to finish the multiple choice section in about 20 minutes since I was used to Alberts more difficult questions. 
2. Take practice exams from Barrons & Princeton & other credible sources. The key part here is to see what you got wrong - it saved me. 
3. YouTube Crash Courses! Helpful in saving time & reviewing right before the test. These saved me. 
4. WikiNotes: just look up WikiNotes AP Psychology. They have everything summarized & neatly categorized into the units. I used these throughout the year. 

Good luck! :)"
