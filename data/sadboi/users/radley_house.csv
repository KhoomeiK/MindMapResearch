narcissism,fji8hgz,t1_fj6ktns,1583362400.0,My father is undoubtedly a narc and realizing that at 25 freaked me out and I started to see how periods of my adult life where I've tried to be his hero again i wasnt actually acting like myself and i have alot of remorse of how i treat life when I'm focused on staying on his good side. I feel so much shame when i disappoint him and I've never really understood how that's affected my ability to create a life for myself

Enneagram,fa824ab,t3_e5dm77,1575840318.0,"It took me awhile. I got interested in enneagram over the summer and typed as a 4w5, but over the course of a couple months I studied every type just to see if one fit better. I ended up concluding I was a 4w5, but it dawned on me that the enneagram had become the theory that I used to see the entire world for awhile. I was so engulfed in it, and it was empowering because it was steadier than previous methods I had used to understand the world. Then I realized just how much time i've spent in my life researching social behaviors, myself, philosophy, systems of belief, and concluded that I really have a 5w4 personality."
depression,f9ay4lw,t1_f98zv4j,1575207516.0,"You dont have to be entertaining, cool, and fun. I can say with certainty that the majority of folks on this sub would rather be around someone else and there are many more like us out there. 

That's such a bullshit myth that your worth in the world is based on your occupation. So many people would rather have a deep meaningful conversation with a McDonalds employee than a transactional exchange of surface level chatter with a stock broker or a metaphorical dick contest driven by an unconscious desire for social status with a political candidate. There are lots of people who dont need to be entertained or entertain, that just want something real"

depression,f9avp1x,t3_e4ff3o,1575206877.0,"As difficult as it is to see the world collapsing all around us, remember that you and me alone can't change that. It's hard to watch a world that seems so engulfed in bullshit content, trivial matters, over consumption. It sort of sucks, but ultimately you can only control yourself and your own actions. I know depression makes it difficult to muster the energy to do anything, but do you have interest in fighting for one of those causes? It could give you a sense of purpose that alleviates a sense of despair. I've struggled with nihilism and emptiness for half my life, so if you ever need an ear, hit my dm. Keep going my friend"
depression,f9au5c4,t3_e4bf73,1575206430.0,"Keep going friend. Remember that those times when harmful thoughts run wild can lead to personal insights. What thoughts and feelings arise when you want to self harm? What things can you do and what have you done that keep those thoughts away? Do you have people you can call and be honest about how you are feeling? I went through a similar phase as a teenager where self harm seemed utterly dumb and ridiculous, until my depression made me feel so numb that inflicting pain on myself was the only way I could feel anything. After therapy and putting in work to be more balanced emotionally and mentally, I'm back in a place where self harm just isn't something I want or need to do. But figuring out why I self harmed in the first place and working through that was crucial for me"

depression,f9as99c,t3_e466xi,1575205845.0,"Something that's helped me shift through what is depression and what is me is personality typing, specifically enneagram. For example, with my type, a baseline mood for me is often meloncholy and my type has a tendency to withdraw from others in times of stress. On the outside, that's stereotypical of depression but at the same time that's also a tendency of my personality type. So, even when I'm healthy, I still tend to withdraw to regain energy. If this clicks at all, I can explain more, I really like enneagram"

ISTJ,f34j6ys,t3_dewaff,1570655271.0,"Being able to make better decisions not basing off of emotions may not mean you are a different type. It could be that you are still an infp but have grown as an individual. I imagine infps identify with their emotions more than other types, and I know that enneagram type 4s (commonly infps) grow by learning to identify their existence less with their feelings and learning to use their feelings for self betterment. Try an enneagram test and see what type correlates"
Enneagram,f34iahb,t3_dff9ua,1570654700.0,"Im a 1w9. I try and use that inner voice as a guide instead of an instrument of self-berating. It's chanting that you are a failure because ultimately you could have done the thing better. You're not a failure, but that inner critic is harsh and will lead you to believe you've hugely failed. But if you use that voice for self construction instead of self destruction/deprication, I bet you'll find that the inner critic isnt as condemnatory as it seems. Just think: if you are a type 1, you will have that inner critic that balks at anything short of perfection. But that inner critic isn't you. Its your mind, superego, conscience, etc. Have you tried mindfulness? I've found it makes it alot easier to separate my conscious mind from that inner critic. And I've actually found that if I separate myself from the inner critic, it can be a helpful tool to make things better around me. Hope something in this helps!"
