depression,fdrkn49,t3_emmfkf,1578685805.0,"Depression is (in my personal experience) where the days feel...pointless.  You want to cry out for help, but then you think ""no, I'll be a burden and I dont want that"" or calling yourself names that people have called you in the past and believe them. It's where you skip basic hygiene for 3 4 or 5 or hell, even weeks because you just dont care. Depression is where you want to feel something, but yet you feel way too much at the same time. In severe cases, depression is where the only thing you think about is ""I wanna die"" which turns into ""I wanna kill myself' which turns into an actual suicide attempt. And if that attempt fails, you feel shitty and want to try again. Depression is where you cry so hard in the middle of the night that you have to cover your own mouth so nobody will hear you. 

I hope this helps, feel free to ask any questions."

selfharm,fcyp8u6,t3_ejby90,1578084311.0,"So, from personal experience I can tell you why she MIGHTVE done it, but I'm not her so I cant tell you exactly. 

  This happened because she was feeling too much of her feelers, or she was just completely numb and wanted to feel something. To make sure this doesnt happen again, make sure you let her know how important she is to you. If she told you that, dont tell anyone else. Most of the time people are ashamed that they did something like that. 

Your second question of if she is safe now. She is safe. But, there is ALWAYS a chance of relapse. Self harm becomes an addiction if done for so long. But, it seems like she has overcome this struggle and is now stronger.

AskReddit,f8h5xnu,t3_e0odv9,1574569936.0,"Depression will make you want to kill yourself. Some people will joke about ""oh I got a 60 on my English test, I'm gonna kill myself"" where as in us with depression will be like ""just another reason to fucking die""    Sometimes our suicide urges get so strong they keep us up at night. No sleep med or anxiety med will calm the mind of someone who wants to die. Also, it's not easy as ""just be happy"" like if it were that fuckin easy, we all wouldve done been happy now. We are not lazy. We just literally cannot find the reason, energy, motivation or benefit of getting out of bed. Another thing, sometimes basic hygiene is the most DRAINING thing in the world. For the parents, and I really hope someone sees this part, parents, any type of adult figure, or even if you're an adult yourself, praying away the depression or any other mental illness will not make it go away.  When we say we are _______(fill in name. Such as worthless) and you say ""no you're not"" we dont believe that we are worthy. No amount of compliments will make anybody's self esteem rise. One other thing, when we tell you our feelings dont get mad, annoyed, frustrated, sarcastic with them. It makes us feel stupid then makes us feel worse. One last thing, the cutting, burning, bruising, hitting, punching, stabbing, pinching, biting, hair pulling, nail ripping, carving harsh words into our skin, restrictive eating or anything else is NOT for attention seeking. Try understanding why they did so, make them throw away any blades, needles, knives or any other self harm utensil, go to an ER or call an ambulance if necessary and get assessed.
