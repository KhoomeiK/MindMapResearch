So around the time BTD6 released, I was hyped and ready to download it. I didn’t know what it was gonna have. I tried over and over, but for some reason it would let me download it because there was an IOS requirement. I was so mad that my -999 IQ brain decided to quit the series. However around three months ago I saw BTD6 again, not remembering about what previously happened, and tried again. It downloaded. After a while of playing BTD6, I remembered, and felt even happier to have the game. And that’s why I’m here today. Because I didn’t know what was impossible, so here’s my advice. Expect higher than what is possible, and you can accomplish way more, but that’s just me."

btd6,fp7nooy,t1_fp7my3m,1588374102.0,"It’s complicated. It depends on how you beat CHIMPS on the map. You want a black border, not a gold border.

To get either one, you must have all the medals on a map. To get a black border, you must play through CHIMPS without going back to the menu and reloading it. Basically, you can’t reload the game. If you do reload the game, you’ll get a gold border."

It’s abilities to remove ddt camo and do lots of damage to MOAB-Class bloons are amazing, but it costs lots of money to be able to get. You could spend it on other useful towers for late game. Even shattering shells is better because it may not be able to effect BFBs and DDTs or higher, but it doesn’t use about a quarter of the money you get the entire game."

Peirce: 1
Pops 2 layers per shot
Can’t pop: camo, lead
(Makes $60 in between rounds)

Teir 1: Double tap
300$

400$
Gives you more  cash every round. (Gives you 100$ in between rounds.)

Teir 3: Attrition
3250$
Takes away health from MOAB-Class bloons. (All MOAB-Class bloons spawn with 15% less health.) (Can’t effect BADs)

6000$
Heavier MOAB-class bloons move much slower (makes all MOAB-Class bloons move 30% slower.) (Can’t effect BADs.)

Teir 5: Finish Him!
56500$
MOAB-Class blooms beware. (Every MOAB-Class bloon spawns with 30% less health and is 46.5% slower. MOABs spawn no children and BFB’s and DDT’s have a 15% chance to spawn no children either. any monkey in its range does extra damage to ceramics and higher. You now get 500$ in between rounds.)

Path 2:

Teir 1: Defensive Boost
$350
Gives monkeys in its radius a small boost. (Towers in the COBRA’s radius get +1 pierce)

Teir 2: BANG!!!
400$
It’s gun is so loud, bloons get distracted and move in the wrong way to get away from the CORBA.
(When it shoots, bloons in its radius go the wrong way. How’s it so loud that bloons hear it? Idk.)

Teir 3: Monkey Stim
3450$
Reduces ability cooldowns everywhere and gives a range boost. (The COBRA’s range increases to the same as a 0-2-0 super monkey. It also reduces ability cooldowns everywhere by 15%. In range, Monkey’s attack 1.5 times quicker.)

Teir 4: Misdirection
$6000
Ability: sends the strongest bloon back to the start of the track. Ability cooldowns depends on the bloon. (Anything below a ceramic: 10 seconds.
Ceramic: 12
MOAB:25
BFB or DDT: 50
Can’t effect ZOMGs or BADs)

Teir 5: (idk what to name it):
38000$
sends three bloons back and now has a set cooldown.
(Now can send three bloons back. Can now effect ZOMGS and BADs. Now has a set cooldown of 30 seconds no matter the bloon.)

Path 3:

Teir 1: Scope
650$
Has a way bigger range.
(Has the range of a 0-1-0 super monkey. Monkey Stim’s range boost can add on to this.)

Teir 2: Thermal scope
850$
The COBRA’s range is boosted even further and can detect camo. (Now has the range of a 0-2-0 super monkey and can detect camo. If combined with Monkey Stim’s range boost, It can have lots of range, so I recommend that’s your crosspath.)

Teir 3: Spy
700$
The CORBA can spy on the bloons and show what they will send next round. (Reveals the RBE and bloons of next round. Not that good tbh.)

Teir 4: Bloon adjustment
2500$
Removes special properties from from every fourth non MOAB-Class bloon that spawns. (Self explanatory.)

Teir 5: Big bloon adjustment
$50000$
Can now effect MOAB-Class bloons with bloon adjustment. (Self explanatory. Also can remove DDT Camo.)"
