Benefits are:

* that it could be marketed to parents as something that'll help kids with school (this is how the Sinclair Spectrum kicked the Commodore 64's arse in the 1980s, despite having far worse graphics and sound, the 64 was a pig to code on)

Thing is, a lot of guys like me get discouraged from dating by being ghosted, messed about, getting radio silence, being expected to pay for everything etc. so I kind of quit a year ago to do my own thing. Since then I've focussed on work, creative stuff, my home, friends and family. I know a lot of other guys in the same boat too. 

This means that the only guys left in the ""dating scene"" are the needy and the desperate, the rakes and the players, or the odd new guy.

For example, out of 16 matches on Tinder, I got 3 who replied, then two just disappeared, and one date.

So do please be careful about relying on dating apps and sites. They're only there to sell subscriptions, and my personal view is that they've poisoned the well. 

I'd recommend spending relaxed time with friends and family, taking up yoga or a similar mixed-gender interest (but make sure you really enjoy it, you're not just going there to meet guys).

If you match with a guy, then do chat and reply to messages, but get out of Dodge fast if he wants nudes or gets nasty! Report these miscreants, they're screwing things up for all of us.

If you chat but don't want to meet, don't ghost or breadcrumb (see above): just be clear and firm: ""I'm not feeling a connection here, so I don't want to take things any further. I'd like to thank you for your chat and wish you all the best in your adventures. Take care."" You really have to be very blunt and to the pont. No dropping hints. 

Personally I always have a policy of giving everyone a chance to meet. It's not always worked out, but I've made some goid friends. It's a bit different for women though: meeting is a bigger ask I think.

That's actually a marketing decision though, rather than a technical limitation. The Xbox is still based on the Universsl Windows Platform (UWP), snd porting a UWP app to Xbox, and providing KBM support is not a huge re-engineering task.

Currently doing it myself, and it's really a matter of re-scaling the UI and making changes to the way storage us handled.

But, like you say MS has made a decision to focus on positioning the Xbox as a gaming-only device, I personally believe thats a bit of a mistake, given the technical scope of the device, and would rather they catered for a few more use-cases.

Same goes for any other dynamically loaded content, e.g. Twitter feeds.

Problems occur when you don't know the ad sizes in advance. So if you have multiple ad slots that vary between 250 and 600px height, then you'll get a lot of jankiness.

The same would happen with the money you save from Insurance. Even if you invested it in a fund that would stimulate business, before you eventually cashed it in an spent it on a yacht. 

Now, imagine your neighbour, bus driver or local corner store clerk got ill with coronavirus (or something), but avoided going to the docs because they didn't have insurance, and stayed in work because they had no sick leave. They're now a potential risk to the wider community,possibly infecting everyone they come into contact with. 

By contributing to universal or national healthcare, you actually benefit yourself in the long run. In the UK, that dude in the shop/bus whatever would have taken a couple of sickies and stayed home, and if he got really ill, off to A&E and an ICU. Much less of a threat.

*posted this yesterday, but I guess I got it in a bit late for last week. Hope it's OK to repost*

I play a lot of simulations and RPGs. I also often put a game down for a few months, and then pick it up again a few months later. By this time I have totally forgotten what I was doing, what the controls are and generally experience an annoying period of trying to remember how it all works.

To this end I have a few physical notebooks and strategy guides, and I always download the PDF manuals off the MS websites where available too. But that's all a bit of a pain. But it dawned on me that I always have my phone or a tablet handy while gaming, and I have the Xbox app on all of them so:

*Why not develop more game-centric aspects of the XBox App, and make it the essential gaming companion?*

What I'm proposing is the following for the mobile Xbox app. It's collated form other discussions I've had here, and also the feedback I gave MS about the app the last time they asked:

I did a [Rough sketch](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjKuAqISb98s5We3EGr2DPsUMwBf) to illustrate, but it came out looking a bit crap, so I may do something a bit more polished in Balsamiq or other wireframing tool.

**The Main Menu, add a ""My Games"" link**

Add a ""My Games"" link to the main Xbox app menu. It's always seemed to me to be a real oversight that it's so difficult to just get to a list of the games you own on the Xbox App. This menu link should open up the ""My Games"" list.

**The ""My Games"" list**

This view shows a sortable list of the games you own. Maybe pin some favourites to the top? List view or grid view? Or a flashy carousel? I dunno. A list is probably simpler and easier from a UX perspective. Anyway, selecting one of these leads you to an app page with a few other options.

**The Game Pages**

Each game has it's own page with the following options:

* License (e.g whether you purchased it outright digitally, on Disc, got it with Games With Gold or Gamepass)
   * Option to ""Buy to keep!"" if the game is from Games With Gold or Gamepass, linking to store.
* View edit Journal/Notepad (I'll use the term "" Journal"" here for consistency)
* View Control Scheme
* View Game Manual (if available)
* Buy/View Strategy Guide (if available)
* Watch on Mixer (opens Mixer)
* View Achievements
* Install/Uninstall
* Buy add-ons/DLC (opens relevant page in Store)

Unsure how best to arrange these from a usability perspective. Each one a tab with content underneath? Or a list? I chucked a list in my diagram because it was easier to draw, byt no doubt Microsoft has plenty of UXperts that can help with this.

**Game Journal**

A single Rich Text field for jotting down notes for spell potions, what you're doing in the game and other stuff. Free format, and optionally shareable.

This is something I've wanted for ages, and user u/hcgfh reminded me of it. As I mentioned earlier there are precedents for this in NeverWinter Nights, Baldur's Gate and Morrowind.

**View Control Scheme**

I always forget what the damned controls are in games. Having this easily available on tablet or phone while playing would be a boon.

**View Game Manual**

Game manuals are available on the MS site in PDF format. Games are getting a lot more complex these days, and I find them handy. This would also give publishers scope for adding value for their digital offerings as well. Heck, chuck in artbooks, novellas and little mini-encyclopedias of lore as well if you want.

**Buy/View Strategy Guide**

I don't kow how well Microsoft gets on with Prima, but they do some online strategy guides for their games, and that's what gave me the idea. They're interactive with little menus and maps and things, and pretty good for a few quid. Future Publishing release their guides on Kindle as well, and Microsoft did sell books at one point too.

An HTML format guide or eBook, or even PDF would be handy.

If Microsoft can sell them on the store, they could also form part of special offer bundles.

**View Achievements**

Does what it says on the tin: takes you to the list of your achievements in the game.

**Buy DLC**

Opens the store page for DLC for the game, or coins or other add-ons.

**Install/Uninstall**

Options to remotely install/uninstall remotely. Might be useful.

*....And breathe, I've finished...*

That's pretty much it. I just feel that the Xbox app is kind of useless for me. I genuinely don't care about clubs or the activity feed (I don't game to be social!), achievements are kind of 'meh'. I'd rather have something that 'helps me game'. The keyboard and the store are the only bits I ever use right now!

Anyway I'll stop now and leave it with you guys. And sorry for the crappy drawing!

xboxinsiders,fmzhyds,t3_fuatfz,1586520966.0,"**Xbox App functionality: My Games > Journal/Notepad, Manuals and Guides**

I play a lot of simulations and RPGs. I also often put a game down for a few months, and then pick it up again a few months later. By this time I have totally forgotten what I was doing, what the controls are and generally experience an annoying period of trying to remember how it all works.

To this end I have a few physical notebooks and strategy guides, and I always download the PDF manuals off the MS websites where available too. But that's all a bit of a pain. But it dawned on me that I always have my phone or a tablet handy while gaming, and I have the Xbox app on all of them so:

*Why not develop more game-centric aspects of the XBox App, and make it the essential gaming companion?*

What I'm proposing is the following for the mobile Xbox app. It's collated form other discussions I've had here, and also the feedback I gave MS about the app the last time they asked:

I did a [Rough sketch](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjKuAqISb98s5We3EGr2DPsUMwBf) to illustrate, but it came out looking a bit crap, so I may do something a bit more polished in Balsamiq or other wireframing tool.

**The Main Menu, add a ""My Games"" link**

Add a ""My Games"" link to the main Xbox app menu. It's always seemed to me to be a real oversight that it's so difficult to just get to a list of the games you own on the Xbox App. This menu link should open up the ""My Games"" list.

**The ""My Games"" list**

This view shows a sortable list of the games you own. Maybe pin some favourites to the top? List view or grid view? Or a flashy carousel? I dunno. A list is probably simpler and easier from a UX perspective. Anyway, selecting one of these leads you to an app page with a few other options.

**The Game Pages**

Each game has it's own page with the following options:

* License (e.g whether you purchased it outright digitally, on Disc, got it with Games With Gold or Gamepass)
   * Option to ""Buy to keep!"" if the game is from Games With Gold or Gamepass, linking to store.
* View edit Journal/Notepad (I'll use the term "" Journal"" here for consistency)
* View Control Scheme
* View Game Manual (if available)
* Buy/View Strategy Guide (if available)
* Watch on Mixer (opens Mixer)
* View Achievements
* Install/Uninstall
* Buy add-ons/DLC (opens relevant page in Store)

Unsure how best to arrange these from a usability perspective. Each one a tab with content underneath? Or a list? I chucked a list in my diagram because it was easier to draw, byt no doubt Microsoft has plenty of UXperts that can help with this.

**Game Journal**

A single Rich Text field for jotting down notes for spell potions, what you're doing in the game and other stuff. Free format, and optionally shareable.

This is something I've wanted for ages, and user u/hcgfh reminded me of it. As I mentioned earlier there are precedents for this in NeverWinter Nights, Baldur's Gate and Morrowind.

**View Control Scheme**

I always forget what the damned controls are in games. Having this easily available on tablet or phone while playing would be a boon.

**View Game Manual**

Game manuals are available on the MS site in PDF format. Games are getting a lot more complex these days, and I find them handy. This would also give publishers scope for adding value for their digital offerings as well. Heck, chuck in artbooks, novellas and little mini-encyclopedias of lore as well if you want.

**Buy/View Strategy Guide**

I don't kow how well Microsoft gets on with Prima, but they do some online strategy guides for their games, and that's what gave me the idea. They're interactive with little menus and maps and things, and pretty good for a few quid. Future Publishing release their guides on Kindle as well, and Microsoft did sell books at one point too.

An HTML format guide or eBook, or even PDF would be handy.

If Microsoft can sell them on the store, they could also form part of special offer bundles.

**View Achievements**

Does what it says on the tin: takes you to the list of your achievements in the game.

**Buy DLC**

Opens the store page for DLC for the game, or coins or other add-ons.

**Install/Uninstall**

Options to remotely install/uninstall remotely. Might be useful.

*....And breathe, I've finished...*

That's pretty much it. I just feel that the Xbox app is kind of useless for me. I genuinely don't care about clubs or the activity feed (I don't game to be social!), achievements are kind of 'meh'. I'd rather have something that 'helps me game'. The keyboard and the store are the only bits I ever use right now!

Anyway I'll stop now and leave it with you guys. And sorry for the crappy drawing!

Namaste!

xboxinsiders,fmzclv6,t1_fmjst0c,1586515397.0,"Yes, and integrate this with the xbox phone app!

I often come back to games after a long break and forget what I was doing in it, so having the ability to keep a game journal integrated with the system would be cool. Also the ability to share read-only versions with friends and online too may be handy.

There are precedents for this: games like Baldurs Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Morrowind all had in-game notepads."
xboxinsiders,fmz7pil,t1_fmgpn7o,1586509686.0,"I like to play RPGs and simulations, so anything that allows or improves mapping of chatpad buttons to game functions would be very welcome indeed.

To digress a little, I often feel that if MS had bundled the chatpad with the xbox, and assuming using it as game control buttons was possible, we could enjoy a far richer RPG/Simulation experience on Xbox. Mapping ship functions to buttons on the chatpad in Elite: Dangerous would be fantadtic (though the Frontier devs did a great job with the context menus).

At the moment though due to the fact that chatpad is very much an ""optional extra"", I doubt de s or MS are too bothered. Plus I spose games like RPGs and Simulations are a bit niche."

xboxinsiders,fmz6ab0,t1_fmimncg,1586508070.0,"Upvoting this, because a user's achievements are (arguably) personal data, and we should be able to control it and delete it.

Although I dont think there should be a charge, more just a ""Reset achievements"" button or option for each game so a user can bring up their achievements, scroll down to the game in question, and have the option to reset.

To prevent abuse by hacks, MS could potentially use two-factor authentication, eg an email to the user saying something like:

""Hi user,

We've received a request on your xbox to delete your Skyrim achievements.

If this was you, we need to be sure you really want to do this. This operation cannot be undone! Click _here_ if yes, or just ignore this email if you've changed your mind. Links are valid for 72 hours.

If you did not request this, someone else may have access to your xbox. Please contact us.

Lots of love,
