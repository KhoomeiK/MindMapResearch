raisedbynarcissists,fqaa2qx,t3_ghg27z,1589215497.0,"Hey OP. I’m 22 here. I was in the exact same position as you (still kind of am tbh). I want you to know that you aren’t alone. 

My parents emotionally abused me while growing up (I got PTSD from it). I was trained to get good grades (I would get love whenever I brought home good grades), so I became fearful of people and had abandonment issues. I even had to get hospitalized for suicidal thoughts because life came to be too much for me. I had no real joy in life until I left my house. 

If you can find any reason to keep surviving (the sunshine, a favorite plant you love to care for, a pet), you’ll find that spark in your life again. You just have to try to change your environment if you can, even if it’s temporary, like taking a walk or sitting on a front porch. you’ll be able to think clearer afterwards. 

Going to a therapist will help you sort out your baggage and help you on your way to healing. I wish you all the best things in life, OP. If you need a listening ear, I’m just a DM away!"

enneagram6,fpljvrr,t3_fgthl3,1588714022.0,"6w5 human here. I have a partner who’s a 2w3. We’re similar in the sense that we both have trust issues, but I have way more issues that he’s helping me work through. He tends to have more energy than I do and is more willing to hang out with friends at a loud bar or somewhere with a lot of people. I’m very much an introvert, so I tend to need alone time a lot more than he needs it. I also tend to have a lot of anxieties around whether I’m pleasing everyone or not (that’s probably from trauma tbh) as well as anxiety about whether I’m worthy of love or not. I tend to have way more thoughts brewing in my head than words to contribute to any given conversation. 

It sounds like maybe your wife had a partner in the past who was either abusive or cheated on her (or really hurt her in some way), so it may be hard for her to hear about your past when it didn’t involve her. I know that I, personally, need way more reassurance and my love languages to be respected a bit more if I’m feeling insecure (also highly recommend checking out the five love languages if you haven’t yet). Hope this helps! And I’m glad to see you on this subreddit trying to learn more about 6’s. I’m sure she’ll really appreciate you trying to learn more about her type :)"
EatingDisorders,fp4aexj,t3_gb2e1a,1588294905.0,"(CW: abuse)

I apologize in advance if this is a bit graphic, so I’m gonna slap a CW on this to keep everyone safe. 

If you deal with any form of emotional or physical abuse, do *NOT* tell them, and seek professional help. If you see any red flags from them, do not tell them. This is for safety reasons. If you experience any level of abuse or see red flags, make sure to not tell them because they could easily manipulate you into relapsing even more. They could also use that as a weapon against you. 

But if you live in a loving, supportive household, tell them, and maybe ask them if they can take you to seek out professional help. This will be beneficial long term, especially short term, because communication is vital to any healthy relationship. 

Either way, I’m sending you healing vibes and well wishes, friend <3"

I always thought I didn’t have an eating disorder because I didn’t fit all the criteria of anorexia. I mean, I knew eating one small meal a day was bad, but I didn’t think I had an eating disorder until I got diagnosed a little over a month ago. 

Because your eating causes you distress, it could be an eating disorder. You may have AFRID like I do, but it would be best to go to a therapist or counselor to ensure that it’s not a full-blown disorder. 

Now, this is probably a little too gross, but bear with me for a moment. I promise this has relevance. You should watch the way your body reacts to your eating patterns (basically watch your bowels). For me, if I eat anything anymore, my body gets rid of it as soon as possible (whether that’s vomiting involuntarily or diarrhea). My ED has fucked my body up pretty good, so that could also be a sign that something isn’t right.

I’d write notes about it (I have a fuck ton of notes on my phone that just kinda keeps track of my mental health). It can help you get to the source of why exactly you’re fearful of people.

I must say that this post honestly gives me hope because I have PTSD, major depression and other diagnoses. I also almost dropped out of college (I went from a high school honors student to a struggling college kid in a matter of months). I, too, graduated, but I can’t find a job in my field. I’ve been getting even more depressed about it, but this makes me feel like I’m not alone. So thank you 💙 I can’t wait to see how far you go!"
CongratsLikeImFive,f91b8u7,t3_e31hm5,1574985724.0,"Congrats! I know heroin is a bitch, but you did it! You’re so strong for being able to resist your cravings.

One of my friends texts me this Bojack Horseman everyday to help me, so I want you to keep this in mind in case you ever have a craving: “*It gets easier. Every day, it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it everyday- that’s the hard part. But it does get easier*.”

Also, if you need someone to talk to or help you through future cravings, my DM’s are open 🤗 but keep kicking ass!"

It definitely breaks my heart that so many people have dealt with the same shit, but it also makes me feel a hell of a lot less alone (I’m especially struggling rn because I still live with my parents, and I’m trying to discern whether they actually care about me or not, and it’s hard to wrap my mind around. I’m still coming to terms with the fact that they’re abusive, even if it isn’t all the time)"
raisedbynarcissists,f8qmfm5,t1_f8ql1cv,1574720047.0,"Yeah, it’s fuckin awful, especially if you do something small like word something weird or bump into someone. For me, if something minor like that happens, I’ll be anxious for the rest of the day because I’ll be scared of setting that person off. It’s fuckin horrible"
raisedbynarcissists,f8qmabj,t1_f8q97rn,1574719982.0,I’m fully convinced all narcs were either pumped out of the same mill or were all abused while growing up then ended up seeking revenge on their kids
raisedbynarcissists,f8pdckz,t1_f8ok42m,1574699657.0,"“You are allowed to take up space unapologetically.” Holy shit. That hits HARD. 

My mom would always guilt me with whatever weapons she could use, whether that was my weight or me forgetting one time to do chores. I was always called ungrateful, selfish and lazy. It’s been hard trying to not apologize for simply existing, especially to people like my boyfriend, but it’s been getting better"
