I totally get what you mean. It‚Äôs a flawless concept in a philosophy class (Kant?), but I certainly am seeing more and more flaws with it. Just because ever person is capable of making their own decisions and being rational doesn‚Äôt mean they exercise that ability. It‚Äôs still a territory that makes me feel a bit weird, making a decision for someone because you know better than they do, but I totally get the growing older perspective and can see how your personal experience in that area would be beyond my own. My line of work has me around the parties I mentioned in my earlier comment. So I see the flaw in my stance, but it‚Äôs almost like a case of Orwellian double think.

I do not think these relationships should be a profession because they are definitely temporary. In college I knew some people in who had these arrangements with some Wall Street guys though. It helped put them through school, pay rent, etc. but that‚Äôs the key to it, they can‚Äôt be relied upon, they have to be a means to an end.. with the end being some level of personal growth. I am a huge proponent of individual autonomy. The same can be applied to the modeling industry and professional sports. These things need to be viewed as an opportunity and not as a career because they aren‚Äôt.

As for your second question, I‚Äôd say yes. So long as there is no harm done I don‚Äôt take issue with it. Overlooking offending the sensibilities of certain people of course. I.e. views on what is acceptable based on ideology, religious guidance, etc. Cultural relativism can apply to this in most cases.

AskReddit,fpw5h7s,t3_gfsi0q,1588957595.0,"I was at a friends house in Kent, Ohio. Around 11:30 PM I stepped outside on his back patio for a smoke. He lived very close to the train tracks and the river that run through the town. I heard some branches snapping off in the distance, kinda deep into the woods. Not uncommon. But then that was accompanied by what I can only describe as a child screaming in protest. Like literally screaming and things like, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù or ‚ÄúStop,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go...‚Äù I was pretty shook by this. I started to pursue, but it was pitch black and the woods leading to the river area were very unfamiliar to me. I knew it was hopeless to catch up, especially after the sounds of protests and snapping branches quickly began to fade into the distance. 

I should mention at this point that a group of people were walking on the street (not where the sound was coming from and walking in the opposite direction the sounds were going) and I could hear quiet casual chatter, no reaction to what I was hearing. I should also mention that I had gone through my go-to self-test to make sure I wasn‚Äôt having an auditory hallucination because I may have taken some LSD earlier. Really easy to tell if your hallucinating when the volume of the sound your hearing doesn‚Äôt change at all when you do things that would make you hear it differently, close a window, move around, etc. the screams were coming from a very specific direction.

I can only describe what happened as some kind of echo from a past event. I landed on this conclusion because, after this jarring experience, I did some research on the area and actually found something... two kids had gone missing that same night like 30 years earlier. Their bodies were found the next day in the river, downstream from where my friend‚Äôs house was. I truly believe that I, having an altered and heightened state of perception, heard an ‚Äúecho from the past‚Äù or was ‚Äútuned in‚Äù somehow to the emotional imprint that was left there on that day decades earlier."
