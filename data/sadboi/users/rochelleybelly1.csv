Yes I wrote generation population by mistake and corrected it instantly. I'm not being narky, I just don't think you know how to have a conversation without getting offended by anyone who dares disagree with you.
Good luck with your one sided argument, I'm not going to humor this rubbish anymore"

rant,flvu37c,t1_flvtkb9,1585532137.0,"I read until the disclaimer, the reason I said if everyone were to stay home for two weeks, was because that's what the doctors are suggesting everyone with the virus do. So in my assumption, I figured two weeks would be enough for it to pass from everyone.
I didn't take into account that other people are carriers and it would take at least that long for them to potentially pass it on.
You make good points in your argument, but the way it's worded is still harder to interpretate for some people. Including myself at the beginning."

This in itself shouldn't have turned into an argument. I feel as though staying home is the safest option, that's  my personal opinion, as you have stated yours. If we both agree that staying home is a safe alternative to slowing the spread of this I don't see why you are still trying to flip it into some victim hood, you've been attacked over your veiw bullshit? Your pretentious attitude has blinded you from seeing the bigger picture here. I highly doubt anyone will agree with what you've said, because the way you have worded it does make it sound as though you'd rather people don't self isolate, until the disclaimer at the end."
rant,flvrl7w,t1_flvrc9e,1585530453.0,"Okay, so I am not doing that.
I asked a question, stated that I'd rather stay home. So now you're ""attacking a strawman"" because you've misinterpreted what i said and took it personally"
