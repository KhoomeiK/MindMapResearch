That right there is something to feel accomplished about. And for the education part.. idrk how the world works with all that stuff.. I’m barely 17 but I guess if you want to learn adding and subtracting.. multiplication and division, maybe try YouTube 🤷‍♂️ the other day I wanted to learn to square root anything in my head.. learned it in 10 minutes.. and I have no special mind 😂 but best of luck to you man.. maybe try and find something to hold onto 🤷‍♂️ for me I have been depressed for years.. and everytime I wanted to just end it I looked toward my religion (Christianity). That’s just me but maybe find something, someone, a hobby that you like and just hold onto that. Don’t give up though my man, even when you don’t expect it, god will surprise you with what you need, all you have to do is ask."

Or take a long roller and move your foot up and down on it. Step on anything that rolls lol and just massage that foot. And also IMO I think you should get a better running shoe like brooks or hokas. When it comes to shoes, don’t cut corners.. it’s not worth the pain.. I have brooks.. the most soft cooshonie (can’t spell) ones and my feel still hurt after running 7 miles.. just get the best ones for you. Especially running distance. 

Also Proud of all of you for losing weight 😁 we need more people motivated like you!"
depression,ff121vf,t3_eqs4h8,1579474424.0,"I would definitely agree with this.

For me it did get better.. took over 3 years.. but I think the “it getting better but getting worst again” is a part of the getting better.. it’s almost like there were hiccups in the road to get past. 

But I do notice for a lot of people.. don’t get better which is why I’m so thankful 🙏 I’m on medication though"

depression,fchfzyb,t1_fcha5le,1577650139.0,"Well that’s good to hear!! I’m glad you are in a better place.. see even when people think they are worth nothing look at that, you managed to go from being in a horrible place to a better place.. that gives people hope! And yeah I totally understand that.. I went to a few therapists and they sound like moms and dads just pulling shit out of their ass giving random advice.. I told one therapist I was depressed and she’s like, oh maybe we can work on your grades that might help like bitch what 😂. My grades are shit because I’m depressed.. fix my depression then I’ll fix the grades lol. And then I’d go to a psychiatrist and they will totally understand it all.. and they actually give good advice.. way better in my opinion. But that’s good you are being straight up with people.. I always found that to help for me a lot, to just open up to people and let them in, and you’re right you can’t hide it so best thing to do is be honest 🤷‍♂️ and yeah if people can’t understand how hard it is do bother trying to make them understand. They will never. Lots of people do not have empathy anymore. 

Glad to hear that things are getting better though man :)"
depression,fchdpcl,t1_fceibgc,1577649573.0,"Ofc! I’m just tryna spread happiness to people :) even if it’s just a little it’s worth my time. Yeah I used to be very quiet too.. I wasn’t necessarily shy though but when you start talking to people.. it took my like 7+ months to become comfortable talking to people and keeping the convo going. And I understand the wanting to talk to people.. I enjoy talking to people, I just was always bad at talking.. I’d end up saying the wrong thing all the time and either making it awkward.: saying something mean or embarrassing myself.. but I promise you if you keep talking to people it gets easier.. you will pick up on what they do.. and sometimes it helps to think ahead of what to say.. like if you know you are gonna have to talk to someone.. maybe in class or something. Maybe just think of topics ahead of time to talk about.. so when one convo dies.. just be like “oh yeah and have you heard about...” and just talk about multiple things. I used to try to keep the same convo going and that becomes harder and harder. 

And i definitely understand the wanting to love and be loved. For so long that is ALL I wanted and I’m barely 17. I just wanted to start a family and have kids.. but Idk how old you are.. but I did just get out of a 7 month relationship.. and I’m so happy to be single.. mostly people only see the good about being in a relationship.. all the funny and exciting times.. but at my age.. it’s so hard when all she wants is to be with you every single day 😂 and when I’d leave she’d get sad I’m like girl leave me alone it’s high school. But I’m not saying every girl is like that.. and if you want to just find love then go for it man.. i didn’t start to open up until the middle of the relationship. I was more quiet before actually.. and it’s amazing how you find love.. I just said god I’m ready for a relationship whenever you want to give me one.. no kidding 2 weeks later this chick just gives me a box of cookies.. adds me on snap and things took off haha.. so if you have patients I promise you will find what you’re looking for :) 

And I’m really sorry to hear that man :( please don’t end your life. Trust me.. even when things are going HORRIBLY.. and you think that you are the only one that it won’t get better for.. I promise you it does because that’s exactly what I thought.. I was thinking about suicide constantly every day.. I was cutting.. it was bad. But now.. I’m doing so much better.. just keep talking to people and stuff just gets better little by little. I would definitely keep talking to people though because that’s what helped me a LOT.. even when that was the LAST thing I wanted to do.. I refused to go to a therapist MULTIPLE times.. and eventually went to a few.. but I didn’t like it.. but I did go to a psychiatrist.. and those people know what they are talking about.. they know what’s REALLY going on. But if that’s not an option for you.. I’d find a good friend to talk to.. and if you don’t even have that.. you can always message me :) I leave my inbox open for everyone who needs help/advice whatever it is.. or even just someone to vent or rant to.. because I know how hard it is to not be able to do that. Best of luck to you though man :) I hope you find what you want"

depression,fcao82w,t3_egqb2z,1577573205.0,Ok I can completely relate man! I’ve been in a very similar situation.. I met this girl who actually had feelings for me.. I fell for her so hard.. I was depressed for over 2 years because I just wanted to be with her (she dumped me lol) but I was always thinking about her every day. How Id treat her so much better than the boyfriend she had who was a complete drug addict. It was awful.it eventually pushed me to an even deeper depression  and I was at the point of cutting and almost suicide. Three years later.. I’ve been texting her recently.. and we are actually friends now.. or so I thought.. I came to realize that I was fighting more for the friendship than she ever would. So I just stop texting.. I’ll text her occasionally but I’ve realized why fight for someone when I can find someone else. I guess that’s not what you want to hear though.. so my advice is.. tell her how you feel.. but if you don’t feel comfortable doing that then just keep talking to her and get closer.. hopefully this helped a little man.. but don’t give up! I never thought I’d find anyone else than that girl.. and I found someone better.. it’s amazing what happens if you have patients and wait on gods timing :) beat of luck to you man! Hope you find what you’re looking for!
depression,fcah0xw,t1_fcadfhk,1577569095.0,Wow well spoken! You go! I like what you said about being straight forward with people. That’s pretty cool 😎
depression,fcagim7,t1_fcabdqw,1577568832.0,"Dang that’s hard. Idk what’s been going in your life but it sounds like it’s been pretty hard.. now I’m only 16 so I don’t even remember what happened in the past decade haha.. but don’t focus on the past.. look toward the future.. not on what you thing you messed up on.. focus on what you can achieve in the future.. and start little by little.. maybe get a job (if you don’t have one) start to work toward the things you want.. it’s not gonna be easy but if you just work little by little it will get better I promise :). And maybe if you get a job, you might meet someone, then you have someone to talk to and hang out with. Best of luck to you though! I hope the new decade treats you well! If you need someone to rant/talk to my inbox is open.. if you are ever feeling lonely :)"
depression,fcafvxk,t1_fcaatht,1577568524.0,"Damn. Sounds like life’s not doing ya so well right now man 😕. I know it’s hard to make friends sometimes.. I’ve been trying so hard rn.. I’ve been messaging like 6 people and I’m realizing like, why, they never message me first.. but I do have one friend who’s always been there for me so I got that. But I’d you don’t have that then I’d suggest to find a hobby you like.. and find someone who enjoys doing the same thing with you :) I know that’s easier said than done but that’s my advice :). 

I can’t exactly help with the job situation.. I’m poor too and living with my parents.. because I’m nearly 17 😂😂. So I’m in a different situation lol.. but maybe go find a simple job.. idk what you’re looking for but maybe go work at a fast food place idk.. I’ve never even been to an interview haha. Hopefully that’s decent advice 🤷‍♂️.

Welp.. I’m 16 and I’m not a virgin.. kinda messed but I promise you if I did it you can 😂 bro I thought the sam thing a year ago.. like I’m never gonna get a girl.. next things next.. well.. you know haha. 

But don’t give up! I know things are hard right now.. gods throwing a lot of challenges but you just gotta keep fighting.. things do get better even when you don’t think so.. I once thought, nope, I’m different, things don’t get better for me, turns out they did though.. but not in a day.. or a week.. or even a month.. it does take time.. but work everything one by one.. maybe start with getting a job.. work on social skills there.. who know you maybe find a chick. Slowly work up enough money to move out. Idk bro but don’t give up! If you need to talk just message me :) my inbox is always open to those who need help"
depression,fcaeuh2,t1_fca985e,1577568021.0,Aww I’m glad that I can help :) even if it’s just a little. Stay strong! Things get better I promise! I don’t remember if I said this but if you need someone else to talk to You can always message me. I leave my inbox open for everyone :)
depression,fcaehxt,t1_fc9r721,1577567861.0,"Ok I can totally relate man!! I get it.. people suck sometimes. Or maybe all the time. You try to put forth all your effort in being friends with someone and caring for them in the worst of times, you go out of your way even. And all they give you in return is the cold shoulder. It sucks man I totally get it. I’m sorry that those people are being that way though :( and maybe that person who said that at work said it.. and realized after that it probably sounded a bit rude, I’m guilty of doing that. I’m sure they didn’t have bad intentions, or maybe they are just a piece of shit who’s grumpy idk man. But either way don’t let those little things get to you :) I know that’s easier said than done but what I’ve always though is that there at 80,300 seconds (ish) I’m a day.. why let those 30 seconds ruin the rest of it. But that’s me I guess.. I found that to help me in some times like those. Sorry if this is tmi but I’m currently on medication for depression.. it’s supposed to make me not get random moments of being super happy.. and the next wanting to legit kill myself. When I wasn’t on it though it was really hard for those little things to not get to me. 
I can understand that part about girls to man haha.. I’ve have so many girls call me cute, and then once one starts to like me I’m like eh do yourself a favor and look away huh.. but I think if you gave yourself a shot you’d be surprised.. I actually gave a relationship a shot once.. and things actually got better.. it helps to have someone close to lean on. I’m not current with that girl though.. I broke up with her because she was way to much for me to handle with all this other stuff haha but you never know 🤷‍♂️ don’t give up though man.. I know it’s hard to think why not end it.. 1 person out of 7 Billion isn’t going to make a difference.. but if you look at it you might be helping other people.. maybe someone’s looking up to you rn and you don’t even know it. There will be people that need you though man.. just as much as there will be people that you look toward for help :) stay strong man 💪 keep hanging on. If you ever need to talk to someone you can always message me :)"

I know that’s easier said than done.. just find something you like to do.. find someone who likes doing it too.. make an effort to talk to them and hang out more and more and eventually you can get to the point of having someone to talk to..

I know that’s hard to do though if you feel like shit.

And if your family is sick of it then I’m really sorry to hear that, that’s hard.

depression,fc8i2ga,t1_fc6ycxw,1577535370.0,But we’ve achieved something that animals haven’t.. survival.. we have everything they don’t lol.. we don’t have to work for food.. well.. besides a job.. that gives you money.. which you can spend on whatever your heart desires. So I don’t think that we still live in misery.. I mean unless you are stranded on an island and have to survive then I guess you can relate to an animal.
depression,fc8hv2o,t3_egoo0y,1577535236.0,"Well here is my advice. I just got out of a relationship.. I couldn’t be happier lol. Relationships are a lot of work.. but that’s just me.. it’s hard having to make the other happy all the time.. my gf depended on me SO much. But that’s different I guess.. but I still believe there is someone for everyone.. because I was in your shoes once.. and you just have to be patient.. idk if you’re religious.. but I just accepted being single before that relationship.. and said “god whenever you’re ready, I am” (for a relationship [obviously lol]) and within a couple weeks I had one lmao.. point is.. being a Christian I believe god has a timing for everyone.. you just have to be patient and ready for it.. enjoy the other things in life and don’t get stuck on “I want this or that” because you will get it.. when god gives it to you.. who knows.. maybe he hasn’t given you one in that moment because someone else needs you.. I ended up leaving my gf because I didn’t have time for her and my best friend.. and I chose him over her lol. Because our friendship was more important that a high school relationship. But idk if you’re in high school. 

Moral is.. be patient because you’ll get what you want eventually.. there are 7 billion people on this planet.. and you don’t think you’ll find at least ONE person you would want to spend the rest of your life with haha.. nah bro.. you will that’s a promise.. because have you ever seen someone that’s 90 and is like “welp, 90 years later and I still can’t find anyone to love me” lmao just doesn’t really happen. Someone will come around when you LEAST expect it.. no shit the reason I met that girl was because on my birthday she gave me a box of cookies.. NEVER EVEN TALKED TO HER.. next things next we’re dating hahaha"
depression,fc8h13s,t1_fc8fey0,1577534724.0,Well if you don’t want to talk to someone that’s ok too.. just find something that makes you happy.. whether it be exercise/ sports.. music (not sad music.. even if you want to listen to that.. it doesn’t help lol) .. anything at all.. just find what makes you happy and hold onto that.. for me it’s music.. and it sucks when parents take that shit away.. makes life hard. But whatever makes you happy.. find it.. hold onto it.. cherish it.
depression,fc8gmxv,t3_egomcg,1577534483.0,"Please do not kill yourself. Here is why. I have been there too where I thought why not I have nothing to lose.. this world would be better without me. I’ve cut more times than I can count, 3 years of depression later.. I’m finally clearing up and I can’t believe it. SHIT GETS BETTER I PROMISE YOU. I was at a point where I thought no.. shit doesn’t get better.. I’m different this world just hates me.. god hates me.. I’m meant to be sad. And I’m not gonna give you some bull shit saying it gets better in one day.. not even in a week.. maybe not even a month.. but I promise you things will eventually slowly get better.. just be there for each other ok.. because imagine the life you guys will have together with that friendship.. you will both have made it through the hardest time in your life. Just cherish the little moments that make you happy and hold on TIGHT to those.. look forward to those.. 

You friends should do something fun together.. even if you don’t want to.. drag yourself off that bed lol go exercise (that always makes me happier) go shopping.. do ANYTHING that you like to do.. if you don’t have a hobby.. find one.. there is endless things to do.. 

The things that helped me the most were talking to people (not therapists, those don’t help, hardly psychiatrists do either) I talked to some people that were sorta close friends but not so much anymore (that’s another story) but the more you talk about it.. and the more you bond about it.. the more you have someone with you that is going through the same stuff, same emotions, it better it is going to get :). 

Also if you ever want someone else to talk I’m always here :) I will talk to anyone if it means helping them through shit.. I respond pretty fast too so if y’all ever need someone to talk to in an emergency I’m always here :)"

It does I promise.. what got me through it is taking to people.. even if they aren’t your closest friends.. it’s like a bucket.. You just keep filling it with this poison and depression.. and eventually it’s gonna full to the top.. but you gotta learn to let people empty it. 

I hope this is good advice, it helped me a lot. So hopefully it will help you."
depression,fc8ee6a,t3_egj2vr,1577533042.0,I’m sorry to hear that. I don’t have a family but I know how hard it can be with people. I guess I’m only in high school but people can be very harsh sometimes.. when all you want to do is have someone care for you that’s the only thing you can’t get.. that’s why I’m here . Hope you can figure stuff out though man.. also tell her to put herself in your shoes.. if she was hurting and you told her to suck it up how would she feel. Not good huh. Maybe that will open her eyes a little. I’m not one to give up on people either.

I can’t exactly relate to you but why I can say is that I don’t think anyone is ugly. God has made everyone to be themselves, not someone to else, but we are all unique from each other.. and not everyone has the same type of taste in the opposite gender.. you can ask your friend who the hottest person is and they might give you someone you thought was ugly. That being said.. I don’t think anyone is ugly.. I think everyone looks different from each other and being difference scares people which is why they judge you. But fuck them, they can eat a dick, just be true to you and don’t change yourself for some losers.. find a group of people who treat you right and stick by them :) because they are your true friends. 

Side note: not everyone is going to like the same thing.. I saw a story once that I found really inspiring. Long story short this old man sat his son on a donkey.. people judged the kid for making the old man walk.. so the old man got on and they walked by another group of people who judged them saying why would you make the kid walk you old man.. so finally they both got off and carried the donkey into town on their shoulders and everyone laughed at them.

depression,fbyx6pw,t3_eczhm3,1577228772.0,"Well its entirely your decision but i would say that you should go to see your friend.. if she almost ended her life, she will really need someone to care for her because if you say she doesn't have anyone besides a few friends.. she would really be happy to see you. Even though your family might ostracize you, which would not be fun at all.. i think its awful that they would even say those things; do you have any NORMAL friends.. like i'm sorry that my friend thinks her life is so bad she decided that she should END it, have some empathy. I don't know how old you are if you can drive but what i would do is ditch them and go see her.. if my family said that i'd just leave and wouldn't care if i got in any trouble but thats just me.. i've always been the least favorite so i just don't care anymore lol. But i am very sorry about your friend, she will be in my prayers 🙏 i hope everything is well."
