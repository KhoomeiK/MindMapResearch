movies,fhacl1r,t3_f1x6k5,1581404592.0,"Just went and watched this movie with My Sis and two Nieces this evening. Granted it was a Monday night, however, the theater was just Us which was bittersweet. (Who doesn't love a theater all to themselves) Still, We all loved this movie and I think it knocked it out of the park for it's Genre. Full of Vibrant Visuals, Boss fight Scenes, and Lots of Laughs all backed with a delightful mix of Classic Remakes and Current Music made this Flick more than just for Chicks.

I encourage all that are considering seeing the movie to go out and enjoy a night at your local theater. I have been excited to check it out and it was better than I even expected! Hopeful to see some of these New to the Big Screen Characters again."
