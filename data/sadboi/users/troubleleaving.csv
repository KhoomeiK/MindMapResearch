DotA2,fpngb8b,t1_fpnfw1j,1588761906.0,"> OP has been part of the toxic community by abandoning games because of a bad internet, and that's on him.

Yes, I'm sure OP is the only person who has ever claimed their behaviour score is only low because of bad internet. Surely it couldn't be because they were toxic players who deserved their poor score. Wake up.

OP himself has stated that he has multiple gameplay summaries where he averages 4 gameplay reports. 

Do you even know how hard it is to get reported 4 times in 15 games at this behaviour score level? There are so many greifers, and so few reports, that you had to be seriously be pissing a lot of people off to get that many.

I don't really care if you can't stand the tone of the thread, or about your personal opinions about the dota community. This is only a discussion of objective reality; one that OP (and you apparently) needs to face. 

People like you who make excuses for low behaviour score players who clearly can't realize that they themselves are the problem only exacerbate the issue by prolonging their delusion."

DotA2,fpnd3hm,t1_fpncljk,1588758653.0,"You don't have to believe me, and I don't care if you do. At the end of the day, youre a 3k behaviour score player who's going to keep making excuses for themselves instead of reflecting, and getting upset at the people who tell you to truth of the matter.

>Just look at this thread. 

Ah yes, just look at this thread that got down-voted into oblivion because anyone can see how delusional the premise is.

> You're obviously an extreme antagonistic person who spends his days seething at his computer. You're obviously very angry.

And here come the projections. It's funny because you can't stop insulting me; you're obviously the angry one here. Hopefully you get the help you need to project less and introspect more! :)"
DotA2,fpnc6y7,t1_fpnbt45,1588757717.0,"You can keep making whatever excuses you want for yourself, but your behaviour score is never going to improve until you stop.

>You really sound like a mean-spirited person, you're probably not very fun to play with.

Lol I wasted my time writing honest advice to you as someone who has been through the trench and improved their behaviour score back to 10K, and all you can say is that I'm trying to troll you and to insult me. You claim that you're an old man but it looks like you still need to grow up.

Telling me that I'm probably not very fun to play with when you're literally <3000 behavior score is some insanely laughable irony. 

I have no doubts you will remain stuck in the trench forever where you be long, until you fix your delusional attitude (if you can ever even gain that clarity), and that's all I have to say about this. Goodbye."
DotA2,fpn4fib,t1_fpjii3a,1588749897.0,">Again, being 100% honest here - it really honestly seems like you're just here to be a troll and not to have any meaningful discussion. You're the only one in this thread being so antagonistic.

Then you are completely delusional, further evidencing the disconnect between your evaluation of your behaviour, and the objective reality of it."
DotA2,fpjhknh,t1_fpjfy8o,1588668765.0,"> Dude by everything right I just mean zero toxic behaviour.

Refusing to pick your hero in the drafting stage to make a point of the fact that you deserve last pick as a mid hero IS toxic behaviour, and that's just one example.

The fact that you can't understand or acknowledge this just shows how misguided you are.

Good luck rehabilitating yourself."
DotA2,fpjf6xj,t1_fpjes2x,1588666275.0,">I'm mid so I should get last pick

>I'm doing everything right

These comments are reflective of ego. 

Even if you feel like you're doing everything right, you likely aren't.

For example, if your team is willing to lose all their money and random, you should just pick your hero. 

When you are that low in behaviour score, winning the game is a secondary objective to getting higher behaviour score. Because if you don't, you will just suffer and lose in the long run because of terrible teammates. 

You have to put yourself in the shoes of your allies --who are also very low behaviour score players and irrational actors. Do not give them any reason to report you or scapegoat you.

In your one example, starting off the game having everyone lose gold and randoming your hero is absolutely not an example of ""doing everything right."" You are technically correct that you should be give last pick, but since they refuse you need to be the bigger person and just pick. 

The reason your behaviour score is still low is because you are thinking about yourself, and not the team. You need to consider what the optimal play is for the TEAM, even if your teammates are cancerous assholes. 

I know this because I've been at the very lowest behaviour scores possible, and I have done significant self reflection and understanding to realize how to raise my score. I never thought I was doing anything wrong before but ultimiately, I realized I still had an ego that was getting me reported, and I see that in your comment/post as well.

4 reports in the trench is undeniably a high amount. You know this yourself because I guarantee you yourself are frequently out of reports to give, as all people in that bracket are."
DotA2,fpjbwnx,t3_gdrw06,1588662989.0,"People at low behaviour score have very few reports, like 1 a week.

So if you are getting 4 reports, you will not be gaining any score. It's actually a lot due to the lack of reports available at bad scores. You need to be honest with yourself, which I doubt you are."

DotA2,fp1euen,t3_ganyoe,1588233158.0,"The problem with people engaging and telling them to shut up or knock it off is that just adds fuel to the fire.

People lose focus on the game and it becomes, ""you're an incel, stop being weird"" --> ""stop white knighting"" etc and people just get distracted with arguing.

And It's not just girls who get harassed in dota. Yes its a kind of harassment that's only aimed at girls, but people of all walks of life get harassed in dota for the simplest and most mundane shit. 

Just do what everyone else does in response to any flaming, and mute them, ignore them, and play the game."
