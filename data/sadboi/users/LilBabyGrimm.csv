motorcycle,fn1dk7j,t1_fn1cggx,1586559793.0,Thank you that's good advice and makes sense. We've been together over a year now and live together. It's definitely too late to not get attached. That's why I'm so scared that something will happen. I just know it will and he seems to think he can avoid it by not riding recklessly (lol he's not the only one on the road and even if he was there's still other factors like his old bike malfunctioning or something on the road he doesn't see) but I know better and if I lost him I'd go down a very dark road. I already am 90% sure what would happen. It's not fair. And he just gets mad any time I bring up the subject. But it's crossing the line if I tell him I want to do something dangerous and he can fuck off. I don't get it how he thinks lol. Its ridiculous honestly. Sorry for my rant....😕

motorcycles,fmxn42e,t1_fmxmy02,1586468095.0,Yup. I just wish he'd understand and accept this but I guess when you're in that stage where something is cool no one can tell you different.

motorcycle,fmxm6lo,t1_fmx9iwa,1586467595.0,Yeah that's true. Im definitely guilty of being a rebel and not giving a fuck about dying. Maybe it's karma for what ive put my loved ones though. It's a lot different when it's someone you love as opposed to yourself. 😞

But it's worth it not to be homeless and suicidal and getting sick all the time and spending hours upon hours trying to hit a vein. Doing terrible things to get a fix. Yes the high is the most amazing thing ive ever felt but, everything that comes with it is hell. It's so unfortunate that you can't use these drugs like you can use weed or alcohol but that's the way it is. Even if I relapse every now and then and recover quickly it's better than being in full blown addiction and no place to call home and malnourished and dirty and hungry."
