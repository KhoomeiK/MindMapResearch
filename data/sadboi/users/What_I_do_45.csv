It may be a minority of people that get paid $100,00 or more (in the U.S.), but the number is still like 20% which is a pretty big number.

In a lot of ways I've painted my life in a corner, but not a very good one, and to get out, well, I'd have to make a lot more of my days than I already do, which is basically an uphill battle where I don't really know what is the smartest way to go about how to reach a stable, self-earned life. There just aren't any easy answers. I don't know what risks are worth taking. I do know that my situation could always get worse if I mess up, and the worse things get economically, for anyone in general, the harder it is to actually get back to a place of stability. In a lot of ways, stability seems like a privelage, one that only a certain amount of good fortune can bring. I want to believe everything is in my power to control. To legitimately have any kind of real faith in anything seems more like embracing a pipe dream more than it does embracing a new way of approaching life, yet at the same time, I have to avoid using this lack of faith to justify not trying anything at all. Still, like I said, if I make certain mistakes; good faith-but-trying-my-hardest-yet-still-shooting-myself-in-the-foot mistakes, I'll just have even more demoralizing problems to have to try to solve."

SuicideWatch,fq7rpnc,t1_fq7l0x8,1589150846.0,"I had one session of therapy and I was basically told to just grow up already and to also not worry about anyone but myself. I just want to die.

Obviously I am depressed but I'm not really interested in trying to ""fight the depression"". I honestly just am not willing or able to cope with the demands of life and I'm probably just going to sit around and waste my time until my life situation gets a lot worse so that maybe I will have the will to kill myself afterwards. 

Nice try though. I don't even know why I post this shit anymore. Just shouting into the void.  But it's not like I'm going to come to some revelation about what specific mental afflictions are holding me back. Because I have spent years and years self reflecting and ruminating and researching and the truth is at this point in my life I have more clarity about who I am and what exactly is afflicting me than I ever have. 

The problem is I just don't give a shit anymore and I'll probably resent the fact that I can't just get high and do absolutely nothing anymore for the rest of my waking days. I've written an entire book in Reddit posts about how I feel pretty much every day so I'm not going to really explain myself further here (I don't mean the tone of that to sound mean spirited). I just don't have the will to work towards anything. Being productive at all is basically hell on Earth and no amount of self rewarding is ever going to make up for that. 

I just wish I had a gun to put myself out of my misery quickly. Too Cowardly to kill myself but I sure as shit am not going to spend my waking hours getting things done, socializing/having relationships with others, practicing skills, learning new things, being physically active, or anything that has anything to do at all with achieving any kind of goal. 

To be frank, one of the biggest reasons I will never talk to another professional about this shit is that I very, very deeply do not want to. I do not want to experience absolutely any of the emotions associated with that, nor do I want to spend any of the time and money associated with any of that anyways.

I don't need outside help anyways. I already know what I need to do. I don't have the will or the energy or the inclination to do any of it. That's on me and I don't really care. I hate myself enough already and I'm just not interested in fighting for my own happiness anymore or for a better life. I just want to get high. I have not smoked weed for a week. No that's not a pride point. It is a pain point. A willing indulgence in misery, a decision made out of desperation based on an ironic concern for my future that I lost interest in by the day as I cope with having to do anything at all in life that could be called a responsible decision or an ""investment in my future."" Each little baby step at a time is another step further into the indulgence of hell that is what life demands of every person. I have no excuses. I'm not looking for them nor am I trying to find a reason to forgive myself for my past failures, mostly because whether or not I forgive myself at all is just a silly moot point. I don't want to move forward. I just want it all to be over and at this point I'm really just waiting for my time to come, whether it is brought about by my own hand or otherwise, and I'm just going to have to accept the consequences of my inaction in the meantime."

Either way, it's difficult to embrace those demands. My default is having time to myself and switching that to the complete opposite is hard to cope with I guess."

I already am to whoever I told and frankly it has made my life worse having this shit permeate any of those relationships. I know that there are people that will feel my loss intimately, trust me. But it's not about them, it's about me having to do literally *all of the shit I laid out* every single goddamn day, still not being able to responsibly afford or partake in the *only* pleasures I have, which are basically smoking weed and fulfilling my sexual fantasies. I get to have none of those and not be destitute, or I get to have those and be destitute. You don't seem to understand the sheer gravity of having to do all of thing things I stated. Well guess what, all of those people who would be intimately effected by my death, I don't get any pleasure out of my relationships with them! And I never will because I am not comfortable with love or positive connection with other people and I probably never will be! And in a lot of ways *I am not capable of reaping joy from interpersonal relationships with others*. I should have to suffer the *literally never ending work* of life to make sure they don't feel emotional pain? What about me?

To your quest, no, I would not judge anyone for going through this shit. The difference between myself and a lot of people though, is that it is *every little, tiny thing we have to do in modern life* that makes existence so torturous. I cannot be asked to keep track of *all of this fucking information*. So goddamn much of it. Login, password, login password, login password, login password, ad nauseum. How much money did I make this year to *the last fucking penny?* Gotta know for tax time. Oh, my social skills are trash and I have zero confidence in my ability to successfully navigate social relationships, *but fuck that right? I can always practice and learn!""* But do you understand how torturous that is for me? Every conversation leading me back into the breach and feeling *fucking shittier* after almost every one. Gotta coordinate fucking *everything* and keep track of every fucking appointment. In reality, I don't have the brainpower to do these things. And the cost...the cost of living ... somehow it feels like that part is being lost on you...although it seems like you should also be intimately familiar with those kind of concerns judging from your story...but maybe you don't realize that hard work doesn't gaurantee you a spot in the middle class anymore. Let's think about social norms. I become destitute, and basically everyone fucking treats me like a bum, useless, burden...I am not bling to what a future of destitution holds. Begging for a job and promising you are a hard worker...that shit *should work* but it just fucking doesn't. Nobody wants to give anyone a chance it seems."
SuicideWatch,fpm8hfu,t1_fpm7hv3,1588727717.0,"I don't really believe it would help though. I don't have anyone to rely on except myself, and I don't want to involve other people. I just want to keep my distance from others because I'm not comfortable at all around them. I just feel mortified every time I think of when I opened up to someone. It was always a big mistake. I don't want to spend what little money I have on it, or borrow it from someone else or go into debt. Really talking to people about it is not an option. That would be torture. An admission of weaknesses. Just not an option. I don't understand how it would even help. I don't want to be that open with someone. I don't want their pity. I hated what few minutes I had at a hospital. Just fucking mortifying that anyone would see me in a psych ward and therapy makes me feel pathetic in the eyes of everyone there too. I don't want to be tested and studied like an animal. I don't want to aquiesce to whatever the doctors think is best. I don't have the energy to help myself. Professional help is just the blind leading the blind. I already was forcibly checked into a psych ward once and somehow escaped being committed, thank fucking god. It was the most absolutely mortifying experience of my entire life. At least one of them. Just the way the doctor looked at me, prodding me to answer questions about what I do every day...it was hell. I don't want to take their experimental medications. I don't want to be given tools on how to deal with the things I have to do every day. I just don't want to do those things in general. I just don't have the will to live. Life is too hard. I'll never be happy to have to do all of this crap. There is no goal to make the suffering to be worth it, there can never be, because I just don't want anything anymore. My social anxiety is too powerful. I do not want to be a part of a community or society, but I don't have the energy to really any way at all to live on my own without being stuck outside so I just don't understand what light there really is at the end if the tunnel beyond death.

The truth is, I'm fucked up. I'm not willing to take drugs. I resent that I would ever have to. ADHD drugs, not worth it. Antidepressants, very poorly understood. And just the fucking cost of it all. I don't have a fucking income and I just can't finish a job application or deal with the fucking government bureaucracy anymore because having to keep all this bullshit paperwork around, taking another psychometric fucking test, having to talk to anyone at all in order to still have references to put on a job application, having to fucking travel to and fro to and fro to and fro, having to make sure I still have enough to eat and keep my phone on, having to keep track of fucking taxes, having to just do fucking anything because of ""social norms,"" having to deal with people every day, doing household chores every day in the *midst* of *every single one of those thing*; it is all hell. I'm sick of having to rip myself off the wall to go back into the fucking breach. Every productive task in life is just another slow, painful journey into the breach. I don't understand how anyone can feel happy to have to do all of this not actually knowing if it will ever be worth it. I don't understand how anyone can just deal with life without allowing themselves to just get *fucking high as shit* because there is just no joy to be had among all of these things; just torture. 

Regular people look at someone like me as having an attitude problem or just as someone who is crazy. I feel so goddamn lethargic. The only time I actually feel good is when I am *escaping life*, not participating in it! And trying to put any of my brain power into participating in it...it's not even there. It's just not there. Structure, discipline, interpersonal relationships, desperately trying to prove that I have fucking value *just* so I can one day support a basic lifestyle for myself, something that appears to be so far out of reach...I think the answer is that I just need to believe, but I don't. I don't believe that my ""depression is a liar"" because every thought I have that has lead me down this road is completely rational. I just can't bear to play the game of Life, and it is certainly just a game. *I'm to petulant to play the game.* I resent the way everything is ""just the way it is."" I can't accept it. And I'm fucking scared because I am on the fast track to complete destitution. I cannot suffer for months or years before I am able to fully realize some kind of life I would actually enjoy. But I would rather hang peacefully than deal with a life of little means, or alternatively, I would rather hang instead of dealing with a life devoid of the *only* pleasures I give a shit about just to hopefully one day attain those pleasures, but more than likely end up dying before I ever reach those goals. 

And you know what? If I go to a professional and lay out all this shit to them, you know what that makes me in their eyes? Crazy. I'm not f*cking crazy. I am being honest and realistic with myself.

AskReddit,fpdbaxs,t3_gcna0k,1588523605.0,"I didn't really fall into the camp of thinking I deserved sex and indulging in white-knightery.  Around 9th-10th grade depression hit me pretty hard, because the effects of my social anxiety were noticably causing me to be alienated and ostracized, by both myself and others. The thing is, when I was younger, I wasn't ""self aware"" of these emotional problems. So there was never any push or even inclination for me to ""see a professional"" or talk to a counselor about my problems. To me, back then, that's just kind of how things were. My self esteem was trash and I suffered from an inferiority complex. 

Mix all of those things together, and you get a person who is very socially out of touch, socially uncomfortable (around everyone, to an extent), and not inclined in the least to interact with people that weren't already a friend I felt comfortable around. Because of my depression and anxiety, I basically failed at interpersonal relationships. I was not capable of being charismatic or excited or anything that makes someone magnetic to others. You know that vibe you get when someone types out :) :) :) :D :D :D, ? Yeah, I just could not be that person for others in real life. Not even in a subtle way.  In other words, my social skills were trash. 

Now I was also very sensitive to perceived slights or rejection. Mix that with entering the social environment of high school, and I really did not like my peers. I hated the fact that they , for reasons I just couldn't see at the time, either didn't like me, respect, or give a shit at all about me. I became the classic guy who thinks everyone is essentially a fake asshole, and it *works for them so we'll*. This started me on a path of feeling very bitter towards the world. And I was not self aware enough at the time, for many years, to know that my emotional inner workings were actually a problem. To me, I felt normal, and I was looking living in a world that worked in a way that was totally incongruent with who I was a person. Again, this led to feelings of both bitterness and inadequacy. You might ask, why didn't I try to improve myself? 

Well, I figured at the very least, I would offer myself respect. I was bitter that I couldn't get close to people, but that wasn't going to stop me from believing how I was was ""right"" or at the very least ""ok"". If people still didn't like me for being me, fuck em. I basically lived my life on autopilot, played videogames all day, and started a self destructive weed habit junior year that has negatively impacted my life to this day.

And because of all this, for a long time, I was involuntarily celebate. Now that I'm older, I've had a lot of time to reflect. I'm self aware of my issues. Now I'm voluntarily celibate. Just another perspective I guess. I will admit, although I didn't feel entitled to anything from a woman, I definitely felt a comfort in trashing the way women seem to work among my fellow incels. They make a lot of great points about society and how things just are in this work if you can look past the hate and irrationality of many of them. But to be fair, all they are really doing is complaining. I don't know."
