depression,ewkhbm9,t3_cocukx,1565484421.0,"This. Actions speak louder than words and we've all done it. We long for human connection even if that connection like you said is just sitting there next to that person.

I do admit that I didn't really understand depression until I went through it and ironically my depression happened because of my ex's depression. I won't get into it but basically she blamed everything on her depression for 6 months and every time I thought everything was going okay, apparently it wasn't. Especially if I couldn't be there or do something for her at the moment. I tried to help and understand but it doesn't make the issues in a relationship go away. 

You have to at least try and help yourself, sometimes you can't but never stop trying things. Also sadly enough, no one will care about your depression as much as you do. 

If I had that second chance, I'd handle it so much better now. All those *what-ifs* in my head. But a relationship takes two."

Then there's the really bad ones where she's so close and yet so far away from me and nothing I do will make her come back or she's with someone else.

depression,evzvsmv,t1_evz6vf7,1564968617.0,"Yeah, because the typical response is to pawn off your kids to someone else. Don't you think that she would've done that already if she didn't care who raised her kids? She obviously doesn't want  to do that. She wants them to be raised the way she wants. People are growing up today in such a connected society yet losing the meaningful connections, the understanding of each other, the lack of response and remorse for those that are closest to them. So close to each other and yet so far away. 

Yes, she can try to become more understanding of his situation and make it better but so can he. If the people you're suppose to care most for in the world aren't feeling cared for, then don't you think that there should be some compromise? 

You aren't everyone and your way isn't always the ""right way"". If anything you've learned in your life by now is you should know that there's really no black and white."

That relationship will be at a lost. I said that there needs to be an understanding of each other. You both are going through your own madness and only focusing on your own madness, not understanding each other. 

Talk with him in a way that lets him know you still love him, the kids, and want to make this family work. Talk to him about your needs and why you're feeling this way. Then let him talk as well. Do not interupt each other, do not make snude comments if you don't agree but try and understand. It's not always going to be and almost should never be I'm right you're wrong. It's compromise. It's working through it together. Let him know that he's not useless, that he works hard and that you work hard but with this little extra effort from each other, maybe you guys will be happier. Talk to him about his depression and check up on him. Don't even need to give him advice, maybe just being there for him will help.

If a stay at home parent is working from the moment their kids get up (let's say 12 hours/day 8am - 8pm), that is 84 hours per week. There's not a lot of down time for themselves, is there? Yeah it may be doing tasks that are mostly mundane, but doesn't change the fact that they are constantly taking care of tiny humans who have no way to do it themselves. Why do you think working at a nursing home is a full time job? Why do you think they have round the clock for them?

We are humans and need interaction with like minded beings. If the only person who can provide that to her isn't, they will both break. There's a lack of understanding of each other. It's not a matter of what is just logical when it comes to human interaction (especially between SO, family, or friends), it's a matter of compromise, sacrifice, and understanding each other.  It's not well I do this, so you do that. You do things (although very hard with depression) for those you care for."

From sunrise to sunset she is dealing with fragile as fuck beings that have no appreciation, no consideration, and nothing to offer for many years to come. 

She also has no one around for to help, to share the experiences, to give her a bonus for working hard because of the fact that the kids can barely comprehend what's going on around them. 


The business is a way to give her a little more meaning. Yes, I understand that doing that will require more time than an average job. That there are more risks to it than an average job. 

No one is ever prepared for kids, no one really knows the amount of blood, sweat, and tears that goes into it. Parents are always making sacrifices (the good ones) but no one is perfect. It's not all sunshine and rainbows and from what I know and hear, most of the time it's a lot of work. There has to be sacrifice from both parties and your ""happiness/purpose"" is delayed.

You have to constantly deal with mind numbing tasks that do no excite you in any way, shape or form. Watch Disney movies, play with Legos/dolls constantly? That can get very boring, very quickly. Yet you're saying doing the same job 5 days a week? They do it 7 days a week, constantly. Academia? Really? They are in their first few years learning just to speak, gesture, maybe a sentence, etc. Not to mention that kids have no appreciation for anything you do right now (they might in the future but definitely not now). 

You will suggest to her go out with her friends who have kids or go make some? How the hell can she do that when the husband won't ever look after the kids (also why would you want him to if he won't even pay attention to them and is depressed? Accident waiting to happen) She has to bring them because she can't leave them with him. Then when she brings the kids out with her, she has to worry about everything the kids are doing. It's a constant stress that they are dealing with. 

Yes, depression is a mental illness that is very severe and very consuming. Depression tore my life apart and still is but doesn't mean that you can't (even if you your mind can't comprehend it or feel it) force yourself to give smallest of appreciations. If he can get the strength to go to work and do that for however long, he can say/ do some things once in a blue moon for those who are the most important people in his life. 

Both parties need to work on their relationship and communication skills. Helping each other a little more with actions and comments can go a long way. 

I'd also like to add maybe now she can enroll them into pre-school or day care but some parents want to raise their own children in the beginning stages of life."

Because I wanted to make this work. Because she challenged me to reflect on myself and become a better person. Because even though we fought about the stupid things, it's not the thing that matters but what it represents to me. I guess it was all too late though. I lost myself in the process and she stayed the same and pulled me away with her. I lost it and did things I thought I'd never do. It hurts so much and all I do is think *what if*?

This is called self-love/self-care and makes you realize what you stand for and what you will tolerate. The thing is that the extremes are used too often on this when people learn of it. We gotta control and be calm. 

What we suffer from is called functional depression and it's a hell in itself. 

Also dude, the thoughts in my head are all ""what-ifs"" lol. The important part is that you reflected. You did the work to grow. It doesn't take away the pain and sadly, nothing can really do that.

I would be there for her whenever I could. If she was feeling sad, alone, having problems with people, work, needed help, etc. I was always there.

Not once did she ever do this for me and every time something bothered me and I told her that I needed my space or wanted to talk about these things, she'd just say ""that I'm going through waves of depression"" as if that makes it all go away.

She also didn't see any counseling or do anything to help it. Well after a half-year of this of trying to help and me not handling it as well as I could now (went through my own depression and still dealing with it), I had to end it. 

The thing about depression is that no one will care about your depression as much as you do. It's as harsh as it sounds but it's the truth. I can only do so much to help. You have to help yourself (in a positive way) because you know your depression the best.

Towards the end of my relationship with my ex we were on the rocks. I deeply cared for this girl and I was about to graduate and was looking for jobs. I lived in Minnesota and got an amazing job offer all the way in Texas. I asked her what she thinks? She said I think you should go to Texas. I took this as we care enough for each other and even though things aren't great right now, I wanted to do this for a bit to create a better future for the two of us. Towards the last few weeks before I left, she seemed to be distanting herself and I asked her to be considerate because I'm still trying to find stuff near here so that I can stay with you, even if it's not as great but close-ish to this job offer. She didn't seem to care about anything going on in my life. I kept getting angry and told her that at least act like you care even if you don't care about things going on in my life because I'm doing all this for her. She said she's been going through waves of depression and never told me about these times. She said she's had depression before and I know it never really goes away (realized after I've been going through mine after the break-up) but would blame it on depression every time we got into a dispute. 

I tried to help and talk to her about it but she wouldn't do anything to help it. I know I could've handled it very differently after experiencing my own depression but it's really hard to understand when you haven't really gone through it. 

My ex told me at the end of our relationship that I was acting like a girl and put a tampon in it (she also cried when someone told her to do this at her work). She's the feminist, bi-sexual, etc and also said that she said that she thought I was the ""nice guy"". 

So I got angry and ended it. I said some not so nice things and told her just because I'm the ""nicer guy"" doesn't mean that I'm going to sit around and get stomped on. I know what I deserve.

I got angry and told her I'm angry because it doesn't have to every damn time. It can get old real quick and she told me that it's just a joke. Her: ""You can't take a joke?"" I told her you know I can and I joke with her too, but I don't do it incessantly. Also, if you see that I'm getting fed up with it, don't you think you should just stop?

She didn't really understand that because she doesn't have boundaries around almost anyone. 

Based off of what my friends and others (coworkers, family) have seen/ heard about her, apparently she was the one with a lot of issues that she never dealt with and she made it seem like I was the one at fault. This made me try to constantly win her back and I felt like the one at fault. So the issues that I had were almost never addressed because I would freak out, she'd back out, then I'd try to get her back. Cycle repeats.

relationship_advice,eps56un,t1_eps4glw,1559438021.0,">sheâ€™s the only girl Iâ€™ve had who stuck by my side.

That, that exactly. One day I hope for the same. 

But I'd say respecting yourself and her is very true like most have said. As for the ones saying showing weakness makes you less of a man in her eyes, I don't agree. If she can't be there in your weakest moments, is that really worth it? We're all human and that relationship like someone said ""sounds exhausting"". How long can that be sustained?"

unpopularopinion,eppz5c1,t3_bvbwm0,1559395631.0,"The worst thing to me about these dating apps is that when people break up, there's no reflection done (not always needed) because they can just go on to the next thing. This is creating narcissistic behavior and causing so many stuck-up people to never change/ understand what they can and can't control."
AskReddit,epluhwo,t1_epjldmi,1559303863.0,"She said to me ""you looked and seemed like the nice guy"". 

This didn't anger me until she said it again later. Just because I look or seem like the nice guy doesn't mean I'm going to go bite the curb. 

She loved me but didn't know how to love, communicate through the fights, be considerate, give the real work to be 50/50. 

I tried my hardest to be the person she could rely on but she didn't do it for me in my time of need. I call it being inconvenient for her."

Not saying it to be spotless by any means but just throw away things maybe not at that exact moment but without someone having to tell you. Also I know depression can play a big role in cleanliness of self and surroundings. 

My situation was very complicated (what relationship isn't) and I enjoyed everything with her except these."
relationships,eovoead,t1_eovgf3r,1558898324.0,"I mean in a relationship you should question each others decisions to a CERTAIN extent. You want to help make each other better. Either why make this decision when there's either a shorter or faster way to do it. It might create a more peaceful exchange, etc. Obviously very situational. Sometimes you also have to just let things happen for the other person to learn."
relationships,eovng3f,t1_eovmf66,1558897930.0,"Why not? Asking your SO to take a shower once in a couple days so that we can be near each other, especially when sweating at a job, is so hard for the person to do? When you're at someone else's place to clean up after yourself at least time to time. Obviously for her there wasn't much willingness to change but I'm asking if I'm justified in these situations."
relationships,eovmahu,t1_eovkkzs,1558897455.0,I do agree and I should've left awhile ago but with even basic communication aren't these things that can easily (not always) be worked through? I'm not asking for everything to be spotless and I know that I can get messy at times. Maybe we are just at very different stages in life. I believe these are basics to have in a relationship.
relationships,eov60qd,t1_eov3h6c,1558889316.0,I guess I just felt that these weren't things to get so blown out of proportion. I feel that if we would have been able to actually communicate to each other that this would've worked out but if someone is not willing to  work on these things (which to me seem fundamental for any relationship) then I'm just harming myself. Sadly to say that this was the first girl that I've truly loved and the loss almost killed me.
