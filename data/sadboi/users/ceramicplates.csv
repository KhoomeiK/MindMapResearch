zenbuddhism,fnj7qs6,t1_fnj2923,1586993565.0,"thanks for replying, i'm glad you understood me! 

i absolutely understand viewing medications as a temporary fix for a long-term, as that can be the case for some. for me, i've gone on and off antidepressants for the last 12 years. i am back on them again now, and it has been immeasurably helpful when combined with therapy appointments. i've had bad experiences with medications and great experiences with medications, and the same with therapists, but all were worth trying. sure it can take some fiddling around with prescriptions and treatments, but it's SO wonderful once you find something that works! 

please remember that you aren't weak for choosing to seek treatment for illnesses that are causing you emotional distress in your day-to-day life, just like it wouldn't be weak to see a doctor for a physical illness! you aren't weak for experiencing these things or for choosing to seek help. in fact, you are proving to yourself that you are stronger than these feelings! you are proving to yourself that you won't let these emotions-gone-awry control you and your life! that is an incredibly strong and brave thing. standing up to depression and anxiety and telling them that they cannot dictate your life anymore is powerful, and you should be proud of yourself. i'm sending you well wishes!"
zenbuddhism,fnf7e30,t3_g1aw9m,1586902772.0,"buddhism is not the answer to your mental illness. 

i have struggled with anxiety and depression for my entire life, and can say that letting buddhism into my life as a child helped me (and continues to help me) reframe my perspective on how these conditions affect me. however, there is no cure-all for anxiety and depression. every one of us is a unique individual with unique life experiences and therefore unique responses to different treatments. if you are struggling with emotional control and responses to negative stimuli, it's important to seek treatment from a psychologist or therapist to receive advice that is more personalized to you and your situation than any advice buddhist literature may ever be able to provide. 

personally, i treat my mental illnesses with a combination of therapy, medication, and mindfulness rooted in buddhism. i know that, to some, taking medication or receiving medical treatment for mental illness feels like giving up somehow. like we're ""supposed"" to be ""stronger"" than that. however, it's important to remember that a key part of buddhism is acceptance of the self as it is shown to us in our thoughts. if our thoughts are shrouded in depression or are skewed by anxieties, we need to accept that and accept responsibility to seek clarity. do you get what i mean? we cannot will ourselves out of mental illness. we must accept responsibility for our emotions and learn how to better exist alongside them, whether it's through therapy or medication or a combination of both. 

i hope that this makes sense. it can be hard to talk about! if you want to speak about this more or get some clarification, i'm absolutely open to it. i hope you're able to begin receiving effective treatment soon!"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fmxn8em,t3_fxm5cf,1586468158.0,"permanently cut off your supply and find someone who will hold you accountable! delete all suppliers/sources from your phone, tell them you're not coming around anymore. you can't count on them to hold you accountable for your sobriety since they benefit from your usage, so find someone outside of this part of your life who is willing to help you in times of crisis and temptation. the most immediate thought is an NA group, because they will hook you up with a sober/clean sponsor. check out the list of meetings post on the main page of the sub to find online/virtual meetings!

deciding to be clean is amazing, so you need someone else out there to help you remember why you want to continue down this path when things get tough. sobriety is a daily choice, and you have the power to choose it every day! you got this!"
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fmncyrh,t3_fvsup7,1586223259.0,"it's important to remember that the idea of life being ""better"" in sobriety is just a very simple way of saying that substance abuse makes all the difficult aspects of our lives that much harder, even if the pain is numbed while we're using. no matter how hard things are now, they would be infinitely, immeasurably, astronomically more difficult if we were using again. every time you think, ""everything is still shitty, i should just use again to cope"" i suggest that you make a list of all the shit you went through before that led to you deciding to become sober. remember all of the things you experienced and all of the pain you caused yourself and your loved ones. all the shitty situations you got into. i don't know about you, but i wouldn't want to go back to that time. it sucked! bad!!! making a list is a good way to reality check yourself and remember why you're sober and why you want to stay that way.

getting therapy has helped me more than anything else. i never used a 12 step program because the idea of a group freaked me out and made me uncomfortable. maybe i'm just too introverted or maybe i'm a coward, but i decided to go to a therapist individually and disclose all my bullshit that way. express all my self doubt. receive reminders of how much better i am when i'm sober and clean. something like this, a cognitive behavioral therapy, would probably be really helpful in your case too. it can take time to find the right person who you really mesh with, but man does it help. 

remember that sobriety is not a one time decision, it's a daily choice that we make. we wake up every morning and decide to stay sober, decide to stay clean, because we know that we can better face our problems and just plain enjoy living this way. yeah, things are hard sometimes. they're hard a lot of the time. that's just life. being alive means going through tough times, and living means pushing through them against all odds. you can do this. you know you can, deep down."

regarding social events, i think it's just easy for us to forget that socializing is good and fun the vast majority of the time, and that everyone at every social event is so wrapped up in themselves (us included!) that things can't possibly go as negatively as we think they will. just be patient with yourself in the moment and let yourself let go, let yourself push just a little bit past your comfort zone. inching past those trauma-formed boundaries will help you return to a new, healthy normal. it has helped me!

it's not your fault that you feel this way about making connections with others, but you can absolutely take steps to control the way you talk to yourself about it. just keep telling yourself that you're wanted and valued, and eventually you will start to believe it. it's corny, but it's true. positive self-talk is a key part of growing past stuff like this. 

when you're in a situation that causes you to feel uncomfortable or anxious, try to define what is causing you feel that way. try to precisely define the emotion you're feeling. (i use [this chart](https://thechalkboardmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/feelings-wheel-explained.jpg) a lot!) understanding your emotions like this can help with anxiety a lot, because it's easier to find a solution to problems when you understand them better! you know the red flags now, and you know your ""hard no"" things. you know the boundaries you will not cross, and that's perfect. with all of that in mind, you'll be able to take baby steps out of your comfort zone. you'll be able to push past the boundaries you had to set up to protect yourself in the past, because you *want* to. wanting to push your boundaries is amazing, and you should feel comfortable and safe within yourself while you're doing it. trust yourself!

please be as patient with yourself as you would be with anyone else. this is a daily effort! we can get there! i believe in you!"
