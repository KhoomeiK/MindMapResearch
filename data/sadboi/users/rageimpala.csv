Seriously, thank you for saying this, I think we all should do this. Collegeboard is a scumbag company, and the world needs to know about it. I also don‚Äôt understand why we don‚Äôt get ap credit for just passing the class, instead we have to take this 45 minute test to see if we will be able to get credit for college. It‚Äôs a years worth of classes and it‚Äôs sad that we were given a test that had different prompts, and does not honor the fact that so many students have an unfair disadvantage due to internet, interruptions, Covid stress, and many many other factors.

There are people in the United States and around the world that weren‚Äôt raised the same way, and don‚Äôt have the same brain he does, there are people that are suffering, and he has the power to stop it. And yes bill has done some work, and yes there is always something he could be doing even if he‚Äôs doing the most he can, but he seems to have left the problems that are tearing America and the world apart alone.
