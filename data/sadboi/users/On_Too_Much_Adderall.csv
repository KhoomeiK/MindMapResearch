AskReddit,fqvswle,t3_gkuryi,1589684437.0,"I work in a big warehouse, folding clothes and arranging clothing displays. The thing I hate the most is when shoppers completely destroy the tables, digging for a specific size.

1. On most of the displays, the sign says which sizes we carry, which sizes we are currently sold out of, and if there are any more of that item in the back. People do not read the signs.

2. When we set up the displays, we have a system. The whole table is supposed to be level, so we make a stack starting with either the largest or smallest of the item. Whatever is left of that size goes underneath the next stack, which is the next size up or down. And so on. Long story short, it makes it so that ALL sizes and colors are easily visible.

3. There are either 1 or 2 of us working in the department at almost all times (we never leave it unattended for more than 15 minutes when the store is open, and this is rare). You can come and ask us for help if you can't find the size..we know where LITERALLY all the sizes are and where they would be on the rare chance it isn't visible. Usually, the size doesn't exist or we don't carry it if it isn't there.

My favorite type of customer is the one who comes up to me and says ""hey, I'm sorry to bother you, but I didn't want to mess up your piles and I can't find my size. Can you help me?"" 

YES. YES, I would love to help you, and I'm gonna make way more effort than someone I catch digging.

She was out at the bar on a night off, and she was pretty drunk. She didn't feel safe driving home. She couldn't call a cab for some reason (I don't remember why... She didn't have enough money, or her phone died, or something.) All her friends were asleep so she couldn't call anyone anyway. 

So instead of attempting to drive, she did the SMART thing and decided to sleep it off in her car. She had her keys in the ignition simply because she was drunk and didn't want to lose them. 

The car was off when the cop found her, asleep in the driver's seat of her car. She was immediately arrested, since she was in the driver's seat and the keys were in the ignition, for ""intent to drive while drunk"" which translated to DUI including all the fees and jail time of actually driving drunk.

askdrugs,fqgohbv,t3_gijnl4,1589352059.0,"I used to have a dealer that was sort of my friend. He was friends with some of my SO's friends in high school and he seemed pretty cool at first, albeit a bit troubled. He always asked me for money so i occasionally gave him 10 bucks for a beer or whatever. No big deal.

For context, this was when I lived with my SO in his aunt's condo, before we could afford our own place (it was in a very upscale, private neighborhood in one of the richest suburbs in the state. There were virtually no break ins. This is relevant)

Interactions with him started getting...weird. 

My SO's aunt had bad feelings about him and so didn't allow him in her house. She allowed us to hang out in the garage as long as he didn't come inside. Her dogs HATED him was the main reason why, at first. The normally friendly dogs would flip a shit and bark at him and even try to attack him if he went in.

It was weird. Whenever I wanted to buy weed or addies from him, he'd stick around wanting to talk about random shit until I literally kicked him out (I actually paid him to leave a couple of times.) I didn't really care. He was just eccentric I figured, and had fallen on hard times.

Well one time I gave him $200 for a script of Adderall and it turned out to be strattera. I called him and asked what the fuck, he'd sold that to me before and knew I didn't like it. He said he genuinely didn't know it was strattera and thought it was Vyvanse (brand name amphetamine based pills that would have been okay with me) but that they made him feel ""kind of weird"" but he didn't want to tell me because he needed the money.

I forgave him. He was obviously struggling. 

Stupidly I let him continue to hangout with me, albeit briefly, and I didn't buy from him anymore unless he showed me the product beforehand.

Not that long after, when we were chilling in the garage, he seriously looked like a switch had flipped. He had a black eye, his clothes were tattered and dirty, and he was talking about shit like he took too much acid one time and now there were tapeworms in his brain, making him go crazy.

I got weirded out and kicked him out. 

The next day my SO's aunt's car had been broken into. All that was stolen was spare change from her center console.

I told him to never come back here again, and he didn't fuck with me for several months. 

Then one day I got a call from a number I didn't recognize. It was his brother (who I'd never met.) He said that he got my number from his phone and that he knew I'd been buying drugs from him, and threatened to call the cops. And that he had evidence.

So I explained the whole story to him. I explained that I honestly just felt bad for him. I felt like he had gone off the deep end or was close to it.

We had about a 45min conversation in which his brother explained to me that my old dealer was in a psychiatric hospital now and he wouldn't stop talking about how he got [my name] pregnant and that he wanted to see his kid. (I have never had sex with this dude and I've never been pregnant. He was psychotic)

I said that was ridiculous and that I definitely never had his child. His brother explained that he knew it wasn't true...they put him on mandatory hold because he had completely lost his mind

I wish I had this answer a few months ago. Relevant story

A few months, me and my fiance had no food in the house. Now - I love him to death but he is not the brightest crayon in the shed sometimes, and this is relevant. 

At that time, he and I were both working so much we didn't have much time to clean. We didn't have anything to make and not enough time to order anything, we were both hungry, it sucked, but I was like whatever I'll get food at work or something.

So I go out to smoke, come in and I hear the microwave going. I asked him what the hell he was microwaving because we don't have any food. He goes ""I found Culver's cheese curds by the sink""

Now, okay, there was a plate of old Culver's cheese curds by the sink. It had been there for give or take 5 days. 

It had been sitting out on a paper plate at room temperature and had been splashed with moldy sink water over the course of those 5 days. I don't know where it came from or why it was still there... I was drunk and put them on a plate and forgot about it, I think. And the next few days I had been too busy / apathetic to care about getting rid of it.

I say to them ""DO NOT EAT THOSE .... that will give you food poisoning."" And I explained to him what I just told you in the previous paragraph.

People might even think he's doing it out of spite, because it's so different from what was requested.

To give another example... If my favorite color to wear in general was white, I still wouldn't wear white to a wedding because it's against the etiquette to do so. I would forgo my personal fashion choices and wear a different color that one day. It wouldn't kill me.

If you had had sex with him and he hadn't told you - he would be the asshole, as I'm pretty sure it's the law to disclose your status if you know you're positive and have sexual relations with someone. 

However - if he's on medication, there is little to no chance you could have contracted it from a papercut on his hand, or something like that. Recent advances in medicine have made it so that people with HIV can become virtually undetectable meaning there is a negligible chance of passing it to someone else.

I have a story about this lol.

I (27F) used to live with my fiance(28M)'s mom and aunt (sisters, late 50s). They have 2 dogs. 1 is a pug with many health problems and very overweight. Generally though he's cool and pretty quiet, and doesn't cause problems.

The other dog is a perfectly healthy poodle, young and EXTREMELY hyper. She barks CONSTANTLY, I mean constantly. It's shrill and you can hear it outside, with the door closed, from across the street. The owner (my SOs mom) never really made the effort to train her.

I begged and pleaded with her to please train this dog. She peed everywhere and kept us up all night barking. She begged for food - whenever someone was eating she would sit at their feet barking and barking until eventually someone gave her a piece of her food. 

SO's mom said she didn't want to train her because it's normal for dogs to bark and beg. Keep in mind this dog also shits everywhere inside the house, pisses inside, and lacks the basic social skills of most dogs.

So, behind her back, I taught the dog the command ""shut up."" I just used treats she was allowed to have, as a reward for being quiet, and pet and cuddled her when she stopped barking. I did it one day in front of everyone, and she stopped barking.

SO's aunt thought it was hilarious and was like ""how did you do this??"" So I explained it, and she laughed and was like ""good job""

SO's mom was furious though at first ... She was like ""how dare you teach her something behind my back?""

It's like 3 years later now and the dog still responds to ""shut up."" Even SO's mom thinks it's funny now and she admitted she couldn't get the dog to listen to a single word she said, and that's why she was mad. 

It's not mean to teach a dog to be quiet, lol. Some dogs need that and as long as you train them in a way that is kind and patient, you're fine"

He just shook his head and said ""what the fuck?""

No, your husband's behavior is not normal or okay. He's showing a total lack of intention to communicate with you about your needs in bed, which is extremely selfish and frankly immature of him. 

He's also ignoring biology.... About 80% of women can't cum from PIV alone. This is because the clitoris is like the female penis, basically. We need direct stimulation to cum just like guys do so it's completely unreasonable for him to ignore that. 

Women have needs too. It's so sad to me that some guys still don't get this, even now in 2020 when there's plenty of research on it. 

Moreover, I don't know what he said to you, and I'm not going to ask, but if he said something so nasty to you that you sat in the shower and wouldn't even type out what he said to us, on here.... He's probably emotionally abusing you. This has red flags written all over it. 

I agree with the top comment - do not have sex with him until he agrees to couples' counseling.
