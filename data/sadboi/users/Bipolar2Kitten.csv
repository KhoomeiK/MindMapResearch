bipolar2,flndwl3,t1_fln9s27,1585316410.0,There are tons of people that live without medication and I wish they would chime in more here. I’m sorry that things have become so difficult for you. Normal therapy to just be able to recognize your signs might be helpful as well!
bipolar,flm2e27,t1_flm1sf9,1585272995.0,"Wow thank you! Yeah I felt that I nailed the legs, but struggled massively with the arms... and don’t even talk about the hands. I actually really want classes to help me improve on the proportions C:"
bipolar,flm248u,t3_fpnubd,1585272815.0,"I used to feel the same way that you did, constantly cycling and feeling really bad in my depressive states, but when I got out of it i just assumed it wouldn’t return and didn’t bother going to a therapist. I only ended up trying some normal anti depressants. 

And then I got hit with an extreme depression in July last year. I’m still fighting it and had to put my life on hold and it’s never been that bad for me before. Took me waaay too long to realize I needed serious help. 

I really recommend that you make an appointment if you think you may be bipolar. Bipolar is a progressive disorder meaning that every episode can get worse until hospitalization or at worst, take your life. So better safe than sorry!!"
bipolar2,flm1cjp,t3_fpb5jd,1585272311.0,"I think you should air out some mental illnesses and see what he/she thinks. Maybe say “Oh one of my friends is having it tough rn, she’s bipolar”. Get a feel first for how h/s feels about mental illnesses and then think about telling h/h. Good luck!"

bipolar2,fllfnpn,t1_fllfcb5,1585259429.0,I’m hoping my ride with bipolar medication will be quite calm seeing as I’m trying out the one my dads on! Sorry that your journey lead to nothing :((
bipolar2,fllfd3e,t1_flkrrwu,1585259269.0,"I’m sorry! My comment was absolutely not meant to attack anyone!! To me it looked like you said there were no evidence that medication works and that’s what I was correcting. I absolutely know that the doctors have no idea WHY it’s working and I 100% agree with you on that, it’s just that it looked like to me that you claimed no doctors or science thinks medication works at all. Sorry!"
bipolar2,flleyx1,t1_flkr6lk,1585259056.0,Yeah I’ve been on a few antipsychotics and that was a hell ride
bipolar2,flkoc4w,t1_flk8cou,1585244647.0,"I wasn’t gonna comment on any of these but I just wanna say that there is great science behind medication, but just like every single medication in the world, people are different and the meds don’t always work the same. There are millions of other illnesses that require you to have a trial and error phase with meds. 

That being said, I 100% agree that we are left with the bad sometimes and it sucks. But saying the medication doesn’t have good scientific backing is just horribly wrong. Your doctors may not have been very well informed about them, but that doesn’t mean the science isn’t there. To even start giving meds to patients requires YEARS of testing a very large amount of subjects. 

Why in the world would they push the medication on patients if they didn’t believe it works? 

So yeah. That’s my two cents in it. Everything else I completely understand and respect."
bipolar,fljn8wm,t3_fp7pzm,1585219797.0,"I can become abusive, but only for a short while and I always profusely apologize afterwards. I have however never hated my partner and I would never deny them help in desperate times. 

Please remember that bipolar isn’t an excuse for being abusive... If bipolars were just abusive 24/7 then I doubt any of us would have partners! And as someone else said, there could be a chance of BPD, as the things you are describing sounds more in sync with BPD. 

As for getting through... I don’t know tbh. If he has BPD then anything you say can be manipulation or an insult to him. But I suppose that trying to hammer in the fact that you can die and that you feel unloved would catch him. Good luck op. Hopefully you’ll be ok <3"
bipolar,fliufru,t3_fotcpw,1585190986.0,"My dad got extremely sick when he turned 30. Lost his family, in and out of hospitals, raging alcoholic, etc. then at 34 he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He got information about the disorder and started medication. The medication changed his life. In a few months he was already looking for a job. 

Now at 62, he has had a stable job for a long time, his alcoholism is under control and he has mended all wounds with my siblings. He never did get his wife back, but I don’t think he minds too much anyways. 

The stories are there <3 I’m hoping to be one as well soon! My dad has also saved my life and taken care of me whilst I’ve been really sick. I love him so much and I’m glad he managed to get through the tough times."
bipolar2,flistq1,t3_fozgic,1585189875.0,"I’m curious, if you found one that worked wonders, why did you stop it? 

And also to kind of answer your question about not taking meds, ehhhh not really... there is an extreme amount of evidence showing that medication is miiiiiiles better than any alternative treatment. They’re honestly not even comparable. Bipolar is also a progressive disorder, meaning that every cycle will get worse until it lands you in a hospital or early grave. 

I would seriously reconsider if the side effects are so bad that you can deal with just being bipolar. For me, the disorder itself is so bad that the side effects would have to be seriously bad for me to not be on one of the like what 10 different types of bipolar meds there are? Yeah it could be a long journey trying to find the right one for you, but I would choose that journey any day over just being bipolar. 

Good luck to you!"
bipolar2,flhzuac,t3_forr5h,1585172607.0,"Please take your medication regularly! There is sooo much evidence that the illness only gets worse over time without medication. Your depression can also very sudden become 100x worse without any reason. Going off your meds can also send you into an episode. Literally all research says that either going off or using it on and off is horrible for you! 

Please don’t listen to the stigma about having a mental illness or taking medication! You don’t have to tell anyone, you don’t have to talk about it, but please take the medication! On r/bipolarreddit there is a huge post about taking your meds. We all just want to feel good and we shouldn’t be shamed out of taking them!! 

Be safe please <3

Here is the thread about medication"
BipolarReddit,flhy925,t3_fovq67,1585171754.0,"I don’t know what country you’re in, but some countries quarantine doesn’t actually mean “stay inside and do absolutely nothing”. In mine (Norway) you can still go outside on a walk. So depending on your country, you could get away for maybe a couple of hours. 

Other than that I’m not sure. Someone said to record it and I agree with that. I’m terribly sorry that you’re in this situation. There are tons of these subs that can be there for comfort, some even have discord servers your can join.

Good luck <3"
bipolar2,flhwkd3,t3_foxft6,1585170836.0,"My granddad had undiagnosed bipolar and took it  violently out on everyone around him. My dad took it slightly out on others and became an alcoholic from a very young age. However when he got diagnosed and treated, he could understand everything better and he stopped taking it out on others. And I also take it out on others. 

The importance is to know you’ve done wrong and apologize. We have the same illness. Of course we’re going to be similar in some ways. But the same illness does NOT equal the same person! We all choose to deal with it differently, and you’ve chosen to take your illness in your hands and deal with it head on instead of insisting nothing is wrong! 

Plus, you’re also not a narcissist, so that ALONE is a maaaaaaaassive difference! I’m sure that the only similar things between you two is that you happen to share an illness <3 Keep fighting the good fight and change the stigma so that our generations children can more easily get help!"
