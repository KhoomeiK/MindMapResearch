It doesn’t make sense. Dorinda is going HARD for T and, IMO, Tinsley is handling it well instead of curling  up in a ball, crying. I think Dorinda is faking it & can’t look T in the face so just dismisses her. Tinsley knows it’s fake so isn’t getting too upset over it. Just a new dynamic, and at the end of the season T will be like Dorinda’s kid sister."

I was curious about the time frame as she seemed to have dealt with it ok but now I think not. She does need someone to come along side her & help.
