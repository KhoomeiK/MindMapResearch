They come in spend ¬£100 on one week's shopping for themselves, buy 3 different types of bread and 20 types of pastry. It makes me annoyed as a working mother me and my husband even though we both work don't have that much ""free"" money just to buy nice food with. Pisses me off. They could buy houses for like ¬£1000 and now we need a ¬£15000 deposit just to get a shitty little flat. Boils my piss tbh"
