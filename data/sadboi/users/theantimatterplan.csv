BPD,fjqeg9j,t3_feqpyk,1583571797.0,"This is like one of my worst symptoms. My therapist said 'when someone rejects you, you reject yourself' and like that hit me hard. 

Also, great job for learning about your disorder, knowledge is power."
BPD,fjqdmnf,t3_feqq6z,1583571552.0,"Its absolutely not your fault and anyone who tells you it is, is wrong. My family told me I wasn't trying hard enough that's why I had bpd.  But since then I've done a whole lot of research into the disorder and trauma and like its literally not your fault for what your brain does to try and protect you. I found researching my illness to be very helpful but you have to be very cautious of the information you are reading because even professionals will go off on rants and make us out to be terrible people. One website I found incredibly helpful was verywellmind.com 

Its also a great time to start treatment as there is a whole therapy just for us, its called dialectical behavior therapy! It was invented by someone who had bpd."
BPD,fjqbrye,t3_faw1e4,1583570719.0,Hi. Sounds like you need a new therapist. They sound like a very poor fit for you. Its totally okay to feel how you feel. Most therapists won't diagnose that early because a lot of the symptoms are also very common in adolescence and may not be a lifelong problem. It's not a diagnosis you want to be stuck with if you'll grow out of it so to speak. However it doesn't mean that what you're going through isn't completely valid and real. You would probably still benefit from a dbt course by the sounds of it. Where are you from? Can you look into other resources for therapy and support?

It's not personal though its just people who are frustrated with their own lives. Try listening to your favourite music in the car yo distract yourself from those initial urges?
BPD,fjgdcwm,t3_fda8zb,1583322868.0,Great. This is how I cope too. Even doing half a task at a time.
BPD,fjgd5x7,t3_fdb7yo,1583322655.0,My bpd didn't really get bad until my last year of uni when I started seeing someone who was using me. I think it can lay dormant. I was 23/24 when I started getting bad with bpd but always had mental health issues. I think the body suppresses things until it feels safe to deal with it. Its unavoidable. Some people suppress things for years and years and then have full on break downs in their 40s. Your symptoms will probably ease as you deal with your trauma.
BPD,fjgciwq,t3_fdbgmc,1583321936.0,"Hi. First of all, you're already doing a great job by seeking out advice and learning about the disorder. The best thing you can really do is be as stable as possible in your emotions and behaviors. Things like avoiding cancelling plans, showing up on time, being consistent with communication. People with bpd usually have problems with object permanence, so find it hard to conceptualize someone still caring about them and loving them when the person isn't physically there. Splitting usually occurs when the person perceives a threat of abandonment or danger. It's a primary comping mechanism that allows someone's brain to see someone as all good or all bad. Great for when you are a kid or in dangerous situations, less great in adult relationships. This can be avoided by using good conflict resolution skills and communication. However I think its beneficial to encourage your partner to do dbt if they aren't already because it will help them with splitting. Remember it's a partnership and is both of your responsibility to make it work. :)"
BPD,fjfcg1e,t3_fd50mg,1583288906.0,I think it comes under the rapid mood changes of bpd. So yes. Not sure if they still call it hypomania in the bpd context though.
