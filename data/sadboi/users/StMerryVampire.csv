FTMMen,fqlrpd7,t1_fqlgr78,1589464790.0,"I agree that OP should just ask his therapist for specifics, but that last paragraph, oof.

LGBT people & those with mental illnesses *do* experience people being ""out to get them"" at significantly higher rates than the general population. Because of -phobia & discrimination, but also because being gender non-conforming or having to manage symptoms of a mental illness make it harder to connect with others (for different reasons, respectively). It *is* hard to give people the benefit of the doubt when malice and ignorance are equally likely motivations, & regardless of intent, the end result can do you terrible harm.

I'd say the vast majority of people, when confronted with struggles like social rejection, dysphoria, being denied support systems or having ones that set you back instead of help, etc... react about the same that LGBT people & those with mental illnesses do. The reason that most people aren't reacting that way is not because LGBT & mentally ill people are uniquely out-for-blood, but because most people aren't experiencing that stuff."
FTMMen,fql8o9i,t3_gjii8p,1589450165.0,"Let me preface this by saying she's in the wrong, there's no good reason not to take a 21 year old seriously as an adult. I expected you to be like 16 when I read the title. That's ridiculous. But if you want to/have to keep working with her, you could ask for clarification. As in, ask what being an adult means to her, as what specific things about you she sees as immature.

If it does turn out to be dyscalculia, like you mention in your other comment, you then can explain to her that this is a disability you have, it effects other areas of your life than your therapy appointments, etc. (Again, that's not a valid reason to see you as immature, and as a therapist, she should know better. But people can be like that & sometimes you have to work around them.) If she gives other reasons, you'll be able to address them with her &/or work on them. Ask her what, specifically, she would see as a sign of maturity from you.

Side note, I think a lot of trans people don't fully feel like they can start living their adult lives until they transition. There was a notable change in my maturity & ability to be responsible for myself once I'd started hormones, just because I was suddenly able to leave the house & go about a normal adult life without getting constantly misgendered & judged. Your therapist is holding you back."

traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fqd5ox9,t3_gi4nql,1589280629.0,"100% agree. I think the language comes from the Reddit trans community's thing about ""sex vs gender"", which IMO is just insisting that a trans man is still ~biologically female~ in some essential way, & vice versa. Most IRL trans groups I know just say trans men, trans women, etc.

I get that transfem/transmasc are associated with nonbinary people, & sometimes hesitate to use transmasc because I'm a binary trans man... But if ""transmasc"" makes you dysphoric, doesn't the F in FTM make you a bit more dysphoric? For me, the answer is yes. I'm not going through the process of figuring out my gender & transitioning just so people (including trans people who should know how it feels!) can continue to call me female.

Obviously, we can use whatever terms we want to refer to ourselves. But the tendency to use MTF/FTM speaks to a mindset that I hope we move away from."

Nobody's pushing for ""no questioning"". (That is to say, it's a very fringe argument & is practically impossible.) But while an endocrinologist is going to be an expert on how hormones effect the body, they're not an expert on how a trans person experiences their gender. Their job should be to provide info on side effects & minimize health risks to their patient, not to decide who's worthy of hormones based on a personal opinion on what makes one one's gender."

It's genuinely sad how lonely he is, now that his kids have the legal right to distance themselves, but it'll never be sad enough to make me wanna talk to him for more than an hour or 2 every month or so. It's exhausting to live with someone who has a very specific vision of how his family should interact, and will pitch a fit if you challenge that for any reason.

Also, ""punch/kill TERFs"" jokes are certainly not to everybody's taste, but joking that you wanna hurt someone who's bothering you is a type of humor that's in no way specific to the trans community. (""I want to kill my boss"", ""my sibling's so annoying, I'm gonna kill them"".) This is not a problem that's endemic to the trans community. If trans people joking about punching/killing TERFs in enough to push someone over the edge into becoming a TERF, they were sympathetic to the ideology in the 1st place.

If you want to devote your life to optics & trying to win people over from ""the other side"", go ahead & waste your time. But if somebody truly wants to disengage from the TERF ideology, it'll take a lot more than us never making a violent joke.

Seeing as we've moved beyond that reductive line of thinking, I think the most compelling argument as to why she's still a woman despite presenting masculinely is cause she identifies as one.

How somebody dresses or acts may change how their gender is perceived by others (hence why trans men sometimes dress very traditionally masculine & trans women very feminine, to make it more clear how strangers should refer to them), but somebody's gender is what they identify as, not a sum of how they dress & how they act.

This concept can apply to pronouns, too, especially as language continues to evolve. Pronouns have specifically gendered meanings, but like clothes & social roles, they only have that because we've given them those meanings. People can mix & match, or eschew them altogether, if they feel that fits them better

I'm a binary trans man so I don't 100% understand, but I think we just have to recognize that the human experience is varied & take people at their word when they describe their experiences. I hope this adds to what OP is saying but IDK, maybe this take is a bit too spicy for the Reddit crowd lol"

FTMMen,flfmm8w,t1_fledi5a,1585110733.0,"I also get annoyed by overly performative allies, but trans men do have periods in some cases. I also very much had the attitude for a while that I would keep my head down until T stopped my periods & then never speak of it again, but I've been able to mostly work through that. Nobody's obligated to advocate for any issues, of course, but it felt very ""fuck you, got mine"" to disregard trans men who still get periods because it's not my problem anymore.

And even though I don't have periods, I still have to acknowledge the fact that I have a uterus when dealing with other issues from time to time. The solution for me has not been to pretend I don't have one, but to recognize it doesn't make me any less of a man. It's a male uterus, lol. That might be a little mental gymnastic-y for some, but IDK, just my philosophy.

The point of trans men being included in discussions about periods & such is to redefine them from being ""women's health discussions"". If some of the people advocating for that are cis people just trying to be ""woke"", I don't really see that as a problem, as long as the end result is that trans men (& any other non-woman who has periods, etc) are able to feel more comfortable with their experiences."

Saying the same thing in the same tone in a ""feminine"" voice can carry a completely different weight than were it said in a ""masculine"" voice. Like babies being scared of male relatives but not female relatives, abuse victims being triggered by men yelling at them but not women (speaking from personal experience, don't @ me).

If this story is true, & I'm not sure I'm willing to be that generous, it can pretty easily be explained by the person being having violent/abusive tendencies all along, but that being taken less seriously until they began to pass as male.

Increased irritability can also be a side effect of T, & it's also possible that this person's dysphoria lessening from transitioning gave them more confidence (or whatever) to lash out, but those are still situations where it made behaviors that were there all along carry more weight."

asktransgender,fkr7av7,t3_fk7o8h,1584463237.0,"I completely agree with you. I think the language you use to describe something definitely changes how you think about it. ""Passing"" prioritizes how other (mostly cis) people read us over how we feel about ourselves. I understand the tendency to think that people are rational & what hurts must be true, but cis people don't understand gender any better than we do. They clock fellow cis people wrong all the time. There are some folks who call all cats ""she"" & all dogs ""he"" because they view them as feminine & masculine respectively, regardless of sex.

The best mindset imo, is where you get euphoric (or however you'd describe it) from being gendered correctly, but don't value the opinion of somebody who gets it wrong. Enjoy being read as the right gender, don't give too much of a shit about anything else.

As for nonbinary people, I don't think the ""male"" & ""female"" categories of reading people are as rigid as people give them credit for, & certainly can change as society continues to. Even ""only 2 genders lul"" people get confused if somebody they meet is androgynous enough. But you don't have to be completely androgynous to be nonbinary obviously. Your social circle using the right pronouns for you counts as being read correctly. Maybe you don't ""pass"" as nonbinary to the general public, but shouldn't people who respect you enough to use your pronouns be more important than randoms on the street or people looking through your selfies for a ""tell"" so they can misgender you?
