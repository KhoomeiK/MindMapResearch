It set. Like clay.

Second of all, even if she was adopted, what gives you the right to harass her for for it? Maybe she wanted to keep that to herself. You are entitled for believing you have the right to that information. I'm honestly surpised you didn't face more consequences at work for being so rude and pushy."

For one, why would you EVER have to ask someone else for permission for any medical procedure involving your health. Especially not your sister.

Although I think we can all appreciate how your sister must feel and my heart goes out to her too, she had no right to tell you she should give permission. Your life situation is very different to hers and so your choices were relevant to your life, not hers.

The biggest asshole though is your mum for telling her. You told her a piece of medical information, SENSITIVE medical into, and she told your sister. The worst part is, she told your sister when she knew it would hurt her badly and make her more upset. If she really felt inclined to tell her she could have at least waited until her wounds weren't so fresh yanno?

Do not apologise for doing what you needed to do. You are not the asshole."
