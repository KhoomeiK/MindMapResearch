I went to Monash and lived in residential halls for a year, and I was pretty shocked by how messed up St Andrew's is. We had none of the hazing, abuse or plain disgusting stuff like shitting everywhere that seems endemic in some of the elite colleges. We partied and drank a fair bit, but it was a really inclusive, relaxed and supportive environment overall. And there was no extreme pressure to drink or go beyond your limits, we had a lot of international students who weren't used to the drinking culture we have in Australia and everyone was fine with that. We even had a few group movie/games nights where alcohol wasn't allowed at all. Worlds apart from the culture in places like St Andrew's.

The first night I took it, I woke up the next day and was actually refreshed - not tense and still exhausted, and feeling like shit because the nightmares just hang over me all day. I can tell the second I wake up if I missed my dose the night before.

Also, I started with 1mg and gradually increased the dosage. I also started taking it 3x daily (so every 8 hours) because it works really well on my daytime anxiety. I'm so wound up that sedatives have barely any effect on me so I don't really have to worry about getting drowsy from night time meds during the day (although I'm not sure if prazosin can cause drowsiness?) I take 3-4x the average person's ""knock out"" dose of valium just to temper my anxiety during the day, and I don't even feel sleepy.

I now take baclofen with prazosin 3x a day, baclofen is pretty good for anxiety and kind of works like valium, just without the sedation (or dependence issues)

Anyway, I hope you get good results from prazosin. It's been a literal life saver for me! There's a lot of leeway on the dosage, so if you don't notice a huge effect chat to your doctor about adjusting the dose (anywhere up to 10mg is safe, just watch your blood pressure if you increase the dosage - your doctor can check that, or some pharmacies have a free blood pressure check)"

ptsd,fr4pt5l,t3_gmbhr0,1589894367.0,"I'm sorry you have to deal with all of that. I relate to so much of this. Have you seen a psychiatrist? Even a good GP can help you, medication can make a world of difference. After more than a decade of battling my mental health issues and going nowhere, I was finally able to see a psychiatrist and get properly medicated - I honestly didn't believe things could get this much better so quickly. I had ADHD, C-PTSD, the usual anxiety/depression issues that come with both of those, and I've been passively suicidal for almost my entire life. Also some physical heath issues, eating disorder, massive sleep issues, fatigue, and so on. 

The biggest thing that helped me was prazosin - it's a blood pressure medication used off label for PTSD. About the only thing that ever made a real dent in my anxiety, and got it down to a manageable enough level for me to make headway on anything else. I'm now on prazosin and baclofen for PTSD, and ritalin for ADHD, and I still have a long, long, LONG way to go but it actually feels achievable now.

If you can, please see a doctor and talk to them about your mental health issues. You don't have to white knuckle your way through, and getting just a little bit of relief makes dealing with everything a bit more possible. Depending on where you live, a GP might be able to prescribe you medication without a psychiatrist diagnosis (for me, I had to see a psychiatrist for anything relating to ADHD, but my GP got me started on prazosin) I've felt the same way about mental hospitals in the past, but from ym knowledge they can be horrible places and you might not even get good treatment/diagnosis, it's more likely to be traumatising and they could just make up their mind about you and not actually do anything for you (but I don't know what the mental hospital are like where you live, they could be great. We don't have any actual mental hospitals where I am, it's either the ER/general hospital or the tiny palliative care ward that's for end of life care/terminal patients - and I'm in a country with a good healthcare system) 

If your anxiety is too high to see a psychologist, then see a psychiatrist - I has the same problem, both my doctors actually said ""no, therapy would do more harm than good until we get your anxiety down to a manageable level"" but medication has got me to that point - and a lot quicker than I would have believed, after so many years of going nowhere (or backwards) 

Try not to take what your mum says on board, I know it is impossible to *not* feel it sometimes but you can work on it. (Again, it will be so much easier if you can get your anxiety down to a more manageable level with medication) For me, realising why my mum says/does certain things helped me not take it so personally. It's usually a lot of projection (eg she calls me selfish, because she's the selfish one - only ever focused on her feelings, her wants, her moods. She makes mean comments about my weight, because she has a seriously unhealthy view of ""beauty"" and is always crash dieting, making her really unhappy and sometimes even sick - all over a few kgs, not even a big difference. Yet I eat what I want, try to keep my eating disorder in check and stay healthy, and we're pretty much the same weight) So basically, a lot of the time it might not even be about you - it's your mum projecting, deflecting, it makes her feel better to scapegoat/control you (and that is just so messed up, so please try and believe that it is NOT YOUR FAULT that's 100% on her being a shitty parent)

Pete Walker's book (complex PTSD from surviving to thriving) is a big help with the CPTSD side of things. Growing yourself up is a good one for relationships and personal growth (particularly for dealing with difficult people/relationships - my doctor actually told me to read it after yet another emotional breakdown in his office, after my mum was just ripping into me for absolutely no reason whatsoever and I just broke down saying I didn't know what to do or how to deal with the constant emotional abuse) I really like Jordan Shanks youtube channel for basic self help tips, but it is hard to take on self help advice until you get your anxiety under control. Pete Walker's book is good no matter how bad the anxiety is, he has some good steps for dealing with emotional flashbacks (which could be driving some of the anxiety/panic with PTSD) 

Sorry if this was a bit rambly (that's the ADHD) but I hope something in here can help you even a little. Basically, try and see a psychiatrist (not psychologist) don't listen to your mum's nasty comments (I know that's hard, but realise it probably isn't even about you) and read self help books (or there's lots of online resources too)

And if you can, try and make a little time for you. It sucks when you lose interest in things, but it can be anything - a hobby, playing with a pet, going for a walk, doing absolutely nothing - just try and have a little escape from everything. Mine are playing with my kitten, long showers where I can totally clear my head and let go of the stress/tension, and treating myself with favourite foods/snacks. Anything that makes you feel a bit less stressed, a little less unhappy, maybe even a small spark of joy. Even just something you don't totally hate, even doing nothing (which is practically meditation) just try and give yourself a little break every day"

My go-to is usually ""it's not the trauma Olympics"" that sometimes helps shut down the ""oh it could have been worse"" bullshit

But I really try to keep things to myself. There's a few friends I open up to, but I haven't gone into much great detail. It's more for when I have a weird reaction to something normal, or something triggers me and I spin out a bit, it's a bit easier for me to say ""never mind/don't worry about it, that was just PTSD brain taking over for a moment"" or something like that. Just so I don't have to try and explain the whole thing (which is really weird and long-winded, usually pretty depressing, and sometimes I just have no clue what triggered me or its too hard to describe)

But in general, I think it's best to kind of keep the details to yourself. Now of course you should share if you want to, I don't mean to shame you for opening up to people or anything like that, it's just that there's a lot of people who don't get it, and don't seem to want to get it. They'd rather just give you some motivational line, and that will just magically fix everything somehow* and then they don't have to actually think or empathise with the situation. 

I really hate the phrase ""post-traumatic growth"" simply because its so easy to see it being used as a way to shame people who are trying to work through PTSD. Like it's *just* our mindset. I get what they're trying to say with post-traumatic growth, but it just hits a nerve with me because for 99% of my life so far, everything has been minimised or denied or ignored - or I've been made to feel bad for *not* bouncing back and being perfect (or somehow better?) after trauma. ""No you don't need therapy, or even to talk through your trauma in an understanding, safe environment. Just turn all that into a positive!"" That's not how it works, at least not for me, and people insisting otherwise actually makes things worse. 

Excuse the rant, but that's why I keep things to myself. It's either used against me (in the case of abusive people looking for weaknesses) or people minimise it and make me feel like shit, or they get weird and pull away because I'm suddenly ""too much"" It's great when you find people who are understanding and empathetic, but they are few and far between

Investing in a good electric toothbrush really helped me. I have the oral b 9000, and I'm already a lot more consistent with brushing. I love the sensitive and gum massage settings (especially as I have really sensitive and weak teeth, I actually chipped a tooth brushing last year.

Plus I can never get rid of the fuzzy feeling completely with a manual toothbrush 

A good electric toothbrush is definitely worth the money, it costs less than 1 dentist visit and it will serve you well. I have one of those Colgate wisp pocket toothbrushes next to my bed, so I can give them a quick freshen up when I'm too lazy and unmotivated to brush properly. Also, if you snack lots try and drink water afterwards and give your mouth a  bit of a rinse, so the acids/sugars don't just eat away at your teeth for ages. Gum is good for that same reason, it makes you salivate more which neutralises some of those acids/sugars.

There wasn't that much interaction with other workers, except on lunch breaks, but it was a really healthy work environment. They paid well (not great, but above the minimum) but they treated workers like actual people. No shit over taking time off, whether you were sick or needed a holiday, if there was an accident or injury they got OHS on it right away, gave the employee other work if they couldn't continue their usual job (like office work, or completing some training so you'd have a pay bump when you got back to your regular work) lots of small bonuses for finishing a big project, regularly making it to work on time, every Christmas (with a Christmas party for the families, free gifts for the kids)

It was just their whole attitude, and all the little things they continued doing to make their workers feel appreciated. And that bought a lot of loyalty, along with better productivity - so win-win. And there was no sniping or that general bitchiness between employees that you often find in workplaces. One bar job I had was great too, but again that came down to the owners and managers treating us like family and actually looking out for their employees. I've worked at plenty of bars/restaurants where that isn't the case, and they were some of the most stressful workplaces I've been in (along with the worry that your hours will just disappear at the drop of a hat)

So I think you can find a good environment and sense of community in a lot of industries, probably more in the people-forward industries (so arts/tourism/hospitality/manual labour) than office jobs, but it often comes down to the company/employer and what sort of environment they create in the workplace"
CoronavirusAustralia,fqcxamp,t3_ghzms7,1589272120.0,"I'm not sure about where to buy masks right now, but I've been sewing fabric masks (for myself and the family) and also some for medical/essential workers through a volunteer group. If you'd like to give it a try, the ""Olson"" mask or the ""citizen"" mask are good, comfortable fabric masks with a pocket for filter material. The University of Florida round pattern (with halyard sterilisation wrap as fabric) is the pattern I use for medical workers

If you need help finding patterns, or what fabric to use, I'm happy to send you a few links. If you're reusing masks often, try to have a few (at least 5 is best) and store them in numbered paper bags, so you can rotate them correctly. Hang them in the sun for a bit if you can, otherwise 5 days in a paper bag should be fine. CDC website has some good recommendations on reusing masks. If you want to properly sterilise them, a pressure cooker works quite well as a makeshift autoclave.

If you're wearing masks for long periods, straps that tie behind the head are a lot comfier than elastic ear loops. And make sure to properly shape the nose wire when you put it on. Practice wearing it around the house a bit, so you can get used to it and adjust it, so you aren't fiddling with it the first time you wear it out

I have seen a lot of etsy stores with fabric masks lately, there are probably a few aussie sellers on there. I find the curved/shaped masks fit a lot better than the surgical mask shape, and they are usually a bit more comfortable to wear."
ptsd,fqcw5nl,t1_fqb99ep,1589270982.0,"I know it can be frustrating, especially with doctors, but there probably is a reason for it. Just try to be there for her, and let her overcome it with support, rather than pressure or feeling 'forced' to.

I really struggle to open up, even to my doctors. Ten years ago I was struggling with a bad depressive episode/flare up, I couldn't keep food down, eventually my GP sent me to hospital for IV fluids because I was going into shock. At that point I could barely stay conscious when I was standing up, and I still really didn't want to go to hospital because I didn't think it was ""bad enough"" and I was being ""dramatic"" (my boyfriend basically dragged me there)

Well then I experienced the cruellest, worst care I have ever seen from doctors. I lost a lot of blood thanks to a nurse not knowing how to take blood right (even though I already had all the tests with my GP, that's why she sent me to hospital) I was treated like I was making it up, they disregarded my doctors orders, refused to give me fluids, accused me of being a drug seeker and kicked me out. That experience still haunts me today, I really struggled to tell even my current GP and psychiatrist about it, and it stopped me seeking help so many times over the past decade. It didn't help that I was always discouraged for seeking any help, even urgent medical care, as a child - that last incident was just the icing on top

As for police/government, it really only takes one or two events/incidents to really trigger those alarm bells every time in future. I was followed off the highway by an off duty cop, who proceeded to verbally abuse me and threaten to arrest me (for simply flashing my lights at him twice, when he was going under the speed limit in the overtaking lane. I didn't even beep my horn at him, just accepted it and waited for my exit) After that, whenever I saw my neighbour (who was a cop, known him since I was a kid) those alarm bells would go off. I wouldn't even recognise him, my brain would just go *POLICE! PANIC! SOMETHING IS WRONG AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE* even though I *knew* it wasn't the case. And it frustrates me more than anyone else most of the time.

It just takes a LOT of good/neutral experiences to outweigh the bad one(s). Support and understanding will help a lot, just try not to push her too much. Think of it this way - say you got mauled by a bear. For a really long time, you'd be really jumpy and uneasy around bears, even if it never happened again. You'd probably avoid being near bears, and everyone telling you ""that'll (probably) never happen again"" wouldn't be of that much comfort. But you could get over your fear in time, but not by someone throwing you in a cage with a bear and telling you to get over it and face your fear

Also, I highly recommend Pete Walker's book Complex PTSD: from surviving to thriving. And r/CPTSD"
SebDerm,fqcu3t1,t1_fqbd5b0,1589269002.0,"[Nak scalp to hair](https://nakhair.com.au/products/scalp-to-hair-range) I used the ""energise"" kit, it really helped with breakage, hair fall, and scalp issues

> TOPICAL ACTIVES: Aminexil, Niacinamide and Co Enzyme Q10 penetrate the scalp skin, targeting sensitised and ageing hair follicles, eliminating unwanted DHT, which is considered the main culprit triggering thinning in sensitised hair follicles. Fortifies existing growth cycles, to help slow down the signs of thinning.

And avoid sulfates if you can, I can only afford cheap supermarket shampoo these days and I think almost all supermarket/drugstore brands are going to have sulfates, so I just use whatever works for me. If I had the money I'd only use salon quality shampoo and conditioner, but I have to make do with what I've got

I'm not sure about MCT oil, I haven't used it myself. I did find that most oils work ok, just be extra observant when you try a new one out so you can take note of the effects and differences. I also quite like macadamia oil, or any oil blends, but jojoba is my favourite. It's chemical structure is really similar to sebum, so it mimics your natural oils in a way, I think that helps it sink in really fast. I just buy it online in the plastic refill packets, it's about $12 for 100ml. And you can mix up any oil blends yourself, I did jojoba/castor oil for a while, but castor oil is just so thick and sticky. Jojoba just melts into your skin/hair so well, and usually won't leave oil stains everywhere.

But use what you've got, a good scalp brush will really help too, if you want to try another oil go for jojoba. Anything will do though, I've used moisturising/leave in oils too, it all works. The longer you can leave it on the better, overnight works well if you can put up with oily hair while you sleep. You can add a little tea tree oil or peppermint oil, I find they help with dandruff (just make sure you really dilute it down, start with just one drop diluted in your hair oil) 

One other great product is ""Moogoo scalp cream"" it's a bit messier, but really helps when my scalp flares up a bit. You use it in a similar way to the oil treatment, just give your scalp a good brush, rub the cream in, and leave it in overnight before washing.

And those microfibre hair turbans are good for wrapping your hair up while doing an overnight treatment, so you don't ruin your pillows

[My scalp brush ](https://www.tangleteezer.com/all-brushes/detangling/the-original/plum-delicious.html)

The most important thing is just to do what works for you, so just be observant and don't be scared to tweak things. And you don't need to go all out on it, I find even just exfoliating my scalp with a good brush before I wash my hair helps the dandruff a bit. Good luck!"
SebDerm,fqanjrz,t3_ghqwut,1589222089.0,"Nak scalp to hair always worked amazing for me. My hair literally felt stronger after using it, was really good on my scalp and significantly reduced my hair loss from scalp issues. I just can't afford it any more. I don't think anything would react with medicated shampoo, it's saw palmetto, Q10, mint.

 I really like the dove destress ritual for supermarket shampoo, nice and gentle but lathers really well. It's a strengthening and moisturising shampoo, my favourite cheap one

The Schwarzkopf supreme length (oily roots/dry ends) is a really good moisturising shampoo too, one of the few that I feel I could go without conditioner. Definitely a strong runner up

The sunsilk 2-in-1 is ok for a lazy in-between wash, but my hair is noticeable more limp/thin when I just use that, compared to the Dove and Schwarzkopf ones

Also, what really helped me was exfoliating my scalp a bit before washing it. I bought a tangle teezer brush (any scalp brush will do, that one just works best for me) and I'll do an oil treatment on my scalp, leave it on for a bit (overnight is best, if you can put up with it) and then give my scalp a good brush/ex foliate right before my shower. Brushing before the oil treatment, as well as after, works even better. Any face/hair oil can work, jojoba worked the best by far for me, and it doesn't get so sticky as other oils/sinks in quite fast. Idk if that will work for everyone, but it's been one of the only things to really slough off that layer of flaky skin for me (and my mum now too)"

I just went high pressure (compounded by having to juggle multiple jobs to get enough hours to barely survive) and then crashed, rinse and repeat. And a decade later I finally worked out it's ADHD, and was able to get diagnosed and medicated. 


 I've been getting into self help over the last few months, and through that I've found some great advice and resources. I still have like 4 books half read and a long reading list after that, but I'm making some progress at least. Someone posted an ADHD schedule for working from home in this sub, I printed that out - and while I don't stick to it completely yet, it does give me some good guidelines (like do this task for this amount of time, then have a break to follow that random thought, etc)

Check out Jordan Shanks on youtube, he has a good self help Q&A that breaks down some good principles into basic, easy to understand bites. A lot of it is on time management and becoming more productive. Keep in mind he does speak from a (mostly) neurotypical mindset, so not everything will apply 100%, but he has some really solid advice on little things you can start doing every day to condition your brain. I loved his recent video on meth  - it was all about how to program your brain to give yourself little hits of dopamine when you complete a task, so you train yourself to be motivated to do it, in a sense. And it pretty much comes down to clicking your fingers (and associating that with good emotions) 

And keep a notebook with any little quotes or habits you'd like to set, really anything that speaks to you, makes you think, or you think ""I should remember that for later"" And regularly read over everything, it'll help you remember and keep track of your progress and focus

Definitely find a DES provider (even if you aren't on disability, if you have partial capacity to work you should be with DES) Sometimes you can check their reviews on seek or Google (look at the local office reviews) don't bother with the reviews on their websites

""*mmmm yes YES PLEASE YES*"" (I bought her a stuffed fake spider after we had this giant huntsmen sitting on the window one day, she was watching it all day and kept calling me over to come see. Now the bug is her new favourite toy) 


And every time I give her a pat, she does that little ""brrrrp"" trill/chirp noise. I honestly never knew the joy of all these adorable cat noises and conversation before now

CPTSD,fpo9hj5,t1_fpo4qe4,1588780694.0,"I love the book ""Think like a cat"" it so perfectly explained some of that. And I just loved getting to know who my kitten is, not forcing her to be something else, and it's so much more rewarding. I feel like I'm spoiling myself when I spoil my cat with new toys, a big cat tree, a bird feeder outside the window, a bunch of cat-safe plants that she can chew on. Watching squirrels on cat TV instead of actual TV (then buying her a stuffed squirrel, that she carries around the house with her)

And after my mum had been harping on for months with ""you can't train a cat, that's dumb"", then she sees my cat doing actual tricks (and more than our dogs had ever learned, put together) she says ""oh, well you should have trained our other cat then""

Me: ""how old was I when we got that cat?""

Mum: ""hmm... 1 year old""

*I wait for her to realise how ridiculous that is*

*she doesn't*

Yes your one year old daughter should not only be raising herself, but your pet as well (and then her younger brother later on) rather than you taking responsibility for raising any of them yourself. Seeing as you are the parent and you actually chose this and literally took responsibility for these lives, and you can't even be bothered to read one book about it. And then when your kids grow up with issues, you wail and lament that your kids ""just had it too easy growing up"" and you should be even less of a parent in response. Like, what the actual f***"
raisedbyborderlines,fpo7dud,t3_geif7n,1588779661.0,"Read ""Growing yourself up"" my GP recommended it after I was in full meltdown in one of my checkups, thanks to yet another emotional rampage from my uBPD mum. It's all about relationships, self awareness, maturity, and how to foster good relationships in your life.

Also, ""Complex PTSD: from surviving to thriving"" might be really helpful to you as well, it's all about healing and ""reparenting"" yourself when you didn't have a healthy upbringing

And ""understanding the borderline mother"" for... Well working out why she acts like that, it does help with navigating some of those explosive behaviours, and anticipating the (over)reactions a bit

Jordan Shanks on YouTube has some great self help videos, there's plenty on various relationship issues (it's basically a self help Q&A) he breaks it down into very manageable chunks, and he keeps it light and relatable

And just in terms of opening up to the guy you're seeing (or anyone really) remember you don't HAVE to share any more than you want to, and please don't feel like you have to push yourself out of your comfort zone for anyone. Growing up with a BPD parent, you never have boundaries and you learn to put other people above yourself, and it's really hard to unlearn that. And it isn't going to help any future relationships. Now that doesn't mean shut yourself off to people, but you DONT have to explain every little thing. You're busy all day? Just say you're busy. If they ask why, you can just say something like ""family stuff, nothing worth talking about"" or whatever suits you. When it comes to being indecisive, it's totally OK to say ""I don't mind"" or ""you pick"" or ""surprise me"" (like if you're getting food/drink or shopping) or if it's more like favourite movies/hobbies, that kind of thing, you can just say you haven't decided, you like trying new things, or here's a few things you like. I could never ever pick one ""favourite"" but when I realised - firstly - it doesn't even matter, and - secondly - no one actually says it has to be just one, it was somewhat freeing for me. I'd often say ""hmm, I dunno, what do you like?"" and then chime in with ""oh, yeah I love that too"" or ""cool, what do you think about x?"" It's more about the conversation, the back and forth, than the actual subject sometimes. And when it comes to memories, you can say you don't really want to talk about it, and then get into *why* later on (if/when you feel comfortable sharing the details, or even just the broad strokes) or just say you have a shitty memory, that was often my go-to (plot twist, I was diagnosed with ADHD at 28!)

That's just my thoughts, coming from a similar family background, but what ever feels right to you. Especially with messy family, it's probably better to err on the side of undersharing, rather than oversharing. And it's ok to just say ""my family is complicated/messy/a LONG story, let's not talk about that"" or something along those lines. You'll get better with practice, read lots, get into self help (I avoided it for so many years, thinking it was some airy-fairy crap, but it's exactly what will teach you how to grow and be a better person, both internally - to yourself - and externally - with others, in relationships, work, dealing with family)

And remember it's ok to make mistakes, no one is perfect, and it's better to try and fail than to not try at all. Screwing up means you are learning, and honestly if you lose a friend over something tiny like saying the wrong thing, or you were pushed outside your boundaries, then so be it and you're probably better off. It's harsh, but if they did it over some little thing, then even if you didn't do that it would be some other thing on a different day. And sometimes they'll come back and reconnect, and that's ok too. Just do you, and try to be the best you that you can be"
CPTSD,fpo2vn7,t1_fpnhkl6,1588777391.0,"Hangxiety, oh I love that. And I'm exactly the same with hunger, I just don't feel it until right before it's excruciating, it feels like my stomach acid is just burning a hole in me, and then I get nauseous and sweaty and dizzy, and if I don't eat immediately it's like a switch is triggered and I can't eat for ages without puking it up. I was actually sent to hospital by my doctor for emergency IV fluids, it got that bad once. I was slowly going into shock, and by that point I was struggling to stay conscious at some points. What *REALLY* didn't help was basically getting refused treatment at the hospital, despite an actual order from my doctor for fluids (not drugs, or other treatment, just saline) They took another blood sample, despite having the results of the one I just had done, and the nurse forgot the vial and only went to get it AFTER inserting the needle. So I was essentially bleeding out waiting for her to come back, about half of the hospital blanket was stained with blood. And I was barely able to keep my blood pressure high enough to stand up before getting there. And then they told me I didn't need fluids, accused me of faking when I fainted trying to stand up, called me a druggie (I hadn't even smoked a cigarette, let alone taken drugs, in my life - up to that point at least) and kicked me to the curb. So that REALLY didn't help me with being too afraid to ever ask for help (and I was already terrible with that, like refusing hospital when I really should have gone, and I only even considered it because other people were freaked out and begging me to let them take me to the ER)

But I did learn to be ok with snacking. I have some jelly snakes next to my bed for emergency sugar, or I'll grab a piece of cheese or bread. Just plain, easy food I don't have to prepare, I can just shove it in my mouth and get *something* in my stomach. I had some dental work done last year, and had an oral health education session, and the whole snacking thing came up. I explained my whole blood sugar thing, that sometimes I just need to snack or i can get quite ill, and it was so validating when she said that if I need to snack, then do it, of course that's ok. Just try and rinse your mouth out with water afterwards so it's not as bad for your teeth. I was so taken aback when she just listened and worked through the problem, gave me workable options, rather than just telling me off."
CPTSD,fpo092l,t1_fpnelav,1588776027.0,"I got a kitten just under a year ago, and I was so focused on raising her right (ie to be happy and loved and well adjusted) at the same time as discovering how messed up everything I learned growing up was. It actually helped, both things sort of fed into each other a bit, and it made things tangible in a sense. Lots of positive reinforcement, praise, cuddles, only nice words (sweetie, beautiful, cutie instead of bitch, loser, c***) And my little kitty is amazing, she follows me around like a dog, always comes running when she hears me, so talkative (we have whole conversations of meows) so well behaved, and even learned some tricks - her high fives are especially cute. A big one was spending time doing ""cat stuff"" - so taking the time to do what the cat (or child) wants to do, and often needs to for their healthy development. Not just expecting them to do what I want to do, and not really giving a shit about them outside of that.

And then the big realisation that I can't really remember that from my childhood, or much of the other healthy childhood stuff. But doing that for my kitten is actually therapeutic, I'm reparenting myself at the same time.

Plus I now have an amazing little kitty too. I woke up from a nap yesterday, and she was lying next to me with her paw in my hand. My heart just melted

Anyway, it is possible to reparent yourself without actual role models. If you want a fluffy family member, it can be quite healing to raise a kitten or puppy along with your inner child. If not, parenting books - but also any of the books on C-PTSD, adult children of alcoholics/narcissists, etc

Growing yourself up is a good one for relationships/dealing with other people, fostering good relationships and personal growth (it takes some of the guesswork and catastrophizing out of ""omg why did they do that, what did I do wrong, *ARE THEY MAD AT ME*"")

POTS,fpmnx67,t1_fpmayz9,1588737307.0,"Pilates is good, I often just do the warm-up exercises from my poledancing class (which is basically pilates) There's probably some decent YouTube videos as well.

The 4hr body has some good home bodyweight/weight training exercises. Big thing is just not to push yourself, try and find things that don't have risky movements, you want nice, small, controlled movements. Things like sit ups, but touch your elbow to the opposite knee (then switch) or do ""cat"" pushups (start on hands and knees, curve your back as you scoop/go down. Get as close to the floor as possible, then go back up. Curve as much as possible, you'll look like when a cat stretches with its butt in the air) Planks are good for core strength, and you really don't do much, just go into push up position, facing the ground, resting on your toes and forearms. Then just hold that, keep your tummy tight and your back straight. 

Situps with a resistance band or towel wrapped around your calves (so you have to use your core) I could do 50+ normal situps, barely even 1 with the towel trick. That's from 4 hour body too.

If you have money to spend, a mini trampoline or those vibration boards are good options. Every time I did a quick workout, and then used a vibro board, I felt my muscles ache 10x more (and its really gentle, low impact)

Just go slow, don't push yourself outside your comfort zone.

Blogilates/Pop pilates is a great free resource for home workouts, and they have a free calendar/workout plan. Lots of free printouts and videos, the girl that runs it is so enthusiastic, and makes it all really accessible (even if you're way out of shape)
