Permaculture,fr5f7iu,t1_fr5ck0f,1589907574.0,"love sunflowers. Cant grow 'real' ones thoughbecause I live in farm country and the winds take down most things that are taller unless they are super sturdy or flexible. Tried for a couple of years to grow gladiolas and they just would not stand up, which they are kinda known for but I didnt realize at the time. They were cheap and plentiful so I went for it. For some reason hollyhocks are strong enough to hold up as long as I put them in a more wind blocked area, but sunflowers kept winding up face down on the ground before they finished making seed for the birds.  Alliums and echinacea seem to do great though. I do love that gardening is a yearly learning process of figuring out what will thrive and what just cant deal with your particular areas condition. Sometimes its a great and other things will break your heart lol."

Permaculture,fr547cc,t1_fr4j29c,1589902203.0,"oh yeah, we started with just a couple of plants under the pines, and little grows in the area so I left it thinking this looks familiar and the birds liked it. Googled it later when I realized how much it had spread in just a few months and realized this may be a problem. On the plus side, as long as you boil it a little its fairly safe to eat, so its a good wild food to have around in case next year is a 'starvation time' late winter. I have found several good foraging plants have landed here in the last few years that we can add to our diet if need be."

Treated like shit by resident, threatened with DCS, nothing came of it but it was a hard couple of experiences that taught me not to trust medical professionals as much.

 Held off on third childs shots because of it.(one year) and at the time whopping cough wasn't even a reg vaccine.. but my family got it prior to the state starting them again when the outbreaks started. Wound up getting both in for that and to catch them up with what they were behind on which was bad for the youngest who had to get 4 separate the first visit.

Most humans don't even live in the present moment, but instead are forever focused on the past memories or projecting themselves into imaginary future situations... so they miss that life and existence only exists in the now. 

So the form is alive and conciousness is like an ocean we live within. It expresses itself through living matter based on the forms make up and abilities. Like a rock can't be a whale but the same concious energy flows through them both and each expresses and experiences it based on their physical make up.

When the form dies and can no longer experience concious awareness, it simply dissolves into the ocean of consciousness again, and instead of being directed through the eyes ears skin ect of that single individual, it is part of the awareness of the entire universe again.

Energy can not be created or destroyed. It is simply forever moving into and out of form."

Normally we might get a light frost in early may, throw sheets on everything and it's fine.  This is 28-30 degrees from sunset until morning.  ðŸ¥º"

gardening,fpt57pd,t1_fpt403p,1588885067.0,"christmas lights no but love the idea, might play with that one if I can find the old white lights. The hostas, I guess, I dont know once the leaves freeze if they will come back and make new or not . Worrisome because some of them are 10 years old. Tomato plants are about 2 foot tall. I dont think pulling them for 10-12 hours will kill them, but know a hard freeze will. Debating on doing one shovel scoop, into a big plastic tub and then having someone strong help me drag them inside for the night. Geesus what a lot of work when we are so close to the last freeze date. Starting to wonder if we really ARE though, the weather is not acting right at all."

They are extremely uncomfortable and looks like something from star wars (Darth maul?) I want to be thankful because I'm sure they are better than homemade masks... but all I can think is they will scare kids they are trying to help,  and worse,  someone tripping on drugs could potentially freak out and hurt her."

So I snipped and dipped two of them and started them in their own pot. Now that I know they do well in a water jar nursery, I plan to start a couple more. They will make great gifts for family this year. :D"
