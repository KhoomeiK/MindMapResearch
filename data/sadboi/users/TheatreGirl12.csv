depression,fevc5qh,t3_eqkzx8,1579395669.0,"I can relate. I think it’s because parents know their children better than anyone else does. They know how to push buttons and poke where it hurts, and if a parent(s) does not have depression, they can’t comprehend the struggle so they preach and tell you to stop being sad. I’ve been through the same. I’m always on edge when I’m home because they know where my soft spots are and I don’t want them exposing my feelings to anyone. I can’t hide myself from them and they’ve seen me put myself in the hospital suicide watch. They always remember me as the angry suicidal “over-dramatic” teen instead of the adult who is doing her best to get out of bed every morning."

dating,f8me1ep,t1_f8ct7dk,1574630520.0,"Well I can’t speak for everyone, but in my experience, hook up culture has taken over. It’s hard to avoid. My advice to you is have that ONE experience of losing your virginity and learning how to have sex as a special occasion. Something meaningful and fun with someone you know and/or care about. It’s the closest you can be emotionally and physically to another person. Enjoy that connection. Hookups are best for instant gratification when you feel loose and want to have fun without an attachment. The key is DO NOT expect a relationship to come out of it and be upfront and honest about your intentions always. No point in hurting someone’s feelings by lying and getting their hopes up then ghosting them so you can remain unattached. Same goes for you though, don’t get attached if you’re going to hook up. Its good to explore and learn and experience the body of another person, but you don’t have to sleep with several people or lose your virginity just because everyone else has. I waited, then threw mine away and I regret it to this day. You have a lifetime of sexual experiences waiting, but you only lose your virginity once."
dating,f8cnpwu,t3_e07fbn,1574464445.0,"It’s absolutely OKAY to be a “non hook up” person!! I chose to lose my virginity in a hook up. Worst decision ever in my opinion, but other people like hooking up. The most important thing is it is YOUR choice. Just because people are sleeping around, doesn’t mean you have to. You choose the time and who it will be with. Go with your gut. If you are ready and just want to get it over with, go for it, if not, it’s okay to wait for that special person too! ☺️"
SingingTips,f10ns6b,t3_cuydym,1569115094.0,"I have been a singer for over ten years and I still get butterflies before a performance! You’re not alone! 😁

One thing that definitely helps is the more often you sing in front of others, the less you think about how scared you are. I know that isn’t a great answer, but you have to get up in front of people more often that you can jump onstage, think “eh, fuck it” and (very importantly) remember to have fun. You’ll still feel a little nervous and your adrenaline will kick in, but you audience does want you to succeed! ❤️

That fear is ALL in your head. You have to train yourself to think “Alright, let’s do this” instead of “Oh god, I’m so nervous”."
PCOS,ezayo4r,t3_d0j1y4,1567809928.0,How much is it typically to get this done? I guess it’s dependent on where you live but I’d like to get more info on this! I’m in WA
PCOS,eylynp9,t3_cxfoho,1567195160.0,"You should get your blood sugar level checked. If you have issues with low blood sugar, Keto won’t be good for you. I have EXTREMELY low blood sugar levels naturally and since you can’t do sugar on Keto, I felt faint and sick all the time. It may be the same for you. Maybe try the Whole Foods diet too. I’ve been doing that and I feel much better and am starting to lose a little weight."

I highly doubt you are ugly as sin. I’m sure you’re lovely. I’m sorry if I made this sub seem snowflakey, it wasn’t the intention. Just needed to reach out from a dark place and to ask for help."
PCOS,eyfzyeo,t1_eyfzajw,1567058469.0,"I wouldn’t say you struck a nerve. I guess I don’t understand your animosity and your aggression towards me or my post?

Even some of yours."

PCOS,eyfyu9o,t1_eyfax4e,1567057811.0,Thank you for the confidence and support. I really needed some encouragement ❤️ you’re amazing!
PCOS,eyfye04,t1_eyftd8y,1567057566.0,"I respect your input. Thank you for your opinion.

I do agree that putting such emphasis on beauty is a ridiculous notion. You’re right, dependency on the attraction to others isn’t a positive or healthy thing. 

But there’s nothing wrong with wanting to have someone there to love and be loved back.

I’m allowed to voice my frustrations and worries. My weaknesses and my strengths. I’m allowed to feel scared and alone, as well as confident and supportive. That’s why I reached out. Most of the time, I’m just as strong and hard and tough as you are. However, I’m also not afraid to show when I feel overwhelmed, scared, and vulnerable.

Sure, I’ll admit my post was a bit dramatic, but that’s doesn’t make my feelings any less valuable. I wanted to be heard. Kind people from this sub heard me and answered with comfort, support, options, and shared their own experiences. (Thank you all for your kindnesses to me, a stranger, and thank you admins for this group!)

If you don’t like my post, that’s fine. You don’t have to. I don’t expect everyone to agree with me. But, no one wanted or needed a “reality check”. Who gave YOU the right to give one? 

Life doesn’t have to suck. We all need a kind word and a helping hand sometimes. I’m sure even you do too."

PCOS,eyfm4rs,t1_eyflpo2,1567051009.0,Yeah I’ve already seen a gynecologist and nutritionist. Neither really helped. Gyno just shoved papers at me saying that I have PCOS and to research it myself and take pills and the nutritionist told me she wasn’t a therapist and to use portion control while having an intern in the room taking notes like I’m a test subject.

PCOS,eyfele9,t1_eyfdv6b,1567047612.0,I know and I’ve been so strong against that until this point but the last two years have nearly destroyed me. I gained so much weight and feel helpless and I HATE feeling like I have no way out beside medication and killing myself with work outs

They think I need a “kick in the ass with tough love” or “no more enabling”. I don’t want either of those things. I just want someone to understand me. To hug me and tell me I’m beautiful just as I am and to help me learn to love myself. I can’t do that by myself. I’ve tried for years but obviously I can’t do it."

Distancing myself and pulling further into myself to avoid being a burden to others or risk other hurting me. I’m having such a hard time dealing with having PCOS and being depressed. It’s so hard."

I’ve needed to take a mental health day for awhile but I feel like I can’t because then Im inconveniencing everyone else. They treat me nicely when they need someone to cover for them or stay overtime, but now I just feel sick from all the anxiety. I’ve been clinically depressed for 10 years and I know when I can’t handle anymore. I get extremely edgy and I sink into my “dark and gloomy” place and end up feeling angry and drained all the time. If I take one day off, then I’m being dramatic and “making it up to get out of work”. I understand your struggle!!!"

depression,etsnyay,t3_cd0hjp,1563150695.0,"Functional depression is awful. You can do everything “normal” people do. Like written, you can get up, go to work, perform daily tasks and seem perfectly fine. The crucial difference (at least for me) is you feel nothing. No excitement, no joy, and you’re very careful not to look forward to anything because it’ll be taken away from you. Everything and everyone exhausts you, making you feel like you’re the negative dark cloud looming over them yet, it’s not something you can control. You try to include yourself, be part of a group, try your best to be fun, but it’s ALL an act. You become very good at pretending your brain isn’t telling you that your a waste of life and no one wants you. Then you don’t tell anyone how you feel because who wants to listen to a “sad” person."

depression,erj4g3p,t3_c24wax,1560915418.0,"It takes strength to get up in the morning. It takes determination to get ready to leave your home. It takes amazing motivation to retain a daily routine of school/work life, personal life, and upkeep with hobbies! It takes endless amounts of new perspectives, bravely facing new challenges, and accepting ourselves as we are day in and day out. And guess what? You ALL have done it again! You’ve made it another day. You’ve conquered another challenge! Lived another chapter in your life’s story. Life isn’t supposed to be easy. Where is the fun in that? The best thing about living to adulthood and going through this long lifetime is the risk of failures and the rewards of living another day of experiences? Is giving up simply because the unknown future is daunting or scary or doubtful truly a sound reason? 

I understand you. I see your feelings. I’ve felt them. Deeply. Sometimes, I still do. But I sit down and truly think about JUST the good experiences I’ve had in the last day, week, month, and year. I think about how I’ve achieved things the 10 year old me would’ve never thought of. I’ve cried over things I miss from childhood. I am 25. I still remember being 21, in college, thinking school would never end. But four years later, I’ve had lots of adventures that were unexpected and both great and painful. I’ve lived 25 years so far, I want to be there for another 25, and then another 25 because it’s scary, but I’m also curious to see who I’ll be and what I will do by the time I’m 50, 75, or even 100.

Again, I understand. I totally get it. Being alive can be very exhausting, irritating, and downright maddening. But I challenge you to pick up your feet, find new adventures and strive to make life interesting. And sure you’ll get tired, life won’t make sense, and it’s really scary to not know what’ll happen, but that’s also the best part. 


Good luck ❤️"
