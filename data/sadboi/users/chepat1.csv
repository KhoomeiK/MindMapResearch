Empaths,fqpuus8,t3_gka9wx,1589554395.0,"Its not something you can turn off, but you can work to adjust so that it doesn’t have such a negative effect on you. If you can reach a balanced approach, you may find that it can be advantageous in certain situations like your close friendships.

There’s a song I really like that perfectly describes being an empath.

hsp,fqpsi9y,t3_gk5970,1589553157.0,"I absolutely relate to this 100%.

I also have a really good memory, especially when it comes to people and remembering details from their lives or their personalities. I refer to it as my “mental filing system.” People have their own FBI style file in my mental filing cabinet. When I’m about to interact with someone (or multiple someones), I pull their file(s) and quickly download all the facts and details I’ve gathered over time and use that information to enrich our interactions and help me navigate social situations. Often people will share stories, facts about themselves, or even their mental processes, intentions, or motivations for a certain behavior, and I will already know. Sometimes I even say, “I know,” which can be annoying, but I’m really just trying to show them that I pay attention because I care about them. Sometimes it’s taken well, and sometimes it’s not. It depends on the person for sure. 

So, over time and with different people, I’ve learned when I can be open about what I know and when I should keep it to myself. Our intuition and empathy can work so well that it’s a little off-putting to people or, like you experienced, they just don’t believe that we’re capable of knowing what we know since they haven’t been made privy to the information as we have.

Gifted,fqhrjgn,t3_gj04dy,1589382963.0,"Pursuing music is not a waste, and music has had just as many gifted individuals in the past and present as other fields (like math and science) have had. Take Mozart, for example. He was a child prodigy. He started touring Europe before he was 10, and this was back when traveling was much more dangerous and took much longer to do. 

I can’t tell you how many music professors I’ve had who seem like geniuses in their own right because they are incredibly knowledgeable (not just about music but languages, technology, philosophy, business, visual art, etc), accomplished (writing books, creating music software, performing abroad in operas or conducting symphonies), and are extremely good musicians to boot (piano, voice, violin, cello). 

Whatever you do, work hard and don’t assume that any field is invalid because it’s not what’s expected of you. Music is not easy and you do have to work hard to be good at it. Don’t sell yourself, or music/musicians in general, short. If you think you’re above music because of your superior intellect, then please don’t do it."
adultsurvivors,fqhlr8m,t3_gittw2,1589379557.0,"Well... what does being an adult feel like? If you are still young, but have reached the age of adulthood (most would agree between 18 and 21 with some room on either side for different circumstances), then you are an adult and the way you feel is the way an adult with your personality and specific life experiences feels. I know that’s probably not the answer you were looking for, but it helps me. I am 27, and I have always struggled with being perceived by my family, my peers, and myself as acting my age or being mature. My body feels 70, but I am really intelligent (not trying to sound arrogant - it actually took me a long time to allow myself to think I am intelligent) and I know how to get things done that most people my age or younger would call “adulting.” 

Side note: I hate the term adulting. I don’t want to type out my explanation right now so see this article for a quick thought...

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/news/amp58946/stop-adulting/

However, because of what I think was a really sad and messed up childhood, I often feel like a victim of circumstance, helpless, and just plain childlike in my need for affection, attention, and the level of care I crave from others. My personality has always deceived others into believing that I am always happy and bubbly, and people rarely ever acknowledged my thoughts and feelings until very recently. I can’t tell how you how many times I’ve been told I’m crazy, or that I’m always “so happy,” or how many times people younger than me have thought they know so much more or are so much more mature just because I *seem* bubbly and happy and don’t always share the really deep thoughts I have.

Basically, I understand what it’s like to feel stuck. Life... time... they don’t stop just because we are stuck in the moments that are so traumatizing to us. Becoming an adult (the journey through adolescence) is complicated, but don’t fall into the trap that society has set for us by believing that you are not an adult until you feel like one. Feelings are fleeting, temporary. Feelings change.

Feeling the way you do isn’t wrong. It’s understandable, but I think we have to do the work of accepting what happened to us as fact, healing from it, improving ourselves, learning from it, moving on, and helping others. I think that’s a strong indicator that you are reaching an adult mindset.

I hope this helps. You’re not alone in feeling the way you do. Take care. 💚"
infj,fqgk3ro,t1_fqgj1on,1589348403.0,"That is absolutely understandable. It sounds like you hold yourself to a high standard, which is great - nothing wrong with that, but you can be too hard on yourself. (I’m just saying what I am perceiving, not trying to label you or pretend I know you because I obviously don’t.) In this situation, I definitely agree that you could have taken a moment shake it off and refocus. If you were to join the meeting late, I don’t see why you couldn’t mention the technical difficulties (not as if you are making excuses for tardiness) just as an explanation for being a little late, apologize, and let everyone know that you are ready to jump in. As a leader, you want to lead by example (being on time, etc), but I think employees appreciate it when you can be real about a mishap and then power through it. It shows that you are human, but that you aren’t willing to let a little thing stop you from doing the job and doing it with gusto."
infj,fqgh618,t3_giqxe5,1589346160.0,"I think preparation is great. However, I think that, in addition to the preparation you already do, you need to mentally prepare yourself for the most difficult part for you, which seems to be delivery. At some point in your preparation, you need to try to simulate your “presentation state of mind.” When you are practicing your delivery, pay attention to how much energy you give the thoughts that are counter-productive to what you are trying to accomplish. For example, when you begin your presentation and realize you didn’t prepare a specific greeting for everyone, are you only able to think about your lack of preparation in that moment? Or wondering what everyone must be thinking about you? How does your body respond? Is your breathing shallow? Is your heart pounding? Do you feel a flash of heat creep up your neck and across your forehead and cheeks? Are you only focusing on everything that is going wrong in that moment? When something goes wrong, focus on calming your physical responses - your breathing, the tension in your neck, shoulders, jaw, and hands. Your physical stress affects your ability to focus and adjust in the moment. 

When you feel like you’ve lost your train of thought or forgotten an important point, do you panic? Do you use your mental energy to scold yourself for making a mistake? This is counterproductive and it only exacerbates you more. Instead, take a moment to breathe, collect your thoughts, and recommit to getting your point across. You may think that everyone will be frustrated with you or think you are weird or slow for pausing, but in reality, this only takes a couple seconds. If everyone believes in you, going as far as electing you for this leadership position, you can trust that they already respect you and want you to succeed. Most people are not going judge you for taking a moment to collect yourself so that you can proceed with confidence and clarity. Not to mention, if you are in charge and it is your time to give a speech or a presentation, no one is going to leave. You have their attention and you are in charge of their time. Own your moment without apology. 

Building up this kind of awareness takes time and practice. It definitely seems impossible during presentations, at first, but practicing during your preparation, when there is less pressure, goes a long way.

And, finally, remind yourself of the positives as often as possible. Take comfort in them. Some positives include but are not limited to...

“I am really prepared today.” Just don’t use this as a reason to berate yourself if something goes wrong. No one is perfect. No leader is perfect. 

“My colleagues care about me and they will understand if I need to take a couple seconds to compose myself.” Sometimes the pressure we believe others are putting on us is actually pressure we are putting on ourselves to be perfect and perform perfectly for them. Give yourself room to be human.

“I will be ok when this is over, and it will be over sooner than I think. I will do my best to enjoy the experience and learn from it.” You will be ok. Even if you are anxious and even if it doesn’t go the way you want, you will be ok. 

I have a lot of experience with presentations, teaching, and performing. If you have any questions or just want to bounce around ideas, please feel free to message me. I hope this helps! 💚"
hsp,fqgckvo,t3_giqar7,1589342898.0,"I have never been diagnosed with anything, though I suspect I have plenty of things to be diagnosed with like anxiety, depression, and PTSD (based on a lot of research - unfortunately, I haven’t had the time or money to seek a professional diagnosis). I definitely think that what I suspect is wrong with me is as severe and compounded as it is because I am an HSP with trauma and stress. But sometimes I wonder if I would ever get an accurate diagnosis that considers my sensitivity and past traumas because the research on HSPs suggest that our sensitivity magnifies negative childhood experiences. It just seems like it would be very difficult considering that awareness for sensory processing sensitivity is still really low. 

All the research I’ve done has said that it is very important to educate yourself (not saying you haven’t) on what you think is going on and what other doctors have said is going on, and to bring organized thoughts (typed out if it helps) to your doctor when you discuss symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments. Basically, be a well-informed and proactive patient and don’t allow your doctors to run over you. Yes, they are experts, but you know you better than they do. If your doctors don’t listen to you and respect you, then seek help from someone who will listen to you and take your concerns into consideration when diagnosing and prescribing treatments and medications. 

I’m sorry if your experience and results have been discouraging so far. It’s not easy to learn that something is wrong and the healing process can be difficult as well. Take care, friend! 💚"

Empaths,fqcifmf,t3_gi1ij8,1589259035.0,"We empaths do tend to take on other people’s energy as you called it or you can also think of it as a mood or a mindset. So, say your mom is angry. You can feel her anger, but you may also be able to feel what is causing her anger or motivating it. You can also feel how you are responding to her anger - with your own anger or with fear or discomfort. You may even find that, in addition to your initial response, you feel guilt or shame. Our ability to empathize can have a snowball effect in both positive and negative situations.  We can become overwhelmed by the emotions of both others and ourselves. This is one of the biggest challenges for an empath.

Unfortunately, I don’t think there will be a time when you have completely overcome the tendency to take on unwanted/negative energies. I think part of it is practice. Start becoming more self-aware. As empaths, we are already aware of the emotions around us, but we have to be vigilant about how we allow those emotions to affect us. Practice recognizing your own emotional state and being aware of how it changes in response to the emotional states of others. 

There are two mental health apps that I use that can help you with identifying your moods and even tracking them over time, if that’s something you’re interested in. They both have free (albeit limited) versions that work well enough to get you started. 

Youper 
Moodpath 

Once you can recognize how you are being affected by emotions, engage yourself mentally. Basically, talk to yourself. Ask yourself questions. Let’s go back to the example about your mom. Maybe ask yourself if you have done something, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, to make her angry. If your mom is prone to irrational and/or emotionally immature behaviors, it is possible that you have done nothing wrong, but that she is projecting her own frustrations or insecurities onto you. Reassure yourself that you have done nothing wrong, that you don’t have to be drawn into her negative narrative. Distance yourself from her emotions by rationalizing your reason for doing so. This is important to do with all kinds of negative emotions/situations, not just anger. Like I said, this takes practice. But it is so rewarding when you start to make progress.

Also, maintaining personal boundaries helps too. This does apply to physical boundaries, but I also just mean what you will and will not allow in your life. If you are still living at home and will be for the foreseeable future, this can be incredibly difficult - especially if boundaries are not well-established. Do some reading or watch some YouTube videos on establishing boundaries. That helps a lot.

I’m sorry you are having a hard time. This situation won’t last forever. Hang in there! You are not alone! 💚"

Don't let me sink into their grave
Just gotta be alone today

Her panic starts, I hold my breath
Still I can't avoid the pounding chest
I try to run, I trip instead
As my spirit enters in her head

A million voices cloud my mind
A shattered heart, a shattered life
Just tryna have a peaceful night
But this stranger’s soul is tied with mine

I don't wanna bear this weight
But their blood starts pumping through my veins
Don't let me sink into their grave
Just gotta be alone today
Just gotta be alone today

Feel like the weight of the world
I'm not strong enough
Don't know where to run
Would you hold me up
Oh, I'm crumbling down
Sink into the ground
Would you lift me up, lift me up

What I’m trying to say is, you aren’t alone. I haven’t had the same experiences, but I know what it’s like to feel worn down, discouraged, and pathetic. BUT I will say that you, my dear, are made of some tough stuff.

Have you considered typing up your parents’ medical histories so that you can just email or fax them to the hospital for new admissions, etc? It may take a while once, but at least you’d only have to update it occasionally and it would save you time if these hospital trips persist.

What I’m learning, through a lot of research, is that we have to allow ourselves to grieve.
