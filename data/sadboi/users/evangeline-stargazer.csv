Some lashes start to grow in weird though after week 4. So I would say do a trial run, see what you think and if they need to tweak them (for me the first time they didn‚Äôt use a tight enough rod so I didn‚Äôt notice much difference but they fixed it a couple days later) 

Then time it perfectly for your wedding day? :)"

It‚Äôs strange, but I don‚Äôt feel like I can really talk about this with any of my friends. I will keep going on with my life as I always have, and keep dating as I always have... and also keep thinking of him as I always have üòÇ Maybe one day I‚Äôll meet someone else with the qualities I want. 

I guess I‚Äôm kind of regretting going because it left me with these feelings again and for what?"

And granted, yes, it‚Äôs only been a couple days but I just find it strange to not say anything after the trip we had and the history we have. I don‚Äôt mind not talking for however long it takes to see each other next, but a response would be nice you know? I really just wanted to leave the door open because who knows what can happen in the future."
ChildrenofDeadParents,exd7ipr,t3_cs64br,1566169223.0,"My gal, I feel you so much. In February it will be 8 years since my mom passed and I still miss her so much. Her death showed me a lot of awful things and I have cut off almost her entire side of the family. I haven‚Äôt seen or spoken to any of them in a few years now and I feel so much better to be honest."
depression,ev8bzda,t1_ev2vna7,1564275075.0,Well I didn‚Äôt get anxious!! I went for a walk to the grocery store so I wasn‚Äôt sitting in my room and I didn‚Äôt notice much...I think it did lift my spirits...but that also could have been the walk. I‚Äôm going to take another 0.5 tomorrow and keep taking it every few days until the end of August I think to see if I notice a big change.
depression,euyeh64,t1_euyddcs,1564100738.0,"Ahhh ok. Yeah mine are definitely potent and I think I'm properly storing them. I have them in a ziplock, inside a Tupperware, stored in a cool cupboard. 

I just took 0.5 so we'll see how it makes me feel"
depression,euyc0h9,t1_euyb8ig,1564099270.0,"3 grams didn‚Äôt cause you to trip?! I usually take about 4 for a really good trip lol. I think for micro dosing you should be taking like 0.25-0.5 grams worth 

I took 1 gram a couple weeks ago and felt that way. Very tense and anxious and just wanted it to pass ...which was me testing if I‚Äôm in a good enough mindset to take a decent amount and I know I‚Äôm not there yet right now"
depression,euy8kfm,t1_euy6nio,1564097069.0,"I‚Äôve had amazing trips that have changed my outlook too, but this is specifically for depression than anything else. Something I want to try as I‚Äôve reached a really bad point and don‚Äôt want to go on other meds"
ChildrenofDeadParents,euy0hjb,t3_cen1o5,1564093972.0,"I feel very similar to you. My dad passed when I was 5, my mom when I was 21. Both were from drug overdoses. I disowned my moms side of the family because of what they did to her, which I found out through all of her writing after her death. I knew some things while she was alive, but not the extent.

I moved out at the age of 14 because I couldn‚Äôt handle her lifestyle. I still loved her though even when we had our issues. She was still my best friend even though she kind of sucked at being a mother. She taught me a lot though and I appreciate that and miss her everyday. 

My brother is off trying to make his own family and we rarely ever see each other or speak.... 

I have extended family in Toronto (I live in Vancouver) but I am also the black sheep, so I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from. Recently my entire life went to shit and the police seized my vehicle because my roommate was a drug dealer and I have a lawyer fighting for it back and am just working to survive and it feels like bad thing after bad thing just keeps happening. Wrong place, wrong time but I‚Äôm usually in these situations due to having no where else to go. 

When does it all end?!"

That's what my whole life feels like.  I like myself well enough, and my own company, but I can't shake the feeling that i'm too broken now to have anything resembling normalcy.‚Äù

I felt this whole paragraph so deeply. This is exactly what my whole life feels like too"
ChildrenofDeadParents,euxy011,t3_cfv2fc,1564093104.0,"My mom passed when I was 21. I‚Äôm going to be 29 this year. My dad also passed away when I was 5 and I remember finding him and have some memories of him, but most of my life before the age of 14 has been blocked from my memory. 

I found that I avoided my grief for years and only in the last couple years started to work through it. 

My advice to you: everyone truly grieves differently and whatever you feel, whenever you feel it - is not wrong. I felt like I was doing everything wrong through it and that burdened my soul even more."
