When I do have these shitty mindworms (like earworms, because they can't get out of my head), I have learned to acknowledge them and quickly move on from them, because they aren't helpful to me. (I think this is based in grounding yourself to remind you of the present moment.)

Hope this helps - you're not alone in having these annoying thoughts."
