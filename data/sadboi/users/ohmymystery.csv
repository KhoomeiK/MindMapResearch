As a woman, this is exactly what “too nice” means.  It doesn’t mean that we don’t like being treated well.

What we don’t like is being put on a pedestal and treated like the Emperor with his new clothes. 

It is TRUE that women are attracted to strength, but what most incels and “nice guys” don’t understand is that strength doesn’t necessarily mean physical strength.  Hence, why we don’t all gravitate to muscley dudes.  

Emotional and intellectual strength are just as attractive and this is what “nice guys” lack.  No one wants a partner without a backbone.  And yes, I said partner, because being attracted to strength in its many forms does not mean women want to be submissive or subordinate.  We want an equal teammate who can pull their own weight."

I get real frustrated on St. Patrick’s day, especially when I see friends and acquaintances who are clearly not Irish making fools of themselves and making mockery of one of the worst Irish stereotypes.  My ancestors were forced to leave during the famine, which I actually know my history about beyond “there were not potatoes”, and the injustices my family faced absolutely form part of my identity and drive me to honor them.  I stand on their shoulders. 

Another reason that my Irish heritage sits so strongly in my heart has to do with the fact that my other two ancestries don’t technically exist anymore.  I’m also German, but by way of Prussia, and Slovenian, by way of Yugoslavia.  I recognize the beauty of both cultures, but it’s hard to identify with a geographical landscape that has shifted mightily since my people left.  Trying to trace backwards gets messy quickly.  Conversely, Ireland has more or less a linear history to it, so it’s easier to trace your roots and find meaningful appreciation for where you come from.

That makes it REALLY difficult to act.  Sex crimes are notoriously difficult to prosecute (trust me, I know plenty of women including myself who never bothered to report their assaults to law enforcement simply because they knew it wasn’t worth the hassle since there was little chance of anything happening).  

It’s easy to say, for instance, that suspected priests should just be withdrawn or reported to law enforcement (as if law enforcement has a great track record of handling sex crimes anyhow!). And withdrawing a priest that could actually be innocent?  That’s a grave matter indeed, as the spiritual damage to the parish or priest himself could be extraordinary.  When dealing with an ecclesiastical vocation, innocent until proven guilty is even more critical than other situations.

CatholicDating,eyva67p,t3_cyxhjc,1567485817.0,"As a recovering alcoholic, I see pornography in the same light.   It’s an addiction.

When I was at my worst, if someone had come and suggested that I quit drinking, I would have gotten pretty angry and cut them off quickly.  It was only by hitting my bottom and wanting sobriety for MYSELF that I was able to make a change.

An ultimate bottom is harder for a porn addict to teach, since it’s not literally lethal, but you can help them understand how it’s affecting you and the relationship in order to help get them there.  Never accuse.  Never tell them what to do.  Just tell them how you feel and how it hurts you."

religion,eyssb0k,t3_cykwhi,1567410504.0,"When I had to plan a funeral for someone deeply close to me, the priest said that a lot of people “receive their First Communion” at weddings and funerals simply because there’s not a lot of wiggle room to explain who can and cannot receive, while still respecting the gravity of the occasion.  Even if you put it in the program, some people don’t see it or ignore it and receive anyway.  

This is all to say that, while not great, it’s not uncommon for this to happen and if you were truly ignorant, it’s not a sin.  You know for next time (or maybe you’ll consider trying out Confession?  I promise it doesn’t hurt!)"
