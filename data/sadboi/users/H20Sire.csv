( and please keep in mind, I am not qualified and I am not trying to diagnose your brother in any way. I am just trying to give you some advice) 

I would say light-medium depression, as it seems like he still has the interest to “do” stuff. 

One of the main signs of more “severe” depression (in my opinion) is when you lose all of your motivation and interests, and while he has stopped working out he still has his passion for playing games as far as I can tell. 

And, he has no right at all to act the way he does no matter if he is feeling terrible or not. I play video-games as well, and I also have my not so proud moments of “rage”. But I always make sure to not disturb my family, and stay relatively quiet. 


It doesn’t seem like he’s got a lot of friends because of the circumstances, and I know personally that a loss of a loved one can hurt you more then you think when you truly are lonely. 

I take it as he maybe didn’t “care” that much about your grandpa, but I bet they still had a good relationship. 

Being lonely and then losing one of the few people that care for you truly makes you feel lost, and it can truly break someone. 

This is the most likely thing that I can think of, but there is no way to know unless he tells you himself. 

He stopped caring for his health, he isolated himself,stopped caring about his hygiene, basically just given up after your grandpas death. 

I think the best that you can do is to have a serious talk with him if you can manage, you really need to try to make him understand how serious it is and that you are worried for him. 

Try to find out what it is that he “wants”, why he is acting this way and you really have to show that it makes you worried and sad. 

Of course it could have been something else that happened at the same time, perhaps bullying at school or heartache. That’s why I think your best option is if you want to help him that you have to have a really serious talk with him."

The same way the women body is “designed” to carry a child, the male body is built for making and protecting said child that’s just the biology of it.

It’s just something that you have to “force” yourself to do, as it gets easier the more you do it"
depression,fovdiif,t1_fovc98g,1588099501.0,"Its very hard, I used to get a lot of anxiety during the evening because it’s then I “let” most of the pain out and have a lot of time to think. 

I couldn’t sleep, I almost got panic attacks and it sucked. 

But after a while I’ve managed to “stabilise” my emotions more, and while I still am depressed I feel much better then earlier in certain situations. 

Life also (for the most part) feels “stable” living, instead of earlier when I barely could be able to go through each day. 

You just have to let yourself be sad for certain amounts of time, but if you feel like your just going to dwell on things which won’t help you and you get “stuck” then it’s time to just go for a walk or some mild exercise 

(Or something that you enjoy doing)"

(Don’t mean to put words into your mouth if that’s not the case, just what it seems like)"

depression,fouc03e,t3_g9n383,1588081068.0,"As a point of advice which I have had to learn myself is that you can’t put yourself above other people, claiming that you are more intelligent and smart (even if that’s the case) because then people don’t want to spend time with you."

Was there something specific which happened? Did you have a argument, or anything like that?"
depression,foubfx9,t3_g9n7o1,1588080725.0,"Try to do small things, like just walk up out of bed and try to go for a walk or some light exercise.

I know that there is a strong temptation which makes you feel energy less, but you will be able to move if you really put your heart to it"
