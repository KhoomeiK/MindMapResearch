this is a term that became popular because of a particular book, Animal Liberation, where Peter Singer references some researcher and *that researcher's own term* for the device. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/books/adventures-of-the-white-coat-people.html

> In his later years Harlow -- who at this time was, in the words of one of his research assistants, ''a terrible drunk'' and ''always, always intoxicated'' -- devised new ways of tormenting monkeys. Since the maternally deprived female infants grew up into neurotic adults who would not allow a male to mate with them, he constructed a ''rape rack'' -- his term -- so that he could tie them down while males mated with them.

even if you don't admit that an animal can be raped, they're exploited and forcefully impregnated for profit til their bodies give out (whatever you want to call it, the process is the same). you addressed a minor aspect of their comment and nothing else of the torturous exploitation described."

vegan,fqieqje,t1_fqfqwy0,1589395016.0,"> Well... we are biologically meant to eat meat. 

We are capable of eating meat, but we don't need to eat meat. ask any of the vegans here in great health that literally haven't touched meat for years, most of their lives, or ever. 

> And usually, from my experience, those who try veganism usually have more health issues than those who eat a balanced diet.

A plant based diet can be a balanced diet. Your anecdotes don't really have anything to do with the reality that meat isn't necessary for a healthy(and health-promoting) diet. eating haphazardly in the western world, regardless of what diet you follow, will probably lead to excesses and deficiencies. people that go vegan without taking care as they start out are prone to problems because they're eating in a way that isn't habitual for them and they might not have any guidance.

additionally, most of the health problems that are widespread in the west pretty much go unnoted because they're ""normal"". high cholesterol, high bp, GI issues from almost never eating enough fiber...people don't care about that if you eat 'normal' food. once you go vegan, everyone has their eyes peeled and is ready to blame your lack of animal products for so much as a headache.

> Did no one ever teach you the nutrition plate? It’s only having an impact on the environment because people (especially in the US) don’t care about their health and eat way too much meat. I’m saying a balanced diet is more healthier than eating too much of one thing. 

you can't really eat too many plants unless you're eating processed food.

> Also, veggies don’t have as much protein so where do you get protein? (It’s bad for you to eat too much beans too, mostly for the digestive system) Most people I know who have become vegans have low immune systems, and eat lots of sugar. They eat sugar because there is little balance in their diet and they need energy. They are held back by their vegan diet and eat more sugars than fats, which is higher in calorie content, which in most cases, actually makes a person fatter. It may taste the same, but the nutrition content is way different and way less healthier because it is lacking certain nutrients that are vital to your body’s survival. My mother is a dietician so my information on this is scientifically proven.


From all of this, i actually don't know if you're trolling or not, but none of it's ""scientifically proven"" lol.

this is what actual dieticians think about veganism/vegetarianism:

Cheryl A. Wall, an author and longtime Rutgers University professor who helped elevate Zora Neale Hurston and other black women into English literature curriculums, died on April 4 at her home in Highland Park, N.J. She was 71.

The cause was complications of an asthma attack, her daughter, Camara Epps, said.

In a teaching career of nearly five decades, Dr. Wall championed racial diversity both in the curriculum and the classroom. She encouraged more black students to major in English and pursue postgraduate degrees. And she widened the scope of literary scholarship to include black novelists, poets and nonfiction authors as well as essayists, whom she considered central to the black literary tradition.

“From its earliest iteration, the African American essay endorsed the democratic ideals the nation professed, while condemning its failure to fulfill them,” Dr. Wall wrote in “On Freedom and the Will to Adorn: The Art of the African American Essay” (2018).

She contrasted W.E.B. Du Bois’s self-conscious vision of blackness with Hurston’s bravado — “that when she is discriminated against, she feels ‘merely’ astonished that anyone can deny themselves ‘the pleasure of my company.’”

Prof. Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of Harvard University’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, described Dr. Wall in an email as “a leading, pioneering scholar of African American women’s literature.”

“Her scholarly work,” he said, “was characterized by the careful, meticulous attention to detail of a great literary historian and the exquisite mastery of form that marks the work of our best literary critics — a combination all too rare among scholars of American literature today.”

Dr. Wall was scheduled to retire from Rutgers next month. A symposium celebrating her legacy, organized by a colleague, Prof. Evie Shockley, had been planned for last week, but was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

“In a period when black women writers were publishing, being recovered and receiving national attention in greater numbers than ever before,” Professor Shockley said, “Cheryl found it possible to make a 45-year career of helping to ensure that these writers and their writings are valued in all of their power, genius and complexity.”

Dr. Wall was one of the first black women to head an English department at a major research university. Under her leadership, Rutgers required all English majors to complete a course in African-American literature.

She was a founder of the Rutgers English Diversity Institute, which encouraged greater diversity among graduate students in English; the founding chairwoman of the Crossroads Theater Company in New Jersey; and a leader of the university’s Institute for Women’s Leadership, to encourage diversity in higher education.

Her other books include: “Changing Our Own Words: Criticism, Theory, and Writing by Black Women” (1989); “Women of the Harlem Renaissance” (1995); and “Worrying the Line: Black Women Writers, Lineage, and Literary Tradition” (2005).

Dr. Wall also edited two volumes of Hurston’s works for the Library of America — “Novels and Short Stories” (1995) and “Folklore, Memoirs and Other Writings” (1995) — and two volumes of criticism on Hurston’s fiction: “‘Sweat’: Texts and Contexts” (1997) and “Their Eyes Were Watching God: A Casebook” (2000).

Her scholarship went beyond the Harlem Renaissance and included contemporary black authors like Toni Morrison, Gloria Naylor, Lucille Clifton and Toni Cade Bambara.

“Cheryl Wall took pains to put black literature in conversation with other academic disciplines and to bring it before churches and community groups,” said Paula J. Giddings, emerita professor of Africana studies at Smith College in Massachusetts.

Cheryl Ann Wall was born on Oct. 29, 1948, in Manhattan to the Rev. Monroe Wall, a pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Harlem, and Rennie Ray (Strayhorn) Wall, an English teacher for the New York City public schools.

“Cheryl grew up around books and literature, read all the time as a child,” her sister, Gatsie Wall-Jones, said. “She was clearly influenced by her mother and developed the same passion to share knowledge, particularly through reading.”

Raised in Jamaica, Queens, she graduated from the Rhodes Preparatory School in Manhattan. She studied piano under the composer and performer Margaret Bonds. She earned a bachelor’s degree in English from Howard University in Washington and a doctorate at Harvard on a Ford Foundation scholarship.

Dr. Wall began teaching at Rutgers in 1972. She was named the Board of Governors Zora Neale Hurston professor in 2007.

Her marriage to C. Roy Epps in 1979 ended in divorce. Her daughter and sister are her only immediate survivors.

actuallesbians,fobeal1,t3_g6m4c5,1587658923.0,"i experienced this for a long time, yeah. i believe i used to think i was bi because religion is a hell of a comphet drug, on top of society’s pressures. 

but here’s what i actually wanted to say:

“comphet” in the lesbian/lgbt community and the compulaory heterosexuality adrienne rich wrote about are now two slightly different terms. she wrote that it actually does affect all women, not just queer women. for example, women being expected to wear makeup in professional settings where their attractiveness shouldn’t really matter (keep in mind she was writing decades ago). or how if you’re a woman you are probably going to be expected to say, organize or clean up or prepare food for a get together over a man.

i see a lot of people explaining it as something that is just for queer people that didn’t know/understand themselves due to oppressive heteronormativity. i guess the meaning has evolved, but that’s not all it meant originally.

Andrès and EWR-MIA. i’m a little wary—anyone know how this compares? i just feel like i don’t taste much. they’re not bad, just wish they were more flavorful, especially since they seem so interesting on the can.

i enjoyed Lagom though."

i feel like a lot of the compound words are arbitrarily accepted/denied, but i'm also generally bad at them so far"
