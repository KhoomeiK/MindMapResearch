bipolar,fqlntnf,t3_gjichm,1589462539.0,"I made what I thought were lifelong friends in college. At one point I opened up to one of them and he wasn't understanding at all. He was the opposite, he told me to snap out of it, to stop being weak,etc. He wasn't just a drinking buddy but also one of my best friends.

About 10, 15 years later, after so much life hit us both, he called me up out of the blue and apologized. He had a panic attack at work and thought he was dying and had to start taking meds. Finally he got it and realized that he had been a huge prick.

bipolar,fqghyag,t3_giqnb2,1589346745.0,"For me it depends. Hypomania vs. mania vs mixed state. 

I'm absolutely going to put a trigger warning on this answer, ya'll. Just saying. 

Hypomanic is my favorite and I won't lie about that. If it's not a bad time I can really get a lot done, I feel good, I don't need a lot of sleep, I feel amazing, sociable, I feel like I can do anything but not deluded, no urges to go and start projects or shop or anything. I also used to travel a lot when I was unmedicated, I would pack up and go and didn't care who or what I was leaving behind. I'd sell all of my belongings, and just GO. This was.. maybe Manic and not hypo. 

Manic: at it's worst I've spent over $700 on an app game over the course of .. I can't remember how long. I told someone I trust and he helped me get a handle on it (and that episode) and uninstall it. 

Another manic episode: I hit a bird and the smell of the blood made me think that perhaps it needed me to go back and bury it and perform burial rituals with it's blood. 

Mixed state is dangerous. I become very self destructive, very aggitated, and very quick to self injure, or want to self injure. I don't do that anymore, or if I get to the point where I need to and I don't have my other outlets available, I will grab an ice cube and hold onto it until it hurts my hand too much for me to hold onto it. No permanent injury. It does the job. I will be pretty unable to function, I will be nearly unable to work, and it's at this stage that I feel the most need to.. I am unsure how to describe it. There is always this restlessness inside everywhere that can't get out. Instead of ending up in creative outlets or euphoria it ends up going internal and I'm frozen in place and I take it out on myself in awful fits of crying and the need to die. These don't happen often."

PublicFreakout,fo8yrcg,t1_fo8hqay,1587606699.0,"I do understand what you're trying to say. And I agree with you. The ""think for yourself"" part is something I agree with. 

The issue here is that I agree that the park should be closed. Many governments, however, have allowed public areas to remain open for the sake of the public because of exactly what this woman has said: they have paid for it, paid their taxes and many adults can utilize them for the sake of exercise and the like. I live in a state that allows it, and the beaches and stuff are ""patrolled"" they say, to make sure no one congregates. 

Do I think these parents were right or smart? Absolutely not. Can you tresspass in a public park? You absolutely can, even when there is no pandemic. There are hours of operation, and certain parks close. Now, when a state of emergency is declared, laws can be passed and city ordinances can be declared that are different than normal laws.

The reality of the situation is, though, exactly what you saw here. That's why it's important to be able to see the reason behind it. My state is not run by smart people, one is a man that got his position through voter suppression and then pretended not to know that covid-19 could be spread if it asymptomatic. Another is guilty of insider trading. We are in the middle of reopening so many businesses as early as next week because I'm pretty certain our leaders think everything is A-OK. So it's really important that we all think for ourselves, just like you said. What that MEANS, though, is that we stay aware of what I've been saying: 

Playgrounds are not safe. Larger areas of parks are, if you remain distant enough from other park patrons. And good parenting skills go a long way. I don't know what kind of kids you've been around but the kids I'm around listen to me. 

Common sense is important: being in a park is ok, but if there are a ton of people there with tons of kids that are going to be running around and tempting your kid to play then obviously, don't go to that particular park. I mean, it's not hard.

The point is this, and I want to say this before continuing. Thank you for calming the f- down and having a legit talk with me, because as you can see, while we may not always see eye to eye, it's better than getting all aggro. It's also going to get a better response from people, so thank you. But the point it: This entire situation is going to be doing a lot of really fucked up things to kids. It's going to leave a lasting impression on them. Being cooped up inside all the time, having them think they won't see their friends ever again, not getting any sun. It's going to breed a generation of agoraphobes and germaphobes and I'm concerned. So letting them out into the fresh air is so so so important. It's just really important to be smart about it, and not to go to a playground where they can put their hands all over gross germy places. It's never black and white."
PublicFreakout,fo8esio,t1_fo85t1b,1587595178.0,"They didn't just arrest her for letting her kids play on the playground. They gave her the option of leaving. Several times over. If you notice, they didn't arrest anyone else for letting their kids play there. The interesting thing about most police is that they don't have to follow the letter of the law, and most of the time, if you cooperate in situations like this, they will let people go without being arrested. So that's the key here, and it's important that you recognize that.

Were these parents breaking the local laws? Absolutely. She in particular was arrested because she was being told by the police to leave, by the park employee to leave, and the police gave the park employee the option to charge her with trespassing because the playground was closed and they all chose to break that ordinance. No one was going to be arrested until she pushed. That's the stupid part about all of this, and what makes all of it so ridiculous. They believe they're making some sort of statement, when in reality they look so dumb. The cops were going to let them go! Then they practically begged to be arrested. And it was all in the name of some sort of protest. 

You have made a lot of vocal accusations and have called out a lot of people. I'm not going to bother to link you to the article, but it's been discovered that she's part of a group in Idaho that organizes protests. So she's put her children in danger for the sake of her own political ideology. Whatever ideas you have about whether or not the park should be closed doesn't matter. She was going to push until she was arrested, no matter what. It was part of the plan, I can almost guarantee it, because then only portions of it could be tweeted out to show how bad THE MAN is for stopping us poor people from enjoying the fresh air. It's all manipulation and idiocy. And you fell into her trap. Congrats."

PublicFreakout,fo821ce,t1_fo7y9mj,1587588508.0,"Okay, I'm gonna try this. So listen carefully. 

People are allowed to go outside and get fresh air and like... go jogging and get sun. The order isn't to become a hermit. 

The order is to stay away from people. To stay distanced. 

Going to a park isn't inherently dangerous and it doesn't say 'GATHER AROUND PEOPLE OMG'. You can take your kids to a park, if you're smart, and allow them to play with each other but not other kids, if you've taught them well enough. And if you are a smart enough parent. That means that kids and people ARE NOT in contact with one another. The grass and space is enough for everyone. 

The playground being closed is that way because it means that people will not congregate. It means, or it SHOULD have meant, that people will stay away from each other. The children can play amongst their own groups instead of right next to each other on swings or a slide or whatever. But no, the moms decided that they would ignore that order. 

So yes. It was cool for kids to play anywhere else, because it's possible to play outside and away from others. That's what social distancing is. It's not airborne enough that it will float like 50 feet and fly into your mouth. So please, please, use common sense."

AmericanHorrorStory,fo57d59,t1_fjf1t5j,1587519103.0,"I just binged the fuck out of 1984 and I loved it, and I know I'm late to the party answering some of these, but! I think I can try. 

> Why didn’t any of the 1948 victims that Lavinia killed ever show up as ghosts?

From what I caught, when the explanation of the 'curse' was brought up by Jingles, he said that he thought it was brought on by the death of Lavinia, and the creation of her angry spirit, for lack of a better word. When he killed her, the curse was created. Since the others in 1948 died before her, they wouldn't be trapped there. 

>Since Jonas died on the road outside of camp and returned as a ghost, why didn’t Doc Hopple also return since that’s where she was killed too?


I was confused by this too, since Ray also died by beheading on the road outside of that sign and still ended up trapped. Part of me wonders if it was an intentional continuity error because there were so many of them in 80's horror but I also don't have my hopes set so high. 

>Why were all of Jingles’ victims pissed at Margaret? Conversely why were Margaret’s victims mad at Jingles? Why were ANY of them vengeful towards Richard?

Timeline is fuzzy for me, but I do know that there was a lot of discussion that was hinted at. Jingles plead his case with a lot of the ghosts about his son. Quite a few of them knew about Margaret being the real bad guy. Jingles had told them that Richard was after his boy. All of that being said, Montana said she had a change of heart when Brooke helped Trevor over the property line, and then there was a consensus among the ghosts that they would all get along and work together as a community. Maybe that explains some of why they were all sorta on the same pages about who to and not to feel things about.

>Since it turned out that Lavinia tricked Margaret into killing the 1970 group, why didn’t Jingles rat her out and exonerate Margaret to her victims?

This one was pretty easy for me to answer in my head, whether or not it's correct or canon. Margaret is a piece of shit even if she was manipulated, and was important to Benji for a short amount of time comparatively. That vs. mom - especially since it appeared that he still held his mom in such high regard, and she still had such an emotional hold on him? There was no way he'd sell mom out for a woman like Margaret. 

The other stuff I think was probably just not addressed due to time issues but I wondered the same stuff. 

Sorry for the length but I'd been wondering the same things! It was fun to think on."

The Old Testament text did come from the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew Bible is not translated into English, some of it is in Aramaic. The first five books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuterotomy) are the Torah and were written by Moses (with the exception of the telling of his death at the end of the last). 

These books are a mix of law for the Israelites, historical tales, record keeping for families. To help guide. It should also be noted that around the same time the New Testament was being made canon, texts of the Talmud were circulating - though the Talmud (which is a collection of teachings, ethics, customs, etc) had likely largely been verbally passed on for generations. 

The New Testament does try to replace a lot of what the OT was about with love and kindness instead of rules and laws. That was partly why Jesus was killed - and this part is coming from historians of the time and from the gospels themselves. He was a political threat, and a threat to the ways that had been around for a very long time. The Romans and the churches wanted him dead, because he was disrupting the status quo in a big way."

This is one of the reasons why depression is such a monster. So many people have it and don't show it because they recognize that some people won't be able to handle the negativity. The key here is to find people that will hang around without your mask on, but for you to also respect that too much negativity can be exhausting. Even your closest people can need a breather and that's OK. It's human.

The little things pile up so quickly and it's so difficult, and I know exactly what you mean. I wish there was an easy answer, and there isn't. You're in the same situation I am and it's so frustrating because I feel it. 

You're a lot like me too, I used to really deep deep clean when I was on stims (which I stopped using because I wanted to better myself) but my house got worse after. I didn't have the outside help to push me to stay up all  night cleaning. It's BETTER for me and I remind myself of that. 

In the end, try to remind yourself that you're doing what you can. Especially if you have kids! Having a perfectly clean house with kids is a fantasy sold to use by television and I think we beat ourselves up too much for it, because children are little tornadoes that tear everything apart and test our sanity every day. When they're old enough to help you clean, it'll be awesome!"
AskReddit,fhpix1i,t1_fhb7k4r,1581790572.0,OH Jesus fuck I hate this one so much. Yes.
bipolar,fhpilba,t3_f4buez,1581790397.0,"I understand you perfectly and my house is the same way. THE SAME WAY. And I used to love cleaning but I've recently had surgery so I can't do it. So... I isolate myself away from everything so they can destroy the rest of the house and I can't see it. 

I don't know if it's an option for you to talk to your wife about how you feel. Just asking her to throw things away instead of leaving them out. If you're like me, you're afraid of the conflict it may cause, but it may be worth it.  Having a serious discussion about how to work together to make sure everything is done. 

Working together to get it clean and then KEEPING it clean together is also an option. It's easier to keep a space clean than to get it there once it's gotten so far. But you'll need her help getting it there, and she'll need to know that. 

I don't know enough about your situation to know if you can speak to her about it, but know that you're not alone. I understand the anxiety and i too get overwhelmed. There are too many things. In that case, what always helped me, was focusing on getting just one thing done a day. If you need to tidy up (like throwing away trash) that's one thing. But then pick a -thing- to do, do some of it, then put it behind you for the time being. 

I know I'm saying a lot, but I feel your situation so much, and I want to help. A couple other things:

Eventually, you'll reach a point during the day when you can't do anything about it that day. Remind yourself of it. Try to allow yourself to let it go just for that time. That's helped me SO MUCH. I tell myself ""there's nothing I can do about it this second, so let's just forget about it"". And I try to focus on other things that I CAN fix. I distract myself. Because then I know that I can focus on that thing again when I can actually do something. 

Finally: about what to throw away. I know this doesn't always work for people, but I have a general rule. If I haven't touched something for a year, unless it has sentimental value, it gets tossed. I haven't missed it for a year, I haven't used it, so why am I keeping it? This doesn't really apply to things like pictures or whatever. But if you don't have room for stuff, then downsizing feels AMAZING. This may not work for you, but I wanted to give you some idea of how to start, in case it would help. 

I'm so sorry for babbling, but I just read so much of myself in your situation. Best of luck to you friend."

Do what you have to. And if you do that, find a good law firm that will work for you to get it. There are firms that will help you get disability and will only take payment after you start getting benefits. Best of luck to you."

I have a good job, and a life, and stuff I don't want to fuck up by being trapped in a facility that won't help me. I'm as stable as I'm gonna get. I'm functional, with some weird thoughts. So I keep those to myself, especially when hypomanic (which is all the time nearly and can't be medicated away, we've tried), and share it with the person that I know will help it get out of my head."

I rarely call people out like this on this site but to say that I (or anyone) have to base my self worth on my weight is why I (and many people) end up with eating disorders and starving ourselves. I struggled with starving and purging literally everything I ate no matter how small because I was overweight most of my youth. I have dealt with eating disorders for over 20 years now because of opinions like yours. 

I get the basic concept. Love yourself. Take care of your body. But that's just the thing. I DIDN'T take care of myself until I learned to love myself. And that's how it works with most people. Positive change doesnt come from self loathing. 

You can love the person you are while wanting to change the physical composition of your body.
