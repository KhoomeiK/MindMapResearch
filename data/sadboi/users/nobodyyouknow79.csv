BPD,f7d37zy,t3_dvioh2,1573606447.0,Perfect description of the endless cycle that is BPD. Know that you're not alone. I'm grateful to everyone who posts and shares their experience here.
BPD,f6j3c1n,t3_drjo1o,1572888515.0,"I hope you won't end your life. I've been there in my 20's, and it was hard trying to navigate life, and not having a name for my disorder. I've contemplated suicide many times when I was younger. But, as I learned about BPD, and accepted/loved myself  completely life became more enjoyable. Also, finding the right medication and researching BPD helped tremendously. I can't afford therapy, so YouTube videos helped a lot, as well as seeking out others who've dealt with this."
