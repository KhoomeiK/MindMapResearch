Agoraphobia,foo4agz,t3_g49wld,1587932218.0,"Dare by Barry McDonagh. I bought the audio book on Audible and used to listen to it while I walked around attempting exposure. Full disclosure I still suffer a fair amount of agoraphobia, and should probably listen to it again, but I think at the time it really helped. Some of the lessons have stayed with me but annoyingly, like most things, it takes continuing practise. 
Also he has a soothing Irish accent which helps as company in your ears even on face value :)"
Anxiety,foo23zv,t3_g8g3pb,1587930997.0,"I heard crying releases bottled up emotion physically, and that if you don't that shit calcifies and stays in you forever until you release it. I find it hard to cry because it makes me feel self-conscious, like what if someone hears me. And that it must mean I'm a mess. Truth is, you're a mess regardless. You're actually likely to be more of a mess if you don't because that bottled up emotion will give you emotional problems in other ways, and for longer. 

Just think of that old guy in the wheel chair in The Big Lebowski - 'Strong men also cry...' wawawawawaa"
Anxiety,foo1ivf,t1_folgqub,1587930665.0,OMG the gas!! It took me forever to realise that gas can give you intense or sharp pains that make your anxiety think of heart attacks. It was that scene from The Last King of Scotland where James McAvoy  has to squeeze the fart out the king with a baseball bat.
mentalhealth,fonz2mo,t3_g8ak4w,1587929300.0,"I'm in love with my best friend, except not really. Platonic in all our history even though we hold hands, cuddle up on movie nights and stay together sometimes. She's the best person in my life and I've never loved anyone in a relationship as much as I do her. 

It's become mildly confusing to me recently because I think I actually am attracted to her too, and sometimes when we're very close I can imagine taking the next step. The thought of it is exciting. However, I don't think that would be clever because I'm not sure my love would convert into a sexual relationship in which I love her any more in or in a different way than I do now - and that is not in a way that makes me think of marriage, babies or settling down etc - ie, a relationship. 

So, though it can sometimes feel intimate to the point of wanting even a little bit more, I know that that's all it is - passing, and a little bit. And so I let it go, acknowledge things can be complicated and cross varying points on the spectrum, but that ultimately she is a friend and if we didn't keep it in our pants we could very easily spoil the greatness of that friendship."

Every country has plenty to see and experience. Except maybe Kazakhstan, which looks dryyyy. If I lived there I'd say no"
