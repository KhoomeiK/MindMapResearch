Angelina is badass and all your reactions make it VERY apparent that she is underrated.

He's not perfect, sometimes the things he does cause me to feel worse, but me not saying anything is really what made it awful. When I broke I was honest, I had nothing else to turn to other than raw honesty of how much I hurt, how empty I felt. There were lots of tears and hiding behind a blanket, but he sat with me, held me, and told me all the advice that I give others, but have never believed about myself. He gave me back what I always have to others and it's the only time anyone has done that. 

It's hard
But from rock bottom there's only one way you can go. And that way is up.
I believe in you.
It's okay to not be okay sometimes. It really is. It isn't because anything you've done or haven't done. Sometimes it just sucks, and you need time. Support from where you can get it, whatever form that may come in. 
I found the person who helped me when I least expected it, and when I was actively NOT looking. He encouraged me to get professional help. And I've only gotten better and more aware, even if times are still bad occasionally. But it's okay.

Perhaps look into the scar Band-Aids the other person mentioned. My sister-in-law has a scar gel that she puts on every day for some really bad road rash a couple years back and she swears by it. I'll see if I can get the brand name from her later.

try to encourage healing from the inside out by keeping the area moist (like with Neosporin or somethibg similar) and covered with bandages for as long as you can if you relapse. My dad has also had some nasty cuts and scars on his fingers and that's the advice he gave me which has been very helpful with every wound I've had since. 

I don't have much advice for after the scar has already formed though, sorry. It may take many years but from my experience the scar tissue slowly blends in more with the skin around it. But genetics also play a role so ymmv."

And until this point I had avoided Homestuck in its entirety on Reddit. Rip. 


I'm glad you find joy in this image though, op. The base happiness and wonder from that series deserves to live on, even if you never actually read it."
3Dprinting,f13igj2,t3_d7j5yn,1569160840.0,Absolutely amazing. Honestly it's the modern version of marble sculpture! Gives me the same feeling of awe and wonder.  beautiful.
ShittyVeganFoodPorn,f0z5igc,t3_d7axzy,1569086899.0,It's really not that weird. I ate an English muffin with salsa and nooch on it for breakfast cause I didn't have tortillas lol.
vegetarian,f0z53km,t3_d7b26v,1569086608.0,Honestly same. Also had to cut out eggs. Turns out I'm intolerant //: apparently when I was little I would ask my uncle why my sister was always okay when I always felt so sick. It was the eggs.
DnD,f0yt8bu,t3_d78v7e,1569077837.0,I love her little horn nubs <33
whatsthisplant,f0xmcdo,t3_d71863,1569037504.0,"We had a different kind of Jasmine bush in our yard growing up, and it is still my favorite scent (and tea) to this day. Sadly it doesn't do too well where I live now and my cats won't let me have indoor plants 😭"
curlyhair,f0vjt8x,t3_d6oq8j,1568983958.0,Welp. You've convinced me to cut my hair again. My hair curls similarly at a similar length but I haven't done cg with short hair! Absolutely gorgeous and your curls frame your face so well! Amazing results for just starting~
BigCatGifs,f0rznko,t1_f0qy7s3,1568896114.0,My aunt used to have a turtle... Then she adopted a new puppy. That poor turtle survived so long with a messed up shell. You could see it's lungs. It was tragic.
WitchesVsPatriarchy,f0odzue,t1_f0oaz2z,1568808049.0,"Thank you <33 I am actually married to a wonderful man who constantly tells me I'm beautiful/gorgeous/pretty. 

I just still get real messed up when I think about how few the number of people who have said those kinds of things are which is ridiculous. But I still feel it sometimes. Like I know I'm not very conventionally attractive or even very feminine and I spent my high school years very androgenous/masculine so the window has been shorter but yeah. Brains can be real dumb sometimes."
gaming,f0nv7k5,t3_d5r89g,1568782005.0,"Hot damn! He's finished more LoZ games than me! Go buddy go! 

I always get stuck at some random puzzle and not even the internet can get me out of it //:"
BitLifeApp,f0ns9w3,t3_d5lbd5,1568779049.0,And it'll be another year after before I get the update on Android 👌
WitchesVsPatriarchy,f0nqrwg,t1_f0msjhe,1568777661.0,"The only time I was ever catcalled I was 20 and I swear the kid was on a middle school field trip to my university's campus. 

The fact that some gross ass kid is the only person who's ever done that really fucks me up. The whole situation is fucked up and I hate it and it feels me with such RAGE at the patriarchy and at sexism and misogeny. 

I wish there was a physical thing I could break or burn that would make a difference but alas. All this energy just goes into angrily doodling on paper and putting just female villagers in my animal crossing game and shit like that. Also comments on Reddit posts I guess lolol."
CompulsiveSkinPicking,f0m290u,t3_d56na5,1568735092.0,"Maybe having a date set will help me... I just don't know if I have anything that would motivate me enough though )): not many exciting things coming up in my life, been taking it one day at a time lately so I don't have any future plans //: 

Maybe my first wedding anniversary? But that's coming up soon and I haven't even gone a whole day without picking yet so that's a really difficult one. Ahh. 

I'm definitely gonna bring this up with my therapist during my next appt though. See if she can help me pinpoint something ((: I hadn't really thought of setting up a date before, so thank you all for the idea and motivation!"
depression,f0m0vy1,t3_d5eg6v,1568734185.0,The other day I was in a really bad place. Broke down at work. Sobbed alone in one of the vacant clean rooms (I work at a hotel). Texted my husband. The first chance he got he called me and didn't try to fix it. Just gave me words of love and care and asked me gentle and distracting questions without invalidating the way I felt. Was exactly what I needed in that moment. Honestly didn't have that kind of support before him. And I will never take him for granted <33
blackcats,f0lzlev,t1_f0kzlox,1568733322.0,"I wish I could do that. I don't have the financial means to let old kitties live out their lives in love and peace right now, but as soon as I do I hope to do the same as your nephew ((:"
depression,f0lxpdc,t3_d5d5lq,1568732055.0,Every single one of my therapists have also struggled with mental health. That's why they wanted to get into the field: so others wouldn't suffer like they did/do. You're not a hypocrite. But it's also definitely okay to have your own therapist when you are one! Everyone needs a little help now and then and there is NO shame in that.
ZeroWaste,f0lwz2t,t1_f0llypn,1568731565.0,Bro they're not a native speaker and they've said it multiple times. I feel like titlegore only works if the person is a native speaker. Otherwise you just look like a dick.
roosterteeth,f0ljybg,t1_f0kueyl,1568720968.0,I didn't realize she's my age! I always assume public figures are at least 5 years older than me. I'm so happy she's out there living her best life.
lgbt,f0ljjrt,t3_d5c2px,1568720548.0,"One of my friend just ""chopped off [his] titties"" (his words) and a fun little party seems so appropriate for such an awesome thing that he's been waiting so long for <33 I love this idea."
