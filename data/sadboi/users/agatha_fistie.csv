4PanelCringe,fmnwc11,t3_fw7b8q,1586237206.0,"Probably worth mentioning that the choir teacher doesn’t even choose who gets the melody. Choral directors can choose which songs are performed and take artistic liberties within what is written in the score, but that’s really about it. The parts are already written in. In this genre of beginner choral music melodies will nearly always go to the soprano, so all this novice meme maker has done is show her inexperience in choral singing, lack of knowledge about how a choir works, and poor meme craftsmanship skill. And she spelled “tenor” wrong."

BPD,fjt5so6,t1_fjt4w1q,1583604407.0,"In the US I’m pretty sure if you express suicidal intent they’re required to hospitalize you? Will read further HIPPA/contract details and get back to you. But that’s what I’ve been told by others when I was in the hospital, and when I told my psychiatrist I was suicidal she told me I needed to go. However, they needed my consent first, and I think it’s because with my psychiatrist I didn’t have a contract like I did with my therapist. Perhaps it is one of the tenants of a client/therapist contract that is pretty universal: after all, if your client is suicidal there’s very little you can do for them with an hour of time per week?"
BPD,fjt4xp3,t1_fjt33uf,1583604127.0,"Fuck, I get so triggered by this. There’s such a stigma against mental illness, a bigger one against personality disorders, and a huge one against BPD. One time my cousin was explaining his divorce and said “she was a borderline” like that explained everything and I almost blew up. We’re backed into a corner by these stigmas, and when we display symptoms typical of the disorder, we’re labeled as crazy, which only makes it worse. Fuck them, lol."
BPD,fjt4j8l,t1_fjsrm3r,1583603872.0,"Pretty common, I feel. Pain is so addictive when you feel like you need to suffer. I find it provides an equilibrium, without which I wouldn’t be able to survive. 
Sometimes a familiar pain is more comfortable than an unfamiliar pleasure, I think."
BPD,fjt4bve,t1_fjpic12,1583603741.0,"Yes. I always feel like i need to lie to my therapist so I won’t get hospitalized, and because of it, I come off as very functional because of how well I can hide it. All you can do is try different therapists and be as honest as possible, I think. 
Best of luck, mate."
BPD,fjt3yn8,t3_fegxgc,1583603626.0,"DAE think about a mistake they’ve made in the past and want to absolutely self destruct?
Like even if I’ve already punished myself for it, or reconciled, or been forgiven, or even if no one cared in the first place, I’ll remember something stupid I’ve done and want to slam my head into a brick wall. 
It doesn’t even matter how long ago it was. I don’t remember much from my childhood but sometimes the memory of some silly mistake from middle school slips through and it sends me into a day-ruining spiral. 
Who else experiences this? I know I’m messed up, but is this extra messed up? Any suggestions on how to deal with this?"

BPD,fjiehzn,t1_fjgdk1y,1583365886.0,"omg! yes!! unless you’re not holding yourself accountable, i don’t think it’s “avoiding responsibility”. i think it’s you wanting to grow and become a better person after making mistakes in your past. i always think “oh, that was old MK, new MK wouldn’t do the same thing” and then i make another mistake and end up wanting to punish myself and start over. ah, fresh starts. if only."

I feel so uncomfortable making eye contact with people, especially people in authority or people I don’t know. I feel like I don’t know what’s appropriate in societal terms. Am I just weird? DAE struggle with this?"
