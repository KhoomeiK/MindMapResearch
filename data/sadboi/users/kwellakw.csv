I hope you know that everything is going to be okay and to remember to take deep breaths. Leading up today you know that mental illness really sucks. You have been put into hospitals in the past because of school and PTSD from home. You’re a survivor, don’t forget that, and you have so much to lose(friends and family). Please, don’t give up. Please, please, please don’t give in. I’m suffering now, I’ll do my best to keep us moving forward. I’ll do my best to pick up good habits. So that you don’t need to suffer as much due to my actions. Smile future me. :) 

Love,

depression,f1tlgs6,t3_dara30,1569746139.0,"It’s great to see I’m not the only one with this thought process. I’m struggling with my self-esteem In trying to be perfect in other people’s perspectives of me. For example, I’ll comment on a post in the beginning of using Reddit(almost a year ago) and sometimes I’ll see it downvoted. “Why did this get downvoted? I didn’t type or offend some one didn’t I?”. Then after a few moments of trying to figure out why I see the blue negative one number for so long I think to myself, “I’m going to delete it because it’ll show on my profile and others will see how stupid the comment was, or downvote it even more!”I did it and would be afraid to ever post or comment on anything because I’ll imagine only seeing negatives instead of positives. I comment on your post now because I feel that coming together and sharing our experiences can help ourselves to get some closure of our problems(even if they are different because you and I have our own unique personality). This comment may be downvoted or upvoted, depending on how helpful it is or not. Overall, just know that this post you made is bringing all of us together(the positive numbers you’re getting!) and that you aren’t alone. Plus, try to remember to come back to this post to help you know one downvote isn’t going to stop you from keep moving forward(when you have us to help you!).  :)

Update edit: hey I’m back from viewing my recent comments on another post(not this one) and it got downvoted. I said something hopefully positive enough for the OP but then I looked back to the recently added comments too, I found something interesting. Each recent comment is downvoted on that post. I’m assuming one person went on a raid of downvotes, probably just venting in their own way. Overall, I updated this comment because I wanted to show you that downvotes are sometimes spammed because someone isn’t in the goodness of moods at the moment. Honestly I can see myself doing a downvote raid, because I can get impulsive when I’m vulnerable and tend to exploit my anger or sadness to someone else to make them feel bad too(I’m managing myself better now). OP we got your back and don’t believe your in the wrong, your voice is as important as the next person and so on. :)"
depression,f1thndo,t1_f1te3gh,1569744448.0,"I’ve stepped back from Reddit for awhile because the stuff in some subreddits were a bit much for me. Now I feel better, knowing that I shouldn’t take things so seriously(validation on something)that aren’t my friends or family I trust to give reasonable feedback. Overall, to be honest, I do get a bit sad if I get downvoted but I got to remember how Reddit works and to keep moving forward."
