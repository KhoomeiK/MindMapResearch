I was previously a Political Science student and transferred to NYU because I wanted to get into a Nutrition & Dietetics program and NYU just happened to take the most of my credits compared to all of the other schools I applied to. **I do not regret transferring to NYU at all.** However, if I had not transferred because of the program, I would regret it **a lot**. I liked my old university which was an arguably more prestigious school, I missed my old friends, and of course it was hard to live in a new country (even though I'm only Canadian). It's also just really hard to form a bond with students as a transfer student versus starting at a college and graduating from the same college. My first year, I was very depressed and it took me a full year to find a good set of friends. My point is, **it is hard** to make friends at NYU as a transfer student and that's coming from a pretty social person. You have to put the effort in more than some other schools, especially if you're at a state school right now. I would not transfer just for the school.

The first month that I got the kyleena I started getting monthly yeast infections and occasional episodes of BV. I took it out back in April due to that (and also suspecting that it was causing hair loss). Since then, the amount of yeast infections/BV I get has significantly reduced. But I still get a yeast infection every few months and BV once or twice a year.
