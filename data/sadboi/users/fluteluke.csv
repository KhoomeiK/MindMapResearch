However, after not living in the same state for several years, we were both at our parents' for game night one time around the holidays. I got hot (we were drinking and our parents keep the place at like 80 degrees), so I changed into pj pants and a bralette (not transparent or anything, basically like wearing a lacy crop-top). Sister freaks out and insists that I can't wear that because it's basically like ""wearing just a bra""! Here's the wrinkle: my husband and sister's fiancee were both there, too, which I guess just have complicated things in her mind? People can be weird and possessive (esp when drinking)"

Remember that work is not everything, and it's more important for you to tend to your mental health. Please also don't hesitate to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if you don't feel like you have anyone to talk to and/or if you just need to vent and talk to someone.

I won't say I'm cured, but I am so thankful that I have kept going this long because the hard work of therapy has been so worth it for me. Please go get yourself some help - there are great online sources of therapy, doctors who can talk to you about antidepressants, and groups where you can talk things out without judgment. It's amazing how much talking things through can help you process some of these thoughts and untie some of the tangled-up spirals you've got going on. This is an illness and not your fault, and this feeling will not be forever! I promise that there are people out here who understand you and want to help.

Step-parents already have a really hard time; OP is well-intentioned and trying to prevent issues, because OP may have experienced something like this firsthand. It's not OP's fault they are trying to help the girls' relationship, and if OP and partner can't communicate about it, that is not a fair partnership. I agree that OP shouldn't just make a blanket rule, especially since their role doesn't seem strong in this household, but that doesn't mean their feelings are not valid!"
AmItheAsshole,flk21t1,t1_flk0vw7,1585232253.0,"ESH - Respectfully, though, it seems like OP isn't in a position to make that call. I would try instituting a rule in the house about language or something? ""Banning"" them seeing each other isn't going to work if your partner isn't on board with it. But OP's feelings are valid and it's hurtful of everyone to ignore them; partner's response to it undermines OP's role as a mother figure and this would keep the ban from being taken seriously. OP and partner need to have serious conversations about this. It sounds like partner is encouraging the ""boys will be boys"" platitude (yes, they are girls, but I think it is still a dangerous mindset; probably partner thinks it's cute and harmless because they are girls acting like boys often do with each other - and it absolutely might be if that's how they were raised). Present a unified front so that your feelings are heard, but you can't just impose your will on a household if no one else believes there's a problem. That's what leads to issues and falling-outs."
DMAcademy,flh7efb,t3_fou6oz,1585157453.0,"I would start by having a zero session and talking about your play style. You, as the DM, want to play an immersive storytelling game that everyone collaborates to progress. It sounds like at least that one person is playing more like min/maxing in a competitive game.  That might just be something you each have your own style on. However, make it known that you would prefer your scenario to run within an agreed set of parameters. You can always throw in some cool hidden loot to satisfy that player's desire to collect and accumulate powerful weapons, but introduce lots of NPC's that they have to communicate with in order to get their objectives/quests.

Part of it sounds like your friends aren't in it together as a party, but are playing individually/competitively, so they don't listen when it's not their ""turn."" My campaign had to figure out how to be more democratic in our party decisions because some of the more assertive players would make decisions, even if it was ""the way their character would play"" which made the game really frustrating for a wallflower like me. We had an out-of-game chat about it and it really helped the others realize they'd been steamrolling me without knowing it.

Also, inspiration bonuses go a long way in encouraging our players to RP, which leads to us storytelling an RPing much more frequently!"

raisedbynarcissists,fafvmvx,t3_e911uk,1576033018.0,"Ooof, I feel for you so strongly. I used to have a lot of these same things, and my partner has also helped me immensely in finding my voice. I try to take things with my Nmom one experience at a time, as if I have a clean slate. That is probably too kind of me towards her, but it keeps me from feeling like I just want to rage about past hurts whenever we talk. I take her as she is, but know my opinions and my voice are valid. Usually a hand squeeze from my partner (will yours consider coming to holiday stuff with you and your family?) is a reminder that I am strong and loved and deserve to speak my truth. I do, and the more I open up, the more chance Nmom has to know me. She doesn't always really listen, but I don't expect her to all the time like I used to when I was young and still craved her approval and validation in everything I did. Now I know my own worth and I'll try to let it show when I'm around her, but I'm not tolerating her behavior or letting myself be silent. It's uncomfortable, but less uncomfortable than simultaneously bring chastised for not being ""assertive enough"" and also steamrolled by her opinions.

Hope this helps. It's taken 6 years away (not NC but living farther away), tons of therapy, antidepressants, and a truly amazing chosen family (including my partner and in-laws) to make even this much progress."
AmItheAsshole,faf5u3e,t1_faf4hdi,1576015172.0,"Maybe because most people use weddings as a way to unite families (kind of the whole point, whether it is blood or chosen family, etc). Using it to promote something that obviously so many of your family and friends don't seem to understand, that comes off as disrespectful of your family and friends. ""Using"" a wedding for anything than what it is - a celebratory party legally joining two people in a partnership - comes off as generally skeevy.

There's a pretty common list of them out there that's helpful in a lot of situations."
