I don't know exactly what your hair looks like, but I'm guessing that 2 pumps would be good. If you think it would love an extra add another!

Like the others have said I think washing your hair daily would be best. Let your hair sit in the conditioner for around 3-5mins, and try a hair masque 1x weekly - heard coconut oil is heavenly! Good luck!"

HaircareScience,f96z18p,t3_e44idl,1575155402.0,"- Do you usually blow-dry your hair? I'd suggest start letting it air-dry instead, and to be gentle when you're brushing it dry or wet (start combing at the bottom, then work your way upwards).
- Also, try using a hair mask 1x a week! My friend does this using coconut oil and her hair is incredibly thick.
- She also eats a ton of fruits, so I'd suggest trying to amp up the amount you eat a day. An apple after school? A banana at lunch?This also helped my skin!

You should start noticing a difference after around 2 months. If you don't see any results, I strongly recommend pesking your parents about going to see a dermatologist. I really hope this helps you! I'm also struggling with some hair issues, and I hope we can get through this!"
