depression,f4jdpho,t1_f4ih8sg,1571617681.0,Same. I feel the same way. I’m tired of living this life but I don’t have it in me to end it. And I too have this unstable mood all the time. These mood swings are so exhausting.
depression,f46hky9,t3_dj5z5e,1571408903.0,"I totally get you. Last week I had a panic attack at work and it was so embarrassing. I hated it. Sometimes I have this shortness of breath that makes me so scared. Most of the times, I want to end it all. But I’m too much of a coward to do something. I’m actually scared of the pain, but I have all this suicidal thoughts every time and it’s so exhausting to be in this battle with myself. There are better days, sure. But the bad days win in majority."
depression,f27bcml,t1_f26jg77,1570034433.0,"Well, it's very nice to know that I kinda helped you in some way too. Thank you, I've considered writing and I even bought a journal. Maybe I'll start writing soon and I want to start some physical activity as well, but my own laziness always keeps me in bed. I'm just trying to navigate through the idea of actually doing it.

I get you. I've been to several therapists here and I haven't found the right one. Back home (I left my country a few years ago) I had a therapist I really connected with, but when I left, I lost contact with her. I'm glad that you found someone helpful, do you still see that therapist?"
depression,f25uw1a,t1_f25j30e,1569984448.0,"Thank yoy very much for your kind words. I'm still looking for another therapist and I hope I'll find the right one. I'm supposed to take medication, but I'm scared to do it as I have read many things about antidepressants. By the way, did you find something to deal with how you feel? 

Thank you, if you need someone to talk to, you can count on me too. I needed this and I will be forever grateful."
depression,f25fpj0,t3_dbt5ps,1569973368.0,I totally get you. I can't be that easy-going. I just can't. I want to have friends and be cool and not this socially-awkward version of me.
depression,f17mgip,t1_f11vkmr,1569245176.0,"Yeah, I hope that too. :/"
depression,f17m6t5,t1_f12cq34,1569245061.0,"Yeah. My girlfriend is so easy-going and I just can't be that way. I hate that about myself too and it's like you said, I don't think I could ever hurt myself even though I think about it all the time."
depression,f11env7,t3_cml6ni,1569124554.0,"I feel so stuck right now. Like I don't know where to go or how to move forward. I feel like I don't fit in and I struggle making friends because I don't even know how to be myself around people. I spend many hours thinking of ways to end my misery but at the same time I'm so afraid of doing  it, like I'm a coward and I don't have the balls to do it. I want to just stop feeling."
Anxiety,f0yqo4m,t1_f0xgc99,1569075812.0,"Yes, exactly. Like we should be grateful instead but it's so hard..."
Anxiety,f0xftdi,t3_d6wbm6,1569031294.0,"I'm in a relationship where we love each other, but sometimes love doesn't feel enough. And she knows me with anxiety and all. She has been with me through thick and thin. And sometimes I feel no one is going to love me that way again. I don't know. I feel so broken I don't think I can ever be whole again."
Anxiety,f0xcpkl,t3_d6vsdb,1569028576.0,"I completely understand you. I'm never satisfied with anything. It's just like I keep finding excuses and bad things to actually good things. I always want something and when I do have it, it's like I can't seem to enjoy it. I can't stand the pressure. I feel like I never fit in. I found this great job that I've wanted for a long time and now it's like I can't concentrate. I don't know... I'm so tired of having these negatives thoughts all the time."
Anxiety,f0xc6k1,t3_d56opw,1569028127.0,"Same. I keep sleeping and eating too much. And don't get me started on coffee. I'm so tired of not wanting to get out of bed, but I don't know how to control it."
