From your post it honestly sounds like you might prefer St Andrews if you’re looking for a super tight knit community and relationships with your tutors.

You will have a big canteen in the middle of the complex and go and eat breakfast and dinner at set meal times.

Self catered halls are generally more like houses or apartments. You will share your apartment with a few people , you will get your own room again and share the kitchen and bathroom.
