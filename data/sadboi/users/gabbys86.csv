I have A friend like that - always the star of the group. And When We're alone I love that. But when we're in a group she's not the only person that needs to be listened to. So what I do (Sometimes works, sometimes she doesn't pick up on it when she's 'on a roll') is I focus my attention on everybody else and if I see that someone wants to say something I focus on them, I ask ""what did you want to say?"" or just create a separate conversation with the person who wanted to say something - and if the 'star of the group' doesn't notice, more and more people start to join the 'separate' group where they can talk freely.

Do you experience it also if it's maybe a chill sunday with no responsibilities? How do You fall asleep feeling? Is it every day?

This 'small and funny' stuff might seem like it to others but it honestly makes You feel SO small and awkward... I'm so sorry you're going through it. 

I never did but I think maybe You should be straight forward with those people. If you're uncomfortable say something jokingly like ""if you say something like that I'll gladly come back to my cave"" or just honestly say that in this moment they're seeing you, You're trying your best and they should respect that.
