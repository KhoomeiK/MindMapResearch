Marathon morning I got up super early to take care of business. Twice at hotel, once in the porta potty after I checked. I though I was good to go... WRONG! My stomach started to feel cramps about mile 12. It straight up hurt by 13. 14 down and I had to slow to a crawl. Potty at mile 15. I *exploded*.

Then I cry, he yells about it, I cry more, he yells more. Frequently, if this continues too long I lose my shit and act like a full on crazy person :(

We’re in counseling now to work on our communication. A few things she has suggested: if one of you requests a break to think things over & calm down, the other person needs to respect that. I shut down & can’t respond with all that I want to say so she has suggested that if there is something I need to say to him but am afraid to bring up I should write him a letter. I am allowed to ask that I am to think about a topic before giving my answer so that I am less likely to appease by giving the answer that I think he wants. We should use like “I feel that...” instead of “you did this to me...” & should always try to have important talks in a conversational tone instead of an aggressive one. It has helped a lot. The quarantine has been rough on both us so we’re using a lot of those techniques lately!"
