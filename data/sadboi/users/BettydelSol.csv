We‚Äôre in counseling now to work on our communication. A few things she has suggested: if one of you requests a break to think things over & calm down, the other person needs to respect that. I shut down & can‚Äôt respond with all that I want to say so she has suggested that if there is something I need to say to him but am afraid to bring up I should write him a letter. I am allowed to ask that I am to think about a topic before giving my answer so that I am less likely to appease by giving the answer that I think he wants.
