>This does NOT seem worth the hassle at all and unless the carfax is fixed before purchase your resale value will be FUCKED forever. The seller is trying to unload it quick before he has to take the huge hit from selling it or dealing with carfax (if he even is telling the truth) 

I'd  definitely normally agree here, but having bought and sold a decent amount of cars I know when buying from a private party a lot of looking needs to be at the seller as well as the car and this guy definitely doesn't seem like the type to be trying to hide a problem and unload it quick.   
Resell value isn't a big deal to me since this car would have a lower cost of entry compared to similarly had examples and if worse comes to worse if/when I did plan on selling, I'd just part the car out or turn it into a track toy if the carfax were to hurt the resale value that much.

I know I'm giving him a lot of benefit of the doubt here (this is a completely different conversation when I talk to him), but I can't see him really doing this (maybe this is my problem?)"
