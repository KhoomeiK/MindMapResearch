movies,f35pfbg,t3_dd0ynj,1570685009.0,"The movie felt like it had a lot of plot convinient moments and characters and by that I mean that stuff just happens to the main character for no reason at all except to artificially continue the plot in a cheap way not to mention all of the characters are just there,for again plot convinient.

None of the characters except for ,Arthur, have any real significance or interesting stuff to them,They are literally just there to continue the plot in a cheap way that makes it very unsatisfying,not to mention all Arthur does for most of the movie is nothing,most of the scenes in the movie are just there to purely show how oscar baity this movie truly is .

This movie would lead you believe we'll see Arthur as a character but all we see are this style over substance scenes,not to mention, the dialoge is very weak in the beginning and only gets decent at the end and is not just the dialoge but the whole movie gets a little bit better towards the end.

His so call transition through insanity isn't as good,for the simple fact that Arthur does absolutly nothing to tell us that he was even ""normal"" to beggin with.Theres absolutly nothing that makes this so call transition good because this movie does nothing with Arthur.

The only real scenes where style and substance are somewhat balance are the scenes were Arthur is with his therapist,which ends very quick.

To top it off,everything is like in your face and not to mention,this movie is very predictable, simplistict,and lacklusting

Very weak screenplay and dialogue

This movie is purely style over substance and baiting for an oscar."

I already predicted how the show is going to go after season 1.Black Noir is reveal to be homelander clone and guess what? he kills homelander's family.

Homelander thinks it was the Boys that did it and the boys think it was butcher as in season 2 we get too see a even a more gory and darker version of him like in the comics.

The Boys end up ditching butcher of the team and have to deal with vought being in their ass.Vought not wanting homelander and the seven to get involve,they sent payback.Homelander doesn't know about his family death until he comes home from being deploy in the military.In fact,theres episodes where they tell everybody is a secret and that at no cost should homelander know about that but he ends up finding out the true.

Since vought is on to the boys and the boys have no more funding from the CIA and are register has criminals.They come across the photos of the homelander killing his own family which they sent to the CIA and Vought in which they come to a truce with both the CIA and Vought since both the CIA and Vought don't want Homelander going insane and kill people.Homelander eventually saw the photos and goes insane killing a lot of of vought employes while saying ""I didn't do it.I didn't do it""but then he calms down.

In the next episodes we see homelander battling with himself whether he really did it or not and goes in a path of insanity questioning everything

Vought not wanting the homelander to think about his family death since he saw the photos.They create herogasm and Homelander uses that to get his mind of things and comes up with the plan that he uses in the comics.Basicallly attack the white house and then the rest goes down like in the comics.

The Boys throught all of this accept butcher back into the group.

Butcher like in the comics creates a plan to kill all people that even have a trace of compound V and the rest goes like in the comics.Of course this happens after the events of homelander attack on the white house and a few years after the boys have been disbanded.This is the final arc

This doesn't mention the extra arcs like G men and others.This is just the core."

TheOfficialPodcast,eu8nu4k,t3_cejjy9,1563560772.0,"I don't see the point in limb lenghting unless its a sport related reason.The only reason why i care about height wasn't because i wanted to be above everyone else.It was because some sports just require height.I see that its pointless for people to complain about height unless its a sport or physical related not ""muh everybody think im short XD uwu"".Only losers cares about their own height like that."
