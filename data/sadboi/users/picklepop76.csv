civ,forlem7,t1_forl92a,1588014198.0,I love playing as Korea and absolutely hate playing against her. She's someone you have to defeat early on its game over.

depression,f8oina6,t3_e1ex83,1574682824.0,Well the chances of being a mass shooting victim are extremely rare. There is 330 million people in the US and maybe 100 people a year die from mass shootings.
depression,f874pj4,t3_dzeqx2,1574315949.0,People don't understand unless they have gone through this before. I used to be a very well liked person and I had a lot of friends but ever since I dropped out of college I don't have any friends or even the will to live. I'm homeless and sleeping on brother's couch and everyone keeps on telling me to get a job. It's so easy for them to tell me to get a job but they don't understand what I'm going through. I think about taking my life at least every other day and I sleep about 14 hours a day. I've lost 100lbs since April but nobody cares. They act like they do but when I reach out for help no one is there.
SuicideWatch,f8746j3,t3_dzer1c,1574315414.0,"I understand your pain. I couldn't make it past a semester before I dropped out of college. I was a biomedical major with a full ride to a great college and I threw it all away because of my depression. It was the single worst decision I have ever made. My parents were so disappointed in me, my dad only talks to me a few times a year now. My fiance left me for her ex and I haven't been able to hold down a job. I'm homeless and sleep on my brother's couch and only eat a few times a week. College isn't for everyone but if you have devoted your entire life to getting to college, as I had, look at all your options before you close that door."

depression,f1dnz8z,t3_d8ywsr,1569391461.0,"A few months ago I did the same thing. I didn't have the guts to tell them in person and left a 10 page note behind. I made sure to address everyone who I wanted to be addressed in the note,and I made sure to leave a special not for my 1 year old son for when he's older. I was going to jump off a cliff but when I was standing on the edge of the cliff I couldn't do it. I turned around and went home a put the notes in my filing cabinet for another day. It's been months now and a day doesn't go by that I don't want to end my life but I continue to push on for my son. I didn't tell you this to guilt you into not doing it, trust me I know what you're feeling, I just felt like giving advice from someone who has been there.  I hope that whatever you decide you find the peace you are looking for."

depression,exml4bo,t3_ctpjcl,1566434284.0,Don't overthink everything. We as guys are simple people. If you are worried about something ask him flat out he should answer truthfully. If yall have made it this far just fine you should be okay unless something drastic happens.

teenagers,evxzm3u,t3_cluyws,1564916033.0,I know it seems scary. This was a fear I faced at the end of my high school career. The best thing I can say is to be friends with everyone. This country is more divided than ever and its not going to change unless we as people especially young people make that change. It's up to us because it's obvious our leaders don't care.
