WithoutATrace,fr3yfwv,t1_fr3bta3,1589869898.0,"According to what I read online the mother was waiting for her at a tanning salon so I don’t think the boyfriend was waiting for her. Her keys were still in the ignition along with her phone at the church. They also aren’t sure if the cars were there at the same time and don’t completely know if she’s even in the car with the person they’re suspecting. It’s all open in the air rn, but the theory that’s sitting with me is that someone else got to her. Maybe the people that show up randomly and abduct young girls and sell them. I really hope that’s not it, but I don’t know. It’s a church parking lot, she had a destination, and there is also the “why did she pull over” to consider. Keys were in the ignition so she must have got out to talk to someone about something, maybe someone luring her over because they seemed like they needed help.

They also said combing through her social media they found no trace of her contacting someone outside of the norm.

I hope they find her and that nothing bad has happened to her and that I’ve just watched too many crime shows lately."

depression,eqhgx64,t3_bycijd,1560058570.0,"Same stuff happened to me after the PTSD settled in and depression really got a hold of me. I’ll tell you, I was driving around trying to get home (I moved back home from a different state so I should know where I’m at since I lived here 18+ years.) I got lost. I drove 20 minutes out of my way and I didn’t know where I was and I got scared bc my mind just went onto autopilot while I was driving. That shit scared me.

Sometimes it feels like you’re not in control anymore. You feel like you’re so distracted inside that you forget how to function outside.

But, this is also me telling you that you’re stupidly intelligent because your mind is in pain and inside you’re in pain and the smart ones always suffer in this way bc it makes you question your intelligence while questioning yourself. 

Sink or swim 
Will you pull yourself out of your head, or continue to live in the static?"

JUSTNOMIL,eq7xv25,t3_bxe5hn,1559855141.0,I have been guilty of using the guilt trip tactic as well. It is selfish of me and selfish of her to do that. You’re not in the wrong for wanting time with your brother at all and it doesn’t make you a crap daughter either. Don’t let it make you feel bad. Do the lunch and make time for your mom a different day and different time. You got plenty of days to do something w both of them.

Marijuana,eq7vih8,t1_eq7v10j,1559853954.0,I lived in Toledo one year and it was miserable haha. I also lived in Illinois for a year. Weed being illegal sucked. Michigan is currently where I live and I’m still trying to figure everything out.
Marijuana,eq7vblu,t1_eq5v04o,1559853859.0,"For me I also love dabs, but I’ve had it do the opposite for me psychologically. It makes me so weird in the head I’ll just sit in my thoughts and not socialize. It’s cheaper than buying a lot of flower forsure though. I was saving money but losing out on daily activities bc I couldn’t bring myself out of my head when high. 

Vaping wax was easier to do that bc of the lower concentration, but still same idea. Too strong. Something in between flower and dabs might work better but I am still new to all of this and have been smoking for like 3 years now. 

What would you suggest for someone who needs a good inbetween flower and dabbing?"
Marijuana,eq7ue09,t1_eq7u5yj,1559853399.0,"That’s my thought process behind it too. My other thoughts are the two sides of the mania. One is up and one is down, extremes on both sides. Should I smoke a hybrid for it? Would I smoke different strains for different pains of mania? Should I stick to one and see what the triggers are? It’s a world of wonder haha. I have so many questions and ideas but wanted to see what you guys think about it. Indica could be good for a manic high, but would it trigger a low?"
Vaping101,eq7s90y,t1_eq7rtfi,1559852341.0,Haha you’re good forsure doesn’t bother me. I’m a pretty girl but I’d make a pretty boy too.

poetry_critics,eq7ryn6,t1_eq7rpsl,1559852193.0,"The vagueness is to open doors to the rest of the poems in the book of poetry. Calling the Kettle Black is basically hypocrisy in the making. The point from going from a fragmented positive to a bloody negative show the progress of how things can get when you don’t hold true. The change in the “she’s his cheerleader, he said he’d never hit her” shows an open interpretation on how things can change in the blink of an eye, such as the list of things that change in each line to parallel the changing.

depression,eq7ro09,t1_eq7d90x,1559852039.0,Hey. I feel you. I get it. It’s been a long time for me too. But guess what? You’re not alone. I’m right here with you. Let’s fight this shit. Let’s be better. We can’t be sad forever because we have seen it is possible to be happy. It’s just a puzzle to solve like the ones in tomb raider to help Laura raid those tombs. We have some discovering to do about ourselves. You don’t gotta do it alone either. Share your stories. I would love to read them.  Don’t give up. If I can’t give up neither can you. There is this little thing called faith. Try to believe it will work out and that’s what you’ll attract. Don’t lose it because only bad will follow. I don’t want to be sad anymore and I need people like you to work with me to be happier. It gives me hope seeing others try to be better too. I want to be that little bit of faith for you. Here I am. You got this.
Vaping101,eq7r1aw,t1_eq7qwmz,1559851685.0,"Haha thanks guy I’m a gal, but I’ll be whoever you want me to be on the internet ;) 

thanks though, I appreciate your appreciation for my language and analogy. Hopefully you just had a faulty coil like me and I don’t wanna trash the Nord bc I’ve been a fan since buying mine about 2-3 months ago."
Vaping101,eq7qr4u,t3_bxkwut,1559851544.0,I have a Smok Nord and I don’t smoke cigarettes anymore. I vape salt based E Liquid at 30mg. It’s higher concentration of nicotine help me not touch a cigarette and keep me from freaking out on someone. I also don’t smoke as much as if I were chain smoking cigarettes and it is less time consuming on work breaks. The Nord is small and fits in the pocket and hits decently hard with quite a bit of flavor. The coils I use for it are 1.4. You can buy them in a 5 pack for about 15 dollars and the mod cost me about 40 I believe. Juice is usually 20 and lasts a while. Check into the Nord and see if that is more your speed. It’s low maintenance but the only problem is I may or may not have a faulty coil from the pack (irritating I know) but it could be cheaper and easier than a box mod.
Vaping101,eq7qbus,t1_eq7pqv7,1559851331.0,Consistency is a thing of the past with the overpopulation of massed produced items. Eventually there will be malfunctions such as there is even in the human body with cellular division over time. It’s a problem and I think that might be it. I’m currently going through the same thing as you at this very moment. I’m on coil two hoping for better results than coil one since changing it an hour ago. I’m giving it time to soak up rn to see if there is any change and if it was just a faulty coil.
Vaping,eq7q0wt,t3_bxkroi,1559851185.0,My Nord has the same color scheme/art design as yours! That’s dope!
Vaping101,eq7nwol,t3_b8fwl4,1559850176.0,I’ve got a Nord right now and it has been hit and miss with the coils for me to be honest. Some die faster than others and some just taste straight burnt when I change it and it could partially be my fault and partially the coil. Sometimes no matter how much I clean it it’ll have a burnt taste until I put another coil into it from the pack of 5 over the new one I just installed. Could be maybe a faulty coil?
poetry_critics,eq7g76y,t1_eq7g414,1559846228.0,Yes it is supposed to get rougher as the progress of something “beautiful” goes dark. It was done on purpose

creepypasta,eq7dlpj,t3_bxbkvm,1559844957.0,"Not bad. I like where this is going. There could have been a little more done with it to add to the creepy factor. My favorite part was the door, where she locked it and then Momo comes out of the closet. I liked that a lot. What I would have liked to see was her trying to drive away and Momo being in the passenger seat to fuck with her to end it. That would have been lit. And when she was sitting there in the room... too much reliance on “paralyzed with fear” but her actions in the beginning doesn’t make the actress look like she would have waited that long. I would have made her bolt faster than what she did if you do any editing towards it. However, well done. My heart did beat a little quicker with anticipation."
poetry_critics,eq6xkfb,t1_eq6kiiw,1559837113.0,That’s great feedback and I agree. That would sound much better
