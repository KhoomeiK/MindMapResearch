BPD,fr1d1og,t3_glts1h,1589817576.0,"I just got a diagnosis of BPD. I did some research and found that a lot of mental health professionals are biased and think BPD people lie a lot. That they basically make assumptions that are detrimental to the patients treatment.

 For years I was diagnosed with, Depression, Anxiety and PTSD and I got a lot help. I don't want that to change. My current Psychiatrist told me he had suspected it since last year (did 3 Outpatient programs) that marked off enough boxes from the psychologist's notes. He told me this year after more observation. Should I tell my therapist? I want to keep being taken seriously."

Then I use LA looks gel after that, let it dry and scrunch out the crunch. Then I avoid touching my hair as much as possible.
