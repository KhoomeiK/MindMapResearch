Your concerns are totally valid! And it‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre thinking of them and being wary to begin with, some people just settle for what they have, which isn‚Äôt always good. Make sure to keep up putting yourself first like you‚Äôre practicing now. 

If the actions keep up, let her know how you feel. It isn‚Äôt fair to you to get shit on for one tiny thing, and if keeps doing it, it realistically isn‚Äôt going to stop. If she doesn‚Äôt understand, or fights back, it‚Äôs probably best to let it go. That said, everyone has their problems going on. But, it isn‚Äôt healthy for THEM to let their problems out on someone else and isn‚Äôt healthy for the receiving side to deal with it. 

If you value the friendship, get down to the bottom of her actions, and why she spazzed out. Let her know calmly it isn‚Äôt really cool for her to take it out on you. None of us are perfect and we all know that. If she‚Äôs rational, she‚Äôs understand. 

To play devils advocate, keep in mind, you don‚Äôt have to put up with anything. You could dip now if you wanted, because she definitely WAS unfair. You don‚Äôt have to try and figure out her problems and help her grow as a person. That‚Äôs her job to do. But, sometimes we need a little push. 

Best of luck"
whatsbotheringyou,flt8zkc,t3_fqzazw,1585463286.0,"On surface level it sounds like she‚Äôs being dramatic, but if she‚Äôs genuinely never ever snappy or like this, then it‚Äôs just her bad day. 

When people act different then something is up. Always check on your friends. When she said she was having a rough day, you guys just continued to talk about the assignment. It may have been better to ask her what was wrong or see if she wanted to vent. She may have been upset that you didn‚Äôt ask about her day and just projected that anger back at you. 

Giving her the benefit of the doubt I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a red flag, but if this weird behavior keeps up, then it totally is. 

I‚Äôd just text her and ask if she was okay, apologize for earlier, and ask her why her day was rough. She might be like ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt wanna talk about it anymore‚Äù just cuz some ppl are like that but she‚Äôll come around"

WWOOF,fdqtfmi,t3_emsa4z,1578674499.0,"It‚Äôs definitely possible, when me and my ex stayed in Colorado for a few months he got a part time job. This is all the info/advice I can give. 

1. Make sure your host is okay with it. As long as your hours don‚Äôt cut into their time, they realistically won‚Äôt have a problem with it, but it‚Äôs always important to discuss your intentions/plans beforehand, out of respect. 
2. You‚Äôd probably have to stay on one farm for a few months at a time. When my ex got his job, we planned to stay the entire season. Sometimes his hours would cut into our work, but we had many volunteers so it wasn‚Äôt anything detrimental. But also keep in mind, some hosts only allow one or two volunteers at a time, and we had 5. 
3. Apply in the area before you go. Let them know it‚Äôll be temporary. It may put you at a disadvantage compared to other applicants, but it‚Äôll be worse giving them the wrong impression. 
4. Most hosts are willing to drive to the nearest airport, if you want to drop your insurance for the time being. With staying in one area for awhile, gaining more monthly income, it may come out cheaper to just fly and Uber. That said, I know it‚Äôs a lot better for exploring the area and adventuring when you have your own car, but it‚Äôs something to think about. 
5. The rule of thumb I had with wwoofing and saving money was to calculate the amount of your travels, there and back home, and double that. This is in case of any emergencies. 

I hope this helped some!"
