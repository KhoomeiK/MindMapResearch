invasivespecies,fplmhud,t3_ge6cf0,1588715394.0,"You kind of touched upon the answer here when you talked about seeing birds being aggressive towards more native species. An invasive species may be a better competitor for resources in an area than native species live (such as food, water, territory), so over time they have the ability to ‚Äúpush out them out‚Äù of their home, so to speak. If a bigger bird comes in and eats all of the native species‚Äô food source, or prevents them from nesting, it can deplete or drive out the native population over time. Another layer to this dynamic is how some native species are crucial to maintaining balance in an ecosystem, so when they are outcompeted by an invasive species it can affect a more than just that one species. If you‚Äôre interested you should look into keystone species and how invasive organisms can cause ecosystems to collapse. I hope this was a bit helpful!"

depression,f60rccz,t3_dq62r3,1572624201.0,"I routinely fall into depressive episodes and initially, they‚Äôd go on for months with me wallowing in how much nothing I felt. In the past two years I‚Äôve been able to navigate these rough patches a little more efficiently (thanks to accepting that I need medical help for my condition, seeing doctors semi-regularly, and trying to take better care of myself via eating regular meals/exercising), and I can say that the biggest thing I‚Äôve learned is you need to move around. Even if it is just getting up to take a shower, going to the store for milk, or taking a walk around the block, I try to set one to three goals (depending on how I feel) per day that involve me not laying around, and I do them. It might take an hour to get to, it might take five hours to muster up the energy to brush my teeth, but once it‚Äôs done I can check that off my list and feel like at least I did *something* today. I find that having this routine of itemizing things to get done and appreciating that they are completed has helped me achieve a position where I can better gain control over myself when things get particularly challenging. I hope this idea might be able to help you too, depression is painful but remember it‚Äôs important we never stop trying different ways to cope with it‚Äôs symptoms!"

relationships,eqt7f0v,t3_bzkxhg,1560304253.0,"It doesn‚Äôt sound like you brought up money to hold it over his head, but rather to make a point that you‚Äôve put in all this effort - time, money, traveling, and probably a ton more based on how your relationship sounds - only for him to flip flop for seven years. The way he seemed to twist it into you somehow rubbing a financial favor in his face comes off as a victimizing tactic.  I personally feel as though it‚Äôs strange that you were together for so long, but he didn‚Äôt want to emotionally rely on you or share his personal struggles, which two people in a healthy relationship should do. Communication is so important! It was interesting to me how when he initially came back he only wanted to be friends with benefits; it doesn‚Äôt sound like this man views your relationship the way you do, and him avoiding the topic of marriage after stating he was planning on it sounds like he‚Äôs only telling you things you want to hear that will work for his own benefit. I don‚Äôt think you should feel bad about mentioning him losing weight or that you bought his plane tickets for all this time - you‚Äôre rightfully upset after having invested so much (not just the money) only to have him string you along to believe you‚Äôd have a future when he knew he didn‚Äôt feel that way. This was also a *seven year relationship*. He should have respected you enough to be upfront and more open after all that time. Focus on yourself, you clearly have a lot going for you, a kind heart, and a good head on your shoulders. Your ex can be a valuable lesson on what you do and don‚Äôt want in a relationship, and I‚Äôm sure this experience will teach you more about knowing and loving yourself. ‚ô•Ô∏è"

Sometimes this is such a daunting feeling, and I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll have to fake happiness for the rest of my life. 

Even though you feel overwhelmed at times, I think it is amazing and you deserve recognition for pushing yourself out of your comfort zone to do volunteer work. Taking breaks to gather yourself shouldn‚Äôt be shameful, because if you don‚Äôt take care of yourself who will? No one knows you better than you. And it‚Äôs better to take little stops along the way than completely burn yourself out. The children you work with are so fortunate that you are there to give them attention and compassion, especially when it is so difficult to have those feelings for yourself at times.
