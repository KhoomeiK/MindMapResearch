PS: I think the first step is accept that you have feeling but suppress so deep and you can't reach.i accept this first even I didn't believe this I believe I am a sociopath or something wrong with me and wanna die.then i gave me a chance to me and accepted i have emotion but for a reason i suppressed.then it started to return(this is just my experience every experience is personal)"
