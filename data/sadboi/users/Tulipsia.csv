Where we live, polygamy is illegal, so its very common for those here who are polyamorous to refer to their significant others as spouses, regardless of actual legal status.

Now, if I know I need help, I go with ""not yet,"" or ""I haven't decided."" I try to let them know i am serious, but i have options, and it depends on how i want to go out that day. If I don't need help I explain passive suicidality (to mental health professionals who should know).

BPD,fla28t1,t3_fnhm2f,1584975017.0,"Hi there. 36 year old mom here. Yes I get the urge to smash all the things sometimes. I've actually never even heard of the cold water on the face thing, but I do tend to hold ice cubes in my hand till they melt when I feel like I'm coming out of my skin. Kinda reminds me that the skin is part of me. I also spend a lot of time hiding from my family in my room (mostly my kid, he is special needs and often violent and it triggers my ptsd badly), and occasionally screaming into pillows. Seems to get the edge off the rage. I had a therapist that suggested really intense upper body workouts, like boxing (at a bag), or weight lifting, but my body is falling apart even faster than my mind so that's out. I crochet a lot, and do cross stitch, and that seems to keep my hands and mind occupied enough to sort of zone out. Also I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each project.

I know you said PM is better but I'm at the peak of overwhelmed lately so a direct conversation is too much for me. However I'm happy to continue in comment form as I have time throughout the day.  Remember in time things will feel different. I will never promise it will be all better, but it will be different, and then change again, over and over, and sometimes it's good."

We have been to counseling together and separate and we know each others needs vs wants and we talk and compromise. 

Also, and this is not for everyone, we are polyamorous. So in addition to my marriage, I have a girlfriend who lives with us. We have been together about a year and a half. She does her best to educate herself on bpd, and I do my best to explain my crazy brain as matter-of-factly as I can.

So you're never too young to quit, and your bottom only needs to be as low as it needs to be, you can stop the down elevator whenever you want! There are absolutely other ways to get sober: church, smart recovery, to name a couple. Don't be scared off AA because of ""magic sky daddy,"" or whatever. I started out as agnostic/atheist and now I identify as a witch. You take what helps from the program and insert that into the places it says God, simple as that.
