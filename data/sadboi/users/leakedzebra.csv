I think it is very important to take a piece of information and distinguish it from opinion.

It irritates me that News has now become more about opinions and emotions rather than fact. This is why I find Me. Gupta to be extremely reliable and non biased, and more importantly his stories are extremely well researched.

He reports NEWS as the facts present themselves, and doesn't put stories. He's always open to ammending his narrative as new information comes to light, which makes me trust him as my prefered news source."

I've been handling med school work unmedicated for 3 years now and it's been hell. 
Been failing classes left and right.
But it's not all a downhill spiral I promise you!

Procrastination is our biggest enemy, and if you overcome that it's 70% of the job done.

Also, set extremely short targets, what I found is that studyin one question/topic/section at a time, and taking a forced break after that helps me loads.

The short span of focus helps you accomplish a goal faster and gives you that shor of dopamine on accomplishing it that's helps keep you motivated.

Realise that without the meds, we can't really change the game, so we've got to play by the ADD rules, short spans of attention with forced distraction, you're basically doing what your body is forcing you to do, but you're bending it to your advantage.

Take care, and bestest vibes."

Good job!!!

Life tip; med school ain’t easy for normal people, and trust me it’s hell for Me with ADD.

So here’s the thing, never fall out of love with what you’re doing okay? 
Save this post, save the excitement and use it to fuel you. 
Believe me.
It gets better when you start loving it. 
It really makes the long hours of studying much more manageable, if you let the love for what you’re doing fuel you.

And never let your head fall down low. Hold it high, through tough times and hurdles. You worked your ass off this, and you’re not going to ever give up. Because you’ve earned this. 
You’ve probably worked harder than most other classmates, and damnit every day Is a victory.

Power to you,
And do post if you ever need help.
We’re all here"

Talk to him! I’m hoping there is still love in there! Try to work something out, at least for the kids’ sake. 

Talk to your sons, tell them what you feel. Talk to your parents, close family and close friends. Tell the, what you feel. Make sure you’re not taking an impulsive depiction, because sometimes perspective can change a lot.


Now a reality check. You need to do you first, before all else. You have a limited time here, and you need to be happy. You only owe responsibility towards your boys, and yourself, nobody else. 
If after all your best efforts and love and dedication, the idiot husband still spirals and refuses any help, he’s directly detrimental to you and your boys.

harrypotter,fdefaht,t3_ekwrgs,1578337765.0,"Totally agree with you guys.
I think the most beautiful thing about sorting, at Hogwarts is that there's no 'ends justifying the means'
The houses are basically the 'means' you use to accomplish your goals, and your general outlook on life.
So I honestly think Dumbledore would've made a perfect Slytherin. He has absolutely every trait.
It's sad that the books largely associated Slytherin with evil or spite, like Umbridge, because any person could be that, no matter their house.
Rather, Slytherin epitomizes craftiness, deceit and deep calculation, all of which are arguably what made Dumbledore the greatest wizard ever."
