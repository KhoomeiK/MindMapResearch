MentalHealthUK,fqpndyo,t3_gk61si,1589550305.0,"So true. There's so much emphasis on how much home schooling they are getting done, the quality, the quantity. How about their health? How are they coping away from their peers, teachers, external support systems?"
Blogging,fqp5hf2,t3_gbdsgq,1589535727.0,"Hey guys!! I would be so grateful if someone could take a look at my blog on mental health!! I'm so new to this and have never been a great writer!!

So grateful for any advice or tips I can apply, I am always looking to improve. [Greetings Minds ](https://greetingsmind.wordpress.com)"
recovery,fql166k,t1_fqjqkg5,1589442703.0,"Thank you üòä yes!

Compassion,fqeg52h,t1_fqed81k,1589306994.0,You're so welcome. Remember to be kind to yourself.
mentalhealth,fqefyf4,t1_fqe9mfk,1589306909.0,"I completely understand what you are saying. I suffer from severe clinical depression myself so this hasn't come from a thoughtless place. I am find that because my brain in naturally wired to think negatively, to assume the worst always....despite what I know to be true and it is completely out of my control. What I am saying is that I need to be compassionate to those thoughts accept that I feel them but try to tell myself the positives, try to find/do things that I either currently enjoy or I remember enjoying in the past. I hope that makes a little sense üòä"

mentalhealth,fqdjavh,t1_fqdhxvb,1589290880.0,"You know if you can't say anything nice there is really no need to say anything at all. For some positive thinking is action, sometimes it's all that is missing because it's so easily put aside."
depressed,fqa71e9,t1_fqa33fh,1589213952.0,Ah Great!! I post every Sunday üòä
depressed,fqa23yb,t1_fq9zkgk,1589211438.0,"I have a blog on mental health, would this be a topic you would be interested in me covering??"
depressed,fqa1956,t1_fq9zkgk,1589210989.0,Yes along the lines of! I might say right at 10 I'll study for an hour and so on!
depressed,fq9z0gf,t3_ghno3m,1589209795.0,I feel you!! I have to force myself up because I feel even worse if I don't get out if bed. Sounds so silly but I literally have to give myself a count down üôà I'll say to myself I'm going to count down from 10 then I'll kick the covers off!!
Wordpress,fq9a00y,t1_fq99z02,1589190995.0,Thank you! No I can't with WordPress.com
Wordpress,fq99xuw,t1_fq99x6r,1589190931.0,Yeah
Wordpress,fq99v4u,t1_fq99tme,1589190851.0,Everything the whole thing. I am using the free domain...
Wordpress,fq99kyv,t1_fq995sk,1589190554.0,I am totally confused
Wordpress,fq98rvs,t1_fq910eu,1589189713.0,What do you do of there is no SPF alignment?
Wordpress,fq9533b,t1_fq910eu,1589185844.0,I will give those things a go. Thank you very much!!
mentalillness,fq6r9t3,t1_fq6qzgj,1589136789.0,Thank you so very much!! That honestly means the world. I hope that it was some help to you and that you can join me on my journey. ‚ù§
Anxiety,fq6nta2,t1_fq6nlnj,1589135106.0,I do apologise!! Totally understand and yes the intention was purely to give support and spread awareness. Thank you for your understanding!
fuckeatingdisorders,fq64j72,t3_gh2xsd,1589124342.0,"From my experience with weight gain I've had to keep increasing every few weeks because your body gets used to the additional calories it is receiving. 2500 may have been enough initially but that is actually quite a low about of calories on average for weight gain. Not to mention it totally depends on gender, build, height, metabolism and movement! I would recommend you increase by about 300 then again if you need to. Hope that helped üòä"
fuckeatingdisorders,fpv8lnu,t3_gfl3ia,1588938480.0,"I feel you!! I have to tell myself that if I'm questioning whether it's enough, it's probably because it's too little. At the end of the day you can't really have too much if you are recovering from a restrictive eating disorder and your body needs it ‚ù§"
mentalhealth,fpsiu7j,t1_fpsf1ay,1588874200.0,Yes of course that would be brilliant if you checked it out!!! Feel free to subscribe and share it if you enjoy üòähttps://greetingsmind.wordpress.com/blog-2/
AnorexiaRecovery,fprbdqz,t3_gf2r94,1588849107.0,"Yes of course!! If you think about the way that people eat that do not suffer from an eating disorder...it's all about balance. Not everyone has their five a day every day!! The most important thing is that you are providing your body with adequate nuteition and you are feeling better in yourself mentally üòä I have a meal plan but I certainly don't always eat my five a day. When you've restricted so long salad become less appealing.... so what if I fancy a sweet lunch??
Edit: my lunch today includes hot cross buns and lotus spread üòâ"
mentalhealth,fpoclo8,t3_gek4b1,1588782216.0,"Absolutely couldn't have put it better myself!! This is so incredibly important and a very hot topic particularly at this time. There's a huuuuuge difference between feeling nervous for an interview and suffering with crippling anxiety, there's dissapointment at failing an exam and there's depression. These aren't just words to throw around lightly. I've recently started a blog on mental health that I am hoping can become a positive, safe and supportive environment where we can be encouraging without judgment and spread awareness around mental health!"
Anxiety,fpobtqo,t3_geiyn7,1588781839.0,"Yes! With literally everything I do! For me it ties into both my anxiety and perfectionism as I explain in my blog post on perfectionism. The issue persists because I never actually take the risks and therefore never have anything to learn from, don't get any evidence to prove myself wrong..."
depression,fpo8umz,t1_fpo2ciu,1588780383.0,I've written a blog post on productivity that may be of interest to you? Might make you realise that there's nothing wrong with feeling the way you do?
depression,fpnim1i,t3_gei189,1588764110.0,Totally! Don't beat yourself up! Sometimes just getting out of bed is a task in itself. I have found that action comes before motivation. I may not feel like doing anything but if I force myself to I can get into it and even sometimes enjoy it...
AnorexiaNervosa,fpndnb8,t3_gedhgg,1588759225.0,"If you feel able I think you should talk to them. Let them know that you appreciate what they are doing and you understand that it's only because they care for you and worry. But, try to explain that unfortunately it is having the opposite effect. It is proving detrimental. It is drawing your attention to food and almost intimidating you to the point where you end up unnecessarily compensating. Perhaps you can suggest things to them that do help so that they know you do want their support but you can guide it?"
AnorexiaNervosa,fpnda6v,t3_gedtjz,1588758844.0,"Yes I've been there!! I've had to ask myself why I hate myself for eating what I did? What do I actually achieve from that? Instead tell yourself....I ate two meals, great that's progress in the right direction, I made my partner smile, he was proud of me, I have nourished my body and it can trust me a little more because of today. I am allowed to rest now because I have worked so hard today to fight this invisible battle with my own mind. I care for myself, the eating disorder does not care for me and only wants the worst for me. It gives me short term relief yes, but long term suffering and it's hurting those around me. 
Remember, don't be too hard on yourself, this is such a difficult fight to face and each day you are making progress to get your life back!!"
AnorexiaRecovery,fpn7u4n,t3_gdwssv,1588753251.0,That's so amazing to read!! To hear that you are taking your life back for yourself and not letting this nasty debilitating illness steal from you anymore!! I hope that you are being kind to yourself and enjoying showing ED whoes boss!!
depressed,fpn6x4f,t3_gec5yo,1588752340.0,I feel like I can make it help if I really gear the conversation towards what I want to discuss. Like rather than answering the questions they ask I'll bring up what's been bothering me. It kinda helps just to hear that I'm not crazy and that my opinion makes sense and is listened too. Idk sometimes it's useless but sometimes if I really use it to vent and have a little cry it can lift a weight off.
