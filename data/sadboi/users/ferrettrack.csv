During this time you will probably see a few extra pounds (muscles), extra energy bursts ( zoomies), and I usually see a difference in their head bone structure.  The Toms widen between their eyes and the nose leather gets a bit bigger. (even if they are fixed). With the ladies, more weight and just a bigger general bone structure.
