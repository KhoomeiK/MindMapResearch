1. Excessive gift/junk giving. She is legitimately a hoarder and I'm a minimalist. So I outlined a rule that baby will not need gifts until the nursery is ready and baby shower/gift registry has been in place. 

2.  She also believes that she can stop by any time, any day of the week. She once stopped by at 9:30 on a Tuesday, I didn't even come downstairs because I was in bed (I work 10 hour shifts). I informed her that I needed more rest than usual and it would be better to have planned visits. You would think this is common sense, but I learned at an early stage of our relationship that she stops by all of her kid's houses, unannounced on a weekly basis. 

I'm hoping this clear communication will resonate healthy boundaries, however I sense she gets resentful and cowardly standoffish when she feels ""threatened"". She's 72 going on 14. Nice person, very faithful but extremely coddling. Something I'm not used to."

I decided that when I told her about our pregnancy, I was going to be firm about the boundaries. It's been hard, because she acted like a victim at first when she would ignore my requests and I'd call her out on it, however now, 8-10 weeks later, she has backed off (probably has a lot to do with quarantine life but still leaps and bounds) She even threatened to not have a baby shower...I was like ""I never asked for one, pretty sure my mom wanted to throw one for me anyway!!"" 

My husband and I have had some friction because she has gotten under my skin so badly that it's hard for my to see the silver lining, but im glad I'm getting my expectations and boundaries set now, than riding a resentment wave for the rest of my miserable life.

Omg I'm too new to Reddit but the quote in blue next to your name (dont know what this is or how it got there...)!!! ""Ya lied again Mahkol"" 🤣🤣 you people light up my life and are literally one of the only reasons I continue to watch this show."
Ozark,fo3q0h7,t3_g5g1jz,1587491060.0,I loved WACO.. and she did an amazing job in it. I couldn't help but to hear Ruth's voice in the back of my head. Truth be told I wish Michelle's alter ego busted out and escaped the sad ending.

Not sure if those things are real, but if I were that ugly of a person - I'd accentuate my boobs as much as possible as well. Seems to work on most of the attractive people on this show. 👉🙄"
