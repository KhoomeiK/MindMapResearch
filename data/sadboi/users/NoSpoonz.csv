So far I like it, but I'm not the biggest fan of the resting system they have instead of AP or mana. Maybe I'll get into it later. The way you describe it makes me think I'll walk away lukewarm since I like taking the time to know the characters. I was also hoping for a little more content than what is offered (based on what people are saying) but I guess I can't complain if it was $3 lol."
