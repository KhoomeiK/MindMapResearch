As ""stay at home"" is the season, sooner or later my food stock at home is going to run out, and then I (and maybe some of you) will have to rely on food delivered to our homes, such as Pizza hut delivery or Uber eats.

How do I reduce the coronavirus risk when my food is delivered to my home?

Do I need to use gloves or serviettes to get the food?

Cant the virus survive if the food is microwaved for 30-60s?

Please advise
