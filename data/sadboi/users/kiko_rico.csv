I’d encourage you to tell your parents and let them know what you’ve been thinking. I understand that u might be ashamed but there’s no reason to, you’re just looking out for yourself, and they love you so they are the ones that you can and should really count on about these things.

You’re only 13 and that’s great because it makes it easier to treat and prevent whatever you’re going through from getting worse. And who knows, maybe a couple of years from now u might even forget this ever even bothered you."

I had been compulsively searching / self-diagnosing and living with extreme anxiety for a long time and, that day, during the test, I think I had a panic attack, which convinced me even further that was schizophrenia. I had never felt so lost in my life! That was over a year ago, but after that day, I’ve never been the same...

Both my brother and my father madly knocking on the door saying “wake up, u can’t just waste money and stay in bed, we’re paying a lot for you to go to the gym” which makes me feel even more depressed.

But here’s what I think:
If it’s “breaking” you then save yourself, you know, like they teach you in the airplane to put your mask first and only then help the others. And the reason why I see it that way is because there’s only so much you can sacrifice before getting a mental illness yourself. But that’s only if you feel like you REALLY can’t take anymore and you’re willing to sacrifice your relationship for your own sake. 

If not, then getting him to help around could benefit the both of you. 
Does he have a job or any source of income? 

Also, is he getting treated? Does he take meds? If not, maybe that’s your happy ending..."
