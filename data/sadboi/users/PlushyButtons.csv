She used to be involved in the same industry as Joe, but she has since worked to reverse the harm she inflicted and more. Big Cat Rescue is now one of the best big cat sanctuaries in the country. Her husband's disappearance has multiple possible reasons besides her dragging a body to a rescue center and eat the cats to eat the evidence, bones and all.

Also, who is having official merchandise profiting off of causing them a bitch? Who has absolute morons lingering about their home and place of work? Who is being sent threats? Who is having people speculate whether or not they killed their husband as if they're all have a forensics degree because they watched a netflix show?

Joe Exotic is a horrid man and it is so absurd that people have decided to glorify/romanticize him because he's a weirdo."

OpenChristian,fb66ltp,t3_ebel75,1576542671.0,"**(Warning: mention of pedophilia in Leviticus)** 

Being gay is not a sin. The term ""*homosexuality*"" was placed into the Bible in the last century. Leviticus's original translation was talking about men raping boys. Yeshua was never documented to talk about being gay, and the only times it is mentioned is in the books written by Saul, someone who did not know Yeshua personally and is still debatable on being a reliable source. 

In short, without all the fancy talk, you're fine but I get the pain. Homophobia sucks and it's damn hard to stay religious when said religion is a big source of homophobia you face. We got this, buddy.

~~Also, Hell may not exist, Yeshua has two dads, David and  Yehonatan were gay aghodufhogudhagoudgh~~"

If you are really passionate about learning though, I was taught by my professor about making connections upon the first meeting.

* Know how to fingerspell your first and last name. Make sure to make a distinction between first and last names. Also, it isn't rude to ask someone to repeat their name until you understand.
* After names, you will most likely be asked if you are Deaf or hearing. The conversation branches out based on your answer, but you're asking for basics, so I won't type it all out, haha.

So you could do this (I'm not the greatest at typing out like this, sorry!):  
HELLO, NICE + MEET-you. ME + NAME \[fingerspell your name\]. ME + (HEARING or DEAF).

You can also learn how to say that you're learning. (ME + LEARNING). Good luck on ASL 1!"
