AskFeminists,fnifqsk,t3_g1vovc,1586979228.0,"I totally relate. I'm 19 years old, and my inner feminist awoke when I was 16. Back then I used to be utterly convinced that I wasn't ""feminist enough"" or ""didn't know enough (or read enough, or went to enough manifestations) about feminism to call myself a feminist""; and now I know that a lot of that had to do with me being very young and insecure. But back then it made me talk and express myself in a full-of-doubt, not-assertive-at-all kind of way. Not saying that that's your issue AT ALL. What I also happened to notice is that people who are not feminists tend to feel insecure and even threatened when they see, hear, read, someone who not only is a feminist, but also a very young and intelligent person. It makes them feel like ignorants, and nobody wants to feel that way. I guess it makes them feel self-conscious about their lack of knowledge and awareness in the matter, even more if you happen to be talking about unfair wages with a working woman who is not a feminist for example, she can interpret the whole thing as ""look, I'm half your age and I know way more about your struggles than you do"". That can be positive in a certain way, since perhaps you're bringing light to an issue the other person is not aware and will appreciate you pointing it out for them. Or not and they will tell you you're kid who doesn't know anything about life in any way. It has totally happend to me. 
I guess my advice is not to give up, even if the other person doesn't take you seriously, whatever you say will stay in their head one way or another, and that can be very powerful. And the other piece of advice is to not always interpret that the other person is not taking you seriously, since as I said before, it can be just a defense mechanism activated from feeling like you're overpowering them, not only intellectually but also morally. And, above all, you're not alone.
Wish you the best üß°"

BDSMAdvice,fna2y6a,t3_g0iz99,1586790008.0,"My personal opinion is that you shouldn't do something you don't really want to do. From what you say in the post, you are not exited nor curious for this at all. So, even if you decide to try it, you wouldn't be doing it from a deep true desire, and I think that's the whole point of BDSM: it comes from within.
Also, don't turn yourself into someone you are not because you're afraid of your husband leaving you. I do understand that it's very scary and it's uncharted territory, but please, do not force yourself to take a roll you actually don't want.

sex,fn6z31g,t1_fn6p7co,1586710149.0,"Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I want to emphasize the ‚Äúmaybe she likes her new body‚Äù part. Talking as a fat girl, just because you‚Äôre fat doesn‚Äôt instantly mean that you hate your body and want to change it. I think there‚Äôs an understatement that fat people want desperately to lose weight. So completely wrong. And the wife shouldn‚Äôt under no circumstances change her body just because her husband wants it.
Also, so many people saying that ‚Äúshe needs to lose weight because it‚Äôs unhealthy‚Äù. Do some research please. There are thin unhealthy people and fat healthy people. Don‚Äôt try to cover your fat shaming with ‚Äúhealth concerns‚Äù and discrimination. Fat does not equal unhealthy. And, above all, fat does not equal ‚Äúplace your opinions here‚Äù. Her being fat doesn‚Äôt mean that you can give out opinions and assumptions about her life and body, specially because no one asked you to."

relationships,fmt6ruc,t3_fx02zd,1586367769.0,"I'm just astonished to read so many replies advising you to break up, as if they knew your relationship, as if they knew your boyfriend or you. If this girl was a dude, NO ONE would be saying anything or telling you to dump him. 
I know for a fact that true and meaningful friendships (completely unsexualised) between guys and girls are 100% real. I've experienced it. Besides, YOU DON'T KNOW FOR A FACT IF HE'S CHEATING. You don't. Please ignore all the crazy advice on him being a piece of shit and the girl being some kind of manipulate bitch. It's YOUR relationship, handle it as such. 
In my opinion, he might be moving in with her because she's actually a friend, and anyone who cares about a friend will at least try to help them out if needed. About the girl, do not put all this hatred and insecurity on her. You don't know her at all for what you're saying. Even if you bf is cheating on you, that would be on him, not the girl. He's the one that owes you loyalty and honesty, not her. 
My advice is; have an actual deep conversation with him. Ask him to take a couple of days to for real examine and think about his friendship with this girl, to truly evaluate if he has any romantic or sexual feelings for her or not, since he might not be conscious of his feelings. Ask him to be honest enough to tell you the result of that. Then you will know. 
Whatever you decide to do, please don't act impulsively and out of insecurity, you could be ending a good relationship. **And sure as hell don't act based on the insecurities, past experiences and grudges of all the people of this thread.**"

Anxiety,fm33pkf,t3_fspqwh,1585712078.0,"I totally relate. It sucks when a friendship ends abruptly without actually sitting down and getting closure through a good conversation. It sucks even more if your had romantic feelings for that person. I also understand being afraid of getting hurt again, of being rejected once more and feeling even shittier about yourself. I do not think that any of your actions could be perceived as bad or upsetting. But I do think it‚Äôs all in your head. The insecurity of coming off as clingy or intense, and the fear of being rejected; both of them lie in your mind. It‚Äôs not real and it‚Äôs not logic. Not all of the guys are the same, you just had that one case of bad luck with the counselor dude, who clearly was a total asshole.

Anxiety,fm31v3n,t3_frslfn,1585710755.0,"I soooo relate to this. I feel the need to ask if the other person is mad or upset at me all the time. Even when there hasn‚Äôt been any type of conflict. I connect it to my overthinking habit. My head spins around the same topic/person for a long time and comes up with the craziest theories about everyone hating me for some insane reason. Also happens with strangers or recent acquaintances, I‚Äôm always thinking that the other person doesn‚Äôt like me, even though they don‚Äôt actually know me. Throughout texts too, I tend to feel scared to texting or speaking first; like if I needed reassurance that the other person doesn‚Äôt hate me before I address them in any way. This leads me to feel like I need to overcompensate for everything to everyone.
In my opinion the best way to control this kind of anxiety is actually applying logic to the situation, kind of shutting off your emotions for five seconds and for real mentally process each and everyone of the ‚Äúreasons‚Äù why everyone is mad at you; since the vast majority of the time, all your inner arguments so as to why people hold negative feelings towards you are just completely unreasonable and made up of air and nothing else. I find that doing that, I get to pull myself together and stop the fear. Hope you find it useful ‚ù§Ô∏è"
sex,fih788v,t3_f7p0mh,1582407219.0,"What a jackass. Don't get me wrong, jokes and laughs in the bedroom are cool and can be useful to relax and break the ice sometimes, but is not ok to manipulate the situation and you into thinking you're ""too sensitive"". I think your reaction was normal. He made you feel self-conscious and insecure, and he didn't even apologize or take back his hurtful comment. And this whole ultimatum thing of ""don't ruin sex for me"" and ""I rather be single"" is vain and inconsiderate. He didn't even show concern about what your feelings are. 
I reckon it would be cool to talk about it. Let him know how you feel, how he made you feel. And tell him its not ok to throw around this threats/ultimatums. You are not overreacting and you're not wrong in feeling insecure. Don't let him put that on you.

relationships,fh6fotl,t3_f1b3zh,1581298352.0,"In my opinion this dude is just blaming all this on you so he doesn't feel guilty for wanting to break up. In a relationship everything is split, everything is on both parts. It's clearly healthier to stay broken up, but it's definitely not all on you. Yes, you've made mistakes. No, you shouldn't have texted M. But he's done his part too. He didn't prioritize fixing the relationship or spending time together, and also what's up with the whole dismissing you like you meant nothing to him? I think it'd be cool for you to get closure by clearing things up between you two. If he doesn't want to talk and you continue to be blocked, I guess a good option might be writing a letter and handing it to one of his friends or a member of his family, so that they can give it to him. I reckon getting back together is no longer an option, plus it's not healthy. Nevertheless, closing that chapter by getting it all out of your system, would be a good next step."

Please don't perpetuate this, you deserve better. And don't fool yourself, it's not love to stick with him and it's not safe in any way."
AskMen,fh5gx4g,t3_f18v92,1581288923.0,"In my opinion it totally depends on each friendship, meaning you should think about what would come off as weird between you and a particular friend since I don't think there's a general rule to apply. Maybe think about all the things you could say if your intention was to pick her up and don't say any of them. Nevertheless, if you're close friends and there's trust between you two, there wouldn't be reason for her to think it's weird to be complemented, regardless of what you say."
