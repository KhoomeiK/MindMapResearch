\- Joe Biden has a history of overstepping his bounds when dealing with women

Elizabeth Warren is affiliated with them, meaning that her team approves the content of each ad (and the COO of the PAC was previous a member of a fossil fuel advocacy lobby). Read the article I linked for a detailed explanation of why the situations are different. 

Regardless, my problem stands: she reversed her position on a key issue concerning campaign finance because her campaign is currently struggling to get votes and raise money. I like Elizabeth Warren, I'm not your enemy, but I am disappointed in her decision on this issue. I'm going to step away from this conversation for now if that's cool because I've had what I have to say.

There are more distinctions, too. You can read about them here: [https://readsludge.com/2020/02/10/fact-check-does-bernie-sanders-get-support-from-big-money-super-pacs/](https://readsludge.com/2020/02/10/fact-check-does-bernie-sanders-get-support-from-big-money-super-pacs/)

ElizabethWarren,fj7cde6,t1_fj7bpmi,1583089528.0,"Sorry, I see why my comment is a little unclear. Bernie does not approve of any advertisements put out by that group (""I approve this message""). Think of it like his endorsement from the Sunrise Movement — they put out lots of pro-Sander's content, but none of it is endorsed or run through any member of Sanders' team. That isn't the case for the PAC currently supporting Warren. Any amount of PAC money is wrong, and her reversal on this issue is particularly concerning to me.
