Homebrewing,fkf0i0a,t3_fhypbc,1584124534.0,Correction I said Dollar General apple juice but it is actually Walmart great value.
Homebrewing,fkf0ewt,t3_fhypbc,1584124481.0,"I used the brand fleishmann active dry yeast and great value able juice, sorry it took me so long to reply. Is it possible I could add sugar and let it set longer and it taste better? Because like it is now, to me it is undrinkable. I also read I could add brown sugar and that would help, have y’all heard that?"
Homebrewing,fke3ocj,t1_fke23kk,1584104327.0,Yes it’s very abrasive tasting
Homebrewing,fke3m52,t3_fhypbc,1584104280.0,"I used 100 percent apple juice from dollar general and a packet of active dry yeast from Walmart, the kind that comes with 3 packs. I used 1 full pack after pouring about 4 oz out to make room, i placed the top on, shook well. Then placed a balloon as the lid and let it sit in the closet for 7 days."
cats,fkb8ujj,t1_fkarnuq,1584028419.0,Yep lol my thought as well
Homebrewing,fk3z39l,t1_fk3vkbi,1583849774.0,Not not yet but come Friday I will try the first one I made. I hate I didn’t use sugar I feel like it’s gonna taste awful but the original recipe I went with didn’t call for it. But now the majority I read calls for sugar to be added. I’ll give an update on how it turned out. Fingers crossed
Homebrewing,fk3uobb,t1_fk3sbpz,1583846722.0,It was me. What did I do wrong? I’m still learning.
