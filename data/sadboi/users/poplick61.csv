AskReddit,fh4irq8,t1_fh4fm45,1581279079.0,"You're right that people shouldn't compare themselves to how people represent themselves online, but the reason I got heated about your comment was that it seemed to devalue the importance of the premise the initial question presented. It's important for the issue of depression and mental health be destigmatized so people can be more open with how they feel and get the help they need. Social media is one of the outlets people use to do so. 

I admire your commitment to being disconnected from social media, but this question wasn't the best choice to try to get people to see your side of that particular issue. The people reading the answers might be trying to find the will to live, and criticism of their outlets for self help is probably not the best idea. I apologize for the way I came off in my initial reply. My intention wasn't to discredit your opinion, I just felt maybe you should've expressed that opinion somewhere else."
AskReddit,fh4drd3,t1_fh4997w,1581277690.0,"Well it can get better. It's hard to help people when you're not qualified to do so, but I still want to give my two cents. There's not much of a method yet beyond medication to combat depression, since talking about it doesn't do much, but if you hold out long enough, you will start to see an upturn in life. If you don't have anyone to get you through your darker hours, there's nothing wrong with getting through it for prides sake, or for the sake of those you love or lost. I'm happy that you feel that it's not meant to happen, because you're right. You're needed in this world. You might not see what for, but you have empathy and can use that to help people."

AskReddit,fh46t1e,t1_fh43i9q,1581275793.0,"You realize depression is the most common form of mental illness, right? There's no issue in venting online where people feel the same way you do. This question is meant to help people in a dark place thinking of killing themselves, and all you can think to respond with is criticism. It's not always as easy as ""just talk to real people"" or ""make real friends"". Any form of socializing is better than not socializing at all. I think maybe you should hold your tongue and consider the point of view of someone trying to seek help. And if you think it's so terrible that people are on reddit instead of socializing in the real world, what forced you to make an account and reply to this question with such cynicism?"
AskReddit,fh43acp,t3_f18upu,1581274839.0,"I made a personal promise years ago. Whenever I feel that life isn't ""going so great"" and I feel like ending it all, I think back to that promise and decide to stick it out and try to see what will happen next, good or bad. If the guilt of doing something like that to my family doesn't do it for me, the curiosity of what could come next does. In times of depression, I usually just let whatever happens happen without actively trying to let something kill me because not only would I be breaking that promise, but I wouldn't be able to see what happens next. 

This isn't advice to keep anyone from self harm or self destructive behavior, though I hope someone is able to use my method to their advantage. It's just what helps me personally."
