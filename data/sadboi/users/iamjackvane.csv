I wash or change my PJ’s, night mask, and pillow cases maybe once a week for cleanliness, and sheets probably once a month (which probably isn’t great). And workout gear: I’ll usually wear the same bottoms a couple times before washing them, since they’re just gonna get sweaty again anyway, but I always change the tops and do a sniff test of the bottoms if working out in a class setting. Hope this helps!

Edit: My favorite trick for jeans, jackets, coats, and other outerwear or things you don’t want to/can’t wash too often or between dry-cleaning: spray with vodka! I always have cheap vodka in a spray bottle around that I use to deodorize and freshen things up. Works great for scarves and hats in the winter that you wear daily and can’t wash too often, for example. Costumers on Broadway do this with costumes :) and no, it won’t make you smell like alcohol... vodka is odorless!"

Aquariums,flo0xir,t3_fnfsur,1585329589.0,"Goldfish—looking to upgrade! (Lots of dumb questions coming your way) 

We were fish newbs, and as many start off, we won a fair fish and assumed a bowl was fine. Learned quickly that it was not, and splurged on a 3 gallon take which I thought was such a great setup, especially in the confines of our small apartment space. Upon doing more research, I learned that this may have been suitable for other types of fish, but not goldfish. My husband and I decided today that after nine months and a fish who has grown and is clearly not goin’ anywhere (yay!) it is time to upgrade. I’ve read that 10 gallons is the minimum for one goldfish. So, my main questions are 1. is 10 gallons actually good, or if I’m already making the investment and the extra space for it, should we be going even bigger? What’s actually ideal? 2. if we want our fishy to have a friend, what’s the minimum size to upgrade to? We’re not married to the idea of getting a second fish, but if it were plausible to do that and only have to upgrade to 15 gallons, for instance, we’d definitely go for it. But, we want to be responsible fish parents and we’re more committed to making the life of the fish we already have better and healthier!

Secondary questions—if we were to get a second fish, should it be a goldfish, or would some kind of algae-eating fish help the goldfish conundrum? Also cleaning—what the hell? Everything I look up about cleaning a tank says you can’t use any type of soap, so I don’t really know how to do a deep clean."

If I start eating first thing in the morning, I’ll eat that much several times throughout the day and still be just as hungry for dinner. Adds up."
