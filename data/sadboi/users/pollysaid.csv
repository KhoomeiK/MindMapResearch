MarioKartTour,fqgerum,t1_fqd148b,1589344420.0,I once got four frenzies in Koopa Troopa Beach R/T last tour. Green shell and three coin. I think one was from an item ticket. Used Gold Koopa Lvl 3.

SuicideWatch,fofsak7,t3_g6qx7q,1587741936.0,I got this book on Amazon for intrusive obsessive thoughts that is helping. Put in ‚Äúovercoming unwanted intrusive thoughts by sally winston‚Äù and it‚Äôs the first listing to come up. Topics talked about are similar to what you and others commenting are going through. I highly recommend it. If you can‚Äôt afford it I bet a pdf could be tracked down.

MarioKartTour,fnucjzs,t3_g3yxyy,1587259133.0,Had an amusing exchange with my mom and was using the image for context. Sorry if it‚Äôs not allowed.
MarioKartTour,fnuc8g4,t3_g3yxyy,1587258943.0,"Poor Mom. She often asks how the game is going so I told her I was working on the challenge and how they were ‚Äúsnowpeople‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsnowmen.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt realize I had to hit them and was genuinely sad about it. Not sure why she thought I‚Äôd be taking them out for drinks in a racing game, but that look of shock and sadness was indescribable and a little heartbreaking. She then speculated I was going to post this on the internet."
MarioKartTour,fnjw2xw,t1_fnj3jlp,1587008367.0,Completely misunderstood what you were saying.
MarioKartTour,fnj0i2b,t1_fnidvje,1586989673.0,Yes they are. Click Details next Reset for a pipe. It tells you the appearance rates and quantity by rarity. This person would have the High End row completely 1/1.

MarioKartTour,fk8w00k,t3_fh50f2,1583963953.0,I had that last night. I played two courses of a cup for the first time in multiplayer and when I went to single player the third didn‚Äôt appear. I played the second course again as single player and it popped up.
MarioKartTour,fk8cerq,t3_fgzy3s,1583953446.0,"It was really frustrating getting the rubies 3 at a time because you‚Äôd end up with an uneven amount. 
In regards to the star tickets, I think this ties into being able to buy the item packs multiple times since the $2 one has has a few."
MarioKartTour,fk7lv0k,t1_fk7ei3j,1583939099.0,You are a genius.
MarioKartTour,fk7jcvb,t1_fk6qr6r,1583937656.0,I usually buy the $2 one because it‚Äôs the best deal.

MarioKartTour,fjykqhd,t1_fjyjk0q,1583698849.0,Yes and she‚Äôs very bored. I keep catching her off guard so we‚Äôll see what happens.
MarioKartTour,fjxxsz3,t3_ffdwwf,1583685799.0,32.5k Tier 30 2nd place. 34.1k is 1st and 30.8k is 3rd. I know I won‚Äôt get 1st but am trying to get high enough not to be bumped down to 3rd.
MarioKartTour,fjnomf3,t1_fjmpv45,1583511601.0,Sometimes that‚Äôs available when installing an update.

MarioKartTour,fi4eytn,t1_fi4e0br,1582139837.0,It‚Äôs so messed up that they are the same.  It‚Äôs frustrating enough that countless pulls later one often doesn‚Äôt get a spotlight.
MarioKartTour,fi2rzk4,t1_fi25ujl,1582087395.0,Yep! New York Tour.

MarioKartTour,fhy7iyd,t3_f5br85,1581970224.0,"15/15, 16/23, 7/26 gold pass since launch."
MarioKartTour,fhbl8vo,t3_f2acnq,1581444583.0,"However how ‚Äúwider variety of courses‚Äù part is true. Earlier this week I noticed I was only going up a level or so a week even though I played for hours each day since launch, coming in 1st or 2nd most times, and was jumping around.  Needed to get to Level 30 to complete the challenge card so I went fuck it and purposely raced through the different levels with the intent of coming in first constantly, not race points. Started with T courses because they hadn‚Äôt been around long enough for me to max out and then jumped around to the others. I vastly switched them up each time. Level 29 to 30 in one day of grinding. Now I get at least 1% each time I come in first regardless of what course. (This probably wasn‚Äôt worded the best so feel free to ask me questions to clarify.)
Now if you are at a higher level I am aware your experience will not be the same. I don‚Äôt think I have fully maxed out any level yet. I‚Äôm just sharing my experience."
MarioKartTour,fh83p1o,t3_f1i58a,1581351336.0,The item packs aren‚Äôt even worth it. I bought the $20 one because I‚Äôve wanted Shy Guy Pastry Chef since Paris tour and the pull was only normals. Did 51 pulls and only got one HE so far. For $20 I‚Äôd like to get more than normals and an item that‚Äôs only good for that tour. Such a rip off. Plus a bunch of the levels that have heart balloons as tier 3 also have the strawberry crepe glider as tier 3 as well.

MarioKartTour,ffw11gr,t1_ffw0uoq,1580279884.0,No it wouldn‚Äôt go beyond 6 or beyond the max amount of points. It would go up to the max.
MarioKartTour,ff9r12v,t1_ff9oxb5,1579719149.0,Yep! I‚Äôve been playing since launch day and it‚Äôs been hard to keep track of them due to how many there are. Price or what they were bundled with‚Äîlike tickets or rubies‚Äîisn‚Äôt important.
shortcuts,fdi8p7q,t1_f1mzxlw,1578437741.0,I‚Äôm struggling with this as well.
