EatingDisorders,fqcfsh7,t1_fqaso5p,1589257124.0,"Thank you so much. My therapist really is wonderful - same line of thinking as you. Set boundaries, have courage to stand behind the boundaries, and use self-soothing techniques when I get upset about her response/lack of response."
EatingDisorders,fqcfgfr,t1_fqbyto7,1589256899.0,"Thank you for your thoughtful insight - also, Iâ€™m crying laughing at the spray bottle! ðŸ’¦"
EatingDisorders,fqa6vkz,t1_fq9c8h5,1589213872.0,"I love this advice. I agree wholeheartedly that therapy would help her navigate her struggles. 

Any advice on how to communicate those boundaries? Often when I try, she will respond by saying how I am rejecting her love and concern and she just wants me to be beautiful. Even when I tell her that itâ€™s hurtful, she says she thinks the ends justifies the means. Would love any insight or advice!"
