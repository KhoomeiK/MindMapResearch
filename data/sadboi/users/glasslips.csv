I feel like the other part of the time, I end up trying to redeem myself for my reckless or stupid behavior during the rocky times. It's such a vicious cycle."
Pets,fqlgzqj,t3_gjgx27,1589457841.0,"A friend of mine had their dog eat a rib bone while I was visiting. 

From my understanding, dogs stomach acid may be able to break it down and process it. My friend just had to watch her dog and make sure she pooped the next few days. Also keeping note of eating habits. I think one of the major issues is if the bone bad been chewed and then cutting their esophagus if I remember correctly. I'd call a vet and see what they say. The pupper I referred to did just fine and didn't have any issues.. They didn't need to take her to the vet, but it was scary! 

I hope your baby is okay"
