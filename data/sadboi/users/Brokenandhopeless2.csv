BPD,f5r5oc1,t3_dorsg8,1572388560.0,"I've felt this way since my ex-fiance left me. Doing long distance took a horrible toll on me and she didn't like who I was  because I was stressed out, negative, and lonely. I never got the chance to go home and attempt to get better. It was just a lot of judgement from 1500 miles away and left me devastated. Since then I have no real interest in dating cause I don't trust a soul anymore and I feel like if I do fall for someone they'll just do the same to me. Its crazy but I feel like its almost like a type of PTSD."
BPD,f59ama8,t3_dnaeuw,1572079813.0,"My fiance broke up with me via text ( we were doing long distance at the time) an then cut communication off completely. I've been a f'n wreck ever since; especially, cause I started educating myself further on BPD and started finding out a ton of information I never knew about it that was likely causing a lot of issues we were having. I've tried repeatedly to try to talk to her about all of it but its all been for not. She treats me like I'm nothing and I don't know how to move on from it. I feel like cutting me out like I was nothing to her made it so much worse; especially, when I didn't know what splitting was or how the unsteady and inconsistent lifestyle I was making myself live in CA was triggering the hell out of me and was making me negative and hopeless about everything.  It just sucks because my counselors never told me about any of this stuff so I never had a clue what to look out for and instead have another failed relationship in my life as a result."

movies,f0e0r2o,t1_f0dn519,1568561469.0,"Is it though? It's a work of fiction, if people are too simple minded to not be able to tell the difference between fiction and fact, than that's on them. Its a pro American war film so cheesy dialogue like that is gonna be used a bunch. It's a Roland Emmerich film so the screenplay and film should have low expectations."
movies,f0c3a94,t1_f02ixhh,1568535162.0,That was a fear back in those days. Its easy to say its ridiculous now but people were scared after the attack on Pearl.
movies,f0c2krj,t1_f0139eb,1568534908.0,Simple its not finished and they usually are working on the final cut of the film until a week or two before its release. There's numerous films that do this.
movies,f0c2b3f,t1_f02q7cy,1568534810.0,"We definitely get the Doolittle Raid in this. I think we're following certain characters on the 3 carriers. Some were on Enterprise during the Doolittle Raid, and I think the opening shot is a Yorktown Class carrier. Not Lexington like someone mentioned. The towers look completely different."
BPD,f0bxvyb,t3_d47pxj,1568533215.0,"Thank you. They definitely make some weird choices.

&#x200B;

My doctors kept my diagnosis from me for 6 years because they felt I was too high risk for self harm. I didn't find out I had BPD until I was almost 30 and didn't truly get the proper education on it until I started reading books on it last year after my fiance left me. Really makes me wonder how my life would be different if I had gotten the education on it and its treatment way earlier in life."
BPD,ez6xr5n,t1_ez6s2pg,1567716367.0,Same!!!
BPD,eykf2d5,t3_cxd0wr,1567148308.0,"Happened to me last April when my fiance broke up with me through a text and then wouldn't talk to me on the phone or let me  come see her to talk things out. We were doing long distance and I wasn't as knowledged in BPD as I am now and was in a bad place mentally. Didn't know what splitting or mirroring were, didn't know how important good environments are so I was in a bad way. On top of that I was 1500 miles from the love of my life. When she decided to have enough I' fell apart and am still a mess. I see myself as a shell now as well and am so alone. This disorder is such a nightmare and I hate how important it is to constantly aware I have to be now because I don't trust a thing I do or  say. Most of the time now, I just it in my place and do nothing. I've never experienced these kinda lows before but I don't wish it on anyone."
MarvelStudiosSpoilers,ey2frct,t1_ey1mv8v,1566738130.0,except there's footage of Scarlett in it.
BPD,exv8xjp,t3_cu077z,1566594844.0,Yup and my ex finally had enough cause I would vocalize it instead of  communicating my feelings. I didn't know much about BPD at the time and couldn't explain why it was happening. Now I know its a common BPD trait and instead of shutting down and giving her the silent treatment afterwards I should have done a better job communicating my concerns or  thoughts.
BPD,excp9bl,t1_exc487o,1566156215.0,"That's how I kinda feel too. I don't know who I am. I'm lacking such a sense of identity and I try to be like how I think my ex is and it has helped me to a point because I've been able to abandon a lot of the faults I had from my time in California. However, it doesn't seem to matter cause Im all alone without a sense of direction on where to take my life now. This disorder is nuts."
BPD,exayvua,t3_crwd56,1566119001.0,"I've been dealing with this for over a year. Lost interest in everything I used to enjoy and can't stop thinking about her every day. We were doing super long distance and it, among other things I was dealing with on my end tore me apart. The guilt and disgust I carry and have for myself still seems intense af. I have no idea how to make it stop. I've educated myself so much on BPD and I see what needs to happen to do well but of course love and life doesn't work that easily."
BPD,exaya36,t3_crvrr4,1566118638.0,"Yup, moved to a new town for the 4th time in the last year and that doesnt include a homeless stint. All have been to different states so I don't know anyone where I'm at, I don't really wanna date cause I'm not over my ex who broke up with me last year and I'm just hopelessly lonely. I don't go out or anything, I just work and then stay home. I don't know what to do."
movies,eu73981,t1_es6gk4j,1563516568.0,Seriously though! I wasn't that bothered by it. Its a proven fact that they can improve the effects greatly in several months. I'm excited for it.
marvelstudios,eteqa8w,t1_etedx7p,1562742049.0,That's exactly what happened. They didn't have the time to polish the CGI.
BPD,eq8nqe0,t3_bxldpa,1559870192.0,I'm the absolute worst when I'm splitting. I want to start arguments over the dumbest shit. I hate it.
