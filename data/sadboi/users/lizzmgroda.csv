Sometimes, apparently, your ribs can slip out of place if you have a strong enough muscle spasm.

Guess who had a muscle spasm while picking up a jar of pasta sauce.

That injury ended up costing me a raise and had me out of work for a solid month."

The link to the LGBT+ started a long time ago with NAMBLA and other shitty groups that are similar. It's hard to give a firm answer on why anyone does anything.... But from what I understand, finding a community is hard for these people. The online communities for a long time were pedophiles trying to support each other's feelings. Now non-offending MAPs have a better support system because we know more about why MAPs offend and therefore help THEM understand the damage sexual abuse has on minors. 
There's so much more info out there. You just have to have an open, understanding view and do research."
trashy,ey8ce1p,t1_ey71de9,1566916808.0,"There are a lot of different ways to go about this. Research has shown that trauma experienced at a young age can cause an emotional / sexual attraction to children of that same age. If this is the case, research has also shown that addressing that trauma can lead to these feelings changing.
There is also research to support the idea that being an MAP is similar to an orientation, but it is based on age. There are so many ways this can manifest too. Some people are only attracted to one age group. Some are attracted to people their own age and minors of different ages. 
Because people just want to lock this population away, we don't really know how to address a lot of this. What we do know is that these people NEED SUPPORT. The public does not need to accept their feelings towards children, but we need to accept that they are fucking human and need help. They need understanding.

The Prevention Podcast interviews MAPs of all ages and types to help it's listener understand. I highly recommend giving it a listen.

Im going to school to eventually study this population, so I could discuss this topic for hours."

Before getting crazy upset and worrying about ending a LTR you should maybe bring this up as a concern for HIS health."
