What I find about self hatred is there's a love in it. A sweet love in kicking ourselves when we're down. Humans are strange. 

Focus on you're writing and challenge your self to write about as many emotions as you can. It's a good way to understand yourself. Puts distance between the ego and self.

But you could try talking him into the next stage of grief. It will take time. walk him and talk him to what lies behind the anger. I find most negitive emotions are born from misunderstanding ie. Why is this happening to me? What I understand about death and the sadness of it is that love wants to continue with no place but memory to project. 

Give him the task of writing a letter to you or the deceased. Let him know you'll be there. Acceptance is hard. But bares fruit.

Try smiling at the haters, love yourself regardless of opinion.

I suffer similarly with voices telling me I'm hated. Not just hated but truly despised.

My answer is to keep the love alive. Keep my mind positive. It's what the Buddhist call metta. Kindness for those that dislike, hate, or are enemies of ourselves.

schizophrenia,ewnns6h,t3_cp75d7,1565583916.0,"Something that helps me is remembering that it's not life I want to end but the suffering and drudgery. You have one very amazing ability. You can love through adversity. A little thing I do is imagine a door. It's the door to your heart. Imagine it opening. And a light coming from within it. If you can't open that door, I say to myself it's okay. All the people I love are safe inside. Then I visualise the people I love safe and at home in my heart room.

It might sound stupid, but works for me.

Another thing I use is a little eastern philosophy (actually all this is eastern👍) . Every person has Buddha's heart. Your heart, the human heart is the same one as a being known for his ultimate compassion and massive love for all life. This is the truth and potential of you and your very flawed loving self. A being of love. If there is suffering, the answer is love. Like your mum kissing your knee when you fall over.

I'll bring up one more thing. Stop loving with condition. Especially yourself! Stop setting conditions for happiness. No more, when a and b happen, then I'll be happy. End the reward system of love and happiness. No conditions. I WILL LOVE. No, when I do this or that. Now! 

Thank you. And much love to you. Let your heart free.

Meditation really helped me. I consider prayer a kind of meditation. Try just watching without reacting. Just watch. No thoughts and detach from your fear. Become impersonal with yourself and the voices. Become an observer for 5 mins everyday. If you can I believe you'll see a difference.
