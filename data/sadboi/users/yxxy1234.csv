The people who valued looks have mostly ended up either pregnant, unhappy or grew up and learnt that a human being is more then just aesthetics.

Devaluing yourself to just your looks is like saying you're nothing but a product on a shelf.

You are more then that, so much more.

Perhaps what you want is release, not death specifically.

So how can we facilitate a feeling of release, without inducing harm?

Dopamine and serotonin would be our first chemical friends to play with.

Antidepressants (IF YOU NEED THEM) can be a short-term godsend. I take 10mg of lexapro, and man. I hate the shit. But it helps. A lot.

Walking will induce dopamine, (using it to help against my addiction withdrawals)l, trust me its true).
Exercise in general. 

LEARNING THINGS REALLY HELPS. A stimulated body and mind are often percursors to a happy individual. You may have been self caring, but have you tried STIMULATING yourself. FEELING alive??

So you going to an ex is NATURAL and normal, as you two were obviously very close and you felt a level of safety with her.
Although, i can see the issue.

Talk to her, explain how she makes your feelings feel invalidated but make THAT conversation feel safe, not accusatory, EXPLAIN for her, in a way she may understand for herself what you're trying to say

Would we escape the dinosaurs by being sad and whatnot??

But in todays day and age, the need for aggression has really lessened and the need for communication has really increased.

When you get angry, do you struggle to say what you feel, without exploding?
Or do you ""lash out"" and get a bit nasty (my problem personally)

What i found, is learning new words and expanding our vocabulary can really help us communicate what we need to without resorting to using our body language and volume and aggression to illustrate the severity of what we are feeling.

The next step is staying calm enough to say these new words, having emotional talks while on a walk can really help. I find just a little bit of movement can really help channel all.that excess energy away from our words and actions, and into our feet.

YES! It is definitely  addictive.

I wouldn't say it's like alcohol or opiod addiction (my mother was an alcoholic, uncle an amphetamine user),

But YES, HELL YES. especially when smoked in conjunction with tobacco.

You got this.

All i can suggest is to pretend you have the flu really bad, take 3-4 days off from life, and lock yourself in a comfortable place and just let your body clean itself out.

Yeah i've checked out leaves, but it can be hard to maintain social contact on forums when you're in the thick of it (at least for me :p)

I sometimes go and read success stories when i'm really struggling. If that fails, something to induce a dopamine release (hot chocolate and a walk or something).

Just remember. So long as you dont ingest these substances, your brain WILL heal. Dont let yourself compromise, ever, not even a little bit.

Be strong <3 i dont know who you are or where you are, but from one human being to another. You are making the right choice, and are setting an example for the people who come after us, be the person that addicted ""you"" needed at their worst."

Anxiety,f31y2ep,t1_f31m7tk,1570587851.0,"Hey! I used to be on lexapro myself, heavy weed user.

It DEFINITELY interacts, i refuse to take my medication without quitting weed now.

In my experience, the first two weeks it made me feel pretty gone (but i was sober) once weed was introduced, all positive effects really seemed to go, but the negative ones crept up on me over the 8 months

My PERSONAL!!!!! symptoms, were erectile dysfunction, or just it worked but man was it hard to reach the finale.

I was ALWAYS tired, like zombie tired. You get used to it and normalize it in your head, but once i quit lexapro, i was amazed at how the fog i hadn't noticed was there, made a huge impact.

I LOST weight, but i was in an active gym routine. So cant say for sure it was from the medication.

Sleep became a PROPER chore, but ive always had sleeping issues from nicotine and coffee abuse.

For all of that said, it really REALLY helped me in the short term. In my sober state, id say once i had it with a morning coffee, it felt like a mild MDMA dose for me personally.

Id feel jittery, giddy, excited (emotionally and..intimately) energetic (at the start of the meds)
100% ready for the morning.

Not sure if any of this interests or helps you, but it was my experience of lexapro sober vs lexapro as a regular pot smoker. (Up to 3.5G a day, illegal country)."
