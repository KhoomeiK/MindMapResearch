I grew up in a household where you made verbal acknowledgements to the person speaking as they told their story.  Family members, we all know what the other's going to say, so we just finish each other's sentences.  If someone's wrong, we correct the mistake and move on with collectively telling the story.

Little did I know that my husband grew up in a household where power, control and domination were dictated by being capable of talking louder and LOUDER AND LOUDER to crush out any dissension by the listener.

So I apparently ""interrupt"".  example: ""Once upon a time, there was a big castle.  \_""It's in Moldavia."" \_""YOU INTERRUPTED ME!  AGAIN!  YOU DON'T RESPECT ME!"" ""Uh no. I mean yes?  I was showing you that I was listening!"" ""shut up when I'm talking then, and just listen."""

PersonalFinanceCanada,fqq8cmq,t1_fqpwiii,1589561132.0,"It's pretty simple.  Deferment is simply extending the **contract** you have with the bank.  There is no saving money, or paying less to the bank in this scenario.

If you defer now, you will have to pay a higher interest rate in the future, when the rates rise again (if you have a variable rate or when the mortgage term renews on your fixed rate).  Especially since the deferred interest on the principal amount is still going to stack up behind the scenes and then SURPRISE!  You owe RBC the same money that you owed them in the beginning... except that they will have increased the  interest rate by then, so you'll actually owe MORE.

ELI5: Pretend you have BIG BIG mortgage, with 2.6% +prime, and you have 5 years to pay on that type of payment plan.  in 5 years, let's pretend the banks raise prime rates to say, 2% higher.  So you go to renew, and you're told that the new payment plan is 3.9% + prime interest (which is now 2% higher than it was).  Do some simple math - ***you will never pay less in interest unless you get the mortgage principal*** (that BIG BIG number) ***much lower than it is.***

Think of it like a really big credit card.  Do you want that card to be at 35% interest or do you want to be loaned money at 19.99999998%  ?

Just keep making your payments as usual.  This interest rate is probably the lowest you'll get on this loan for quite some time.  The only reason that RBC approved the deferment for you is because they feel that you are capable of paying the loan back in full.

This is why banks don't like people paying down their mortgages as fast as possible.  They typically get to raise the interest rates on people at least 3-4 times in a typical mortgage because hardly anyone has the cash flow to pay a whole mortgage plus the fee for paying it off early, within 5 years."

I think you have answered yourself right here.  and you state you have already spent months doing that.

my small person spilled a drink on a laptop after she was set up at the desk with very specific places for beverages and taped-down cords, etc.  it took her 2 years to earn our trust again to be allowed to sit in front of a laptop and control it herself, beverage or not.
