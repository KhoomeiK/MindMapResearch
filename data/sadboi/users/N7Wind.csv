HealthAnxiety,fmcta9k,t3_fue3ni,1585952408.0,"Hmm, this question is hard to answer.

Personally, I do get leg pain once in a while. However, it's always caused by my anxiety. When I'm anxious or otherwise highly stressed, I have the tendency to tense my muscles which eventually causes painful stabbing/shooting pain. I didn't know I was causing it until I noticed this.

This might be what's causing your leg pain.  You might be unknowingly tensing your muscles everytime you feel anxious causing that horrible pain you feel. 

Regardless, I can't diagnose you over the Internet. No one can, we can only throw guesses at you. However, I don't think that your leg pain is serious. Leg pain rarely is but it can also be caused by a blood clot in a deep vein. However, if your leg is not swollen or hasn't changed in color, then you have nothing to worry about. My mom once got a blood clot on her leg and it was completely red (almost purple) and very swollen. She could barely walk or do anything and was in intense pain. If you had one you'd know for sure."

You could be infected without any symptoms for a few days.

Regardless, 88% is still a very large percentage of people, meaning that you could use that symptom as a base for diagnosis. Obviously, not the most accurate method but unless you have Dyspnea (Shortness of Breath) , you should be fine and have nothing to worry about.

The so called ''white light'' when someone dies or has a NDE is one of the most commonly reported phenomenons.

astrology,fiog9mt,t3_f8uhbx,1582582698.0,"Neptune is the planet of dreams, illusions, poisons, gases, all drugs, alcohol, addiction, weakness, 
art, inspiration, spiritualism, indecision, confusion, deception, thieves, the ocean, liquids, sacrifice, dance, meditation, spirituality, religion, charity, entertainment,psychic phenomena, the unconscious, lies and victimisation. 

Neptune is where one is weak, undecided, prone to fantasy and impressionable.  People with a prominent Neptune in their birth charts are usually creative artists. Many singers have a prominent Neptune in their charts. It also gives psychic ability, though these people might not be even aware of it. Neptune dissolves. 

When properly placed in the birth chart, one is in tune with their emotions, one can express themselves freely and easily, flowing like water. With hard aspects or when there's too much emphasis of the planet's energy on the chart, ugly things can also manifest: Mental Disorders, neuroses, addiction, alcohol, drugs, lying, manipulating, stealing. Neptune can make the individual elusive and deceptive, prone to lying and dishonesty. They might even believe their own lies and have difficulty separating reality from fantasy. 

Also, people with a prominent Neptune in their birth charts are more prone to abuse certain substances such as alcohol, drugs or other psychedelics or mind altering substances. This is blatant in the entertainment industry. Many famous singers or artists abuse such substances. This is not exclusive to singers though. Athletes are also prone to this. Mars typically rules sports. However, hard aspects between Mars and Neptune can cause the same effect and lead the individual to abuse performance booster stimulants. 

I can also talk from personal experience. I have a prominent Neptune in my chart. Neptune in the 1st House, aspecting almost all of my planets. Most of my planets are either in the 1st House or 12th House. The ones that aren't located in those houses or aspecting Neptune are in Pisces (My Mars for example. Mars in my chart isn't aspecting Neptune or in the 12th house. However, it's in Pisces). I have my share of mental disorder such as Anxiety, Panic Disorder, OCD and depersonalization. It's not pretty and the temptation to drink my worries away or use drugs has always been there. 

In other words, yes. Neptune does rule drugs and mind altering substances. Even those associated with sports such as steroids."

**PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**

This is a hard question to answer. Anxiety can have its roots in many different causes and worries. Everyone is different and everyone who suffers from GAD or Panic Disorder has different ways to cope with it. Some people resort to medication such as Ativan (Lorazepam) to manage their symptoms. Others prefer to use natural or homeopathic remedies, though in my sincere opinion and experience, they don't help and are a massive fraud, akin to ''essential oils''. 

I'm not a psychologist, but I know that the therapist usually tries to find the core reason of what causes you worry. In some cases, the individual knows what is worrying him/her but not always. You might have hidden worries that you aren't consciously aware of, which delays the process of healing. Once the core of your worries is revealed, you have to work with it and face it. **This is the hard part.**

Personally, my panic attacks used to come out out of nowhere and with no previous warning. I thought there was no reason for me feeling this way but as I started analysing my problem, I discovered a pattern. All my panic attacks and anxiety arose in public places, rarely at home. Turns out I have agoraphobia (I feel in danger or unsafe in public unfamiliar places), which caused me great anxiety everytime I had to leave my home.

**I still haven't gotten over my anxiety. However, I found ways to cope with it without having to go to a therapist. I found meditation to help clear your mind. For me, I start to get anxious when I start to think about unpleasant thoughts such as death or when I start focusing on my symptoms like heart palpitations. Clearing your mind of negative thoughts will greatly help you with your anxiety. Like I've said, I still have anxiety but it's been a while since I've had a panic attack. Another thing that helps me is to acknowledge your anxiety. Don't fight it, accept it and convince yourself that you're 100% safe and that there's no logical reason for you to feel this way. There's no danger. Affirm this in your mind and breathe deeply. If this doesn't work, find a task. Finding something to do redirects your worries and energy to other things.**

I'm aware that this piece of advice is probably not very helpful, especially if you don't have any experience with anxiety/panic attacks. I have a friend that also deals with panic attacks and they can be very intense, much worse than mine but he gradually learned how to control it better. 

Regardless, if you still can't solve the problem on your own, or at least reduce your anxiety levels, it's a good idea to resort to cognitive behavioural therapy. If it's too extreme, the doctor might also prescribe medication to force you to calm down."

Jupiter is the major benefic and protector. It's in Jupiter where we get lucky breaks, and things go right in our lives. 

NATAL INTERPRETATION OF JUPITER IN CAPRICORN
When Jupiter is in Capricorn, Jupiter is in Fall and therefore placed in a very difficult placement. This placement weakens the protective and benefic nature of Jupiter, especially if adversely aspected by malefics. 

People with this placement usually make good managers and are naturals at being in positions of authority. Status is important to them and they have a strong need for the respect and 
recognition of their peers. They are usually liked by the people they work with. These people also dedicate a lot of time and effort into acquiring power and don't mind making the necessary 
sacrifices in obtaining it. Extremely ambitious, they can be cold and calculating inregards to others. They prefer to stick to traditions. 
This placement is known for those who work very hard. Jupiter in Capricorn also detests weakness. Any weaknesses they are aware of within themselves, they work diligently at overcoming. They are both very hard on themselves and expect the same thing from others. This aspect also adds a serious facet to one's personality.
Capricorn Jupiter individuals may also easily choose their career over family. Saturn rules the 10th house, the house of career so this placement might create an obsession with work, creating workaholics."

Needless to say that romantic relationships for me need to be stable and secure. It takes me a long time to trust someone but once that trust is gained, I can become very romantic and affectionate (Mars in Pisces). I don't like PDA though since it makes me uncomfortable. 

However, I will never, in any circumstance, enter a relationship with someone without making a detailed mental report of who the person is. I simply refuse to waste my time, energy and money with someone who is not worth it. I like people who have their act together, are responsible and mature but not to the point of being a snow ice King, I like someone who's caring. 

Also, one night stands are not for me. I would rather not have sex for the rest of my life than hook up with a stranger. Monogamy is extremely important to me and I think that sex is something that should only be shared with your partner, not someone I met on the Internet. Once I do enter a relationship however, it's for life. Or at least I try to make it that way. 

I only dated once and it ended when my partner was forced to move to another country. 
We both reached the conclusion that our relationship wouldn't last that way and we broke up. We're still friends though and I liked him a lot, still do but I had to move on.

I haven't been with anyone else because sincerely most people are simply repulsive to me. Because I don't trust people easily when it comes to relationships, I basically have to play games with them, you could see it as some kind of test. Terrible I know, but I need to know their intentions first. That's where most people fail though. People like to put on masks to cover up their flaws and less desirable attributes however putting up a mask everyday becomes exhausting to people and it's only a matter of time before it finally drops and their true colours come up to the surface.

1. You're 17 years old. It's highly unlikely that you'd get something like this that young. ALS is rarer than brain cancer and it usually occurs in older people. 

2. If it was, you'd know it because you wouldn't be able to walk or lift objects. Lifting your smartphone would be the hardest task in the world. 

3. I have the same symtoms as you. It's anxiety. I get tingling in my arms and legs too often and sometimes I feel weak. It's a common symptom of anxiety."
HealthAnxiety,f1r8zll,t3_da8x59,1569712652.0,"Yeah, it's normal. They are completely benign and not an STD like some people think. By the way, you likely had them your whole life, you just noticed it now. They do not cause any harm and are not contagious so don't worry about it.
Since they pose no harm to the individual, doctors don't usually prescribe any treatment options. It is possible to remove them though:

 - Cryosurgery.
 - Laser Surgery.
 - Radiation Surgery.

These methods are usually considered safe, but nothing is ever certain. If it bothers you that much, see a doctor and ask him about treatment options."
HealthAnxiety,f19qymc,t3_d86sv7,1569276518.0,"This exact thing has happened to me about a year ago. Everytime I went to the bathroom, there was always bright red blood in the stool. Now, I've always had hemorrhoids but I had never bleed this much before so I went to the doctor to run some tests. Thankfully, there was nothing wrong with me. 

However, my doctor did notice that I was lacking iron and pretty much every vitamin, especially Vitamin C, D and B12. The doctor prescribed me some vitamins, told me to eat more fibers and I had to get some injections but after that everything returned to normal and I actually stopped bleeding completely. 

Now, I'll be honest: I had a very bad diet. I usually just skipped breakfast and lunch because I simply  wasn't hungry and when I did eat something, it would usually be junk food without any kind of nutritional value.

Honestly, I doubt it you have cancer. It's very rare to occur in young people and even if that were the case, surely you would have more severe symtoms such as abdominal discomfort, dark red bleeding, pain, weight loss, diarrhoea. 

Regardless, you should still go to a doctor just in case (and also to clear your mind). But once again, it's likely nothing. In my case, I just had to eat healthier and more frequently."

If you're competent enough, you can use it to get to know yourself better. (No, most people don't really know themselves and sometimes do things that really don't make sense. Astrology is the key to knowing yourself.)

I don't want to change anything about my birth chart, because that would compromise my own personality. If it were possible to change your personal placements, you would start to act differently than you normally would and that's kinda scary to me because it wouldn't be me.

astrology,ezxfgr8,t3_d2w7hw,1568239151.0,"I would like to inform you that Saturn is a social planet, therefore affecting a whole generation of people. Since Saturn takes around 2 years and half to move on to the next sign, a lot of people will have Saturn in the same sign.

Also, I think it's important to point out that Saturn doesn't deal with attractions, love or relationships for that matter, at least not in the way you would think. Saturn is the planet of misfortune in our charts and where we experience suffering, loss, misery and problems in life. Saturn is all about restriction. 

Because of this, the only thing that Saturn might attract to your life is misery and problems in your love life, especially with hard aspects to Venus or if Saturn is located in 5th/7th House."
astrology,ez7gnsc,t3_czztwf,1567723469.0,"I've worked with both systems but I find the sidereal/vedic system extremely innacurate and flawed so I use tropical.
The reason why is because certain characteristics of the planets in the signs and other given 
information of the vedic system does not fit me my personality at all. My interpretations using the Vedic system were way off and didn't make any sense to me or reflected me in any way. 
This is true both natally and in Prediction. I couldn't anticipate any events correctly with it.
You're free to use whatever system you want but according to my experience, my readings were always incorrect with it, unlike with the tropical system."

Personally, I've never came across any ''astrology haters''. I know people who ''believe'' and don't ''believe'' in astrology but the ones that do ''believe'' in astrology are extremely ignorant concerning it.
I don't really talk about it with other people in real life since, well the moment I stop talking about their Sun sign and move on to other stuff such as planets, houses, aspects, astrology systems, fixed stars, progressions, transits, planetary returns and arcs, they start to give me confused looks.
Typical."

AskReddit,ez0ihuq,t3_czq9s0,1567637200.0,"This happened a few years ago in 2017 when I was still in High School but here's my story anyways. 
I like to read, which is sadly uncommon nowadays and when I'm focused on something I literally forget everything else. In High School, I had classes in the mornings and occasionally in the afternoons too. Because I lived far away from school, I had to have lunch at my school cafetaria and spent whatever time I had left in school until classes start.
This happened in a Wednesday and I had classes from 2:25PM to 4:55PM and then I could go home. In that same afternoon I had a Biology Test. 
That day, I was reading a history book about Ancient Greece at my school library. I was so into it that I actually read half of it when I realized what had just happened. While I was reading, for some reason I decided to check my phone and when I looked it I froze. I still remember the exact time 3:19PM. That biology class (When I was supposed to do the test) had already ended and my Math class was about to begin in just 6 minutes. Thankfully my biology teacher was really understanding and I was able to do the test later but that experience was really scary for me."

 - Downvoting a comment just because they have a different opinion from you. I rarely downvote comments unless it's extremely offensive or rude. Arguments don't have to involve profanity and/or insults (ad hominem), which by the way aren't valid forms of argument, they're fallacies.

 - Well written and articulated posts/comments rarely get recognition. I used to take 30 minutes to write an educated and articulated opinion but then I realized that it's just not worth the effort, hence why I stopped writing and actually deleted some of them.

 - How easily someone can misinterpret you and twist your words in order to make your argument seem weaker than it is (Straw Man fallacy).
Example: I'm often accused of racism because I don't support illegal immigration."
