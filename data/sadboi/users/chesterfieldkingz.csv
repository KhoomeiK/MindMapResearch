I spent so many years pouring through Silver Jews albums and there's few artists that reached me lyrically like him.

HoMM,fpdf0dg,t1_fpdbqxx,1588525699.0,"6 has great graphics and a much better storyline with a lot of beautiful cutscenes in the campaign. There are actual boss fights where your army takes on one giant enemy that are pretty cool and the AI seems better than in 7. 6 also has a new faction called the Sanctuary which is cool. 6 tried some new skills and other ideas which is cool but unfortunately I felt like the new skills tended to make things a little unbalanced and the gameplay can suffer a little bit for it.

6 and 7 are pretty much opposites, honestly. 7 seems like it was made on a shoestring budget, the graphic are meh and the story is everyone telling stories which feels a little lazy especially since there are next to zero cut scenes. Where 6 tried new things 7 feels more like more of a slight tweak on some of the original ideas. That being said 7's gameplay is more balanced and just seems to flow better aside from some rather poor AI. Gameplay is pretty important so they end up coming out about equal in playability for me.

Sooooo basically, it depends on what you value in Heroes. Neither are as good as 3 or 5 probably,  but after I'd kind of blown those up and needed something new I enjoyed both of them. I must have paid around 20 for both complete versions and its way more than worth that price. I wouldn't pay the new price probably but they're on sale all the time and totally worth coming into with tempered expectations."
HoMM,fpd6fhs,t1_fpczj9k,1588520804.0,"The story does suck, Heroes 6 story is much better. That being said the game play is probably better than 6.

nfl,fp7l2vk,t1_fp73e0a,1588372655.0,I tend to agree with most of what you're saying. I do think we don't know everything and there's a possibility Trent shares some blame. I don't agree Redskins fans all agree with you though. There's a ton that berate Williams and basically say everything we don't know happened exactly as the organization said
nfl,fp6eggl,t1_fp6cr6q,1588350935.0,Ya I'd have to look into it more but they supposedly did tell him to see a doctor about that at some point. I'm not entirely sure what happened though so that could have just been the team backpedaling after the fact.
