Love and hate relationship since I grew up. Also a lot of times she'd tell me (I was 8 earliest I can remember) that I acted a lot like the parent than the child. What a fucked up thing to say to a kid. I think all I did was just pat her head and be calm a lot of the times at things she couldn't be calm of. 

In the end she did die. From cancer. and my relationship with her has always been fractured to the end which sucks because now six years later I'm 21 I wish I could've resolved things with her and I miss her dearly. 

And now she's still the central figure in my life even after death. Stupid left over weird ass trauma."

> In short, yes.

> Hakumai, polished rice came into use in the Genroku period at the end of the 17th century and the period at the beginning of the 18th century. It was the staple food prized by the emperors, nobles, warriors and wealthy merchants. Genmai, unpolished brown rice became the food of only the poor.
At this period in time the average person ate ~450g rice per day (a huge amount by modern standards), and those who ate just white rice (including Emperor Meiji) suffered from a lot of malnutrition caused health issues.
