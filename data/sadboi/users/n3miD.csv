When Paige uses the protection spell on that man it creates a major catastrophe in which all manner of death is stopped because of a change in the natural order and that results in piper's death so to speak and almost her own death also.....

AmItheAsshole,fni4th7,t3_g1ol4b,1586973990.0,"Tbh I'm going with ESH and only because it seems like a lack of communication and lack of sleep is causing op to become elevated which is causing hubby to be elevated

 I sympathise with the hubby a little bit only because we don't know his job or what he does....he could be in a field where a lack of sleep could be just as dangerous as op not getting sleep such as truck driving etc so him taking night shifts could be out of the question, he could be in a field where it's equally important for him to decompress because if he doesn't his mental health could be at risk such as working in the mental health or AOD fields....

it's a sucky situation for both of them and they both need to work together to sort out the issue.....op says she can't have her family help out because he doesn't like them....well he doesn't need to see them, why cant op have them help out whilst hubby is at work...op is afraid of his reaction to having her family help so hasn't broached the subject with him but on the other hand he may just not want them around whilst he is around.....op says she won't get his family involved because they don't like her because she kept working after their daughter was born but this is their family we are talking about again it has nothing to do with her, Even if she wasn't working a lack of sleep is not healthy and either way she would need help....she is the breadwinner of the family so maybe if her family and his are no go's for helping out then maybe they need to hire a nanny to help out.....perhaps there is a friend who could help?

there are a multitude of solutions in this situation but op can't just shut her hubby's needs out, they are just as important as her needs and whilst again I don't think op is necessary an arsehole in this situation it seems as though it's gotten to a point where communication is so bad that her actions may come across as selfish even if they aren't due to wrongly worded conversations or sheer frustrations due to lack of sleep and heightened emotions"
