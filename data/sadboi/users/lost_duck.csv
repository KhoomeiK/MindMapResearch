BPD,flgxv2y,t3_fkvejt,1585152398.0,I think posts about dealing with the pandemic situation or maybe a weekly virus thread should be allowed. it's already causing huge changes for many of us and posts in a megatread might not get much views
BPDmemes,f4ckuoe,t3_dk8usa,1571530478.0,Oof
BPD,f23l13w,t3_dblbnb,1569929632.0,"Work on turning your focus towards yourself, *your* feelings, *your* life. Go out, do things you love, meet new people(very helpful! ) , be active in your own life when the object of attraction is not around. I really think the way to do this is building a better sense of self reliance. I know this can be really hard for people with bpd but this is the road I'm taking and its actually working, I've become less insecure in my attachments and I think it's still improving.

For this to work, I can't be around my partner too much. So I have to make decisions to not be around him, even if I feel like I want to. Make plans and don't turn them down for your attachment."
BPD,f0tlm66,t3_d6esmt,1568924433.0,I relate so much. Everyone thinks I'm just too lazy to do anything with my life
BPD,ezxnl2t,t3_d2tsb4,1568244922.0,"Sounds like an anxious attachment style. I think it can especially strong in people with bpd. I'm exactly the same and working really hard on self love because I think that's where the cure lies. I'll post a link to a podcast series that deals with this. Really recommend giving it a try! It's really good and intelligent, and presented in a warm, laid-back tone. I've learned so much from it, feels like having a little coach cheering me on in my quest for freedom :

BPD,eyzbix0,t3_cz1ydk,1567613976.0,"Hey, I have gotten into buddhism and meditation. Unfortunatelu I'm not very consistent with my practice but I think that the philosophy is HUGE for people with BPD and its slowly but surely influencing me in a way that helps my recovery. I also love looking into stoicism, daoism and other philosophies. I find psychedelics to be very useful for exploring perspectives too, but they're not for everyone and should be used very carefully. Not a recommendation, just a mention. 

Anyway, I am *absolutely* certain that spirituality and philosophy can play a huge part in recovery if you feel an inclination towards it."
BPD,eynvn0r,t3_cxjta6,1567263213.0,"Can relate.. I am terrified of taking ownership of my life.. Realising that I'm in charge, responsible for my own happiness and all that stuff. Not sure why its so scary. But that's what causes me to be so passive"
BPD,eynt2lq,t1_ey6cvbz,1567261299.0,"Yeah it's like ""okay, we're here again"""
BPD,eyns7h7,t3_cxspbf,1567260632.0,"Dating is super hard! We must remember to put ourselves first, it's so easy to get attachrd and lose ourselvrs in some new person we don't really know. I really recommend this podcast series on anxious attachment. I've been listening to it a lot lately. It feels like having a little mentor.

BPD,eyns1hq,t3_cxskj5,1567260475.0,"Focus on the feeling, turn towards it and really sense it in my body instead of trying to escape. Yeah it's hard as hell, I'm not always able to do it"
BPD,eynrrpj,t3_cxso4f,1567260152.0,"I feel you, I struggle with this myself. My advicr is, try to focus on how you are feeling, in your body. And don't be upset with yourself for being obsessed, just accept that this is where you are now.

I'm in a weird relationship situation myself now, I'm terribly in love with this guy, it's affecting my body to the point where I can barely eat. I think it might get easier, but I've decided to give it some time and if it doesn't feel better, I will leave the situation for my own health's sake. Just stating this to myself calms me down and reminds me that I put myself first. We can't control other people but we can control how we act and what situations we choose to be in. That is HUGE. Setting boundaries is terrifying to me because I want people to be happy with me, but I know it's gonna be empowering once I follow through. And it gives him less power over me, because it means he isn't my ""everything"". A relation isn't worth it in the long run if it makes us feel like shit, no matter how great the other person is. We only have one life, gotta try to make it nice :) Good luck <3"

BPD,ey3lr1m,t1_exuyqmo,1566767568.0,Been there many times. Sorry you're going through this too <3
BPD,ey3lkvz,t1_exuvtcp,1566767441.0,"I feel you so much, that uncertainty is incredibly hard. I know it's hard (I'm rarely able to do it myself) but I hope you can find ways to make yourself happy in the meantime. you are worthy and you deserve all of the good self love<3"

BPD,ey3j6ib,t1_extey7d,1566765721.0,I'm so sorry <3 how are you dealing with it now?
BPD,ey3j54y,t1_extsdax,1566765695.0,"Yeah, my former breakups have caused me to burn a lot of bridges through my behavior. It was never worth it to react the way I did. All my instincts wants to show them how much I'm suffering.. Desperately wanting to be taken care of. But it never made a difference"
BPD,ey3ivtd,t1_extaz2r,1566765512.0,Good for you for getting through it better than you thought! How are you doing now? Are you doing anything that helps?
BPD,ewbxl6n,t3_cnd8p8,1565273865.0,"Yeah it's always temporary, but I think it's worth striving for a life where it shows up more often. I'd love to be happy 40% of the time instead of 10%"
BPD,ewbvy8c,t3_cnfqnd,1565273160.0,"Hey I don't really have any advice to offer, just want to say that I can relate! When my bf needs alone time he turns kind of cold, and I detach to avoid painful feelings. I close my heart. And then the next day when he comes back and is all love and kisses, I open my heart again and reattach so I can reciprocate. It's like a roller-coaster, it's exhausting and it's gonna make me tired of the relationship if I can't find a middle ground.

As I said, I haven't found it yet, but I *think* the solution for me is to work on cultivating that bigger, selfless unconditional love. The kind of love that is always accepting and doesn't have expectations. Metta meditation might be good- it helps me with many bpd symptoms. 
I have also told my bf that I feels nice when he tells me he loves me when he leaves, it helps me feel less abandoned. Let me know if you find a solution that works for you :)"
BPD,eowh7t2,t3_btatq1,1558909771.0,Thank you for this. I saved the article and I'm going to read it over and over again.
