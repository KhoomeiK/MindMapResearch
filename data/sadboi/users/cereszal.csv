I'm sorry to say this but your entire family, including yourself are enablers. There's nothing anyone can say or do to stop or change things. They will take her side ultimately, be it by manipulation or voluntary, even your brother.
If you realise this, you might have an easier time removing yourself from guilt. Whatever type of guilt you're facing. One's that she taught you and survivors guilt. If you still hold on to some guilt or obligations, you will eventually become like her. It's what she wants. Happened to me.
Anyway, if you're able to overcome this and be ""selfish"", you will eventually escape. You are lucky you have a potential place to stay.
Take this opportunity, leave and never look back.
That being said, money is the biggest hurdle. You'd have to secretly save and find a cheap place to rent.
Your entire family will eventually disown you and choose her side. You will find new ones, ones that won't hurt you. But you will be vulnerable and it would be better not to develop any strong relationships at this point due to your past ptsd in abuse.

singapore,fl2w7um,t1_fl2rn9v,1584761541.0,">If somehow, lets say you have no known prior community spreads, and you possibly sat next to an infected person. 

That's the contradiction I pointed out in my OP. If I sat next to an infected person, it is unlikely that they have the app and that they are aware that they are infected in the first place.

If they had the app, they are unlikely to leave their quarantined premises. Why?

Putting the idea of ""I will be caught leaving my house if I use this app"" aside, we need to keep in mind that this person downloaded this app with the reason to reduce the spread of the virus. Hence my assumption.

It doesn't make sense that someone would download this app *and* leave their quarantine zone. Otherwise, my question of ""Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine? "" is still valid.

If ""time"" is your point here, there is a 14 day incubation period [or more](https://www.businessinsider.sg/wuhan-coronavirus-symptoms-24-days-after-infection-2020-2?op=1&r=US&IR=T) for someone to be infected without major symptoms. This doesn't help with time.

Other than that, it does make sense that this app is to reduce the time to locate those who were contacted by the infected.

Your point of making it easy for contacts to be found as well as my idea of notifying contacted people to visit the doctor could definitely be made clear on the website to increase the probability of downloads."
singapore,fl2v1fy,t1_fl2rxm7,1584760646.0,That doesn't clarify my point about how there are people who might be infected and not know about it.

singapore,fl2r315,t1_fl2pv34,1584757763.0,"Just to clarify, I'm not implying that this app has the intention to capture those who are breaking the law.

If I understand correctly, there are already other implementations to catch such persons - such as sending SMS, reporting GPS locations, etc.

Considering that this app's intention is to not trace those who leave their quarantine areas, I still don't understand how it could help?Especially if we keep in mind about these important groups of people who might/might not use this app:

* Those unaware they were infected or in contact with those infected
* Supposed quarantined persons of those in contact with an infected person
* Quarantined infected person

The only thing I can think of is that if there is an infected person, all their contact plus and users might get a message like this: ""Have you been in contact with this person x? If so, please go to the doctor immediately.""

This was not clear in the video/website so I am probably assuming a lot of things here. But if I'm right, it does make sense and this should be a clear point for the app.   
Otherwise, there would be others who won't see the use of this app as I've pointed out and you might understand the reason behind my point."
singapore,fl2oznu,t3_fm41s6,1584756286.0,"If someone has COVID, they and those who were in contact with them will be quarantined. It's either that or they/contact won't be aware that they have it.

This app would work if the infected person went out of their quarantined premises and have the app installed. I'm sure such a person would get into trouble for leaving their quarantined premises in the first place. I could be wrong but what I understand about quarantine is that there will be checks to ensure that the person has remained within their premises.

Had there been many cases where someone was caught breaking quarantine?

It's either that, or I'm not understanding something - which isn't addressed in the OP.

I went for the wysa 3 months subscription. Iirc, it had a better offer. I'm not sure of other apps which has real time talking but the therapist will respond in 24 hours apart from the sessions that you've booked.
All the best :3"
singapore,fctu9bg,t1_fctipf6,1577959834.0,"Ya and in wysa, you can vent a lot :p  
I didn't like woebot either, it always assumes you're in a crisis or something but I can report successes to the therapist and they would be glad to hear it either way.

My personal exp for relationships is to focus on myself instead of the other. One of the most difficult thing to do is to accept them for who they are w/o trying to change or control them. That's true ""love"" in a way where it will lead me to understand if I can be with them or not.

Not trying to give advice but share my exp abit."
singapore,fct1hbj,t1_fcssijy,1577930426.0,"Not bad. I mostly was able to overcome a lot of things myself :p

The app itself is free and there's a chatbot but you can subscribe for the therapist which is not so pricy. I forgot the rates but it's a subscription. I took the longest one, 3 months because I'm in a very alamak state.

I do my own thing as well such as meditation, yoga, etc. Learning Buddhism philosophy, or other types as well. It mostly helps and there's a lot of free info on youtube. Any1 here can feel free to PM me if interested to share-share abit :3"
singapore,fcpalz2,t3_eib7pd,1577856292.0,I'm using Wysa (not advertising ar) app. You can vent to them anytime and be completely anon. I don't have any recommendations for face-to-face types apart from fsc (no exp there as well)

CPTSD,fcbmkza,t3_egr7er,1577588593.0,"I did, but I already know as much as I need to know.
I need to know about myself first and foremost. So I try to switch my thoughts from trauma to self love.
It's. Not. Easy.
I have to spend a few mins every morning meditating to love myself. I imagine how I would be loved, pampered, etc and imagine it's me. It took some time but I stopped seeking it in others.
I've also learnt about my own psychology and further education and studies such as science, programming, etc. I try to shift my perspective and thinking into something more productive than take some time off to myself in a park or something to contemplate so that I'm not running away from my feelings, etc.
It's a daily fight but I try to think of it like I'm playing a game and levelling myself up with self love, etc.

That's what they want you to do. To give your everything to them, but it will never be enough.
So might as well choose you."

unpopularopinion,fbszsp8,t1_fbqtv4v,1577064539.0,"Ties weren't around for decades?
Women complain about being forced to wear skirts or lipsticks in certain jobs.
Of course it's best to avoid such jobs but it's not always possible. So it depends on the job nature. 
If its written in the job description that a man would be fired for not wearing a tie, the best thing to do is to level up and get a better job. Otherwise, they could sue the job for firing them for such arbitrary reasons.
There are new jobs being created all the time. You either complain and victimise yourself or find something better to work in while dealing with your current situation."
