SuicideWatch,fo3ierj,t3_g5ejp3,1587487421.0,"I have a form of autism which basically renders me useless in the response and advice giving front. Despite this, I am more than happy to listen to people talk about how they're feeling and what problems they're having. If someone is willing to listen to you but doesn't know what to say afterwards, it's not that they don't care, they're more than likely to geniunely not know how to respond or what you want to hear. The ""you should see a therapist line"" is something they'll say to make the fact that they don't know how to respond less awkward. Although, this same line would be used by people who weren't actually listening and don't care, it really just depends on who you're talking to (close friend vs work colleague)  


This is my experience on the matter, but as I stated, I do have autism which will affect how I perceive these kinds of things."
