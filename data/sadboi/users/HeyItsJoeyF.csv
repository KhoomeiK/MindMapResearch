So that day we were doing some kind of writing assignment and I dropped my (barely sharpened) pencil and it landed in the person next to me‚Äôs foot. She yelled ‚ÄúOW‚Äù and caught my teachers attention. Obviously. The teacher walked over and the kid said

‚ÄúHe threw his pencil at my foot!‚Äù The teacher looked at me, then back at her, then told me to go to the office. And I was given a referral. No matter HOW MUCH I tried to explain it was an accident."
