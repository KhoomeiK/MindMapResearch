It's been so scary here the past few months, fires are near by me atm and I may have to evac tomorrow and now everything else that has unfolded worldwide it feels like theres no end. The love and genoristy Aus has finally been receiving is overwhelming, people power is strong. We need to bind together and we will over come anything"
Anxiety,fdjpstr,t1_fdjo2yi,1578482663.0,"Aussie here! I'm with you, never felt so stressed/scared in my life, have fires near by where I am, have had my car packed for a week now and tomorrow/Friday is not looking good for us.  Prepparing your house as best you can and having a plan in place, alleviates some anxiety and take some time out, stay of social media, employ some self care helps too. Be safe out there"
