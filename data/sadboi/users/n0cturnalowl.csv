humanresources,fmqhnrd,t3_fwmwxf,1586299801.0,"I have a similar responsibility where I pay out and keep track of statutory pays for agency staff, and I always remind them or their assigned branch when they are running out of sick days. It just means that we can check in on them, especially as sick days can last a fair few weeks to months at a time. They could be at a place where they are ready to get back into work, so at least you have some notice to get preparations in order to get them back into work. If not- it reminds them that they should get another form of fit note documentation should they need it. 

I've never had a complaint about telling employees about their sick days. If anything I tend to get nice messages back from the staff member and it's helped build rapport. That's my personal experience though."
AskHR,flumnm6,t1_fltcf0r,1585505685.0,"This is a question that I believe once this has finished, I will need to seriously speak to my team about. Hard copies have just always been the way it's been run."
AskHR,flqyd91,t1_flqxf5x,1585409036.0,"Thank you for your insight.

In regards to the hard copies that we print out in the office, all we do with them is write down reference numbers, and mark them off on our recruitment software and then we scan them back into our folders where we upload them to our timesheet processing software. We input the actual hours onto the software too - so the timesheets are just attachments to email to our clients. 

We have access to the servers at home, and asides from printing out the timesheets, we can and have been able to do everything else from home. We keep all the timesheets on our server for any future use, and the hard copies we are keeping in a cupboard in our office until our policy says to destroy them. We currently don't have the software where we can add the reference numbers on the files either. There appears to be a reason for everything, which is almost defeating when I'm seeing the amount of people being infected a day and those who are passing away.

I have been ringing home to my family (who are concerned about me going in), that there is this grey area that because it's healthcare, it's essential. I want to work- but I want to work in the safest possible way to ensure me and my households safety."
COVID19_support,flqpmiz,t1_flqpfvb,1585402857.0,"That would be the best outcome - I have asked the company already if they can give me, or let me borrow a printer, however so far this has seemed to be out the question. Would you say that I need to fight this in that case? My company are pretty good at making employee feel bad for getting against them from personal experience."
COVID19_support,flqon5f,t1_flqo9tv,1585402037.0,"Unfortunately this isn't the reasoning, we are allowed to work from home when we aren't using the printer, but this is only half of the time - we have been allowed to have the work server on our personal computer (I know... GDPR breach!) during these circumstances.

I would say with 100% certainty that it's because they won't get me the equipment I need (printer, cartridges, paper) - all which we have plenty of in the office (or company credit/cash for me to order one).  

My worry is that if this situation gets worse, and if the UK continues to follow the trend of Italy, I won't be able to work at all, or worse- the company would still force me to come into the office."
COVID19_support,flqnu0a,t1_flqn1fz,1585401331.0,"Understandably a lot of company aren't certain of what they should or shouldn't do.

With regards to the risk vs. reward here, we aren't getting any additional compensation for coming into the office. In theory, it might not even have to be a cost to the company, as we have 2 printers already, so I could just bring a printer, cartridge and paper with me, that or ask the management of the building whether I could borrow another businesses printer (although there are a few people still in the building, there are a lot who are primarily working from home). Unfortunately, it is a business where the push-back so far has been intense as it is to allow us to work a couple of days from home. In theory I could just buy a printer- but where the business is distributing bonuses, I don't understand why a printer is more important than my health.

There are a few of us working in the office, and it's certainly not a place where we can do the ""2m apart"" policy which the government has outlined."
