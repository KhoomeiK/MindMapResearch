BPD,f6bj9mg,t1_f6afcsm,1572774435.0,"I know this feeling. I feel so much more comfortable thinking I'm a failure and I might just kill myself if anything goes wrong. But I've learned that it's just because I am uncomfortable with the kind of responsibilty that comes with the opposite.

I was always afraid of being liked because that means that people start to rely on me and I felt responsible for keeping them entertained (at social events) or being there for them (when I feel down and can't). But the more you get used to being better, the more you get used to the idea that your life is supposed to go on, the more you notice that that isn't what anyone expects from you. These people like you for who you are. You don't need to ""work"" all the time. The pressure is all in your head.

It's the same with the ""I never expected to have a future"" idea. You don't need to do everything perfectly. Hell, you don't even need to do anything close to average. You just have to survive. That's your own personal success. And that's more than you would've ever expected from yourself. So see that as a success. You got extra lifetime to spend. Use that any way you like. But don't waste it on thinking about how you never expected to be here. 

This is a bonus round for you. Don't let it be tainted by the life you've expirienced before. Make it something new, something exciting and special."
BPD,f6bgyyt,t3_dqth6i,1572773596.0,"I feel you. I think sometimes we retroactively construct memories of our childhood to be, in contrast to other's childhoods, worse than they really were.

When talking to my therapist, I always mentioned how bad my childhood was . But when he asks about specifics I remember as many positive moments as I do negative. It's just not present in my mind.

And yes, I get so, so mad when people don't understand my struggle and talk about how good their childhood was and how much they miss it. Only when I really get to reflect I notice that my childhood was just as fine as theirs was. 

Even though it wasn't all good in my case and I've recognized that the stem of my problem definitely lies in my childhood, I've talked to friends who seem happy all the time and who I've hated before for their seemingly ""easy"" childhood and they told me stories that were very similar to my experiernces.

What those experiences do to you is very individual. You can't quantify pain, and you can't say that one kind of childhood expirience will lead to a specific outcome. People can grow up happy and end up with severe sadness and vice-versa. Do not compare yourself to other in that regard. What matters is how you feel right now and how you are going to cope with that."
BPD,f6bf3uf,t3_dqigzr,1572772932.0,"I understand completely. I always have this urge to be the most important person in my FP's life. But you have to recognize that your FP is just that: your FP.
While you might feel they are the most important person in the world to you, most often they are not. Most important to you are the people that stick by your side, that help you cope with your illness. On the other hand - and this is the hardest of facts - you are probably not the most important person to your FP. No matter how much you long for it. You might feel that you are the person that can take care of them the best, and I always feel like this and I'm convinced I could help them more than anyone else, but what helps me is to think about how I don't always want the most helpful advice and I don't always want the person that is the most reliable to be there to be there for me. That's just how people work.

We know we are the ones that would give up everything for them. But that's not what matters in these situations. It is a romantic fantasy of what people want and need in times of stress.


You are not responsible for your FP's well-being. You are responsible for YOUR well-being. You need to take care of that before anything else. Nobody can rely on you if you can't rely on yourself."
BPD,f6bcay6,t3_dktvds,1572771782.0,"I'm a little late, but: my answer, aside from everything else said here, is: friends. Not even my closest friends, but people outside of my circle that don't know much about my SO that can provide some form of neutral insight and ground me. It's always helped me tremedously to have a couple of friends outside of my inner circle I can reach out to to get some perspective on things. 
Best case scenario this is someone who has expirience with some form of mental illness, maybe someone you know from therapy or you noticed has similar problems and you exchanged numbers."
