BipolarReddit,f2cmn7j,t3_dcwrme,1570139961.0," I understandthe feeling you should go to the hospital but can't, money, responsibilities, whatever. And I wont say that when I have been hospitalized helped much. I'm still here so theres that I guess. 

Draw on yourself if that helps you, it has to be better than actually hurting yourself. Maybe try to make it a positive experience and write anything good you can think of. Even if its only one thing. Try to hold on, ride the wave, this part of your life will pass eventually."
BipolarReddit,evw331l,t3_cli7sw,1564853898.0,"I was on it for a few months. Almost up to the highest ""safe"" dose. I have BP and PTSD. Sadly it didnt help me at all. I kept waiting hoping it would work.

Give it a some time. Maybe keep a mood tracker to help and see if it's working for you."

It sad how easy it is to abuse employees because they know you need a job."
