louisck,fmk2sx3,t3_fuzebc,1586143178.0,"I thought it was spot on. It was exactly what I expected. I don't think anyone can justify the brutal nature of how Louis was punished by the entirety of outrage culture. The man is a pillar in the comedic art. To edge him out of the respect he deserves over what he did, in my opinion, is so ridiculous.

He addressed the issues. He said his piece and then he carried on. To still be ruminating on this man's kink is so foolish.

I've never shelled out 8 dollars quicker than when I heard this special was out. My generation grew up in Louis and I always wanted to have some closure on the subject. This felt like closure. The special was aptly named."

AskReddit,flvnp03,t3_fre3wa,1585527890.0,"I agree so much about just wanting someone around. I recently had a great time with a girl and we git to hang out and spent the night and we slept together. The sex was really great but we held each other all night and it just felt so good. I miss it so much. 

She seems a little aloof and it sucks. I am crushing so much and it doesn't look like she feels the same. You always wonder when you're lonely; ""who could be the one I meet to change all this?"" When you meet someone who exceeds all expectations and it doesn't work out, it feels raw. Not because of them. She has her own stuff going on. Her mother just passed away and her family is in crisis or something similar to a crisis. So, maybe being worried about this is a little selfish.

I have my son. I have time. I just wish I had someone with me to enjoy it all."
