Ijustwatched,flrqu05,t3_fqplvk,1585425903.0,I too love this movie.But I have seen that not many give this film much appreciation.I wonder why though coze the film does have the same quality and musicals and does show all aspects of the culture on which storyline or folklore was based on like Aladdin and Hercules.

depression,fljdp55,t3_fow078,1585208159.0,"Its hard to go on for me too coze that stupid voice inside my head keeps on saying that I'm useless and that being alive won't make a difference in such a cruel world.When I try to move on with all the courage I have,I'm once again disheartened by those surrounding me who think I'm perfectly fine and its just my laziness that is to be blamed for the boredom I'm having.
I don't know how it would be like if it weren't for memes and the chatrooms like this.
I feel what you are going through as I have gone through and I'm going through these situations everyday.
Feel free to chat whenever you want to.Or can I have permission to make the first step?
Of course I'm a guy but please don't think that I'm taking advantage.I too want someone from the opposite gender who knows how bad this mental illness is to talk to.I think only thing that every other guy here need is someone particularly a girl who can understand their feelings in a place where men are supposed to be strong and capable.
It doesn't mean that we aren't strong either tho.I wouldn't have been here if I weren't.
I think you and me would make good friends."

depression,fl0yah5,t3_fltp8a,1584718304.0,"Nope..I too had such thoughts when I was at my lowest.
I later figured out,its coze both u and me know that our mums love us too much that we know they will forgive us no matter what.So this cowardly disease which ruins both of our lives,makes us think this ways making us believe that they are too incapable to react.
In reality,u and me are much loved and wanted by everyone else.
There is time for both of us to make things like what they used to be or like what we would want them to be remembered as.
You are a courageous and beautiful soul.
Like several others have helped me in past days,I would like to be a help for you too.Feel free to chat with me whenever you want to"
depression,fkzophn,t3_fldr2o,1584676141.0,"Same thing here too.I can't get any help from my parents coze they treat me like the 'weakest in the lot' and they consider it a shame to ask for expert guidance when it comes to mental healthness.I don't understand what is going through their heads when I need help.THESE PEOPLE grew up in a family of eight siblings so they don't know what loneliness or being isolated by others feels like.
I belong to a lower caste in a place/country where caste and religion is very important.I used to be ignored and discriminated in school.I was an A grade student but teachers never encouraged me.So I was on myself from a very young age now that I don't have any friends.And on the top of that my 'family' treats me like I doesn't exist.
I used to have dreams but now I only wish to die so that I can bring an end to this suffering.I tried several things to keep going on like I tried a foreign language but now I'm at a point asking myself why should I keep fighting when there is seemingly no one to truly understand the person that I am.
I just want someone's hands to caress my hair.I wanna feel loved.
Hope things turn up good for you mate.We have a long life to get things straight right?"

depression,fc60agk,t3_eg9dzt,1577469461.0,"Its relatable to many here including me.I too don't have a easily likable personality or at least that's what I think.So I don't think I can get a person to understand who I am or what I went through and then to show affection.
But I still like to believe that there is someone for everyone,whatever they may be.I hope that I will accidentally stumble on that special girl,who in turn was wishing the same thing,someday.
I wish that the same will happen to you too and make both your lives far better like what you wish right now.
Yeah,it sure will happen for both you and me one day.The world is not too small to stop that from becoming a reality."
