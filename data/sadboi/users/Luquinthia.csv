1) talk to yourself like you would talk to a good friend. It take time and practice. When you catch yourself being mean to yourself - tell yourself to stop. Right there and then tell yourself ""don't say that about my friend"". It helps. 

2) yes

3) don't worry too much about the meaning behind attractions right now. If you like someone, cool. Your identity will shake itself out. You don't have to align yourself to a label over one crush.

4) learning to love yourself and be confident in yourself will bring good people into your life."

My new job is in the early early stages of a startup and the risk is HELLA high, but I have the opportunity to move into roles that suit me better. And since I am in early stages of startup, I'm getting a lot of say in processes that will help make my current position easier/more efficient. I really prefer it. I'm earning less right now, but it shouldn't be that way long. And I was more willing to take on a challenge that's risky than get stuck in a miserable place that I could earn okay money at.

As I got older, I quickly passed my mother in emotional maturity. I had to be the adult because she wouldn't be. 

My parents cannot be trusted. They are manipulative liars who just tell you what you want to hear so you'll hold up your end of the bargain. Then when it's their turn they are appalled at your audacity.
