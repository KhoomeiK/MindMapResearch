Explanation: Her neck seems a bit tight against the bottom of her jaw, like an athlete or as if she's scared, but the rest  of the face doesnt reflect that, is plump and relaxed. The neck seems overly long since it's jutting from what seems like a very small body. The size of the body would be fine from an overhead perspective plane, but curently, her right shoulder is almost non-existant. So it feels like her head is bigger than her torso.

Another thing that makes her look a bit alien to me  are the purple tentacles taking the place of  her receding hair, but that's cool."

Dependency varies with the medication of course, so if that's really what your mother is worried about you could maybe ask your doctor about it.

There's many different kind of medication and they changed a lot in the past century. You mum is worried because of what she heard during her lifetime and it's completly normal to worry for you. Yes, some medication can create a dependance, but the benefits they bring could help break the anxiety and or depression cycle you're stuck into.

Tips to get yourself to focus: -*Stay calm, take it slowly*\-

It can be (really) unerving, but if you let yourself take the time you need, you will advance. Even if slowly, even if not as fast as you're used to, or as fast as you think you need to, you will advance if you go slowly. Give yourself the time, try to relax, do not think about the things you cannot do, do baby steps. 

\-*Be kind to yourself*\-

Try to go throught with it without ""forcing"" yourself to do it. Instead, convince yourself that you're ok, that you're safe, that you got time to do it and that it's ok if you can't solve something the first time you look at it. Instead, just go to another problem, and perhaps later you can come back to the ones you could not do at first. 

Tips to get yourself to sit down and start:

Take small steps, reward yourself with some things you enjoy, do not think about what you could not do, think about what you did. Just sitting at your desk is already a huge victory. Now continue, calmly, take your things out. OK! now what do you have to do? Don't think about the mountain, do one thing at a time, stay calm. Try to look at the first thing. If it's too scary, look at the second or third thing, then search for a solution calmly, breathe deeply if it's too stressfull.

If it doesnt work the first time, try not to give yourself a hard time for it, try to focus on the positives of your actions, on the improvements you make. Even if nothing worked, reward yourself for trying, you can be pround of that and you should. This is not easy, but each small step is a victory that you can be really pround of considering your depression and all the pressure you're going throught."

May I ask what's the job? maybe some people could give you some tips about it.

If your boss is smart, they'll know it's your first job and they wont expect too much out of you.

Any new job is very stressfull. Just try to go there first (on time, or even 15 min early), report to your boss or supervisor when you arrive. Listen to what other coworker have to say and see what they have in plan for you for the next few days. Explore the environement, what you will work with, greet the other people you meet around you and try to be charming ... so just be the usual you.

Normally there wont be too much for you to do in the begining. That's normal, it well help you relax a bit and aclimate yourself first. They might give you small tasks or asign you a mentor to ask questions to.

For people pleasing, keep in mind that relations takes time to build, so of course you will not be able to share the jokes and all the conversations on the first day, but maybe some people will try to reach out to you too and include you in the conversations, giving you explanations of how things work, etc.

Asking questions to someone more knowledgable can be flattering to them if you listen to what they say. If they are too busy they will let you know. Try to reach out to them, ask if you can eat with them during dinner to better bond with them. if not, that's ok, get out a book and relax on your well deserved break.

I think you can do it and I think that if they chose you, then you'll do great."

For my part, I suggest Spaghettis and ratatouilles (and soups... oo and also moroccan couscous) since they require a varied mix of  many differents  vegetables, so you can vary them depening on what's avaliable, your taste and the price of ingredients You usually make a lot at the same time and keep the rest for later (in the freezer).  It's easy to cook, you just boil everything in a big container while stirring everything now and then so that it doesnt stick to the bottom.

Plus, it's good. The real difficulty is cutting all those vegetables and cleaning afterward.

The recipe I used for spaghetti was: 1/2 Celery, 1-2 onions, 1 eggplant, 1-2 zuchinni, 1 fresh italian parsley, 2 bell pepper, 6-8 garlic cloves, 2 cans of tomato-sauce (or tomato paste), a few sausages ( about  6 small spicy ones I think), some ground meat ( 500g? maybe one kilo I'm not sure sorry).
