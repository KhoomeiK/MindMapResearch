위 is already a diphthong (consisting of ㅜ andㅣ) and therefore you cannot put another vowel in there so when adding ㅓit is placed in the next syllable block creating  쉬어.

Correct me if I'm wrong."

When my tinnitus gets worse I go into full panic and have the same thoughts as you, worrying that I'll never be able to sleep again and eventually die from it. And it comes out of nowhere. Like, I'll think ""tomorrow I'm going to start doing X"" and my body will be like ""nope, let's worsen you tinnitus (or some other thing I'm suffering from) so that you can't do anything""."

swedish,f07tfuu,t3_d446h1,1568468510.0,"""Ju"" is a very common adverb that can be used seperately, but when it is used seperately it's hard to translate it to English. It emphasizes what you're saying, and is used for when you think the other person should already know this. 

Examples:   
Men jag ***har ju*** gjort det   
But I ***DID*** do it

Jag sa ***ju*** det   
I ***already*** said that

***Där*** är du ***ju***!   
Oh, ***THERE*** you are!

Du är ***ju*** jättebra på att sjunga!   
You're a really good singer! (***I didn't know that/What do you mean you can't sing – I disagree***)

Det var ***ju*** inte så svårt   
It wasn't that hard (***surprisingly***)

""Desto"" (less common than ""ju"") can be used like this:

***Desto*** mer för mig då   
***(All) the*** more for me then

Utan X blir det ***desto*** svårare att Y.   
Without X it's ***all the more*** difficult to Y."
swedish,f04ybw6,t1_f04t7gw,1568398456.0,"You can't just say ""Jag tänker om dig"", it's not a complete sentence.

If you want to say ""Do you want to know what *I think about you*"" then you would say ""Vill du veta vad *jag tänker om dig*"".

But you wouldn't say *Jag tänker om dig* if you just want to tell someone that you're thinking of them."
swedish,f04xqay,t3_d3sbs0,1568398050.0,"Jag **tänker** på dig = I'm thinking about you

***Tycker om*** means that you like something, for example: *Jag* ***tycker om*** *dig = I* ***like*** *you*

***Tycker*** however, translates to think, as in *Vad* ***tycker*** *du om det här? = What do you* ***think*** *about this?*

*What do you* ***think*** *about this?* can also be said as *""Vad* ***tänker*** *du om det här?""* and in this sentence tycker/tänker could be interchangeble, but there's a slight difference even though they both translate to ""think"". Tycker in this type of sentence is more like ""Do you think this sounds good/bad""""and tänker is more like ""What are your thoughts about this"".

However, *Jag tycker om dig* ONLY means that I like you, not that I'm thinking about you.

Am I confusing you?"

I agree that 잘 못하다 makes more sense, so I'll use that, and 잘 못 하다 is probably all wrong, like you said. I do see it a lot though, but I guess, like the user *caomei1408* said, Koreans don't pay that much attention to spacing, especially when writing on the internet.

If I wanted to say ""I can't speak Korean"", that has to do with my ability and not something preventing me. So I wouldn't use 못 is my initial thought. 

But according to TTMIK ""A more common way (than  ㄹ 수 없다 ) to say “cannot” in spoken Korean is by adding 못 before a verb. """
Korean,ewm6dwi,t1_ewm57uz,1565544249.0,"That's the lesson I just finished, and I think it's very well written and as I did the lesson I felt like I understood it, but then I looked at TTMIK's lesson on the same topic, and that's when I got confused. If what he writes on HTSK is all correct, then I guess I understand most of it.

But for example, he writes that  못 can mean 2 things, either I didn't do something well OR I couldn't because something prevented me - is this true or does it only mean I can't?

And also, I just want to make sure that I use the right spacing, cause I've seen all the different versions that I included in my post, and I would like to know which ones are correct and which ones are just wrong to use."
swedish,ewfjit0,t3_co1qkb,1565362256.0,"**I'm** ***at home*** **= Jag är** ***hemma***

""I hus"" *can* be used, but only in certain (other) situations, and is **not** used for saying that you're at home.   
An example of ""i hus"" would be:  
\- ""Jag bodde i hus förut"" (I lived in houses\* before), or   
\- ""Jag skulle vilja bo i hus"" (I would like to live in a house\*).   
*\* I don't really know how to translate it, it doesn't specify if it's singular or plural.*

You would most likely never use ""Jag är i hus"", it would roughly translate to ""I'm in houses"" and how often do you say that? :)
