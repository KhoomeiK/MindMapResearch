DecidingToBeBetter,fe6aa0b,t3_enur0a,1578885316.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. I get it. When we point the fingers at ourselves, transformation can begin.  I’ve listened to more than a few audio books, and “The way of the superior man” by David Deida was huge in reshaping myself, and my marriage. It changed it from almost divorced to more than amazing. I hope it helps.  Small steps! 1% better everyday. Best of luck to you!"

DeadBedrooms,ewxc8fr,t1_ewwol4h,1565852189.0,That sucks. Im sorry. Make yourself better for the future you deserve.  I hope you get a lot from it.  You can rewrite your destiny as soon as you choose to.
DeadBedrooms,ewvtee8,t1_ewv98rg,1565813550.0,"This. The book. Trust the process. You want her to change? Change yourself first.  It’s a must. I was in your exact place. I finally pointed the finger at myself, made some changes, and our relationship is insane now.  I can’t keep her off of me... You know what happens when she’s moved the goalposts? You change your aim. She will always move it to test you...Read or listen to the book. I hope all the best for you."

sweatystartup,euqt459,t3_ch8bbz,1563984882.0,"Holy cow I couldn’t say this any better. I’ve run a business for 10 years.  I was completely addicted to it. I had a mental breakdown when a large project fell through, and It cost me my house, and almost my marriage. I’m closing it up end of the year. It was painful losing my “identity”, but it was also the best thing that ever happened. I really enjoyed having the business, but I was completely ignoring my wife and daughter, escaping to my business. I see things differently now, and I’m a better man for it. Thank you for writing this. I do wish the best for anyone starting a business, but don’t lose sight of the most important things."
TonyRobbins,et7sr0k,t1_et6zls1,1562537253.0,"We destroyed old beliefs, and slowly got rid of a lot of the things that were dividing us. Sold our home, and I’m dissolving my business. Simplified everything. We might have those things again someday, but it’s not a priority like I used to make it. I also had to let go of what society told me I should be doing.  ( working more, playing less ) i work a lot less now, which gives me more time to be present with my wife. We can’t afford much, but I don’t feel the need to buy things to be happy. That was my old habit."
TonyRobbins,erj738a,t1_erizhkg,1560917766.0,"I battled a lot with negative emotions and have found meditation to be the most helpful. I continue Daly 15 mins minimum. It’s amazing what 10 minutes a day, of guided meditation can do. I hope it helps!"
TonyRobbins,erizdn3,t3_c29lr1,1560911333.0,"UPW, DWD, daily meditation, and lots of books on audible. It’s been a year and half of transformation, and it’s sustainable. It’s like going to the gym for your brain. The more you do it, the stronger it gets. My wife and I started our 15 years of marriage over, from scratch, and it’s insane. So much better, and I’ve destroyed beliefs that were solid. Keep searching, you’ll find it."

TonyRobbins,eov3zdq,t3_bt95ds,1558888074.0,Unleash the Power Within. It’s the first event we did. Usually 3 days of immersion. He does a few a year all over. Just doing that one event and nothing else will have a big impact. You get breakthroughs and insights that could be really helpful in life.
TonyRobbins,eouzfzf,t3_bt95ds,1558884996.0,It really opened up a lot of things I didn’t know. It changed my life for sure. Try a UPW for starters or even watch his YouTube stuff. Best of luck to you.
