Literally all he said. Then, he fired him. Said he wasn’t “respecting his authority.” Hate him anyway, he took 4 of my hours the other day bc he gets to work 12-close now for some reason and he’s so damn slow at putting the damn veggies on.

His mom literally pays for everything for him.. he’s the baby of the family, and she has a lot of ptsd issues, so I guess it’s hard for her to let go. Not saying it’s right, just saying I know where she’s coming from. Right now I’m only making anywhere from $132-170 at Jimmy Johns... so I’m sure I’d get a decent amount.

Ppl keep telling me to get my ex for child support, but it wouldn’t do anything but hurt her grandma, and she’s practically been playing the dad role since she was born. And I really don’t want courts to be involved again, they were back in 2016 because of him, and I just want him and everything behind me, plus he’s gonna have another baby in may, so I’m sure he’ll have enough to keep him busy/enough to worry about.
