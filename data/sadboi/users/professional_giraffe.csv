Overstimulation is a major symptom of PTSD, which I have as well, so I think it's more related to that but to me it all feels the same. There are times when I've dealt with the world to my best ability but just can't take all the noise and white noise and silence and hallucinations thrown in, I'm uncomfortable most of the time. But it's also a symptom of autism, which we are finding out is related to SZ somehow (if one runs in the family the other often does too)."
