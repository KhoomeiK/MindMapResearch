grammar,fcrlarl,t3_eijpk0,1577903292.0,"This comic demonstrates a problem with general expectations between the two words: https://xkcd.com/326/

Almost always, ""affect"" is a verb and ""effect"" is a noun. ""I feel the effects"" vs ""I am affected"".

But ""effect"" can also be a verb, which I understand is to generate an effect (noun). ""I intend to effect change in the world."""

formcheck,faqgn0w,t3_eafux0,1576302776.0,"A  paraphrased quote from Juggernaut ""always treat 135 like your max, and your max like 135"".

I'm novice to weightlifting, but what stands out to me is the unpredictable flexion in your lower back, your hand position, your glance over the shoulder and your uncontrolled drop.

You clearly have some good strength to lift that heavy, but I think it would serve you well to dial it back and practice lighter more. Lift a lighter load and treat it like a real danger, so that when you lift a dangerous load you can treat it like it's easy.

Breathe deep into your core to keep your back straight and tight, and don't let it loose. Love and care for your precious vertebrae."
