If I were to have died in a car accident and people went through my DM's, people would have contacted her assuming she was my girlfriend.

I accidentally catch her cheating and suddenly she does a 180 and says we were never in a relationship, I'm just a friend, and messaging her for a basic explanation as to what the fuck happened is ""stalking"" her.

Okay, so the police roll up on us one evening while we're arguing about this in front of some bar and she has every opportunity to scream that I'm some creepy dude following her around town, she instead nods and stares at the ground when the officer asks if we're having ""the talk."""

Basically Covid started, and the first day, from the first patient, he ended up catching it.

Said he was sweating like crazy and felt really cold. I'd have to ask for specifics but he went hard on the chicken soup, Vitamin C, and gatorade, and slept a lot. After a week or so he felt better enough to play Warzone with us and essentially had a 1 month paid vacation from work in which we stayed up every night until 4am playing video games. He fully recovered and is back at work now, Covid free. 

He says the workload has definitely slowed down as he's mentioned that people are now so spooked by hospitals and catching covid that they're only treating *actual emergencies*, which is how it should be. 

I have stopped watching the news entirely and if I have questions, I just go to him which has made the lockdown bearable as I'm not forced to sift through fake news propaganda.

I have zero complaints about how she dresses but that's a personal taste thing, really. Society seems to be split 50/50 on whether emo girls are absurdly hot or astronomical levels of cringe, and I'm in the former category and for that I apologize.

Bigger question that should be asked are in regards to some of her outfits. For all intents and purposes she's a children's show host on YouTube and yet she's dressed like a dominatrix some days.

I 100% believe it's been in NHL for years as well. 

Back in the early 2010's my friend and I used to do online couch co-op with the Texas Stars AHL team. It started as a joke until we found ourselves winning consistently against international or NHL teams and the games always played out the same way. The first period we had to play absurdly good defense and ensure only one goal was scored on us, and from then on out it felt like our players got a massive stats boost for the rest of the game. We'd go on 4-5 game win streaks a night and undress 90-95 overall goalies with AHL bums. 

It was funny as hell but it also begged the question why we were able to consistently do this for an entire decade's worth of games."

BPDlovedones,fqekz04,t3_gi32w5,1589309288.0,"I guess that it's only fair I elaborate.

She'd told our friends we were in a relationship prior to us ever having the *""what are we?""* discussion. I was being congratulated by my friends for dating a girl I didn't actually know I was dating. Instead of confronting her about it and being like *""hey, why are you saying this when we're not seeing each other on a regular basis""*, I rolled with it and covered for her because I figured it would progress to something eventually, and I was worried about upsetting her and that she might hurt herself because I kind of knew where she was at emotionally. Wasn't a battle I thought I needed to fight at the time. In hindsight, this was the precursor to bigger problems.

We never saw each other consistently enough to label it dating, it was instead a sporadic summer fling stretched out over several years. However, she became increasingly infatuated/obsessive with each passing year, to the point where our message history gets unnaturally intense and starts deviating from what was actually happening in our relationship. I'm being told I'm the best thing that ever happened to her, but in all honesty I hardly saw this girl. By year three, she was so far gone, that she was calling in the middle of the night to apologize and dragging me into her room to have these really long, drawn-out, overly apologetic breakup/makeup talks, over a relationship and relationship issues that didn't exist anywhere except her own imagination.

She was essentially stalking me from the moment I got involved with her, and over a period of years role-played an entire relationship with me in her head that I then had to carefully manage and go along with in some manner so she didn't freak out and hurt herself.

I should have gone to the police and her parents as this was happening, but if the past two paragraphs are any indication, I had zero idea where to even begin aside from *""make sure she doesn't kill herself today.""*

Instead I waited an extra two years to get the police involved after a few more post-breakup incidents happened, and when I finally brought things to the authorities (and her parents), told a very ""soft"" version of events. The cops to their credit caught on to the actual story, on top of seeing her name in the database, and it's why they pushed me in the direction of a court order almost immediately.

The girl's family tried to smear me as a jealous stalker, which hurt me in ways they can't possibly comprehend. I genuinely wish they knew how this affected me because the way they treated me was unacceptable for the situation at hand, and for them to think I'm this insane loser bothers me a lot more than it probably should. I never asked to be a part of their daughter's mental health crisis masquerading as a relationship, still tried to handle it to the best of my abilities regardless, eventually lost patience, and now this random family thinks I'm insane for doing so. I have been waiting years for an apology I'll probably never get and it's hurtful beyond comprehension."

Really good friend from elementary decided in middle school that he was gonna try and fit in with a different crowd, began actively picking on my friends and I. The catch is that we still all car-pooled together at the end of the day and he'd pretend like nothing happened. This went on for the entire school year, then he just randomly moved away come summer break. It... never really bothered me. My mom remained upset for years.

Second story, got involved with a girl while admitted to an inpatient program my senior year of high school. I recovered from my mental health issues fairly quickly and the whimsical PSA's about mental health kind of encouraged me to take her under my wing and not give up on her. Kind of became a boyfriend/therapist hybrid which is obviously not healthy in the slightest but I was young and didn't know any better. Turns out she was a massive, and I mean *massive* whore, with a lengthy police record on par with some of the girls you see on Dr Phil, and I wasted a solid three years of my life letting her emotionally abuse me. People really do not understand how badly it messed with me and there are some things I'll take to the grave about that whole saga."

AskReddit,fopl3sf,t3_g8u026,1587964397.0,"Obscure answer: his role in the downfall of the USFL, the 80's spring football league in which he owned the New Jersey team. If you google ""Trump USFL"" it's just a constant barrage of MSM articles saying he ruined the USFL and is the sole reason the league folded.

Couldn't be farther from the truth.

The USFL was created with very strict instructions put forth by David Dixon; a $6 million operating budget per team, and an average attendance of \~23,500 would see the league be mildly profitable, leading to sustainability throughout the 80's.

The league didn't vet the owners properly and it turned into a massive shitshow. Half the owners didn't have the money they said they did and couldn't pay players (look up Steve Young's USFL contract for the most extreme example), others had *too much* money and upon seeing their team fall in the standings, spent like fucking crazy to sign every NFL Free Agent available and suddenly their operating budget was incomprehensibly deep in the red. The Michigan Panthers are the best example of this.

Trump was one of the few owners to actually keep his word and run a fairly decent team, but the writing was on the wall. Buying the Generals was not an ""investment"" as it was originally advertised to him, but a moneypit in a league that was going to die very quickly.

With the league bleeding money, the only option was to sue the NFL for violating anti-trust policies, and either hope for a merger, therefore giving him a return on his investment in buying a team since it's value would skyrocket upon turning into an NFL franchise, OR find the NFL guilty of violating anti-trust policies and be awarded a sum of cash to pay off the debts of the various owners.

The USFL/Trump actually *won* the lawsuit, but the jury I believe fucked up and didn't know how much money to award the USFL, so they gave the default value of like three dollars.

Trump is painted as the bad guy and the reason the league folded for *successfully winning a lawsuit necessary to keep the league afloat.* He had nothing to do with the monumental fuckup in $3.67 in damages awarded to the USFL, but is blamed for it anyways."

Had one against my dad for a year. I got kicked out of the house for racing go-karts on the street and was staying at my buddy's. About a month later Dad found out I was at my aunt's house one afternoon and showed up unannounced (odd, her and my dad don't get along and hadn't seen each other in at least 6 or 7 years), then tried to tell my aunt I was having a mental breakdown and had run away from home. What he didn't count on was that I had an audio recording of him kicking me out - my parents have a tendency to... be dishonest in times of stress - so I'd clicked record.

Upon realizing he got outsmarted by his own kid and was busted trying to run a smear campaign, he assaulted me then fled the house. Cops took care of everything and he was too much of a coward to even show up in court. Our relationship is fine now, we just don't have a lot in common so we don't talk much.

Second, I was involved with a girl suffering from borderline personality disorder in my late teens/early 20's. I don't think a backstory is necessary for this thread but let's just say I fell for the mental health propaganda pretty hard. Once she saw me as her therapist, all kinds of crazy shit came out about having anger problems, stalking her family when she was living away from them, being abused by family members, various assault charges, suicide threats, just not stable at all. I caught her cheating and ofc all hell broke loose, she was saying shit to me that just didn't make sense and this eventually stacked on top of her contacting my friends and family and just being really weird about it. Once she started asking people where I worked, I got scared. 

I manually applied for a court order & the girl and her dad reacted as you'd expect, just denied everything and tried to pin it all on me. Order granted regardless and it served its purpose. Girl eventually apologized years later which I thought was really nice."

I'm not gonna sit here and say he was my best friend or anything but he was a solid dude that everyone liked, we partied a few times together and I think I lent him a few Xbox games way back in the day. Hell we both posted on the same 4Chan forum. I honestly felt awful. On the 1-10 scale she's... maybe a 4 or a 5?
