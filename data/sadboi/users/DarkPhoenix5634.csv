unpopularopinion,fi2utvm,t1_fi2u008,1582089795.0,Yeah but if the child is both parents responsibility it only makes sense the both parents are in agreement if a woman is able to have or not have an abortion regardless of the father's intent doesn't it also stand to reason that the man is able to make their own choice on the matter it's a simpler problem with women because in that case its live or don't live with men it's a bit more complicated and if a woman is given the choice to not have to deal with a child so should the man since they can't physically have an abortion the next best thing is for the man to detach themselves financially and physically from the child and allow the mother to make their decision based on that information
unpopularopinion,fi2twz4,t1_fi2t5ky,1582088998.0,But that man didn't choose to have a child while the woman did so assuming the man took measures such as wearing a condom and advocated their feelings and the woman still decided to have that child she should be solely responsible men don't have that option they can't go back and see that a mistake was made and that they can't financially support a child or aren't in a stable place for a child so them advocating for either an abortion or adoption is their only go too and if the woman still decided to disregard them and move forward that should now be her child not their child
