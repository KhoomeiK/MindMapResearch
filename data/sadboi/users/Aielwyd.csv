MrRobot,fq9ag26,t3_ggyydg,1589191459.0,"1) I feel like Angela was so brainwashed, that even if Elliot confided that in her, she would continue to reinforce this other world as being the answer to reverse everything bad that has happened.

2) I dont think she would, but im unsure. I'm rewatching the series again atm. I would say it's possible, given her two faced interactions with Elliot and Mr.Robot, that she is capable of doing what is necessary to get what she wants.

3) I don't think she was jealous at all, nor do I think she thought of herself as a hero. Angela, like Elliot, continued to tell herself lies to cope with her trauma of losing her mother. I don't think she ever learned to have confidence in herself and her abilities, the way Darlene and Elliot are build off one another.  In a way, E Corp fostered that savage side of her, and because that leverage was created in the form of success, she took that opportunity.
