depression_help,fopodl2,t3_g8tjmw,1587967080.0,"Hi OP, thank you for sharing your story. 

I am no psychology expert and I don’t have education in the field, so what I can offer is my personal experience and knowledge. I think that you are going through depression, but you should look into more complex issues than just that. It sounds like you had lots of traumatic experiences throughout school, so I would look into CPTSD or PTSD. The constant “I fear I might be too dramatic” feel I get from your text suggest to me that you are dealing with lots of shame and guilt of yourself that no one person should have to deal with, and that shame is often a symptom of somebody who has been through a great deal of trauma.

If I were you I would also look into literature about being around narcissists. It sounds like the people you went to school with were dealing with some pretty nasty stuff internally, and instead of facing those feelings themselves they decided to take it out on you and make you feel bad about being just who you are. You are not responsible for their actions, nor are you any lesser just because they chose to be mean people.

I know that there are lots of barriers to seeking psychotherapy, but if you can afford to, you should try it. Do your research, find a therapist/counsellor that you can trust, and talk about the things that you’re going through with them. You should never have to worry about what your therapist thinks of you, it’s you who gets to be the judge. There are very good therapists out there who will cater their treatment uniquely to your style. It’s going to be a long journey, and it will be hard, but each step makes you that much more powerful as a person.

Lastly, don’t give up hope. You’re already so much stronger than the people who have been nasty to you by simply facing the problems you’re dealing with, instead of relaying the pain onto another innocent soul. If you feel like you need to talk, you’re welcome to message me."

But if you’re reading this OP, if you really love your brother, maybe do some research into depression, addiction, or other mental health issues, ask a therapist. Your brother sounds like he’s in a spiral, he’s possibly going through something mentally that you might not be aware of. If you really want to help him, offer to pay for therapist sessions for him for 6 months (of course you don’t have to), it’s guaranteed to be more helpful than sharing any of your wealth with him. At the end of the day he is not your enemy, and it sounds like you want him to do well.
