depression,fr4jk9i,t1_fr24t1c,1589890024.0,"Exactly. The word was corrupted in the eighties by salespeople to try and coerce you into buying things. Then, it got abused by the investment animals and then by politicians. Now, politicians have used it for a long time previous, but it got a resurgence in the eighties. The word has now been so corrupted that it no longer means what it used to. And, it gets used *way* too easily in situations where it really should not be used. Which leads us to today, where it means little or nothing anymore. I mean, I have heard people offer up that someone is a 'good friend' and they have known them for two weeks!

I suggest you go back to the original definition and see if it applies to the people you may think are your friends. I personally do not use it lightly and therefore do not have many friends. And, trust me, that is a good thing. A friend is one step below a significant other, so if you do not feel that someone is that close to you, then they are not a 'friend'."

Thirdly, I understand ow you feel, especially when you put forth the effort to try and remember theirs. Quick story here... So, way back I had to move back in with my dad because of my second breakdown, and it meant I had to move two hours away. I was really bummed out because all my 'friends' were where I was living. (The reason for the quotes will become obvious). I called them often, even though this was back when we had land lines and there was such a thing as long distance calling. I racked up a massive phone bill, so much so that my dad let the phone get disconnected until I paid it. It took a bit of time, but I did so and it was after the first call to one of my 'friends' that I had an epiphany. I decided to call each one and make sure to allow that I would await their calls. So, I did so, and I waited. And, I waited. AND, I WAITED. Guess how many finally did call... go on guess. That's right... NOT ONE. It was then that I learned a valuable lesson. The word 'friend' is used far too easily and far too broadly these days. I have had people tell me about their 'good friend', only to respond to the question, ""So, how long have you known him/her?"" with ""Oh, a couple of weeks."" RLY??? The point is this... if they cannot be bothered to remember something as basic as the general position of your birthday (and, based on what you are saying, I assume you have known them more than a few years), then they are not your 'friends', they are acquaintances. Acquaintances are not friends. I know this is not some feelygood reply here, but I always feel I need to point this out in the hopes you can learn from this and find real friends out there, and let those who cannot be bothered to put forth the effort to be a friend wander away. It is a painful lesson, but it is my hope you learn it sooner rather than later and then you can start finding real friends.

Tried it... came up with nothing... see, the world does not want me to fight for anything outside of what *they* want, and what *they* want is morally reprehensible. Not to mention just plain cruel and evil. So, now what?"

depression,fna0ajw,t1_fn9k2pw,1586788508.0,">It's common for people to realise at one point that most of their dreams will never come true and that they are set for an at best average life.

Is it common to also realize that the reason their dreams will never come true is due to societal tweaking and oppression by the wealthy who don't want the competition? And, that your dreams could come true but others won't let them because fuck you, I got mine? Why should I play such a corrupted and immoral game? So others don't have to see the flaws in the system? As stated above, I am supposed to be useful. Maybe this is the way to enlighten the sheeple to the reality of their societal situation..."

My message is the same as hers, yet no one is gathering outside my door to video me saying the exact same thing she did.

Then, why won't the world tell me this? why won't it listen? Where I come from, there is a common thought that if you put your hand on a hot stove, you will inadvertently get burned. If you keep on putting your hand on the stove, you are asking to get burned. You think I have not tried to offer help? No one listens because I am not making someone else money. I am not 'playing the game'... which is rotten and corrupted. Do you really think I want to keep banging my head against the wall on the off chance it might... *might.*.. crack a bit?

It is like comparing a cut on your leg to someone who was born without a leg and telling them it is the same thing. NO, it is not.

However, you may not realize just how ingrained the whole 'beauty=good and ugly=bad' mentality is in our society. What I am saying is that this standard is such a complete load of shiat that one would think that it would have gone the way of the civilization that spawned it. However, it seems to be a hard habit to break in some people. Bottom line, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Like musical taste, it has no right or wrong to it The fact that people try to imply a right or wrong about these topics just means they are up to something.

The difference is the former is usually temporary, the latter is a permanent disability just like blindness or MS. Yes, those who suffer from a temporary depressive episode can recover.

That has not been my experience. People could care less regardless of whether I am fighting to manage it or not. The only thing that happens is that people never forget it when you do lose it after being ignored and dismissed for too long. Humans do love to gossip after all. My advice? If you want to end it, make sure what you are doing will absolutely do the job. Unless you are absolutely sure, then I would suggest you find other options. The ONLY reason I am still here is I am too much of a coward to make the attempt. I hate pain, so I cannot find anything that can guarantee I won't suffer, so I am cursed to walk the earth a useless human who will never find peace in this life..."
