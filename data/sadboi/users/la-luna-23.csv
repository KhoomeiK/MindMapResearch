ThatsInsane,fh2aaze,t3_f0sdnx,1581242910.0,Well done
bipolar,fa15ys9,t3_e7gfij,1575765023.0,Love it! I use the app Huji (a crappy disposable camera effect) to play with light. You can get some interesting results playing with focus too!
bipolar,f9n6ial,t3_e60i8g,1575478056.0,"I try explaining this to my SO and others to no avail. 

Especially important too is that “family” is not always who you grew up in a house with or who gave birth to you."
bipolar,f97mql1,t3_e48hym,1575167659.0,I have before. I actually prefer it. It gets lonely but my favorite remedy is to go out and go to a book store. Hundreds of thousands of distractions and the added bonus of getting seen by a few people at least to remind you you’re alive. Hang in there
bipolar,f97mf6b,t1_f93k2zn,1575167546.0,"For your sake, I hope not!"
bipolar,f97mdp3,t1_f93ddz4,1575167531.0,I never get anything cool. Coolest was a rowing machine. Helped me lose ~30 lbs then I sold it 6 months later. Not a total loss I suppose
bipolar,f92s2am,t3_e30tcg,1575040194.0,Amazing!
bipolar,f92r6lh,t3_e3at4q,1575039591.0,Usually takes ~6 months to realize and by then I have another $3k in debt and live with my new girlfriend. I hate this fucking disease.
bipolar,f6nmwys,t3_ds6gk5,1572995088.0,Wow. Any for sale??!
bipolar,f661rmo,t3_dqdofu,1572707113.0,Hits hard
bipolar,f5yjvpj,t3_dpqz7f,1572557313.0,Congrats! Keep fighting
bipolar,f4ddmzv,t3_dkdosp,1571541199.0,"Same boat here. Almost daily, multiple times a day. Would also appreciate any input"
bipolar,f41k7y6,t3_dj6ngn,1571320408.0,"I do some freelance stuff and work from home. I am unmedicated and white knuckle it. When manic I fly thru projects, getting weeks of work done in hours. But when depressed, the thought of looking at a project makes me feel even more defeated. Since I control my pace and still always meet deadlines, I prefer it over face to face work any day. You just have to be sure you can manage your time wisely."
bipolar,f3zww3k,t3_dixdxf,1571278919.0,Love it
bipolar,f3fapqd,t3_dgvo22,1570893699.0,So cool
bipolar,f39v1sa,t3_dg77hw,1570756261.0,Not triggering but a really thorough look at mental illness. Especially mania and how it can alter how you perceive events. Definitely sad as hell
bipolar,f34wwlq,t3_dfh5hf,1570662708.0,"I gained nearly 60lbs while taking it for maybe 6 months. Held onto the weight for a year and a half after stopping. Had to cut back to chicken, rice, and water and work out like crazy for a month to lose anything. Lost about half in the end, but now am a healthy weight as previously I was super under weight. Fuck that drug"
KitchenConfidential,f2ts3di,t3_de1z6w,1570399614.0,Congrats!
bipolar,f2dq3pf,t3_dd1qvu,1570161149.0,"I understand exactly how you feel. I feel it every day. The only thing that keeps me going is the belief, however deep it may be buried, that all the suffering is worth something. 

I read a quote once.. “tomorrow will be the best day of your life”. The trick is, you have to be here to see it. 

I won’t lie and say it’s easy or even that it’s immediately worth it. But I have faith, as should you, that one day it will all make sense. That you’ll pause and look at your life and these feelings you feel now will seem foreign to you. 

Hold on."
bipolar,f2dpmjj,t3_dd1tvx,1570160772.0,"My experience is that the majority of people don’t understand it. The seem to broach conversations “knowing” it will “make me mad”, and instead of the consideration ever being that maybe the ask is the problem, it is written off that I’m at fault because I’m “moody”. Even those that know me well and that know seem to trivialize it. 

I would say keep it close to the chest. My direct supervisor I have known for 8 years, I spend holidays with him and his family...and he is still guilty of the above."
bipolar,f2dp361,t3_dd0cm3,1570160326.0,"I struggle with that thought often. The jury is still out for me. I know I could be an amazing father, but I would never want my children to carry the sadness and weight that I do."
bipolar,f2dm724,t1_f2caov0,1570157979.0,"Thank you for the kind words. It kills me every day and I guess I’ve tried the past few years to give her distance and I’ve tried to move on with other people but he’s always there in the back of my mind. The thing is if she showed up at my door tomorrow, I know I would drop everything for her. And I don’t think that feeling will ever go away. 

I don’t know how much of that I can attribute to my illness though. And that’s what scares me. The more I’ve become aware of and read about the actual symptoms of bipolar behavior, I find myself second guessing everything I do and feel."
bipolar,f2dlx6p,t1_f2d7n1m,1570157763.0,"Wow, I really needed this. Thank you so much. My biggest issue with it was always the uncertainty of it. I kick myself because I realize in hindsight now how wrong it was of me to like you said crowd her and spill everything out and at times almost offer an ultimatum. 

I really value everything you said and really hope I can have the chance to talk to her about it again soon. She still comes back to the area every now and then, but we do have very different and separate lives. I guess another fear of mine is that she’s so far removed that maybe even if it was real at a point it’s all history for her. For me it never ended."
bipolar,f2d45y6,t3_dcyi0d,1570146865.0,"I can’t imagine what that is like. My days are either entirely miserable, can barely leave the house, or they start that way and end just so-so."
bipolar,f1jz7pz,t3_d9g71i,1569529770.0,Me right now lol
bipolar,ez9h3n5,t3_d08j3c,1567782130.0,Wow. This is amazing!
bipolar,ersj3rr,t3_c3j8hv,1561215565.0,"Wow I’ve always felt like I’ve been the only person I knew that hated their birthday. A lot of disappointing birthdays growing up, and it just feels contrived to me. Hate the fake attention. I refuse to tell anyone my birthday now."
bipolar,ersiqo8,t3_c3q318,1561215258.0,Love this!
bipolar,eq3l0mi,t3_bx257m,1559757994.0,One of my songs got added to a playlist on Spotify with 200k followers! Making music has always been the only way I could be honest about how I feel. It’s always been really hard on me when people weren’t excited about my music like I was. It’s nice to have some recognition after so many years of setbacks and disappointment.
