CasualConversation,fqz0o9e,t1_fqyyhet,1589757817.0,"Ah, I see. Income property is much less prone to valuation swings than single family homes. This is in part because the value of the property is based more on the rents it can generate.

There will very likely be a fall in housing values soon though. That is pretty much assumed by most market analysts, economists, and even those in real estate that I know personally.

Only you can determine whether this is a good investment for you. If you only care about the situation (ownership, location, security) and think you can continue receiving the same rents you currently do, as well as continue being employed and able to pay the mortgage otherwise, then sure, do it. Just be psychologically prepared to be paying back a mortgage more expensive than your property for a while.

Very long-term Seattle real estate should remain one of the strongest markets. I already know people moving from my area (Bay Area, CA) to Washington because of climate change.

Although there are many economists projecting near-term deflation (paying back your debt with more valuable dollars than the dollars loaned), many are also projecting significant inflation (paying back your debt with less valuable dollars) in the long term.

Just be aware you are buying very near the tippy-top of the market. If you plan to be there long-term and it's worth it to lock it down now, then fine. But make sure you consider your ability (and the sacrifices/opportunity cost) to keep paying the mortgage through at least a 2009-10 level of economic downturn. Many are projecting this next one will be worse."

oakland,fqxxyd8,t1_fqxupbl,1589739541.0,"Nah, it's pretty obvious. I saw this same thing in SF, although it's a little different there. In SF the city auditor would just be similarly corrupt instead of under budgeted.

The main problem is a concept I call ""fiefdoms"" - areas of administrative or managerial authority where there is no oversight or accountability to public interest. This fosters an environment for laziness, incompetence, or outright corruption among the administrators. Then the fish rots from the head down and you get things like that building inspector guy a year or so ago who was caught taking payoffs.

I don't know the exact budget of the city, but it seems that with the high property taxes and property values there is no reason schools and police should be so underfunded.

It doesn't help that so much governance and taxation/budget allocation is delegated to the ballot. It doubly doesn't help when voters vote against something and then the city council or mayor's office tries to say it passed anyways(misprint on the ballot and election guide my ass). This  leads to court challenges and another major avenue for corruption in this city - lawyers.

The legal industry has inserted itself into too much of Oakland governance. The huge amount and convoluted nature of city by-laws make it so that lawyers are necessary to resolve even the most basic disputes.

It's all bullshit."
