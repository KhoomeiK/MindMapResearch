 Talk to your parent or anotherggg  adult that you trust about how you’re feeling and ask to be seen by a mental health professional.  Therapists are a dime a dozen and can’t prescribe medication it psychiatrists do. 

Hope that helps. I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this."

Yesterday morning my ex-wife accused me of being paranoid and asked if I’ve been taking my bi-polar meds when I told her she really needs to stock up on supplies. It really pissed me off and made me feel like I trust her less. I started preparing 3 weeks ago and have been VERY quiet about it because I knew people weren’t ready to face the situation yet and would be unsupportive.  I felt really foolish he first time I filled a shopping cart to the brim...until an older black lady in the produce aisle took a double take at me cart and said “Mmmm, I’m gonna go home with YOU!”  I haven’t felt foolish about it since.  I take a lot of comfort in how well I’ve prepared, that helps when I feel isolated. Yesterday, after work I went straight to the bank and took out $3000 in twenties. Again.....I felt a little foolish (I was genuinely concerned that it would be a problem to get that many 20’s), but the guy in line behind me, at an appropriate distance thankfully, remarked that it was a really good idea to ask for all 20’s. People are waking up now that schools are closing. Hang in here, if you need someone to talk to feel free to pm me."
