So, you steal about a minute, of the remaining time!!, when defuser is dropped. Also: You can use 1-2 Smoke canisters during the round, not just at the end. If you decide to ‚Äûnot waste‚Äú a smoke early and you die, you were just useless. You are pretty much the strongest Operator in the game, if played optimal (IMO of course). You can do AoE damage, deny time, deny complete pushes, deny defuser or a plant effective, and deny a revive whilst getting the safe kill. Also: dont preplace your smokes. It‚Äôs the worst thing you can do. They are easily detected and shot. Also: Try to find a place on every Obj, from where ypu are able to throw a smoke to almost amywhere at Objective. As example: Bank. (I‚Äôd say the best smoke map besides Coastline). Top floor hold: You just sit in the connector, reinforce 1 wall, make both rotates, put a shield towards the entrance, open up top level holes and boom: You can literally throw a smoke everywhere on Top florr, except Desk. So, as you see, efficiency of your operator comes from movement, good knowledge when to throw your smokes and being ‚Äûeverywhere on site, any time‚Äú. Smokes presence is enough to make every plant horrible. Play arround the psychology of smoke. (Thats the advanced shit tbh)"
