baltimore,fr5sqkm,t3_gm1gyi,1589914033.0,"If you plan to buy in Hamilton, I'd definitely rent there first to see if you like it as another poster said.  I lived in Hampden for 5 years and loved it, I planned to buy there. However, I didn't end up finding anything in my price range that I loved or offered enough space for me, my SO, and our pets.

I ended up buying in Hamilton 2 weeks ago and I love it. The neighborhood I bought in feels very hampden-ish, without the wide array of little shops/bars/etc. There are enough off of Harford Road but I haven't gotten a chance to try many besides a few carry out orders. I have already made friends will all of my neighbors. But, when I was house hunting, there were definitely certain areas of Hamilton that weren't as nice. So yeah, I'd definitely rent and get a better idea!

I can't answer for the water bill as we haven't received one yet and we are living in a single family home so it would be different than a condo. & yes it would be easier to get from Hampden to Mt Vernon, but from Hamilton to Mt.Vernon is only a 20 min drive and you don't have to hop on the highway at all.  Hamilton may be a bit out of the way as some are saying, but personally I've found it to be very convenient to the places I frequently visit (or was frequently visiting...haven't been leaving the house much lately obviously.)

Edit: a word."
MDEnts,fr31hh8,t1_fr30i6o,1589848046.0,One of my favorites that I tried recently was a Willie’s. It still gave me a bit of a head high but not too much. Thank you I’ll definitely check that one out.
MDEnts,fr1yxi4,t1_fr1yqgs,1589828300.0,great thanks for the suggestion!
MDEnts,fr1yvsa,t1_fr1xioq,1589828277.0,"I've had Curio gummies once that I liked but they were so expensive. Will definitely look into making my own, thank you!"
MDEnts,fr1yswf,t1_fr1x6ep,1589828237.0,"Yeah I hear you. I try to buy when they have a deal but overall most edibles seem to be pretty pricey, especially if you're consuming them a few times a day."
MDEnts,fr1ykmw,t1_fr1x5o8,1589828124.0,"I'll be honest I don't have a strain that I smoke consistently, I usually buy whatever is on sale to try. I'm trying to remember one I really liked, I think it was the Airopro Berry Gelato, an indica.

I need to do a better job at keeping track of the strains that I like, I've kinda dropped the ball on that."
MDEnts,fr1y534,t1_fr1h0q2,1589827913.0,"That's a great idea, thank you. Now just to find my usual dosage for edibles haha, still experimenting with that."
MDEnts,fr1y2w4,t1_fr1guve,1589827883.0,I'm glad to hear that it worked for you. Which brand of troches do you use?
Pets,fr1xpn4,t3_gm5pxy,1589827699.0,"Glucose over 500 extremely high, I am extremely surprised that the vet did not start insulin ASAP. 

Please do not blame yourself that you didn't press for the insulin, the vet dropped the ball on this. When my cat was diagnosed with diabetes, I believe his glucose was in the 200s and they still started insulin right then and there in the office, instructed us on how to administer the insulin, and sent us home with a full bottle to continue dosing. 

That being said I am so SO sorry for your loss. Again please do not blame yourself, it was not your job to push the vet to give your cat insulin. That was the vet's job and I cannot begin to fathom why they did not administer the insulin immediately."
MDEnts,fr1btx2,t1_fr1b3og,1589816969.0,"I have been using pens up until recently but they tend to give me a very heady high, even in small doses. I prefer the body high of edibles as I don’t find it affects my work performance like the head high does. Maybe I just haven’t found the right one yet. You are right though, much easier to dial in the dosage with the pen. The search continues!"
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,fqm22ml,t3_gjlmmw,1589470161.0,Is this your loan estimate or your closing disclosure? I'm going to guess loan estimate since you aren't closing until 7/1. The loan officer/processor do their best to estimate but loan estimates aren't always 100% accurate. I imagine that the title fees will come down once the lender balances their figures with the title company.
homeowners,fqlyoe7,t3_gjbv9o,1589468462.0,"YES! I won't be having kids and marriage was never that important to me, so buying a house seemed like the next step. I saved and saved and saved with a goal of buying before I turned 30. I browsed Zillow/Redfin/Trulia obsessively for the past 2-3 years.

Just closed last week (2 months after my 30th birthday, but close enough!) 

The house doesn't feel like ""home"" just yet and furnishing/decorating it is expensive (even with buying used furniture from Marketplace/Craigslist/etc. ) so it'll take some time to get there but I am the happiest I have been in quite some time. I have actual space to do things! (I was previously renting a 700 square foot rancher with my boyfriend, 2 large dogs, and 2 cats.) 

I had panic attacks every night leading up to the closing date, wondering if I had made the right decision but all of the stress melted away as soon as I moved in. Sure, there will be many stressors in the future that I will have to deal with but I'm ready for them. I've prepared myself for all of this. Feels good, man."

Rooting hormone, ok got it never heard of that before. 

We’ve got a sectioned off garden bed, but it’s kind of trashy right now with bricks & debris. Pretty sure it used to be the previous owners garden by the way it’s situated. 

Any suggestions for good plants to start off with? Eventually I’d like to grow my own vegetables but I understand that requires a bit of patience."
Frugal,fqfk69m,t1_fqfjqoa,1589326363.0,Thank you! I work in the mortgage industry & look at HOI daily. I feel pretty confident about the one that I chose based on the price and reviews. I did extremely extensive research & was probably on the phone at least 2 hours everyday getting quotes lol.
Frugal,fqfjz13,t1_fqff5eq,1589326260.0,"Exactly that! I have 4 pets, one of which is a bully breed. I looked for months for a place to rent that would even accept 2 large at all, let alone 2 large dogs & 2 cats. Most places only accepted cats & small dogs. Had I found one, the pet deposits + pet rent would have been astronomical. 

Oh yes don’t even get me started on the locks! Many trips to Home Depot were made lol."
