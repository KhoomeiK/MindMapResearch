drawing,fqkzn4c,t3_gjhbk6,1589441228.0,I would recommend watching some tutorials you really need to fix proportions
virtualreality,fpygu8a,t3_gg9w37,1589003666.0,Easily
virtualreality,fk10kr4,t1_fk0h38b,1583770061.0,Still even disagree with that since you can find windows mr on sale for 200$ Wich is probably better price for performance
virtualreality,fk013ci,t3_ffqg06,1583736964.0,Windows mr is a great starting point if your not sure you will use it consistently I would recommend the ofddysey plus the rift s had better tracker but a worse screen and audio and the index is the best you can get but is really expensive my recommendation would be to start off with windows mr maybe find one on sale for like 230 and if you really enjoy it get the index
virtualreality,fk00z4w,t1_fk006zw,1583736821.0,Yes and no price for performance it is quite good bang for the buck but you saying it's hard to find something better is not true a index is quite a bit better pricey but still not hard to find something better if you have the money
drawing,fh6wyhp,t1_fh6wkum,1581308233.0,You don't ask for drawings and you didn't even asj nicely  if you go on r/free normally some people are offering free drawings but this is the wrong sub Reddit xD
OculusQuest,fh6wrkl,t3_f1kq3d,1581308091.0,Ok dude that's a huge amount not alot my ass why TF would you even want 8k the quest doesn't support no one is going to costom develop your wierd ass dragon fantasy and waste there time on it I'm sure some laying down experinces will be added but this is a huge amount to ask for if you actually wanted this you can hire someone to do it otherwise go back to r/choosingbeggars
drawing,fh6wils,t3_f1ktb4,1581307903.0,Not how that works
OculusQuest,fgry433,t3_f07834,1581062215.0,Not sure how to fix other than maybe finding a Dev to make you a costom program to edit height or maybe try running it through revive but I don't think that will work but maybe worth a shot
OculusQuest,fgry0cy,t3_f0794z,1581062087.0,Your best bet would be to try buying some comfort pads and a counterweight for it or upgrade to a vive deluxe audio strap
oculus,fgrxxry,t3_f079lk,1581061999.0,Maybe try putting some paper in next to it to keep it tight then tape it down maybe super glue while you hold it down anything like that should keep it going for a bit just make sure that part doesn't get pulled on
virtualreality,fgnlnqc,t1_fgibbzq,1580947518.0,Yeah but most of the higher quality games aren't crossbuy beatsaber etc. crossbuy does have a few good games like robo recall and a few others but I would still stand by my quote that a lot of the games you will want to play especially bigger ones aren't cross buy
virtualreality,fghx5l1,t3_eyjocy,1580796643.0,Most games aren't crossbuy so you would have to buy it once on the quest store and once on the rift store then use revive with virtual desktop to stream the games to your quest so no for most games you would have to buy them twice no matter what
OculusQuest,fghd7jk,t1_fghd0cm,1580782228.0,Library is a good idea that would probably help a lot of people like op
OculusQuest,ffsy3fd,t1_ffsy1lv,1580197325.0,Yeah Im really close to beating expert + but for now just have to stick with harder experts lol the expert + wipes me out after a few tries
oculus,ffsxyua,t3_ev2bal,1580197162.0,As long as the circle doesn't interfer any grips for the new oculus touch will work for the old one they literally just flipped the too circle and called it a new controllers it's exactly the same as the old one
OculusQuest,ffsxwnt,t3_ev2cx4,1580197087.0,Oh I can't wait until you try expert + if you think this is hard and spend countless hours trying to beat a expert + song
KindVoice,ffpmwij,t3_euipdu,1580099064.0,U can hmu
virtualreality,ffk2v73,t1_ffjg8ii,1580014112.0,True definitely go index if you don't have average ipd since there is no real ipd on the rift s honestly if Facebook put as much time as they put into the quest into the rift s it could have been a contender with the index since the quest had the same screens basically as the index but they are oled and support 90hz Wich is enough for most people kinda sad they just basically gave lenevo the electronics and said make a cheap body for it xD it is still a good pcvr headset but it could have been so much better if Facebook actually cared about it
virtualreality,ffirinf,t1_ffgr6ef,1579980902.0,Text should be a lot clearer since it has quite a bit more resolution but yeah it's not a higher jump main things are audio is wayyyyyyyy better than rift s built in a lot better comfort and the 120hz is quite noticable 80hz isn't a deal breaker but it is noticably less smooth than 120 or 140 the rift s is a great budget headset but don't act like it compares to the index
virtualreality,ffejo0i,t1_ffe4g11,1579850780.0,Quest is quite cool but for pcvr it's not very comfortable for long play sessions and it does have a slight delay compared to real pcvr like index and rift s also the rift s has quite a bit lower resolution then index and lower 70hz compared to 144hz but for budget the rift s and quest are probably the best you can get for 400$ and like you said windows mr is great since you can get a Odyssey + on sale for 230$ but if you want real pcvr the rift s is better than quest of you don't care about portability and if you have the money index is better so price point 200$ windows mr 400$ rift s 1000$ valve index
virtualreality,ffegkeh,t1_ffedpvi,1579847171.0,I think the rift s and quest are great budget headsets just don't like Facebook he asked for reccomendation and I said I have heard good things of the rift s just wouldn't buy it personally since it's made by Facebook not bashing people did so chill
virtualreality,ffe4qab,t1_ffdji9d,1579836650.0,Np
virtualreality,ffdhisi,t3_et179p,1579820987.0,I mean the index is the best headset currently available so I would recommend that or maybe find a cheap used Vive then later down the line you can upgrade to index controllers if money is a problem I have heard good things about the rift s but I personally hate Facebook and would never consider it xD
oculus,ffbbtgh,t3_esouux,1579758887.0,No but the tracking is pretty close to as good as the cv1 it will never be as good but it's really close and doubt you will notice and most people say it's good enough
virtualreality,ff5icko,t1_ff53i43,1579594215.0,Yeah but he wants something better than Vive and a quest comfort I'd pretty bad without mods and he wants to play games that you want to play for a long time at once do doubt he would want to go quest it's still not a real replacement for pcvr
WindowsMR,ff46tn5,t3_erjmt7,1579556806.0,Idk maybe the cable broke have you tried unplugging the cable and back into the headset and PC if that doesn't work try it on a different PC
virtualreality,ff46k4q,t3_erk11c,1579556644.0,Currently only the vive pro has wireless and yes the vive pro supports index controllers and 2.0 base station and the vive pro has the same resolution as the index and better colors because it's oled compared to the indexes lcd display
iamatotalpieceofshit,femaro4,t1_felxgpr,1579246340.0,Yeah honestly they sound pretty bad it's shitty to try to kill them but you need to train your dogs to stop barking or your going to get noise complaints and them taken away barking at a doorbell is one thing but constantly barking isn't acceptable and biting definitely isn't
SuicideWatch,fej7ww8,t1_fej7aew,1579160680.0,Oh I'm sorry and you can still feel better if you can make it through the low then you can go into the high just keep trying pushing against it fight it with all your will get help make freinds vent
SuicideWatch,fej76tu,t3_epg1v8,1579159757.0,Hey it's ok can you tell me what's wrong?
KindVoice,feikpb3,t3_epck6g,1579140780.0,Hey you can message me
oculus,feecdym,t1_fee38mq,1579030859.0,Then rift s is better
oculus,fee37m3,t1_fedzwng,1579025459.0,That's fair I mean it's significantly better but it is really expensive haha if you have a pc rift s is better than quest
oculus,fedznhf,t3_eonua8,1579023258.0,I mean index has better more useful finger tracking haha
selfharm,fed1q9d,t1_febqvrz,1578994309.0,No one cares if I do I just hate doing it in front of my family
selfharm,febo5zl,t3_eocybu,1578960957.0,Same try not to ever cry
virtualreality,fe86fo1,t3_eo41we,1578923061.0,Valve index is the best consumer one
WindowsMR,fe6qqaj,t1_fe6q6fk,1578900947.0,Should if you make your build it PC part picker it will tell you how much power it will use
WindowsMR,fe6qou6,t3_eo0uae,1578900895.0,Yeah the camera have nothing to identify where they are you could also try putting up a poster or something with shard edges in front of you on that wall would probably fix it
WindowsMR,fe6pzy1,t3_eo0um7,1578900018.0,Looks like the Rx outperforms them all although you get a significant performance boost if you can get the 5700xt
virtualreality,fe6nnsz,t3_eo0ezr,1578897236.0,I would recommend finding a windows Mr that's onsale for around 200$
virtualreality,fdycyrr,t3_enddpt,1578778407.0,From what I heard 5he newer stock is better and even if they break valve will fix it for free people say it's annoying when it happens but still worth it since there currently the best controller you can get other than maybe the gloves that let you feel stuff haha
OculusQuest,fdwq9mj,t1_fdwln20,1578761349.0,I honestly don't believe that seems like it would have at least 50ms of latency Wich would make you suck
OculusQuest,fdvy50h,t1_fdvke3b,1578753095.0,Does he mean shadow PC like shadow box that's a cloud pc thousands of miles away if so the latency would be horrible and I don't think it would work
drawing,fduai35,t3_en4pbm,1578730394.0,Wish I had money to give gold
drawing,fduafwk,t3_en4pbm,1578730364.0,I really like this
OculusQuest,fdu9l0c,t3_en4nh0,1578729944.0,That's never gonna work the latency would be wayy to high you would get sick instantly
KindVoice,fdtvas4,t1_fdtuo5y,1578722776.0,I'm fine with PM's on Reddit or texting don't really like calling tho pretty shy haha
KindVoice,fdtq1if,t3_en38hb,1578720434.0,Hey you can talk to me
theofficememes,fds12ih,t3_emxbxb,1578692646.0,Ok daz fucked up but also hilarious
virtualreality,fdpxefi,t3_emnu5e,1578644560.0,I think how it works actually required your eyes to focus in the distance for stuff far away just like real lifen
drawing,fdmg0hs,t3_em3q17,1578548652.0,When you have to french your mug to drink coffee this post made by the water bottle gang
drawing,fdmfse2,t3_em440x,1578548444.0,Vader looks buff and haha
oculus,fdmfq65,t3_em4abt,1578548387.0,You probably should have gotten a vive s index if you wanted full body tracking for it you will need 2 base stations the vive trackers and probably special software to make it work with the rift
drawing,fdje25j,t3_elp9nt,1578466943.0,More shading looks really blank it's a good line art tho
virtualreality,fdi8wg0,t3_elinv4,1578437843.0,Yeah for sure my PC is way below the specs and run VR fine you should be able to run it great
virtualreality,fdi8tll,t1_fdi3y20,1578437804.0,He should be fine I run a Pentium g4560 and can run Pavlov
OculusQuest,fdi8ahm,t3_elivw8,1578437522.0,Don't think so the tracking rn is pretty bad on it
drawing,fdi86re,t3_elix4r,1578437468.0,The hair looks good just fix the head proportions and make the eyes more vibrant
oculus,fdi803e,t3_elj0l9,1578437375.0,No any real PC VR shouldn't since it has a direct connection to the gpu
oculus,fdi7n9m,t3_elj6tr,1578437190.0,Probably not and most laptops don't work with PC VR like Vive and rift s unless you plan on building a gaming PC quest
oculus,fdi7c0p,t1_fdhyzed,1578437022.0,I think it will be ok I have seen Vive content posted here to
oculus,fdhyu79,t3_eli11a,1578432648.0,Funny haha although may not fit in oculus since it's psvr
drawing,fctmh33,t3_eiuwo0,1577948917.0,Looks but pretty sure there's a rule saying your not allowed to ask people to fallow you
oculus,fctmdws,t3_eiuxqb,1577948808.0,I have a vive and im in this group no one cares what you own even if you don't have any vr headsets some people like to just read the new posted here so yes
virtualreality,fcskxan,t3_einvq6,1577918681.0,Lmaooo
WindowsMR,fcsddcx,t3_eio8rs,1577914965.0,Sounds like driver issues and you definitely don't want to play vr at 60hz
OculusQuest,fc7s9qx,t3_egnjfv,1577517341.0,Looks like a rip off of the vr cover version
virtualreality,fc7s0y8,t3_egnpoo,1577517143.0,Sounds like your PC is lagging you mean the black circle if you turn your head quickly if so that's lag because it's can't keep up
virtualreality,fc7dh7w,t1_fc6zols,1577504205.0,Then you would love a vive or something with full tracking
virtualreality,fc6yy3n,t3_egj6t9,1577493113.0,Try someone else's and see if it's worth it for you
oculus,fc6yr3u,t3_egjc05,1577492966.0,Add lone echo and echo combat half life alyx pre-order and gorn
virtualreality,fc66ij7,t1_fc5hlvh,1577473395.0,Built mine at 13 it's really not that hard just some screwing and popping stuff in kinda like Legos there's no soldering or anything complicated only thing you have to be careful really is putting the CPU into the socket gently but it's quite easy I bet you could do it easily just don't buy a clear case so you don't see that crappy cable management haha
oculus,fb9wyym,t3_ec93k3,1576653281.0,The grip size should be the exact same since all they did was reuse the exact same design just invert the ring
iamatotalpieceofshit,fb9s8i2,t3_ec8fi7,1576647960.0,I'm gonna be fucking sick
oculus,f9rv0do,t1_f9rt874,1575581677.0,They are fine for a starter headset and the controls and plenty good enough for most games yeah it's not as good as a rift s quest or Vive but it's way cheaper and if it's kids there not gonna know the difference and it's a Christmas present 400$ is insane windows mr is still a viable budget headset
oculus,f9rnsrd,t3_e6n8uy,1575578851.0,Maybe check out windows mixed reality you can find them used for 100$ and they go on sale pretty often for quite cheap
SuicideWatch,f9p5o66,t3_e6bcfa,1575522481.0,Not gonna help end someone's life I really hope you don't do it if you ever need to talk just feel free to just hmu
theofficememes,f9p5kjr,t3_e6bd3x,1575522392.0,Where how why
virtualreality,f9n0kji,t1_f9mg2of,1575474387.0,Whatever fanboy
virtualreality,f9l5v17,t1_f9l4d1u,1575415166.0,Yeah but he wants budget and og is a great starter rift s is also good but has no upgradability and yes index is way better than both that's why I said he/she could upgrade of they wanted to index controllers then eventually the index
virtualreality,f9l3ec3,t3_e5ncg0,1575413533.0,If you want upgradability Vive since later down the line you can get index controllers and slowly upgrade
OculusQuest,f9klu1l,t1_f9kbnur,1575403109.0,Oh there isn't I thought there was maybe try an emulated called bluestacks
OculusQuest,f9kbcfd,t3_e5l2a3,1575396869.0,Your better of grabbing a rift s if your planning on playing bigger games pretty sure it's still on sale rn to
OculusQuest,f9kb539,t1_f9k3nh1,1575396744.0,I guess but if your using a quest your more than likely to be at home and have a pc you can use or a laptop I doubt Microsoft will add support maybe some modder will make a patch to add support for quest
OculusQuest,f9k3l30,t3_e5jq5o,1575392053.0,What would be the point of running it on quest better of just using a phone and Xbox controller
SuicideWatch,f9fbmjd,t3_e4ugg3,1575265466.0,Hey  I care and first don't you want to see if you can find a wife/husband and try living life the fullest extent before you go once you do there's no turning back so make sure you try the get everything out of life try everything make friends hobbies kids love etc I hope you don't end up going if you need to talk or vent or anything at all just hmu
virtualreality,f8aabwb,t1_f839b6e,1574391859.0,Hey did you grab a rift s if so how are your first impressions of vr?
WindowsMR,f83j4xv,t3_dys4ki,1574213184.0,Maybe beatsaber but I'm on a 1050 and it can barely run the harder beatsaber songs on an og Vive I would recommend a used 970 there only 50-80$ used if you already have one and are planning on getting vr that would work temporarily until you upgrade
virtualreality,f83ia46,t1_f839b6e,1574212659.0,Ok have fun I just got a og Vive personally and am loving that got it used for 275 and am gonna upgrade to index controllers at some point have fun with vr
virtualreality,f838sdm,t1_f835kas,1574206837.0,I hate Facebook but from what I have heard the rift s is superior to the vive cosmos so maybe that and upgrade your PC with your remaining money
virtualreality,f835413,t3_dyshoz,1574204549.0,I would say valve index if possible since it's not much more and will give you the best experience in the market that it maybe a vive pro and then buy some index controllers to go with it if not rift s
depression,f8107h9,t3_dyfro3,1574144315.0,Hey I don't know how I could help but if you ever need to talk or vent or anything just hmu
selfharm,f80zyzg,t3_dyfvls,1574144046.0,I hope you didn't end up cutting it you need to talk I'm here 🥴
OculusQuest,f80zrr2,t1_f80xffi,1574143821.0,Valve makes there own headsets there's no reason for them to make one for and oculus only device since they already support it on steam vr
oculus,f7iin60,t3_dwej48,1573760162.0,Yeah it uses the same games just tell him not to break the cord because they don't sell them anymore
selfharm,f7ar6xh,t3_dv5grq,1573537182.0,Yeah I used to punch myself in the face but had to stop because it left a huge bruise on the side of my face and people got suspicious
depression,f6rxim5,t1_f6rtxle,1573121884.0,That's super fucking offensive and will just make people feel worse
selfharm,f63pbmz,t3_dqh3a1,1572681222.0,Not that I know of but they take a while to disapear so if you need to wear shortsleeves I wouldn't recommend it
