INTP,fo9mort,t3_g5urgu,1587624110.0,"I was a nervous kid and that built up to me having quite a few panic attacks. I'm lucky to have reduced my anxiety with exposure and will continue to do so. 

I think introverts tend to be anxious. Social situations can sometimes be draining because of the stress of physical and psychological stress of handling anxiety. It doesn't help that society treats introvert and shy as the same word.

Now I have begun to reject the word shy as I worked past most of my people based fear. I am almost resentful of the word introvert because introvert culture is annoying as hell. I love being around people, it feels amazing. Yet I can entertain myself without going crazy. It's not always black and white."
INTP,fo9m9kx,t3_g58iv7,1587623730.0,I'm quite an asshole about this. I don't think I'm as smart as I am stuck-up. Again realizing this fact won't stop me from engaging in these behaviors. It doesn't help that I am usually right because I am more suited to schooling than most and enjoy looking up various topics. I will continue to be a smartass until something forces me to change.
INTP,fo9m1zp,t3_g5wfdp,1587623543.0,"I have depression but I'm still shown to be an INTP. My depression does cloud my thinking and make me a lot more emotional, but I treat it ""rationally"". I try to justify my self-loathing and self-destructive behaviors. Even before I was diagnosed, I was analyzing my emotions try to track them and learn about them. I thought about them extensively to describe them to myself and others. I argued with myself over if I was depressed, even writing essays over it. I even convinced myself that my depression was the truth and wrote essays about why life would always be terrible. I tried to ignore or cure it myself. 

I've always been a strong thinker (called an overthinker by my friends) and still am while depressed. But I do experience periods of higher moods that are potentially BPII, so that may influence things."

Also, they may value that stability because they know when they have free time. The 9-5 is often just tolerable, but they are working for something else. The lucky few like their jobs. Not everyone is willing to throw themselves into a passion. So many people don't even have real hobbies, just tv. Some people don't desire creativity or aren't in touch with it. 

Hell, if I wasn't mentally ill, I likely wouldn't consider any other options. It is easy to stay locked inside your box unless your hand is forced."

The rational trans community seems like it wants to help and support, but they lose sight of the possibility that their unconditional support can cause harm. I believe that support should also encourage with questioning and therapy. 

I'm glad your girlfriend was able to get better before going further down the path of transitioning."
detrans,fiz7bc1,t1_fiy4jb5,1582855856.0,"The public's low expectation of dads characterizes them as fun or lazy parents. Both roles require a lot less effort and stress than the expectation of a mother. While the world attempts to be more progressive, these expectations are firmly rooted in society. There continue to be man-children, absent fathers, and fathers who play the fun parent because they don't want to discipline or do more work. When I think of myself as a husband, father, or uncle, I mean to convey I feel more comfortable with the titles. I don't want to be a lazy stereotype, which undoubtedly would be easier, I view this idea as part of a greater drive to be socially male. 

A medical transition will undoubtedly limit my life, but I am currently limited as well through not being able to live as I please. It is not destroying my life, but it does affect me and has affected me for a lot of my short life. I see the net effect being positive in this case. Also, the monetary trade-off is worth it, as I value day-to-day life over big trips. I will deal with the effect one week as a time when the future comes.  It is not the ideal life (where I have endless wealth, friends, and no gender identity conflict) but it is close and I see myself being content. 

I am worried about being in a medicalized body when I could avoid it, while some people cannot. I desire the changes but am looking into my future options so I can minimize risk and difficulty. I acknowledge both will be present but I will attempt to mitigate if I can. I have also seen transmen takes breaks from HRT without significant changes, so this could be an option. I will have to talk more with a doctor, in the future. 

I will try to slow down. I struggle with uncertainty but I can't rush discovering myself, so I am going to experiment. 

Thanks again for your long and thoughtful replies. They have helped me analyze my motivations and future."

I don't struggle with sensory processing, meltdowns, or social cues/interactions. I do struggle with other mental health issues, like mood swings, depression, and anxiety, which I am receiving treatment for now. 

I know I can never change my sex, that is science. I wish to change my gender, which doesn't mean removing all feminine aspects of me and my life or strongly adhering to masculine gender roles. I enjoy feminine interests like art and fashion. I just want to present physically and be treated as a male in my future. I want to make sure that desire is pure and free from negative external influences, so I can decide if social and/or medical transition will positively affect me.

This sub has taught me a lot that I otherwise wouldn't know because many people blindly support a medical transition. I found that I've got the most responses on this sub because people want to help me in my journey of self-identity."
detrans,fixhu6q,t1_fiwwhda,1582820649.0,"I can weather these storms alone, but it would be easier with outside support. Life is difficult and I'm trying to learn to cope and manage as responsibilities increase. That's the average teen experience. I'm also currently in therapy to manage my depression, which has been a separate but difficult challenge. 

I've looked at some of the costs and my biggest concerns are the social isolation from family. Personally I believe it is worth it, but I don't want to the guilt because of their time and money spent on me. But I should continue to look into medical risk, which I have limited knowledge of. Right now, I am willing to take most risk, provided that they aren't life threating."
detrans,fixgc03,t1_fiwei7h,1582819883.0,Thank you. That's a better way of thinking about it. I've been very binary between being trans and not when it's really a decision to transition based on these feelings.
detrans,fixfwxf,t1_fiwhrdy,1582819649.0,"When I see myself as a man in my 30s, I imagine filling the role of husband, father, or uncle. It's less about power and more about I have an easier time seeing myself aging as a man.

I would rather be an old man. I don't feel strongly because I have such a hard time conceptualizing it, but I can imagine a lot better than being elderly as a man. 

I have been challenging female socialization since I was young, especially as I overcome my shyness. It helps to not force myself into an expected female box. But I could definitely do more. 

I guess I treat it as a decision that happens to me because I don't want to be responsible for the social fallout from transitioning. I'm trying to be more proactive instead of passive now."
detrans,fiw6rbs,t1_fivppzb,1582776584.0,"I feel binary. I feel pretty strongly toward male. The only issue is the possibility of losing friends and family or damaging my future. It's healthy to have doubt about such a big part of identity. 

I'm not sure about what I prefer when elderly. I can't imagine myself being old, I don't interact often with older people. I could vaguely see myself being in my mid 30s as a man, but not as a woman. 

A very interesting perceptive."
detrans,fiw5zd2,t1_fivpm48,1582776024.0,"There are also subs that support and encourage transitioning. Those subs are full of transmen that are happy with their transition.

detrans,fiw5oc9,t1_fivqn6c,1582775804.0,"Right now, I've been making small steps by coming out to some of my friends. It's helped because I don't have to deal with pronouns I feel uncomfortable with as much. 

I am considering social transition, hormones, and top surgery. I accept that I will never be 100% male. That is just impossible with current science. I'm sure I can reach a threat where I feel content. I would like to get close without the threat of serious complications, like with phalloplasty. If I decide to transition, it makes sense to use the medical resources available to change what exercise can't.  

I've kept myself partially content by dressing as male for a number of years, without directly telling anyone or suggesting I have these thoughts. I plan on attempting to live as male when away from family and high school, so I have a better idea of if this should be my future.

I have been worried about this idea of chasing. I can't take many steps right now, so I've been doing a lot of inward reflection. I like myself in areas that don't involve gender. I'm developing a personality and style that I can be proud of. I don't have to wait to ""become"" a man, I can become someone I'm proud regardless of gender. Thanks for the reminder, it's easy to get lost in the chasing element in trans culture."
detrans,fiw3lbj,t1_fivwalu,1582774344.0,"If I got everything I wanted, I wouldn't be happy. I need goals and structure. I want to skip school every day but I suck it up. The urge to self-destruct is very present and very counterproductive. 

I've been really trying to consider *why* of transition lately. I look at every reason and if one of them seems to be caused by internalized misogyny, I challenge it completely. Still, I find that I want to live a male even in spaces that were more LGBT friendly and encourage self-expression. I just enjoy looking like a man and being referred to as such. 

I know transitioning will not fix my life, especially not the depression and anxiety which has other causes. If I decide to transition, I would be able to fulfill my desire to live as a man and that would positively impact my life. If I chose not to transition, I would have worked through my issues and become more confident. It's a win-win if I approach the situation carefully, which I plan to do.

I do have a bias that could be the result of internalized misogyny (ex. preferring the male friends) and I've been working at that. I challenge a lot of my thoughts so the irrational ones hold less weight until I completely don't believe them, but I wish the process was faster or I had some guidance.

None of my female friends desire to be male in the same way I do. Either it is a small urge borne out of discomfort with harsh expectations of womanhood from family and being sexualized at an early age. Or they don't think about it, despite experiencing worse conditions (street harassment, classmates being sexual).

Self-destructing feels good in the moment, but you'll likely regret it. Here are some other options. I don't know what you like, but go out and buy yourself something nice, preferable under $100. Or exercise? Not a simple 30 minute jog, work out all your anger and frustration. Get in the car, drive somewhere, pull over and scream? Go out and watch a movie, buy all the snacks?

Why do you want to self-destruct in the first place? I usually want to escape pain or boredom."

You're welcome. I'm sorry you have to wait. Try to keep up with your friends more. I understand the urge to isolate, but it's terrible for you. Sometimes, just someone being in the room or talking to me can make me feel less horrible. Venting helps me too,"

Could you ask someone around you to help you set up an appointment? Or go to your doctor and have them recommend someone? I'm glad you want to get help, you seem very self-aware. I know it's hard to feel angry and useless when you want to stop suffering, you should lean on others for a bit. I'm confident you'll recover."

I set my alarms early as fuck and plan for the 30-60 minutes it takes me to get out of bed. If I feel stuck in my bed, I wiggle my fingers and toes to remind myself I can move. Then I move my arms and legs, until I slowly get out of the bed. I have a schedule for bedtimes, eating, hygiene, etc, that I try not to slack on. That works for me, maybe not you."

Anxiety,f7d8f0s,t3_dvi0te,1573610264.0,"I find that breathing helps with my stomach. I do it really slow, 4-5-8. It doesn't make it go away completely but it helps after a while. Sometimes I have continually calm myself down because my stomach retightens, it's annoying but I manage.

It's hard though, recently I've been just suffering through it. I can't stop the thoughts, but I really try to fight or ignore them. I remind myself that these thoughts are always wrong. I switch to another topic that I'm anxious about but to a lesser degree so I have less stress overall or something I'm passionate or excited about. I watch a lot of tv to distract myself, it keeps me fully engaged. I talk to my friends, conversations take a lot of attention."
Anxiety,f7d7co8,t3_dvk9vn,1573609487.0,"I have been struggling recently, but I rely heavily on deep breathing and distractions. The breathing reduces the intensity of physical symptoms, even if only by a little. If my mind is racing, I will try and channel all my attention into something else. Like, I listen intently to a youtube video or start a conversation.

My counselor told me to first resist anxiety-fueled behaviors, like checking the rooms in my house for intruders. Also, gain exposure to fears and power through the discomfort, which is so hard. You need to strike a balance, like it needs to be a challenge but don't push yourself toward a panic attack. Baby steps and it's okay to not be perfect with progress."
Anxiety,f7d614i,t3_dvd1ao,1573608526.0,"Definitely. I'm afraid of voice chat and the team hating me because I'm so shit. I don't play COD to create more stress, Jesus. I'm sticking to story mode until my anxiety calms down.

Not even just online games, I've had to turn off my action-adventure games too. Like in RDR2, the fear of being approached by strangers in the game was overwhelming. I'm able to manage more now but I play very safe, I don't push myself too much."
