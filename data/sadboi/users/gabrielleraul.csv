It's kinda extreme for me, like i can't even look at meat in any form. I'll start imagining where it came from and how the animal must have just been living it's life, or how much it would have suffered to get to someone's plate. I sound like a lunatic here, but what to do, that's the way it is. I was determined to never to watch a animal centric movie ever, but then I was asked to watch Okja... Such a brilliant brilliant movie. It would make anyone who is not even slightly sensitive to animal cruelty a bit more aware. And... Thank you for going vegan... üíö"
