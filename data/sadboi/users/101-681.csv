mentalhealth,fdt3svb,t1_fdsd5nr,1578711548.0,"still don't understand why i couldn't think of listening to some music, i just woke up and still feel bad, will definitely try this for now"
mentalhealth,fdt3kj9,t1_fdscb7g,1578711461.0,"i'll definitely look more into progressive relaxation, even though i don't feel it at the moment, i think i tend to tense up whenever i have strong urges to commit suicide because afterwards my body aches.

also, all of these distraction methods are great. they make so much sense now that i've slept and woke up. but at the time i couldn't even think of trying to listen to music

thanks,"
mentalhealth,fdrs3ah,t1_fdrrqty,1578688909.0,"yeah i created a throwaway account and searched ""suicidal""  this sub's the first one that comes up"
mentalhealth,fdrrez8,t1_fdrr6zx,1578688584.0,thanks. i only really want to interact with people and/or open up when i'm having a hypomanic episode really. groups never work for me anyway but thanks
mentalhealth,fdrpzht,t1_fdrpl9w,1578687996.0,i keep a diary daily. i wrote on it an hour ago and got all teary half way through and stuff. yes writing feels good. but i don't want to leave the bed. thanks for the advice though.

mentalhealth,fdrnca9,t1_fdrmhn5,1578686902.0,"i've stayed at the hospital for a month and went to session + took the pills for another 2 months, the pills just made me feel very dull and i felt slow and i'd feel sleepy and tired all the time but when i actually tried to sleep i'd have to take another pill which made me feel even more tired in the morning. i have my own responsibilities i couldn't function.

sessions didn't seem to help either. 

thanks for asking feels good to write it down"
