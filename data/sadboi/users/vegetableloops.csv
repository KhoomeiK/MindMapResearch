VirginiaTech,fjwvpsu,t3_ff4ll8,1583647118.0,I’m president of the FIRST Alumni Association!
VirginiaTech,fjsu63e,t1_fjsre9p,1583600498.0,"I would, but also some people get multiple offers and so if you end up not going, they might have a backup. I’d use your best judgment!"
VirginiaTech,fjsqzvr,t3_fexibg,1583599750.0,"In a lot of Facebook pages (I.e Virginia Tech Class of 2022), people are asking around for people to live with them or to take over their leases. Plenty of vacancies from what I’ve seen."
Huntingtons,eutgrlx,t1_euqfrfh,1564025501.0,"I’m sorry to hear about your mom, but I’m glad to hear you were able to bounce back and remain hopeful and grateful. You’re absolutely right; life isn’t going to wait around. Hearing from someone who is around my age brings a lot of comfort. Thank you so much."
Huntingtons,eutghoh,t1_euqcniq,1564025378.0,"This is very nice to hear. That could save so many people. I never really knew my grandpa because of HD, and so even though I didn’t get to know him, I hope that others can benefit from this so that they can get to know their grandpa. Thank you so much."
Huntingtons,eutgbcn,t1_euq9f1j,1564025298.0,"This is a very good outlook on it. You’ve helped me realize that I shouldn’t just sit around and wait, positive or not. Thank you so much; best wishes to you!"
Huntingtons,eutg6e9,t1_eunfxg8,1564025236.0,"I think I feel selfish because she has told me not to worry for her, but I am, and I feel like I’m wasting time worrying (which I have been a little bit). I have been trying to educate those who are closest to me so that they can potentially help educate others in the future. Thank you for the kind words!"
Huntingtons,eutfzls,t1_eunbaxq,1564025152.0,Thank you so much.
mentalillness,euneldw,t1_eu4sx1j,1563927794.0,"Most of the what is described here are all symptoms of HD, so I don’t think that BPD is something that should be automatically assumed."
drumcorps,etxwpvo,t1_ettkc4i,1563309045.0,"I AGREE. They were fantastic; their hornline understands dynamic contrast so well, their guard performed very well, and the GE was top notch. I feel like they were underscored. Sure, not first place, but I don’t think their score matched their performance."
CitiesSkylines,ervmkml,t3_c4akyz,1561319675.0,How many people do you have living in there? Super cool!
