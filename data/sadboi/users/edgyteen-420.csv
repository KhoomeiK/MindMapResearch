IHateMyself,f9x3m34,t3_e77870,1575704041.0,"If you want to lose the weight you must do it 100% for yourself. Trust me I‚Äôve made the mistake of using bullies for motivation before and it doesn‚Äôt work. As far as the bullying goes, the best thing to say in response is something along the lines of ‚Äúwhy do you feel the need to say that?‚Äù Or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs your problem mate‚Äù. This way you call them out making them vulnerable and take away their power. If you are nonchalant they will realise you are not bothered by it and feel shit about being a dickhead.
