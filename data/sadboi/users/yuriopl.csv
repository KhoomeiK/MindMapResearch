If not, then it might be slightly harder to get in (or so I hear), but certainly not impossible! I had a friend not in the top 6% (the threshold for auto admit), but she got in because of her SAT score (1450). So maybe try aiming around there. 

Also make sure your essays are good, you have good ECs etc.

Also it depends on what major you’re shooting for. Like I’m applying to English (don’t roast me LMAO) and that’s not as competitive as say, engineering or business.

And also maybe try demonstrating interest, maybe scheduling a visit to the campus?

Good luck, I hope to see you there!"
