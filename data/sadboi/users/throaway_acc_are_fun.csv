In a perfect world you would assume they are all 18+ but no one can confirm, and what you will try back track it to find. Who is? In most actually ilegal cases they protect themselfs to not get caught (i am talking about who organizes here not the teen) , soeven if u do confirm they are 18 u probably will only take the vid down... Maybe stop the teen from doing anymore, but lots of times they wouldnt anyways...

TrueOffMyChest,fln1t2p,t3_fpra1h,1585305933.0,"But there is a problem with all of this...

Imagine the if there was an complete crash on economy (what wont happen in this scale but is a example) and we needed to resort to narcisism or/and tribalism because the govern would crash eithout yhe economy, in this case way more people would die, like u dont know how tonlive without the services that u have today, a world with no super markets, fabrics services etc, ppl wouldnt be able to survive and we would be talking in death numbers hundreds if times worse than c9rona and a big setback in humanity evolution...

Going to a more real idea, if the economy crashed but not completly, this would mean the poor people would be even more screwed, like this rly wouldnt affect bilionares in a big way (unless their market/area got directly hit) because doesnt matter if they get lose 20% of the worth of their money if society also does, but will affect the  poor ppl, i am talking about thousands if not milions of deaths to hunger or associated deseases, also the geral standart of living would drasticly drop, and the average age of living (idk the technical term) would also drop bc medical services would be way more unaccessible...

So no, a economic crash wont only affect the bilionares, in fact will affect the poor/average people way worse... For example if only the us market crashed, the rich would just seap currencies to euro ot some shit, like the equador milionares and bilionares did..."

No never went tk the usa but i am actually going there when i leave home, specially considering i am studing for it, and the average sallary here is like 800, what i know irs ridiculous compared with usa, and b4 ppl tell me that prices are also higher, yes food and other stuff here is way lower than there , but half of the stuff that id bought nowadays as a ""internacional"" price like techonology. Specially consider u game, you rememeber i siad in here the average sallary is way lower than there, i think it was 4x times when i searched, bc we still fcking pay 60/80 bucks for a game, and 400 for a console... the minimum month wage is 600 here, os basicly a console and 2 games, and you dont have more food for the month,and all that if ofc you forget the taxes... and eith them you will probably end uo with only the console with luck xd... but like i said here everyone gets a chance so you can still go to a homless shelter lol...
