They part where I was talking about teaching and you got confused was - My group starts studying way before me like one chick start 2 months prior exams, when exams are a week due I tell all my friends to explain me one chapter each, then in return I teach the whole syllabus. Like 8 friends 8 chapters each takes one, I go home spend some time alone clearing my doubts and then teach them, this way I revise also there doubts make my head even clearer about the topic. However later after exams I am barely able to keep stuff in mind so I need to relearn the stuff again these aren't Fundaments they are newer concept which change every sem with same format. 

I must thank you for writing and helping me out with your thoughts, I'm surely gonna keep them in my mind and try to implement them in real life and keep noting my triggers."

The only way you can do better according to me is by living through sadness and making up your mind to do something cause its been long time you are like this, write it down if you can, listen to motivating music and try to focus on lyrics. Once you are done writing it down just look at as someone else problem and try solving it. Stop feeling that was is the worst ways to do this so acknowledge the sadness and look out for factors or triggers that make you feel that way and then focus on taking those factors down, you'll have to realise the factor and note them while you catch them.

After opening up it feels naked but later what follows is the regret of someone seeing them that way and that's why they don't really share anything much to anyone, also it's pretty normal among people which such issues. They'd often let the people who helped let go by insulting or confronting, this is not because they don't like you or something it's just that they feel they are liability on you. They are insecure to ask help and being dependant cause they weren't so prior meeting that person. The best thing too do is hold on cause this will pass by and they forgive themselves soon and start believing in themselves, the key is to keep them talking but also when they are telling you their secrets not dig deeper much cause when anxiety shoots up they will feel the sense of liability and hopelessness again"

I started that way, watch Ted talks or something that's interests you like space and deep sea exploration on YouTube.

The best way out for me was to actually focus in myself and enjoy my company, being in love with yourself can help. Start by doing small self care routines like drinking water at night and be consistent. I saw this one Ted talk when the speaker suggested that if you say good morning  I love *your name* while keeping your hand over your heart you'll feel good, it takes like a week.

I myself am going through various thoughts and too getting over attachments. It's been a month I've been off instagram and a almost 3 weeks off whatsapp. First few days are difficult and they best way to cope up is listening to music and doing little things that you didn't do. For instance now I bath thrice and have made my self care routine. Read about something abstract so that your brain thinks of other things besides the problem you are going through. Being an ENFJ we often day dream cause we have lots and lots of thoughts flowing through our head. Well now since you are now reading about something now you'll have doubts and you can dig deeper and learn a lot from that. Additionally this at times you dig deeper into yourself and try not to talk to people and instead write down all the thoughts that are popping your head and later try to logically come up with a solution. Exercise and maintain yourself, remember it's gonna be you and yourself who is always gonna be there with you. I hope I was of some use to you."
