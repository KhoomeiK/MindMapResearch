Edit: if this does happen to be the case, I would recommend these couple of things to stay balanced: 

•figure out the warning sights- this was a game changer for me, figure out which specific warning signs you have to look for to avoid becoming unmotivated and depressed. For me it always looks like this : I’ll stop eating, then I will begin neglecting my hygiene, begin isolating myself from others, then crying spells. Now that I know that I do these things before I get seriously depressed, as soon as I noticed I’ve stopped eating I can focus on getting food into my body before it can take a hold on my mood if that makes sense.

•have a routine- a strict routine and stick to it, have a time window of when you’d like to be up and showered, when you want to eat your meals, go to sleep, bathe, exercise etc.

•writing- lists, journaling, plans, goals, feelings.

•meals- eat enough everyday, and eat the right foods. Don’t skip meals by any means.

•sleep- be responsible about sleep, go to bed in the same window of time and wake up at the same time."

He’s the kindest most genuine person, treats me right with respect and kindness, has so many similar interests, values and morals with me that it’s actually sort of bizarre. But I always kept him at a distance because I didn’t want to subject him to the awful person I believed I was, I always thought he deserved someone better. The entire time I’ve known him he’s remained single while I have had two terribly abusive relationships.

But now after years of therapy and work to change my view of myself him and I have began dating and wow.. how clearly I can see that him and I should have been together a long time ago. 

I’m not sure what your brothers situation is but this could be the case perhaps, and if so try to help him to see that he is worthy of her love and affection."

Things that you may not even realize are such terrible obstacles like cooking or remembering to eat enough. Going to the store to purchase the food to cook. Going to work to earn money to purchase that food. taking all of your medication properly, having to go to the pharmacy to get the medication. Staying connected to people instead of avoiding them so you don’t feel isolated. 

I’m in hospital right now because of a depressive episode. I’ve been in the same room/same chair for over 30 hours, aside from using the washroom (waiting for a free bed). It’s shitty. But I know if I were at my apartment right now I would be using drugs, I wouldn’t be taking my meds, likely zero food consumed at all, and certainly no social interaction for as long as I can avoid it. I would be hiding from all of my problems and ignoring my body. I cant do that here. I can have my meds evaluated and changed in less than a week, a process that would likely take months if I weren’t here.
