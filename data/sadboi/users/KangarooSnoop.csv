NintendoSwitch,fr3kc0b,t1_fqym3ae,1589859287.0,"Sounds like you didn't explore enough. When that's like 95% of the game. They use map to it's fullest potential. It's definitley not barren. Shrines, towns, classic zelda landmarks, koroks, enemy encampments (don't underestimate these. finding every single one is fun), secret chests, puzzles for shrines, character quests for shrines, boss battles (lynels, hinox, talus, malduga.) 
If they had half as many caves as they do shrines, this game would probably have my favorite map of any game ever. It might already be my favorite map, but it would leave me with zero complaints in that regard.

My guess is you just haven't looked around enough. Literally. I'm not trying to be a douchebag or an elitist. What I mean is most games (really every game tbh) uses the majority of the map as background, or decoration. But to get the most out of this game, you genuinely have to look at every mountain, surface, plateau, cliff, every piece of land, and think if you've been there before. Or just go ahead and explore everywhere you can physically get to. It all just depends on how you personally explore. But it is important to put some thought into it, as being curious will most often reward you, and you will (WILL, not might) find something in that spot you've never been to before. Even if it's a small ledge, or an open field. There's always something there. It might not be the coolest thing, but getting anything just for being curious is a nice dopamine rush.

After my first playthrough, tbh, I felt the similar. A slight disappointment in how it wasn't enough like the other zeldas, and I kinda just felt like ""that's it?"" Then on my second and third playthrough, the areas I found were completely new to me. It was as if they updated the game, that's how blind I was to them existing before. You'll be suprised, no matter how observant you are, this game doesn't tell you anything beyond the primary grade knowledge you need just to function properly. The whole game is basically hidden behind how capable you are at discovering it. RDR2 took a few notes by keeping a lot of mechanics and interactions off the trail, but BOTW makes RDR2 look like they're holding your hand the whol way lol you'll find new places, and even new mechanics on every playthrough of this game. 

Unfortunately, as much as I love exploring, it has it's drawbacks by being so dependent on that. Main one being replay value. Ironically the replay value is very strong for most players, in the first few replays, but longterm replay value is almost zero. Oncr you've discovered every encampment and found most korok seeds, the thrill of adventuring is limited to... ""hey, that's an angle of that side of that cliff I haven't seen yet.""

That all said, I recommend fighting ganon twice. First time whenever you think you're ready. Even if you're in a rush, go for it. No reason to delay it, just get it out of the way. See how it ends. Sate all your curiosities about the end game. I recommend doing this sooner rather than later. 

Then the second time, I would push off for as long as possible. If you're a completionist or a grinder, this is the time to get all that out of your way. If you weren't in any hurry to beat ganon in the first place, then just do all this before you fight him. If you're anything like me, the exploring does become a little less... punctual if you've already defeated ganon. Unless you leave yourself a lot. But otherwise, this second time should be the last. Put it off as long as possible, do it when you truly feel like you've completed the game and you're ready to wrap things up. 

That's all I feel like I can say atm about selling the game. There's a lot more I could say to express how much I love the game, but it's best you discover that all on your own. It feeds into the reward system designed around exploring. It's all about the thrill of the adventure. Never run from a fight, don't be afraid of getting side tracked on your way to a waypoint or objective, and be observant as well as curious. 

I guarantee if you go into this game with more of a laxed and low-stakes, fun-forward, ""maybe I'll try this thing and see what happens, why not"", experimental, open perspective for the next playthrough, you'll have fun. It's not super ""zelda-ey"" (maybe the sequel will be tho) but it is fun in it's own way. And it's incredible in many ways if you just take the time to appreciate the little details."

papertowns,fqghboz,t1_fplcv42,1589346277.0,"This is the entire reason why I love the ac games and have played them since I was a kid. Each game inteoduces a new culture, in a different country, with vastly different geography and architecture, and wildlife. I just find them fascinating for that reason, as far as gameplay and story, they aren't very good... ubisoft is very lazy and reuses as many assests as they can get away with from game to game. The gameplay loop is soulcrushing in some entries in particular.

My favorite is probably ac3. It takes place in colonial america, late 1700s. The clothes and cities are so cool and very of their time. You get to run around a very young boston and new york city  through basically every season, I personally think winter looks the best for this setting. If you're into those cities and the time, there's some really sweet concept art of that game. Lots of dirt roads, brick buildings and busy ports. They translate into the game pretty well too. The sound design is also really on point in this game. When you're walking through snow, when the wood floor in a general shop creaks when you move around on it, the sound of the sea birds and church bells. It really immerses you.

I also just happen to love the look of the ports and ships from the 1700s. It all just reminds me of my grandmas house when I was a kid. Oh and there's a large section of the wilderness you can hunt and search for treasure in, and on the coast there's a homestead you can invite other settlers to live at, and over time you grow a small village from the ground up. All with side characters you know and (have the option to) frequently do side missions with. You can also send convoys to get supplies and make some money. Also once you get a tailor and a blacksmith and level them up (by helping them in missions) they can make you some pretty cool stuff. And the protagonist has been criticized for being... well boring, and I do agree with that, but I find the fact that he's a native american really cool. You can mix parkour with climbing trees, and wield a tomahawk and wooden bow. It's just cool playing as an early native American to me, one of the cultures and people I find the most interesting.

This might be the only positive comment you ever read about ac3 lol most people hate it. But I recommend it if any of this appeals to you. I personally play these games for the world more than any of the other elements."

freefolk,fqayms6,t1_fqaezlr,1589227533.0,"Stephen kings works are way more basic compared to george's complex stories. On average. There's exceptions to this on both sides. Also remember that he writes them in a specific style of speaking to match not only the setting, but certain regions in the books.

Additionally, considering the amount of perspectives in each book, you're basically getting that many stories but in one book. So some books have over 10 books within them. He also writes every event that happens in such a way that every single thing means something, or atleast aludes to it. Or will mean something in the future. That's not easy, and is probably the main reason why it's taking him so long. He's a bit symbolic/ allegory  heavy.

Stephen king takes a very simple idea and elaborates on it to form a story around one thing or another. I'm not saying they're bad obviously lol I'd be crazy to think that, I love his work too. I'm just saying they're different kinds authors and write drastically different kinds of books.

George also has some anthologies and short stories that don't have as much depth as ASOIAF, he's probably quicker with those, idk. But as far as ASOIAF goes, I don't think King has a series that long. He does mostly one and dones, and a lot of them follow similar formulas or basic beats. He does a lot with simple ideas though, that's where he shines. Stephen takes simple ideas and builds on them. George takes big and complex ideas and dissects them. That calls for very different styles of writing."

teenagers,fq5bt1v,t1_fq5a7u7,1589099430.0,"That's rough... idk if this helps, but I don't think ""the right one"" exists. I think we go through life meeting many people, and sometimes, if we open ourselves up to it, we connect to people on a deep level. Some people just happen to pulls strings in us that we have no control over, and if that happens both ways, then we're under the spell of eachother, and it feels magical.

So I believe there's many ""the right one""'s, but that also means we may have walked right past people on the street who we might be perfect matches with, but never realizing it because of the random and chaotic nature of life. The way I see it, with the vast amount of people there are in this world, we'll probably never end up with the person who we're the most perfect for. And with the nature of time, that skews it even more. Maybe my most compatible soul mate was alive 500 years ago, or 500 years from now. Maybe she would've been in a college class I'm taking next year, but she was hit by a few months ago. We'll never know.

Things like right place, right time, optimal mindset, the type of phase you're currently going through in life at any time, these are all things that are constantly changing and thus opening and closing windows around us, simultaneously, as we just go through our day to day. All this stuff is happening and we can't see it. But if you just try to pay a little more attention, you might be able to jump through one of those windows in time.

What you had, may very well have been magical. But I guarantee if you keep your heart open, and let the hopeless romantic in you be vulnerable, you'll find another some day. Not saying it will be the same, but it could be even better. Life is weird sometimes. You might just find a girl who was in a very similar situation to you, who also has one that got away. But the only way you'd find that out is by talking to her... so never let an opportunity fly by you. Get ya self out there and open yourself to the heartache. Because however bad it feels, when you find the next girl, it will swing in the complete opposite direction and you'll be soaring. That's a roller coaster ride well worth taking"

The fear of rejection is something that will genuinely ruin your life. For real. It's better to get turned down occasionally, even all the time, if it means getting though here and there. Because the alternate is getting nothing. Sure you have a perfect score, but you're also 20 and single and lonely and stuck in quarantine for what looks like a year with no sign of things looking up. 

Just shoot your shot. Lose gracefully, with style, and on your feet. There's honor in losing. If you're funny, you can even roll with the punches and it'll only make you stronger and more attractive to friends and alumni alike. But only if you're real about it, to yourself and others.

It's someone to talk to before and after, and are in agreement with about it. If you trapped a robot that's screaming and begging to be let go, somethings a little fucked up about fucking it then going on with your life. Whether it was ""real"" or not. 

This show constantly deals with what it means to be regarded as ""real"" on a technical level. If it exists (in a physcial form, a body), and it's talking to you (whether it's programmed for improvisation or not. You could consider our life experiences and past conversations the same as programming for improvisation in humans) then why isn't it real? Because we created it, it somehow belongs to us now? Imagine if all our parents felt the same way lol. 

Maybe a soul and conciousness doesn't need a beating heart to exist. Idk. I'm getting off track. What I'm saying is, it's not about them. It's about you. Let's say they gave you permission to do whatever you want to them. So hurting them isn't wrong because it ""hurts"" them, because they wanted it. But it's my opinion that's it's still wrong because YOU want to. That's what I mean when I say it isn't about them, it's about you. Why would you want to do something terrible if it's just pretend? 

In videogames, there's usually incentives to act bad. Money, XP, entertaining physics or dialogue, a different branch of the story, and sometimes different abilities that make playing the game interesting. But games like RDR2, where they don't really offer anything for being evil, the only consequences are people just look at you different. I noticed it just wasn't fun anymore, and the game actually makes me feel a bit guilty because of how grounded the reactions from other people towards you doing the wrong thing are. It's pretty interesting how different it is when you're just doing a bad thing just to do a bad thing. I think if you take your own body, and throw yourself into that game (meaining go to a theme park yourself, westworld) the consequences become even more ""real"", or should I say punctuated. I think jumping into a simulation for 8 hours, where you torture and rape, just for fun, then stepping out, even though no one was actually hurt, is weird, gross, wrong, and says a lot about the person. I stand by that. 

Is it technically wrong? Guess not, unless we get philosophical. If you asked the creators of the show, they might say it is. They seem to have a lot of ideas about consciousness.

Is it morally wrong? I'd say yes. No hero, or good guy is looking for an opportunity to do ugly things in a circumstance with no real world consequences. At that point, it's barely even ""fake."" Whatever that word even means in this context anymore."

westworld,fpmmeo7,t1_fpm63o9,1588736316.0,"Doubt it. His role is actually very important. They just went about it... not the best way. But for dolores to win, she'd need a lot of help. The world is full of highly advanced weapons. Not even 100 hosts is enough to take it over. She needed humans to turn on humans, and that means she needed to turn one against the others, and start a rebellion. Humans aren't going to just follow a robot leader into the abyss. But if she could fool just one, and groom them into a leader, then everyone would think they were following one of their own, who they can relate to, and trust. 

That's basically what this whole season was, but with far less malice from Dolores than I expected. Turns out she isn't so crazy. 

I think people are way off here. Caleb isn't the leader. He never was. He was the puppet, Dolores was pulling the strings. She picked him because he was an outlier, they say this directly. He wanted agency more than he wanted a monotonous but safe life. So he was the perfect candidate to attract others like him, and ""lead"" them, with Dolores taking on the true leadership role from behind the curtains. That's atleast how I was expecting this to happen. But as it turns out, she wants him to decide for himself, how he's going to lead. This whole season might just act as a prequel to his leadership. He's not there yet because Dolores isn't done with her plans yet. Until now. So by next season, he probably will be the leader she was setting him up to be.

Idk why people were expecting to see him leading this season, so soon. Like what would the proper examples be? He's thrown into this so quickly, and there are so many different plans he just walked in the middle of. He's not gonna pick up a staff and immediately run the show.

Now he gets to go on rampages with a lot less at stake. Remember, nothing is sacred to him anymore. He killed his own daughter, he could give a fuck about himself. As evidenced by the other 3 versions of himself he killed earlier this season. Plus when it comes down to it, he didn't ask to be born, but now he exists in a world with two of himself's, and he knows the ""real"" William is actively trying to kill all hosts, which means him as well.

At first I was a bit let down by the series shuffle, but now I'm convinced house of the dragon is the better option, and maybe even the best option for right now. If they're eventually go make another atark and white walker show, it should be sandwiched between other series less similar to it. 

And the best course of action for when to bring in white walkers, is to wait until WoW or even DoS is out, just so we know if there's a bigger picture with them, and if it needs to be foreshadowed towards early on. For how dense the books are, it's hard to tell how many details and remarks are foreshadowing, or world building, or anecdotal, or allegorical, or metaphorical. There's a lot there is what I'm saying, so they can never implement everything from the books, because they can never truly tell what's ""important"", because for all we know, everything is important to something in the story. So guessing where they're headed isn't a safe bet, that's why I think they should wait a while before even considering making something with the white walkers again."
Marvel,fp4n1gz,t1_fnbr17j,1588302644.0,"Yeah I never enjoy watching movies like that. It's too much of bumpy road. Too many abrupt changes in quality. 

The fact that captain marvel has so damn many references to the entirety of the mcu would make watching it second just weird. 

Characters that have almost no explanation because we've already seen them before, but their debut was not their earliest appearance in the timeline, like nick fury and ronan. 

It just seems like a way less consistent and overall unenjoyable way to watch the series. I always just go with the release dates"
ImaginaryWesteros,fp3o9w5,t1_foz4ixo,1588282832.0,"Idk why they'd shelf one just to move onto another. Maybe it was really bad. Or they just realized people weren't ready, and jumped the gun by setting plans in action before the final season. If they ever went back to it I'm curious what the cast would look like. I'm not necessarily a fan of naomi watts, I don't think she really stands out in an interesting-to-watch, interesting-to-listen-to kinda way.

It's just cool to look at houses you'd never actually be able to or even want to buy. So Netflixdoes the thing where they recommend slightly more specific types of movies or shows. So I get recommended a ""home improvement"" section, and I scroll through it... and at the end of it, there's a stand up special from Tim Allen. 

Not quite a joke in and of itself, but it's deifnitley a low key reference to Home Improvement lol just a little more clever. I don't know if that has to do with similar key words or something, or if there's an employee working at netlfix with jokes, but I thought it was funny.

Breath_of_the_Wild,foph80h,t1_fonwofy,1587961420.0,"Yeah, but we all know they aren't connected at the end of the day. It's clear nintendo has never intentionally made the effort to bridge them, beyond legitimizing a fans timeline by putting it in one of the books, which I took as just a fun way to stoke the fire of fans discussing the series. I think it was all in good fun. They definitely didn't plan out the timeline when the chronological order of the timeline is all scattered in relation to the order the games came out.

It's fun to find ways to connect them, but if nintendo actually took in account a valid timeline, it would kill the creativity that makes each zelda unique and different from the next. The series is at it's best when it tries something new, without worrying about how it carefully ties into everything else they've established over 30 years"
Breath_of_the_Wild,fopgztv,t1_fop1w5f,1587961251.0,"I recently restarted mario odyssey, and having played it with my full attention and curiousity set to the max (like would with zelda game), I've come to realize how similar it is to BOTW. As is tradition for both game franchises, they'll take you across many worlds/ lands with varying level deisgns. Hot places, cold places, woodsy places, beaches, volcanoes, all that good stuff. 

And something that made this playthrough 10x more fun for me, is playing the game as I would a zelda game. If you do that, you'll come to realize there's secrets around every corner. If you see something far away, or if you look up at something tall, or if you take in account to search every side and every angle of a platform, you'll find a lot of secret moons, coins, or region exclusive coins, as opposed to korok seeds and dope as armor and weapons. Odyssey, unlike Zelda which has one massive open world, has about 10 worlds, 5 of which maybe are like entire little open worlds with a lot of different areas you can get to, some only after beating the main story. So if you search high and low, wall to wall, it'll remind you a lot of zelda.

Other than that, I'm in the same boat as you man... I've been looking for other games similar to Zelda my entire life. We're just lucky that Miyamoto, the source of all childhood joy, has made more than one game series. I'll take any suggestions for other games like zelda if anyone has them, but I'm doubtful we'll ever find them.

That said playstation has amazing exclusives, if you haven't gone down that road. Spiderman, God of War, Uncharted, The last of us. Then there's TW3 and RDR2 available on all consoles, but I recommend playstation as the console to play the game on."
Breath_of_the_Wild,fopfc8o,t1_foo8993,1587960045.0,"That's because the series is an anthology (minus a few sequels here and there.) It's actually one of my favorite aspects of the franchise, because everything is different with every new game, but things like characters and locations reappear, but in slightly or even drastically different ways. The best part is maybe how the art style is different in every game, which creates completely different tones, and even varying levels of realism from game to game. 

For example twilight princess is like a super dark medieval fantasy game visually and aesthetically, and then you have a game like wind waker, which is a tropical island adventure game with a lot of sailing and an overall cute art stlye. Skyward sword just looks like a beautiful painting came to life, with a little bit of every asian culture mixed in and a little bit of a Dr. Suess twist. Breath of the wild might actually have my least favorite art style. I love the look of the enemies, the landscapes, and the structures, but I'm not a fan of the anime character models lol it's just not my thing. 

With BOTW2 presumably being a darker game, it makes me curious what direction the next game will take. Before we knew BOTW was getitng a sequel, I think many of us assumed a more detailed, darker, surrealistic look come around again, especially after the Wii U graphics demo showcased a really cool peak into what that could look like. But if BOTW2 gets really dark, they might move towards a more cartoony, light aesthetic for the next gen. Or a surrealistic look but a lighter tone. Idk, I guess anythings possible. Now seems like a good time to stop rambling lol"

It would definitely be last in line, and they wouldn't even dream about beginning work on it atleast until WoW is out. But I could see them already counting it as a for sure thing they plan on doing eventually, which would be why they'd count it among the 5 spinoffs when teasing fans about what's in the works. 

Then again, they started the last show right around the release of the last book, and we still haven't gotten the next, so... maybe a reboot of the classic story is even further down the road than I give it credit for. Like 20 years or something... idk, doesn't matter as long as the world of ASOIAF is still building and thriving through different mediums and years and perspectives."

It's not fun, and it is definitely unhealthy, but it makes them look shredded af. It's crazy to think about but competitive bodybuilders just aren't healthy, regardless of how nice their bodies look. Any massive amount of weight on your body puts pressure on your heart. Your heart doesn't know the difference between muscle and fat, it just knows that it has to pump blood through 300 pounds of man, and keep a log of a body like that running when you're putting yourself under stress. Just look at any bodybuilders from the 70s today, like Arnie. Even from the last decade, Ronnie Coleman.

The average healthy person that goes to the gym, streches and hikes regularly is ironically more healthy than those guys, even if they don't look anywhere near as good."

teenagers,fo0rmn9,t1_fo05a3j,1587418483.0,"I've been working out in a gym since I was 13, and with all the data I've gathered since then, swimming seems to be the ultimate form of excercise. It's cardio, it's a bodyweight excercise, and yet it can work any muscle, and there's basically no way to hurt yourself or cause longterm damage or stress on your body. 

That's like everything you could need from excercise. Most people lift, sprint, and do yoga to check all the boxes. Yet swimming is all of those just by it's own.

And the best part, unlike most moves with a barbell, it can even be translated to practical use in real life. It also demands you to use your core, which with most forms of excercise you can kinda get around if you're lazy or clever enough. 

Oh and it's a therapeutic form of exercise too. I swim a lot whenever I'm going through an injury and it actually helps, because there really isn't any pressure to find it's way to your back when you're in a pool. When I had sciatica I could barely get up, muchless excercise. But swimming was not only the only thing I could do, (other than walk) it actually helped recovery a lot."

gameofthrones,fnblnxt,t3_g0f5fv,1586817744.0,"First of all, any sort of open world or linear narrative driven game in the song of ice and fire universe would be awesome. I'd take whatever we can get lol but mainly because I don't think it'll ever happen... if it were to, it would've been when game of thrones was at it's peak popularity. So I feel like it's never coming. But again, if it does, I'm 1000% down, no questions 

I agree with a lot of your ideas, but I can't get behind the combat. The witcher 3 is an amazing game for a million different reasons, but the combat mechanics are not one them. They're very clunky, and stiff, and just not too fun because of it. Odyssey's are similar but way too easy, and enemies are hit-spongy so fighting gets boring very quick.

I feel like the combat mechanics should be more like god of war or rhythmic like the batman arkham games. Or a mix of both. As you said, they should all have different styles. Batman Arkham knight is a good example of a game that has many playable characters, and they all have slightly different styles. Batman, robin, nightwing, catwoman, and harley just for reference. And they all feel different.

So I think characters like Ned, Tormund and The Hound should be more weighty and play a lot like Kratos in the God of war reboot. Jaime and Jon could play like a lot of protagonists in video games with vanilla sword mechanics. Oberyn could play a lot like catwoman, flexible, fast, and light on her feet. Arya could play like an assassin from any of the assassin creed games, considering she is one. It'd make sense for her to be stealthy. In an alternate universe, bran with all his climbing prowess would also be a perfect assassin lol

All said and done, it's fun to throw around ideas of what we want it to be, but honestly, I'd take anything we can lol I just hope they get a company like CDPR to make it. They know how to make an amazing and detailed fantasy world, they've already done it and succeded. So they understand a lot about how to make interesting fantasy design choices, including lore depth, side quest complexity, and rich storytelling that make game of thrones a perfect property for them to explore. I guess rockstar also checks a few of those boxes, but idk who else in the industry gets close. Maybe Bethesda? But they don't seem to on their best game these past few years.

It would be pretty risky, coming from anyone. But we can only hope that if it were to happen, that it'll be good. GRRM producing a game definitely looks promising tho! Maybe he'll give them the experience they need to eventually make a GoT game. I know they've done dark souls and bloodborne, but those are kind of the anti-GRRM way of storytelling. There's barely any dialogue, character motivations don't really exist, neither do character arcs, and... yeah, they're just completely different kinds of fantasy. But I still have a little hope that the universe will throw us all a GoT game sometime in the not so distant future."

It's really too bad they couldn't get their shit together. They have half of the coolest superheroes, they could've easily found their own lane and crushed it, but of course they had to try and play catch up to MCU. Better to do your own thing than be a worse version of something else.

Hopefully we get a young justice, or teen titans movie. The new batman looks very promising, but they'll probably be too timid to start a new franchise already.
