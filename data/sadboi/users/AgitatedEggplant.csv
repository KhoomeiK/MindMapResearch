Seriously, the mental clarity you get after a while is amazing. Like, I woke up one day and was like ""Wow, I don't feel like shit today! I don't have to feel like shit every morning?"" It was truly wild, and I hung onto that fresh feeling until I didn't even think about drinking anymore. 

I know not everyone has the same feelings/journey/relationship with alcohol, but whatever healthy method works for you,  dive in head first and don't look back. 

Best of luck! Please reach out if you're really struggling and/or want someone to talk to."

It also put into perspective how much drinking is integrated into modern lifestyle and relationships. Liquor stores are literally an 'essential business' right now in the US, and it blows my mind that they closed recreational marijuana sales, all smoke shops, but left the liquor stores open. The majority of the US seems so dependent on alcohol, and I'm glad I'm not part of that majority anymore."

I was lucky enough to quit cold turkey on my own. I honestly was in such a low point when I quit that I was scared to drink again for weeks. Feeling the mental clarity after those few weeks was such a blessing that I held onto the feeling and kept pushing on.

I have family members that swear on groups like AA and NA. I get it. Having in-person communication with people who totally understand your feelings can be such a good support system."

She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier."
