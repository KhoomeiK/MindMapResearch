1. Modis political acumen begins where the oppositions ends. Agree/Disagree ?

2. Sad that we have no opposition and that BJP will rule for a long time (bhakt way of thinking amirite?)

3. Called out the fact that making a speech just for Diya jalaao is stupid.

4. Where I disagree with you is the act of diya jalaao isn’t stupid. 

5. Modi has managed to create a wedge issue - proof critics are attacking the act itself instead of the PM. And imo most people won’t have a problem with the act. What they might have a problem with is that he isn’t doing anything more

You know what the first step is after identifying someone has Covid? Quarantine themselves for 14 days. If the symptoms increase and get worse then they consider hospitalisation.

Edit: 

> The model then uses the best current estimates of how long someone is infectious (14 days); how many new cases each infected person causes (called the effective reproduction number, it’s about 2.5); the percentage of Covid-19 patients who need to be hospitalized (5%, reflecting the fact that most people have only mild or moderate illness); the percentage who need to be in an ICU (2%) or on a ventilator (1%); and the length of stay for each of these three.

Required Reading: [Japan uses targeted coronavirus testing; South Korea goes big. The U.S. faces a choice.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-targets-coronavirus-testing-while-south-korea-goes-big-the-us-faces-which-path-to-take/2020/03/28/97e81b44-6eb6-11ea-a156-0048b62cdb51_story.html?hpid=hp_more-top-stories_virusjapantactics-145pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans&itid=hp_more-top-stories_virusjapantactics-145pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)

The gist of it is, 80% of the cases show mild to no symptoms. Any test on a person with mild symptoms uses up a mask and gown, and it risks infecting a health-care worker who might be more needed in an intensive-care unit.

Where Japan failed was implementing a curfew which we did. 


Sure, doing rampant testing will give us a more accurate picture. But it has a very high cost as well in terms of using our PPE & exposing our medical personnel. 

We have to come to grips with the fact that we are a very poor country and we need to focus our resources on those who need it the most. Doing rampant testing like South Korea & Germany works as they are rich and due to their smaller population.
