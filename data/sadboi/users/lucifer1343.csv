CPTSD,fpeaxym,t3_gci3pk,1588543883.0,"This thread is so validating. 

I experienced all of this with every therapist I've had. They seriously treat me like I'm unhinged because I believe that shitty childhoods affect people's futures. As if once you turn 18, you're a shiny new adult and your past is erased and has no bearing on the future."
quiteinteresting,fpdtzcq,t1_fpdsymv,1588534191.0,I had the same problem and I started out using dry shampoo to reduce oil instead of daily washing.
CPTSD,fohvle3,t3_g6w42k,1587773495.0,"Same. I'm waiting to die, basically."
CPTSD,fo4dl7b,t3_g57wt6,1587502516.0,"Yep, I'm just waiting to die now that I know I have no hope for a better future. Being financially independent was my only life goal and it's not attainable so I guess I give up. I have less and less energy every year."

CPTSD,fmwlb9p,t1_fmvokol,1586448622.0,"That statement is what made me leave CBT for good. Every single therapist believes that thoughts come  before feelings, it's honestly astounding these people have careers."
CPTSD,flylklw,t3_frn8vu,1585604429.0,"Yep, this is why I sit around looking at reddit all day. Nothing is fun. Everything is about as exciting as standing in line at the DMV so I'd rather just do nothing."
CPTSD,flykvhg,t3_frw206,1585604052.0,I feel the same way. My mental state has gotten worse every year and I don't see that changing any time soon because society isn't going to change. I'd rather just die than spend more energy and effort forcing myself to fit in.

CPTSD,fkonzlr,t3_fjnnbw,1584391182.0,"Adrenal fatigue, maybe? I've felt like this since the end of HS and now I'm in my 30s, I hate it. It's like my brain gave up. Taking meds helped for several years but now I'm tired no matter what."
CPTSD,fi2499u,t3_f59f68,1582071110.0,"Yep, letting people down is one of my least favorite things. It causes a lot of anxiety."

CPTSD,febdc8r,t1_feb3n7w,1578957643.0,It's like we all have the same parent. It took me forever to learn how to ride a bike and get my license because I was so afraid of him.

It's just something I can't think my way out of, I've felt like this since I was a child because my parents were abusive. Being treated like shit as a kid fucks people up pretty good and trauma gets stored in the body. I'm doing what I can to heal but it's a long road and I don't know if I'll ever fully recover."

This feels like it belongs on r/gatekeeping tbh"

CPTSD,f8cj62c,t3_e05hv3,1574461380.0,Same here. We live in a clown world where most terrible people will get away with the horrible things they do. I didn't ask to be here. I don't owe anyone anything.
CPTSD,f8cioam,t3_e0425b,1574461075.0,I have to pretend to be someone I'm not when I'm around other people and I don't have the energy to do it anymore. I just don't care and I'd rather be alone.
CPTSD,f89u75s,t3_dysbna,1574380241.0,"I don't know. It feels literally impossible to change my beliefs. It feels like trying to convince myself that 2+2 is 5.

I feel worthless because I can't do things like hold down a job or keep my house clean or maintain friendships anymore. I feel like a pointless person. 

Why would anyone in my situation feel good about themselves? I've proven that I can't do anything normal people can do."

Nothing makes me feel hopeful anymore but that show is at least a welcome hilarious distraction."
CPTSD,f7cmqra,t3_duuf8j,1573595631.0,"As if 12 hours of therapy is enough to combat 18+ years of trauma. It's laughable. 

I feel like people have to do private therapy instead of going through the NHS if they want to heal properly."
CPTSD,f6uy6nr,t3_dt0klp,1573171638.0,"Don't worry, the same thing has happened to me and I felt like I was going out of my mind dealing with people in my house. I think it's totally normal after having your space taken over. 

The AC broke in the middle of summer and it took a month to fix. They were also rude and incompetent on top of it and in the end I snapped at them because I couldn't take it anymore. I don't even feel bad about it, they sucked.

The other commenter is right: you don't have to be grateful for something you never asked for, your landlord sounds like a dick."

antiwork,f2f4h2e,t1_f2ei2um,1570210438.0,Exactly. I also left at 17 and have gone no contact. They don't seem to care at all so I can only assume I'm doing them a favor.
CPTSD,f21bc0d,t3_dbf99p,1569870176.0,Same here. My PMDD has gotten much worse since I found out I have CPTSD. I'd rather be a disembodied spirit floating around than deal with this shit.

CPTSD,f1qmfy3,t3_dahtl5,1569703337.0,"Yep. In addition to having a problem with blind obedience, I also have very little energy. Waking up early and commuting 5 days a week is enough to take it out of me without even doing the actual job yet. 

The only jobs I can get are wage slavery positions and I've done enough of those at this point that I'd rather be homeless or dead than suffer through another one."
mycology,f1gt3ui,t3_d997o5,1569476441.0,Nice! I've been hoping to see these for a few years and I haven't found any yet. Hopefully this year I will!
CPTSD,f1dmbp6,t3_d8w6e5,1569389530.0,"Yes, my parents never believed I had depression, they said I was making it up for attention. They encouraged me to ""at least pretend to be happy"" so I stopped talking to them about my problems.

If I showed any emotions like sadness or anger they would scream at me about my ""attitude problem."" It took me until my mid 20s to be able to cry in front of anyone without feeling ashamed."
CPTSD,f0nvsyb,t3_d5mcgs,1568782653.0,"The fact that you're even learning this at all is impressive to me. If I had to learn how to drive in a manual car I would have just taken the bus! 

Learning how to drive is anxiety provoking for most people, so try not to be hard on yourself. I agree with the person who said learning how to shift and how to drive are two different things. Practice shifting in a parking lot until you feel comfortable and then focus on the driving, one thing at a time!"
CPTSD,f0kb2ct,t3_d4zs3l,1568674939.0,"Same for me. I don't believe I've ever been happy and I've wanted to die consistently for 13 years now. I haven't been able to enjoy anything since February, this is the worst and longest I've had complete anhedonia. I just want everything to be over so I don't have to think or feel anymore."

CPTSD,ewcnyfx,t3_cnk1pm,1565287763.0,I haven't worked in over 3 years. My last job was terrible and traumatized me further. I honestly don't know how I'll ever work again and it's keeping me trapped in a shame spiral. It doesn't help that every time I go to my psychiatrist or see a new therapist they focus on what I need to do to get a job again. It's clear that most people only value others for their work.
CPTSD,ew539jt,t3_cmker2,1565126029.0,"Yeah, I might have had a career. Instead, I feel like a robot programmed with trauma for a personality."

Knowing they need me helps me get out of bed."

CPTSD,etjnn3y,t3_cc0007,1562877425.0,"Yep, I also had an abusive sociopath for a stepfather. 

I can only think of two specific instances where anyone acknowledged I was being abused and even then nothing happened. Once, my aunt called him out for obviously favoring my best friend over me. The second time was when the woman who lived in the apartment above mine said ""I'm sorry"" to me after she heard him screaming at me for louder and longer than usual.

 I think it does make me feel more worthless and angry knowing that people knew or had an idea of what he was like and did nothing. My own mother witnessed almost every single thing he did and never said a word, only spoke up to agree with him. It seems like people are easily duped by sociopaths and narcissists. Or maybe they're scared of them too? My stepdad is by far the most terrifying person I've ever met.

I guess I try not to think about it too much because there's only so much depression I can take."

When I asked my psychiatrist about seeing a therapist who specializes in trauma she said ""all our therapists are trained to deal with PTSD"" and wouldn't help any further.
