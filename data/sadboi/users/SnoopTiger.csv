soccer,fqs274w,t1_fqr6b49,1589596861.0,"Copied from another reply in this thread:

Ramos 200k, Varange 140k, Marcelo 100k, Carvajal 80k, Casemiro 90k, Modric 180k, Vinicius 40k, Benzema 150k all of them multiple Champions League winners & WC/EUROs winners - if that's not strict to you I don't know what is.

Players like Koke or Frenkie de Jong are paid twice the Kroos salary and you think that's not strict? You are arguing with the fact that he could get bigger salary in different club but you are not right. It's a straight fact, if Kroos went back to Bayern, Juventus, Barcelona, any English club, PSG, Inter etc he would earn much more but not everything in football is about money."

I want to say that hacking a vita is so easy, especially if you use the steps from [vita.hack.guide](https://vita.hack.guide) it's really a piece of cake. The content that there is, is amazing for the hacked vita.

So far one of the best buys from these recent years is my fat OLED Vita. Go for it. If you can buy a 3.65 firmware version, the fat OLED one. So you can put on CFW with less steps. And buy SD2VITA and a micro SD card (if you have one the better). You can download the official games with the NPS Browser from your computer or with the PKGJ app directly with your Vita, it's really amazing.

If you have any more questions I would love to answer them."
