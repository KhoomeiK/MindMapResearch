AskReddit,fpy6xcj,t3_gfsi0q,1588997341.0,"When I was young my best friend had neighbours with a ravine in their backyard. We went out there one night to explore near their house, but ended up going too far down a hill. The sun was setting and as we approached the next hill we saw like 3-4 people bowing down to a fire they had set. All I remember is them turning around and just staring at us, so we ran. I don’t know what it was to this day and when her Dad found us he was furious and said we could have been hurt, so no idea what that was about, perhaps some weird cult in the forest. I remember running for dear life because I could feel their eyes on me the whole time and I just left my friends there."

BPD,foxv2m6,t1_foxl6za,1588157278.0,"This really helped me.. especially the part about attachment. She is the love of my life but the relationship causes me a lot of stress and that’s not her fault. 

I’m glad you relate, that means a lot to me, thank you. I’m trying to train myself but it’s so hard.. like I become someone different and so far away from myself and can’t get back. I become an emotionless monster, almost psychopathic. 

I struggle with drugs too, mostly pot and Xanax, because I don’t like facing these feelings and then those make me worse sometimes or make me feel like I’m not even real.

Anyway, thanks for the response.. just rambling and feeling that familiar glow after waking up from a breakdown a night before and I feel no different... and I have to go to work like everything is fine.

I hate when I get an FP my happiness depends so much on how we’re doing. Fuck."
BPD,foxutiw,t1_fox4hhd,1588157036.0,You could list a Habit as anything and if you don’t do that in the day it can be a red circle and if you end up doing well it becomes a green circle and that’s how I keep track of my moods and habits.
