Wanting and needing affection, but pushing the person away the second I start to feel something. Perhaps being scared of getting hurt.

If I do pursue a relationship with someone, I get the desired affection. Once I've had it, I leave the person because I just don't feel anything again. 

This is fucking hard because the main symptom that borderlines experience is fear of being alone/the fear of abandonment.

I would say this is the hardest part about having BPD. You are not alone."
