I get you hate texting or talking over mobile devices but try to text her/ask for her snap (if youâ€™re decent friends with her she wonâ€™t find it weird, people our age exchange snaps with all the time. And you can just say you enjoy talking to her or you want to talk to more people over snap). Itâ€™s the unfortunate truth that friendships are somewhat carried out digitally nowadays, but give it a try with her."

I was an IVF baby and a preemie, that combined with my mom being stupid and my dad being wicked smart led to me being just smart enough to know how stupid I am and how much potential was wasted on me. My mind hasnâ€™t worked for I donâ€™t know how long- I donâ€™t think, i have trouble making short-term memories and recalling all of my memories, and I just feel like a complete pos. I should be at least able to have my own opinions on things but I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m emotionless most of the time, I canâ€™t relate to people. My brain doesnâ€™t even make many new memories anymore, whatâ€™s the point lmao. 

All of my problems relate to my shitty memory. Please if anyone has any tips/ a miracle cure/ a way to strengthen my brain Iâ€™ll be forever grateful."
