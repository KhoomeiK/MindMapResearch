Edit: the change was all in face structure for me. I see a lot of glow ups involving losing weight or sum like that but I was always a string bean.

When I was in middle school, because I could never wear a tampon, every second day of my period I would have blood leak through my jeans. This usually wasn’t an issue since I was good at hiding it, and could just go to the clinic for a change of pants- but sometimes I would just deal with it since going to the clinic every time was embarrassing. Stupid, yes, but I was scared. 

One of these days, I happened to be wearing a skirt. Although no blood got on the skirt itself, it got on every single chair I sat in that day. It reeked of blood and fish, and in one class, I was shaky and opted to sit on my feet. Other children quietly watched as blood stained my boots, and there was nothing I could do about it but hold back tears and sit as still as possible. Of course we ended up standing to do an activity that day, the only time we had ever stood up to do anything."
