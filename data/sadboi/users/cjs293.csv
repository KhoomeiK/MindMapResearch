dating_advice,fmjac1t,t3_fvmvn5,1586126249.0,"Going to start out by stating the obvious here: I hope you’re not considering meeting up with anyone anytime soon considering our current global issue. 

Now that that’s out of the way, have you talked about if she’s ever met up with anyone before from tinder? I’ve only met up with two guys on there (both dates) and I talked to the first guy for a month before meeting up because I was genuinely concerned he could end up being a creep or someone who could hurt me. Not that I thought this from our conversations but just being a female and hearing horror stories of tinder and Uber and such. So it took me a while. The second guy I talked to I asked to meet up within a few days. 

If she seems genuine about needing time to feel comfortable, then you’ll either have to accept it or move on. If you think she’s beating around the bush about not wanting to meet up at all and just pushing it til it fades out, then I think you know your answer there. 

But if you genuinely think you guys have a connection, ask what her concerns are and what would make her feel comfortable."
relationship_advice,fmhvktf,t1_fmhp8eh,1586094847.0,"1000% agree. Hopefully she’s just temporarily butt hurt and she’ll understand. If not, you’ll get a good idea of her true maturity level. Being annoyed and moody about something like that at a time like this is quite petty and selfish.

I would say that she might be depressed from what she went through the past year, but I feel that her mom would’ve vouched for that or she would’ve come clean about that after you questioning her about what’s going on.  All that’s left is the sketchy option and you don’t deserve that. You’ve said your piece and if it isn’t true and if she wants to be with you, she will come back.

dating,fgltamf,t3_ez9o5e,1580910416.0,"I [23F] wouldn’t mind a “dad-vibe” person the way you’ve described it. The only time I would care is if that also includes lecturing me about my life or being controlling in relationships. But if all that dad-vine means Is that you’re dependable and nurturing, then how could there be anything wrong with that? They say girls will go for the bad-boy but honestly, if they do why would you want them if that’s not who you are naturally? You shouldn’t change who you are because of these comments from your friends. As cheesy as it sounds, someone will come along that will love you for who you are. I personally like emotional nurturing guys, guys who want to take care of me — as long as they recognize my independence as well. Nothing wrong with that."

thebachelor,ffvmgcx,t1_ffvm9tc,1580267588.0,Honestly the way she acted when he wanted to talk to her before the rose ceremony was complete manipulation. “No I don’t want to talk to you” and then switching to “no let me talk” before the conversation even started.

I doubt anyone could live in those conditions with 14 girls telling you how awful you are. I really think what she was saying was right: people took her big personality as her being fake. That coupled with VP’s “story” of their lack of friendship makes Alayah seem like a liar. It’s all unfair but I think it would be easier on everyone if they just went home.

relationship_advice,ffse9pq,t3_euz7f1,1580179602.0,"Close the group or transfer admin (depending on the app) and then leave. I (23F) left group chats from college that no longer serve me. Especially with friends where they were talking crap on someone else or taking something too far, even my closest group of friends. No time for toxicity or negativity and if they’re gonna give you shit for that, then they aren’t mature enough. If their conversation makes you uncomfortable, you have every right to leave. And yeah they’ll probably bust your balls about it or talk shit, but they’ll get over it if they’re really your friends. Trust me. Plus, other people could be feeling that way but just jumping on the bandwagon of the conversation and not want to leave the convo for the same reason you’re saying. You never know. Either way, life is too short to spend time on negativity and toxic relationships. You can also have an honest conversation about all this and straight up say “hey guys, this isn’t cool” and explain how you’re feeling. Once again, if they’re mature they’ll respect it. And if they don’t respect what you’re saying and they’re continuing with those jokes, do you really wanna be friends with them?

Edit: I just read more of the post. Before I only really read intro and TLDR. Fuck them, close the group chat and screw worrying about inquiries. They have a problem with it? Oh well. You definitely don’t want to be a part of that. Like you said, it’s disgusting they are doing that"

I’ll try to parallel park twice and then just park far away and it’s so embarrassing when someone is in the car with me. It doesn’t help that my car is way longer than a normal car so my perception is just off. 

But the anxiety leading up to it is the worst for me. I had to drive into a city for Christmas Eve to see my grand parents and this was my first time driving alone. I was worrying about it for weeks so much so that I was considering taking a train and then ubering to their house instead which would’ve cost a crazy amount of money. Literally all this anxiety just because of parking. 

I’m glad someone else can relate. And I can’t figure out how to get over it. I just can’t wait til I get a new car (hopefully this year) that has more normal, smaller dimensions."
