Do it in a place where you don't have to hide the fact that you are high, and when your mood is good and stable. At least inform someone of your plans and have them there with you or available over the phone/whatsapp. While your drug hunting anyways, see if you can get some Diazepam or similar to take in case your trip goes south."

My reason for bringing it up is because it was offered to me (pure seminoma stage 1) and after going over the pros and cons, surveillance was chosen (13 years ago, knock on wood).

Apparently, chemo is better tolerated, but if you should need it later on it doesn't work as well if you've had it before.

Could be worth your while discussing with your urologist. I'm not sure how surveillance fits in with 1b, ask them about it."
