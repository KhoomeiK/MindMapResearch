depression,fhg93t1,t1_fhg6vsx,1581561416.0,"I appreciate the kind words and different perspective. But I am abusing it. It was a genuine source of relief for awhile, but I'm asking it to do much and my body is responding to the over-frequency. I get terrible allergic symptoms when I smoke now and I've developed a chronic (pun intended) hacking cough. When I lay down I can hear my lungs wheezing. But the really damning evidence is the dialogue between myself, myself and the plant when I actually do smoke enough to get high. It changed from being a source of relief and deep reflection, like talking to a dear friend, to being a habit of diminishing returns that treats the symptoms sometimes.

I have experience with other psychedelics as well. I see them as medicines. Medicines can be abused too.

I wish you good fortune in your journeys and battles"

But I'm the one that sits here not doing anything so I must conclude that this is the best I can do.

I woke up one day and it was like I had nothing left. No drive. No hope. No concern that I had no nope. Just a dead circuit. Actually I shouldn't say that. I get really fucking angry at the drop of a hat now, for reasons I would have easily dismissed 5 years ago. So it's either angry, sad, bored or some combination. Oh and I guess the self loathing never really goes away either."

I smoke up everyday so I can get some partial relief, but my tolerance is so high now I have to smoke a lot to get anywhere. Porn went from being a daily indulgence to an occasional chore. Everything is pointless and boring and too much trouble. Even killing myself would be too much of an inconvenience. I want to just wink out of existence and be gone.
