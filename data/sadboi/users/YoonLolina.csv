She's a highschool teacher, and has been for a lot of years. When I was a little girl (no more than six years old), there was suddenly this teenager living with us. I remember that my mom just told us that she was gonna stay with us for a while. I didn't think much of it, except for the fact that I loved that girl and she used to treat me so nicely, and she used to play a lot with me (unlike my siblings, which is why I liked her). I don't remember her name, but the time I spent with her was amazing.

However, she was suddenly gone one day. Life went on, but I always thought of her and how nice she was. So, naturally, when I got older, I asked my mom about her and exactly_why_ she had lived with us for a while.

It turns out that she lived very far away, so she couldn't travel daily to go to classes, and her parents weren't active figures in her life. If she stayed at home with her grandma, she would be given chores that would not give her the time to go to highschool and she once told all of this to my mom.

And just like that, my parents opened our home for her. She needed stability, she needed to live like a normal teenager and -even though my mom and dad had her hands full with three young kids -my parents provided that for her. Even if it was for s short period of time, because she went back home a little before classes ended.

I just remembered this girl and a nice kind-of older sister that played with me and was nice, completely oblivious to why she was in my home; but my mom actually told me that she was so grateful to see how much I liked her and tried to be with her (I'm not a very social person, never been) because the change showed greatly on that girl.

We never saw her again, except for one time. But my mom keeps in touch, and one of these days she told me that she always asks for us. 

The way my mom changed that girl's life and how easily she accepted the challenge to do it is something I'll always admire her for."

Once, when I was on my way to my best friend's house, one of her neighbors was out in their garden with a little girl that's her niece.

Then, when I was about to get to my best friend's house it hit me: the aunt (plus mom and other aunts) of these little girl are not pretty _at all_. I don't like to call people ugly, but they really have almost nothing on their favour. Physically speaking, they are not pretty. Not even close to it.

So, this little girl has grown up seeing them and forming her standard of prettiness according to her family, which as I said... They're not objectively pretty. This means, she thinks they are pretty, and would consider anyone similar to them pretty as well.

Which means, I don't look like her family. Therefore, I'm ugly to her, because I don't have similar features to the ones her aunts and mom have.

My mood was lifted when I thought of that. I may not be the prettiest of them all, but I don't look like her family, and for me that means I'm not objectively ugly.

Kids are honest, of course. But kids are honest according to the standard of normality they have known in their short life. They won't ever have a neutral and objective point of view."

I've seen them mention it less and less with third/fourth gen idols, but second gen idols are very open about it. 

With height being such an important aspect for them (I'm not sure if it's a cultural thing, I just know that in the kpop industry it is something that they look up to), it's common for idols to be very sensitive about their real height. This applies specially for male idols, although you can also see some of this with female idols.

They used to be more open about using insoles before though, and I remember seeing ""old"" idols make a lot of jokes about it. Now it's more... It's not that they don't use them anymore, but they don't say it aloud as often as before.

I don't know how to put it, but they get very offended when others try to joke with their height. For example Jinhwan, from iKON, gets _really mad_ when his members try to talk about his height. There's also Jinwoo from WINNER, but he takes it a lil more lightly. Another example is Woozi from Seventeen, who is considered one of the smallest male idols in the industry, and although he's not very sensitive about his height, neither he nor his members touch that subject.

If she went NC with you, there must have been a lot piling up in her side to make that decision. This wasn't just because of one thing, this decision must've had a lot of reasons behind it.

If you want to right your wrongs, send her a text/email explaining her that you _understand_ how selfish you were and then _give her space_. It's now up to her to decide if she wants your drama in her life."
AmItheAsshole,fj72wt4,t1_fj6iea1,1583085356.0,"This exactly. NTA, OP.

You're already out and you don't need to hide yourself anymore. The fact that your boyfriend is basically demanding you to go back to the closet in front of his parents is a very selfish and cruel thing to do. 

Just because he got caught in the lie and doesn't feel ready to tell his parents the truth it doesn't mean you have to force yourself to be someone you're not."

Basically, your gf probably has the same mindset as them. Do you want that type of SO for the rest of your life?"
AmItheAsshole,fj4172f,t3_fbaqn2,1582997920.0,"NTA. Her hatred for children is not only unhealthy, but borderline pathetic as well. Your brother is not a kid, and the fact that your gf refuses to even _speak_ with a 16 yo boy is _very_ weird."

Even if your relationship is over, please make sure that your niece is aware that you're a safe place for her."

Oh, and when people find out that I live with my brother and he's cleaner than me. It's like something fries in their brain. They simply _cannot_ understand how he likes to clean and I don't, and it's even worse when I tell them he's actually the one who likes to cook _and it's good at it_."

Sometimes depression shows itself not as wanting to die, rather as wanting to live but _not knowing how._ 

In the mess of it all, you can confuse those two. Despite it, what kept me going were the little things: to see the rain one more time, to hug my mom again, to feel better someday."
The10thDentist,fh140to,t1_fh0apro,1581210655.0,"Agree with this.

The movie, from a psychological point of view, was amazing. So much so that it makes you sit down and analyze the character, which has _so much_ to give.

It was a mess, of course, but have you ever seen/read anything about the Joker? He's a mess. The movie was being told by his perspective, of course it would represent him. Just because is a mess doesn't mean it was bad. Art is like that. You can do whatever you want and people can interpret it however they want and still be something worthy."

If your bf doesn't want to press charges, then support him, but the people around him need to know. Just because she's a girl she doesn't get a pass. She doesn't deserve forgiveness, even less so when she actually tried to make him the bad one. 

I doubt she ""really really didn't want to"". She raped him, then when she realized what she did she tried to play victim, and it wasn't until your boyfriend put her on the spot of ""I'm gonna press charges"" that she changed her story and begged for forgiveness. 

_She's not sorry for what she did and for lying afterwards, she's sorry she was caught._

Your family and friends need to know the truth, because she made him a villain and accused him of something _horrible_, something _she did_. And she needs to be the one telling the truth. No one's gonna believe you nor him, she *has* to be the one clearing all this mess."

AskReddit,fgv1j61,t3_f0dmuv,1581134539.0,"Okay, so my first language is spanish, and there are some words (as there are in every other language) that, when said slightly wrong, can mean something else entirely. For example, ""peine"" means hairbrush, and ""pene"" means penis. In an specific example of the country I live in, pizza is well, pizza, and ""picha"" is also penis.

As you can imagine, those are words that any toddler could easily confuse and that's exactly what it happens with my niece. She's four and whenever she wants pizza or wants a hairbrush I have to do my best not to laugh or react to the words she's actually saying."

Turns out, our arts and math teachers were having sex at our french teacher's classroom and he found them doing it. It was quite a mess, both were married and had children- actually, the art teacher's sons are twins and they have my age. This means, they had to go through that humiliation and all the rumors that followed.

Bot teachers played dumb (even our french teacher acted as if nothing happened) but it was useless. The entire high school knew what had happened and nobody except them tried to pretend otherwise.

It eventually died down, but it was hard for me to treat them with respect afterwards."
