depression,fe92x1w,t1_fe8pga5,1578933635.0,I think you meant to reply to a comment further up but accidentally made a top level comment.
depression,fe4o90t,t1_fe4ctbd,1578861294.0,"I find it quite admirable and brave that you're willing to share so much with your friends. I am very sorry to say, however, that I can't read a 9 page document. It is too much for me right now. 

I hope you find the insight and shared understanding that you're looking for.

Edit: I should expand on this, because I don't want you to feel like you're not valued. I suffer from severe ME/CFS, which causes extreme fatigue and brain fog. Reading 9 pages takes a hugely disproportionate amount of my daily concentration and energy. I literally can't do it. I'm sorry."

> that most likely I'm just using it to manipulate people by puttintg on a show.

I started to talk to this friend of mine but then immediately felt like I was somehow manipulating her into feeling sympathy or something? Nothing I could say felt authentic yet an authentic connection is really what I needed to feel."

I guess i am just struggling to imagine anyone being willing to entertain a new relationship with someone so sick."
