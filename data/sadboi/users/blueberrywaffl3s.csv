I have started to refrain from googling my symptoms because I always end up convincing myself I have something way worse. I also hate ruling out myself being sick, because I always feel like Karma‚Äôs gonna come bite me in the ass and actually make me sick.

My mouth also gets dry and I start to feel nauseous the more I think about how I physically feel. Even when I see TV ads like you said, once I‚Äôve seen something bad on TV health related, It‚Äôs plastered into my memory forever, and if I even experience one symptom, I automatically I assume I have it."
