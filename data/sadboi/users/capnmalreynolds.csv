relationships,fqfafoi,t1_fqf7ugi,1589321438.0,"I hear you. Feel free to disregard any and all of this, but here are some of the lessons I took from couples counseling:

1. Practice daily gratitude. Every day, find something about your BF that you're grateful for and tell him that. It can be something small like that he doesn't leave the toilet seat up. It can be big things too, but the point is it lets him know you see and appreciate him as well as helps you to see the reasons why you love him. This only works if you both do it, but if it becomes a habit it makes a big difference.
2. When you are in conflict, both of you need to stop and take a minute to do your best to look at the situation from your partner's point of view. If you're spiraling down into a fight, ask if you can pause and take a minute to calm down and catch a breath. Think about who they are, what major life events shaped them, and how it might skew their point of view such that something that doesn't seem like a big deal to you is a major issue for them. Even if it's not entirely reasonable that they (or you) are so bent out of shape by it, showing that you understand where they're coming from and why it's important to them will go a long way towards helping a fight from getting too big.
3. Communicate, communicate, communicate. If one of you is worried the other is upset with them, ask. What might never have been a fight could develop into one because you misinterpret his stress about work as being anger at you (or vice versa). Talk to each other about what's going on, check in with each other so things are defused before they spin out of control.
4. Be aggressively invested in your partner's sexual satisfaction and expect the same treatment from him. Make sure you both get what you want in the bedroom and that neither person leaves sex dissatisfied. If you're not sure what he wants and vice versa, talk about it. If there's something you want to try ask if he'd be willing to try it and be open and non-judgmental of what he asks of you. I'm not saying let him do whatever he wants - you can and should have boundaries around what you will and won't do but being open to new things and showing he can trust you to talk about it and vice versa can be very powerful. Sex should be a banquet where no one walks away from the table hungry.
5. Make time for sex. This may be more relevant for me and my wife as we're in our mid to late forties with 3 kids and work etc. etc., but having sex regularly with the stuff I mentioned in #4 above makes a big difference in our respective patience with each other and being able to not sweat the little stuff. It sands down the rough edges on life and makes it easier for us to be relaxed at work and with our kids.

That's all I've got for now. If any of the above is helpful and I think of anything else I can add it on later."
AskReddit,fqf6p5r,t1_fqf2ii9,1589319624.0,"That's what I don't get. The show is on a major network, they have clearly invested millions of dollars in it and assembled a talented cast - why would they be okay with writing that sloppy? Then again, GoT season 8 was a thing, so what do I know?"
AskReddit,fqf6hpn,t1_fqf2zqn,1589319525.0,"There's enough fun stuff in there and Nathan Fillion keeps me in, but even he has his limits.

Season 2 had some good moments so I'll give season 3 a shot, but if it doesn't get better then I'll probably be done."
relationships,fqf65yr,t1_fqf26r1,1589319368.0,There's no reason only married couples can do it. It's for two people in a relationship who want to make it work but are struggling. If you guys aren't able to work it out in a way that lasts on your own maybe it's time to get help. I will forever be grateful to the therapist who helped us.
relationships,fqf0kdf,t3_giisy6,1589316698.0,"My wife and I went through some tough times 10 years ago. My wife gave me an ultimatum - go to couples counseling with her, or divorce. We went for couples counseling for around two years. We had to face a lot of tough things about our relationship and learn to better appreciate each other. It was really hard and tense, but we're still married now and are committed to going the distance. Relationships can be saved if you're willing to put in the work to learn how to communicate constructively what you need and hear when your partner does the same. For my part, I had to stop fixating about what she was bringing and force myself to take responsibility for my actions and work to fix them and be a better person. It sucked a lot - I didn't want to admit that I had a lot of problems I needed to fix. But I trusted her to address her stuff while I worked on mine and it worked out. 

Having an objective third party really helped us to see things we were too close to and hold us responsible for what we needed to work on. Good luck to you both, I hope you are able to figure out what will be best for you to do whether that's staying together or going your separate ways."

Everyone else has pretty clearly addressed the ridiculousness of the ending, so I'll leave that be. Something I found intensely frustrating was Nolan taking calls in front of serial killer lady. If the writers/producers did even a little bit of research they would know you cannot bring cell phones into jails or prisons. You have to check them in a locker or leave them in your car (depending on the facility) or you will be denied entrance for security reasons and to prevent inmates from having unauthorized contact with people outside.

I had that thought about the ridiculousness of not saying what the dream job was too, but figured I'd ranted enough about other issues that I should leave it off. As to your question about what's typical for social workers, it varies widely. There's lots of folks who are county ""lifers"" like me who will be there until they retire, but I've also known folks who did a few years and then went into non-governmental social work (Foster Family Agency, hospital/medical social work, etc.). There really isn't a typical dream job for social workers which makes it all the more ridiculous that she never said what it is. She might as well have said ""We need conflict in our relationship to give some type of plot to the show, but let's half-ass it with as few details as possible."" I also think them putting Huntington's out there and then just dropping it was a bit lame. I'm glad it got mentioned as it needs greater public awareness, but again it just feels like lazy writing.

TheRookie,foreuit,t3_g8n0ko,1588011031.0,"I enjoyed much of this episode, but the sub-plot of the sick child being removed by Rachel bugged the hell out of me. Pardon me while I get on my soap-box, but that just is not how DCFS works (source: I’ve worked for DCFS since 6/20/97, almost 23 years). While it is true once upon a time we used to remove kids like that strictly on our say-so (sometimes with police escort), that hasn’t been the case for roughly 15 years. We were very rightly sued for violating civil rights and a new procedure was created. 

We now have to apply for a removal order in advance of all non-emergent detentions where a child isn’t at immediate risk of harm. In this case although Munchausen’s by Proxy is highly serious and can be life-threatening, it takes A LOT of evidence to prove. Further it sounded like this mother would’ve had ample medical records to show her following up on her son’s sickness. While the child was sick, there was nothing in a ten minute home call to show immediate risk of harm. There was no attempt to get collateral information from the child’s doctors, other family members, school, etc. 

For the sake of argument, let’s say this was done as an emergency detention with a detention hearing set within 72 hours of the removal as required by law. DCFS would’ve then had to justify it in court before a judge with attorneys appointed to for the parents and child. I can guarantee at a minimum the child would’ve been returned to the mother (if not the whole case dismissed) with such a piss-poor investigation. 

Let’s further say that by some miracle the case was not immediately dismissed. Rachel was stressing about that child being wrongly detained in foster care and her unable to take it back. Again, not at all true - when we find new information exonerating parents we present it at court and depending on the case ask for return and sometimes even outright dismissal. I have personally signed off on reports recommending dismissal when my worker investigated further and found that a tragic accident was just that and not actual abuse or neglect by the parents.

Lastly, the explanation of him being sickened by well water makes no sense. Why wasn’t the mother similarly sickened? Shouldn’t there be a bunch of other children in the community falling similarly ill? Sorry for such a long diatribe, but I’m sick of seeing CPS used as an easy plot point for lazy writers."

He has always been the busiest boy with very little patience for pets or being held before he wanted down to explore. Last night was his first night alone in the cage and when I took him out this morning he just wanted to be held and snuggled. He stayed in my hand/lap for over an  hour and bruxxed a ton, something he seldom did before. I know rats shouldn’t ever be kept alone, but with the pandemic and most non-essential businesses closed down I don’t know how we could get new friends for him.

relationship_advice,flqxk0b,t1_flqos5z,1585408533.0,"They’re not just having sex, he describes it as dating for four months. Early in a relationship, but long enough to know each other a bit and like what they see. You’re seriously comparing this woman who’s been in a monogamous relationship with this guy for four months, with Wilt Chamberlain? A professional basketball player whose career spanned 24 years of traveling all over the US having one night stands in every city he went to with a claimed 20K+ women? That’s not even remotely the same thing. 

As for me, it’s true I haven’t dated in a while, I’ve been with the same woman since 1994. Early in our relationship we compared numbers and she more than doubled me. And you know what? That burned my pride at the time, not gonna lie. But I got over that shit because being with her made me happy and I knew there was a double standard there that guys are allowed to have a high score but women who do are seen as promiscuous. She’s always liked sex and chosen to have it with guys she wanted before me, why should she be ashamed of that? She didn’t catch STDs, didn’t sleep with just anyone who came on to her, and didn’t get unintentionally pregnant. I’m the last name on her list and have been since we’ve been together. Getting over that male ego bullshit has meant I’ve had 26 years and counting with her, 22 of them married. I have three sons I adore and a wife who loves me and still wants sex on the regular and is the best lay of my life. 

If being with a woman who has a higher score is a problem for guys and they can’t get over it then sure, they can bail. They’ll be doing the woman a favor, honestly. But if that’s the only reason and everything else in the relationship is good, they love the woman, she’s faithful to them and the sex is good, then they’re the ones with the problem, not the women."

AskReddit,flkye17,t1_flkqtzj,1585250016.0,"Not OP, but I just researched this question and [this](https://shevibe.com/njoy-pure-wand-double-ended-steel-dildo.aspx) seems to be the most popular. It has the advantages of:

1. It has two different sized ends so it offers options for girth preferences

2. It is usable both for men and women (both vaginally and anally for women). I found tons of folks of both genders who RAVED about it. So far I have only tried it with my wife, haven’t worked up the courage to take the plunge yet. She had some initial sticker shock when I told her how much it cost, but having now used it she is 100% sold on it. 

3. It is medical grade stainless steel and very easy to clean. If you use it anally you should sterilize it by boiling it for 5 minutes before using it vaginally, but otherwise very simple.

4. It is suitable for home defense - you have to hold it to believe, it but it is heavy and could easily be used as a club. 

You can get it from a variety of places and you should definitely shop for deals, I just linked one source."

TheRookie,flk1pny,t1_flj4l02,1585232036.0,"Agreed on the understanding point. You can't truly understand it until you live through the process of losing someone you love by inches over the course of years with them fully aware of and upset by the process, but powerless to stop it.  I have so many moments with my dad and my brother burned into my brain that I wish I could forget where they were trying to do something simple but couldn't and getting really frustrated, or angry, or sad."
TheRookie,flgwf29,t1_flcgbuh,1585151612.0,"Yeah, although I felt like it was a bit of a stretch for Rachel's dad to be asymptomatic. HD is an anticipatory disease where successive generations typically have an earlier onset of symptoms.  My dad's started in his 50s or thereabouts, my brother's became symptomatic in his mid 30s.  If Rachel's dad had a parent who was symptomatic I would think he would have been experiencing some symptoms. I'm probably nit-picking though, and honestly I'm glad to see it get some more exposure so people have some awareness of it. As /u/BettyWhiteCastle pointed out it was a thing on House, but good to see it show up in entertainment again."

insaneparents,fl03rv1,t1_fkzy5tp,1584690316.0,"I believe I work for the same county. So many elements you describe down to the verbiage of the director (BC) match that it can’t be a coincidence. I will say that the county has placed and received a massive order for masks, gloves, and hand sanitizer with more to come. Distribution is being worked out along with ways to try to minimize risk to social worker, children, parents, service providers, and substitute caregivers. I say minimize because of course there is no way to remove that risk doing what we do in a pandemic situation. 


You make excellent points about how if we do this poorly not only do we risk great harm to ourselves, we risk it to those we work with, our families, and the communities we live in. We are doing our best to plan for the least harm possible while still ensuring the safety of the families we serve. This post is all about how the need for CPS is even greater now than in normal times. Not only are children potentially locked in with their abusers, they are not being seen by mandated reporters so by the time problems come to our attention it will because they are much worse than when we usually get involved.


At the end of the day, do what you have to do morally and ethically in this scenario. I just want you to know that we are aware of these concerns and are trying to work on them. Thank you for the blood, sweat, tears, and countless hours of overtime I’m sure you’ve done in the Service of Children and Families while working for the Department."

It was just such a heartbreaking experience realizing my one rat's breathing was off, googling the symptoms and what they meant, and having to tell two of my sons who were anxiously waiting the results of my research next to me that our rat was very very sick and it was likely too late to be able to help him.  He went from being energetic and cuddly to opening his mouth and clicking with every breath in a matter of hours, it was so heartbreaking.  I guess that's just part of the risk of having rats."
