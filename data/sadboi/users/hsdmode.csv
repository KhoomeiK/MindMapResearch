SexWorkers,fq5vfg6,t1_fq5kxxa,1589118475.0,I mean they're levels to sex work. If she was an active Stripper or FSSW probably not. By the time we came into the picture she was transitioning out and turning over a new leaf. She did have a sugar daddy though but the work work was behind her by the time she was babysitting us. She also went to our church so she checked enough boxes morally. Only the adults knew about her SW past. None of the younger people knew. She was trying to establish herself in a new life and we were helping her do that. Our church gave her an opportunity to get out. She was only doing SW because she was from a low-income background and had no other options or skills. We helped her gain some new ones. I wouldn't have a problem if all the right conditions are met and the life was mostly behind her. If she was knee-deep in the thick of it then probably not.

SexWorkers,fq19zey,t1_fq0eivb,1589043646.0,Some asshole wanted her all to himself and when she laid the hammer that she will never be his woman he killed her. She didnt die from sex work per say but it was still a possessive dickhead who took her out. It really rocked our family even the hyper religious ones in the family were up in arms about it when it went down. It made the news but out of respect for her fam I'm not gonna link the article.

AskAcademia,fpx2jcs,t3_gfqqkc,1588974448.0,"In the short term you could start a web based resume company. Depending on your creative writing skills and ability to stir up a crowd you could do speechwriting for some local politicians and get your profile up. I know there is definitely a strong market for resume writing, CV, and cover letters and people ready and willing to pay for those services. If you have a base package of $125 for resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn rewrite and had 30 clients a month that's $45,000yr minus operating  costs. You could adjunct as a side hustle if you really wanted to teach. But you could scale this business tho so it's really up to you on what you want to do..."

BipolarReddit,fmt99cn,t3_fx4b6i,1586368908.0,"Congratulations this is major!!! 

I am blessed to have come across this thread. Starting a Grad program in June and hope to get enough research done to parlay that into a thesis for a PhD in Social Psychology. 

I really don't come across a lot of us in my normal life but its refreshing and to some degree riveting to hear about others achieving at the highest levels. Especially coming from some of the same places we come from dealing and succeeding with Bipolar Disorder."
BipolarReddit,fmsnncb,t3_fwn9su,1586358935.0,"God this was years ago, but it started with a dose similar to yours and gradually increased over time. I think at its peak probably 15-20mg. 

The side effect to watch out for is increased appetite. You will eat and eat and eat and never get full. Then you'll sleep alot so the pounds stack up. Long-term use significantly increases your chances of getting diabetes because it fucks with your blood sugar levels. 

The tradeoff was too great for me"
BipolarReddit,fmojw4r,t1_fmncfid,1586261299.0,"Yea. Even though things were extremely fucked up for 22yrs they were only moderately fucked up the following few years. The last few have been great so eventually shit got better. Significantly better. 

The moral of the story is that shit is always darkest before dawn. Don't give up. Eventually shit will get better if you keep fighting. It might take a while but it will get better. 

Get better OP. Things will work out"
BipolarReddit,fmlt3os,t1_fmkta0s,1586192727.0,Then yea it's just a hypothesis for now. There's still more work to be done.
BipolarReddit,fmkikn4,t3_fvnlzn,1586156176.0,Absolutely. In my grandest moment I developed a scientific theory to prove the existence of God. It hasn't helped anyone but myself and my immediate family though. My advisor at the school I got my undergrad (Christian School) wants me to come back and build it out in their PhD program but I'm not really a fan of limiting God to any particular religion or practice. Though it took some time 10yrs I managed to prove that the theory works. Unfortunately its gonna take another 10yrs or so before I get to the point where I'm confident the results can be replicated for others.
BipolarReddit,fmkgt95,t3_fvrj38,1586154464.0,"First things first DO NOT TRUST GOOGLE.

If you call your insurance company they'll give you a list of doctors in your area. It'd probably be good to get a primary care physician too so that they can make sure the psychoactive drugs don't endanger your physical health like zyprexa and Respuderal(sp) Work your way down the list until you're comfortable. Sometimes you need a fresh perspective if the old one hasn't worked. 

Once you get the list be explicitly clear about how the meds aren't helping. Explain your symptoms and do all the tests. Talk about your lifestyle  and your goals. I moved out of state and the psychiatrist my insurance company referred was phenomenal. Ask the Doc if they keep up with the research on Bipolar Disorder. My doc did and 5 yrs ago got me on a combination that has been nothing short of a miracle for me and my life. 

You have to take your meds everyday. Getting better won't happen unless you can find a combination that you can take everyday. Bipolar Drugs aren't narcotics or allergy meds they're maintenance drugs meaning you have to build up enough in your system and keep the levels in the right range to feel any effect.

You'll get better OP. You just gotta keep moving. Bipolar Disorder is a lifetime thing and as with life it comes in many different seasons. Soon you'll enter a better season. Just focus on getting better now."
BipolarReddit,fmkftxo,t3_fvrjji,1586153519.0,"I've been there. I felt like giving up and was on my way to jump off a pier and drown (can't swim). On my way I was about half way there and I stopped. I stopped and asked myself why? Why did I want to die? It's a simple question really. I wanted to die because for 22yrs of my life every single solitary fucked up thing that could've possibly went wrong has gone wrong. I've failed at every solitary endeavor I've ever embarked upon. Most people detested me. I was battling drug addiction, alcohol addiction, homelessness, poverty, no healthy relationships with anybody, and literally the only thing left to do was to just lay down and die and accept that shit. 

I then realized up until that point I'd only ever done what was expected of me. To be a failure and to die a failure. Having gone an entire lifetime and never see the light even though I searched for it desperately. I had to come to terms with the fact that the God I believed in had failed me. Either God doesn't exist or everything I knew about God was a lie and we were all intrinsically doomed if that was the case. 

I could never subscribe to the notion that there isnt a God. I mean there is most certainly a higher power up there. I needed that God. Not the one we read about in the Bible. Not the one they preach in the Quran or the Torah. I mean the real deal. 

I don't recommend this but I figured I'm on death's door. Nobody knows where I am. Right now whether I live or die is between me and God. If I'm meant to live he'll intervene and I'll live. If I'm meant to die having only known hell then my spirit was intrinsically bound for eternal damnation anyway and Jesus wasn't the savior. 

Well when I said my last prayer shortly afterwards I was relieved of consciousness and I awoke in a psych ward.  I was on my way to die and I prayed ready to die and God took a way my mind and gave it back once I was safe and able to finally get some help. 

I was on death's door and I pulled God up about letting me live my entire life all the way until death and he never showed up. But it seems that even though I was ready to die that way having never felt God's love he saw to it that it be a different way. 

What saved me was a belief in a higher power and surrendering or rather submitting to the will of said power not for salvation but for understanding and peace. 

OP you gotta find peace and get to the root of why you're hurting. Check yourself in to a facility if you need some time to figure things out. Sometimes we can't change the way we've been forced to live in the past but we control whether we choose to die in our suffering. The same way you want to end it you can also make the choice not to die and demand that God show up in your life. Hold the God you pray to accountable for the life you have. Work with your higher power to liberate yourself from your pain and suffering."
BipolarReddit,fmkchwg,t3_fvn2mf,1586150526.0,"I used to feel like that in the beginning. An old lover from that period when I was first dealing with mania taught me about blogging as a means of talking to yourself in a way that is constructive meaning I get out what I want to say, but intimately private as the blog is private and the only person who knows what's there is myself and maybe God if you believe in that. You don't need an audience because most times our minds when afflicted with Bipolar Disorder are so complex that nobody will really understand anyway especially if your manic. 

While I was in Shephard Pratt I roomed with a guy who had a PhD in Mathematics. He explained to me that most times there's a very thin line separating genius from insanity. Often times you have to dip over the line before you hit a breakthrough. That only things that separates the two are time and perception.  I've learned in my experience to record your breakthroughs while you're in the moment. Especially when you're manic. A popular misconception is that we have different sides to us. One way when we're fine. One way when we're depressed. One way when when we're manic. The truth is there's only 1 you. 1 person. You need a safe space where you don't have to be anything other than yourself and most times its safest to explore who that is when it's just you. There's always someone listening. You're listening and the higher power you subscribe to is listening. So at bare minimum you always have an audience of one. Go to blogger and set up a private blog and say everything thing you need to in a safe place that you'll always control. Where you can always be you. Where you can always be free. 

Hope this helps!!!"

confession,fle2jdo,t3_fo5ujg,1585076388.0,"I used to be an internet and voice rep at Spectrum. Whenever we get a slow speed call the first thing we'd do would be to check the connection and signal strength to the modem assuming that's good we'd remote into the router and check the number of devices connected and also the number of Wifi networks in the area that could be interfering with the Wifi. At least 6 calls a day was about neighbors stealing each others wifi. All it takes is a call to the ISP and they'd be able to figure it out in about 6min and change the password to something unbreakable then you're screwed. Just get your own Wifi dude. 

Ps. Spectrum is giving two months of 100mbps internet free if you sign up because of COVID-19 and needing to work from home. Comcast has a deal going too."
