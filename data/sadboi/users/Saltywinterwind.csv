bigdickproblems,fr26l91,t3_gm5kh4,1589832023.0,I think you come on this sub to find what you want. Some people come here to address problems the have is find out the have in fact larger then most. Some definitely come here and see a bunch of dudes claiming to have big dicks and see a circle jerk. Some come here to lie and act like the have a big dick. The core community tho I think is those dudes who remind everyone that it doesn‚Äôt matter you have a big dick and that this is a safe space

Not even big dick, people would say look at saltywinterwinds dick. He‚Äôs gotta be hard hehehe. Shit like that suckkked. I think experiences like that are why I‚Äôve been self conscious of my dick size for a long time. Know I was a bit bigger but I hide it and coming to BDP got me to see the funnier side of having a big dick. You can laugh about shit that used to hurt you and that‚Äôs called growth. Yeah some people humble brag but whatever. If you wanna go on Reddit and say hehe I have a 7.5 inch dick. You do you. But there are people who come here and realize it‚Äôs not bad to have a big dick. Just like it‚Äôs not a good thing ether. Everything ps positives and negatives"
AskMen,fr21fkg,t1_fr1usjx,1589829508.0,I always think along the lines of you can‚Äôt compare your low point to someone‚Äôs high point.

childfree,fqur7sb,t1_fquduhv,1589663345.0,I thinks it‚Äôs more you only have so much time and people don‚Äôt want to waste it.
