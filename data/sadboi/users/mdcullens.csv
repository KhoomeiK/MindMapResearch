lifehacks,ffnea1a,t1_ffnanha,1580064815.0,I agree. The metal corners are overall better than the plastic ones. I tried using them once and they tend to be a pain to work with

bipolar,ffgdau1,t3_etgakc,1579903691.0,Medication helps close the wound but the wound will never heal unless you help yourself heal. You’re both wrong lmao. You have to be willing to put in the effort everyday if you want to see a change. Only using medicine to fix an issue really never works from what I’ve seen.

relationship_advice,ffcfv3r,t3_esufvn,1579798566.0,"Should you leave? No that’s pretty awful. He’s not cut out to be a doctor and that’s okay, it’s hard. You should support him, not push him. If he wants to be in the medical field and he is dealing with anxiety and depression maybe you should recommend a psychological field for him to pursue as a job."

BPD,ff4tv68,t3_erm3ja,1579572325.0,"I can kinda relate. My only friend is my girlfriend (I wouldn’t change that for the world either, she’s my best friend!). I pushed all my friends away because they were either really bad Influences on me, or because they were bad for my relationship. I can honestly say I haven’t been happier."
BPD,fewacna,t3_eqp620,1579407507.0,I would not deal with that in a million years personally. I’m very anti drugs though. I would talk to her about how it really makes you feel and maybe explain the dangers of those two drugs.
bipolar,feiz0qy,t1_feioxjr,1579151236.0,"That’s not wrong at all. BPD is commonly mistaken for BP due to the mood cycling. The primary difference is that BPD is feeling multiple moods within one day or “rapid cycling”. BP is feeling different moods over an extended period of time, usually a few weeks of depression then a few weeks of mania and so on. I’m not saying BP can’t have rapid cycling I’m just saying that BPD shouldn’t be ruled out by any means."
BPD,feethjs,t3_eoppea,1579040865.0,"I understand what you’re feeling. Even though I don’t want to admit it, I’m super clingy of my girlfriend. I double text all the time if she’s away too long, and I’m so very grateful she doesn’t mind. I know I can be a pain in her ass but I know she loves me and it’s great. I’ve always been super clingy and this was something me and my woman have talked about in the past and we were both okay with it for the most part. We’ve also been dating for 5 years though so this has all been established for a long time. I would just talk to your SO and be honest with him and tell him how much you love seeing his texts pop up on your screen. Also please don’t drink or cut yourself (or other things similar to those two). You’re stronger than that, I’ve never met you and I know that. You got this! Good luck :)"
BPD,fee02op,t3_eomxv8,1579023523.0,"I feel like I kinda relate to him. When I’m with my girl I want ALLL of her attention but I feel bad asking for it because that is needy and overbearing, so I sit there in silence, suffering. I wouldn’t confront him directly about this, instead I would ask him if anything has been bothering him lately and let him bring it up first. When you talk about it try to talk with empathy and not anger. Once he is calm then you guys will be able to come up with a solution that fits both of your needs for the future. I hope this helps!"
bipolar,fed8yfr,t3_eobnvz,1579004110.0,"Marijuana can induce mania and psychosis in people with BP. This happened to my SO a month or so ago when she was drugged by a family member. Smoking marijuana in general is a bad idea but it’s especially bad if you have a mental disorder. There’s reports of it even causing mania in people with BPD. Since the THC has been out of her body she has seemed so much better, and our relationship has so much more trust. I wish you luck!"
BPD,febdlo7,t3_eoc4ry,1578957732.0,This kindve happened to me and my woman. We have been dating for almost 5 years now. It hasn’t always been smooth but it’s been the best thing in my life. Years ago we had a big fight and we broke up and stopped talking “permanently”. 3 months later I wrote her a very long paragraph about how much I missed her (even though she was with someone else at the time to make me jealous) and later that night we told eachother that we loved eachother. We’ve been together ever since stronger than ever and I know that I want to marry her.
relationship_advice,fe9nscd,t3_eo513n,1578939840.0,"That is ridiculous, there is definitely something there he doesn’t want you to see. I’d sit him down and try to have a calm conversation about it and try to get him to come clean. If he does then it’s up to you whether or not he deserves another chance, but if he tries to hold onto the lie I’d personally end it. Honesty is the base for any good relationship, good luck!"
relationship_advice,fe2xme2,t3_enj6qi,1578844038.0,"You should leave her, you even said that if she hadn’t been raped that she would still be cheating on you. Let someone else comfort her, you’re just going to drag yourself down if you stick around. Sorry that this all happened to you."

bipolar,fdof60a,t3_emfoil,1578603947.0,"There is no “manning up” in this situation. You should go see a professional for help. You’re rapid cycling. If it’s common that you have these mood swings like this, you might not be bipolar, you may have borderline personality disorder. Either way, I’d definitely go talk to a medical professional. I wish you the best of luck."
BPD,fdilqvu,t1_fdiln3n,1578445727.0,I love you too ❤️
BPD,fdh5p4g,t3_eld6ft,1578415934.0,"I struggled with empathy for almost all of my life until last year. I went through some really bad stuff that broke me down and made me feel miserable, and ever since that experience I feel like I’ve been so much more empathetic. I’ve realized that just because I don’t think a situation that someone else is in is too bad, they might think it’s the worst thing in the world. Also, unrelated, there’s scientific studies showing that pretending to be empathetic will eventually lead to you learning actual empathy and it eventually becomes a habit."
