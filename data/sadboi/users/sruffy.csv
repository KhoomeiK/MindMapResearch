history,fpt42nb,t3_gey5d8,1588884506.0,"For me we learned about our country (USA) and pretty much did the general history of other continents without going in too deep. Europe was learned about more than say Asia or Africa. We learned about influential ancient civilizations such as Mali, Japan, Inca, Aztecs but that was it. So most learning about history comes from out of school reasources on the spare time of most (unless you are a history major). This basically means the countries that will be studied the most are those who have had the most impact on global situations. Germany, UK, France, Russia, USA, China, Japan are all examples for countries that you hear most about while Argentina is a relativly new country and has had much smaller impact on global politics and situations bar a few wars here and there. That doesn't mean it's history is boring or less important but rather it draws less interest to the masses of people who enjoy the bigger events in history. I'm sure Argentina has a rich history but it is much less interesting to other people since it's impact is much less in the wider sense of things."
