While students may be able to hit pause on their education (and that is certainly not true in all or even most cases), Penn has hundred of people working for them in the dining halls, housekeepers, etc. and keeping those people employed without the tuition income would be a huge blow. And then there is the local economy that is built around Penn and Drexel - hotels from visitors to campus, restaurants, the food trucks.
