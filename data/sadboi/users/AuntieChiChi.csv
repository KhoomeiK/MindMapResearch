Not that you asked but... Here's My story:
My husband and I are friends with my ex husband (my son's Father). My ex and I divorced amicably and my current husband was a friend of both of ours. A few years after our divorce and my remarriage, my ex needed a place to stay (after a hurricane, there were extenuating circumstances) and my current husband asked if my ex could live with us. He said that he couldn't let my son's father become homeless when we had the means to help (we ahead have my husband's brother living here). My ex moved in and has been living here 2 years. It's actually great. This is my our family and I love it. It blows folks' minds though that we can be grown ups about all this."

I'm immunocompromised so it's still recommended that I stay home as much as I can-- which is shitty.

Drugs,fncknrv,t3_g0ky4z,1586839202.0,"Oh man. I'm so so sorry. I know nothing I say will help or fix anything. But I am feeling for you.

 That was the news I always prepared to hear about my sister. She struggled with addiction for years and it definitely strained our relationship. Sadly, I got a different call at the end of February. She was murdered, and it was not related in any way to her drug use or anything. It fucking hurts. No matter how it happens, when it's unexpected, sudden, and out of order from the way things should be.... It's awful.

I don't regret the space that had been between us though i wish it had been different. I know we both knew why that space was there. The boundaries were healthy ones and we were taking our time rebuilding our relationship. I wish we'd been further along in that process but I'm happy we were on good terms. 

I miss her fiercely. It's like standing in the water at the beach. At first, it's like getting pounded by the big waves-- knocked over and pulled under. And as time passes, the waves calm down and stop knocking me over or pulling me under so much. And with more time, it gets calmer and calmer. But every now and then, a big wave will show up and knock me down. That's the image that works for me in terms of grief.

Focus on the good, try not to go down the coulda, shoulda, woulda rabbit hole--is a crappy place. Allow the sad and allow yourself to reach out and let others sit with you. Find the people you can just be sad around and they don't have to DO anything. Just be nearby. I hope you have that and find some sort of peace."

I can maybe see postponing telling him about it but going ahead with a funeral? What in the actual fuck is wrong with you? If this honeymoon was longer than a couple days, then you should have given him the option to come home and cut it short. What a dick move. You would have just ruined our relationship if I was your brother. And all your friends and family that went along with this knowingly are also complete douchebags for letting that happen. I have never been so convinced of whether someone was an asshole on this sub as I am convinced right now that you are one. Wow."
reactivedogs,fnafhsa,t3_g0jc5b,1586796591.0,"My dog is 7. We've done all the work for years (read the things, watched the things, hired the people, did the work) and my dog is as dog/other living creature reactive as he ever was, though he can recover faster and sometimes we can act almost normal when were out but most of the time, he's a mess.

 Everything else training wise is great. He walks in a loose leash (no pulling, stays by my side)... Until/unless we see another dog. He sits, stays, high fives, shakes, down, wave, crawl, and catch. Unless there's another dog around.  He has some issues that we know contribute to his anxiety and craziness but it doesn't change the fact that he is super high maintenance and has to be managed constantly.

 This is as good as he gets and it's a huge improvement, and I love him and am proud of him, but we will never ever have ""normal"". We can't do normal walks outside, we can't go to the dog park, and he can't go to doggie daycare or be boarded anywhere, ever. It is what it is and I will love him until he dies. 

But I will never ever own a dog again. He has ruined it for me and my husband (he wasn't a dog person before and he still isn't). He's a huge liability and it's stressful.  Like I said, I love him. And I love your post-- it is ok to have a dog like this, even if you do everything ""right"". Sometimes that's how things go.

My vet friend once told me, ""Auntiechichi, you're a counselor. You know how some people, no matter how much therapy and/or medication they receive, they're just a little crazy forever? Well, dogs are like that too. Just treat your dog like you would a client who is as good as they get and just need management forever"". It was a hard thing to hear but also the most helpful. I stopped striving for Goal that was unattainable and settled in where we are at. It's less stressful now than it used to be but still a lot of work."

He's definitely the asshole. Cosmetics shouldn't matter, you're right. His reasoning for breaking up with you sucks too.

It's a significant part of your survivor story and for you to leave that out kind of sucks too.

As a therapist, I try to let my courts know that I don't need to know every detail of your life since we last saw each other but I've learned that come people really want that part. They like telling their day to day story and for some, that's how we build our relationship. Remembering details session to session helps too but you are right - coming to therapy with something to work on is helpful"
Professors,fin0hsm,t3_f8owjb,1582552626.0,"I wish more colleges and universities would back off from athletic spending. I work for a community college-turned state college.

 Over the last 5 years, they've increased athletic spending (building new facilities, hiring an athletic director < that makes waaaay more than other similar positions in academics>, built *dorms*, and increased our sports offerings including starting a cheerleader Squad) yet we literally have a condemned building on the original campus (there are 4 campuses, 2 bigger ones <the original and the new ""fancy"" one> and 2 smaller satellite campuses), several big problems with several of the other buildings, missing out underfunded academic services for students, and can't keep certain faculty positions staffed because we pay such crap..... But we need Athletics?? Im saying no.

 The community doesn't need this either-there is a HUGE University with tons of sports within an hour drive of us. I would honestly be happy seeing sports go away. I know they can be an avenue into school for some kids with scholarships but there are better ways to find education than that."

But it's unethical according to all the professional therapy standards for at least a few years, or for forever (depends on the ethical standards the person's licensure adheres to)"

foraging,fhdcdp8,t1_fhcx8ev,1581482330.0,"Really? I have several of these in the woods near my house. The kids were excited to try them even though I warned them--their faces were great. We made lemonade style orange juice with them but they still didn't like it. 
Treating it like a key lime might work... I'm curious now."
