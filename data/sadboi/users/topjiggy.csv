Parakeets,fp2c25a,t3_gavkzc,1588259120.0,"Singing or reading to them will help, as will sitting outside their cage daily and interacting without trying to touch them. Make sure you talk to them in a very calming, comforting tone of voice. Let them get comfortable with your presence. 

I have one parakeet and it probably took 2-4 months before she was comfortable enough to perch on my finger. I‚Äôve had her for about 8 months now and she‚Äôs still not completely comfortable, but she‚Äôs made great progress. Birds are very anxious little creatures and they‚Äôll need time and consistency from you to form a bond. 

Good luck!"
