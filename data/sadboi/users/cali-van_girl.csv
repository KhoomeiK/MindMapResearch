I own over 11,000 dollar because I got sexually assaulted and ended getting diagnosed with PTSD. Or 1 ER visit to report the guy. But they just sent me home after so I had to go back to check into the psych ward. Spent about a week there. Then a few months of outpatient with the final diagnosis of MMD, that I've had since I was 13, and PTSD from the assault. I have to fill out a claims form but I don't know the guy's name. So they wouldn't accept it. Now I have to get another one and just sign it. Even though I already did it?

From ages 13 - 19 because of my mental health, if I didn't have insurance, it would've been cheaper to bury after a suicide attempt.

In fact, I was a micro preemie at birth. So if my parents didn't have insurance, my immediate death after birth, (because my heart stopped 3 times and my lungs didn't function off machines) would have been cheaper than my life at 20."

I checked myself 4 times in the psych ward. 4 months at a max lock residential treatment facility for teens. So if you want more day to day on that?
