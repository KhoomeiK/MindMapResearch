SuicideWatch,f74s4tp,t1_f6p7a75,1573407214.0,I loved sleeping too but now the dreams I get just hurt too much. My girlfriend just broke up with me and I see her in my dreams and it hurts so much because in my dreams it‚Äôs like she loves me and cares about me but when I wake up I realize it‚Äôs all fake. I also see my mom who passed away when I was a child which hurts the most. Every night I hope I don‚Äôt wake up in the morning.

EscapefromTarkov,f6ohy8r,t1_f6oh6cn,1573018546.0,Ok I changed it to look like your settings I‚Äôll see if it makes any impact on stutters
EscapefromTarkov,f6ogiko,t1_f6ogfmi,1573017061.0,Is there anyway you could post a screenshot of your virtual memory settings?
EscapefromTarkov,f6oddnk,t1_f6o5l44,1573014165.0,Also I can‚Äôt change the virtual memory because my game is installed on a sad so there‚Äôs no page file
EscapefromTarkov,f6o5ram,t1_f6o5l44,1573008382.0,"I found something strange, I get smoother fps while playing in borderless windowed, for example, when I use a scope like the Valday 1x/6x in fullscreen my fps drops to 30 while aiming the scope but when I put it on borderless windowed I get no fps drop or barely any at all. Maybe you could try it on your setup?"
EscapefromTarkov,f6o35fh,t1_f6nvnku,1573006573.0,Was there any other settings you messed with? I‚Äôm trying to fix the stutters in my game

Seek out whats bothing you and grab that problem by the nuts. You have to sort out what‚Äôs causing you so much pain. At this point in time, however, you‚Äôre holding onto your mistakes of the past. Give it up and pursue greater things, QUEEN."
