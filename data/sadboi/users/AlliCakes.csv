AmItheAsshole,fn0fhly,t3_fydqux,1586540982.0,"NTA - As a female, I can go MAX three days without a shower, and even then I feel grungy and disgusting. I know with the quarantine, it's easy to fall into the habit of just laying around in your jammies all the time, but you have to keep up with your hygiene. I may skip a shower for a day, but I at least wash my face, brush my teeth, and put on clean clothes when I wake up.

I also understand the excitement of new video games, I will wake up and play The Sims from 10am to 5pm sometimes on my days off. But I usually take a break for a shower sometime during the day. And it's not like she has to do anything special afterwards, like hair styling and makeup. (Although, I've found that doing those things anyway makes things feel more normal and it's easier to keep up with my routine so it's not a shock when things go back to normal.) 

This behavior is just lazy, and if it's so easy for her to neglect her own hygiene, that kind of sends up a red flag for what she could neglect in the future.

Also, if my SO was working and I was staying home, I'd be showered and cute with the chores done by the time he got home from work. Hell, we both work full-time jobs, and I do this when I have a day off and he works. I would never want him to come home from work to a dirty girlfriend and a dirty house after a day at work. And he does the same for me. And we both find plenty of time to binge play our favorite video games."

I went to Big Cat Rescue with a veterinary charity that my mom and stepdad volunteer for and got a private tour of the facilities by Carole Baskins. She's a sweet woman, and they have A LOT of land. The cats are in what you see as a small space because the toys and food are there to attract them to the front so you can see them. They actually have tons of room to roam. And the most impressive thing I saw were these HUGE refrigerated buildings full of fresh meat for the cats. They're a legit rescue, otherwise my stepdad wouldn't have volunteered his services.

AskReddit,flaul3w,t3_fno02p,1584991432.0,"This happened a few years ago. I went to a bar with some friends and it was freezing outside. We went to open the door and go in, and we were told that the inside was reserved for a private party, but we could hang out in their outdoor seating. More people showed up, and we were all generally upset about the situation. Then one of the bartenders let it slip that Derek Jeter was throwing a party inside. Before I go any further, I will admit that at the time I had a very small understanding of what Derek Jeter looks like.

So we're all standing outside, drinking, and this car rolls up to the valet. A guy in sweats gets out and heads for the door, and they greet him very warmly. I'm thinking to myself who the hell is this scrub getting in? So of course I have to speak my thoughts because I have no filter. I say very loudly and in the direction of this person, ""Look at this fuckin bum they're letting in!"" He smiled at me and went inside.

I looked at my friends and they were in shock. I didn't understand why, I say shit like that all the time. They ask if I know who I just yelled at, and I say yeah some dumb guy. Nope. It was Derek Jeter. 

And that's how I know what he looks like.
