Why cannot CFA can give the option to people to defer or refund ? Why because its has huge effect in US and chinese market why everyone has to postponed till December i want to give exam i can give exam with whole suit on I wanted this level 2 to done with it. Now it will be more difficult for people to clear this exam ..

First more people gonna give this exam .plus those people who have cleared l1 in decemeber that wanted more time for l2 now can give in December plus results gonna be in jan end or feb starting ..if i clear I only have 4 months to crack l3 with so many changes and a beast of essay type disappoint with CFA could have waited till march end for the decision .. I think its because of so many messages from candidates all over the world that CFA institute panicked."
CFA,fkfj5bw,t3_fi3bvp,1584135556.0,"I urged not to get this much panic cause exam is still has months to go and in the meantime just prepare as if the exam will be conducted in June like every time. I  do know CFAI will not risk candidates they would be releasing the statement of exams date at the mid of April or in the first week I  suppose. I think the people forcing for postponed or even delay to next year are only those people who didn't do any study yet and waiting for some magic thing to happen. 

If you guys cannot give exams just defer it and let the serious candidates give the exams this year. It would be better as the number of candidates decreases this year already there are tons of people wanted to pursue this course making it oversupply and losing the credibility once it had."
