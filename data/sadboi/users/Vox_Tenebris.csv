Seaofthieves,flywh0h,t3_frmso4,1585610510.0,The PVP aspect is a part of the game it was made that way straight from the beginning. When I do play sometimes solo or with a friend we're very careful and keep a watch out for others. We know that the more loot we carry the more likely we are to lose it so it's just a balance of how much loot you want to gather before selling it in and how much you want to carry. It can be annoying when someone chases you across the entire map but on the other hand hand if you can Escape or Juke them and get the treasure to a vendor even while they're chasing you it feels really awesome.

The new league mechanic itself kind of sounds like bestiary 2.0 but with more emphasis on bosses sounds like it could be fun and less system stressing unlike blight.

pathofexile,f7r2t53,t1_f7r1o67,1573973824.0,"Partly because it looks like it will take increased capabilities, by the time it releases will probably have Xbox 4 and PlayStation 5 which would probably play it quite well but will they try to launch add it to the current systems? I'm not sure if the standard Xbox one could even play Path of Exile 2 because it doesn't play Path of Exile very well at all, the Xbox One X play it much smoother though and could probably do it. As I said before it seems obvious but there are details I would like to know but I suppose I'll have to wait for that."
pathofexile,f7qztzj,t1_f7qvwhk,1573972355.0,LOL got downvoted I guess no one likes when the the console's get mentioned
pathofexile,f7qyf9i,t1_f7ou7hc,1573971670.0,I don't know about the PlayStation but if you have an Xbox One X it plays pretty well especially compared to how a normal Xbox plays it feels similar to the PC version. Controls are amazing definitely made from the ground up for the console though there's a couple things that you can do on the PC that aren't quite allowable with a joystick versus a mouse. Item management pretty much plays like the PC version there is a bit less options when it comes to sorting. And of course the PC version is going to be superior but if you prefer playing with controllers then the console version is going to be the one to play with because there is no controller support at all on the PC. As for the updates PC updates on Friday in the US and then the following Monday after the weekend the console version releases at least on Xbox. They do this because the PC version typically has a lot of bugs when it first launches and they can get out the patches really quick while Microsoft requires you to go through certification of which they don't do on the weekends. We get the fixed up version on Monday with all of The Weeknd patches built-in.
pathofexile,f7qxlki,t1_f7qxbu9,1573971275.0,The more people that are playing on console so like if the league is well-liked then the more adjusted the economy will be but like in the current league of blight there's been so few players that the economy is just been jacked up almost feels like when the game first came out and no one knew what the value of anything was. I'm still done decent between random drops and buying and selling where I could but not as well as other leagues when there was more players so it just depends how well people are going to enjoy that League for how smooth the market will run
pathofexile,f7qxbu9,t3_dxbjxu,1573971150.0,I have an Xbox One X and I quite enjoy playing Path of Exile on it 2000 hours so far even though I did start out with a normal Xbox One at first and there was a serious improvement with a 1X. My biggest problem is I'm just not a fan of mouse and keyboard but I think it plays real well occasionally it will lag and so like the light League has been terribly difficult because there's just too much stuff happening. And I got really close to beating Uber Elder but (and this could be due to my 8 megabit internet) I kept having small half a second lag spikes every little bit and I couldn't beat him because of it. Before the blight League it played really well otherwise. The PC is better because it's a PC but you cannot play a controller on the PC it is not made that way. I have tried.
pathofexile,f7qvwhk,t3_dwtnsj,1573970482.0,My only thing that I want to know is 4.0 or Path of Exile 2 going to be also on consoles? I mean I would assume it is but I just wish for a clarification...
playatlas,f5s7ahu,t3_doysmv,1572414869.0,Yes I agree especially on Xbox because there's rocks in the harbor of our base that are invisible but only on Xbox not on the PC cuz we have members of both. As a warning the Crescent Harbor on the southernmost Isle of A9 has several invisible Sandbar rock formations. Are PC player Mark them with above water pillars and platforms with a sign warning of it but we still had 16 vessels that we know of Crash and sink in that Harbor
playatlas,f5jy5ln,t3_dl9e0a,1572246571.0,We have some of these rocks in front of our Harbor that can only be seen on the PC I'm on Xbox and I can stand on top of them feeling something odd but cannot see them they are completely invisible. Thankfully the members that are on the PC have built up pillars on the island above the water so I can go around them without hitting them but they absolutely do not appear even while being close enough to touch or stand on at least for the Xbox. And so far we've had 15 wrecks in that Harbor because of it from other people.
playatlas,f4t0gly,t1_f4spgzd,1571782657.0,"It's definitely a lot more of a With Friends game but if you play in PVE I found a lot of friendly people.

Even though I'm part of a five-man company most of our stuff is 2 sectors to the north and I'm usually down there by myself farming iron. It's fun to listen and I have bought a bear from one of the Breeders and transported on my boat back to the base. If you need people to play with you can look for people wanting to make companies on the official Atlas Discord, maybe in Reddit, and maybe some Xbox clubs. You can put cannons on your ship and buy NPCs from the freeport's and have them on the Cannons so you can fight ships of the Damned though it can be difficult because the AI is not entirely super smart lol"

Water barrel Works real well because it rains eventually and doesn't run out easily. I just don't like having to go out and kill land animals and fish and then cook their meat just so I can Stave off dying it's like extra time without a whole lot of benefit at least for me. I'm sure that when we plan to do the dungeons in the future I will be very reversed on that opinion but as of now since I'm sitting right next to a base with a bed it's not a big issue.

I have 1800 hours in Path of Exile and I've spent a little over a hundred. Path of Exile is a free-to-play game that I think has the Cosmetic microtransaction game down to a pat and other free-to-play Developers should really go look that closely because they're Reddit is nothing but praise. Though a bit of the difference between the two is how the Developers from GGG handle their community in regards to comments, road maps, and doing their absolute best in fixing the variety of bugs and server issues in a very timely manner.

apexlegends,ewuvjzx,t3_cq3es7,1565792690.0,I was kind of hoping you would get the skins from like you have to win a solo game with that Legend to unlock the skin which would be a challenge
Stormlight_Archive,ewfhsua,t3_cnuon0,1565361147.0,I got some form of bipolar or maybe just depression now but The Stormlight Archive particularly has been quite amazing in a very similar manner so I completely agree with you. Mistborn was nice too with the depression some of the characters dealt with. I also really like Shallan some of the things she goes through are very relatable it's a bit eerie.
pathofexile,ew1c2fm,t1_ew1bkyh,1565020082.0,"I usually sort stuff out before it goes to standard so then it's much easier or to sort out once it's there and I've already spent like 8 hours sorting out like four leagues worth of stuff. I like the standard not so much because I want to play it but because it's more like a museum the past leagues I try to keep one of everything like the best statted uniques and put all the currency, cards, fragments and essence's together. Waiting for a new league just started kind of gives you something to do and look over your past stuff LOL"
Stormlight_Archive,ew1a8l5,t1_ew193gg,1565018879.0,I doubt that George is like stalled out on making his series but Brandon is pumping out so many books he doesn't even have time for them all. Brandon says he's got to stop with some of the ideas he comes up with because he would never finish the cosmere otherwise and yet he still takes breaks from fantasy and sometimes writes interesting side books or even trilogies like Legion which I highly recommend reading.
Stormlight_Archive,ew18r1c,t1_ew18h7p,1565017874.0,It says he was born December 13th 1975 so he's 44 years old. I mean technically he could probably make the rest of the cosmere before he passes on but that chance always goes up the older you get
pathofexile,ew15c47,t3_cm8yo4,1565015529.0,Yeah I would agree with the above comments filling in the currency slot would be the best. Then when you go to standard and look at all the leftover currency from all the leagues the mirror slot is always filled with at least one and that would be freaking awesome.
Stormlight_Archive,ew14h8l,t1_ew0ovtt,1565014928.0,"For the entire cosmere he's got a rough plan of like 40 books or something of which he has already made a bunch of but still a lot more to go. Mistborn still got to get one more book for era 2 then is era 3 Series and then the final cosmere series which will be era 4 mistborn. In between all of that there's the other seven books of Stormlight, the Dragonsteel series, a sequel to elantris and warbreaker, and probably a few other books I can't even think of or he hasn't named. I just hope he finishes the cosmere before he passes on or finds a good heir."
Stormlight_Archive,evqct17,t3_ckm4xq,1564690758.0,Well this is how I'm imagining him from now on while I'm reading the books good job!
Stormlight_Archive,evlqnzz,t3_ck5ill,1564597968.0,I really enjoyed the dragons of Pern series and the sword of truth series even though it gets a bit preachy about 3/4 in on the evils of religion but the characters are really enjoyable. Also enjoy the HALO novels expanding that lovely sci-fi universe.
bipolar,evcf0fn,t3_cj5jn4,1564413692.0,"Last Monday suddenly it just snapped in place and I've been exercising and eating right all week and feel amazing. I have like this overwhelming motivation to go on a long brisk walk twice a day, I feel like every muscle burn makes me super powered I don't think I'm having any elevated mood levels but it's been a great week so far. Also my depression seems to be pushed into a small little corner like a dimly Blinking Star which is excellent  because it controlled nearly 80% of my mind the day before. I don't know if I'm blind I'm going through just random phase or not but I'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth too long and enjoy this absolutely amazing motivation."
Stormlight_Archive,evce993,t3_cj315k,1564413184.0,I completely stay off the Reddit until I'm done with each book as it comes out.
ffxiv,euth53b,t3_ch8rfg,1564025665.0,I still don't remember this guy at all like unfortunately it didn't have the emotional impact they were going for it because I was like who the heck is this guy?
ffxiv,esfomvc,t1_esea8o9,1561931254.0,When I was in the great Woodforest it was a constant shout match of why thancred sucks or doesn't suck for more than an hour and it wasn't entirely polite
ffxiv,es6qx6a,t3_c60qz3,1561655372.0,Probably play some Age of Empires 2 that I bought from the Steam Sale
ffxiv,ero1vct,t1_efz41dj,1561066258.0,It says they're skilled in Metallurgy and Mining so they should get a special Iron Giant
pathofexile,eqec2b5,t3_by7qp4,1560001980.0,I really want guilds on the console because this is a really good idea
bipolar,eqa6o6y,t3_bxpoqs,1559926395.0,I deal with manic depression and I don't take any medication I just learned to suppress the ever-living hell out of everything to the point that I do it subconsciously. This method has afforded me a normality that lets me at least look normal to everyone else but at the cost of my ever failing memory and bad days that increase over time leading to a catastrophic event of which we've had one that lasted 8 months and after the last three years is likely to lead to another soon.
BattlefieldV,eppytif,t3_bvbn67,1559395402.0,They're probably removed it so they could build up hype and then give it back also they would seem like really good Developers for listening.
apexlegends,eoholec,t1_eohip5c,1558587439.0,I mean people say the game's dead but as long as you have 64 people then you can have a full game so even if 50 million people ain't playing this game anymore the game is still plenty alive. There's never any finding people to play with issues.
