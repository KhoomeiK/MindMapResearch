falloutnewvegas,fqxl1l6,t3_glfs6f,1589733946.0,"The NCR are good if you want a good ending where for the most part everyone's satisfied even the Khans. You can only do that if you: sort out the problem with the Kings, get the followers to help during the second battle of Hoover dam, get the Brotherhood Chapter to work with the NCR. There will be order, there will be a government, but you'll crush the idea of the citizens of New Vegas of ever being independent and not paying heavy taxes.

The legion is only good as a military, but as a government they'll fail. All they truly know is how to conquer but once they run out of opponents, the legion will devour itself. Not to mention  there aren't any worthy successors to Caesar. And do you really want people to be turned into slaves? Actual slaves, not just metaphorically.

Mr House is sort of the ""middle ground"", he wants to be in charge and everyone can do what ever they want in private in return. He doesn't care, and doesn't want or wish to meddle unless it interferes with his plans to restore Vegas to its glory days and beyond.

I agree with your point about playing it first then deciding on the final verdict. But I still think one has the right to criticize what they saw in the leaks and discuss it. Respectfully of course, without harassing people who disagree with them.

I hope no one misinterprets what I wrote here, my point is the  leak was not like your average leak where some photos or screenshots get leaked. This was big. And if it wasn't true, Naughty Dog (the developers) could have easily said that it was some old parts that they scraped or something but they didn't. You'll get what I mean when you see the actual thing.

The NCR is essentially a post apocalyptic USA, they're better than the Enclave that's for certain. To me they have the closest thing to a good ending. If you play your cards right, virtually every minor faction will be somewhat content. The Followers, The Brotherhood of Steel, The Khans, the Kings. They establish the rule of law, provide security and more. The problem however, is that the NCR suffers from corruption among the elites. The people with money have senators back in California in their pockets, a bit similar to how money can influence politics in the US. Furthermore, heavy taxation makes life difficult. People in Goodsprings start leaving because of that if you get the NCR ending. Problem is the NCR is also greedy with their expansionist policy sacrificing many of its own sons and daughters in the process plus pissing off the people who don't want to join them. This is one way to make enemies, Powder Gangers were sort of pissed because of that even though they're essentially bandits. Not to mention the NCR was incompetent until the Courier shows up and gets involved.

The legion is morally the bad guy, while the NCR is morally the good guy. The legion is hard to accept because they enslave people and follow a very archaic world view, and their stance against technology and modern medicine is somewhat retarded and hypocritical in the case of Caesar. The guy has an AutoDock in his tent, yet isn't too fond of advanced technology or medicine. He dies, Lanius takes over which is a mindless butcher thirsty for blood. If he takes over pretty much everyone is crucified, even the Followers but if Caesar lives he spares them out of some nostalgia from his time with them in the past. Women to them are subhumans and nothing more than breeders and cum buckets. Suffice to say they are pretty shitty people who worship a fraud who posses as a demi-god. So what's good about them you ask? Order, discipline, focus, direction, loyalty. These people infiltrated the NCR, took over camps, bombed a camp with nuclear waste, bleed the NCR dry. You have to give them credit, for their military genius. They also keep their trade routes safe because Raiders fear them whereas the same cannot be said about the NCR. But that's where it ends, they'r e good as machines of war but nothing beyond that. 

Yes Man, well New Vegas stays independent so no NCR or Legion. Problem is it becomes anarchic but slowly goes back to being a little more orderly IF you upgraded the Securatrons. This ending is highly debatable.

Mr House, pretty much the same thing with a slight difference. Mr House maintains order, all opposition is crushed and Securatrons are spread all over the m Mojave to make sure things stay that way. He doesn't care how people go on about their lives but he cares about being the Autocratic ruler of New Vegas. Furthermore, he wishes to build spaceships to search for life on other planets, unpolluted by war from a bygone era. The problem is that if you don't comply to what ever it is he wants, he'll kill you plain and simple. Take the Kings for example, if you sort things between them with the NCR, he'll wipe them out seeing them as ""lying in bed with a foreign enemy"", if not he'll think they're loyal to Vegas and reward them by giving them free reign in Freeside.
