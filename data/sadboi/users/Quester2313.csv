Dreams,f4j1ken,t3_dkr1vc,1571611973.0,"Some thoughts on your dream meaning. 

School- A place we experience social structures or our placing within social structures. 

The end of a line- last place, not accepted, coming last, not accepted within social structure? 

Connotation of a Friend- someone we can trust. Moving towards the friend for comfort of some kind but not receiving it.
Friend is partaking in a self harm activity i.e smoking. To blow smoke in someone’s face can represent disrespect or disregard for someone else’s wellbeing. 

Smoke- can be known to veil things, to hide things, the expression smoke and mirrors. 

Some questions

Do yous have feelings of inadequacy? Do you feel like people are withholding things from you? For example, are the withholding acceptance? Or it could simply be a fear of those things.

Also where you upset by the friend smoking or by the act of them blowing smoke in your face?"

AskAstrologers,f0208kg,t1_ezx0241,1568321340.0,"No problem at all. I too can struggle with procrastination. I recently read a book called, The Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday and it has really gave me a good kick up the backside to stop procrastinating and pursue my passions. 
If you have a chance you should give it a listen or read. It may help you with the procrastination especially towards those things that are your passions and I can imagine you have quite a lot of intense passions with Pluto in the 5th house.

Also, for someone so young, it’s nice to see  that you are self aware and reflective, that will get you far. 

As far as the anxiety goes have you ever gave thought to meditation? I’m quite an anxious person myself, and spent the whole of my twenties letting anxiety overcome me. However, I find with meditation that I have so much more control over how I react and rationalise things. If it interests you there is a wonderful app called Insight Timer, it is free and has mediations for all things and for all levels. 

I’m trying to slowly introduce my daughter to it to help with her anxieties but as she is only 9 she doesn’t quite understand it all, but it good to introduce some coping mechanisms young. 

Best of luck ❤️

Edit: oh another brilliant book for any creative type prone to procrastinate is The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield. Some of his views don’t align with mine but he cuts right to the core of why we procrastinate and how to overcome it."

CPTSD,ez47sud,t1_ez46zrs,1567682541.0,"No problem, it’s very hard. I totally understand all of the anger. I was emotionally abused by my mother for years, while my sister was placed on a pedestal. 

It took me to get to 32 before I finally cracked and told her how what she had done had impacted me greatly (denial on her part has always been strong). I honestly believe the if I hadn’t said anything I would have cracked up. I was terrified to confront my abuser but I can honestly say that since speaking my mind, I feel like a weight has been lifted, as if somehow I made a breakthrough. 

I think often victims of abuse have been taught to suffer in silence and somehow breaking through that silence has liberated me. I’m not saying I’m completely healed, far from it. But, I have took control of the situation for the first time and it helps. 

I have went off on a tangent, but wanted you to know that expressing your pain and anger, even on here is a good thing. Much better than bottling it up."
CPTSD,ez46aqt,t3_czz9a8,1567681676.0,"You have been through a lot of violence and abuse. I believe that is reason enough to have CPTSD. 

I hope that you are able to get the proper help and I’m sorry to read of all the trauma you have went through. I never understand why people would treat their children like this, children are precious and should be treated with respect and love.

Best of luck in finding some healing, it’s a long road but if you keep trying to work on your internal pain you will have a breakthrough. 

Until you find the proper avenues to help would you ever consider things like yoga and mediation? I’m not saying this will provide all the help, but it certainly has helped me to deal with the emotions that occur due to my childhood abuses.

Take care and all the best."
