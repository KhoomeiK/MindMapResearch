NYKnicks,fivownu,t1_fivo18i,1582764824.0,Yeah I agree. I think his stats on post ups are probably bad. But how's he going to improve if he doesn't get the chance?
NYKnicks,fiuf73l,t3_f9x6m3,1582740247.0,This makes me sad. Hire the best shooting coach money can buy. To not have an offical shooting coach seems crazy. Does anybody know how common this is for a team? I always just imagined a shooting coach was a necessity

Knox had another solid game, i think he fits a lot better in this role vs last year when we asked him to create off the dribble. RJ looks like he belongs. Randle had 25 11 and 6 his first game, hopefully we'll see more of that. Payton hasn't looked bad. I think with some more time playing together this team is going to look a lot better"
