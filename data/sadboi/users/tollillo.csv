LadiesofScience,fmpduqo,t3_fwi1rn,1586279075.0,"There are a couple of things that have bugged me during my career as a scientist. Mind you, I work in biology so the majority of people are women, but collaborate heavily with male-dominated groups from the maths department.

In my lab, we have no rota for cleaning duties. In principle, this is fine, we are not very big and we don't need tidying up very often. However, this turns into men helping the women in the lab with stuff or us having to chase guys to give us a hand. It's everyone's job!!! Make sure everyone has an active role, maybe assignig chores to each person? 

When there are pub outings, sometimes all the guys decide between themselves that they are going and forget to ask everyone else, to then act surprised when we don't join because we made other plans. If it's a group activity, make sure everyone gets some form of invitation."
