A good place to start would be a full recurrent loss panel and karyotyping. I want to warn you about the POC genetic testing: you may not get the answers you want/need. Out of my six miscarriages, I only had testing on one and it was completely normal. It‚Äôs been nearly three years and I still don‚Äôt have an answer. Best of luck to you ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Healthyhooha,fne9i62,t3_g14e3w,1586885410.0,It‚Äôs normal to have a few irregular cycles after miscarriage. I agree with the top comment: it seems to be hormonal. Talk to a new doctor and ask to be put on the mini pill!

infertility,fn0posr,t3_fyf46e,1586546382.0,I‚Äôd be hesitant to dismiss the possibility of embryo quality issues. Karyotyping on both you and your partner plus an RPL panel would be a good first step. It‚Äôs best to rule out the obvious things first before moving onto more extensive testing.
PregnancyAfterLoss,fn0oqeu,t3_fyggbe,1586545866.0,I had a constant yeast infection that lasted for my entire pregnancy.

I personally experienced severe pain, similar to early labor with my son. I know some women who only felt minor cramping. 

I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss.

Edit: as for the remains, we gave the hospital the tissue for genetic testing. We had three options: burial, cremation, or give the tissue back to us to dispose of. It‚Äôs completely up to you what you want. There‚Äôs no shame in having a burial."

PregnancyAfterLoss,fl63xiu,t1_fl5saag,1584853645.0,"I‚Äôm sorry, I really know how it feels. Your period may be late (even if you‚Äôre not pregnant) since you just miscarried. Every implantation is different, so it might just be too early on for a positive test."

PregnancyAfterLoss,fl5pxaf,t3_fmrsz5,1584842721.0,Are you temping? Taking your BBT (basal body temperature) is more accurate than OPKs. It‚Äôs normal for your body to take a few cycles before completely regulating itself.

For my husband and I, we‚Äôre simply diagnosed as having unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Like you, I‚Äôve had all the testing and everything has come back normal. It‚Äôs so incredibly frustrating not having an answer.
