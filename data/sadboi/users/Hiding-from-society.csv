Psychosis,fnyrres,t1_fnwkvpj,1587373200.0,"I relate to some of this. I don’t have delusions or severe anxiety or something like that, but I know something is wrong and nobody takes me serious. When I spent ten weeks in the psych ward, the doctor diagnosed me with histrionic and schizoid personality disorder because I often cried in public. I later had therapy with his wife, and she turned everything I said around to fit her husband’s narrative. I once had therapy with another girl at a the same time and I acted very awkwardly, but she praised me as if she expected even less of me. I once suggested to her that I might have Munchhausen’s syndrome because I always try to force myself into some diagnosis criteria because I want to be taken serious so badly (and also I tried to seriously disable myself a couple of times), but she laughed at me and said I just wanted attention because of my HPD.

It just doesn’t fit. Also, doctors always tell me things “you’re not autistic, but ...”
I’m sick of their speculations because I know they ultimately don’t care and just think I’m an attention seeker. 

Also, ADHD (or rather ADD) is something I relate to very much because I experience those symptoms, but I’m scared to bring it up to my current therapist, because I’ve had such bad experiences with suggestion stuff in therapy, being literally screamed at (stop talking bs) or laughed at.

Doctors just like to give me medication and say it’s a passing phase. I’ve been given prescriptions of sertraline, mirtazapine, risperdal, abilify and seroquel (I don’t know if the names are right in English). Not all at the same time though. Now I’m just taking Sertraline because of my depressive episodes.

So yes, when it comes to the labels and diagnoses, I relate to that. I just wish people would take me seriously for once and understand why I want a diagnosis. I get that labels aren’t always good, but I feel like if I had one, I would finally know what I would have to be working on, that I’m being taken seriously, that people believe me, that it’s just an illness that can be treated and not simply my stupid personality, that there are other people out there who experience the same thing and understand ... but in my country at least, diagnoses are frowned upon and it’s very difficult to find a therapist who supports it."

The only thing that‘s scary is when they are very loud and appear out of nowhere and I startle. Sometimes they are so loud that I look around me to make sure it really was inside of my head. I once “heard” my father calling my name and it was a bit scary.

Psychosis,fntdqet,t1_fntcnz0,1587239606.0,"Nice to find someone who can relate! If you find out what it is, can you tell me?

I wouldn’t say I take substance often, the most it gets is drinking once a week. I take anti depressants. My previous therapist tried three anti psychotics with me (but that phenomenon wasn’t happening when I was with her, it was just that I had very bad intrusive thoughts and flight of ideas and stuff). I hated them all and only took them like once. 

I explain it to myself as my brain thinking on while I kind of zone out, then suddenly become aware of the workings of my mind and then that happens? But some thoughts are just very random. Especially the name ones, and the loud ones who have a clearly distinct voice.

It really seems to be related to tiredness/fatigue. Maybe it’s some kind of zoning out ... also I most likely have ADD, not diagnosed but at least things that happen to people with ADD happen to me too. Maybe there’s a connection."

DID,fla0o3x,t3_fne1qf,1584973998.0,"From the perspective of someone who might do this:

I‘ve been suffering from mental issues for years now and one of my biggest issue has become obsessing over diagnoses. I guess the reason for this is being invalidated by family and doctors all the time and feeling like I‘m only worthy of love if I have a diagnosis (has a lot to do with my family history). I am hurting so fucking much all the time and I just wish someone said to me it was okay to feel like this, I wouldn‘t need a “reason” to make my feelings valid ... but no one does. This is why I’m looking for a label. This is why I want to put a name on it. To protect myself. To validate myself. As a result I have self diagnosed me with _absolutely everything_ . I feel like it’s something else every single month and it’s so exhausting, I don’t enjoy it, is an obsession and an addiction I can’t control. I’m researching these disorders all day, find things that add up, other things that don’t, move on to the next disorder ... If I’m very confident about something, I might even bring up the courage to mention it to the therapist I have at the time. Just to be laughed at again. I don’t talk about these things to therapists anymore. It’s just happening in my head. I would never claim to have a disorder if I don’t have a diagnosis. What’s the point? I want a diagnosis to find people I can relate to, that understand me, that won’t judge me. I think people claiming to have disorders they know nothing about are the worst and represent what I hate about myself the most, what I’m so afraid of becoming one day. I’m aware that I probably don’t have any of these disorders. Some things always fit, but that’s just normal. But because I know that, I never talk about these absurd suspicions to anyone, I just post stuff online asking questions about the disorders to learn more, and this is how I think people should handle things. It’s important to care for oneself, but it’s much more important to watch out for other people’s feelings and I would never forgive myself if in my quest to find out what’s wrong with me I hurt other people."

I have 100% control over my normal inner voice, meaning I can make it say whatever in a funny voice. There are also thought voices behind that main one, they sound exactly the same, but I can‘t make them say whatever I want. They just occur, mostly in bed before falling asleep, and say really unexpexted things like “not again”, “no no no no no no”, “you can take them”. They go away immediatly after I notice them, as if I’m not supposed to hear them. And they occur at the same time than my normal inner monologue, they overlap it. Another funny thing is that I will forget what they said, I won’t remember a thing unless I write it down immediately. I don’t remember having these thoughts I just described, I just remember the feeling and that it happened, but the words sound very foreign to me (I just know them because I started writing them down). Then, more rarely, there are these very _loud_ thoughts. They do sound very distinguished from each other. Eg one was definitely a man and another one a teenage voice. Unlike overlapping my inner monologue, they quiet it down. And they react to what I was thinking. I don’t remember in what context, but I was thinking something along the lines of ‘I’m only making it up because I want to be interesting’ and I heard this really loud teenage girl voice sighing very loudly in an annoyed tone in my head.

Work out at home (either downloading work out apps or looking up things on the internet, there’s a lot of things one can do without equipment)

Tidying up rooms or moving around furniture to change the looks while listening to music

Binge watching tutorials on Youtube. If you have a computer, you could learn 3D software of that’s something that interests you; there’s this opel source software called Blender, there are tons of tutorials on Youtube and you could learn to do cool 3D animations. There’s also subreddits on Blender, for example r/blenderhelp

If you like singing, you can listen to lots of karaoke versions on Youtube and sing along

You could go buy tons of jigsaw puzzles (usually people can still go to shopping centers) and do them while listening to music (or not), I find that to be very relaxing.

You can learn to draw, either with pencils or with anything else (I think pencils would be the easiest because normally everyone has them at home).

You could write a story. I’m a writer and I love writing. It gives me 100% of control over what’s going to happen.

hpd,fkwwwdc,t1_fkwvtdq,1584609451.0,"I feel like it‘s as impossible to self diagnose than to be sure one doesn‘t fit certain criterias ... there might be other things that you didn‘t even know could be part of it, or you‘re just thinking of HPD because you read the definition and it resonated with you, which can happen with a lot of disorders and as a result, people try to forcibly fit the criteria because they just need to put a name on what they are going through (at least that‘s what I‘m always doing) ... so no one can say for sure what you have or don‘t have, maybe not even you. It‘s hard to self diagnose a personality disorder since they are basically just extreme traits of something everyone has to an extend.

With that being said, I‘m no expert on HPD, I‘ve just been diagnosed with it; I don‘t even know if it fits, because I got the diagnosis when I was in a psych ward for ten weeks where I behaves like I would never at any other place. For example, I cried a lot in public. But moving on to what I‘m normally like, a lot of what I‘m doing, if not everything, has to do with other people. I want to be thinner than everyone else, I want to have better grades than everyone else, I want to be seen and heard by everyone else ... I‘m constantly competing with everyone else. I feel like there‘s only place for one at the top, and if it‘s not me, this means that nobody cares about me and I‘m meaningless and forgotten. I feel the existencial need to be seen. I don‘t necessarily want the to be the center of attention, I just want to be “important”; the problem with that is that my definition of important is not healthy (for example being thinner than everyone else to the point that they believe I’m anorexic equals important for me). It’s a very weird dynamic. I want people to think about me without worrying about me, because I can’t deal with other people’s emotions. Again, I have no idea if this is HPD, but I would guess so."

Unfortunately I don’t have any experience with these kind of things and we’re very probably not even from the same country, so I can’t give you any valid advice, but this is my input. (Maybe you know any lawyer you can reach out to for legal advice, in real life or on forums like Quora where you can request answers from certain people?) I wish you good luck on this. Take care, be safe."

biid,fknkasj,t3_fjecmu,1584367830.0,"There seems to be a socially accepted line that defines what is gross and what is not. When it comes to BIID, it depends on how you’re affected, I guess. For me the thought of losing a limb as such is “gross”, but if someone told me they felt like their leg or something didn’t belong to them, I wouldn’t be weirded out by it. I wouldn’t think you’re crazy or something if they wanted to get rid of it. But I definitely don’t want to see a video of someone losing a limb, if it’s a fresh wound with blood etc (if it’s healed there’s no problem at all, I simply can’t see blood). I don’t know. When I generally think about someone destroying their eyes in some kind of way, it’s very gross to me to. Extremely gross. Yet, I tried more than once to push a needle into my eyeball (and other things) because I feel like my eyes don’t belong to me ... 

So I think it really depends. Maybe people think it’s gross when they think of the process of losing a body part? Because to me, it is, regardless of whether I’m comfortable with that part or not. Whereas when it comes to movies, they usually don’t show too much, or if they do it’s sensationalised and those who like watching it just like these kind of things. While to those people, it might be gross in another context (such as a story which focused primarily on the loss of a limb rather than on heroic actions)."
BPD,fknjk9b,t3_fjipzz,1584367320.0,"I often see things in the corner of my eyes. Occasionally I think I hear the ringtone of a phone, but I think that’s just because I’m so scared of my phone going off during class ... and, I’m not sure if this falls under hallucinations, but in the evening I sometimes hear a voice in my head. They can be pretty distinct, there was once a man and two days ago, while I was thinking about something I don’t remember, there was a girl voice that sighed in a very annoyed manner. They are not “voices” as in psychosis though, just very loud thoughts that come out of the blue and that I can’t control or predict whatsoever."

DID,fkn8wjb,t3_fjg36m,1584358403.0,"I don’t have DID, but I would never say such a thing. That’s just really disrespectful and hurtful and it’s more than understandable that you would feel betrayed. 

[[[[[[possible trigger: psych ward] I once spent ten weeks in a psych ward and later in the report (is it called like that in english?) the psychiatrist said that I probably didn’t have anything wrong with me, that I “subjectively perceived to be under stress” and often cried hysterically to get attention.]]]]]] 

My next therapist after that, who happened to be his wife, also kept telling me that I was an attention seeker. I was diagnosed with HPD. I don’t know if it’s true, I kind of believe them, but regardless it hurts so much to have one’s experiences invalidated in that form, maybe I really am an attention seeker, but whatever it is I think nobody should ever tell someone that in a way that makes them feel like they’re a burden for existing and wishing to be listened to. I think what most people want is validation. I know that I want that. People either want validation or just want to live in peace. Just remember they are wrong for saying things like that. It’s obvious that you just want to live and be yourselves, this isn’t a provilege, it’s a right, and everyone who makes you feel bad for it is in the wrong."

mentalillness,fkl1svg,t1_fkkz460,1584296645.0,"The only person I can talk to who will understand is my friend, but like I explained I feel pathetic to complain about something she has been through so often. And yes, all you’re saying is true, in the beginning I got all of that out of it; especially since nobody has taken me seriously previously, I felt very validated and like people finally believed I wasn’t doing so well.

However. No, freedom isn’t the only scary thing. The psych ward is full of frustrated teens. I was bullied. Some nurses were a bit ignorant or insensitive (“people who talk about suicide won’t do it”; one nurse even told a girl who said she didn’t remember one night “well maybe you were r___”); etc). There are lots of underweight girls there. Lots of triggers. People look at you weird when you just run away. You always need an excuse to leave the conversation because of a trigger. I learned so many ways to self harm. Etc ..."

BPD,fkkq8eq,t3_fiymrl,1584289645.0,"Same thing. Music def intensifies it. To me, I also have to be in some kind of movement because it makes me so nervous. So maybe in a car or pacing around the table or swinging. When it gets  super intense I start to mimick whatever my inner characters are doing in the daydream, ranging from facial expressions to actually moving around and saying stuff.

blenderhelp,fkkookl,t1_fkkmbq0,1584288699.0,"I gave up on that idea. I wanted to get keyframes so I could move the objects (planes) because they kept going through each other. My animation has 300 frames and the planes are supposed to fly around like flyers in the wind; wouldn’t I need 300 shape keys for that? I wanted to conform to just bake the physics and put a collision on all objects, but my laptop really doesn’t agree with this idea ... it takes an insane amount of time to even just get a cache."
