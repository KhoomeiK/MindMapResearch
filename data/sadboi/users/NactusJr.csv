and let me ask you who is this person you deem worthy to verify and be credited? 

there's no authority. I insist on believing based on data taken and provided by people with his own expertise. you believe in what you see and only what you see. I can't blame you for that.

there would be no fruitful result out of this conversation because you are overly skeptic towards people's work and I do not believe in the idea of each person must see or perform his little science experiments in order to prove things. 

let's say I have the funding and qualifications to perform an experiment while you don't. I did the experiments. does that mean I have to keep what I found to myself? If everyone has the same ideology as you we would be thousands of years behind what we have now.  

Knowledge is power, but so does human working together for it. Only by using past experiences and knowledge gathered by older generation that we can learn and discover new things for our younger generations in which when the time comes, they will use our knowledge to discover even new things. 

I know how shitty educational system is and how greedy people are in exploiting business in education sector but learning is part of living. And if you refuse to start learning from where our previous generation left off then you'd need to learn everything from 0. let's say 0 is the early stone age when controlled fire is a new thing, according to  Kris Hirst, an archaeologist,  then that would mean you need to learn more than 1.4 million years worth of knowledge from all our ancestors combined. How many truths and knowledge we abandoned because we discover new ones in the span of 1.4 million years?

Anyway I hope you do well in your journey to reach 2020.

those number are processed, verified and published by experts in respective field. are you an expert?

they have every right to claim and validate the claim given their expertise in the field.

btw I posted the experiment for you to try out in the other comment.

don't confuse science with religion. religion is faith based. science is data based. facts can be derived from data and can be changed if proven wrong. religion cannot change unless you make our own branch or religion. In order to change the data and validate data you need to do research which needs funds and formal qualifications of the field you're making change in. For making a new religion or branch of existing one you don't need anything but followers.

for truth it's even simpler. truth in religion and truth in science are different. truth in religion is absolute while truth in science is not. you can't say God A is our God and then say God B is our God in the same monotheistic religion. only by creating a new religion or branch of it that it can be done. But with science you can do this if you have enough data supporting it.

to oversimplify an example of this, you see someone died after drinking a shot of vodka. vodka being dangerous is now your truth. then after forensic investigation it was found out that the guy who died had taken 40 shots of vodka prior to dying. the truth now changes from vodka is dangerous to drinking too much vodka is dangerous.

before you complain that my example has nothing to do with earth or space do remember we are talking about truth in science and religion. forensic is a part of science."

gravity is an attraction force. your ball certainly did not have enough mass to produce said force therefore your ball only generate push force from its surface. without the pull force to counter it of course water fling away.

now try this experiment instead. buy a ferofluid or commonly known as liquid metal. then get yourself a magnet strong enough to keep metal attracted to it. now fling it around. your magnetic force is a subtitute for the gravity.

Now then you would say ""thats just magnets not gravity"". technically yes. but unless you have something like a black hole as a toy there's not a single object on earth that has mass big enough to generate gravitational force strong enough to keep things on it."

`If someone makes a claim, and then says i cant see the proof because its too big, or too far, or too expensive, then i have no good reason to believe what they say.`

what can't you see? that the earth is too big? there's literally an exact number telling you how big the earth is and it is explained how they get the number. too far? have you ever been in a plane? have you ever gone to faraway country? the time to get there compared to the speed of your transportation alone should be common sense. too expensive? do you know how costly a research is? have you ever done actual research outside google and youtube?

 `If all those people are actually getting the same results, then it should be no problem for me to get those results, right here, where i can see them personally, as they happen` 

those people are scientist. professors. people who are experts in the field with experience probably longer than you've been alive. those results you keep asking for is free on the internet if you actually search for it and read it unless you're in the middle of some amazonian jungle.

prove gravity isn't real, prove how small the earth is, prove the earth stays still.  that's right. you can't. By the way, pointing to something that someone else says or does, isn't proof. That is you trusting them.  And you can, if you wish. However, only an idiot, or an ignorant person, or someone who is both, would believe something because some person, somewhere, did something, and they say its so.

arguing how flat the earth is without knowing how small earth is a baseless claim.  for all I know I can claim that the earth is cylinder or a triangle or even an abstract.

flat earth was a fact until modern science proved it otherwise. it is now merely a theory with too many flaws."

DotA2,fdj2wo0,t3_elh3bs,1578457035.0,Do you need a coach? hit me up if you do.
DotA2,fdfqn80,t3_ekyqtz,1578367858.0,"idk about you guys but I used to carry with pos 4 almost every single game when I was in 800MMR bracket all the way to 3.5k.  after that you have to rely on your teammates.

tips for low bracket players who knows they are better than their bracket instead of assuming they're better:

1. pick heroes that can clear waves and tower quickly. low bracket players love kills much more than winning. something like prophet, visage.
2. pick heroes that can jungle effectively. you wont be punished in this bracket. but dont pick something like LC since she push slow. a hero like lycan would be really good as you can jungle push and solo kill enemy that is overextending.
3. dont buy midas. most of the time players in low brackets farm really ineffectively. taking objectives would further trash their farming and you will win quick and easy.
4. make the enemy tilt. this is legit strat that I used to win many games. tilting = bad mood = bad plays.
5. don't jump roles and heroes. you'll just get confused and won't be able to fully understand your heroes' maximum limits.
6. use the mute feature. dota2 players are toxic. as soon as you see a toxic chat or hear toxic voice just mute and play your game. if you reply to them you'll just get in bad mood and thus you play bad.

heroes that I used to boost my rank and still viable in this patch :

1. NP. go offlane, buy a ward and put it between tower 1 and 2 or 2 and 3. don't be cheap to use your W kill all the courirs and join all the fight unless you can get an obj
2. puck and weaver. low bracket players are trash at buying detection/disable items. get in, kill, get out rinse and repeat.
3. lycan. extremely god tier in low bracket. people dont know how to deal with this guy. get bkb and bam suddenly you're getting 2 sets of barracks
4. treant protector. really good early even in high tier. people just cant trade with you. get the meme hammer and you can get all the tower 2 before enemy carry get items.
5. bounty hunter. you wouldn't believe this but people dont care about tracks in lower bracket. I spammed like 500ish game with him and its unbelievable how enemy would just ignore bh tracks. 5-10 track kills at 12 mins almost guarantee you to win the game. just dont be an ass and build deso first item."

DotA2,fdcsnxr,t3_ekikjo,1578283196.0,brave of you to assume dota isn't more toxic than ow
DotA2,fd8r2gb,t3_ek75se,1578222149.0,let me guess.. archon or below?
DotA2,fd8qhdd,t3_ejzonr,1578221870.0,why not 10 heroes like the original game tho?
SuicideWatch,fd8qdbq,t3_ek5aj2,1578221812.0,link to videos? I'd like to see too
SuicideWatch,fd8pcil,t3_ejysqk,1578221347.0,this. but except of my fear of death I fear the pain I need to first go through before dying. I don't have access to painless method so here I am wishing a truck would just ram me to death on my way to work
misanthropy,fd8ot2u,t3_edv5ub,1578221097.0,yes. I know its hard but you have to act/put up a front.
