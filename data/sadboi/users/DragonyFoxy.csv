I know it's really hard but try doing your best, I believe in you, just don't give up. You're very young, whole life is right before you, also try focusing on positive things, there must be something what makes you happy and relaxed.

&#x200B;

To be honest I don't know if it was hard challenge or not. First (with normal settings and normal cash) I was repeating it like 50 times, then I started to finally change some settings but I'm not sure about that, I think I lowered them too much. But even that, the challenge was still kinda tough for me.

&#x200B;

* Rounds: 1-100
* Bloons Speed: 30%
* MOAB Speed: 30%
* Ceramic Health: 75%
* MOAB Health: 75%
* Starting Cash: 6 650$
* Reverse mode

&#x200B;

I beat it with (as you can see):

* Gwendolin \[20\]
* Wizard Monkey \[5-0-2\]
* Super Monkey \[0-4-2\]

&#x200B;

At first I was trying to do it with \[x-x-4\] Super Monkey but I wasn't able to purchase \[2-0-3+\] because I would have problems with Purple Bloons (which honestly were the most problematic in this run). Then I thought to save my money first for \[0-0-4\] Super but I thought it would be already too late, so I finally decided for \[0-3-2\] and I bought \[0-4-2\] at about 90 round. Please tell me, what you think about it.

I have T4 monkey and T2 monkey. T4 monkey should cost 5% less and T2 monkey should attack 5% faster but none of them has any of these buffs. Unless I upgrade my T2 to T3, they gain ""cost 5% less"" buff once again but only for a moment, until I buy another T0-T2 monkey. It's really weird imo. All T0-T2 should always have faster attack speed and T3-T4 should always cost 5% less regardless of Primary Monkeys being placed in the game.
