vjing,fppk9fa,t1_fppin0j,1588803831.0,"The biggest thing I found that helped get more interesting shapes was to transform the space over the layers. I'm using a pixel shade and I do a matrix transformation that's modulated by which frame in my array we are in, scaling up I believe as it's further back in time.

I'm also using hsv colors here instead of RGB so that I can combine hues nicer. I can't remember if I did it in this one but I played around with different amounts of layering - some i just added all the layer values together and some experiments I had a opacity value defined by the noise shape which cut the colors out and gave a more layered effect.

I also use a fair amount of exponential functions to change the aggressiveness of various values.

I find that using 'woo' words can have utility in talking about some of these very abstract experiences we have. If you come across woo you don't understand or seems absurd, the aim should be to understand, not to dismiss outright. If I understand something then I can probably find a way to relate it to my experiences and learn from what's being discussed.

However, I refrain from emboding the reality of the woo. It seems like a nice reality to be in, but my understanding of the world can handle these ideas so I see no reason to abandon it. For example, Collective consciousness could be understood as subconscious communication between people, empathy etc.

There's definitely a bit of a barrier between the woo and science, it's hard to reconcile a flamboyant, mythical reality with what I understand about the world as anything more than abstract ideas."
