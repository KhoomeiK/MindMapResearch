But you are not alone. I only recently turned 18 and I already don't know what to do with my life. I don't want to do anything.

I feel worthless and I hate existing. I hate experiencing life and having to participate, and I hate being a burden to the people who genuinely care about me.

&#x200B;

I am not prepared for the future and I wish I hadn't existed in the first place.

So far I have spent every birthday with my dad's side of the family and only during the last few have I genuinely wished to rather spend it alone. The wishes they give, as well as the goals they set for my life and incredible messages they give me makes me feel like a complete disappointment, although they haven't come to that realization yet.

&#x200B;

I can't supply help and tell you how to feel better, but I can tell you that you are not wrong. Just because you are different and feel that you amount to nothing does not diminish your value. The people I know have all found a way to make it and I hope I do to, but I also hope you do too."

""He"" is written as ""彼"", and ""she"" is written as ""彼女"", which basically means ""female he"". We is  ""私達"" (ehich is basically plural 'me') ""They"" (a group of people of non specific gender) is 彼ら (plural he), which is the same for all male, while ""彼女達"" (plural female he) is all female. So the word ""彼"" is directly translated to ""he"" but it is mostly gender neutral when used in different context

While in English you would refer to an animal or inanimate object as ""it"", in Afrikaans you would (sometimes) refer to it as ""hom"" (him) while still being genderless."
