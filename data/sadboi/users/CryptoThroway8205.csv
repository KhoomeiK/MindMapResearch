depression,foncdbq,t3_exo6f1,1587916755.0,I made a nice video yesterday. That's something. Felt nice to create something but I don't do it often so I wasn't perfect. But it didn't need to be. I think I need to allow myself that liberty to not be perfect.
getdisciplined,fon3aap,t3_g6k6q9,1587911233.0,"Thanks for this post. Yeah my therapist and I are talking about the same thing. I don't do well with criticism from others, why do I always blame everything on myself, even things that weren't really my fault?

Dealing with the root cause of the video game addiction is important because otherwise I'll just distract myself with other things. I'm not really a terrible person. I was just raised to believe I was."

Gonna make some eggs and eat."
depression,fmcoab8,t3_fucs7e,1585949534.0,What if like 20% of people would use it though if it were that easy. Just one bad day/one bad week/one bad illness/injury and it's over.

StopGaming,fm35a2m,t3_fsos6y,1585713233.0,Yeah I sorta want to talk to my friends and brother through games. But I don't partly because I don't want to game and partly cuz it's embarrassing to talk to them.
depression,fm2upnp,t3_exo6f1,1585705851.0,"I'd like to pretend I'm not so lazy. I know that might be the depression calling me lazy.  

But I'd like to pretend that I haven't spent all this time just seeking out dopamine and wasting time. That I'm a person who had his life together yesterday and for the past few years. And do what that person would do. At least this way I won't think ""I can't do that, I'm not capable because I wasn't capable yesterday.""  

Not sure I wrote this in a way that makes sense."

depression,flxcun8,t1_flwghg9,1585580341.0,"Yeah. I find when I'm doing well I tend to journal more. Like when I was seeing a therapist I had an entry every day. When I'm working I think it's usually similar unless I get addicted to a game.  

Is it the same for you?"

I haven't eaten today. Which is normal but still sucks.

I don't take this coronavirus seriously. At any point my city could quarantine and shit could hit the fan. But I'm still not getting groceries.

I just spent a lot of my day watching the office videos. Blocking youtube won't work as I'll go elsewhere but I'm trying to quit a certain game and my mind is just going to whatever addicting things I can do otherwise for the dopamine hit.

Taxes too..."

depression,flhfdme,t3_exo6f1,1585161604.0,I actually don't mind Corona other than it making it harder to find jobs and the risk of contagion. It feels good that no one else is outside when I rarely go out. Like they're not getting ahead. It's also a nice way for people to take a bit of a break if their work closed down or at least work from home for an indefinite period which is way more relaxed than in an office. It'll definitely make people have more conversations on wfh when this is all over.
depression,flgpk0i,t3_fon2l0,1585147771.0,I think the issue is if you're not in a good place you won't be able to hold a relationship with anyone who's not in a good place either or willing to put up with it. A relationship doesn't fix depression.

When depressed it's easy to overreach and try to do more than I can or should expect.  

Thinking about my friend from yesterday. I think he asked very generic questions about where I was working and hobbies. But I don't know if it's my insecurities or I just hate sharing that stuff with people who will look down on me for still playing games."

I'm feeling down today. No twitch streamers to watch. Just thinking of myself as shit. I'm ok though. Just need to be a bit productive.

I have an issue with anxiety. Like when I play online ranked games I get scared and don't like climbing too high. But the way to combat that is just to play more ranked games. Same for life. To deal with real life anxiety just face it.

On top of that Corona does suck. It's less incentive to go to any gyms as the virus can probably survive on gym equipment and cafe tables. I have bad lungs so it's a bit more risky for me."
