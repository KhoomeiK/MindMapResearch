Psychosis,fqzt3p3,t1_fqzsthe,1589774729.0,That‚Äôs good insight to have. But nah if it helps with all that I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt help with mental diagnoses as well
Psychosis,fqzsfso,t1_fqzs5da,1589774291.0,"I haven‚Äôt heard that yet, but will keep it in mind. Have you noticed a difference from the diet"

Psychosis,fqzchxm,t1_fqzca3n,1589764487.0,"I agree. For me it‚Äôs a gradual thing. Day by day I feel as if I‚Äôm slipping further and further away, almost as if I‚Äôm fading out. Ify man."
Psychosis,fqzccyz,t1_fqz8x70,1589764404.0,"I try not to read too much into it. But when I can‚Äôt help but think about it, I just let it happen."
Psychosis,fqzc4qn,t1_fqzbyuu,1589764270.0,Right. You just don‚Äôt know what it is. You can just physically feel something that is mentally wrong.
schizophrenia,fqz4h8c,t1_fqz00sk,1589759755.0,I guess I‚Äôll have to do try n do the same:)

schizophrenia,fqyzpuw,t1_fqyz73q,1589757347.0,You‚Äôre welcome. It took me a couple minutes to figure out how to put itüòÇ but this happens to you?
Psychosis,fqyzk55,t1_fqyy6bf,1589757262.0,"It is. Especially when you‚Äôre trying to get an important point across, and you just forget. 9 times out of 10 when I‚Äôm speaking a sentence I have to say ‚Äú damn I forgot what I was gonna say‚Äù"
schizophrenia,fqyz2gg,t1_fqyy2uy,1589757021.0,"I do have Truman delusions to some degree, such as everything in the world is centered around me and that my interactions with new people, are staged to see how I react and sometimes I feel as if the world around me is a stage of sorts. But I can‚Äôt tell if they are hallucinations, or if they are real things. For example, when I was pulling out of my neighborhood, as I came to a stop I noticed a pigeon perched on top of the stop sign with its head cocked sideways staring maliciously at me, and it‚Äôs head followed me as I drove away. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it."
Psychosis,fqyxo4z,t1_fqyxcqv,1589756339.0,"Thank you. Not many people do which is strange. I have yet to have any brain damage, yet I do find myself stuck quite often, I will stop in the middle of a sentence because the thought just wasn‚Äôt there anymore.

Someone suggested ambien but I don‚Äôt think ambien is as strong as trazadone or mirtazapine, as far as sleep goes, but it‚Äôs hard to compare the three due to two of them being from a completely different class of drugs."
schizophrenia,fqylf64,t1_fqyiycu,1589750493.0,How long have you been on it? At first it worked for me but now I am on trazadone and mirtazapine for sleep and anxiety and it doesn‚Äôt work

Psychosis,fperb7b,t1_fpeqq6e,1588553275.0,"It all depends on your reasons for wanting to be friends. It would be wrong IMO to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù with him based off the fact that he his mentally unstable. Now, if you guys already had relationship problems before hand, you should not feel guilt tripped to continue to be with him. If that is truly how you are feeling, I would recommend waiting until he is in a better place mentally as you telling him how you‚Äôre feeling atm could lead to him becoming more unstable."

Regarding the persistent checking of doors to make sure they are locked, and searching the bed for bugs it sounds more like OCD."
