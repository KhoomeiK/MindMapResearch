i had to ask someone out to coffee for the first time a few months ago; it was scary but it was also so fun and there is no pressure. just say you think they're cool and you want to get to know them. hanging out and getting food is innocent, just be friendly and if it goes well invite them out again! i am shy too and it is way easier if you take baby steps.

depression,f0kdgow,t1_f0kc68w,1568676796.0,"I would advise against a general practitioner and instead make an appointment with a psychiatrist in your area. I never have gone through a GP to get my mental health medication, although they do have the license to give it to you. I just have heard it is a more straightforward approach to getting help for depression and stuff like that because psychiatrists are trained specifically in that area. A psychiatrist will still examine/interview you with questions to diagnose you. And if you are interested in trying anti-depressants, I would avoid mentioning that you have tried Adderall and don't tell the doc about any other recreational drug use. I know it is not the easiest route, but I promise it is the best idea in the long run.

I take the SSRI Lexapro (been on it since age 17), and it requires a doctor's prescription but it is not quite as strict as a Schedule II drug. Regardless of which doctor you go to, make it clear to them you think you might be depressed and are looking for treatment. Doctors are required to be careful and suspicious when it comes to prescriptions but this doesn't mean you should be afraid to ask about them! :)"
depression,f0kb3oq,t1_f0k5p15,1568674967.0,"That comes from the huge dopamine rush. Your brain isn't used to such a high volume of dopamine, so your reward center kind of maxes out and EVERYTHING seems more interesting and fun. It seems like a really awesome thing, but if you make self-medicating a habit, your brain will stop producing its own dopamine. Then the depression will REALLY set in. This is why it is a Schedule II controlled substance and doctors prescribe each patient a specific milligram dose. I'm pretty sure if Adderall is giving you ADHD symptoms then what you need is an anti-depressant, not a stimulant."
