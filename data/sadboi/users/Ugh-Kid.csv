Maybe having small yet specific objectives can be a good first step in slowly building up some mental and physical stamina that can get you up and about. Could even be simple as wake up, make your bed, have some breakfast then go out for a 10 minute walk or so around the block then back home for a shower kind of thing, just doing that could be a good start for you to be able to critically think about certain other goals you’d like to do.

I’d say your best bet would be to hit up someone you know that has history with it and ask if they can suss you any of the goods. I’ve noticed most people who smoke completely understand the anxiety part of it and so most people don’t mind helping out in that way. I understand it sounds impossible/lame to do so but it’d be the healthiest way to go about it imo. Also if you get along with the person you could offer them some that you buy to show you how to smoke and all that.

I lowkey want to be that guy who makes everyone feel welcomed and easy to get along with but since I have this speak when spoken to style everyone says that I’m too daunting to approach and so over time I’ve genuinely turned into a loner until only recently with this new crew I’m with.
