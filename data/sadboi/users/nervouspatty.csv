I stumbled upon a woman name Nora Mcinerny, she has a podcast called Terrible thanks for asking, and a book called, It’s ok to laugh, crying cool too. Both are great. She had such a refreshing outlook on grief and isn’t preachy. It was extremely helpful to me. 

At the very least, I highly recommend this Ted talk she did,

AmItheAsshole,f745dz7,t3_duc2do,1573398427.0,"NAH. You’re being cautious and for good reason. They want you to bond with their child who may feel like there’s a tear in the family, this may be a way to make it not feel that way, however if things take a turn and mom is no longer ok with it then immediately stop. 

I would r/asklegal to see if a text allowing you to do so is and is ok with the mother, despite what the court document says. It’s obviously not legally binding but might come in handy if she does change her mind."
AmItheAsshole,f743x2o,t3_duc9ez,1573397986.0,"NTA. I wouldn’t say your boyfriend is racist but just very ignorant. He said some racist things but I don’t think that’s actually who he is. I think reevaluating you’re relationship is always good, I may be alone in this thought but I believe you can fall in love with anyone if the circumstances are right, so making sure the more logistical stuff like this fits is important. 

A conversation needs to be had so you can evaluate if he’s willing to listen and grow. Also maybe you can gauge better if he actually is a racist by the way he feels about certain things."

First of all, please do not take medication that is not prescribed to you for many many reasons. Second of all beta blockers are not a controlled substance so your doctor will not have too much problem prescribing them (there may be something they see with your history that we don’t that will prevent this.) Second, I am prescribed beta blockers as needed and it’s been a non issue, not to mention my doctor was fine with this. There are Harvard research papers on almost anything you can think of. Just talk to your doctor it’s the only for sure way to figure out what’s best for you."
