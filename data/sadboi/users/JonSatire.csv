Ruleset: fuck them bitches. Having a waifu would be nice, but why settle for one when I can spend a year improving myself into being in better health and irresistable? Gimme dem 6 perks.

Better Shape, by fucking Hayley the lithe, energetic fitness bunny. Fooling around in the shower followed by a nice of power struggles sounds fun, and I can hit the gym for those GAINZ.

Charisma Boost, bein fucked by Hanna, the pale brunette with a mommy complex. Almost picked her as a waifu, but I'd settle for one really relaxing night that made me sharper about people. I'm already pretty perceptive, but the captivating voice and instinctive responses sounds dynamite.

Confidence Booster, wrecking poor little Kim. Working her up into a frenzy and then walking away with that confidence aura that makes my weird ass seem more normal and strong? Easy.

Magical Tongue, dommed by Monique the asian busty petite. I mean, that alone speaks for itself. The perk is gravy, but helps with all my other plans.

Attract the Prey, a night with Emily and a friend of her choice. Nearly chose an extra girl on the list to be cheeky, but naw. Gimme more of those auras.

Sexual Knowledge, sharing an intimate night with Sophia the kind brainy beauty. Just sharpens everything I can do to be utterly amazing, all for the grand goal.

Parting Gift: Life of Power. I'm going to spend a year working out and working on my confidence and just getting better at understanding and communicating with people. I'll use my sex god powers to help people who are down on their luck and turn their lives around. And or become a cult leader, gaining increasing magical charm as my followers spread and infiltrate all levels of society. Tragically, my reign will be cut down after being poisoned, beaten, stabbed, shot, and thrown into a river, but I'm okay with that."

Each sentence should flow into the next, and the paragraph ends when you've done what you can with the point of it and flow into the next one as seamlessly as possible. Unless being abrupt or forcing a shocked stop is the point, naturally. 

When you're writing a story, you're not just stringing along a bunch of words telling people what's going on. You're guiding the reader on a journey. Sentence and paragraph structure is the best way to lead them by the nose.

SchizoFamilies,fjx4rzq,t3_ee9bpp,1583656695.0,"I'm schizoaffective. I was diagnosed at 15, and only first tried cannabis at age 28. The first couple of times I tried it, it very much felt like turning my psychosis on for the duration, but on low. I saw more things flickering around the edges of my vision of the kind I normally see, but with none of the anxiety that usually comes with it. Normally when I begin hallucinating it's accompanied by intense fear and/or stress. Nothing.

After a while and as I kept trying, even that died down. Now it's just about the only thing that actually helps with my symptoms without turning me into a zombie. I'm not suggesting every schizo go out and get blazed, but I find that it helps with the anxiety that comes from psychosis and the rage/agitation from the bipolar symptoms. More research needs to be done, but some of the research out there seems to suggest a possibility that schizos seek cannabis out instinctively.

Secondly, that's spot on. Just being willing to be accountable for your own actions is huge. The whole ""it's always on the husband to apologize even when they did nothing wrong"" thing is bullshit, archaic, and is a gross double standard that should've died at least 30 years ago.

And since I am disabled and take care of the house while she works, that often means that if I am up to date on cleaning and everything is okay, I can go a little stir crazy looking for more to do to not feel like I am being useless.

We recently moved to Vegas, and there's a casino with a movie theater in it just a few miles away. So she encouraged me to get the unlimited movie pass and spend some days enjoying time to myself with movies and 5c video poker. As an introvert and a bit of a recluse, this has honestly been an amazing change in my life that's done wonders for my mental health.

And seeing how yours and others' comments are talking about the romance, I can see why Circe could be a bit of a let down if you wanted more of that.

But Circe is really emotionally meaty and thicc if you relate at all to being unwelcome and on the outside of things.

It's kind of hard to just give a simple answer here, because there really aren't any simple answers.

It's less about receiving advice and more about being given the tools to figure it out for yourself. Take one of your favorite books, one you've read a million times. Reread it, but with a writer's eye. Look at the structure, the pacing, the characters. Look at how each sentence and paragraph flows together...Or how it doesn't.

I know that's not fast and easy, but it's the best I've got. Reread an old favorite and take notes about how and why it works, and notes about what doesn't work for you. Break down how it handles a scene, structurally and through character. Imitate it."

Used to be any gladiators would be good for it, but time and gentrification made the role unsavory. He dressed as an undead soldier with a skull facemask, with seemingly white pain has him look like death. Truth is he's a quiet, fairly kind man with albinism who loves being able to fight in front of an audience but hates that he has to kill. 

The story will explore that dichotomy and follow his career change. How long have the nobility been immortal in your story? Is the executioner's name and knowledge of how to kill them widespread?"

Roughly 1/4 of her act was making fun of men with small penises. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person there who wasn't laughing. If it wasn't small dick jokes, it was about rape and other things that are...Well, people complain when guys joke about that shit, but apparently she got a free pass. It was terrible.

After, she came up to the bar where I was sitting with some of the event organizers and shooting the shit. She was asking people how they liked her act. I left before she could get to me, and you know why? If you're annoyed at small dick jokes, most people just assume you have a small dick and are getting indignant over it. There's no winning.

AskReddit,fech2mt,t1_feceo9j,1578973752.0,"The big difference is that tall, rich, black, living in other countries are objective facts. Gender is a human construct that is a passed on idea that people more or less agree on to some extent. You can't magically change and make yourself taller or a different ethnicity. Those are object facts. The fact that gender is a shared, fluid, idea that has changed over time as society has progressed means it is by definition subjective. It's something that can be explored and interpreted differently.

I don't mean to be pointed with this next statement, but. They don't need to justify their feelings to anyone. If you don't get it, that's fine. I'm pretty accepting but some stuff is weird, even for me. But so long as they're not hurting anyone, we don't get to decide what's too far or necessary for anyone. Not because them existing and being happy might make you uncomfortable.

We all gotta learn to live with each other, and it's way easier to do when people let each other be."
AskReddit,fec4mg7,t1_fec2gn0,1578966578.0,"Those are good questions MrFaggutron, and not ones with easy answers. It varies for everyone, but there are a number of common experiences and feelings associated more strongly with one gender over the other. 

Some people feel they don't match up with the same idea of that gender as others, and they feel it strongly enough to feel uncomfortable with the idea of considering themselves all guy or girl, or maybe more comfortable with some grey area in the middle. And some feel like it varies from day to day. That's the one I think people get stuck on, and it's understandable. 

You said you're a guy. You don't have to think about what it means to feel like a guy. Most guys who've never had to think about it don't, they just accept it. But haven't you ever thought about what it must be like to be a girl? It's gotta be way different, right?

fantasywriters,eznn0d1,t3_d1fj9v,1568008406.0,"I have nine major gods in my setting. They're all generally benevolent, just prone to fucking up a lot. They and the world are young and still getting the hang of things. Their first creations, their children, were basically unruly and mildly evil and will serve as the setting's equivalent of demons/devils and fae.

At the start of my story, the gods have been mostly absent for nearly 200 years and people have gotten more or less used to doing things on their own. A future story will deal with their return and how it affects the world. For now, they're world building."
todayilearned,eyrbckc,t1_eyqqyuu,1567364367.0,"Hi there. As a person with schizophrenia, it's really hard to get or hold down a job, especially in today's economy. With the diagnosis, I've found there to be a really rough catch-22. If I told prospective employers about my illness, they wouldn't hire me. Literally none of the places I told hired me. So just don't tell them, right? Every place I got hired I didn't tell them. And then when they found out, I got let go shortly after. It's damned near impossible for them to NOT find out, because it does affect your everyday life. It will likely impact your work. Sometimes not much, sometimes a lot. And with how many states can fire you for any or no reason at all, it leaves us in a pretty shitty situation.

Additionally, keeping it to ourselves is something we often do and have to do. But you know what? It's incredibly painful and isolating to deal with this on our own. And feeling like we NEED to keep it quiet is even worse. Other people knowing in advance goes a long way towards them having a better understanding or acceptance towards us when we're going through a rough spot.

You don't fight a stigma by bowing down to it and hiding. You fight it by trying to raise awareness and educate others."
writing,eynd5st,t1_eyn9mz2,1567242348.0,"I'm taking you being intrigued as an opportunity to gush about it! You activated my trap card, etc.

My MC is a gladiator with albinism and severe body image issues. When he was a young teen, he opened up after the death of a parent to a female friend who decided to...comfort him. He was woken abruptly and paraded naked in front of dozens of people so that he and his friend could be reprimanded. It traumatized him, and for roughly the next 20 years he couldn't stand being undressed in front of anyone. Especially women. He has to deal with that after being injured while saving his newest friend, a prostitute, who needs to tend to his wounds. Undressing in front of her so she can stitch him up makes him face it.

I don't often see male warrior characters with crippling anxiety and sexual trauma, and it's been a blast to write."

In one of the chapters I recently wrote, my MC is being confronted with something related to one of his worst traumas. I made the prose more intimate and in his head than usual, and far more rambling and untethered, only to cut off mid sentence to a new paragraph to show how hard he avoids dealing with it. I do it a couple of times to show how his entire thought process shuts down hard, and I am pretty satisfied with how it reads."
AskReddit,eym0gz3,t1_eykqoz3,1567196430.0,"I think that Johnny Bravo is honestly a fantastic show for just that reason. He's an unsympathetic comedy protagonist. Whenever he is aggressive or gross around women, it backfires horribly. It's not only funny, but it taught a lot of impressionable children a valuable lesson. ""This shit doesn't work. Don't do this. Girls hate it, and it's gross.""

That lesson obviously didn't stick with everyone, but it was one of a few influential (wannabe) womanizing characters I grew up with that helped make sure I wasn't a shithead to people I was attracted to."

I can see why that looks off, but hypervigilance is definitely something a lot of us experience when our psychosis is especially bad. When you're that on edge, you notice every shadow and sound around you and it's pretty painful. The voices mechanic felt like a pretty decent representation of that experience to me."
