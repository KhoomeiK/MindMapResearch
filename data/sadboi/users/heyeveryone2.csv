It had different rooms and statues and decorations and the people working on it all seemed like models. For real, i truly believe they were models or people aspiring to be models because holy shit everyone in there was 10/10.

Apart from the store, i gotta talk about their polo shirt. I'm used to wear simple t-shirts and i have one or two cheap polo shirts. They are *good enough* and never gave me any trouble but once i entered the store, omg i felt like i was a king. The most beautiful women said hi to me and asked me what i was looking for, i said a simple polo shirt. She asked if i had a color preference and i said no, so she brought like 20 different colored shirts for me to try without giving a glimpse of impatience. After trying a few i remember i chose a red one and she said something like ""yeahh you look very good on it"" BUT THEN one of the most beautiful guys i've ever seen in person came in and said ""dude, try the blue one, i think it suits you best"". And he was 100% right. The blue color was stunning and i thanked them both for their patience and very nice service.

After a few days switching between this nice new polo shirt and my generic t-shirts everytime i went trough a mirror i could see the difference. My posture looked better. My chest and arms looked stronger. Overall, I looked way better than before.

Since i'm still at uni, most of my clothes are generic but once i put some of my ""more expensive"" clothing, i can definitely tell the difference.

Also, yes, the logo is super small. Like, the guy playing polo is the size of my thumb."

Why those vulnerabilities didn't existed on Xp or W7 like they do with W10? And **why** can't we choose when to download stuff, instead of going to turn off the pc and seeing a ""update and turn off"" screen like it happens most of the time?"
pcmasterrace,fn9yya3,t1_fn9sm4n,1586787716.0,"I only said that as an user i would prefer to download updates every once in a while, like i did with Xp and W7, instead of downloading updates three times a week, like i do with W10. Care to explain why my preferences are ""talking out of my ass?"" lmao

edit: If someone else wants to know the why W10 has so many updates, the dumbshit down there didn't answered anything useful. [The answer is here](https://www.howtogeek.com/406120/why-does-windows-10-update-so-much/). The reason is basically because most of us use Windows Defender and since it's an antivirus, its updates are included in the main Windows Update platform. And antiviruses receive updates daily. Yes, i learned my lesson, google first instead of trying to ask on reddit to a know it all lol."
pcmasterrace,fn9rbdk,t1_fn9qq1u,1586782560.0,"Please tell me this is a joke lol. Who in their right mind likes to keep downloading updates instead of receiving a product that already works 100%? I understand when a bug happens we have nothing to do besides download an update to fix it but it's not possible that with every update something breaks and needs to be fixed and the cycle never stops lol

edit: Just to clarify, i understand that ""receiving a product that works 100%"" is like a fairy tale here lol. What i really meant is, why people claim the end user wants regular updates? As an end user, i want an update when it's necessary. I don't need to be reminded 3x a week that the company still cares."
pcmasterrace,fn9p3od,t1_fn9mpit,1586780779.0,"I would like to understand why Windows 10 has SO MANY updates. With Windows Xp and Windows 7 it was a lot less and we could choose when to update. In W10 i feel like 90% of the time i startup my PC, windows starts to update and although the internet doesn't get any slower, my pc does lol"
pics,fn9n9q0,t1_fn9m6hg,1586779163.0,"[According to this source, it's not ""by far""](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/latest-on-coronavirus-outbreak/worldwide-covid-19-testing-ratio-per-country-million/1800124). We are doing 61% less. Not 100x worse. Also, i woud like to point again that we have **free** tests. At least here in Rio, me and some other people from my family that had corona-like symptoms and went to get tested, we did without a hassle and it was free. We are testing less people because most of the people that go get tested, test for negative (thank god for that) so we received instructions to only go the hospital if things are bad. Also, we are not anywhere near the amount of trouble the US is now so while we still have things under control, it makes sense to not overload the health system by testing everyone knowing that a lot of those tests will be a waste. 

Also, before we get to ""US level of trouble"", [we already have plans to increase the number of tests](https://labs.ebanx.com/en/notes/brazil-wants-to-multiply-by-10-the-number-of-covid-19-tests/).

So i'll say it again, the US is a lot worse to get tested."
pics,fn9hq9p,t1_fn950l8,1586773465.0,"> If you think testing in the US is bad, testing in Brazil is literally 100x worse.

May i ask how you came up to that? Because as a brazilian, i know first hand how things here suck, but saying our health system (that is free btw) is worse than the US made me laugh lol. I literally see everyday people thanking the SUS (our **FREE** health system) because they thought they had something, got tested and it was all free.

Yeah it's still a third world country and it's far from perfect but if we want to get tested we can do it and for free. We also have free treatment here."

""Since my two cousins and my uncle had to have surgery for that and my nose is kinda curved, we probably have this running in the family and maybe i have apnea as well. This could explain my insomnia""

She did a shocked face and asked ""how can you trash talk our family like that? Why is our family so problematic to you?"".

Dude, i didn't lie or said this in a bad tone, i was simply stating that i'm going to a doc to get this checked since close people in our family have it. She lost her shit. I honestly feel sorry for her because if our family is her most prized thing, omg i'll laugh until the day i die."
AskReddit,fn6qvl7,t3_fzwoqb,1586705528.0,"Is everyone sleep schedule fucked because of the lack of activities during the day or because you spend the entire day sleeping? Honest question because for a week now i sleep like 4h and wake up suddenly and only feel sleepy after the sun is out. This started out of nowhere because i still go to bed at the same time (around 22h, 23h). Could this be an effect of the quarantine?"

But still, i haven't seen this meme and i check this sub daily because it's always on my frontpage. Forgive me if this has been really reposted a lot but we also gotta acknowledge the different timezones and different times of the day people check reddit. From the looks of this, almost a 1000 people are probably seeing for the first time. If you can find links of this been reposted a few days ago i'll apologize but given the different timezones and different times of the day people check reddit, it might be old to you and new to others. Just report as breaking the rules and let the mods decide. But since 1000 people upvoted i guess this is new to a lot of people."
