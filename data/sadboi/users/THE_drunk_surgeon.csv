schizoaffective,fpmvrd7,t3_ge7zfx,1588743048.0,I was diagnosed at 24 but started having symptoms at 12. I might have been diagnosed sooner if I had more insight and trust but it is what it is.
schizoaffective,foilglc,t3_g7mxki,1587789676.0,"I'm kind of in the same boat as you, I have 40 pounds to lose and I found that keto indeed does help and so does steady low intensity cardio.

I'd check out Autumn Bates and Dr. Eric Berg DC on YouTube as they're the two main experts I watch.

I've lost 10 lbs in two weeks and while this may slow down I'll still be getting a decent downward rate.

Intermittent fasting, where you eat all your meals in a time frame (like 8/16, where you eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner within 8 hours) all helps a ton with keeping insulin levels low.

There's lots of good information out there, but it's sometimes hard to find, I hope you sent you in the right direction.

Edit: spelling"
schizoaffective,fgdwr4y,t3_exuqjr,1580687752.0,"I'm always surprised that people like me too. I isolate myself, I'm needy, and I generally don't feel like I fit in to any group. I feel like they may all be pretending, but why waste so much energy and resources on a joke relationship? You know the modern proverb, ""if you keep running into assholes, maybe you're the asshole""? I think you may be in an opposite situation. If everyone you meet thinks you're wonderful, maybe you are. It's hard to accept but probably true."
schizoaffective,ffb668d,t3_esmwao,1579752847.0,"Wellbutrin has had both negative and positive effects for me. The first time I tried it, it didn't do much except increase my attention span and make me unable to nap during the day. The second time (years later) I took it and I was so angry and nauseous that I had to stop after two weeks. I was taking different meds with it at the time. What I'm saying is that YMMV and that it's interaction with other drugs may make it work differently (or similarly) to what you imagine. Good doctors take the other medications you take into consideration when switching up your medications. If you discuss your goals in switching to wellbutrin but it doesn't work out, then your doctor may find you other drugs that act similarly. Anyway, good luck! (edit: a word)"

The best advice for any guy is to hit the gym always, this will boost not only your body in terms of attractiveness but also your confidence. 6/10"

The headaches might go away when your n body gets used to it, but try never to miss a dose because withdrawal starts within a few hours (you feel lightheaded and achy). I don't know how effective it'll be for you but hopefully it will be."

AskReddit,fadfohs,t3_e8kovv,1575969027.0,"Probably will get buried, but going through psychosis was the scariest thing for me. There have been lots of episodes but the parts I remember most vividly include just being terrified of everything. There's no sense to the fear and paranoia, and no way anyone can console you. I've had demons chase me, bugs attack me, my thoughts broadcasted for all to see, my classmates surveilling me, and worst of all the fear that some holy apparation would happen and the deity would condemn me to hell there and then. I'm better now with medication but I honestly still have trauma from the episodes."
