Underneath your knee cap, your femoral artery breaks off into three smaller arteries going down your lower leg. One of these arteries runs between your tibia and fibula. There‚Äôs no way to get that tourniquet tight enough to occlude all 3. Should‚Äôve been placed two inches above the knee, or gone High or Die and placed in on the thigh by the groin.

If it wasn‚Äôt even arterial bleeding, they should‚Äôve held direct pressure with sterile dressings and could‚Äôve probably controlled the bleed easily."

Your job is to take care of yourself with the aftermath of this relationship. You will have lasting effects from this. If I were you, I wouldn‚Äôt put all of my eggs in one basket.

Angry all the time, not giving a shit about me, promise something to my face and turn right around and break that promise, constantly blaming me for the way he treated me, etc. Honestly, he was an absolute nightmare while on them but I now know it‚Äôs because he never should have been on them in the first place. Finally, he was correctly diagnosed as bipolar type 2 and ADD. Since he‚Äôs been on a mood stabilizer and Adderall, he‚Äôs been so much better. He is such a huge help to me. He‚Äôs much more in touch with my emotions, as well as his own. He knows how to help me calm down when I get very upset out of nowhere (whether angry or sad). He knows how to actually ask for help now regarding his own emotions. He knows how to take responsibility for his own actions, and helps me understand when my actions are the problem. And honestly I‚Äôm so proud of him. It‚Äôs taken him hard work for a long time to get to where he is now, and he‚Äôs still working on himself."
