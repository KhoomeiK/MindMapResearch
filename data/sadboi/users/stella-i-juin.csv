Would you call it moral to do this to a person whose nerve endings were damaged such that they couldn't feel pain?) before you make the choice to fish again. Ask yourself what you are doing, and really examine whether you believe that you are doing something that is morally permissible, or if you are just telling yourself than because you don't want to think about a problem that you are contributing to.

I personally believe that it is morally permissible to enact violence in self-defense or in the defense of those who are innocent or unable to defend themselves. I would never advocate for violence or killing if I didn't think it was both necessary and justified. Not that it's particularly relevant, but I do not like the idea of violence and have a lot of difficulty absorbing violent media. I would not fault you for taking the position of ""never kill"" because you safeguard yourself from accidentally killing when it is not necessary or justified, a risk that my position does open me up to. Ultimately thought, it comes down to questions like: if someone is about to kill me, and I can stay alive by killing them, can I do so? If someone is about to kill my family and friends, and I can keep them alive by killing the perpetrator, is it okay to do so? If somebody is using extreme ideology to enact systematic genocide, war, oppression, etc, and I can end it by killing them and only them, is it okay to do so?
