mentalhealth,fqbtvf9,t3_ghrmqw,1589243819.0,"Same, ever since school started in September I've been at my lowest of lows, which ultimately accumulated to a suicide attempt. No one understood my emotions due to my ASD causing difficulties in explaining them, which caused a really bad cycle, but when I got used to quarantine I started to feel happier and my self esteem is higher than it ever has been. I definitely want to be around my friends but being around them 5 times a day while we couldn't understand each others' feelings was super draining and depressing. I'm so glad this happened, it might have just saved my life"
