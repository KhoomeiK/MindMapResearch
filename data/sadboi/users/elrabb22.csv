Huge mistakes were made on my part. 

You can do this."
Empaths,fqxral9,t1_fqx8j1x,1589736639.0,Thanks for this. I do feel like people are almost universally sensitive so they are going to be able to know you know \*something\* whether or not you are being intentionally or unintentionally judgmental.
Empaths,fqtqx88,t1_fqt6pne,1589644361.0,Good morning! LOLOLOL
Empaths,fqtqw9r,t1_fqtfjiw,1589644345.0,I definitely feel you. Use your intuition to know when to let things go. But don’t do too little or be weaker than you know you are.
Empaths,fqpe4rf,t3_gjsiuy,1589543956.0,I definitely have a major issue with this as well. Keep in mind some people use their powers of influence to \*make\* you forget what they have done and that some of this is about creating consistent boundaries to keep you aware of reality.

It just HIT me, He may have been right about the sandwich but the MATH of it all didn't make any sense. I started to put the deep verbal abuse together after that. Massive nightmare. Took years to recover."

Empaths,fpldvkb,t1_fpldk3h,1588710957.0,"I would definitely caution you to not prioritize productivity over the physical self. The point of cleanliness isn’t productivity in my honest opinion. Only you know what’s best for you! However unless you’re in a supervised or religious fast, I think that eating healthily is a priority way way way above clearing anything. Just my opinion!"
Empaths,fplb4o9,t1_fplb1sd,1588709558.0,I’m so proud of you!

Empaths,fpkmau1,t1_fpkf3i5,1588697202.0,This can be as simple as flossing your teeth and  washing your hair or as complex as getting a divorce and  sageing your entire home and body. I'm saying ask your intuition what is needed and DO it.

AskAstrologers,fpk00b0,t1_fpjooxx,1588685145.0,you can trace a lot of major life events to them and when aspects cross back over their occurrence.
AskAstrologers,fpjzxgb,t3_gdt5ws,1588685095.0,"Eclipses impact everyone though most particularly people who are natally related to the aspects at play. Understand what the moon MEANS - active subconscious, audience, mother, home , nourishment and you will see the significance in chart aspect. The zodiac is way way less significant than house placement when it comes to interpreting results, in western AND vedic."

LifeAfterNarcissism,fp0e8dr,t3_ga6zd9,1588207566.0,It's so upsetting to me that this is how much they can mess with your mind. The idea of being terrified of hurting others bc you might be this way means you aren't the slightest bit like them period.
Empaths,fozgo10,t1_foyj544,1588190346.0,Don't let it slip into psychosis. Learn to ground and to control your ability. Be self reliant as it relates to believing in yourself but maintain a very healthy and real relationship with material reality.

Empaths,foqmur0,t3_g8ryy2,1587996960.0,"Yes, I did go through this in my teens for a few years. I tried to manage it by working out ALOT. Honestly, this helps. I'm not sure if its a grounding thing or what but try spending more time going outside. Your heart is too open. There are many ways people suggest to mange that. Heart chakra meditations, clearing out the heart, grounding, boundary work - but you have to do something that works for you. If I fall in love - i do start to feel some what you have explained again - its really about just staying on top of it in my opinion.  Sorry for your experience - I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I find it's worse if the other person is not expressive bc then even MORE of their emotion goes to you. So, if they are in therapy or something - it lessens the impact on you."
