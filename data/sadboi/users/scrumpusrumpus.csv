hsp,fhls22z,t3_f3vtvt,1581703992.0,mindfulness! mindfulness is more than just meditating. you can practice it throughout the day and probably already do it a bit without even realizing. I recommend looking up Jon Kabat-Zinn and watching some of his videos explaining mindfulness and he also has some guided meditations. a major component is recognizing that thoughts are just thoughts. they come and go and it's up to us to decide if we want to let them come and go or fully engage in them.

I practice hip hinging with no weight first to warm up

I used to avoid exercises that I hated because I couldn't do them and felt they were too hard. I realized that if an exercise is really hard it just means that I need to work on it until it's easier.

I'm not that strong yet so I just do Romanian dead lifts with a barbell for now. at first I couldn't even do RDLs, my core was too weak to stay tight while hinging forward with weight. after a few month of using dumbbells for various exercises I was finally strong enough in my core to do RDLs. my thinking is that I just didn't have enough base strength to do them properly at first so I had to build that up.

cable pull throughs are great too!

Frugal,f0x9y64,t1_f0vsj11,1569026145.0,thank you for sorting your clothes and only donating wearable items! I volunteer at a homeless shelter sorting donations and people donate literal garbage and stained/ripped/smelly/gross clothes that we have to sort out and get rid of. thankfully we send unusable clothing to another company that uses them for rags or whatever but it's really time consuming to sort through and it just comes off as rude and lazy to donate trash and unusable items.

I hate my scars so much I sometimes think life with these scars isn't worth it and my body is ruined. I have to cover them at work and they just gross me out. I hate shaving my legs and putting on lotion because of the texture too.
EOOD,f0dujwc,t1_f0cba4z,1568558778.0,"what are you doing to help your depression aside from exercise? it isn't a cure all, it's only a part of feeling better that needs to be combined with other lifestyle changes and healthy coping skills

also, if you don't want to do cardio 7 days a week it's totally fine to cut down. I believe 150 minutes a week is recommended and that would be 5 days at 30 min. maybe you need rest?"

depression,f05q0s3,t1_f04rqja,1568416370.0,"part of depression is shitting on anything and everything people suggest. I find exercise really helps me, it doesn't fix or cure depression but it is a very important little piece. people are so quick to shut it down and say ""it doesn't help me"" because they expect it to be a miracle. but it's not a miracle, it's one small part to feeling better. I find that when i exercise, I eat better, I drink more water and it gets me off of my lazy depressed ass. I have had periods where I was so depressed I quit exercise because ""it doesn't even matter anyway, nothing does so why bother"". but getting back into exercise has been part of my recovery process every time and I wish people would stop shitting on it without even trying. literally everyone should be exercising anyway, depressed or not."
