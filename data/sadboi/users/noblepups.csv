smallbusiness,f0zceht,t1_f0z2tvk,1569091878.0,"My grandpa is a contractor and has been for 30 years. He started off as a carpenter, saved up some money and started his own remodeling company. His company is very highly regarded as being one of the best bathroom remodeling companies in Houston. That is his specialty, and he's so good at it mostly because of the people he hires. His title guy is a really hard worker and is damn good at his job. If you do bathroom remodels you need a damn good tile guy. Because tile makes a bathroom look so damn good when done well. 

He has framers, paint guys, electricians, plumbers, architects, engineers ect he can call on any time so you need to build a network. 

He does all the carpentry himself with a helper which gives him a good reason to be involved with job sites. It allows him to really stay on top of things. When business is bad, he knocks on doors, and gets business. Make sure you have a presence on Angie's list and other review sites. Be careful how you spend your money, tons of companies will want to offer various(cold callers) to you. 

Besides that make sure you give everyone a fair shake, because at least in my market there are so many shady contractors that half ass things the fact that he is a stand up guy that will take care of business really makes him shine. He gets tons of repeat business. 

Another piece of advice: dont spread yourself too thin with contracts. Put everything into finishing one or two contracts at a time before taking more on. You will probably figure that out in your business progression anyway, but there are alot of contractors here that will take in multiple projects and go slow as hell because they want to secure those contracts, but they sacrifice quality and building long term relationships for a quick buck. 

TLDR; Dont spread yourself too thin, work on your business every day, stand out from competition by doing good quality work, provide good communication/customer service, you will get alot of offers from companies to help your business, be careful how you spend your money, build a network of people that are damn good at what they do, people will hire you for that niche and once they're impressed with your work will hire you in the future for other projects."

stocks,f0t65la,t1_f0oonx0,1568916596.0,"If you knew anything about the freight market you would know how bad they are. All of the freight contracts are being swallowed up by the big trucking companys and uber freight is going after the spot market. Uber freight cannot compete with trucking companies rates. It will have to take a serious change in the industry for uber freight to get anywhere. 

So you're betting on uber to take over when automation comes, but there are plenty of other companies that are set up better to do that. I dont see how uber can win especially considering how the big trucking companies are consolidating. The industry is just really eating up the spot market, and I think it's really risky to bet on Uber becoming a big player once automation normalizes. The rate of big companies buying smaller ones will continue and the big companies will roll out automation to compete. All they have to do is satisfy their current contracts and uber will never be able to gain a foothold in the industry. 

So what you're really betting on is Uber doing a better job at automation than the other companies trying to implement it. So have fun betting against all of the major tech companies. Uber cant win here."
