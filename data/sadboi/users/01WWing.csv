EDH,fms82m5,t3_fwojy2,1586349311.0,"So we as a community just need to accept that the old days of Commander Precons brimming with value is over.

I hate being a cynic, but it is just a fact at this point. 

Here's the rough timeline of events.

2011 onwards - precons have great value reprints in them, and new cards that hold value well. This goes on right through commander 2017 with the tribal decks, where we saw reprints such as Mirari's Wake. 

Commander 2017 - This was a year where the commander precons really exploded in popularity. The amount of sales generated signalled the beginning of the end for high value precons.

Commander 2018 - the year where the community was outraged at the dreadful quality of the reprints, where for the first time ever the reprint value was slashed. Despite the community outrage, the product still sold extremely well, signalling to WotC that they could include less value in decks and it would still sell.

Gavin Verhey then comes out with the ""We've heard you loud and clear"" post, essentially implying that reprints will be up to scratch again in 2019.

Commander 2019 - Reprint quality is just as bad as the previous year, and new card value is arguably even worse. Product still sells out despite community dissatisfaction. WotC again see that EDH players will eat shit and still buy the product. Gavin V is laughing at how everyone bought his lie from the previous year.

Upon seeing how well the product sold and how big the demand and market is for EDH, WotC realise that they can put chase EDH cards into £10 booster packs to make bank, instead of reprinting them in precons, disguising their greed with the ""Thank you Commander players!"" Theme. 

At this point, we need to accept that this is the new standard for Commander Precons. The value is going to continually decline every year, because the product sells out every year. Commander 2018 should be our point of reference when comparing value for reprints. Commander 2017 and before should be viewed as an entirely different product line now, as we will never, ever get anything close to that quality again. 

This is the Hasbro world that we now play our EDH in."
