Thank you for sharing this opinion.

It's like someone has been handed a machine gun for the first time without having any concept of what a machine gun is and their first impulse is to point it at their head and fire for 5 straight minutes because Terence McKenna said so and it helps earn cool hippie brownie points. Fuck that. Bad metaphor but you get the point. People need to be responsible when using psychedelics. So MUCH more responsible.

The whole animal has to die. In the case of plants, they don't experience pain the way animals do. Now the way of survival for all beings on the planet is by consuming another life form. But, humans have a choice. Humans can choose to consume a life form that leads to much much lesser harm and pain and suffering. Now one may argue that agriculture also kills a lot of insects and pests. We have to understand here that, it is impossible to ensure human survival without causing at least some suffering to other beings. The same applies to survival of other life forms as well.

streamentry,fpcnqex,t3_gcfx3g,1588507260.0,"One of the reasons for the burping and farting could be the frozen food you ate during the retreat. According to Ayurveda, frozen food is devoid of any prana. Eating too much-frozen food creates excess 'Vata' (air element) in the body and leads to a build-up of toxins called 'ama'. The air element explains the burping and farting. Excess Vata also clouds the mind. The body's natural impulse is also to get rid of ama as soon as possible. In the long term, ama creates stiffness & sluggishness in the body and dullness in the mind. I remember the times I have lived in the US and have had to rely on pre-cooked and/or frozen food, I always have instant gastric issues. Whenever I switch back to more fresh food dominated diet, in a day or two I go back to no more burping or farting or stomach discomfort. The next time you do a similar retreat, I recommend cooking every day and noticing the difference. The act of cooking and cleaning the dishes could serve as great practices for mindfulness in daily life. Fresh food during the retread will definitely lead to greater mental clarity as well. I am inspired by your initiative for creating the time and space to have a 2-week self-guided retreat!"

But, if one's morality is strong, i.e. one's actions are such that they only create causes for better future existence whether in this life or after, then one need not worry or hold any fear about any hell whether Buddhist or Christian or Islamic. I know this is easier said than done and I do understand that your fear of Islamic hell stems from the teachings around the consequences of abandoning the religion you were born into. I would only advise you to see this as just an attachment to an idea. What is truly in your control are your actions and these actions will determine your destination. As someone else here posted, keep ensuring noble actions and practicing mindfulness. In any and all religious ideologies, good actions rooted in wisdom, actions that do not harm lead to good outcomes."
