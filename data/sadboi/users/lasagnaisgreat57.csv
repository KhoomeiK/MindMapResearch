NintendoSwitch,fr1p6vb,t3_gm19a9,1589823597.0,i’m so excited for this. especially the sports games. i’ve only had my switch for like a month but the only thing missing for me was something similar to wii sports so i hope this is it!! the other games are gonna be so fun too
ariheads,fr1jfwj,t3_glwxqr,1589820776.0,"same!!! i have never really liked touch it. i just think it’s just a style of song that i don’t like as much as the others. like i am horrible at describing music but i’ve never liked the ones that sound very pop music like?? like god is a woman, why try, breathin, touch it, those types of songs. my favorites are tattooed heart, get well soon, thank u next, rem, better off, and i don’t care. idk there’s just like a certain vibe that all the songs i like and don’t like have. i also tend to not like the max martin ones which is weird because everyone seems to love those lol"
americanidol2,fr1ibyb,t3_gm4fra,1589820229.0,"yeah. i was not rooting for just sam to win and honestly i was a little disappointed, but that was just because all of my favorites this season made it to the top 7 and just sam was the only one who wasn’t a favorite from the beginning. i just happened to not like her performances as much which makes sense because the rest of them were singing styles of music that i listen to all the time and just sam wasn’t. but i still think that she was talented and she deserved the win, idk why so many people are insulting her. at this point everyone who made it this far to the finale was probably deserving of the win lol."
popheads,fqzt7gr,t1_fqzj8d8,1589774803.0,just sam wasn’t my pick to win just because the rest of the top 5 was literally all of my favorites from the season lol but i think she’s good too!! i hope she’s successful after the show. and katy’s performance was so cool
americanidol,fqzibju,t3_glseo4,1589767988.0,i loved francisco. i wish this were a normal season and we got to at least see the top 3

americanidol,fqz9vdo,t1_fqz96sb,1589762924.0,when i was 6 when they called you chicken little i thought it was because you were the voice of chicken little in the movie and i thought it was crazy they got him on american idol

americanidol,fqz7qoh,t1_fqz79mj,1589761636.0,"i feel like i just don’t vibe with her performances the same way that i do the other finalists, but the rest of the top 5 have been my favorites since auditions so it makes sense i guess. i still think she sounded really good though and she deserves to be here"
americanidol,fqz7hjx,t1_fqz7dhw,1589761483.0,ok but honestly if they all sang the same song it would be kinda interesting

Zillennials,fqy52ot,t3_gliym6,1589742715.0,"yeah, as a kid i don’t remember using the internet at all until i was in elementary school or maybe kindergarten. i spent most of my time playing cd rom games on the computer. eventually i got really into flash games and multiplayer stuff online like club penguin and webkinz and disney channel.com, and around that time i would try to sneak onto youtube and watch stuff like nigahiga and all those viral videos but my parents tried to keep me away from it lol. it wasn’t until my first iphone in middle school that i think i started to use the internet every day. i probably just played with toys or played outside or watched tv more than i was on the internet but i still really liked it"
Zillennials,fqw0zmh,t3_gl6mk5,1589689904.0,"mostly early gen z even though a lot of the things i liked weren’t on there. there were also lots of things from late millennial, a lot of shows i watched that were core millennial (mostly the nick cartoons) and a few from early millennial and early gen x but i guess those were just shows that kept being replayed for a really long time. also some core gen z like minecraft and gravity falls and stuff but that was middle school and high school"
TrueOffMyChest,fqvi0iq,t1_fqvcbjy,1589677693.0,i still live with my parents so i’m not ordering food for myself a lot but i always tip 20% or more when i do and people always think i’m crazy. especially right now these people deserve more money for having to deliver food to me lol.
GenZ,fqvg8hs,t3_gl0u9g,1589676616.0,i miss the blue ones they taste so different now
Zillennials,fqvg55r,t3_gkvsns,1589676559.0,yeah i had all this. we didn’t have the colorful imacs but i used to play on them at other schools. the only difference is i had a mix of those projector things and smart boards. i think maybe my school was early with smart boards but in 2nd grade i ended up in the only smart board classroom and by 6th grade almost every room got one so i had one most years.
Sims4,fqu7g40,t1_fqstsnd,1589653494.0,"yeah, i have a family that i’ve been playing in get famous ever since it came out and i love all the gameplay. i love getting them dressed up every week and taking “red carpet” pictures at the awards and giving them stars and all that fun stuff. i just wish the acting career earned more money, since my main family is about to reach their 3rd generation, they’re all the highest fame level and they just now moved into a (very empty bc i couldn’t afford furniture) mansion in the hills neighborhood. and in order to do that i had to open a retail store and have them work almost 24 hours a day reselling selling those expensive violins."
ABraThatFits,fqu5vot,t3_gkr7a7,1589652626.0,"same!! i’ve tried some of the brands from this sub that i’ve found on sale and i have found some bras that fit me perfectly, but victoria’s secret 32D is still pretty much perfect and their bras are the comfiest and best looking. i was measured there once and they happened to measure me at my calculator size which surprised me, maybe i just got lucky with the person i had. but i have so many of their bras and they’re still my favorites."
ClubPenguin,fqspmhy,t3_gknh0a,1589614454.0,i didn’t realize it closed but i remember when it was popular. i probably played it in like 2011 or something. i used to love that i could have any item.
americanidol,fqqceao,t3_gk4ghl,1589563099.0,"yeah, i always end up liking the “teen heartthrob” but Fransisco seems different. i love his singing and him being cute is just a nice bonus. i couldn’t see him in a boy band either."
americanidol,fqoulix,t3_gj67go,1589525330.0,"i’m so bad at remembering induvidual performances after the season is over and there’s probably so many i’m forgetting but reading these comments i’m being reminded of some i liked
dalton rappatoni- bird set free
sam woolf- how to save a life
walker burroughs- lovebug (lmao i just like the jonas brothers)
laine hardy- come together
jeremiah- make you feel my love (i think he sang that?)
ashley hess’s audition from last year
jonny west’s audition

ADHD,fqoi6rj,t3_gjy7og,1589515798.0,now i’m sitting here trying to figure out if i do it this way lmao. i can’t tell. i still count on my fingers a lot (or like imagine myself counting on my fingers) but other than that i have no idea how i do it when i actually try to think about it. i think i add the 10s first and then the other numbers. or maybe not idk
ADHD,fqmebyq,t3_gjjd4l,1589476036.0,yup. it’s weird because i always get good grades on essays so i just assumed i was good enough at writing and didn’t think too much about my excessive commas but once i showed one to my friend before turning it in and he started talking about how my grammar sucked because everything is a run on sentence. oops
americanidol,fqmdtu9,t3_gjhe56,1589475803.0,i was like 7 or something this season and didn’t really pay as close attention to the show as i do now but i was rooting for the chicken little guy. he’s one of the biggest things i remember from earlier seasons of idol lmao
americanidol,fqmdk97,t1_fqkz7x5,1589475676.0,that was HIM?? i knew i’d seen him somewhere lmao
marchingband,fqigwye,t1_fqi4hq0,1589395845.0,"i was in guard and we always had to do this at competitions. i don’t remember if the band did it too but i think they did. it was to not get distracted or like get in the wrong mindset or anything. i never realized other bands would think it was disrespectful though. i think a few other schools did the same thing. other than that we always cheered on the other bands and always said good luck to them, even our competitors."
popheads,fqifot4,t1_fqi1p0r,1589395376.0,yeah i remember my brother showing me that song and it was so catchy but then i showed it to all my friends and they thought it was weird lmao. she got popular so fast
ClubPenguin,fqhxvph,t1_fqh772m,1589386494.0,same!! i was 17 and hanging out with friends every day and at the time i just didn’t really care but now i wish i played before it went away
college,fqhxf64,t3_giweuo,1589386271.0,"this always happens to me. half the time i don’t even know what i’m writing about, and i’ve never considered myself good at writing so i have no idea how i always get As lmao. i’m always surprised when it happens because i always expect them to hate it"
americanidol,fqhwfrk,t3_gizujp,1589385783.0,i don’t really use facebook but last time i was on there a few weeks ago i saw a post from idol and a lot of the comments were rooting for just sam
youngadults,fqgbx8u,t3_giqgoh,1589342466.0,"yeah. like i’m sure things will end up being okay and in a few months i’ll at least be able to see friends and family again but then i read scary sounding articles and i hate it. this was also my last summer in college and i hate that. i know the seasons won’t stop lol but who knows what they’ll be like after i graduate when everyone’s working full time. i wanted to have lots of fun during my last big chunk of free time where all i’m doing is working part time but it looks like i’ll just be staying home. i know we have to do all of this, and i’ve had so many people i know already get the virus so i’ll stay in quarantine as long as i need to. but i just wish this all never happened and everything was normal"
GenZ,fqfwf02,t3_gimbug,1589333035.0,"yup i had almost all of this and the rest of it i wanted. i even had that exact ipod nano. i remember the droid being huge too, i always forget about that"
popheads,fqf4cv0,t1_fqeyof6,1589318514.0,"high school musical and miley’s music was all so good. miley was literally the soundtrack to my childhood, especially her first 2 albums. 7 things, potential breakup song, and also demi lovatos early albums that played on disney all had the same vibe for me lol"
americanidol,fqf1m7a,t3_ghssrc,1589317199.0,i kinda like the ones we have now but i’d like to see maybe ariana grande or miley cyrus. i’m kind of biased because i’m just fans of them but they’re both really talented so i’m sure they’d be good at it. and i know miley was a judge on the voice. i never watched it so i don’t know if she was good but at least she has experience. since ariana is still huge right now i don’t know if that would ever be possible but i’d just like to see her judging lol. also any of the past judges would be cool.
americanidol,fqf10rz,t1_fqbbtd9,1589316915.0,"honestly i could see him being like a 4th judge. i know he sings sometimes but he’s not like a big musician or anything, but i could still see him giving like celebrity insight idk"
Zillennials,fqef8hh,t3_gif17p,1589306565.0,i saw it in theaters and i don’t really remember it at all. i remember my 12 year old self thinking it was kinda boring but looking back at it now it looks like i would like it
ABraThatFits,fqcqmlx,t3_gi149h,1589265763.0,"yup no one believes my bra size. it’s only a 32D too, i’ve tried everything, even taking my bra off (which honestly looks tiny and clearly fits me) and showing it to people. i just don’t talk about it anymore and when people ask my bra size i usually just say i’m like a C which is what i used to wear before i found bras that actually fit. everyone tells me that the boobs should be like, spilling out of the bra for it to fit but mine just don’t do that. i guess i understand why no one believes me so i gave up. i swear the only people who have ever understood my explanation and agreed were literally guys who have no idea how the sizes work lmao"

americanidol,fqakc5h,t3_ghs060,1589220532.0,"oh wow it’s gonna be a top 5, that’s weird. i was hoping it’d get lowered down to 2 by the end or at least 3. but the past idols performing is cool. jordin sparks and lauren alaina were my favorite idol contestants as a kid and i loved their seasons so i’m excited for that. and i loved laine and alejandro last year."
americanidol,fqaj31s,t3_ghjwxd,1589219922.0,"francisco is still my favorite but i like arthur and i think he could win. i don’t understand why so many people seem to not like him either, i thought he was one of the clear front runners from the beginning"

of my majors in college right now is art and i hated taking my drawing classes before i got to doing stuff on the computer because the paper texture was the worst. i use so much lotion all the time too. i’ve never seen anyone else describe it like i do. i also have kind of a similar problem with clothes. i hate collared shirts and literally refuse to wear polos. i don’t think i’ve ever worn one. i’m a girl so i feel like we wear them less anyways, but when i was applying for jobs in high school i avoided any with collared shirt uniforms and everyone thought i was crazy. weirdly i prefer t shirts that are right around the neckline though. like just the plain gildan big t shirts are literally all i wear anymore because they feel the best and they don’t bother me. that or something with practically no sleeves like a tube top or tank top with thin straps."

popheads,fprrb0v,t3_gf0wki,1588860506.0,i was 10 and the summer after this song came out with all the other songs that were released was one of my favorites. i literally loved every single song on the radio and knew the words to everything. me and my brother memorized the rap in this song and thought we were so cool because we could do the rap even though i had no idea what any of the lyrics meant. i loved all of the singles from her first few albums but california gurls brings back the best memories
