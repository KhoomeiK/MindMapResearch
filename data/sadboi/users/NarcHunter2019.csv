CheatedOn,fr2dstf,t3_gm51g3,1589835559.0,"Curious, who did he cheat on you with? 

In my relationship I even went to premarital counseling and he failed. So that was the last straw. 

Everyone has a breaking point. It may not be the point you want to cut him from your life but it'll get there. 

I regret not leaving sooner."
CheatedOn,fr2db3g,t3_gm51g3,1589835318.0,"Been there. Once with a boyfriend  (first love) and a fiancee. 

Once you go back, things wont be the same. 
The resentment is there for a reason and will grow until there is just raw hate. 

Trust is like a mirror. Once you break it into a thousand little pieces, you fix it. You can still see the reflection but it's not the same. 

You'll always second guess him after going back to him. Going back is like wishful thinking. 

You cannot take a skunk, dip it in perfume and hope it acts like a puppy. Its furry and cute but the perfume wears off and you're left with....a skunk. 

Eventually you'll start fantasizing about what it's like without him and be with someone else. 

Pain is there to teach you a lesson. Sure, some hopefuls have worked it out. But, you cant go back to those innocent days where you trusted him in the beginning."

The rape ruined my life. And I'm simply sick of people being really happy and getting married. What did I do to deserve such horrible things and yet people just dont understand.

No shame in deleting social media. It's fake and people live with their heads in the sand. Makes me mad People post social media pictures of kids and dont protect them from predators or criminals!"
CheatedOn,fprdhxa,t3_gf2kb2,1588851064.0,"He's going to deny that he gave you anything. With STD testing it is extremely sensitive information unless he actually shares it with you in person. 

Hes more than likely going to flip it, and say you cheated on him. It's a nice little trick to cause mass confusion. 

You're confused because everything's so perfect and no signs were there. Yes, my ex gave me the best times of my life as well. This is a mind fuck move. Its the honeymoon phase. 

Hes banking on the good times you had as bait to get you back. 

Go and read why does he do that by Lundy Bancroft. Look up the word integrity. 
You have a player on your hands. Just because he comes with the ""I'm sorry"" speech doesnt mean hes changed. Hes seeing how far you'll bend over backwards. 

I doubt hes slept with only two or three people. Men like this rotate women like a pitching staff in a baseball game. They'll never announce that they're seeing someone else. 
Hes too good at doing this. Hes done it before and he'll do it again."

CheatedOn,fo6imun,t3_g5wmq5,1587559756.0,"I was the same way. Always attracting people who needed fixing. 

To be honest, cheaters are all about themselves and feeling good. It's an ego thing and cheaters have big egos that you or I could never fulfill. It's really not about you. It's them filling a need. But not a sexual need, per say. The mind of a cheater is rooted in deep anxiety, pain, fear, hurt. On the outside it doesnt appear like they're hurt. But in reality they weren't born a cheater. It happens after so much damage is done that they literally have no conscious because no one ever gave them what they needed, love, security, stability"

Can you tell Jamie, I said to Amy when I first found out from you when you called that Jamie was pregnant I said to Amy..if Jamie isnt keeping this baby I would adopt to keep the baby in the family....
Can you let Jamie know that I love her...I pray for her/baby neice daily that they stay stong and healthy thru all her sick times.  Can you tell Jamie I'm sorry for what I said months ago!  Can you tell her that I love her and hope one day I can be a part of her life again. Can you tell her...I wish/pray nothing for the best for her/Keifer/and baby--wish them a lifelong loving marriage and prosperous family!
