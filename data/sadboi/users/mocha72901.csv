reactivedogs,fg0gmc7,t1_fg0e467,1580407387.0,Prongs don’t cause discomfort. They allow you to clearly communicate with your dog. They’re actually less harmful than flat collars because it won’t choke your dog or put too much pressure on the front of their neck

She is a low content wolfdog, she does not like excessive training secessions and can only go for about 10 minutes before needing a break. Paying a trainer wouldn’t do much for her that I can’t do on my own because she really only listens to me. 

Before anyone asks, yes she is dog friendly/non reactive, yes she loves people and kids but can stay focused. I had her for over two years before considering her for a service dog prospect. 

So far she’s been doing great! I’ve been working with her for maybe 4 months and she’s already able to be calm and controlled in public even off leash (though I don’t do that often). She’s started to automatically task in public too and I’m so proud of her! She has really changed my life and given me back my freedom. 

Owner training can work! But you must know your dogs limits. Even professionally trained dogs mess up sometimes, just correct them and move on."

I couldn’t pull myself away from it until I found a new FP and realized I didn’t want to deal with her anymore. Long story short I continuously got abandoned by my FP (it felt like I did) and I couldn’t deal with it. I got a dog and started focusing a lot of attention on her. She’s become my FP and I rely heavily on her for validation and my moods. 

She is trained to respond to me and wags her tail when I call her name. She’s always happy to greet me and doesn’t mind if I cry into her fur. She’s never going to leave me either which is superrr comforting. 

I’m a little over attached to her because of this and have a hard time socializing without her."

She had basic obedience and got along well with dogs and humans. She had the calm stable attitude to be SD before I started working with her which helped a lot. All my training with her has been by me (18 not a trainer) and so far she’s done really well! I watch a /lot/ of YouTube videos and read articles from different trainers. I’ve been doing research on dogs for a few years but it’s not impossible to train your own! It did cause me a lot of anxiety though and she still isn’t “finished.” 

Whenever I stand still she leans against my leg to give me constant pressure and if I stand still for too long she whines a bit to say let’s go! She’s also very responsive so if I’m feeling disconnected I can interact with her and she’ll wag her tail to say I heard you XD - That personally helps me and wasn’t exactly something I taught more just how she is! 

I would recommend a dog that’s at least 5 (they mellow by then) and make sure it’s friendly with kids/dogs/ other animals!

I’m suicidal too, having her in my car or just around has really helped me be more cautious because I don’t want anything to happen to her. 

My dog is a high energy breed so I have to exercise her everyday and it’s really helped with depression because I’m forced outside.
