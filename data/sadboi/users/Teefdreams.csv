bipolar,fflsuy1,t3_eu5bnt,1580043769.0,"You definitely need a closer appointment. If it's the meds causing you to be triggered into mania it's just going to keep going and possibly escalating the longer you're on them.

bipolar,fflrct9,t1_fflasjl,1580043178.0,"It sounds exactly like bipolar. The last serious episode I had before diagnosis went from me being completely agoraphobic to going out all the time, suddenly drinking and doing drugs after being completely sober for 5 years, thinking I was doing amazingly well, not sleeping or eating and meeting complete strangers in hotel rooms to tie me up, abuse me and fuck me. What OP describes is almost exactly the same except for maybe the last point. Her friends think she's behaving like a completely different person. And it's come after a change in SSRIs.    
Maybe that's not psychosis serious but what she describes (and is probably leaving out because its humiliating) is a pretty good match for BPII."

Were you in an episode at the time? Were you undiagnosed then?  
There's a lot of questions but I'm just going with it being a brief fling, 3 years ago.  
For me, thinking I'm in a movie like scenario can be a bit of slip into delusion....just something to maybe keep an eye on."

I was admitted again last year because I was going to kill myself and they only had that BPD diagnosis from last time on file. Not bipolar.
