I found that my chest tightness increased when I had any sort of intense emotion, so the microdose on top of my morning coffee made me feel a little uncomfortable at first but when combined with l-theanine, I felt calmer and was able to study normally. 

That being said, I was extremely lucky to only have had a few days of coughing and tightness and since everyone is different, I would probably exercise caution and skip microdosing until you're at least sure your symptoms aren't worsening."

premed,fdscomj,t1_fdsau1i,1578699601.0,"You don’t have to speak the other language to teach ESL, especially since the best way to learn a language is immersion! When I was teaching one on one sessions in Paris I was actually advised not to let my students know that I speak French, and pretend that I don’t understand them when they’re speaking French. Similarly, at the current company I work for, speaking Chinese isn’t a requirement and the teachers who do know a few words are advised not to use them unless absolutely necessary to grab really young children’s attention. It depends a lot on the situation, though, when I taught in Romania my sessions were a lot shorter and with a mixed age group so I had to switch back and forth between English and Romanian to get my points across. There is a lot to gain from teaching ESL, even if you only speak the student’s target language!"
premed,fdiszy1,t3_elkcv3,1578450371.0,"Developing a routine is helping me. I try to wake up at 4:30 every day (I teach starting from 5:30) and be in bed by 8:30-9:00. I try and start my mornings the same way (meditate, shower, coffee) and end the evenings the same way (tea, skincare routine, prepping my teaching space). I stay on top of my sleep, my diet (I try to stay low-carb to avoid blood sugar crashes & feeling sleepy when I'm trying to get things done), exercise. I have people who keep me accountable, and I try to schedule out my time and then stick to the schedule. The keyword here is ""try."" Not every day goes as planned, sometimes I'll have weeks where I have trouble getting out of bed and staying focused, but it's gotten so much better each year so I have high hopes for the future.

premed,f2k5boy,t3_ddjju6,1570281565.0,"Although you might not have the raw cognitive abilities that makes it easier to study and take exams, no one can say you don’t have emotional intelligence. It takes a HIGH level of self-awareness to understand where you are in terms of learning abilities and set a schedule for yourself and then actually stick to it, on top of everything else. This will be super helpful with whatever you end up choosing as a career. 

Maybe you can train yourself to be more cognitively able. I don’t know your brain but there are supplements for cognitive function (source: my mother, a very smart lady, has chronic fatigue syndrome and takes things like GABA and 5 HTP to help with brain fog — ALWAYS CHECK WITH A DOCTOR BEFORE TAKING SUPPLEMENTS THO.) 

The question is, is it worth it? I’m in a similar position as you, except that I seem to have the intelligence but lack the work ethic/ability to motivate myself that are equally necessary to do well on the MCAT and get into medical school (I’m also coming from a non-science field). I ask myself every so often if it’s worth the hardship of waking up at 5am every day and feeling awful on the days I can’t study. 

Thank you for being so vulnerable. It sounds like you have some soul-searching to do, and I wish you luck in whatever career you go into!"
