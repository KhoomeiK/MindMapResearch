Plus online dating is just like trying to get a job online.  Just like employers have their pick when 150 people spam them resumes for each job, women have their pick of men with online dating.  Part of it is simply a lot of the men on the sites (like myself) don't really have social skills or the social capital to cultivate dating relationships from in person social groups.

AskMenOver30,eov88h8,t1_eov2unh,1558890413.0,I have far from figured out life but am more social than I was at 30.  As for the open mic I mostly do poetry but every once in a while do comedy.  Comedy is tough though because it's so easy to offend peope.

I was friendless for years but then found an autism group that was supportive and a good open mic.  With me it was just trial and error.
