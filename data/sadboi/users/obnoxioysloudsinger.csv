Celiac,f6g8k9a,t3_dr7q2u,1572823081.0,I believe it means that it tested below a certain threshold of ppm despite a shared facility.
bipolar,f6g6p9r,t3_dr5fg1,1572822523.0,"I don't think I'm better, just different. There are times when I struggle to get anything at all done. There are times when everything I do is stupid. However, there are also times when I write a quality 50 page paper in a night."
bipolar,f6g14xb,t3_dr5pb9,1572820576.0,"I've done some fucked up shit while manic, and even while depressed. But, I always take responsibility for it. Unless you have a complete break with reality and don't know right from wrong, you are responsible. Even if you don't understand the consequences or think you'll get caught."
bipolar,f6g019f,t3_dqze8y,1572820219.0,"I guess I'm lucky that work is therapy to me. When I'm manic, I direct my energy to work, school work, or side projects to keep myself from going out and doing something I'll regret. When I'm depressed, I work on things to distract myself from my thoughts. But I love my job and what I'm studying so that probably helps."
bipolar,f6fx6xa,t3_dr6tsv,1572819119.0,SSRIs make bipolar worse? That explains a lot. I think I've reached a decent equilibrium now though. When I first started taking Zoloft... Shit was bad.
bipolar,f6fv5zh,t3_dqwl32,1572818438.0,I've had this exact thing happen except before I got in the shower. I ended up not even showering that day.

Celiac,f3n2h6h,t3_dh7zh0,1570994303.0,"Everyone I know was more upset than I was. I was kind of in denial about how hard it would be. Plus I was just happy for an answer. Yeah, a lot of the horror stories about ""glutening"" are true but at least you'll know the cause. I'm still experimenting to see how to best avoid gluten. I am still learning and will be for a while. But, though it is life changing, you will hopefully start to feel better. At least that has been my silver lining."
bipolar,f342fd3,t3_dfgkq1,1570649396.0,"I've recently found myself grateful for a serious physical illness because it lessened my mania in some ways. My mind is still racing, and I can tell from people's reactions that I'm still off, but I don't have the energy to do anything too crazy. A ""normal"" person would never be happy about this. They also would know their limits and not keep making everything worse like I do by over doing it."

migraine,evsgjbc,t1_evs5cyl,1564745493.0,"You're not wrong. But this really isn't what they need to hear right now. The better way for a doctor to say it is ""We need to check out everything. Can you tell me more about your history?"""
migraine,evsge2b,t3_ckx5on,1564745338.0,"Mine was diagnosed when the neurologist was looking for a seizure disorder. They accidentally triggered a bad one. It was bad that I only remember it as blurry and confusing. I was young, around 12, and didn't have a clue that my headaches were migraines. Getting diagnosed early and turning out not to have a seizure disorder was a blessing in disguise. The point is, you shouldn't have to set up an appointment specifically for diagnosis. If you happen to have one if front of a doctor or nurse, they should know."

bipolar,es7rmde,t3_c6afjk,1561677970.0,Maybe you guys can tell me if you think this is my bipolar or just me being stupid: I'm pretty sure I've already been with my soulmate but we broke up due to extenuating circumstances. Now I just accept that the happiest part of my life is over and go on way too many dates. I always miss him but am compelled to date a bunch of guys knowing that I'll never love them. My mom says I'm wreckless with them but I don't feel like I am at all.
bipolar,es7nyuh,t3_c6aa9m,1561675246.0,Too real.

Just make sure to still try to have fun and go to the activities where people will be drinking. If they do pressure you into a drink, match or double with water."
