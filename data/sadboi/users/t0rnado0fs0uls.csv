Ever since I was smol, if I was alone, I'd whisper practice how I'd respond to certain questions, situations, etc. But as a kid I came up with some pretty outlandish situations I expected I might find myself in so my scripts werent super helpful til I was older and had more life experience. 

I'm 30 now, and I'd say only 15% of my hypothetical conversations are outlandish and that's pure anxiety hahaha. 

I'm sure ppl have been mean about how long it takes you to process and respond so I wanna stress that you're not broken you're just different and you still deserve kindness from people. 

I find I parse conversations better if I'm not making eye contact. Which means explaining that I'm looking elsewhere so I can parse better, not because I'm bored or disinterested. Telling people this upfront has been helpful, especially because I'm right. I Do parse better when I'm not also fielding lots of nonverbal facial cues, very distracting."

I have a pervasive developmental disability and my only comment is that we really dont like how neurotypical ppl give us a mental age it's like not being a person. It's one thing if I myself say I'm a 22 year old in a 30 year old body, and quite another when other ppl say it. 

My only other comment is yes CPS should he involved. Not that theyll do much. They never did anything to stop the grownups who were hirting me as a kid but maybe you'll get a caseworker who gives a shit.

I'm aware of my typoes typing is hard sometimes."

nintendo,f8qzdq4,t3_e1ftwu,1574728053.0,"I have a king boo tattoo and a Luigi with his poltergust tattoo, I'm gonna get E. Gadd next. I heckin LOVE Luigi's Mansion 3 (and the first 2) they did basically everything right cept for that low health notification sound. 

My Luigi tat is a watercolor, the artist did such a n amazing job making him look scared, that's what I love about Luigi, dude is scared shitless and does that stop him? Nah, he keeps going! That ain't being a coward! That's the definition of bravery, being scared yet acting anyway. That's love, that's dedication! And they way they animated him being so terrified is amazingly hilarious to me, so much detail was put into these games.

And the sheer amount of stuff you can suck up with the poltergust is so satisfying. The ability to body slam ghosts is so amusing. I could gush about this game for so long. 

In the beginning of the game when you're taking E. Gadd back to the garage, a ghost scares luigi and e. Gadd laughs at him, so my tat of him is gonna be him pointing at my terrified luigi and laughing"

They really do gang up on new parents and take advantage of how sleep deprived and exhausted we are from laboring and delivering. That's not consent that's coercion, you saw it was coercive and put your foot down. You recognized your wife's defenses were down because her lack of meds and you made her No louder.

AskReddit,f8gak6q,t3_e0har9,1574556557.0,"I want people to know that they tell on themselves when they're surprised someone is autistic. (Means ya know nothing jon snow) You tell on yourself when you guess that I'm high functioning (functioning levels arent real, but if they were, when you say this crap I designate you as low functioning) 

I want you to know the 35 hours you spent in college learning about us will never equal my 30 years of first hand experience, to quote Ron Swanson from Parks n Rec: ""I know more than you"". (Delayed echolalia is when you repeat something you heard or read in the past, and everytime you use a meme you're using echolalia so stop being jerks to us we created this, memes are autistic culture)

I need yall to understand that yall talk a lot of shit about us for folks who'd still be using candles if not for autistic badasses like Henry Cavendish (Ohm's Law) (Source: neurotribes the legacy of autism by steve silberman) 

Folks need to learn that quiet hands, and attempts to extinguish stereotypies/stims/repetitive movements, is abusive, our brains make us move the way we do for a reason, my stims are regulatory and communicative. If yall insist on using harsh environmental stuff like florescent lights, I gotta rock side to side so I can process what's going on. But yall train us to stop doing this then wonder why we keep regressing, losing skills, or becoming burnt out. And all of it could be avoided if ya stopped making guesses and just asked those of us who are more than eager to help. 

I'm eager to help because maybe my brash way of saying things keeps some other kid from being hurt. As a kid I didnt have words for this shit I could barely keep up with what was happening around me and was constantly in trouble for lord knows what. Folks would say ""you know what you did"" and like nah. No idea. I just internalized that I must be some kind of monster. 

Oh and the idea that we lack theory of mind, when in truth we have a different operating system, is used to justify horrific treatment for example they still use shock equipment on autistic children at the Judge Rotenberg Center. 

And if you think Gay Conversion Therapy is bad, wait til you find out that Ivar Lovaas invented that AND Applied Behavioral Analysis. So if we could keep that same ""Ban Conversion Therapy"" energy when it comes to ABA that'd be great. 

I wont entertain any bcbas who wanna argue with me I'm a survivor you dont get to defend your practice, operant conditioning, discreet trial training, all of it is akin to dog training because we arent people to you lot. And it shows.

Yall get taught to hate people like us real early and it doesnt even require knowing that we are autistic. That kid who never shuts up about that one thing they're really into? Yeah I see yall making fun. Or the idea that lacking eye contact means we ain't listening or means we ain't trustworthy? Furthermore: the idea that we lack empathy is really fucking funny when compassion is a choice, that non-autistic people frequently DON'T make. I mean it's why is being socially ostracized is the norm, not the exception. 

It's why people can murder their autistic relatives and the comment section of every online news report is riddled with ""well, they (autistic people) ARE hard to take care of I dont blame that person for doing a murder"" and then yall copy cat each other over and over. 


I need yall to know we dont shriek for the hell of it, behavior is communication, behavior is communication, behavior is communication, and my bluntness is directly tied to decades worth of rejection and internalized shame, thinking I must be broke, but it ain't me whose broke. I refuse to keep hiding what makes me delightfully autistic. I ain't scared to flap my hands and it makes me cackle in mirth how fragile people are about that. 

<content warning: child abuse>
Oh and if I could transfer what I relive when people say the R slur, I would. Maybe youd keep it outta your mouth if it was you suddenly back in the 90s, being picked up by your hair, and thrown into furniture as he tells you no one will hire a r*t*rd. 
<end content warning>

My memory reel begins real early (age 1.5) and I've been observing allistics, (folks lacking autism), yall ain't very nice. Y'ain't kind. And me making ppl feel bad by speaking the truth will never compare to the hatred I've endured."

Him calling me a r*t*rd plays in my head all the time and so I try to remind myself that I'm not trash, or deserving of death, just for being neurodivergent. But yeah, fucking mood. Most of my suicide attempts stem from loathing my inability to get anything done in a timely manner.

AutisticPride,f89qj0g,t1_f89p5l0,1574377840.0,"Major Depression is an illness in the brain that eventually kills people, it stands alone or is paired with other illnesses. When it is paired with another illness we say ""comorbid"". 

For example: I am autistic with comorbid ADHD, anorexia (an OCD spectrum disorder), and a bunch of other things I dont care to list. I am neurodivergent.

Another example: an allistic (non-autistic) with agoraphobia (intense anxiety that makes leaving your own house very difficult) and epilepsy. They would also be neurodivergent. Their neurodivergence comes from the agoraphobia and epilepsy. (The agoraphobia might come from a fear of seizing in public because people are cruel)
