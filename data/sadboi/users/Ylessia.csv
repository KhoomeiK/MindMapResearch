What if he texted you first, OP, and got a bad feeling when he saw the message didn‚Äôt deliver? Even if you not responding wasn‚Äôt that uncommon, a message being undelivered is generally strange when it happens for an extended period of time. So he thought of an excuse to come check on you, remembering the conversation about the Pok√©mon cards, and bought them to come and give to you. Maybe? 

Either way, I‚Äôm sure he knew, and I agree with the others here. You guys deserve each other, deserve happiness and love. This story is so amazing and wonderful, and brought me to tears. Thank you for sharing!"

Truly inspiring the moral dilemma of granting their last wish as effectively as possible given the circumstances, even with having to ‚Äúlie‚Äù about her death, or telling the truth and letting everyone live with the harsh and horrible reality. 

Sometimes, there is no ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúmorally correct‚Äù answer. The truth could have broken any of those who cared for her, more than letting them find comfort in the fantasy."
venting,fho689p,t1_fho3wzu,1581742839.0,"Thank you so much, and it‚Äôs okay. What we experience in life becomes a part of us in so many ways, and allows us to better empathize so no apology needed! I am 25 years old as of this past October. I never quite know how to define my mother. She can be very supportive every once in a while, and it always draws me back in. Especially when I finally think I‚Äôm just so done with her. I want to love her and care for her, especially because she‚Äôs my mother AND my father would want her to be cared for. Even if we never got along, he loved her dearly and thought she was worth caring for. My love for my father dictates that, regardless of my opinion, I want to work to honor his wishes as well. He was very good to me, always. I miss him a lot, and am still grieving his death 2 years later which adds a lot to my stress/depression levels. But in general, the way most people react upon seeing conversations between us, people always tell me that she‚Äôs incredibly toxic and controlling and I need to get away from her sooner than later. I just wish it were more feasible. Losing the life we had built, even though it was just a small apartment and a secondhand car, really took its toll on my psyche I think.

Anyways, sorry for rambling. I wish you all the best in life, you deserve it. And I hope that the good days where your arthritis isn‚Äôt so bad will always outnumber the bad days, that is my wish for you. All the best. x"

As for my kid, I don‚Äôt think anyone gave our son a hard time for not sleeping except my mother who then gave us a hard time for trying to get him to nap a little later after he calmed down.

But thank you for the affirmation that I‚Äôm just an idiot and a piece of crap. I‚Äôll keep that with me.

Edit: also, he has his own bedroom. This was one time this morning to try and get him to sleep better."

AskReddit,fdjd7pw,t3_eld4mi,1578466013.0,"I got called to the principal‚Äôs office because I had too many fly-always. 

I have very long, thick, curly hair. In the winter, I tend to get a lot of fly-always due to static electricity. Apparently someone told my principal that my hair seemed too ‚Äúfrizzy‚Äù. 

Me, being the fearless 17 y/o that I was, asked him if it was one of my teachers. He immediately became flustered and sputtered something about ‚ÄúI can only disclose that information with those directly involved in the situation‚Äù to which I also replied ‚ÄúThis situation is literally about me, or my hair, which means I‚Äôm involved in this.‚Äù 

He basically told me to forget about the whole thing and just go back to class.


To clarify as to why I immediately thought it would be her, the teacher I mentioned was married to another teacher whose family donated lots of money to the school. She wore skin-tight pencil dresses almost every day, high heels she literally bounced in when she walked (whilst making very little forward progress), and had her hair regularly dyed an unnatural black. She proudly claimed to have taught her college trigonometry class, because their teacher was out most of the time due to pregnancy? She would sit in class and project her shopping for shoes and purses online onto the projector screen while we worked on our assignments. And she got caught shagging the cheerleading team‚Äôs tumbling coach in the locker room in school grounds, but didn‚Äôt even get so much as suspended from work. She also, unfortunately, happened to be the cheerleading coach as well as my math teacher. She was obsessive to the tiniest detail about appearances and never seemed to like me for some reason. I wasn‚Äôt ever particularly singled out, but she and I had several tense interactions; down to me asking her a question about the assignment and her saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, just look in the back of the book.‚Äù (She regularly admitted in class that she was ‚Äúteaching out of the back of the book‚Äù most of the time.)"
