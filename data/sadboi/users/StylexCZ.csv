Not all animal species have the same levels intelligence and cognitive abilities, you picked a random one that dogs have higher than other animals (assuming you're right).

And by using that logic it should be okay to kill cats, because they're not as social as dogs, or pigs for that matter. 
The whole point of this topic is to show that there are no ""reasonable"" justifications for killing animals like pigs, but loving animals like dogs. It's all about the culture you were born into that taught you to love one and kill the other without us ever questioning it."
