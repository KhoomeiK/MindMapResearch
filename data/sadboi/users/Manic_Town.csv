The question we have to ask ourselves as an American society is this, 

""Will we use this crisis as an opportunity to shift the focus of our priorities as a society?""

Yes, agreed, a lot of it does come from the post-left. I also agree on Goldman. My contention is the individualism of the Stirnerists and the post-left is just outright toxic and dangerous. 

The most useful critiques the post-left provides, like you say, to me, are workerism and party politics. I also think there's some credence to organizationalism.

I don't agree that ideology is necessarily bad and I contend that it's really inescapable (the very tools the post-left use to negate ideology are an ideologies in and of themselves). I do believe, however, that the post-left does fall prey to absolutism and their critiques are often shallow and based on sweeping generalizations."
