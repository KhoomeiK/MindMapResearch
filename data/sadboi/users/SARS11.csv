I think at the time I was 18, and my sister is 4 years older than me. We were like ""Uh....not here with the school."" It was just ridiculous because I'm pretty sure it was a school that went up to grade 6.

I'll definitely try doing it more slowly next time we switch proteins.

Hmm I did actually save the pit and take a picture of it in case my vet wanted to see it, it had to have been a pit of some sort. Can't think of anything else it would be there's no way I wouldn't notice a chunk that big in her food (she's a princess and I cut it up for her haha) She must have picked it up outside or something.
