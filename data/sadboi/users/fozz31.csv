You're terrified until you die. Unlike CO2 poisoning alone, drowing also brings the excruciating pain of water in your lungs. It is NOT a good way to go.

People need to stop perpetuating the ""euphoria"" myth.

When you die and your brain realizes whats going on, it brain releases all of its DMT stores and you spend what may feel like an eternity living out all sorts of bizarre things. Maybe if you believe in heaven for a brief moment you are there before you end up existing. This happens with every death (that I know of) resulting from a failure in homeostasis. The journey to that point however can be excruciating and terrifying, which can in turn affect the trip. IF you're scared / terrified instead of a serene blissful trip you're more likely to have a bad / horrifying one. You might buy into the suicide is a mortal sin shit at the very last moments and end up in a DMT induced trip to hell.

a quote from one of many near death drowning experiences

>I did not need to be resuscitated. I fell through a partially frozen swamp/lake side while camping with my family as a kid. I took in a fair ammount of water. I did not know how to swim at the time and the only thing that saved my ass was a barely floating log. Good thing I was close to the people on the bank who saw and heard me. My pops came in after me and my mom was right behind him. I don't remember euphoria, but I sure as hell remeber panic. And the water was so cold it burned. I still sometimes wake up dreaming about damn near drowning and it was more than 20 years ago.

non of the accounts i've read include euphoria, some mention a sudden clarity of having accepted their death but not euphoria, but if you're going to commit suicide you've already accepted your death. so nothing new is going to happen there."

Contact something like dignitas. They can help you do it as safely as it can possibly be and will also help you assess your best options. For example, having a sore leg doesn't mean you amputate it because it feels like in might be gangrene.

The picture also compares different images, the first is a 3D reconstruction with 3D reconstructed clouds, these reconstructions are done by taking each of the 1000's of slices that are taken and stiching them together to form a 3D model. The second picture is a single slice of some other scan. The third is potentially a 3D composit which includes the second. 

Either way this image is 100% bogus."

So why not build resentment against china, likening the ""china virus"" to being worse than 9/11 when it starts dying down then trumping up (if you'll pardon the pun) charges against the china that imply attacks on their part to then be able to 

1. go to war
2. have residual china virus resentment quell concerns / outcry from being as bad.

worldnews,fnj56iv,t1_fnj2ft4,1586992175.0,"the null hypothesis tells us that the outcomes between groups who receive treatment and those who don't are more likely to be the same than they are to be different. 

The alternative hypothesis states that some difference exists.



Weather this difference is of any clinical significance or not is a different question, statistical difference means a systematic difference in outcomes, but that difference might be 1 in a billion people, given the study sizes we're not going to detect such a small difference but you get my point im sure. 



Clinical significance is an incredibly important aspect of all of this. Even if a significant difference exists it may still be more dangerous to take the medication than it is to go without. This is why we need to wait for studies to conclude before we start feeding everyone an immune suppressant. 



So this study indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the idea that there is no difference. It doesn't prove that there is no difference, it just means there is insufficient evidence in the data analysed that there is a difference in this study."
RStudio,fnj45yy,t3_g20p9v,1586991621.0,"as turb0mint said, you have more x than y values or the other way around.

if you put in

    length(tenesseetree$T_OB_D_BH)
and

     length(resid(slr))

how many entries does each have? How many are expected in each case? this might help you hunt down the issue. 


Also as a general tip, within the brackets of a function, you can press enter after each comma to put each variable on its own line. It makes it much easier to see whats going on in the function and makes it easier for people like us to see what it is you've done, so:
    
    plot(tenneseeetree$ST_OB_D_BH,
           resid(slr),
           xlab=""DBH (in)"",

DivinityOriginalSin,fnc3hav,t1_fnc20ct,1586827827.0,"that is a fair point, though i'd argue having a broad range of elemental damages at your disposal means better control of shields. Elemental resistances apply before magic Armour meaning it can be very hard indeed to wipe it out with the wrong skills, but with the right perks and attention to detail you can drop even a massive magic shield in a single turn. Though this usually means other things go unattended to, so then the question becomes is the CC going to help me more in the long run? 

Take the drift wood arena, at a certain fight it becomes essential to CC one, preferably positioning and maneuvering the two so that you aren't fighting on two fronts, rather a certain piece of shit is perpetually between you and the indiscriminate foe or CC'd sometimes both.

Other-times enemies straight up don't have one or the other armor, or maybe they have very very little. So little that a single chloroform will take out sufficient armor to both wipe it and apply sleep."
DivinityOriginalSin,fnc1i1r,t1_fnby7bw,1586826652.0,"?? you just need to wipe out the relevant armor? Which for some fights sure, it means the target it almost dead but in others its worth everything.

its also worth burning down armor on a creature applying the CC before they can bolster their armor on their turn, giving you an entire party a round of free access to their health. 

It's different for sure, but I think its a better system. It does take getting used to though and it doesn't feel nice to have to develop entirely new strategies to account for these changes, but thats also half the fun. Different combat system means it theres more to learn and adapt to.

Learning and adapting to the combat in DOS1 was half the fun for me."
bipolar_irl,fnbd3q8,t3_g08wcm,1586813404.0,"That's incredibly hard, my heart goes out to you :(

It's possible to be intimate and loving without sex. For the person in the relationship who wants sex, they will obviously still want it because it's not the same as masturbation but it really does take the sting out of it.

Me and my partner have similar issues, she is rarely sexual, maybe 2, 3 times a year. We cuddle naked a lot and share plenty of physical affection like snuggles and kisses which helps the feeling loved thing a lot. I'm very sexual and when I'm hypomanic I'm hyper sexual.  

At the end of the day open honest communication got us through it, it that doesn't work privately because feelings are getting hurt or other breakdowns in communication a relationship therapist can help heaps."
