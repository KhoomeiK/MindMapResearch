AutoZone,fmmpv11,t3_fue0l9,1586209806.0,I had put my sticker between my name and the autozone logo and my SM made me move it to wear its hanging off the bottom. It’s looks so gross down there
MechanicAdvice,fl7d1qc,t1_fl6s0yx,1584899236.0,Autozone has a loan tool service and most of them should carry the UV detection kit. You just have to buy the UV oil additive separate.  (Wow I’m talking about work on my day off)
medical_advice,fl6h6tt,t1_fl6gpce,1584868701.0,It might not be something big. Maybe an accumulation of things or perhaps another mental ailment that could explain this
medical_advice,fl6gbe8,t3_fmwmui,1584867553.0,Seems like almost a PTSD response. I think you should find a therapist.

medical_advice,fjxqei0,t3_ffd3iw,1583680856.0,Make sure that you put enough pressure to keep the two sides of the wound together. So those “butterfly bandaids” would be best for keeping it closed and then cover with a bigger bandaid if it’s still causing you problems. Don’t use hydrogen peroxide because that kills all good things too. Please get help for the self harm to not further risk your future.

BPD,ezodd5e,t3_d1mfne,1568020669.0,Its so hard to date with how we feel. I understand completely. I have ruined perfectly good things because people will say “you can be honest with me.” And when I bring them fears of being ghosted. They get cold feet. And then I get upset. Thinking “I could have been perfect for you and you left me? How dare you!” But I can’t change how the other person feels and it just turns out; they’re not the right person for me.  Take the experience and keep trekking on. I know it’s hard but I’m glad you got this out!

BPD,eyhx4r8,t3_cwytkx,1567094059.0,I hate this feeling so much because I’m very clingy and overly attached and I will literally get sick over fighting with myself whether or not to text again or something. I’ll sit there and just internally argue with myself
BPD,ey7mgrq,t3_cvzitl,1566889696.0,Let yourself be sad. Feel it. Acknowledge it. But don’t let it consume you. Give yourself a deadline for how long you want to feel sad and then distract yourself from it until you are ready to allow yourself to come back with a clear mind.
BPD,ey7meet,t3_cvtaky,1566889609.0,I have felt like this today and I reached out to someone and I’m glad you are reaching out to us.  See. I know I won’t do it. I know that I done want to do it. But it’s the feeling where. I don’t want to be here anymore and it’s so scary! Because when the feeling is gone you just sit there thinking about how intense it was and that’s scary too! My PMs are already open!

BPD,ey656gp,t3_cvq5ho,1566847679.0,You’re not alone. Like I can’t understand why I get into relationships that I don’t want to be in just because I feel like I could make them my “perfect” person and it sucks because I don’t want to change who I’m with but I change myself for whoever I’m with and ahhh it’s so hard yeah

BPD,exg9qsu,t3_csp4kj,1566258648.0,Honestly the best thing for you to do is tell him how it makes you feel and if he is still dismissive; he’s not as good as you think he is. I went through this too. I thought he was super great and he just didn’t get it but he did and it made me feel like shit and he didn’t actually care. It’s easier to see in hindsight
BPD,exg9ebq,t3_csi4sk,1566258428.0,I’m okay as long as it’s like one noise.  If there are too many things going on; I get way too overwhelmed. But if I’m at a concert or my fair radio is up all the way; I’m fine.

relationships,ex8y2ml,t1_ex79j85,1566080472.0,The morning and night texts were something that we would do as we started texting so it didn’t seem out of the ordinary to me especially since it was literally all I would say. Just “g’morning” “g’night”  but thank you for letting me know

relationships,ex764xs,t1_ex66fl5,1566056484.0,Well we met on a dating app so we started out with lots and lots of texts and slowly it just dried up which is why it’s hard because he seemed to do a complete 180
BPD,ex5zyly,t3_crhw0x,1566035921.0,This feeling sucks when you know it’s happening and you can’t shake it. Especially early on in the dating scene when you don’t want to scare them off.
