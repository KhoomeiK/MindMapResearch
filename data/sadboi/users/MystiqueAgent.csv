Pretty much everything that is dangerous is taken out of the room and any room my wife and I frequent ( Like living, dining room and in the kitchen ). We've tried a few fresh stuff ( due in part to the bunny we have ) and so far only little bits and pieces taken, but hey trial and error to see what she likes! Thanks for telling me about the back as well! Don't think I came across that and I've generally just been scratching behind her head a bit, and I believe I rubbed her back once or twice but I will put a stop to that. So from all the things I've read so far we are in good standing! Thank you very much for the information and if any questions arise I'll be sure to do so!"
cockatiel,fc7nskp,t1_fc5yuve,1577513690.0,"Funny you should post that I was reading through that site all last night.

So far I think we have been alright, but thinking I may get one just to be on the safe side. Also was wondering if maybe we should play a little bit of radio while at work just to give her something to listen to while gone."
cockatiel,fc7np2i,t1_fc749oh,1577513583.0,"Thank you and yeah we started to do that a bit each day ( save for Christmas as she didn't sleep much till later that night ), but so far I think she's grown quite used to things in the house now."
cockatiel,fc7nn6k,t1_fc74ifd,1577513525.0,Ouch! I'll keep that in mind just in case one appears that it may be a possibility she may play with it. We are still discovering what toys she can play with and so far she's been having a blast with some of the toys in her cage.

Garmin,fc4nuw1,t1_fc40f7m,1577422286.0,"Same here! It's actually what I was hoping to get out of the Vivoactive and was supposed to have 7 days battery life. I charged my watch at let's say 13:00 today, it's now 23:50 and I'm at 72%. I haven't done anything other than go to work and drive home today. Kind of disappointed at times just how fast the battery life goes :(."

Garmin,fc3s2ff,t1_fc3p9tb,1577397192.0,"Oh. My. God. Thank you! This was a perfect break down. Currently at work and on my phone so I couldn't do comparisons but this is definitely what I was trying to get to. I'll have to check DC rainmakers. I only was able to watch DesFits video this morning on the instinct, but again thank you, thank you, thank you!! Going to go read over the links now."
Garmin,fc3jn5v,t1_fc34qct,1577391260.0,Sorry to double reply but after looking at some 45 features I now feel torn lol. Do you know by chance if that is durable as well?
Garmin,fc3fna6,t1_fc34qct,1577388749.0,Ah okay thanks for the clarification! I dont think I need a fenix just yet. Plus way out of my budget at least for a couple years lol. I wasnt sure about the forerunner 45 i honestly thought it was more old and out of date. I'll have to read and watch some reviews on it. I really haven't used much of the vo2 max to be honest and have just been looking for something for runs and trails with a tad better battery life than what I have with the vivo. Not to mention durable
Garmin,fc30vjo,t1_fc2grj9,1577378904.0,"It sure does thank you! Darn about the GPS because I was starting to notice that it was taking a while at times for it to get a lock on, but I could certainly go without the IQ store and all that. That ruggedness is what I definitely need though. I thought the Vivoactive would have been alright with my job and I surely was wrong on that one. So figured I could use a watch like that. After doing a comparison on the website I figured it would be alright for things I do and are starting to do, just didn't know if it would actually stand up to the test of time and usage. 

Thank you for the input though! Helps quite a bit!"
Garmin,fc30fl4,t1_fc2l61u,1577378620.0,"Thank you for the input, sadly I only have the option of Fenix, Forerunner 45 ( and 45S ) and of course the instinct. When you say deletes FirstBeat metrics about how often would you say it does that?"
Garmin,fc2zzkq,t1_fc2eug6,1577378334.0,Thank you! That actually sounds a lot better than what I do. That lose of 20-30% is just from my normal day and if I exercise and end up using the GPS on a trail run or something then I lose a bit more. Overall this is sounding a lot better. So thanks a bunch!
Garmin,fc254zj,t1_fc23fvy,1577340850.0,Thank you! Guess I'll be getting the watch pretty soon and hanging up the Vivo or handing it off to a friend.
Garmin,fc24ugr,t1_fc22tac,1577340490.0,Thank you! Battery life is a key thing ( next to how durable it is ) I've noticed my Vivo loses like 20-30% battery life per day so sounds like the instinct will be perfect!

Garmin,f1o5tgm,t1_f1o10nn,1569635435.0,Aack! See I didnt have this problem from the beginning. It seems like each update caused a bit more of an issue. Yeah I ended up turning off stairs on garmin connect lol.
Garmin,f1nr4pq,t1_f1nm1i7,1569624057.0,"Sure! Lately I've noticed casually walking it started counting it as climbing stairs. So by the end of the day I've climbed about 10 flights of stairs or so when I've just literally walked around a store lol. When I actually get a chance to run it does it as well just at a faster pace.

 I had some issues with the  battery life, in the beginning it seemed to last alright and generally in the morning before work I charge it. I could be at 100% and some days when I get home I could be at 40 or so. Only notices that a few times though. 

I don't use anything fancy really like it's never paired to my phone and the screen is only at 30 or 40 % I think. So pretty much basic fitness watch, but despite these since I don't or rather can't do too much I figured it wouldn't be worthwhile to upgrade yet.

Oh another issue I've seen is heart rate being in the 120s despite in the past a casual walk for me maybe moves me up to 70 or 80  so I was all sorts of confused then again I did stop all my caffeine intake so that may be a possibility?"
