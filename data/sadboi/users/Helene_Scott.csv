It’s really a liberating thing to not even consider a period. Just think, hormonal issues are lowered, cramps are few, feminine hygiene product purchases are light. I have fibroid problems so would go through at least one heavy duty tampon an hour, for several days (maybe that’s too much info, but fuck it, that’s my reality). I’m really lucky I had the chance to be seen at the Mayo Clinic by one of the best fibroid docs. My Gyno at home wanted to give me a full hysterectomy at age 36. Yeah, I didn’t want kids, but that messes with your life in huge ways by putting you into early menopause. So fuck docs who don’t listen to their patients or want to do the easy thing because they don’t want to be bothered with the actual issue. Well wishes to you in the future!"
