It's never going to be perfect, so it was either try to accept it and do my best to be healthy, or live my life feeling like I had a radio on in my head constantly blaring out the problems with my body. Think of someone who loves you. Do they care if you have dry elbows? I'm guessing they don't and they'd still love you even if they were the driest elbows in the world. 

I also found that when I worked on the acceptance, I was more calm and clear headed and able to make better decisions and find products and lifestyle changes that helped me the most."

Even if its something like a funny movie already picked out and a cupcake. That way you know you will feel a moment of relief once the day is done. When I was having a hard time a few years ago I would call my brother before going to work, someone who will listen and care and make you smile. That might help you remember some positive things about life. Best of luck to you and remember that right now is a hard time and it is understandable to not feel cheery all the time."

relationship_advice,fdn02gg,t1_fdka8wm,1578573022.0,Thank you that’s a helpful perspective and makes me relax a bit
relationship_advice,fdk4cld,t1_fdjz5s9,1578495746.0,I see what the original comment is saying. I imagine all the endless possibilities he has for how he could spend his time and it’s challenging to see him not use that opportunity
relationship_advice,fdk3z8m,t1_fdjzcxz,1578495490.0,"Its a deal breaker if in ten years he’s in the same routine. I just have no way of knowing. 
I’ve tried talking to him but I mentioned in a comment above he tends to shut me out. Yesterday I was like how are you doing, you’ve been in this routine for a while I wanted to check in if somethings holding you back or where you’re at. And essentially he says not to worry about it, he’s fine and will figure out his life on his own. Communicating with him can be difficult. I love sharing everything and he tends to bottle it up and prefers no one is worried about what he’s doing"
relationship_advice,fdk3os0,t1_fdjtrip,1578495290.0,"Yeah he does feel like shit for sure sometimes. When people ask him what he’s been up to he gets frazzled and I can tell he feels a bit embarrassed. His mom does that actually, helps run an animal shelter and she loves it. 
I think you’re right he needs physical stimulation. I know he feels great after we go on a bike ride or actually make it out to do something he’s always happy he went but it’s hard to get him to go. I try and motivate him but he in the end will only do it when it comes from his own desire to move forward. 

I guess now what I need is advice on talking to him. He tends to shut me out and say he’s going to figure it out on his own, not to worry about it, he’s fine. He’s sensitive and I think he feels like I’m grilling him or it makes him feel bad when I bring up the fact that he’s been stuck in this routine for a while,  when I’m really just trying to help."
relationship_advice,fdk35an,t1_fdjtohq,1578494913.0,"I’ve known what I wanted to do since I was 12. I love my jobs, I work in creative environments and am challenged, I get to make things, work in the arts, and am constantly inspired and motivated by the people I meet while working. It’s a huge part of my identity and even if I end up marry him I will continue to create and work. I know I’m in a great situation but when I come home and have a million things to say of what I learned or experienced at work and he’s like ya I’ve been chilling all day I get frustrated . It’s not that I’m upset that I have to work because I love that."
