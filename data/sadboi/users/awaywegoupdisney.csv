mentalhealth,f698cvc,t3_dqmnft,1572737967.0,"Ask what kind of thoughts they have, if they’re going to kill themselves (outright) and if they have a plan. 

If it is simply a “passing thought” or something, they probably are low risk. 

If it is something like, I wonder what my family will feel if I die, I wonder what it’s like to die, I wonder if I’d ever kill myself ect., this is caked suicidal ideation, and they are simply “at risk”. Keep an eye on them.

If they have a plan and the means to, but says they are not going to do it, they are at high risk. 

Severe risk is if they have a plan, the means to do it, suicidal ideation and say they WILL do it. 

It helps to eat your local number for mental health services, rather than the national hotline. I think they can actually do more for you. 


Additionally, ask if they have plans in the future (like graduation, job they want to take, a vacation), ask them about hobbies, and if they’ve dropped any recently, ask them about if they have anything they care about. Honestly, just ask about their life, especially if you know them. But above all, do what you think you *can* do. You’re doing your best, and nobody is going to damn you for doing so."

You feel like you’re just going to disappoint people, *which isn’t true*. It seems like you’re so preoccupied on the future disappointment you feel WILL happen (fortune telling) and psyche yourself out of any potential relationship. You’re being very critical of yourself because you’re afraid of disappointment, and because you aren’t interacting with women. I don’t have a lot experience in this field, but I say go for it. 

If you do disappoint someone, ask yourself “what then? What will I do after that?” And typically, the answer is move on. It’s like a roller coaster. The anticipation of getting on is a lot scarier than the actual ride.

 I also understand that you’ve realize that you have acted the same was as a “light racist”, correct? 

Congrats! I don’t mean this in a demeaning way, I mean this genuinely. What you are describing is “cognitive dissonance”. It happens because the brain wants to take the path of least resistance. That is why bad habits are hard to break, and it’s completely human. You have also acknowledged that changing this about yourself will result in a loss of identify(?) for you. A lot of people deny arguments or concept’s existing because they feel personally attacked, and all the “bad things” that come with being a “racist” will suddenly apply to you. 

And that’s okay! 

This is a completely human response, and I say this as a black person. I don’t believe that anger or guilt is a productive emotion. Yes, we need to feel them, but if someone is racist or discriminatory or whatever, I want them to be different, not to hate themselves and bare the guilt like a cross. 

Lean into this feeling. Acknowledge and accept all the new things that come with it. It will be okay. I believe that everyone is subconsciously trying to reach the point of self-actualization, but the way we get there is wildly different.

If you change, great! If you don’t, whatever. You may change later, or you might die the way you are. Oh, well. 

Thanks for taking the time to post."
mentalhealth,f65wqpo,t3_dqgkao,1572705913.0,"You don’t owe anyone forgiveness. Don’t try to “force yourself” to do shit. You focus on you and your healing, and the anger will go away in time.

The reason people say this is because there is some truth in anger being unproductive and harmful. I’m going to use the example of my friends break-up.

He’s angry at his ex for manipulating and abusing him. It wasn’t his fault, and even though it’s over, it still hurts. He’s angry because anger is the way or brains us that something is wrong, and we’re not being treated the “right way”. 

He’s angry because he need to feel angry so that all his insecurities don’t surface. Deep down, he feels like she was right about him. He was worthless, useless, a horrible person, and acknowledging that grief feels Ike he’s damning himself. So he feels angry because deep down he’s sad that someone he loved betrays them.

He holds on to the anger because he needs to hang on to all the pain and suffering he felt so it doesn’t happen again. A part of him feels like by being angry, she is facing “consequences” for her actions. Someone doesn’t like her, someone hates her, and letting go feels like he’s subconsciously *forgiving her* and he doesn’t want to ever feel that what she did was okay.

So anger is... a mix of emotions. It’s your brain saying “we were treated like shit!” And that can entail a lot of things. It’s healthy. It’s normal. Don’t focus on make the anger going away, focus on focusing on yourself, allowing yourself to feel all your doubt, insecurity, allow yourself to miss that person, allow yourself to mourn, to cry, to hate yourself. A lot of the time, anger is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die.


I am glad that this person is out of your life(?). They sound like a shitty person. Please look up “radical” acceptance sheets online, as they were EXTREMELY hard for me to do, but very eye-opening.

mentalhealth,f65tn8e,t1_f63jpbe,1572705139.0,"Yes!! **Somebody’s beauty does not take from your own!!**

Edit: I suggest “balanced thinking” for OP.

The first thing to do is identify what the thought is: which is *If I am not as thin in comparison to my partner, I am ugly and fat.*

Write an “argument” for why that is “true”, and why that is false. But remember to be as objectionable as possible. 

**For example **

This is the truth because I feel I am fat. I am very large because my partner is skinnier than I am.

This is false because I have lost weight, and what is “fat” will depend on person to person...

This is just an example, but I think a lot of the anxiety is caused because of the uncertainty of the emotion, and it goes away at this point, leaving the residual, and lesser “pain”.

Hope this helps. You are beautiful OP, you got this. Stay strong."

Personally, this is where the reliability of my advice stops LMAO 

I, too, am JUST *literally* just leaving this part of my life, slowly, so I can’t give you any “expectations” of how that looks, but I’ll try to tell you what I’ve learned so far.

First of all, don’t panic. This kind of “coasting” through life is something I did throughout my younger childhood, living off the approval of my parents, only craving good grades. It’s “okay” as a child because we live for gratification, and for our parents, but as you get older, you can basically sum it to “I have no purpose, and nothing to live for,” and that shit is hard, but lean into anxiety and fear. Fighting it only makes it worse, but I promise you will be okay. Treat yourself kindly. There are rarely “bad” consequences for letting yourself feel how you feel.

While people like us are used to working hard, studying to get the grade, the satisfaction of a letter on piece on paper, or a number on a computer.... Do this, get this result. There’s a point A and a point B. Cause and effect.

If you are trying to find a hobby, good for you! You are on the right track. But it is not like studying at ALL. 

You don’t learn the piano to learn the song. You don’t learn to knit to make the scarf. It’s about the process, losing track of time... it’s about how it makes you feel, and we’re so accustomed to being completely invested in things that feed into our self-worth/self-esteem that we don’t know how feed into anything else. Humans have a NEED to be wanted, a NEED to be needed, a need to be loved, and stimulated. 

For me, it’s needing to feel accomplished. School is relatively easy (for me), and while the grades were good and kept me feeling worthy, feeling worthy is not the same as happy. I am currently writing a book, and even though it was hard as hell to plan it, I am trying to write everyday, and it feels amazing.

I’m no longer doing this because I’m afraid of not being happy. I am not doing this because I am getting a grade. I am interacting with a community who I hope to interact with, who will understand, who will tell me what I need to improve/what I did good. 

There is not ONE thing that will make you feel “happy”. That’s not how happiness works. Life is not school. There is not a clear road. Happiness is a lifestyle. It’s a routine. It’s giving yourself structure outside of school, giving yourself goals to reach, learning to not be afraid of failing, setting boundaries, learning that it’s okay to FEEL like a failure, learning to try things in spite of your fear. And most of... it’s okay to be afraid of being unhappy. Use that fear constructively to propel yourself forward.

Unfortunately, there isn’t any advice that anyone can give you or a criteria to reach.  There are just answers that are going to be highly tailored to your life only. The only surefire thing that words for people like us is: 

1) self-reflect and identify
2) set goals 
3) and struggle and fail with whatever course of action you take, and succeed sometimes 

And that’s it. 

I was like you. I didn’t want to ask for a therapist because I felt like I didn’t deserve it, but now that I have one... it’s amazing. She taught me how worthless I felt, how much anxiety I feel about not being happy... please consider reaching out, anyway. People say “fake it until you make it”, but really, even though you feel worthless or a burden, acting the opposite will cause you to reap the benefits anyway, and will slowly reverse the effects. I like to make lists of all the things I want, and I slowly start to get them. Like a garden. I just got a rosemary bush yesterday, and I felt great. Things feel TOO good, you know? Haha.

Please keep trying. Just because you don’t have all the answers doesn’t mean you can’t be helped. Learn to ground yourself. Some things aren’t worth over-thinking about. 

I don’t think I can say anything other than that lol. But thank you for reaching out. It was SO nice to see that I’m not the only person who felt like this. I have learned a lot about myself, and I ACTUALLY know myself now. It feels so amazing, dude. You have so much to look forward to.

mentalhealth,f65eswq,t1_f65bo22,1572701664.0,"First of all, you are not weak.

I used to be friends with someone with BPD that I ultimately broke it off with. Now, I want to stress that BPD doesn’t equal a toxic person. But she *was* a very toxic, manipulative person. 

She did not know how to cope with her own emotions, and NEEDED. Like *highly co-dependent* NEEDED people to be around her, talk to her, constantly distract her because she could ABSOLUTELY NOT cope with intrusive thoughts, emotions or being alone at all. 

Even though she was not explicitly manipulating me, it was clear that how she would get angry, like PISSED, when people wouldn’t spend time with her/make her feel better/understand her immediately and that she EXPECTED people to meet her needs, and couldn’t cope otherwise. 

And that intention transferred to me, without her saying a word. I felt guilty for months after because I felt like I was a bad person, that I should have felt better, and that I should have been meeting her needs, when in reality, she had **learned helplessness**, and was pushing responsibility of her own emotions onto me, low-key expecting me to fix her, and to just “deal” with her out-bursts/anger, as a way for her to dodge the guilt.

Since then, I’ve learned that a good rule of thumb is to ask “what do you want me to do?” And if they can’t answer/don’t have a plan, they typically expect comfort from you, or they want you to “fix” it. Either way, it’s unsustainable with people like my friend and your girlfriend, because they keep asking and asking and asking, without ever truly believing it (low self-esteem/self-worth), or trying to learn to self-soothe. It’s miserable for everyone, and that is co-dependent behavior.

You are not a bad person for wanting to be happy. You are a good partner, as you’ve true to help her, and she has denied your help. 

Please leave. It is true that she is in a crappy place, but you are not responsible for that. Remember, that her expectations for you... you don’t have to reach them. That is not the standard for “being a good person.” 

I know I’ve projected a lot here, but I hope that it helps. I felt like shit for so long, constantly walking on eggshells, preforming like a monkey for her approval...I want others to understand that you NEED to care for yourself.

Additionally, if she is *threatening* you with suicide, she is manipulating you. Leave. She will most likely not change, and continue using you as “crutch”."

No offense, but it seems like you are someone who has not/does not take up a lot of hobbies or does a lot of enjoyable things, and are not sure of how to **feel about it**, and that’s okay, but there is no criteria for how you **should** feel.

This is a little unspecific for me to say “go to a therapist!!” Or “diagnose” you with depression, because “not curious” is not the same as “there is nothing that makes me feel excited, there is nothing that makes me happy, there is nothing that simulates me, there is nothing that makes me feel *calm*, for instance”.

If even asking them to change the things they say to you makes them REFUSE and tell YOU to change, then they obvious they don’t care that much.

Even if people don’t outright “use” you, people can use others for entertainment/distraction to make themselves feel better about themselves, or because they can’t cope with being alone, and if somebody treats you like this, they probably only like being friends when it’s *convenient* for them. 

Damn. This reminds me of someone I knew. They were the same way. I only knew them for ~6 months, but I will still upset almost 7-8 months after I broke it off because I thought I was a bad person who could have done better.

Either way, your family is full of crap. Ignore them, you do not need them to be less alone. You *can* manage without them, even if it is hard. 

Clearly, your issues can’t be fixed with positive attitudes  and dieting and whatever, and that’s okay. There’s nothing **”wrong””** with not being “fixed” by their bullshit. You are human who is suffering, and I want you to know that it’s going to be okay.

I am glad that you are not going to kill yourself. In fact, this post reminds me of a metaphor someone told me: friends are like parts of a tree: some will ground you like roots, some will drift off like leaves, some will take some abuse but fall of anyway... but a tree *will always have all three as long as it’s alive.*

There is still hope for you, as long as you’re still breathing.  You can have real friends if you give it time, and effort (the right kind, mind you) 

Thank you SO much for reaching out, because I promise you’re going to be exposed to so many people who sympathize and want you to be okay. I want you to be okay. You aren’t alone. I’m here with you. Feel free to PM. I do not believe I am in much of a position to help, but I do not mind being a pleasant distraction, if you so desire."

mentalhealth,f59gt6e,t1_f59g85o,1572088577.0,"Boom. Good advice. I was just about to say something like this. I just wanted to add on that if he *refuses* to change, then it’s because he doesn’t want to (*path of least resistance?*). 

Personally, I think he has low confidence, but doesn’t want to change because maybe that will “affirm” all the things that he doesn’t like about himself (“If I start coming my hair, that means I HAVE to be bad at taking care for myself/I am ugly/I need to take care of it, when that *isn’t true*)  

It seems like he just wants to feel more confident, but believes that gaining confidence is out of his control, and wants to feel like other people “like him more” so he feels better about himself?

I don’t mean this in a harsh way, it just means that if his **inner belief** is one that feels that this is out of his control, then there is little you can do for that. 

Remember to take care of yourself first. I realize this may sound harsh, but this is just going to be another learning experience for your friend, and sometimes people just need to be uncomfortable  to learn better. If you find uncomfortable on his behalf, then I suggest you distance yourself from him, because taking on someone else’s negative emotions is very unhealthy.

mentalhealth,f5564oh,t1_f5379vt,1572000933.0,"Experienced this a little in the past, kind of.

If you’re struggling with depression and you’re having an extra bad day, it’s absolutely okay to be upset. You don’t have to force yourself to be happy or smile, because ideal friends know how to entertain themselves, not take your emotions personally, and sit in that discomfort *with you*.

I don’t know how many times I came to school (just in a generally bad mood) and my friend would remark on my bad mood, and just talk about anything, try to get me to laugh... and y’know, that was partly due to the fact that I stopped trying to feel obligated to make him not/uncomfortable. A lot of the time, he lifts me out of my bad mood, or gives me a hug... so I promise that being honest has a lot of benefits, if you’re friends with the right people :)  

I’m also really impressed that you all are seeking to be happier. Godspeed."

As someone who used to do this, you are *not* going to absorb *anything* said when you shut down. It’s not something I think “exposure” can fix—meaning you may need to change how you communicate. 

I “grew out” of this when I realized said person wouldn’t stop loving me if I responded in earnest, so I’ve never actually tried this, but what if instead of having conversations where you try to talk things out, you write letters? And then you can write a response over time, where you don’t feel overwhelmed or put on the spot?
