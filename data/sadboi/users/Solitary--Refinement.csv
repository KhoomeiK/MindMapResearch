Found after my mother's father passed away in a pile of random things. (Southern Ontario)

It looks like a scribe box for a lawyer who travels. It folds out to what looks like a working area to write and stamp documents.

It has:

X2 glass & brass inkwells.

Bits of old wax for what looks like seals.

A removable working area that reveals X2 hidden drawers (and more space)

Inscription on the underside reads:

""What is Life! Tis a delicate shell, Flung up with eternity's flow, On time's bank of quicksands to dwell, And a moment its loveliness show.

Gone back to its element grand, Is the pillow that brought it on shore; See! another is washing the sand, And the beautiful shell is no more.

M. A. & J. FORSTER,

CONFECTIONERS, No. 9, MARKET-STREET, BOLTON.""

Epigenetics tells us things like starvation, stress, abuse, smoking, whatever...cause your genes to be expressed differently. In unpredictable and across a variety of health issues.

So..imagine having bpd because your great grandmother smoked, and was abused. Imagine having ADHD because your dad smoked, and your grandfather had a poor diet.
