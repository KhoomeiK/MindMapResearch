I bathe and wash my workout wear after each session using hypoallergenic soap, both for myself and laundry. I have used a dedicated pair of scissors to trim pubic hair very short to decrease the sweat it holds and to keep my costume lines neat. The scissors are sterilized after each use. The only times I have suffered yeast infections and odor is when I do not keep the hair short. 

I know not every person with a vagina has this kind of routine, but my body has benefitted from some additional grooming. While I respect the science, my experience is one of 20+ years listening to my body."

WWOOF,ereu7ng,t3_c1o20j,1560792968.0,"Only one really negative experience among positive ones. The host misrepresented himself as a fully functioning CSA with a market stand where interns had private housing and full access to food. It turned out to be a 50+ landscaping foreman who had inherited property with a few hoops and a Buckydome. All the existent crops were neglected and mismanaged, along with some stressed out chickens. The CSA and market were stocked from a supplier like a co-op grocery would order from but sold as grown on site. We were only permitted to eat what didn‚Äôt sell or from provisions he purchased without consulting the interns regarding dietary needs or preferences. On top of that, none of the rooms in the residence had doors for privacy. I think it was about three weeks before we gave up and found another farm in the region. My best advice is to communicate as much as possible if you cannot visit your host before committing. If any red flags come up, find another place instead. Your well being and quality of experience are worth it."
