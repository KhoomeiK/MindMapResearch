FriendshipAdvice,fh2avtp,t3_f169dj,1581243758.0,"i had a friend like that too and i was too scared to end everything beacause i thought i won't have any other friends but one day she went too far (she insulted my family and my little sister who has bad grades saying she was stupid) so i just cut ties with her and i made AMAZING friends and guess what now that girl has no friends and is trying to join our friend group beacause everybody realized that she was a bad person so she has no one to hang out with

moral of story, cut ties, make friends and watch her reputation burn to bits and pieces"

FriendshipAdvice,fgju1ze,t3_eywdyl,1580851395.0,"you should tell her it's kind of wrong, ask her if she likes him maybe she changed her mind, if she dosen't you should really ask her to stop beacause it can break his heart even more, hope it helps !"
FriendshipAdvice,fgjtg4n,t3_eyou8i,1580851058.0,"well i used to be in a friend group and there was this girl (rose) and she was very toxic and the others were getting influenced by her. i was always the listener and when i wanted to talk rose would say ""oh my god i don't care"" and the others would agree 

the moment i realized that it needed to stop was one day we all got on some problems. so when our teacher isn't here we are supposed to go on a room with other students and wait until the hour is over and it isn't allowed to go outside of the room (like walking around the halls and stuff). rose and her friends decided to go to the toilets to have fun and stuff but i wanted to go to a more quiet place ( i have a hiding spot). when u go to the room of the waiting (that's how i like to call it) you have to write your name and your class and she didn't but i did (i just sneaked out of the room) so a teacher asked me if rose really spent her hour out of the room and i said ""no no she first went to get her bag at the toilet and she went to the library"" when she asked me how i knew i said ""oh she told me after the hour"" i soon learned that the teacher also asked rose but rose and her friends said everything and even lies like i was with my phone listening to music (i dont even have one) ect. 

i just cut it with them and i made many new friends and i love them so much 

fun fact rose has now no friends and has a bad reputation beacause people think that she's really pity and that she's a narcissist 

so if u have a bad friend just say bye bye and if ur scared of not having friends after this then let me tell u having.no.friends.is.better.than.having.fake.friends. hope it helps"

if you still don't like her after talking to her well i think you should confront her about it in a friendly way like ""hey i'm sorry i dont feel the same but i don't wanna ruin our friendship, we can still be friends"" 

hope it helps :D"

Advice,fegsrc2,t3_eosl6k,1579101684.0,"i am in the same position as you, i procrastinate a lot and i am very very lazy so like to use what i like to call ""punishment and reward"" 

if i do something right (finishing homework, getting good grades, finishing studying) i treat myself a cup of hot chocolate 

if i do something wrong (not working, bad grades ect..) i punish myself by not eating anything chocolat-y for 3 days (i really like chocolate) 

if that still dosen't work, i suggest you talk to a therapist, they might be able to help you

hope this helps :D (sorry for my incorrect grammar, my first language isn't english)"

""Also, try not to sweat the hard answers. If it's evident that you don't immediately know it at first glance, just keep skipping to the next one. "" the problem is that most of the time, either the next question is even more hard or i just finish it all and that question has the most points. 

 ""You'll be able to come back to it later and you might have a moment of realization on your second go around. "" it rarely happens when i get that moment of realization ;-;
