I found her choice to stay frustrating. On one hand I get it, because maybe giving up everything for her boyfriend's life is unappealing, and she wants to confront her past still before she can move on, but I don't feel as if that was developed enough by the end to work? I'm replying here and quoting you because what you wrote gets at the heart of it, but I don't think was successfully conveyed on the show. 

I found myself more thinking, ""why not take the chance and the opportunity?"" Her journey through the show felt somehow misplaced with the decision at the end, if that makes sense. I think it would behoove Marianne to get some therapy, as well, because if not she'll just keep holding herself back even when there's an amazing opportunity at her door. Again, I understand, I suffer from the same shit, but at the point in the story it finishes on it felt like she had come to that conclusion too, and so I would have loved to see her give it a go and explore the potential to thrive outside of familiar/harmful environments. 

It sort of just ended up feeling too manufactured in comparison to the other drama that happened throughout the series."

I saw some people saying, now that the radio show has resurfaced, they should start with another radio series of it. That would be interesting, if they wanted to kind of start small, though I'm sure there would be people interested in letting them do whatever they wanted at this point."

The expectations, the pressures, the constant go, go, go pacing of society, and how that makes us feel like we're forever trying to play catch up. 

Those are all things we could have without a pandemic at hand, unfortunately it took one to shine a massive light on how unhealthy the way we live, and the way we demand others live, has been. I can't bring you a hopeful conclusion to this post, sadly, I think we're doomed to slip right back into our harmful ways of running the world, and will not have learned much from this...or what we have will be forgotten or sacrificed for money, but I will offer up solidarity. I hate that people are ill, and are dying, and are grieving, but for me personally it feels like I'm finally more in balance with everyone else, if that makes sense? It certainly has taken a weight off, and I have to admit to myself, there is a part of me that is terrified of going back.

I sincerely hope, after all this situation has illuminated for us as a species, we learn very valuable lessons from it and we come out of this being much kinder and understanding of one another and place our humanity first so the people who feel this way now can attempt to feel like it more often, even when everything goes back to, ""normal.""

I think they made quite an obvious choice to make it clear to us that this story goes on, and that this episode is not a knot tied onto the end of their arcs, rather it's opening doors to new ones now that these characters have all grown so much. 

Admittedly, at first I was a little thrown by the place they put Eliot in. I, too, felt being a professor was somewhat ill-fitting, and was a bit irked that his story had become too much about a romantic interest, and that he was showing signs of falling back into bad habits (i.e. the drinking, and the encouraging of it)...but reflecting back upon it, I suppose it's a decent enough depiction of the messiness of life and adulthood that this show was always about. Eliot possibly leading a calmer life, allowing himself to be open to people, while still giving into some vices is a pretty fair balance I'd say. 

And I don't think it was saying he and Charlton were destined to be together forever. I think it was merely a shining example of how far Eliot has come, and that he was no longer going to shut himself off from the world and from those who express love and care for him. That's a lovely, little bookend once you think about it, and even though I still want more for him, it's a fine farewell anyways...especially knowing there is still a lot for him (and the others) ahead."

psych,flfaty5,t1_flf8pyx,1585101994.0,"Oh, cool! I, by no means, thought I was the only one who'd be doing this. I love that fans have kept their love for it alive. Thanks for the heads up."
psych,flf8jhd,t1_flf8dib,1585100462.0,"Thank you again! I hope to kick this off tomorrow (waiting to hear back from the mods), and will link it then!"
psych,flf7vd4,t1_flf4u05,1585100016.0,"Awesome, you rock! Thank you, I'll make sure to include the link to it when making episode threads."
psych,flf43ef,t1_flf3kzq,1585097613.0,"Other people have suggested this, and I'm not the biggest (or smartest) discord user so I'd leave that up to someone else. But I'm all for it! I'll most likely be posting the discussion threads here, but there's no reason there can't be an overlap or extension of it. I say go for it!"
psych,flf3hiq,t1_flf1rf5,1585097223.0,"Lol, I figured fans would already be watching it so I don't think we need to be beholden to chronological order necessarily. I don't mind jumping around, but we'll see what other people want, of course! And you can certainly discuss with us regardless of if you're actually watching along or not."
psych,flejh47,t1_flejb71,1585085571.0,"Also, I've made a point in saying to others, that even if you don't watch a particular episode you can still participate because chances are you know it well by now anyways. That way everyone can be involved if they wish to be!"
psych,flej0iw,t1_fleixdl,1585085319.0,"Doesn't have to be from the beginning! Since we're all Psych experts around here probably, I'm sure we could come into the show at any point and pick it up just fine."
psych,fleiuzo,t1_fleeo34,1585085236.0,"Good idea, I'll check that out!"
psych,fleelgl,t1_fle6zrw,1585082897.0,"Yeah, I'd rather outsource the discord stuff because I'm just not adept at that enough, hah. My initial conceit was just doing it on here, but I know discord is popular so people are more than welcome to go off and do that themselves, or to create it at least!"
psych,fleecrb,t1_fle6tf9,1585082765.0,"That one is a good idea. I don't think you can make polls on Reddit it like that (unless they've added it recently), but I can always open up another thread with some suggestions and see which one wins out? I just wasn't trying to be a pest, lol."
psych,fle6gsq,t1_fle5v99,1585078489.0,"I mean, we can start as soon as tomorrow if people want. We do have to figure out an episode to start with though, not sure how I'll gauge that unless I make another post, but I'm not really trying to clutter the place up!"
psych,fle6cpz,t1_fle4xo5,1585078427.0,"I've seen these watch-along's happen on here all the time, it's not that difficult so I may just go that route, but people are also free to run with this and go to discord. We'll see how it goes!"
psych,fle4u1v,t1_fle4fnq,1585077615.0,"No problem, and I found myself really wanting to watch an episode of it today and realized it might be a really nice idea to try and rally up the rest of the troops. Ya know, really just try and bring some levity/solidarity to what we're all going through right now."
psych,fle4o7a,t1_fle4fki,1585077528.0,"Hm, interesting! I didn't know this was a feature. It's certainly an option! I'm now trying to figure out how everyone wants to do it!"
psych,fle4ab0,t1_fle3ofn,1585077322.0,"Yes, whatever people feel like they want to do (as long as it's civil, of course, hah) is encouraged. I wouldn't want people to feel left out, I know how much fans love the show, and I wanted to do this to just bring us all together and maybe help people feel a little less alone or more social during this time...and what better way to do that than with Psych?! 

So, totally feel free to drop on in if there's something being talked about that you're into it, even if it's pineapple hunting!"
psych,fle3xim,t1_fldq1h3,1585077134.0,"Like someone else suggested...you could do a trial run of Prime. I'm not sure if it's just a week or a month, but at least it's something?

Even if not! You can still discuss as much as you'd like from what you can remember. If people can't watch, but still want to be involved, that's just as fine, it's all in good fun!"
psych,fle3s7o,t1_fle20k9,1585077055.0,Thanks for the tip! I definitely want to make sure everyone can watch it/participate who wants to.
psych,fle3moz,t1_fle3c2n,1585076973.0,"Yeah, I'm not sure how to figure out how to see what way people want to do it.  You can't really do polls on here, right? And I don't want to just keep making posts, hah. I'll make sure to go through all the replies though and try to get a pulse on it."
psych,fle3fy9,t1_fldqdrv,1585076873.0,\*chef's kiss\* perfect
psych,fle3dx7,t1_fldqbi0,1585076843.0,"We can start wherever we want, I think there are enough episodes to go around! I wouldn't even cared if we watched them super out of order, but if you're dedicated to the watch through you're doing now that's totally cool. You obviously don't have to participate, or you could still even if you wanted because I'm sure you know the episodes well anyways...so people who don't want to actually play along could still chime in if they felt like discussing."
psych,fle371p,t1_fldpwgc,1585076740.0,"I suppose I'd see what most people felt like doing. I know it can be preferred to leave it open for a few days to a week to let everyone comment on their own time, and to really let us have proper discussions and exchanges, but if more people seemed to want to do it simultaneously that could be worked out too I'm sure. 

Hell, even both could happen. If there are some people more gung-ho to keep doing it, maybe they could just go through more episodes together in discord or something, while there's a longer, ongoing one here. It's really whatever fans would be down for."
psych,fle2tiy,t1_fldt7wx,1585076539.0,"I will be honest, and say I didn't know this was a feature on discord (I'm pretty new to it and don't use it often). Can you explain how it works? Is it just a shared screen we would all be seeing and then like a chatroom going on the side? Or is it actual watching through our webcams? I'm dumb, enlighten me!"
psych,fle2nny,t1_fldxlst,1585076452.0,"This is what I was figuring, ya know? Glad people seem to be up for it!"
psych,fle2m5i,t1_fldtpfu,1585076429.0,"I think this would all depend upon people's comfortableness with that if you mean doing video watching. I'm not sure I'd be okay with that, to be honest, (Zoom also tends to overheat my laptop so it's not something I could be doing all the time), and I'm betting others wouldn't be either...I like your spirit though & I think it's a really great way for close friends to be able to ""hang out"" during this time."
psych,fldomrk,t1_fldnwhy,1585068686.0,"Awesome! If we get a little more traction, then we can decide which episodes we all might want to watch together 👍"
