2nd, I would be okay with going to work because I am a huge car guy and I am going to be a mechanic. Other than that, I fucking hate life. I have three siblings I have to watch daily because my POS dad and step mom decide to dump their responsibilities on me while they are at work so I can't do what I want. I have done literally everything an asthmatic 14 year old can do (for free) and now it's all boring as fuck. My asthma has gotten 10x worse with physical activity so I can't ride my bike. The girl I like hates me because I'm into dark humor (I sent her a video of a live goldfish being blended and another video with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKAb4YD0Euc) song with a bunch of guys getting shot in the head or beheaded and in the end with four guys tied up with bombs on their cocks getting blown up (don't know if you guys have seen it and I can't find the actual video so I put the song to see if I can help jog your memory if you do know what I'm talking about). It's hilarious, she just doesn't get it. I cut myself constantly. Nobody likes me because I'm a goth black guy who also listens to metal (I may fit in better in high school next year, I'm in 8th grade). One of the only things I have to look forward to is going to my mom's every other weekend so I can ride my dirt bike (it's illegal where I live but my mom lives in another village with a ton of state troopers and they don't give a fuck, I've even done wheelies and I am 110% sure a cop saw me but didn't do shit, probably because there isn't a police station like we have at home). Then when I am about to ride I find out it is either too hot or too cold or too windy or it is going to rain. Plus, whenever I am here I can never sleep for whatever reason.  


TL;DR: I fucked up my life, others fucked up my life, and a ton of other factors are fucking up my life."
