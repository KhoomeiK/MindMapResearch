There are so many good people out there, you being one of them, who could of just helped save a life. You’re a fucking hero, you all are. It’s opened up my eyes a little, there are so many people who care about me, I’ve had no previous interactions with any of you and you don’t who I am, and still, you took time out of your day for me. I couldn’t appreciate it more, thank you all so so much."
depression,fr5j0gl,t1_fr5bdzu,1589909346.0,"I’ll speak to my doctor about the dosage, I think you’re right. I can’t find many good online therapists. I had some, but they all felt a little bit too robotic, like I feel like they’re just getting paid to say this. Honestly, to have 57 comments from people I’ve had no previous interactions with, it’s made my heart melt, literally. There are so many good people out there so thank you so, so much 🙏🏻"

That’s a reasonable fear, it’s so easy for people without depression/anxiety or similar to say “things will get better one day” because people like you and me want things better NOW, one day isn’t precise enough. It’s getting me sad reading and writing about this because I have 2 blood clots in my chest and I don’t want to die before I achieve my happiness.
