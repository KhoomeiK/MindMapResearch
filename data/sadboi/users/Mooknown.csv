SuicideBereavement,f9i9hsr,t3_e576d1,1575331541.0,"Hello. I've only been to one inquest but it was due to these circumstances. In my experience you have the coroner (I believe) and they took statements from any professionals that worked closely with my relative to try and gather if her actions were preplanned or misadventure. It was a very intense environment and sometimes I do think back to it. Everyone speaking was called to a stand and made to swear an oath. However I think thats due to circumstances again regarding my own experience. It was upsetting to hear that she was neglected by professionals, including teachers and school staff. But it was also nice to hear the opinions of everyone who knew her and how great she was. I'm sorry for waffling but I hope this helps. 
I believe you can ask for the transcripts of the hearing if you'd like them. I know some of my relatives couldn't face going and that is perfectly ok, and they were grateful for the transcripts that they could read if/when they feel ready. The case was adjourned twice and that was frustrating, but thinking about it now I'm glad I went. Sorry you're going through this OP."
