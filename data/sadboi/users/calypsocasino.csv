Just use the processing power/file size capability of the Xbox Series X or PS5 to make the map enormous

Medici is 45 x 45 kilometers 

I want 500 x 500 kilometers 

Thousands of places to liberate. Use the diverse weather and geography of JC4

Lots of underwater terrain 

Atmosphere ceiling of 100 kilometers so you can take like SR-71 type planes way up there 

Flamethrowers 

10 types of fighter jets 

I want enemies to try to retake liberated towns and camps 

I want it to be dark. Like concentration camps and shit that you have to liberate

Dale and Joe served in CIA SAD/SOG ground branch, the blackest of the black. Dale said he used to think Delta was the top, and then when he was in Delta he heard about CIA GB. 


Then, after he got into CIA GB, he said he heard about private assassination work (cleared by the State Department as kosher). As in, flown out to a desert in a G6, land, board a chopper, land, be given black market weapons, and then driven to a destination in an unmarked Land Rover 


Dale said that mercenary work was the absolute tippy top of operator work

So naturally I must ask: what is higher?"

SpecialAccess,fpz2d4i,t1_fpy676k,1589012450.0,"There was a several week long back and forth emailing between Mr. Durant and I, and I will keep the contents of that private. 

However, the topics discussed in the podcast were all entirely agreed upon beforehand. The previous 94 episodes I never did that. It was always ‚Äúdo it live!‚Äù

I did not want to have him come on and say the same stuff he has for a million other people, because I felt that would be me just showing him off as a guest trophy. I wanted to treat him like a human. So that immediately crossed out the lowest hanging fruit questions. 

We also had a very, very short block of time. Normally I have my guests as long as I want, sometimes 4+ hours. This was never to be longer than 30 minutes. 

In addition to the time constraint, the agreed upon questions, and my desire to not beat the same dead horse, he is also the founder and CEO of his corporation, Pinnacle Solutions and thus had maintain a certain image. For comparison, my podcast is normally insanely vulgar and informal. 

Lastly, I started this podcast in December 2019, and admittedly have zero idea what I‚Äôm doing lol. I have a biology degree, was accepted to medical school but opted out.
