CPS,fr3nml8,t1_fr067w0,1589861489.0,"I'm not sure if your saying that my grammar & writing make you worried about the child, but I can assure you that I have a master's degree in communication and an undergrad in literature, but it doesn't always extend to my writing on this platform, particularly on mobile at 11pm.

My sister has never been physically abused, her first relationship was very emotionally abusive in a strange way. He isolated her & they both fed off of each other's complacency until they were practically homeless and unable to support themselves. Her new quasi-husband showed some strange signs of aggression but it seemed more like adolescent ideation of how ""cool"" it is to start fights. I was told he was fired from his first job at a fast food restaurant for getting into fights. I wrote it off as stupid teenage stuff but now I'm wondering how much was just his personality.

We live in a red state, despite my best efforts to the contrary, and she is definitely not focused on getting her life in order to provide a safe home for her child. She actually seems unusually preoccupied with getting a message through to the man who lied to her, abused her, convinced her to take responsibility & then left her at a mental hospital while putting her things in bags on the porch. She seems to have zero desire but to get him back & it's disturbing in all honesty. 

If she'd shown even a little remorse or showed some acceptance of the blame, taken any responsibility and assigned it to either one of them I'd feel more comfortable but as it stands I cannot even say with certainty that I fully believe she was unaware of the abuse. She wasn't working, neither was he or his mom & I find it difficult to believe they all lived in together and no one saw anything at all wrong with the clearly malnourished and injured son. I hope she wakes up & starts to grow up but I'm not betting on it."
CPS,fr3lysv,t1_fr0009a,1589860355.0,"You are right about a couple of things. My sister has had very few jobs, mostly retail, though she did at one time write a self published novel but otherwise I've never seen her show much initiative for finding steady employement. Both she & the babies father were unemployed when they began seeing each other (26 & 25 y/o respectively) and we're both living with parents. The entire pregnancy she claimed to be unable to find work & says that both her stepdad & his stepdad promised him a job that they never delivered. She seems to blame them for not giving him a job in either field that he was unqualified for & claims it's their fault he was so stressed because they moved based on this promise of work.

What confuses me more than anything is that my sister is genuinely an intelligent person. She's well read, incredibly well spoken and could easily apply herself and be successful at a variety of different kinds of work. She's never shown much work ethic though & has generally been happy to basically do nothing to further her financial stability. None of her relationships (all 2 of them) were emotionally immature with skewed ideas of what love should ""feel"" like but to my knowledge & from my first hand account, they were never physically abusive to her but both manipulated her I  different ways.

My biggest concern is that she only wants to be with this man-child & has assigned him no blame, or even shown an ounce of anger or resentment at him having physically hurt her child & seems to think he is being victimized by his family. I'm sure his mother to some extent is controlling but he's 26, it's not really a valid excuse anymore."

I'll continue to love her & support her however I can with your advice in mind."
CPS,fqynbze,t1_fqyk2md,1589751385.0,"Thank you for your insight and compassion. My sister's son was also under weight but they claimed that they were working on a plan for weight gain, though I'm not entirely sure of the validity of that claim.

I asked her what she wanted, if she was going to try and regain custody or if she wanted to give up parental rights but her answer was that her ultimate goal was to get her ""whole family"" back together. I love my sister and I want to believe that she wants her child back, but it almost seemed disingenuous when she spoke about him. She stayed with me the entire weekend and all of our conversations came back to her concern about her ""husband"" (I recently found out they are not legally married because they were ""too busy"" to fill out the paperwork). They have not spoken since the arrest and she seemed far more distressed about that than she did not seeing her son for the past month. Conversations about regaining custody seemed kind of rehearsed and like she knows what she is supposed to say. 

When I specifically asked about how he was healing and if they were worried about permanent damage she said ""he is great and they have some kind of neurologist set up like this week or next"". That I could tell the only remorse she felt was for the possible jail time her husband may face because of it. She kept saying he obviously needs mental health help but doesn't feel he should go to jail or be otherwise punished.

I keep hoping that she will recognize her responsibility is to her son, not this man she's known for less than 2 years, but I can't force that realization. She continued to blame his mom for not getting him the job she promised, and her own mom for not allowing them to live there after he was born, she blamed the stress of living with his family but not once did she assign any blame to him or herself. I should mention that neither of them had jobs the entire time she was pregnant, and in the months following. He did work 2 construction gigs but was not called back because he and I'm quoting my sister here ""occasionally zoned out"". I don't know what that means.

I love her so much, but I don't think she is taking any responsibility and I don't think she feels any remorse. It's heartbreaking."

The color is pretty unique as well, it's a very light Amber leaning orange that to me at least is easily recognizable, clear in a way that makes you think it's been watered down but the flavor itself is full and rich. It's always served over ice & it's possible they water down the decoction but it's also possible that they use Ice fill levels to do that consistently. It's definitely meant to be iced directly from hot/warm.

Dallas,fq8nviw,t1_fq8dxlz,1589170724.0,"Watching the West Wing again & they talk about how many people say that they are against any ""wealth taxes"" because the American Dream, the Capitalistic Ideology, had wrongly convinced so many that one day they'll be wealthy enough to be impacted by the taxes. Nothing has ever rung more true to me. Before I really understood politics in any meaningful way, I had some similar ideas to what you mentioned above, and I don't say any of the following to try & change your mind but there are some flaws (in my opinion) with those policies.

Firstly, economically, Trump was 100% benefitting from previous trajectories, but he also grew the economy by ignoring the long-term effects of his policies. Sure it's great that coal, steel & oil futures were growing (especially if you invest in them) but the cost of deregulation of these industries will, without question, be passed to a future generation that lacks environmental protections. China became a powerful world economy by deregulation, if there are no laws to break you can definitely build a strong economy but what impact has it had on wealth distribution, climate & their people? Regan grew the economy as well, but the consequences of the deregulation of so many things is short-sighted & does a disservice to all future generations.

Where guns are concerned, there's really not  much common ground here. I have a whole family who hunt, support the NRA & my parents own a myriad of custom guns & I just don't get it. A gun didn't keep my mom or me from being raped, they didn't stop my parents house from being robbed or my car from being stole. The 2nd amendment guaranteed your right to a gun that the framers couldn't possibly have conceived of, but that said I'm fine with you keeping a gun, but if you don't understand why people want better gun control or too ban assault rifles then watch the videos of an unarmed man being shot dead for jogging or of the spray of bullets at a Vegas concert. Talk to people who have been the victim of gun violence & tell me what an AR 15 is going to provide that a Glock or a shotgun isn't. You own guns for fun & that's cool but some people own them to shoot elementary school children & if you support their right to own an assault rifle I am not sure how to explain the logical fallacy there.

Lastly, a pandemic was not ""unleashed"" on us out of spite. A government chose to keep a secret longer than they should have & ruined millions of lives, but so has our government. Agent Orange, Napalm, The Bikini Atoll all travesties, some legitimate war crimes perpetrated by our government and no one was ""held accountable"" - Did the Chinese Government make a mistake to protect their own interest at the expense of humanity? Yes, absolutely but I'd argue Trump's downplaying of the virus, his push for states to reopen are just as, if not more, to blame for the pandemic. Imagine, as a citizen, being held responsible because of a decision your government made to protect their interests. Trump will no more hold them accountable than he did force Mexico to pay for some racist wall and if you think he will, you've been drinking too much koolaid.

Again I understand I'm not going to change your mind but I want to encourage you to watch, listen & read a few stories out of your echo chamber. I watch Fox news occasionally & read T_D subs to see what, if any, points are made & it's healthy to do that. Hear both sides of a story & decide where you fall."

We were literally the most basic upper middle class, living in a sub division in a suburb white family. My sister's & I found it so funny watching her try & comprehend the story.

Her ""matrix"" style control of machines by code manipulation is genuinely compelling & fun to watch. Her relationships with Hector, the lab techs, Lee we're all written well. Where Dolores turned into some philosophical 8-ball spouting random fortune cookie ""knowledge"" through convoluted metaphors, Maeve's dry wit & genuine emotion were worth emotional investment. All they had to do was continue her motivation from S2, instead they make her motivation purely self-serving. Your depiction is what I kept hoping would be revealed as the real reason she was working with Serrac, not to bring him the Valley, but to ensure it was forever safe. She could continue her double-agency using Serrac's resources like Dolores' personal assistant ear cuff. 

Also if I thought Hale's character couldn't get anymore comically villainous I was sadly mistaken. In S2 her over the top greed & perfectly tailored suits were like Dr. Evil found a Brooks Brothers. She didn't need to become some tragic anti-hero version of Dolores. They had an opportunity to insert Clementine as this twisted, constantly controlled, emotionally fragile pawn who finally breaks free from her masters & becomes a true opponent to both the system that controlled her but also those who would seek that kind of control ever again..."

The Migraines are more ""crisp"" and the areas of pain are well defined, recurrent and unrelenting. 

A sinus headache is something that I can distract myself from, even if only for a few minutes. A migraine is all consuming, there is no relief or even a second where I am distracted and not acutely aware of the pain, it's debilitating an hopeless.
