On the bass these headsets doesn't perform well because they are open. But I compensate with a EQ on my computer for that when I am listening to music. For gaming I do not use EQ in bass hefty games.

I had a Creative Titanium HD to drive the headsett, and it was okay, could not give out power enough for the bass as high as you wanted, but enough.

Upgraded then to using THX AAA 789 using the Titanium HD as a DAC (line out), but the gain of sound quality wasn't that much, but slight. Then I got a SMSL su-8, a bit more quality was gained then.
