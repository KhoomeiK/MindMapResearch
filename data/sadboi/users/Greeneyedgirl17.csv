Eating disorders are one of the hardest disorders to treat. I think for many it will be a life long struggle, that requires maintenance and vigilance. Restricting is a coping mechanism, and can offer a form of control in a time when we have so little. Its much more complex than simply wanting to be thin. 

Personally, i used to love it when ppl would tell me to eat more. It would only validate that what i was doing was working. Maybe dont focus on what shes eating,but what she's feeling. The amount she consumes is just the symptom not the root cause.  What helped me was distraction. I was always trapped in my eating disordered mind. Its a place full of hate and self loathing. I wanted to punish myself and basically didnt think i deserved to it. It was always worse when i was alone. I had nothing to counteract my impulses. The more engaged and connected i was, the easier to became to eat normally. Its very addictive, driven by low self esteem, depression, and anxiety. She should look into to teletherapy etc. because I dont think its borderline impossible to recover from an eating disorder without  professional intervention"

Its for the men watching, not for women. Its womens sexuality viewed through the male gaze.

Everyone here seems to be offering advice on how you should change. Its your bf that needs to wise up. He should listen to the words coming out of your mouth and not make you feel self-conscious or like you aren't doing it right.

I think BPD has such a high rate of suicide attempts and completed suicides because we are so impulsive and a lot of the time it’s “passive suicide”.

 Its like putting on noise-canceling headphones while playing video games so you don't hear your new born baby cry.

 Just because you don't hear it, doesn't mean it isn't happening. You just wanted a little break right? You deserve some relaxation and screen time, the baby will be fine, right? Wrong. Your baby is still suffering. You are still being a neglectful parent, just one willfully ambivalent to reality. Your SO will go ape shit when they come home and realize the baby has been laying in its own shit/starving all evening. Doesn't mean they wont gut you like a fish for endangering their child. Doesn't mean you will feel better about being a parent, or rested and rejuvenated after your gam session. If anything you are left with more guilt shame and anxiety from the ordeal- leading to more problematic behavior.

Opposite action is doing the thing you don’t want to do. Acting against your impulse to skip class or spend money etc.  

“T stands for Tip The Temperature: In order to calm down quickly, try holding your breath and putting your face in a bowl of cold water or holding a cold pack on your eyes and cheeks for at least 30 seconds. This will cue your mammalian diving reflex which is a natural reflex that occurs in all mammals and is triggered in humans when our faces are submerged in cold water. The reflex causes our body chemistry to change—heart rate drops down immediately and the parasympathetic nervous system is activated to prompt a relaxation response. Make sure to keep water above 50 degrees Fahrenheit

I stands for Intense Exercise: Try to engage in intensive exercise, even if it’s only for a short amount of time. Exercising intensely will help your body get rid of negative energy that can sometimes be stored from strong emotions. Get rid of this energy by running, walking at a fast pace, doing jumping jacks, etc. Exercise naturally releases endorphins which will help combat any negative emotions like anger, anxiety, or sadness.

P stands for Paced Breathing: Another way to cue your parasympathetic nervous system is to breathe deeply into your stomach. Try to slow down the pace of your inhales and exhales (on average, five to six breaths per minute). It helps if you try to breathe out more slowly than you breathe in.

The last P in TIPP stands for Paired Muscle Relaxation: It can help if you add muscle relaxation to paced breathing. While breathing deeply and slowly, deeply tense each of your body muscles one by one. Notice this tension and then breathe out and let go of the tension by completely relaxing your muscles. Pay attention to the difference in your body as you tense and let go of each muscle group.

The TIPP skills may not work immediately, but with practice they can help to build up your ability to regulate strong emotions, manage difficult situations, and generally feel better. It can take some practice and in many cases it helps to work with a DBT therapist to ensure that you are engaging in the skills correctly. Part of DBT can include sessions to focus on breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation to help gain mastery of the skills.”"

Just something that just needs to be addressed transparently 
I think now would be a good time use those boundaries!
If you don’t want to face time you with her, u don’t have too.
Take some time for yourself! Let your SO do the talking and you get some rest.
And yes she could be disappointed/ passive aggressive but it’s not your responsibility to handle her emotional load.
You are RECOVERING and need to take care YOU. Fuck this global pandemic and demanding MILs! You do you boo. 

Therapy is a greAt idea, I’ve been in therapy for ten years and think everyone should have a therapist.

Will seriously help with transition into motherhood and all the other expectations that come with it! Personally LCSWs and dbt therapists have been the least judgmental/ holistic for me. They are client centered 
And don’t impose there beliefs on you- really give you space to LET LOOSE and be bat shit. IN DBT  the whole idea is your feelings and thoughts are never wrong/ invalid  per say it’s all about how you react to them.examining your own  patterns so you can check them- the learn to better manage them. Really helpful coping techniques and strategies that are more than just “breathe deeply”.  Lots on communication and interpersonal relat. Not big on pathologizing or diagnosing, kind of like we are all ppl with shit don’t gotta label it. It’s very holistic and BALANCE is the goal
Shit literally saved my life.
But you might have to start with Skype sessions cause my therapy has been moved online indefinitely.
Happy to answer any more questions about it.
Get some rest, love that baby, and talk to that hubby! 
Wishing you the best xx"

relationships,fkqcip8,t3_fjtp6i,1584440368.0,"I think you are completely entitled to your emotions. Birth is minimized so much in our culture, almost as if its expected, a duty to dedicate our lives too. There isnt much education/ exposure to the entire process of it all, the aftermath etc. ESPECIALLY for men, culturally i fee like there is little to no archetypes in pop culture that clearly capture a women experience of birth. I mean its horrifying. Your body will NEVER be the same. You just had a parasite living inside you-feeding of your nutrients to survive- and then shoved it out of your pelvis, or had it ripped from you stomach like an ACTUAL alien. You are numbed from the waste down with staples in you stomach?  Think of all the stress the body is under during labor, the hormones etc. Im surprised women arent quarantined after the fact to ""sleep it off"" if you will. 

I also have an SO whos family we arent as comfortable around. Like he gets drunker around my family than his own. His family is great they are just really different form mine. They care about what people think and what's appropriate. My SO and his siblings always put there best foot foward in thier company and only talk about fun happy stuff- they put on a show. All for thier stingy attention.They are def quietly judgmental and passive aggressive as hell. MY FAM is straight up aggressive and will roast you if you say one nice thing about yourself that isnt sarcastic. We laugh and talk Shit and NEVER take ourselves too seriously. They are feral drunks with little to no expectations of others. 

I get the MIL thing. I have to mentally prepare myself to see them in general, and im on my best behavior. 

Hey its OK to be sad about the first outfit, but you have so many firsts with this kiddo. SO MANY. Ones much more memorable because your kid will remember them too Ive never had a kid and the first one sounds like a dousy so im sure ill be eating my words if it happens to me haha

&#x200B;

I dont think this was a fundamental failure by your SO or some massive red flag. We cannot expect people to understand our perspectives if we aren't radically honest with them. And push back when they say things ""well i thought you wouldnt mind"" etc. He was having his first baby, an emotionally turbulent but non the less happy occasion. he has the easier role no doubt but I can see how a guy could feel left out/ a bit useless  from the entire experience. Cause fundamentally it was ALL YOU. That's why your family is allowed and your wishes put first. I can see how he would want to share this moment with his ma but it was not an appropriate time. You needed his full and unquestioned support then, and you gotta make it clear for next time that birth is your arena. Your domain and he is going to have to accept that. Its OK to be selfish, put yourself first, and let others down the after giving birth. YOU CREATED A HUMAN BEING. Your done for the day.  

Sorry for the wall but I just hate seeing posts being like ""ya there horrible, dump them, and bury the body"" when they dont know the person at all. I think its ok for you to mad, and i think its also ok for you to forgive him and make a plan going forward. And to recognize that your body went through a trauma, your hormones are fucked, and your exhausted- doesnt make your feelings any less real! Just have to make sure we take it into context.

me_irl,fkq4hpv,t3_fk0zmo,1584430169.0,"what product/technology/ resource does the federal government have a monopoly on? 

A monopoly is a business structure in which an entity controls so much of a certain product (its production/ access etc) that it essentially sets its price and  impossible for other competitors to enter the free market economy. It is a product of unregulated capitalism, where the rich and powerful are able to gain more riches and power.

Instead of the consumer or supply/demand decide the economic landscape, a person or corporation that dominates the market holds the power through their unfairly exaggerated amount of influence.

Monopolies are not good for the consumer. They are good for businesses.

The opposite of capitalism is communism- an equal distribution of wealth. Which is a large part of Bernies campaign."
TalkTherapy,fkq3kno,t3_fjzjhe,1584429078.0,"not make her feel bad about little things/ offer unsolicited criticism or suggestions (sentences that start with (You should or you could etc). When I first entered recovery, I was a shell. I just existed. I was going through the motions. I wasn't invested nor did I have hope. I was just doing what people wanted. I didn't actually believe life was going to be different. 

Everything was raw. I was an exposed nerve. My head was a war zone and the mental onslaught I was inflicting on myself was emotional terrorism. I couldn't even look in the mirror I hated myself so much. 

So if my mom innocently pointed out I had left a dish out, that I didn't look good, that I was eating badly, or in general criticizing me while she was trying to ""encourage"" me, I would spiral. I already thought I was worthless and having others point out the many ways I was failing to be meet the basic standards of being a human was agonizing. 

I had no energy and no motivation. It was a good day for me if I didnt drink. If I washed my face. I would just manage your expectations and not project them on her. Dont use the standards you have for yourself to judge her. Dont compare her to others. 

There is no perfect road map for recovery. A checklist. Or a timeline. Everyone journey is so different and it is rarely straight. There will likely be detours, backslides, and dead ends. 

Change won't happen overnight. It happens little by little, and every shred of progress, no matter how small, will add up over time. It took me years to get where I am. Many dif therapists and approaches. Many times I fell back into old patterns, thinking I was of the path entirely, not realizing it was all part of the process. Every mistake I made I learned something valuable that helped me continue my search for happiness. 

Just remain encouraging, supportive, and safe. Accept her how she is and meet her where she is at.  If she fucks up, love her though it. But you cant do it for her. People have to want to be healthy, an active participant in their recovery. You cant want it more than her or ignore your own needs in favor of hers. Maintain healthy boundaries. 

Leave the therapy to the professionals. I feel like my family was always asking me about therapy, giving me tips, wanting to talk about my mental state in general. Constantly reminded of my illness. I felt like  a walking diagnosis. I just wanted to be without having the notice the trauma, self-harm, and addiction. I think offering a distraction from therapy is helpful. Make plans, go camping, get outside, send memes, and be silly. Doesn't always have to be heavy. By her partner not her practitioner."

asktransgender,fitidz3,t1_fitecp5,1582721002.0,"“Individuals who experience a gender identity that is discordant with biological sex are increasingly presenting to physicians for assistance in alleviating associated psychological distress. In contrast to prior efforts to identify and primarily address underlying psychiatric contributors to gender dysphoria, interventions that include uncritical social affirmation, use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists to suppress normally timed puberty, and administration of cross-sex steroid hormones to induce desired secondary sex characteristics are now advocated by an emerging cohort of transgender medicine specialists. For patients with persistent gender dysphoria, surgery is offered to alter the appearance of breasts and genital organs. Efforts to address ethical concerns regarding this contentious treatment paradigm are dependent upon reliable evidence on immediate and long-term risks and benefits. Although strong recommendations have been made for invasive and potentially irreversible interventions, high-quality scientific data on the effects of this approach are generally lacking. Limitations of the existing transgender literature include general lack of randomized prospective trial design, small sample size, recruitment bias, short study duration, high subject dropout rates, and reliance on “expert” opinion. Existing data reveal significant intervention-associated morbidity and raise serious concern that the primary goal of suicide prevention is not achieved. In addition to substantial moral questions, adherence to established principles of evidence-based medicine necessitates a high degree of caution in accepting gender-affirming medical interventions as a preferred treatment approach. Continued consideration and rigorous investigation of alternate approaches to alleviating suffering in people with gender dysphoria are warranted.”

“In relation to the etiology of GD, we should consider other potential mental problems and environmental factors. Review the literature on comorbid psychiatric conditions of GD demonstrates that different estimated prevalence of comorbid psychiatric disorders have been reported in individuals with GD.28) A recent study reported current prevalence of comorbid conditions (according to another current DSM disorders other than personality disorders) in 38% of MtFs and 37% of FtMs. This study also reported lifetime prevalence of DSM disorders, excluding personality disorders, in 68% of MtFs and 71% of FtMs.29) Personality disorders have been observed in 12% of MtFs and 18% of FtMs. Most prevalent personality disorders in transgender people were schizoid, avoidant and borderline.29) Moreover, regarding environmental factors, parenting and family variables, such as very closeness to the mother, father absence, parental wish for a boy or daughter and psychopathology in the parents, have been suggested to contribute to the GD as major factors.9) Also, wrong self-knowledge is an another potential contributing factor to the GD, which means the wrong recognition of the natal sex by the subject independent from parenting due to improper experiences in life and misunderstanding of these experiences.30)”

It is suggested that the divergence between natal sex and gender identity arises from the temporal contrast between sexual differentiations of the genital organs and the brain.31,32) In fact, the biological influence of testosterone or absence of this hormone during the first half of pregnancy results in development of male or female genital organs, respectively. However, the brain differentiates sexually during the second half of pregnancy, which is much later than that of sexual organs in the course of fetal development. Therefore, these two developmental processes are chronologically independent, and it is concluded that masculinization or feminization of the genitals may not inevitably bring into that of the brain. For this reason, several neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have investigated structural and functional differences of the brain between transgender and non-transgender people to prove this claim. In the following, we first review the studies on the brain of transgender people and then we will discuss the validity of this claim.”

“In general, an overview of brain morphometric and neural activity findings in transgenders demonstrates contradictory results, which cannot reflect masculinization or feminization of the transgenders’ brain. Indeed, there are very inconsistent neuroanatomical and neurofunctional differences between transgender subjects and same sex controls that are detectable at the group level rather than individual level. The question here is whether these reported changes form part of the etiology of transsexualism or themselves result from transsexualism culture, behaviors and lifestyle. “
“Existing literature demonstrates that there is no solid evidence for the differences in the function/structure of the brain between children and adolescents with and without GD. Indeed, there is no comprehensive selfness and understanding of sexual issues in childhood and adolescence. The cultural and sociocultural contexts and specific cultural environment based behaviors have not yet fully developed in this period. In fact, these contexts are emerging and developing in this period of life”
“After adolescence and over time, the subject becomes more familiar with gender and sexual issues and faces transsexualism (or even homosexuality) due to lack of proper selfness, lack of appropriate parenting or his/her childhood background. Then, new ideas and beliefs (i.e., a new specific cultural environment) form for the subject that lead to inappropriate for his/her own biological sex. Consequently, the subject attempts to avoid right and normal culturally contextualized behaviors. He/she imagines himself/herself in his/her preferred gender identity rather than his/her biological sex, and thus tries to adapt his/her values, lifestyle and behaviors to his/her gender identity. Therefore, a subject with GD tries to experience life in his/her preferred gender identity and skews from his/her biological gender and normal culturally contextualized behaviors every day. Depending on how much the subject with GD persists in changing his/her gender (i.e., positive, neutral or negative transgenders) and the extent to which he/she has experienced gender identity, we will observe brain changes and, as a result, related culturally voluntary behaviors”"

Of course it only made things worse, as meaningless sex with strangers when your sad tends to.

But thats actually misleading as your brain never truly finishes growing, its continuously changing. The frontal lobe is where your higher executive functions are housed as well as what makes you ""you"". Its your personality etc. Your prefrontal cortex plays a role in impulse control, decision-making, your ability to delay gratification instead of immediately seek reward. Because of this, you are more susceptible to peer pressure because you seek the reward of acceptance/validation/approval of your peers more than you will later in your brain development. It is why you are not treated the same under the law as someone who is older. Why there are juvenile correctional facilities separate from adult offenders. Why you are not allowed to buy cigs or alcohol. Why its considered rape if you have sexual relations with someone over 18. Why you can't do things without parental consent. 

When I was a teenager I was an exposed nerve. Everything felt immediate, intense, and earth-shattering. My emotions dictated every thought. My opinions I felt in my bones. Situations affected me entirely. I was explosive, inconsolable, and euphoric all within the span of 24 hours. All i cared about was what people thought of me, the acceptance of my peers. The belonging to something. My anger was always warranted, my reactions out of my control. I was entitled to my emotions, accepted them entirely without question or investigation. I had no perspective, I only saw life through my eyes. I couldnt put myself in other ppl shoes, or see nuance. I couldn't separate myself from my emotions or conceive of a future where I was happier. I lived in the present, and acted as if there was no tomorrow. I was a completely different person when i was 17. I cannot express how much i have changed in the past ten years. I look back on my teen years and wonder how that feral animal even survived.

 There is a lot of evidence supporting this. Quick google search and these two came up.

stopdrinking,fisebog,t3_f9l8du,1582683212.0,"Hey buddy, 

you gotta go easy on yourself. Alcohol is an addictive substance readily available, and not only socially sanctioned, but encouraged. This could be last day one, but it could also not be, and thats OK.

Your sober time isnt erased every time you drink. Its like building a muscle, the more you do it, the easier it gets. 

For me in the beginning I went on antabuse. It was pill that made you sick if you drank and stayed in your system two weeks, so even if I impulsively didnt take it one day, i would usually come to my senses before shit went down. I basically drugged myself every morning before I was conscious enough to start the inevitable internal struggle. Swallowed it without thinking. My impulse control is horrible, so I had to take the choice away from myself so I could finally throw myself into sobriety, both feet baby.

YOU HAVE TO FILL YOUR TIME AND PLAN AHEAD. I didnt go out with friends until like month 3. I made my family entertain me, told them my drinking is a serious problem and I needed help. They are british and sarcastic and booze is a nightly thing in my house. 

 I hunkered down like it was the apocalypse. My bedroom became my bomb shelter. Alcohol; the nuclear option. I put so much space between me and alcohol. I started running. Picked up a hobbies like painting, even though i was shit, thrifted all the time, spent money on things i shouldnt, ate like the sugar plum fairy, smoked cigs like a trash dragon, and basically did whatever the fuck i wanted.

I had very little expectations for myself except not drinking. You cant change all at once. This is a harm reduction approach my friend, not abstinence only. I was in therapy twice a week doing the emotional work that was fueling my drinking.

Once i was away from it all, and got some much-needed perspective i felt like i had escaped a cult. Everyone thinks alcohol is great and you need it to have fun- thats honestly sad. I feel sorry for them. I dont think about alcohol anymore...ever. I dont need it to loosen up or laugh loudly. I was never having fun when i was drinking, it was always a way to self harm and self sabotage. I was punishing myself. I didnt think i deserved a better life, so didnt even want to try.

Once you take those rose colored glasses off, you will never look back.

Im sure its been mentioned but you gotta read this naked mind to deprogram societies messaging around alcohol.

Women have babies everyday so child birth is minimized to just a part of life when in reality its a fucking horror show, that will scar you forever. And we are just expected to do it like its nothing.

I literally could have written this post. Im 26 and still feel the same way. I understand the desire to make a little baby that looks like you and your S/O. But ive realized thats kind of just your ego talking. I some ppl  want to create a mini me, propagate the blood line or something.

I know I could love a baby that wasnt mine just the same. 

 My mental health is kept in check by me at all times. If I had a kid I have no idea how I would keep my shit together. Post partum? Already danced with depression, dont particularly feel like doing it again. There are too many variables I cant control, and thier are so many kids already who NEED homes."
Psychiatry,fiq4amp,t3_f99kch,1582634641.0,"I feel like this is what happened to my grandma at the end. She had Parkinson’s and they drugged her up until she was unrecognizable. Couldn’t even button her pants after peeing, while two years before I had to run to keep up with her because she walked so damn fast. 
I feel like questioning the initial depression and anxiety isn’t really productive. That would invalidate the last ten years for her.  

I was at my worst when I was on like 8 different meds. Had a psychotic break.
If she’s on benzodiazepines and anti psychs I have no idea how she even lifts her head up. At this point she’s probably addicted to them, because she hasn’t dealt with the underlying issues. They just threw pills at her. 

When I actually starting doing therapy twice a week and talking to someone, i was able to see how the medication was hindering my life.
Psychiatrists are not gods. They make mistakes. Half of the pills they give they don’t even know how it works in the brain. Literally. 
Frame it in a loving way, how you want more for her, how you think her life could be more than this, that you just want her to get a second opinion because you aren’t sure this is the best course of action. The medications are strong and seriously changing her brain chemistry. 
Don’t start with, you don’t need meds, cause she’s convinced she does. Go slowly and tread lightly. she has to make the decision on her own, otherwise she’ll feel as thought something is being taken from her. 
Wishing you the best of luck xx"

What helped me, was not taking my thoughts around alcohol so seriously. Treating them more like dreams, with less validity and connection to reality. 
I would approach them with curiosity not as much concern. Like why I wonder do I feel like drinking? Am I tried? Hungry? Somehow vulnerable? 

What’s going on? The underlying motivation? And if none was found,
Let the thought fly away. Come and go. I didn’t want to fixate, because like you I knew I wasn’t going back.

Also checking the facts-poking holes in all the propaganda my pickled brain was peddling.
No it was never one glass. No you could never moderate. No it isn’t worth it. No this time won’t be different. Etc.

It’s ok to miss something, but we pining after a ghost. Something that was never real. What was real was the pain not the pleasure. 

The brain hangs on to the good memories and blurs the bad ones. Otherwise we would never leave the house lol. Tell your brain it’s being silly, you know better, it’s lucky it’s got you around to keep it from driving off a bridge."
stopdrinking,fiq2xwu,t3_f93eqs,1582633344.0,"Alcohol had as all in abusive relationship. One with busy up blow outs mixed in with bouquets of flowers, apologies, and boxes of chocolate. We weren’t always unhappy, us and alcohol. 
In the beginning it was amazing. It made us feel good/brave. But then slowly but surely, the hangovers lasted longer than the highs.   

Alcohol gained our trust and love, and used it against us. It knew we needed it, and kept us trapped in a cycle of misery. Rinse and repeat. 

Over time, we couldn’t deny it any longer. We stopped loving alcohol, knew it was bad for us, and that no matter how much it pleaded, things would never change.

Still we couldn’t leave. Had been brainwashed into thinking we needed it to function or survive. Even thought a life with alcohol was what was killing us.

I know I stopped drinking because I knew I had to commit to living or commit to dying. I couldn’t continue with the half -assed aimless existence, filled with the same agonizing thirst. That no matter how much I drank, would never be quenched. I tried to fill myself up with alcohol because it was easier than being empty.

Now I am what nourishes me. I am the loving supportive partner I always needed. 

This was never going to be easy. You learned to live with alcohol, like a shadow. You are learning it all over again. 

It took me years to get to this point. Painful beautiful years. Keep your head up and be kind to yourself. Your stronger than you realize and more capable than you know.
Wishing you the best xx"
