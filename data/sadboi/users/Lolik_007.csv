1. YES because I got my vaginismus from a traumatic experience and I consider it a part of my trauma
2. YES because despite it not getting vaginismus from an underlying trauma it gave me so much emotional distress that I'd consider it a trauma

3. NO because despite having vaginismus I didn't feel pressured my myself or my partner or the people that I surround myself with to get cured and I took my time and had enough patience with myself.
4. NO because despite my vaginismus being very painful and unpleasant I feel like my vaginismus doesn't have the right to be considered a trauma.

Antitheism,fnarfk1,t1_fnaiid6,1586802503.0,"You are completely right. Don't get me wrong I am fully aware of the falsehood of this argument that ""all religion is evil"" but at the other hand because I have been around people that have been treated badly for religious reasons I can say that for me personally yes all religion is evil. It's a very personal view that you need to be able to defend yourself and as long as you are aware that it's flawed I don't think it's bad. 

Sometimes we just have personal experiences that make us feel strongly about a certain topic and for me it happens to be religion. 

Also there is a difference between science /medicine and the government being evil and religion. The gov /medicine and science is needed to evolve the entire world and the society we live in. Does that mean that those fields are flawless and shouldn't be up for criticism? No. Imo it's very important to ask questions and criticise the gov and scientific/medical developments.

But without a gov we have Anarchy which is a complete mess. Without medicine we would not have the power to cure a lot of diseases and without science we still would believe the church.

Meanwhile church and religions on the other hands are very easily replacable. You can be a nice person just out of common sense and you don't need the threat of eternal hell in order to be nice.

Now we can argue about whether or not we could have moral and good principles without religion and if we would have been able to get a functioning gov without religion as a basis but I don't know enough in order to argue about that and I'd need to first read some theories before I make up my own conclusions about it."

I fucked it up a little bit around my throat and head area. My throat is actually very slim and long when compared to my body.

Just because you have wide shoulders it  doesn't make you immediately an N especially if the rest of your body is balanced and is a C.

Same goes in the different way. Just because you have C shoulders it doesn't make you a C. So I do think that you can have different elements from a certain body. If you are an SN but have two or three elements that maybe don't belong to the original ID doesn't make you all of the sudden an DC or SC. Because your entire body including face has overall SN features. That's at least my opinion"

I as an example think that I'm mostly SN but I do have some classic elements in me. But the classic elements are in my body and not in my face. It still makes me an SN imo because overall if you look at my entire body SN clothes look better on me than C clothes imo."
Kibbe,flrhroz,t3_fqo010,1585420465.0,In this case I think the outline is not enough and I personally would need to see your face. You clearly have a D body but you said you are 5'4 which is short for a D. So maybe you are an FG? Idk I just don't think that this is enough info.
Kibbe,flqox75,t1_flqodxv,1585402278.0,Hot take: I think every mental illness is on a spectrum. Or at least most of them are. I just know it from my experience with mentally ill people and having been one myself. :)
Kibbe,flqo1w7,t3_fqirhn,1585401522.0,"I think body dysmorphia is something that people can suffer but I think it's more of a spectrum.

I see it like depression : there is ""mild"" depression and then there is ""severe"" depression. Just because one has a ""mild"" one doesn't mean that they don't have it or that they don't need help as much as the one with ""severe"" depression.

I also think it depends on the environment you grew up regarding body positivity and mental health. I as an example don't see myself as body dysmorphic but more like ""moderately insecure"" but other people would maybe type me as body dysmorphic based on the questions they ask me and the answers I give.

As an example: I can't see my body in a mirror. I don't even have a full body mirror. I can't even see pictures or videos of my face without finding flaws in them. 

I also can't go shopping on my own without hating my body afterwards. I also have mixed reactions when seeing my body. One day I feel good about it other days I want to rip my skin off. I also had an compulsive urge to measure myself and weigh myself.

So am I or was I body dysmorphic?! Imo no not at all for me this is normal. For someone else that loves every Inch of their body?! I probably would be in their eyes dysmorphic.

I think it's best to just say the type and not leave any comments on why you think they have that type. If they really want to know they'll ask you in a comment. Imo it's best to say as little as possible and if they get insecure point out that they are beautiful and good enough by putting emphasis on the good attributes of a body type of the body of the person that posted. Compliments never hurt imo but that won't cure their mental illness.

Just be kind I think that's the most we can do."

vaginismus,fky1dwj,t3_flcq04,1584639508.0,"So I was in a similar situation as you a while ago. I was frustrated and dating even now makes me emotionally such a wreck that I decided to lay it off until my therapy is completely finished and I can feel better about myself. (I mean now it's different I got something little going on but it's fresh so idk) 

I noticed that most of the guys I attracted weren't nice because I didn't treat myself nice. I mean hell even now I have severe confidence issues but I can cover them up now and guess what :

My environment especially the ones around guys changed. Being confident and listening to the little things they said made me sort them out very quickly.

About the penetration thing. I agree it does feel often that we are treated as second choices especially when it comes to pleasure in society but when I started masturbating and was giving myself PIV I noticed that I can't get an orgasm from PIV but only clitoral. I do enjoy PIV I enjoy it a lot but I don't come from PIV.

So I don't think it's mainly about ""we don't care just get the guy off"" but rather about ""most women can't come from PIV and that is why we tell you a different solution"".

If you think that you are being treated like a second option in your sexual relationship you should clearly say it and if he doesn't respect it leave.

You don't owe anyone anything g that is true but (ik clich√© af) not all men are assholes. In fact it's the minority. It's just that the bad impressions last the longest. I thought that men only thought that I was only good for sex and nothing else but tbh it wasn't men. It was me myself that made me feel like that.

It wasn't about him HAVING the money but rather that I was feeling uncomfortable how he spent it on me despite me clearly telling him that I don't want it. This is why we set those rules. We both agreed to these terms temporarily but we both are aware that we can't do that forever.
askwomenadvice,fkv2szt,t1_fkuupsg,1584560868.0,"He did volunteer work and donations way before he met me. We both said that right now as a temporary solution it would be better that if he wants to spend money on me we rather donate it to a charity we both want to and do volunteer work when we want to go away for a trip. It's not that I tell him that he HAS to donate the money. It's just that if he wants to spend money on me we rather talk about how we can see it benefit a different group.

As an example rather than spending a lot of money on expensive dresses or jewelry we'll talk first about whether it's really nessecary and if not we'll decide whether or not to just keep it or to donate it.

I don't dictate his spendings whatsoever. It's just that rather him spending money without my knowledge on me he asks me first if I even want that and then we decide together if we both don't see a better use for it somewhere else."

askwomenadvice,fkto2q5,t1_fktnffe,1584528507.0,I have been abused also but I didn't want to put it here because I thought it didn't matte tbh. But I am in therapy thankfully. Dealing with PTSD is a awful

askwomenadvice,fks0iqm,t1_fkryeif,1584479748.0,"It's just that material goods were used to show love in my family because it was very rare for me to get material gifts. The problem with that is that I would have rather spent time with my mom and wanted her to actually listen to me and give me attention. Unfortunately my mother wasn't able to do so because she was always working. She thought that material goods can show me how much she loves me but it didn't.

I also don't want him to pay for me because I have seen a habit of his that I really don't like. Whenever we have a fight and he hurt my feelings he just says something along the lines of ""oh come on don't be mad ill buy you XYZ"" my mom used to do that to me too when I was younger and even back then it made me furious. I just don't want him to think that he has financial power over me because I don't want to be in a relationship where I'm not being seen as equal. If that makes sense

I don't want to be in a relationship where happiness and love is measurable by materialistic things. It makes me scared. It makes me scared because I have the feeling that he only sees me as a doll that he can do with whatever he wants with and he just has to pay me in order to keep me satisfied. 

Idk why but it just bugs me when he tries to pay for me because it feels like I ""owe him"" I know he doesn't think like that and I know that he is a nice guy. But how long can that be? It's a deep rooted fear of mine that people think my feelings are replacable with something."
Kibbe,fkrmqr1,t1_fkriqsb,1584471893.0,I also meant the edwardian era. I'm sorry that was my mistake
Kibbe,fkrmk1x,t1_fkriqsb,1584471788.0,Do you know the movie Jane eyre with Michael Fassbender? I love the aesthetic of the entire movie. :)
Kibbe,fkqx5eh,t3_fk5lxj,1584457452.0,First SN then SD and then SN... I think I'm truly an SN but I didn't get typed by other people
Kibbe,fkq4c7b,t1_fkp0fvo,1584429989.0,Tbh I probably did mean Edwardian and got it mixed up. Embarrassing mistake on my part
Kibbe,fkovksa,t1_fkomkv5,1584395978.0,Should i DM you? But then tomorrow because it's really late rn in my country lol
Kibbe,fkocgfg,t1_fkobcl0,1584384438.0,I didn't know thank you. I just know that Victorian fashion was based in corsets and high necklines and I didn't know if an SN can pull that off since it's stiff:)
YoTroublemakers,fkdferf,t1_fkc301x,1584076847.0,Typo oops. Hunchback ofc lol
vaginismus,fkbt9eg,t3_fh9hsz,1584039434.0,Cured and no bf needed at all just confidence and lube. Therapy helps too tho
vaginismus,fkblw3n,t3_fhit4n,1584035418.0,Have them and not only do they look cute af I really liked them. Also really student budget friendly I'd recommend
Kibbe,fk1jv14,t1_fk1fonn,1583781138.0,Yeah but it only makes sense in inches tbh. What about the girls that use the metric system? Like I'm ranging from 5'5 to 5'6 in some websites now if I'm 5'5 I could easily be a TR but if I'm 5'6 TR is immediately ruled out because of an inch?! That doesn'take sense to me tbh. Which is why I I personally don't follow the height rule or at least very loosely.
Kibbe,fk1epl9,t3_ffv9ny,1583778158.0,"Honestly height is overrated. Your body type does not change just because you are two inches taller or shorter than the test or book says. The theory will never be able to tell you their type just by their height.

Rihanna is a TR and she's tall for a TR. Beyonce is a R and she's apparently too tall for a R. Still both of them are categorized as those types. Please don't take one thing and only follow by that just look at the entire body. Following the rules too strictly doesn't make people type correctly imo."
