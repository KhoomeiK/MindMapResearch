Dogtraining,fhgdhas,t3_f2sg4r,1581564354.0,"Wow, thank you everyone for the support and amazing tips!! My boyfriend and I read through every single one of them and feel so empowered to keep working at this. We talked to the vet today and she gave us some meds that will hopefully help while weâ€™re still in transition and keep everyone sane while weâ€™re working through the behavioral training using all of this advice. 

After a few very emotional days I feel so much more positive and rejuvenated after reading everyoneâ€™s stories, so truly, thank you all. I will share updates on what works for our guy, but for the first time Iâ€™m honestly feeling like we can do this :)"
