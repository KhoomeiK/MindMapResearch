PoliticalDiscussion,fqhjj6v,t1_fqgbghe,1589378261.0,This could very well be a product of a society who sees failure as defeat rather than a step in the process to success. Admitting you don't know something means you're insufficient or less than. We're becoming a culture of people faking it till you make it. I think we're also trying to over compensate for the part of our culture that doesn't emphasize value of self. There's alot of ignoring the emotional part of being human that is turning us into cold and disingenuous people. We need individuality and we need to feel important we need to be healthy mentally. True confidence not arrogance is so important in being able to question yourself and others. Without that we desperately try to find a way to be relevant. We don't know ourselves so we find our identities in politics or other controversial issues. Not that this is the only reason but our American culture is very materialistic and I think we've forgotten everything that makes us human. As a nation we are mentally ill.

I think to an extent the ""spiritual community"" has become in most part seen as a bunch of hokie crazy people. To be honest there are many that are. Many people don't understand meditation and think that they can't because it's too hard. I know even my friend that wants to meditate can't bring herself to find the self discipline or patience to build the practise. Especially in these times it's very hard to focus on your breathing and meditation ends up being more frustrating than relaxing because they don't understand that it's something you have to practice to get into the flow. It takes time. Just let it roll off and let him manage himself  and you do you. You can't control him or what works for him and neither can he. Sending love in these very stressful times."

I dismissed my abuse for 30 years because I kept saying to myself that other people have it worse(physically abusive father). Or kids will be kids(sexually abusive sister). Our unhealthy thought processes aren't something we're born with it's something we're taught. You have mentioned 2 sexual encounters at a younger age that felt unhealthy and wrong to you. That's worth exploring. In my 8 years of trauma therapy and 3 different therapists and proud to say a significant amount of healing, I have never ever been told that people make up trauma and that you should focus on your behaviors now and possible trauma isn't really that important in the process of getting those under control. Knowing that my behaviors are caused by a wounds allows me not to define myself by my dysfunction and gives me a pathway to heal and grow. Even if it's irrational if it feels like it could be important its worth exploring. You might find its not and you might find its related to something you never thought it was but you will never know if you just dismiss it."

I'm 33 and just found out. I had a feeling but couldn't really validate it until I had something to make sense of it. Without memories I just had the affects and everything I found that was attached to my anxiety about sex didn't quite make sense. It was all symptomatic to something earlier on.

 It was through my neverending intense and seemingly unwarranted anger at my sister that made me realize that it was her. Now I don't know wtf to do with myself or my lack of shock. I feel like I should be more surprised but we referred to it as ""pretending to have sex"" which seemed like normal childhood exploration. When it clicked in my head I realized that I have very vivid memories of a time. I was 6 and I remember the blanket on my bed, the light in the room, where my bed was, and certain sounds. I think I blanked the rest out. I'm totally fine with that. I know it happened and am just struggling with how to interact with my family. Due to the physical abuse from my father I already disconnected emotionally from them but now I don't even want to talk to them. 

I guess in some way this pandemic is giving me an opportunity to process things without worry of the next family function. My heart goes out to you.

I 100% agree that inaction is a problem. It spreads far beyond just talking to racist friends and family though.

politics,fo73gf8,t1_fo6qogi,1587571573.0,"That's just an assumption. I will tell you I grew up in one of those white, brainwashed, racist, republican homes. I am not more intelligent if anything I'm far behind. My mother didn't go to school until she was in her late 30s and still voted for Trump. It was an abusive, neglectful and sheltered home. I couldn't dance because we were baptist, my parents listened to nothing but gospel, and I had no friends outside of church( neither did they). I remember I had to write sentences one time for listening to Hanson on MTV. Sexuality was unhealthy and shameful, our image to the congregation was more important than how we treated people especially each other. I'm still seeing ways my upbringing has put me behind from regular developmental stepping stones. It was through abuse, neglect, complete loss of identity, and grieving a family I thought I had that brought me to the political mindset I'm at. Seems strange to be thankful for abuse but without it I worry I might be as close minded as  the many generations of pastors and good christians in my family although they were abused as well. I would love to see some statistics on early childhood development, religion, and the home environment of the educated vs noneducated ( like me) . What determines critical thinking skills vs what doesn't.  Shouldn't we be asking WHY critical thinking seems to be a result of higher education? Why aren't we teaching our children this life skill in school that we collectively pay for? Critical thinking is something WE ALL need  and our education system is failing us if I have to go into great debt or experience trauma to be able to think for myself. Even then what determines the genetic lottery that allows for critical thinking or the need to grow as a person or be open minded? If my trauma shifted my thought process, why didn't it shift my parents? 
Why didn't my mother's higher education at a normal community college help her to be more of  critical thinker? How much of our capitalist American Culture and the overreach of false white washed Christianity in our government ( Let's be honest there isn't a separation of church and state) is responsible for the decline of value in quality education? 

We should be asking these questions if we're going to spout statistics on education as a determining factor for the divide of and decline in America. There are so many factors to why America is here. These statistics just show us we need to start asking more questions so we can figure out HOW we got here and rebuild this country in a more humanitarian way that helps humanity grow as a whole."

depression,fnsmj51,t3_g36yxc,1587224654.0,"Please take the time to hear me out. I dont want to offend anyone but I do need to weigh in here as someone who has found that knowing to be a huge tool in fighting my depression.  I have CPTSD, ADHD, Depression, and I struggle with self harm so believe me when I say I get it. I want to help. 

. I think our perception of depression can be very distorted at times and we all tend to internalize depression to be a large part of who we are. The fact is depression is very much an illness of perception. It lies to us and tells us we are shit, we have no friends, nobody cares about us, life is shit, we will be in this hole forever and nothing we can do will get us out because it's an illness and we are trapped and  powerless. This is what depression is. It challenges our reality. What you know to be real in your healthier times are likely quite contradictory to what your reality is in your depression brain. Depression itself is it's own entity. I like to think of it as a parasite who's mission is to make you believe everything is awful and especially YOU. 

 I 100% support the need for people to just listen sometimes because sometimes advice is the last thing you need, sometimes I just want to feel like I'm seen and heard god damnit. Like I am a real person equal to everyone else. Or to get that negative energy out in some way to lighten the weight of depression in those times. But the idea that it will pass is something you **need** to know. Going back to the fact that depression is an illness of thought and perception I have to say that KNOWING that it will pass, knowing these feelings are distortions is one of my biggest tools to manage my depression and emotional stability. Recognizing it to be lies my illness is telling me gives me power to stand in myself and takes power away from the depression that has a hold on me. I would compare it to when I got anxiety meds for panic attacks. Another tool in the battle. My PTSD means panic attacks get dark fast. They snowball into self harm and suicidal thoughts. Once I got meds just knowing that there was something that could stop it was a game changer. I realized then that not knowing it would stop or how bad it would get before it stopped was a good portion of what fueled the panic attack.  I was powerless and that was terrifying. When I'm in a deep depression the false belief that it will never get better, that I am powerless, unloveable, incapable, fuels my suicidal thoughts pushes me to isolate and inhibits my ability to practice the techniques I have to live by if I am going to manage my way through with minimal damage. 

It's taken me many many ups and downs and sitting in deep dark very lonely holes  for extended periods of time to gain the knowing that it really does pass. It comes back but it will end and I just have to weather the storm and do what I can through my tools and techniques to manage. Once I adapted this practice of being able to check myself my depression became easier to observe rather than fall into. The emotions are still real, I am still sad, I still get angry I still have a tendency to isolate, I still spend days in bed sometimes and I still fight the voice in my head. My brain still tells me the lies but the difference is I KNOW they're lies and that gives me strength to have a plan to manage. It's like PMS and hormones, it's a side effect of the illness not my reality I just have to ride it out and do what I can in therapy and practice my techniques to manage until it does pass. I by no means am saying you should be cool with Karen telling you that you need some sunshine.  However a therapist knows the nature of depression and is just trying to give you some perspective. Assuming that they are a good therapist anyway.  As someone who is in this struggle as well, someone who fights this as a parent and a wife, someone who has to manage my depression if I want to have a life, I get it, but I encourage you to  try to find this knowledge as well. You can paint a picture or create a symbol, or write yourself a letter, just something in your healthier moments to reference in the moments of despair that will remind you that it really is going to pass and all of the worthlessness you're feeling are lies. This is just basic CBT. Like having an anxiety kit for times that can trigger a panic attack. Mindfulness is so important in managing depression. Depression will likely always  be a part of your life but it doesn't have to be so successful. Being objective with the thoughts from your depression and recognizing depression as it's own entity, as an illness of perception, will give you the strength to observe them as just thoughts and not reality. It is a game changer I promise. I'm not trying to get you to ""think positive"" we all know that doesn't work. I'm just trying to encourage you to have this conversation with yourself. To remove yourself from being intertwined with the depression and see it for what it is. An illness, a parasite who's only objective is to make you feel alone and worthless and it's winning. Just like in the movies when you realize it's not reality it loses power over you to an extent. I implore you to try to challenge those perceptions and gain strength through mindfulness. It has changed my relationship with myself and the gravity of depression's hold on my life.. But this isn't something anyone else can do by telling you, you are the only one who can build this tool in the battle. 

My heart goes out to everyone struggling, I know it's a hard time for many of us on top of our usual battle. You are NOT your depression and it does not define you. You are stronger than you think. You are loved and you are valued."

Here's a few videos from around the world about how other countries view us. I've come to the conclusion that much of our mental health crisis in America is due to our shit cultural dynamic. Consensus is that we are friendly but fake about it. Our friendships are shallow and we are superficial. Although Russians and Australians seem to like us alright. Anyway I know it helps me to realize that not all humans are extroverts and I'm just different but that American culture is shallow and disingenuous.

 Our culture doesn't support being anything but what fits in the little box that is the patriotic American who is outgoing and friendly but beneath it there's just so much fakeness. We've a all experienced this personally. I've kind of given up on making friends because of the fact that every time I think I make friends it turns out the friendship wasn't a genuine connection. In a country of people who are encouraged to be fake being a real person with real feelings makes it hard to be yourself. Anyway going beyond our borders has definitely helped me gain some perspective on what part of my depression is fueled by our societal construct of dismissing mental health and ""not airing your dirty laundry in public"" . Just know that it's not the whole world. You aren't weird or strange we're just contrasting to the cliche American."

progressive,fm56poh,t1_fm4qqzz,1585767336.0,"This is all part of advertising and his campaign doesn't run like all the others. Email and texts are the number one way they communicate with their base. It's annoying but also not being done with malice so what's the big deal?

I would imagine the reason Bernie's campaign and ActBlue didn't raise any flags about it is because there's a global pandemicwith few supplies, he's running for president, fighting for our livelihood, still a senator, and raising funds for pandemic relief. Email injustice isn't really top op the list right now. 

If you really were donating I encourage you to rethink WHY you were donating that money. The causes of what that money went to fund and ask yourself if spam is a good reason to opt out of this important time in history. 

I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and sane."

progressive,fm4q2hs,t1_fm4m21l,1585758723.0,Yep I guess so. Sorry you have a sour taste in your mouth because of it. I don't think anyone is doing it with malice. I've donated quite a few times and I get many text messages but you have to remember his campaign relies on small donations so people regularly donating small amounts more often is something they need constantly which is why they ask for it. I encourage you not to let emails deter you from the fabric of the policies and the reason you donated. 500 is a lot in my world and if you believe in something that much its confusing to me that you would just write someone off because you're getting more emails than you'd like after donating a larger amount than usual to a campaign. Just seems like a strange thing to write someone off for if you're donating that much to a political cause. You could just mark it as spam like with anything else you put your email into and go on with your day knowing you contributed to someone who's trying to fight for your quality of life. Did they tell you there was no way to unsubscribe?
progressive,fm4eh8r,t3_fs1jh1,1585752532.0,"I just take it as part of the campaigning process. You can block the emails or mark them as spam.

depression,fm0r2zl,t3_fs78rp,1585664474.0,"This is really long but I have struggled with this so hard and I ran a support group for sensitive people for a time so I hope I can help. 

 For the longest time I felt exactly like you do. It would just be easier to isolate and stop trying to make friends because I always felt like I needed to be someone else if anyone was going to love me as family, friends, or romantically. Then every time I thought I made a friend they were just fair weather friends. There was no such thing as people who would accept me as I am, or understand what life is like as a sensitive. I needed to conform. I always got extra depressed after hanging out with people because I over analyzed my every move and felt inferior and like I didn't belong.  Even as an adult my family thinks I'm a drama queen just for talking about problems if they arise and I dare not openly talking about feelings. I cant tell you how many times in my life I've been told I'm too sensitive and need thicker skin. I'm constantly at risk of harsh judgement (I live in the midwest) and eventually learned my ""family"" is something I can chose throughout life and I'd been surrounding myself with people who didn't understand mental illness or believe in it and were typically very uncomfortable being genuine people and having deep emotional  conversations. I struggle with self harm and when that was a big issue boy did I find out just how emotionally avoidant people really are. 

  I have 1 friend in particular who is one of the most interesting people I know. She works for the airlines traveled all around the world. Professional photographer for Aspen, art installer at a well known museum, and so so much more. She always seems so confident and always so up to date on style trends, she's intelligent and outgoing. She always had so many amazing friends and although we'd been friends for 10+ years I still felt inadequate like I was the insecure person who didn't belong. Turns out her and the people I kept thinking were too cool to like me had the same insecurities they just hid it really fucking well. Being hip was something she felt she had to do to belong, in fact alot of what she does is in some part to belong. 

Nobody is immune to the human condition of needing to belong. We all do. We're coded to need a community and acceptance. If you live in America it's safe to say we were all brought up in a society that doesn't teach the role emotions play in our lives (pull yourself up by your bootstraps) or place any priority on mental health. Our society has been also been conditioned to pretend to be perfect. Instagram, facebook, most pop culture, commercials, I mean look at the people who are struggling with quarantine just because they can't go get their hair done. The Kardashians for fuck sake. American culture does not support the emotional side of being human and is structured to make us feel inadequate so that we will buy whatever product to make us perfect. It's slowly become part of who our people are.

 This is how I realized that I am not the one who isn't working right. We are the people who were born sensitive in contrast to a society that's been desensitized and emotionally shut down. American culture doesn't support humanitarian values and it's hard to watch it happen and pretend to be ""normal""  So many people have unresolved trauma leaving them either angry or just pretending because being genuine is not valued like it should be. We need to fit in to survive in America. We don't operate from knowledge that our differences are necessary and we should celebrate or uniqueness to be utilized for the community. Not to say there aren't healthy people out there but being a sensitive person has been quite a struggle in our ass backwards culture and I've run into alot of just shitty friends and went through a few years of isolation. Through therapy and inner child work I've learned that we were actually born healthy. We actually feel on a real level. That means we feel the beauty of the sunshine more than others but unfortunately we also feel the great depths of sadness, and if you're like me that means other people's suffering too. It's taken me some time and some rewiring of my brain but I feel strongly now that we are of the lucky few that were born to feel in a world that doesn't feel. Yes that makes us different and it makes  those ""how's the weather"" conversations excruciating as so many people are disingenuous and we crave genuine people who dont judge.  I don't think people are all bad by any means, just that our culture doesnt support a healthy mind body and spirit and that has left so much of America unwell. In the past we would be the healers of the tribe, we would be more emotionally aware of the conditions of our people and how to help heal using herbs and intuition. Just like those with ADHD would be the people who were more aware and alert to keep the tribe physically safe. I have had to accept that people are rarely going to understand the depths of what I feel except maybe others who were born the same way. My husband is also sensitive but  because he hasn't processed his pain it turns into anger or cynicism. He tries really hard to keep people away for fear of being hurt. He's in the process of healing though.

On a daily basis I have to be careful about what I watch and where I go. I spent the last few years trying to surround myself with people who understand mental illness, although there arent many in my circle. I treasure the few I do have. I even ended up running a support group for sensitive people for a time.  You'd be surprised how many people struggle with being sensitive in such a harsh world. We just hide out and feel exactly how you feel so we stay in the shadows. 

Just try not to let yourself feel like there's something wrong with you. There's not. Yes things hurt really really bad sometimes , ok alot but that also allows us to experience those really good things on a level others can't. Our capacity is larger on both ends of the spectrum we just get stuck in that dark hole sometimes and can't see the other end. There are people like you out there that will get it the tricky part is finding them. I still get depressed but I can at least stand against the idea that something is wrong with me for being sensitive and know it's a societal construct. It's not a malfunction it's a part of being human. I hope you find some comfort and maybe gain some perspective to help you feel less like an outcast and more like a gifted individual, even though it comes with it's own struggles. Sending love and apologies again for the length."
PoliticalDiscussion,fly9zco,t1_flti0rk,1585598258.0,"I understand how you feel. I question if he'll be held accountable as well. I'm treating it like my fear of what will happen when my daughter is a teenager and just categorizing it as a ""we'll cross that road when we come to it"" situation. There's so much going on right now in our personal lives with COVID19 already, just try to manage what you can so you don't get overwhelmed stressing about the what ifs. I believe in some kind of karma like payback and that man has done so much that the universe will balance it back out for him in some way. Sending love to you in these trying times<3"

Many of us hate what our country is doing but so many others are deceived into or choose to believe an alternate reality where we are heroes. Americans have been told for so long that our vote doesn't matter and have seen that the good guys cant win. Most of our youth doesn't even see a point in voting because the machine is so big and so powerful. Many are facing sever depression because of the world they are growing up in. My parents were tricked into believing the American dream. I don't want this. I know many others who don't want this. We are losing against the propaganda machine, even now.

Politics are treated as a hobby in America and we seem to believe politics don't have any real role in our daily lives. The bread and circus successfully convinced most of the country that domestic politics doesn't even matter or have any affects in our daily lives. Within those people many of them don't even pay attention to foreign affairs. Watching the choices being made in our primaries should be enough to see that we aren't against what's going on. We think this is normal and acceptable. Maybe not trump because he's just too brazen but the normal way business is done in America is accepted. Lobbying, profiteering, and manufactured consent are how our country has been run for decades now. While abusing our military to start wars to increase public funding and take what they want. If Hilary won we wouldn't be any better a country. Trump is what happens when a country stops asking questions and lets those in power make decisions for us because we can't get off our couch to give a shit. This has been going on for decades."
