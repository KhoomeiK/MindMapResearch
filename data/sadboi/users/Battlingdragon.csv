AskReddit,fr1s99t,t3_gm0bz9,1589825066.0,"I once locked my mom's keys in the trunk of her car, instead of the stuffed animal in my other hand. 

I was about 8 years old, and we were at the local fair, in the early 90s. My brother or I had won a stuffed animal at one of the games and wanted to put it in the car so we didn't have to carry it all night. Mom was working at the local fire departments food stand and couldn't leave, so she gave me the keys and told me to put it in the trunk. I opened the trunk, pulled the keys out of the lock, threw them in and slammed it closed in about 5 seconds. And then realized I still had the toy in my hand. 

It took three hours for Dad to get there with the other set of keys since cell phones were about 10 years from being even remotely common."

The US hasn't made a single Purple Heart medal, awarded to every soldier wounded in combat, since 1945. We're still using the ones that were made in preparation for invading Japan. 

The Battle of Iwo Jima was two months long and there 45,000 casualties total. The US had 26,000 soldiers killed or wounded in two months on Iwo Jima. The entire Vietnam War killed 56,000. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are at 57,000 killed or wounded. The island only had 20,000 soldiers on it and recieved no reinforcements or supplies during those two months. How many more would have died if we'd had to march troops into the heart of Japan, with vastly greater numbers, manufacturing facilities, and civilians everywhere?

Fully automatic means one pull of the trigger can fire more than one round.  Burst fire and select fire are full auto. Civilians cannot purchase any fully automatic firearm produced after 1986, and to purchase one requires a $200 tax, an ATF  approval, and finding one for sale. The cheapest ones cost over $10,000 because of how limited the supply is. Police departments can get them for less than $1,500 each, and they're getting current equipment, not Vietnam era M16s. Converting any semi auto to full is a huge felony. 

Walk into any gun store and ask how much for a burst or select fire gun. You're either going to get laughed out of the store, or given a price of at least ten grand and a probable one year wait for the paperwork to clear.
