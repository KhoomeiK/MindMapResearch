This has become a serious problem for me.

For the last few months though, nothing other than work seems to be enough to get me out of bed. I get up for work because I can’t afford to lose my job (even though I hate it most days), but on days off? I probably get up around 5-6 pm, and even then only because one of my parents calls me to make sure I’m up before they arrive to pick me up for supper at their place. I’m not asleep the whole time; there just isn’t anything else in my life that’s worth getting up for. There are lots of days that I’ve had plans, things that I really wanted to do, but instead, I just lay there. I hate it so much!
