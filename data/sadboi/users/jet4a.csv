BPD,fhj7qb8,t3_f3gzvk,1581639671.0,I was literally just thinking about this. For some reason I can’t form proper sentences when i talk to people (except my closest friends). And its weirdly even worse around my family. I know its not some speech problem since i speak normally around my friends but I genuinely have no idea what is causing this

relationships,fg4dqfa,t3_ewl0xl,1580501590.0,"That is so creepy. It wouldnt be weird if he  touched your hand & moved it away immediately, but seems like he knew what he was doing since he tried to hold your hand. In my opinion you should tell your cousin immediately. If he tried to do this to you, he might’ve done it to other girls and your cousin doesn’t deserve that"
relationships,fg49wj0,t3_ewk3i2,1580499251.0,"Seems like her insecurity and depression are leading her to make unstable and weird decisions. Talk to her and either convince her to go to therapy for her depression, or go to a couple’s therapist."
relationships,fg47yt7,t3_ewssky,1580498066.0,"Seems to me that her mom is pressuring her to pursue something that she doesn’t want to do and she’s scared of being honest with her. If i were you, i’d talk to your niece and ask her what she really wants to do. If it turns out that her mom is forcing her into this tennis thing, i feel like i’d be better to talk to your brother about it instead of his wife since she will probably think you‘re jealous of her daughter’s “talents” or that you have bad intentions or something."
BPD,ffcoahe,t3_esuysh,1579803704.0,"Happy birthday & please dont hurt yourself! People come and go and at the moment youre surrounded by people who don’t treat you right so i think that you were right for cutting them off. However, im sure that one year from now you’re going to find at least one person who appreciates you and who makes life worth living, so please keep going!!!!!!"
Anxiety,fdebb7q,t3_eku664,1578335277.0,Same here. Missed a lot of opportunities because of anxiety and at this point im pretty sure im never going to achieve anything in my life because anxiety is holding me back
astrology,fdb9tir,t3_ekbstn,1578255259.0,"Not really. My ruler is Uranus but ive always been drawn to the moon but it makes sense cause the majority of my chart is ruled by it (im a cancer sun, mercury, mars, venus). I’ve always really liked saturn tho, which is the old ruler of aquarius"
BPD,fdb2ol5,t1_fdb1we0,1578253088.0,Yeah exactly!! I feel like depressed me and okay me are two whole different people. When i look back on stuff i do or say when depressed i feel weirded out and uncomfortable. Its so weird
BPD,fdaxrsa,t3_ekgfzb,1578251634.0,"Watching movies with those sort of themes when im feeling bad makes me feel accepted and less alone, but when im feeling okay it just makes me feel uncomfortable or makes me feel like shit. Depends on the movie and mood i guess"

I think i have a very bubbly personality and all my friends think im very sweet and funny, but whenever im around my family I either don’t talk at all or say cruel stuff which i never do around my friends. I feel like they bring out the worst in me and it sucks"

LGBTeens,f81zdtx,t3_dy9xgz,1574180684.0,"ask them about their favorite artists and movies. lgbt+ people usually have really specific gay interests lol. Also, casually ask them if they’re homophobic or just slightly mention a gay topic to see their reaction. Hope this helps!"

relationships,f6sch8v,t1_f6sb1mu,1573131680.0,Yeah that’s true
relationships,f6saviz,t1_f6s6znf,1573130768.0,"Thanks for the advice, I’ll definitely check her out! Also, the beating thing is complicated. It only happened because my family members convinced her she’s a bad parent because i had difficulty falling asleep & i guess she thought hitting me would solve that. Spoiler alert, it didn’t help and i still have trouble sleeping and stay up a lot. my family still think that that’s the most abnormal thing in the world even though i get at least 5 hours of sleep on the daily. But I guess the the beating thing didn’t go on for long and wasn’t as bad as it sounds because I didn’t even know that it happened more than once until my aunt mentioned it a few years ago. The only thing i remember is crying myself to sleep a few times as a child which i guess was because of her hitting me. My mom starts crying whenever this comes up and she constantly tells me she deeply regrets it though and I believe her"
relationships,f6s8mre,t1_f6relo2,1573129447.0,I guess i talk that way because it’s easier than admitting that my parents’ behavior has caused me such trauma. Thanks a lot for the advice though! I’ll work on accepting myself and my trauma!
relationships,f6s8d4w,t1_f6rb9s3,1573129290.0,Thank you for the advice! This whole process seems very hard but I’m going to make effort to talk to her about it and try to resolve all of this. I’m also very glad to hear that your relationship with your mother improved!
