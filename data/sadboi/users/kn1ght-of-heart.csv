If this date has such bad associations tied to it, why not change it? Of course you wouldn’t be able to actually do so legally, but you could always just think of it as a different day. I encourage you to talk about this more in depth in therapy, I know you said that it hasn’t helped, but perhaps you just haven’t approached it from the right angle. Also, it’s not your fault that you missed the funeral, you had no idea what had happened at the time. Maybe you can honor his memory in another way, maybe do something that he would’ve liked to do in his stead, or visit where he was buried (if he was buried).
