Anxiety,fr1iikq,t3_glslqw,1589820320.0,"It's a scary and isolating time for a lot of people, you're not alone in feeling that way! I have anxiety and depression and while I take medication, I had a similar experience. I was isolated for 3 solid weeks with doctor's notes, I caught some kind of debilitating stomach bug/gastroenteritis at the worst possible time and simply had to wait it out. The illness itself came on suddenly and going to the ER produced no answers and very little relief, so that in itself caused my anxiety to skyrocket. During that time the few excursions I made out for groceries or medicine were incredibly difficult. I'm usually somewhat uncomfortably anxious in public places, but the lack of practice/exposure over that time made it so much harder. I eventually was well enough to return to work, but even after a couple weeks back I'm still readjusting. 

I have a lot of fear and dread surrounding being ill in public, and leading up to my leave from work I had episodes at work where I had to leave after only 45 minutes into a shift, or co-workers saw me writhing in pain. At one point my sister had to pick me up and drive me home. It was basically my personal nightmare come to life, and even now I don't know the cause and in the back of my mind I'm afraid it will return and upend my life all over again. I felt ashamed to be sick, weak, and afraid, and at the same time I was terrified that my bosses and coworkers would think I was overreacting or making it up. But, I think just taking that first step, and getting out no matter how scary is truly the hardest part, and even if you have to take baby steps, it's better than being a prisoner to your fears. I can only speak for myself, but I have found comfort in my experience over the years that I now know my anxiety over just about any situation is worse than anything I've actually had to experience. As much as I hated getting sick at work, and making a spectacle of myself while enduring terrible pain and being very afraid, looking back I know it wasn't that bad, and no one who matters thinks any less of me for it. I also know that I am stronger than I give myself credit for, and I think that is something that applies to many people. You are stronger than you know! Sometimes we just have to remind ourselves of that.

  
If you haven't tried it, I recommend EFT tapping, it's simple and easy to practice- though I usually go to the bathroom to do it so I don't draw attention to myself. It has helped me a lot, and might be worth a try. Good luck!"

Albuquerque,fqiartn,t3_giu0nx,1589393456.0,"I work for a big box retailer and unfortunately everyday I see more and more people abandoning the notion of social distancing. Yes, there are people still doing it, and yes the majority of people are wearing some kind of mask, but now I'm seeing entire families out shopping again, instead of just one or two people. There's also teens and young adults coming in groups of 3+ and you know they aren't all siblings, and I rarely see younger people wearing masks (at least when they're hanging out together, in my observation). All of this is very concerning, as we haven't really gotten a handle on the virus or the infection rate but instead people are feeling a false sense of security and they're frankly just getting bored. I think the measures we took considering we didn't have such a high rate initially were what's helped keep the infection rate low and the hospitals from overflowing, and that kind of diligence is the only thing that will work until there is a vaccine. Opening restaurants and gyms and such, even with limiting capacity, will only undo the progress we're trying to make. And seeing as how people are already abandoning safety precautions to go out and look at swimsuits and flip flops, I don't think they will be cautious enough."

tarantulas,f37s3uw,t3_dfqzm4,1570729606.0,"GBB for sure. I've had mine from a sling and she's had beautiful color changes every moult. She's a delight to feed and watch.  I put a little aquarium bridge in her enclosure and she likes to hide in there about half the time, the rest she's out and about.  The best part is when she pops out for crickets like a goddamn troll and drags them under the bridge lol"

AmItheAsshole,f2651wh,t3_dby7xn,1569993759.0,"NTA assuming you really didn't know how severe her allergy is.  Having such a sensitivity really places the burden on her, and if you didn't bring PB into the office itself, then I don't think you should be held liable.  I do, however, think you might consider talking to her in private and telling her you think you may have accidentally caused the allergic reaction and apologizing.  I only suggest this not to place blame but because as someone who suffers from some very serious food allergies (though not as sensitive as your coworker) an allergic reaction is very painful and very scary.  I know I would want to at least know why it happened even after the fact, just for my own peace of mind.  Again, I don't think you should be pressured to compensate her if it was truly an honest mistake, but if it were me, apologizing for the pain you caused and promising to be more mindful would be very appreciated."

Fuck Michelle. Her ""phobia"" isn't your problem.  Especially when she lets her dog run wild when other people are uncomfortable.  This is a silly argument and a ridiculous situation but you've bonded in your own way with a harmless creature. If she truly has a phobia she needs to get that shit under control HERSELF and not expect people around her to validate her IRRATIONAL fear.  I've had crippling depression and anxiety for more than 15 years, you wanna guess how many people accommodate me? Fuck all.  And that is to be expected.  Those are MY issues, and my responsibility to sort out and still show up and function at work.  She doesn't like a little spider in the corner? Tough shit. There's billions of spiders out in the world.  If she's so afraid she can wrap herself in plastic and never leave her home ffs."
AmItheAsshole,f1aw2os,t1_f1ary3r,1569310253.0,"There are a lot of CLAIMS of brown recluse bites, not many confirmed.  A staph infection or infected insect bite can do similar damage.  Everyone knows someone who was supposedly bitten by a brown recluse but the fact is they are small, non-aggressive, and are RECLUSIVE as one might expect. Google images doesn't mean proof.  In any case, the spider in the office is almost certainly not capable of a medically significant bite, and if she avoids it at all costs, she'll never have to worry about interacting with it and risking a bite."

TalesFromRetail,eyvi1xw,t3_cyq6l4,1567495393.0,"I had just spent a solid 45 minutes folding all of the graphic tees in my section when a mom and teenage daughter walk up. The girl opens up a shirt then starts folding it back up when the mom stops her  
Mom: What are you doing?

Girl: Folding the shirt to put it back?

Mom: What for? \*takes the shirt from her, crumples it up, and chucks it on the nicely folded pile, then gestures at me, about 15 feet away\* Make her work for her money.

Like, really? Lady, your daughter is a decent person and it's clear that has NOTHING to do with you."

offmychest,exu183n,t3_cu88a5,1566577954.0,"I can't imagine how hard and terrifying that must be. You're a good dad, you know what you need to do. But remember the future unfolds one day at a time, and you already handled day one like a boss! I can't say I have any real world advice, since I've never experienced anything like what you're going through, but I think it's ok for her to see that her dad is scared sometimes. My family was very repressed, I grew up thinking my fears and anxieties were only in me and it alienated and frightened me more. You need to be strong for her but maybe it is a valuable thing for her to see that you are also human and also a afraid sometimes and in spite of that fear you are pushing on and not letting it dictate your life.  Just my two cents, good luck to you and your daughter, she's lucky already to have such a great father!"
