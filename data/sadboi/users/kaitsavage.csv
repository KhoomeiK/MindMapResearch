Sims4,fhrzb3d,t3_epyo8p,1581845952.0,Yeah over half the time whims won’t work (I know you can turn them off but I like them on) so I’ll complete a task and will never get any aspiration points from it. It’s a small complaint but annoying.

Something abusers like to do is tell you that they’ll change, or they’ll never hit you again, or that they are so sorry, but nothing ever changes. My mom never got help. She’s still emotionally abusive. Every time I see her we do the same patterns. It’s taken me years to see how bad it was. Get away from him, take care of yourself, and don’t listen to him if he pleads with you to come back. I know this response is filtered through my own bias, but as a person who has been abused, I just want you to be safe."

unpopularopinion,ffppyr7,t3_erx2x0,1580101670.0,"Huh. I actually have never thought about this, but you make a good point. Christianity is pretty tame I guess comparatively. I guess it’s the devil we know? Since a lot of us on here are Americans and have experienced Christianity firsthand? I don’t know, maybe since Christianity is kind of familiar, we find it easy to criticize it?"
