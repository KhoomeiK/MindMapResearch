unpopularopinion,fg8sgg2,t1_fg8saof,1580628934.0,It was definitely excessive! That's why I made the decision to get sober. It was easy per say but it wasnt that difficult for me either. Overall I'm happy to be sober and don't regret that phase in my life
unpopularopinion,fg8o5kj,t1_fg8o4io,1580626236.0,Which part?
unpopularopinion,fg8o500,t1_fg8nzpb,1580626218.0,"I was living with my parents at the time who are both really strict. They don't believe in mental illnesses or anything like that and pushed me hard to not be ""lazy"" when I was suffering from severe ADD. It was nearly impossible to open up to them and see a psychiatrist, which is looked down upon in my family. So I guess I took it upon myself to find my own means of ""self help."""

I have done extensive therapy over this and have recently forgiven her. My therapist said to see feelings as a gift. ""Wrap up your feelings, hand them to your mother without expectations about her response. Tie them with a bow."" That's how I brought myself to confront my mother head-on and tell her that her views on EDs are dead wrong. I didn't expect the response I wanted, but I did my part. Best of luck."

I try and be grateful."
