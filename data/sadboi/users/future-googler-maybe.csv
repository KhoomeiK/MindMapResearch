adjective

relating to homosexual women or to homosexuality in women.

""a lesbian relationship""

Again, this second definition also says *women* exclusively. Words have meaning dude. What's the point in even using these terms at all if we're going to twist them to fit any form? I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just saying that logically a nonbinary lesbian doesn't make any sense."

They do not fit the definition.

Therefore the word doesn't apply, come up with a new term to describe the concept.

And don't compare transphobia to me just saying by definition that this is not lesbianism. They can identify as non-binary and also like girls, I'm not saying they can't. I'm just saying they're not a *lesbian* because that's simply not what the word means."

noun

a homosexual woman.




Not everything has to be complicated. It's a woman who exclusively likes other women. If you don't identify as a woman, lesbianism does not apply. Like.. it's pretty simple actually. If they need a new word to describe it, then come up with a new word, but using the word lesbian this way doesn't make sense."

I personally do not see this as universally true. It's true in SOME cases, like you should be allowed to die if you want to, but plenty of people want to continue their lives and I think that's fine as long as they don't drag anyone else into it you know?

I would hiss at people, stuff like that. I was the weird kid lol. So that's how I would deal with my feelings of being a cat back then.

As I've grown up the feeling has faded a bit but it is still very much part of me. I've become okay with being human, I don't want to be a cat entirely anymore. If I could choose, I'd still have a cat ears and tail on an otherwise human figure, but that's about it. (Sometimes I wear a cat tail and ears in private to make myself feel like I really do have these limbs, as weird as that is. Also sometimes I behave as a cat when I'm alone because it comforts me.) All that being said, I understand that I am 100% human and that's not going anywhere. I'm actually glad I'm human in some ways because I can have more of an impact on everything than an animal typically can. I can make the world a better place as a human. I guess there's not much to ""cope with"" except for the occasional longing to purr or something, but that's no big deal. When you've been dealing with it as long as I have, it becomes something you barely even think about at a certain point.
