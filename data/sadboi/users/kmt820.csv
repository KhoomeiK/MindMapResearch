depression,fj1xvcu,t3_far3w5,1582930257.0,"it’s so fucking bad, it hurts so much sometimes that i feel like i’m going crazy. even when i want to make friends i try but i just feel like i never fit in. i’m always an outsider in social situations and i usually start to develop feelings for guys who are just nice to me. i can’t tell if i genuinely like them or if i’m desperate but i guess it doesn’t really matter in the end because how i feel about them is always unrequited. i’m slowly forgetting how it feels to be loved or wanted."

I mean I’ve thought of it so many times and I’ve even planned it out but never gone through with it. It’s a little strange now that i think of it."

depression,fe069b4,t3_enhbzz,1578804112.0,i think people who aren’t diagnosed but do have a lot of the symptoms for depression are still just as important. i have a friend who talks to me about how she feels and i think she is depressed but i’m not sure she’s ready to tell her family. i just barely mustered up the courage to tell my mom i need to go to my psychiatrist. it’s not always easy to talk about it especially if you’ve tried before but nothing is done to help you. welcome! and hang in there buddy
