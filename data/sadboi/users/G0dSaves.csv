Once on lithium I was able to drop my sex addiction, marijuana addiction, tobacco addiction, vaping addiction everything slowly came off. Lithium really helped me feel normal for once. Maybe your drug addictions stemmed from your undiagnosed bipolar. I was undiagnosed for about 10 years and that’s how long I was addicted to everything I had. Please do yourself a favor and take the second chance seriously. Stick to taking your medicine, it will balance out and your body will get use to it and you will see life get better for you. You have to will it. Diving into your faith will help also to establish a good foundation to grow on. It’s only up from here. You can do this!"

When your on a quest for the Truth it takes more then just that. The young mans filling in some extremely dense gaps to the Truth that need precision explanation. For each answer 10 more correlations emerge. You’ve grown up in a generation of partial tid-bits to come to conclusions. The Truth doesn’t work that way.  Reading the God Delusion doesn’t make you an atheist, for most it may. But remember what distinguishes us from the monkeys is reason, the question ‘why?’ You will be asking it for the rest of your existence. Don’t stop searching for the Truth.

There’s one philosophers philosophy I follow. I have what is known as wisdom, this deeply bothers you. I believe in something you can’t see or touch. I follow the rules of God, remain in a state of Grace, and am in constant communication with him. I can discern right and wrong and what to do next by listening to him, not me. I am virtuous.  If you don’t understand this concept, that doesn’t bother me. But I don’t need someone else’s ideas and questioning of wether this is true or not. I’ve found the truth, the truth, when I found

I can withstand anything. I like to read books, I’ll look into your recommendations though. What’s a strawman? Miracles??? Because science can’t explain it doesn’t mean it did not occur.

DebateReligion,fb88xu3,t3_ebpv42,1576608719.0,"Modern natural science has almost completely abandoned this distinction between the order of creation and the natural order, or the order of providence. Ironically, however, 21st-century natural science has amply confirmed the reasonableness of this distinction. For example, in the field of genetics, natural scientists have learned a great deal about the transmission and variation of genetic information, but no scientist has observed the spontaneous appearance of a new genetic program, such as would be needed to produce a new organ, like an eye or an ear, in an organism that lacked such an organ. Instead, 21st-century genetics has revealed that, far from evolving or increasing in functionality, genetic information degrades and devolves over time, at a rate that, in the words of one geneticist, places “a limit on the length of vertebrate lineages” – a limit much lower than the ages assigned to them by evolutionary theory. Indeed, the discoveries of 21st-century genetics have been fatal to all current hypotheses of human evolution, as they demonstrate that it would be impossible for a common ancestor of chimpanzees and men to acquire the necessary “beneficial mutations” without acquiring a greater number of deleterious mutations – a number that would lead to extinction long before human evolution was achieved."
