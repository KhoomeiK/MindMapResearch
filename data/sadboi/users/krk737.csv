90dayfianceuncensored,fqggpgm,t1_fqgee7w,1589345820.0,True also you‚Äôd think for someone who‚Äôs so obsessed with Ukraine and it‚Äôs women that he‚Äôd ..... learn the language.....
90DayFiance,fqdz1k9,t1_fqd3owy,1589299042.0,I mean come on we know a hot Ukrainian girl who lives in Kiev must have no friends! She‚Äôs so lonely so she goes on these apps to talk to people just for fun and is definitely not being paid!!
90DayFiance,fq8gvmo,t1_fq6864p,1589165907.0,Oh yeah‚Äî Usman is definitely a scammer in his own right. Different kind of scammer than the typical Nigerian stereotype though haha
90DayFiance,fq8gsz1,t1_fq6gvl1,1589165862.0,"Yeah I‚Äôm thinking more along the lines of it being a Nigerian stereotype. Like, Usman had to qualify his statements with I‚Äôm a musician and that‚Äôs the industry I know about. I know there‚Äôs scams but I don‚Äôt know much. That‚Äôs the part I felt bad for him about.

I‚Äôm also an American who lives abroad and people asking if I love Trump is tiring. I get the American stereotypes and will speak to the crazies from my country, but it sucks to always have to qualify that I‚Äôm not one of them."

I just think it's shitty to bring Usman in to talk about scamming just because he's Nigerian. Usman may have missed the mark trying to say the scam wasn't Nigerian, but it was sad that he had to keep defending himself and how he's no in on those things."

He texted me his suicide note on my birthday. I'd called the cops on him a few times for wellness checks that summer, but he had never gone with them to the hospital. I was in a play when I got the text and didn't bother to call the police since I received the message so late from when he sent it.
