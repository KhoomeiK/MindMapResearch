EatingDisorders,fi1mxvy,t1_fhzjni0,1582060863.0,"I’m going to see my therapist tomorrow and I’m going to entertain it in a serious way. I’ve been thinking about it every day and I’m facing the problem where it’s a hit or miss if I can actually safely start eating again on my own, which was part of the original concern. Does it make you feel weird/does it change anything? I just got all of the inflammation out of my body from being sick and the thought of an IV potentially doing the same thing skeeves me out a little bit. I have an interview for an internship on Thursday that I just need to get through and then I understand that I have to make a plan moving forward."
EatingDisorders,fhtx244,t1_fhtvq68,1581879371.0,"Shit. Then is it okay for me to start eating on my own, or should I wait until I can go to a doctor? I don’t see my therapist again until Wednesday, but she told me to shoot her a text if I change my mind about going. I would really, really love to not have her be dealing with this on a weekend/her own time. I also still have a huge aversion to going to a doctor with this issue feat. an irrational fear of needles to contribute to my apprehension. If it’s a quick thing, I can keep my mouth shut and spaz our afterwards, but I don’t do well with IV’s."
EatingDisorders,fhsm93u,t1_fhpbd9j,1581862684.0,"Yeah, originally this started because I have an autoimmune disorder and my doctor suggested a 3 day fast (not aware of any eating problems) in order to clear whatever caused a flare up out of my system. He told me I should break it with bone broth and cooked vegetables, then nuts and eggs, then introduce proteins in order to be safe. I just haven’t been able to break the fast."
EatingDisorders,fhsiqyd,t1_fhqrgaj,1581861403.0,"How long does it take to get an IV start to finish?
I’ve been okay with fluids. I’ve been drinking large amounts of Gatorade zero along with sodium water in the morning in addition to the normal water I drink. I guess the thing that’s making it hard is that I don’t feel bad? In the past, doing this kind of thing eventually made me feel horrible around the second day and I would stop and eat something, even if it wasn’t a lot."
