Does she make it a habit to hang out with people she doesn't like? 

She likes you! If she is deserving of your friendship she will be reasonable and accept it as a mistake. 

Try taking your mind off of it for a while. Go clean your room. Read a book. Go for a nice (socially distant) walk. And breathe deeply. Our bodies react to anxiety by breathing shallowly, and shadow breathing exacerbates anxiety. 

And also, ""This is so stupid."" No, no it isn't. It isn't, and you're not. Let's make sure that's understood. We who suffer anxiety sometimes have difficulty gauging the severity of the situation we're in and respond in an exaggerated manner, but it's far from stupid. It's not even uncommon.
