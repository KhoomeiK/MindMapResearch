First, specifically to /r/AskHistorians, I appreciate the mods and the subreddit quality you have put together. This is not meant as a complaint about this particular subreddit's rules.

That said, I really believe that reddit needs a place for the users to be able to talk about a particular subreddit without having to bend to the whims of that subreddit's mods.  There are numerous examples on the site of communities that are heavily censored by the mod teams.  In some tiny private sub that might not be a big deal, but in large subs that have a very specific name that is the first option people think of for a topic, it really is.  I've said before that reddit should have an option for users to be able to replace/impeach moderators that are not acting in the best interests of the community.  (Again, not talking about the /r/AskHistorians  mods)

All that said, I approve of your approach here.  Certainly reddit should not be indicating that the /r/AskHistorians mods are moderating or even approve of the chat if you have no control over it.  And any new feature that doesn't include an opt out option is a mistake (don't get me started on the new page layout... I'm still on old.reddit.com ).  And the response of ""Go away, we're deleting your post for complaining"" is an insult to a team that moderates one of the best subreddits on the platform."

I get he/she is fighting the snake.  OK.  Are the tiger stripe portions part of the main subject, or another enemy?  They blend together, but not everywhere.  I think it's all the main subject, but then I'm confused by why he/she is grasping his own foot at the top of the image."

DnD,ff6pglp,t3_erxo4l,1579632144.0,"It's fine for the players to want to explore their backstories, or side stories, or the main story.  Let them.  If you have a narrative that you really want to push (which isn't necessarily a good idea if the players aren't bought into it), you can just move the narrative into the stories they are actually pursuing.

As an example, our DM wanted us to encounter one of the bad guys' henchmen.  We spent the day shopping, getting a curse removed, and then going to a tavern.  Guess who showed up at the tavern drunk and belligerent?  We made the decisions, and the DM made the world bend around to fit us into the plot.  

Always remember, no matter what plan you had for the plot, the players didn't know it.  Twist and bend that plotline so it shows up on the rails the players are laying, not the other way around.  They'll never be disappointed that the plot suddenly showed up in their backstory, but they might if their backstory has to wait until the plot is finished."

AskReddit,fezse1g,t3_eqzw11,1579461042.0,"If I can travel multiple times, back and forth through time, my first stop would be google.  I'd research materials that are cheap now, but would be valuable in the past.  I know for a certain time aluminum was really expensive, for example.  Second, I'd research buildings and or locations that haven't been explored in a long time.  I'd then travel to the past, and sell some of these things for local currency.  I'd use the local currency to buy things that are cheap but will appreciate greatly (collectibles, like a Superman #1 issue).  Next, I take my collectibles, and hide them in one of those places no one will visit.   Finally, I come back to the present, and pick up my collectibles for sale now.  
I say finally, but actually, my next step would be to travel to the future.  No way to really say what I'd do after that, though, since I don't know what I would find there."
AskReddit,fejn3bl,t3_epil67,1579180426.0,"Well, first is growing up to an age where I can actually do things for myself.  Lack of physical development is going to really annoy me early on.  Though losing some of the aches and pains will be nice.

Once I can talk, getting my parents to understand where I'm at intellectually will be important.  Get myself into some special programs and get a GED as early as possible, then move on to college.  In this timeline, I messed up college and was 36 before I got an Associates degree.  I'm going to a good 4 year school next time around.  Use what I already know to ace the easy courses, and take courses in the things I want to add to my knowledge base.  Computer programming is a must, though my favorite language (Python) will not exist yet if I enter college early.

After this, investing in companies I know will grow, avoiding the ones I know will fail.  And a big push right out of college to apply for startups with stock options, but only if I know they're going to succeed.  Cash out of a big startup, plus bitcoin when it's early and easy and I'll be set for life and able to take the rest however I want."
