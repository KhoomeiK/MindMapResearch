A couple days after this I was approved again and haven’t had issues since. Just keep filing the weekly claims and see how it goes."
BipolarReddit,fqa5jpd,t3_ghjdk9,1589213203.0,"I 100% relate to this. I did almost the same thing in college, and only finished my last quarter after hospitalization thanks to the goodness of my professors allowing me to take the finals weeks late, and being able to test out of a portion 6 months later. 

Not just college, but then came a child (bio dad didn’t stick around) and then finding someone I wanted to share my life with. Our marriage was beyond rocky for years. He saw the bipolar daily quickly (and wonderfully, saintfully, has stuck by my side). It wasn’t easy for him and I was hospitalized twice again in the first few years of marriage. My husband has helped me become a person who people from the outside see as “positive, motivated, energetic, a leader, and a role model...” and half the time I’m like ...wut? Me? I don’t feel like that person half the time. I also don’t share this with anyone other than a few close friends and my husband. 

In recent years, I stopped sharing this information with new friends. One who I just love shared a story of her BP (now ex)husband’s abuse to her and some very wild stories involving guns and barricading himself in the house. Her association with BP is not one I want her to associate with me—that fear that I could flip like that at any second. ....and in reality... I could. It’s the nature of the beast. I’ve watched it happen in other BP family members. It’s scary.  I’m stable now but I know sometimes meds stop working, or I somehow forget a dose even though I keep that ish in an am/pm 7 day container... and then there is that whole “do I really need these meds?” Thought that creeps in regularly....

I understand wanting someone to get it and just be a person you can share this with. It’s awful to not be able to share at that level. I think it’s out of other people’s lack of understanding, and fear of that unknown that makes them dismissive like they were to you. Maybe a time will come down the road though, when you need that friend, and they will be able to see the delicate balance you maintain and be there when you need it. Hugs to you, I’m glad you are currently doing well. Keep up the good work."
BipolarReddit,fq8uubk,t1_fq1kv2b,1589176176.0,"I’m hoping I’ll be able to get the prescription, but don’t know what my doctor is doing right now. I’ve been stable long enough to go in for check ins and refills quarterly, so I haven’t been in in almost 3 months and just need to call and figure it out.

Coming off of antipsychotics was a help for me too, I went from 4 different drugs to 2 daily now for the BP. Still not as sharp as I once was!"
BipolarReddit,fq11yct,t1_fpsqu2c,1589040681.0,"Losing access to something that helps is a scary thing—like I’m about to run out and don’t have an appt until the end of the month... and we have stay at home orders still. I don’t even know if we are meeting in person or tele yet.... and you have to have a written script. Oy.

Any thoughts on if the brain fog ever clears when people come completely off meds? (Not going to jump right to it, just really interested in the answer)."
BipolarReddit,fpsp62g,t1_fpse3hs,1588877250.0,"I’ve been medicated for BP consistently for ~8 years now, and the ones I take have dumbed me down in so many ways. I’m in a masters program now, so to combat the dullness, I started on adderall, and then armodanfil, to increase alertness and focus. I DID big time notice that when starting out I was hypomanic in less than a week, however, I started taking them one day on, one day off, then increasing as needed at a low dose until I could tolerate the drug without concerns of mania, but also to stop taking it easily. 

I’m still not as sharp as I once was, but now I can listen to a 20 minute video on the succession of Roman Emperors in the classic period without getting up to change my shoes, go to the bathroom, make a snack, look up Trevor Noah’s latest Social Distancing Show on YouTube’s and “oh—that guy played the Mario theme on guitar! Cool!”.... wait... um, et tu, Brutus? I was also able to read a book to a class of students without nodding off during the 15-20 mins I was reading outloud.... that was fvcking embarrassing..... good thing 2nd graders are forgiving little creatures!!

So... point being, if people need to treat both, there are definitely ways to do it. And the side effects of drugs like Lamotragine and Lithium can cause the lack of ability to concentrate or remember things. That just makes me think more and more BP friends are going to need this sort of pick me up.  Don’t ask me what my already addled brain will look like in 5 years. I swear they should give us all annual brain scans so they could learn something more effective than piling on the drugs ."
BipolarReddit,fpsn80a,t1_fprxo00,1588876326.0,"I had to ease into the stimulants—they started out triggering hypomania, but by just taking a couple days on, a couple days off, I am able to use them effectively now. Maybe something to try if you feel like you need them!"

It’s so frustrating to be the person following the rules. I say if they get it, they get it, but it’s making it damn near impossible for me to not be jealous and want to say fuck it and do what I want as well. *i think I can I think I can I think I can....*"
CoronavirusWA,fmxf4p2,t1_fmx4zbw,1586463825.0,"Great, so that covers the flu, which the CDC’s site estimates at ~34,000 deaths last flu season.  Currently the death count for covid-19 for the US is ~12,000... for the year... since it was discovered. I believe Fauci’s latest number was ~40,000 predicted deaths.

Seeing as we are in the first year and first wave of this new disease, with no prior information to look back on, it stands to reason that we will exceed the flu total *while* we are all staying at home. Had we all gone to work and the playground continued shaking hands and hugging through all of this.... we all know it would be a much greater number.

So in a year or so, when we have proper data to compare the two with, then and only then will we really know the answer.

CoronavirusWA,fmx2eb0,t1_fmvamek,1586457246.0,Also remember we are barely into the 4th month of the year. The yearly flu number is from 12 months. So compare to a 3rd-4th of that #. Where are we now?
CoronavirusWA,fmx26u0,t1_fmvtvxg,1586457139.0,"This is what I wonder—what makes us so different from the states hit so much harder? Are we really just pros at social distancing? Or.... are we delayed? Did we already peak on April 2 as some said?  Is our air just enough cleaner to keep our lungs out of jeopardy for more people? 

The whole thing is just so confusing to me at this point. Mainly because of the numbers on the east coast. I don’t know what to think any more...."

CoronavirusWA,flhmvd0,t3_fot212,1585165670.0,"Thoughts on visiting family: back me up here.

My husband says I’m reading too much about coronavirus. I would say I’m trying to stay informed. I 100% want to abide by the stay home order, especially since my husband is still working and I did go to the grocery store on Friday.  Last night he said he wants to go to his parents (in their 70’s) house to visit over the weekend. I was floored and said no way—I don’t want to put them in danger. I was shocked that he even thought that was a remotely good idea. It is completely the opposite of what we are called to do right now. That said, I understand wanting to see them. They are very close. 

Apart from telling him that the best way to show them he loves them is by calling them more frequently and staying away, what else would you say if it were your spouse/partner."
CoronavirusWA,flhm44w,t1_flhkvrt,1585165265.0,"I still think the numbers for confirmed cases is all kinds of wrong. They keep saying they won’t test people with symptoms, and we know that people carry it without showing any. How can this number that barely creeps up be right?  So no, I don’t think we’ve hit our peak.

Plus all those people who were out at Alki/Rattlesnake/etc. just exposed one another, so that will trickle down.

Just my thoughts. I would love to hear more though."

personalfinance,epbbycl,t3_bu2n8o,1559140536.0,"My grandpa passed away about 16 years ago and passed on his ‘87 Mitsubishi Mighty Max. My mom used it as a way for my brother to learn to save money and buy his first car for real cheap. It was in fantastic shape, my grandpa kept that little truck clean! My brother didn’t take such great care of it, moved to Korea, and when he came back and started working for a reputable company and bought something shiny and new, he offered the Mighty Max to me. It now had dents and the paint was worn, oil leaks and other issues. Fortunately, I married a mechanic! 😉 I was thrilled to get the truck, and don’t ever want to get rid of it. Someday when I have the spare cash I’d like to get it cleaned up again. Mind you, for me it’s all sentimental. My Gma and Gpa on that side are still my heroes in life and even though they’ve been gone since I was 22, I cherish their memories. Every day I hop in my beater truck (we call him The Colonel, as that was my Gpa’s Air Force rank), and I think of my awesome Grandpa and want to make him proud. So for me, with the relationship I had with him, I wouldn’t trade that truck for the world (much to my husband’s dismay! 🤣). I would just factor in sentimental value a bit before your final decision. ❤️"
