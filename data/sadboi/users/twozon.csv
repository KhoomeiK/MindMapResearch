And to quote Foster Wallace; *You'll care a lot less about what people think of you, when you realize how seldom they do.*

**#2** is a more obvious one, which you probably have heard before. If it bothers you that much, take measures to lose weight, such as diet and exercise.

Afraid to go into a gym? (well, they are all closed now anyways?) Refer to point #1. Otherwise, there are plenty of exercises you can do at home.
