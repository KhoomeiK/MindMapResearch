Folks I know describe having these magical experiences whereupon they really get with it. 'It' of course being a state of mind whereupon you let things come and go, as far as I can tell. Who knows? It's usually left ambiguous. 

I have thoughts that don't serve me. The thoughts sort of appear out of thin air. They're mine, and yet 'I' don't like them. I like to rationalize it as two parts of my mind fighting each other. It's the easiest way I can imagine putting it into words.

A negative thought appears, or a negative feeling. I can't do anything except to feel it through. Let myself experience them, and let them go. Everyone says doing this will eventually lead to them going away, and yet they never do.

I suppose it's my way of looking for an out. If I were to say that waking up anxious everyday frustrates me, that would be falsely defining me. And yet that is the best way to describe the emotions that arise.

The emotions that are mine, and yet come from seemingly nowhere.

Considering people talk about OBE experiences, I assume they're either real, some scheme for gain, or originally a joke.

Those are the only intentions I can imagine someone having with trying to share information about them.

I used to be so certain the world was a certain way, and things were fixed. But I had a psychedelic experience and it made me realize how absurd all of this is. So hey, maybe OBEs are real.

I want them to be. You know? Feeling is everything. And I don't like feeling disconnected.
Anyway, thanks for letting me share."

Psychonaut,fdbwn73,t1_fd718q0,1578263008.0,"The implication generally associated with the words 'getting high' is that it's in some way unnatural. The effects you experience aren't because of you - they're because of the drug. But that isn't exactly right. It's not wrong either. It's a matter of perspective. 

The way most drugs work is that they emulate chemical signals in the brain - they trick the brain into thinking the drug is actually one of the brain's chemicals.

This causes the brain to respond appropriately. In other words, if you normally had that amount of serotonin or dopamine released, what happens and what you experience as a result of taking the drug is how your body would have naturally responded to that specific situation / interaction of chemicals.

That much is probably obvious, and may be redundant for me to say.

One interesting thing is that often these drugs help you relax to an immense degree. My interpretation was that OP is suggesting this is really our natural state. If societal brainwashing trains us to go against our nature, the 'drug' emulates a natural concoction of chemicals which resets the brainwashing. Or can be used to further brainwash.

 It makes your beliefs more pliable. It makes you more childlike. It's a state of non-belief.

Once there, you may fully realize there is no such thing as a 'drug' per say. Chemical reactions are happening constantly. We don't call the amino acid reactions in our stomach a drug despite the fact that they are doing exactly what a drug would do - altering our body through chemical reactions.

When we take 'vitamins', we're taking drugs. We are literally consuming chemicals that alter our body chemistry. But they're not drugs. They're vitamins.

Its really scary. But then I get confused. Who says it's scary? Those were words, to describe how I feel. But who is feeling that?

Its like I can distinctly feel there is an awareness beyond the feeling and thought. 'Awareness' might just be another way of describing taking responsibility for my thoughts and feelings, that's what the rationalizing thoughts propose, so I'm not too sure. 

Maybe I really am something other than me, this so-called 'awareness', but those are just words. Rationalizations of the mind.

depression,f7vv59x,t3_dxspwn,1574027334.0,"It's OK. I'm not sure *anyone* who hasn't experienced something can truly understand it.

Thoughts are something that appear in the mind. We don't choose them, not really. They just appear.

I think people without depression assume that someone who is depressed has a single negative thought, or doubt, and chooses to react dramatically to it. After all, everyone doubts themselves sometimes. But *they* never let it get them down. 

But with depression, the reality is that the majority of the thoughts that appear are negative. It's a constant bombardment of negative thoughts. Literally. 

That's why it isn't as simple as a choice. Our brain isn't designed to change its wiring spontaneously. When the majority of thoughts are negative, your brain has slowly but surely been wired to perpetuate those negative thoughts. That's why things seem to keep getting worse until suddenly you realize that you're depressed and you feel powerless. 

For that reason it's critical to understand that recovery is a process, because you need to reverse condition yourself. 

I can't recommend meditation enough. It seems like a futile process but it helps you learn to push those negative thoughts away. They'll do your best keep you from getting better, but remember that you are NOT your thoughts. And remember that it's okay if pushing away negative thoughts doesn't make you instantly happy. Perservere with it. You'll find that when you push the negative emotion away, you feel really empty. It's a hard feeling to handle, because it almost feels worse than feeling sad. But it's a better point to be at. From there you can begin introducing positive thoughts. 

You will relapse at times. This is a psychological phenomenon that happens with every addiction. 

Do not let the guilt get you! The guilt presents really compelling feelings. You may even feel guilty for feeling guilty. It's a double bind.

But remember that you have always done your best to live in a way you can cope with. Everyone is always doing their best. And someone who is doing their best is free of guilt. If you made a mistake, it's only because you didn't know better. When a cute puppy does something wrong, we don't *really* blame it, because it didn't know better. Nobody would consciously choose to make a mistake. You are exactly like that puppy. If we don't hold that puppy to blame for its mistakes, why don't you deserve to be free of blame as well? You are just as innocent. You've always been doing your best. 

Much love. Alan Watts really helped me too, but remember that you'll only get advice that worked for other people, and you probably need to find your own way. Still, following the paths of others can help you find your own way. 

I believe in you. The universe is conspiring for your growth. Love, 434

(Edit*: I thought it's worth mentioning that even in doing my best to follow the things above, I basically failed. I really got pushed to my breaking point and I became obsessed with suicidal ideation.

I was basically ready to commit suicide but I was willing to give extreme options a go as a last attempt. I tried psychedelics because of the literature suggesting they were helpful for curing depression. They really helped me.

I'm not suggesting you do psychedelics at all. But if you ever get to the point where you don't think you can bear the pain any longer, it's worth trying extreme options. You have nothing to lose at that point. That's your safety net if all else fails. I think it's comforting to know that imo. There are a lot of people trying to figure out how to beat this thing.)"

Psychonaut,f3yog0b,t1_f3wveua,1571257091.0,"I think the problem is that giving up is surprisingly similar to the idea of accepting yourself, and we don't have a separate word for it.

Giving up is to accept your situation, to be resigned to your fate.

But giving up also has a kind of fuck it association.

If you give up, you give up on life. You stop doing what is normal and healthy for a person. You basically stop trying to exist as what you are. But I'm not suggesting to give up on being a human.

It's to give up on trying to be better than what you are.

By nature you want to try and do things. To give up on trying altogether is to give up on yourself. We don't want to give up on ourselves. We want to give up on trying to be something we're not.

There are psychological nuances that words can't explain. Ever heard 'Do as I say, not as I do'? The point of that is words can be true even if the one who preaches them doesn't follow it. The ego is confusing to itself and has limited focus, in a lot of ways you have to get lucky for everything to work out. Despite Alan's intelligence, that probably worked against him."

You might as well from here on out forget the fact you're on the spectrum. It's not that it doesn't make you 'different' from normies, but nothing about that fact is worth considering in your mind.

The fact 'Autism' was ever considered a disorder is a joke. Autism is a way of creative thinking that is present in a minority of people. Many of those with autism are high functioning. It's only a 'disorder' because it isn't 'average'. If it didn't confer an evolutionary advantage it probably would not be present in such a high percentage of the population. 

Continue therapy. Talking with others is great for keeping your sanity even if it is otherwise unproductive. I spent a great deal of time talking to no-one, not even family, and it quickly led to suicidal ideation. 

""As long as you never give up, there is always salvation"". 

Right now, the priority is likely to shift your mindset into a positive one. 

This can be done through extensive conditioning. You've probably heard it said before that your thoughts become reality. I can personally attest that this is true. 

You can try positive affirmations, or anything you enjoy that feels like it could make a positive difference. I really like the YouTube channel Rising Higher Meditations for stuff like that. 

Elisha Long is one of my favorites too. Have a lot of different sources. Sometimes one doesn't feel positive and you need to change up. 

When I was depressed, it should have been obvious to me that my negative thoughts would only ever keep resulting in my feeling bad and more negative thoughts. Somehow it never did. 

You have to change your thoughts, and then your reality will change too. 

Once you're at least in a positive mindset, you'll be more steady and ready to take on other challenges. 

That being said, as others have mentioned, it's still probably worthwhile to check out some other doctors, just to make sure you aren't in any immediate danger. 

As long as you're alive, you can always grow. The brain has incredible plasticity. The doctor who ran for president (I forget his name) was involved in an operation where they cut out half of a girl's brain hemisphere, and the rest of the brain was able to make up for it. 

I'm willing to bet it isn't brain *damage*. Its neuronal rewiring. But the paths can always change.

Alright a bit dramatic but the point is OP didn't do what he was asked and his wife ultimately had a choice. She could forgive him, or get upset. She got upset.

That's not to say OP has no blame. It's also reasonable to think if she did forgive him easily he'd just do it again. But then she should just threaten to leave him! Set the boundary, make it clear. 

There's really no point in getting angry. It just causes more negative emotions. 

I know it's not that easy, but ever since I did shrooms I've realized you really can stop yourself from getting upset and the like if you practice and work on it. 

Everyone's favorite stoic Marcus Aurelius in Meditations does a great job of pointing out you ultimately only have control over your own emotions. That's the one thing you can control to some degree. You can't control anything else.

""Throw away holiness and wisdom,
and people will be a hundred times happier.
Throw away morality and justice,
and people will do the right thing.
Throw away industry and profit,
and there won't be any thieves.

If these three aren't enough,
just stay at the center of the circle
and let all things take their course."" - Tao Te Ching, Chapter 19

If you can accept and live happily with the situation for what it is, only then do you have the power to change it. 

I spent a lot of time thinking about the negatives of society, and just brooding over how I wanted to see it change. 

Eventually I realized two things. First, the reason I thought about societal woes was because I wasnt happy with my own life, and two, I didn't have the power to change society as I was. Thinking about it more didn't change anything, it only made me continue to suffer.

Through self improvement maybe I can be the kind of individual who can overcome evil, or bring others into the light. Romantically it's a nice thought, but it's also practical.

Buddhism,ezg2eru,t3_d0wu5g,1567889855.0,"I think 'the present' comes when your mind is empty of words and you're entirely focused on what's in front of you. The very notion of 'being in the present' relies on past memories.

Someone also brought an interesting point to my attention recently, which was that words constrain your ability to think. This was in reference to a very interesting reddit user who seemed to push the boundaries of language in his explanations, and often made up words of his own. But unlike a schizophrenic, these words had meaning once you asked him to explain and I could understand his ideas enough that they gave me the impression his thought patterns were ordered, just so abstract to the normal way of thinking that they were difficult to understand.

Imagine if you weren't confined to thinking via words, which themselves have 'fixed' meanings. For example, words have to be put in a certain order for them to be logically coherent to other psople. But haven't you ever understood a concept, only finding that you couldn't seem to explain in words?

I just think there's something more there. I haven't figured it out either, just felt like sharing."

If you think it's safe and are determined to do it, worrying about their anxiety is just causing you undue suffering, and won't change what they're already feeling, nor will it change your actions. 

If you're also worried about whether it's safe, that might be a different story. 

That being said, do your best to not indulge the thoughts. They'll keep going, because you'll never arrive at a conclusion you're satisfied with. Better to empty the mind of words if possible, but even if not, don't beat yourself up over it."

GetMotivated,ez7nswb,t1_ez46t7g,1567726056.0,"No no, please don't put words in my mouth. I said anger usually reflects an undisciplined mind. You can reread my comment - it's right there.

And being chronically sad isn't conditioned? What is it then?

Our mind is a system of thought; if the thought pattern consistently returns to being sad, I'd argue it has some kind of inclination to returning to sadness. I don't know how you get into a repetitive cycle of thoughts that isn't in some way cyclical and can't be at least partially attributed to conditioning

That being said, I'm sensing a bit of hostility from you, friend. I haven't meant to offend and honestly my comments are quite neutral.

Im not sure why you want to make the distinction between a mental illness and a conditioned state.  With the exception of brain damage as a catalyst, the two are nearly synonymous (when the 'condition' is negative)

(edit*: my comment was also in reply to someone who literally said 'JUST BE HAPPY HAVE YOU TRIED IT', I'm not sure if that original comment was deleted because I can't see it anymore, but i was responding to that person specifically)."
Transhuman,ez3lflw,t1_ez0rx65,1567669821.0,"Hey, thanks for the response. I'm not even sure if I was referencing you in particular, can't recall at this point, so don't feel too bad. To your credit I'm still trying to figure out to what end compassion serves its purpose, as I'm unsure whether it can be as good a motivator for change as contempt.

Once you've realized it's up to you to change, compassion is great. But if you haven't really internalized the notion that nobody really cares what you think, that you don't have anything to prove, it's hard to to choose to move in the direction of well being just for your own sake.

Hell, even once I realized it, the insurmountable wall of effort that seemed to be placed before me was incredibly discouraging, made me seriously question whether it was worth it. Just constantly experiencing failure so I could learn even just a little bit about relaxing and really living life was impossible.

Still,if everyone was compassionate and supportive, I don't think people would be as afraid to be themselves. But human humor is pretty dark, you pretty much have to take yourself not too seriously to have fun with it. I'm not really sure human nature is too suited for it yet tbh.

I don't want to live a monks life - I enjoy the pleasures of modern life - but that's really the only example I can think of for a human society that functions with limited social 'entertainment'."

If you don't know what it means to be addicted to sadness, who are you to say such a thing? I genuinely could be making a wrong guess, but exhibiting emotion like that is usually reflective of an undisciplined mind. Being chronically sad is a conditioned state. It takes time and a genuine commitment to positive reinforcement to get over it, I think. Our brains aren't as simple as 'flicking a switch' when it comes to pattern recognition, it has to likewise be trained to not employ its defense mechanisms (such as sadness). Chasing happiness is part of the problem anyway, yeah?"

Then OP gets derogatory remarks thrown at him by some (not all - there is some well written and not overly harsh critique on here) who accuse OP of being an immature child because of how he's taking it, but they don't even say *that* as nicely as I just did.

If we entertain the thought that OP was an immature child, immature children aren't expected to respond well to such harsh words. Except OP is probably an adult. And so what we find is immature adults treating other immature adults like shit and so they never learn, and my argument is dismissed as 'he's an adult - it's his responsibility'. Obviously he has to make the decision to change his mind and perception, but otherwise that's a load of crap. We are what society raises us to be until we learn to think for ourselves.

The people hurling abuse at OP should be getting warnings just the same as OP. What a joke.

I know this is reddit so I shouldn't be surprised but I at least hope OP doesn't feel too bad after this. The critique is well justified its just emotionally brutal, and in that regard is wrong.

Honestly you shouldn't be expected to watch everything you say - that's literally counter to the intuitive state I think we're trying to pursue. You didn't say anything wrong, because it isn't your responsibility to right the misperceptions of others, only to do your best to not lead them astray. What you said is a simple and fairly good way of looking at life, and if it causes confusion in others, that's probably a good thing. I don't remember the exact source, but I think it was the Buddha who said that ""Suffering is mercy"". It might cause someone short term confusion but they have to personally resolve to change their thought patterns because noone can do it for them (You know this already but I say it for the benefit of anyone who might not).

The only other interpretation that would make sense to me is that eternalism is false because the ego dies on death, but nihilism is false because there is some kind of 'consciousness' or Karma or whatever that endures. It would have to follow that the ego is actually a manifestation of that 'one' (I only use one strictly as a placeholder for a concept that can't be named with words) enduring thing to really be able to say that there is nothing that dies nor is unchanging.

On a related note, I found out philosophers are very prone to suicide. I think that's the sign of living a happy life if you ask me.

Buddhism,ex3u4gx,t1_ex3rwgy,1565991611.0,"This is correct, this is not correct. That's the very paradox that is contrary to the middle path, right? The truth is probably somewhere in between. Even though that seems like a lame answer I assume (eck we don't like that) that because words don't precisely capture or explain the nature of things that these contradictions arise. The Tao basically says that everything that exists does so based off contradictions (my understanding), which at least as it comes to language and visual perception is seemingly 'true'.

Honestly I think 'Nihilism' or 'Eternalism' is just the result of a fixed pattern of thinking you get into, but it's not really any one thing and is only made to be one thing when you give it a name. It's not like you just decide 'I'm a nihilist!' (well maybe you do) but even doing so wouldn't immediately manifest into nihilistic patterns of thought. That takes time and conditioning.

But that's all conjecture and the thought that I could be completely wrong (paradoxically not possible according to my own logic) is severely depressing. Good luck!"
Buddhism,ex3sitj,t1_ex1g4jt,1565990709.0,"Ack, it's just that I have to vote for someone and the complete insincerity from any of the coherent candidates makes me seriously apathetic.

I think you're definitely right about the empathy in terms of understanding people's motivations and intentions, but honestly I feel guilt and shame all the time, it's mainly my feeling of guilt that I'm just a sinful bastard thats pushing me to self improve, although the very concept of being virtuous concerns me because I'm egocentric enough as is, even though 'objectively' morals don't matter and even subjectively if I didn't have guilt I think my life would be 10x more fun if nothing else.

Word vomit aside, my state of consciousness has seemingly kind of shifted back to usual since I made this post, which is at least a pattern of thinking that I'm used to, although that's not necessarily a good thing. 

Thanks for the reply, and if I could pick your brain just because I'm interested, do you personally think reaching a 'transcendent' state of mind is a thing? I have limited experience with altered states of consciousness but otherwise the only testament is the word of the Buddha, which is only more credible than a politician to the extent that he at least lived according to his assertions.

But I also feel like if I'm chasing anything other than the present moment, I'm just a fool. It's logically plausible for 'buddhahood' to either be or not be a thing, so I think only real experience would be able to answer that, but otherwise it's conjecture anyway. 

On that note, do you think the realization of transcendence manifests itself as some kind of neuronal pattern of thinking, so to speak? I'm not sure whether that's specific enough, or I might just be getting ahead of myself. 

Thanks for the reply"

That being said, I don't really understand what you mean by 'we take strong emotions as the path itself'. Through my observation it seems to me that my mind is essentially capable of focusing on one thing at a time. It's possible that at a higher state of consciousness, dual thought or even more is possible, but as it is my focus is seemingly limited. My preconceived notion was that the point of practice was transforming the focus from our emotions because they serve as distractions that attach us to the material/physical world and our ego. I say this because surely perception of emotion only exists in relation to past experience, which is itself separate from intuition. And (as far as I can tell) the only thing with a name that is actually directly tied to living 'in the moment' is intuition.
