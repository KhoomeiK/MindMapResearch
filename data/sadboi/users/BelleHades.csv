This infuriates me. I despise conformity and shepherding with every ounce of my being. It doesn't help that I constantly feel like the universe wants us to ""conform to it's standards -- OR ELSE!""

I try to be a free soul, to find my ilk, but I honestly think the universe has actively tried to block me every step of the way in all my lifetimes. Hell  I found out from an Akashic Records reading that the universe actually blocked my main soulmate from being born with me this life, so it is possible I might be forever alone for my whole life (I'm 35, but my age actually freaks me out because I still feel 12).

Even then I wonder if ""my people"" even exist, beyond just my SM. I am quite sexual and free love and one-track-minded, and I know I came from either Pegasus, Pluto, or both; but the extreme villification sexuality goes through in life is quite off putting.

I am already kind of considering just ending my lifetimes, but at the same time, that means my SM will be alone for the remainder of *her* lifetimes, so all I can do rn is stick it out for her; be with her as much as possible"
