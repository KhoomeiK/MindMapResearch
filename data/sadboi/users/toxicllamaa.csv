ExNoContact,fqcun7d,t1_fqcti8u,1589269511.0,I will. It also feels wrong to be seeing other people if I cannot fully give myself to them. If that makes sense.

boulder,f7blq97,t1_f7aj7wz,1573572129.0,I’m a student at CU and I don’t think exploring some cancerous tunnels it worth getting kicked out of school for so I’m gonna stay away from that.
boulder,f79yxdl,t1_f78jq44,1573517499.0,Thank you. I would not go into any mines maybe just explore the buildings or whatever is around.
boulder,f79ylbh,t1_f79vnpy,1573517336.0,"Yeah, I wasn’t planning on exploring any mining tunnels I heard about the tunnels under CU and the prohibition tunnels but I am hesitant to explore any type of tunnels because they can all be pretty dangerous."

depression,eyun4em,t1_eyul68k,1567466679.0,I definitely feel you on this one.
depression,ew0juss,t1_ew0h811,1564992487.0,Jesus that’s fucked up and I hope you know it’s not true. As a member of the lgbt community I know things can be rough especially if you’re surrounded by people who just don’t understand or are flat out assholes.
depression,evzhmtn,t1_evzhgv7,1564957853.0,Pretty cool coincidence then.
depression,evzhf92,t1_evzgtxx,1564957703.0,How’d you know GoT was my weakness? Did you look at my banner? I see you.
depression,evy7ujq,t1_evy7n29,1564925359.0,This is the main reason I can’t do it. People say they will recover and friends might but parents especially my mom will never recover and I just can’t do that to her. She doesn’t deserve it. So I stay.
depression,evy71s0,t1_evy6t38,1564924632.0,Don’t worry I don’t plan on doing anything tonight or anytime soon I’m just venting about my thoughts of what I see as the inevitable.

depression,evxvzcj,t1_evxvj3l,1564910613.0,I feel you. I wish I could remove my brain sometimes or just silence it.
actuallesbians,eu3x2qb,t3_cegzyz,1563428536.0,The struggle is so real.

actuallesbians,es1jbl5,t1_es1i54d,1561498137.0,I’m pretty sure in the second or third episode Ann literally said “ I want to make her my wife” or something along those lines. I guess they really took that marrying your best friend thing literally lmao.
EngineeringStudents,es0xki7,t1_erh7r2w,1561485006.0,I know my reply is late and I’m sorry but I just wanted to say thank you. You hit the nail on the head when it comes to exactly what I worry about. I’m glad im not alone. Knowing other people feel the same makes it seem a bit more normal. I will definitely take all this advice especially the first point and get to work.
EngineeringStudents,ergm7of,t1_ergke6l,1560846481.0,No it’s okay. I appreciate you being straight up cause then I can actually improve and not dance around the issue. I just need to chill out a bit. Im only a freshman I have time and Id rather do it right the first time and have a life outside of school. Even if it’s only a small one haha. I know what I got myself into and quitting isn’t an option I consider but I can chill out a bit it doesn’t mean I quit. I will start using online resources more and office hours for sure. Thank you again.
EngineeringStudents,erggxib,t1_ergaxlt,1560838883.0,"First, thank you. I just got off the phone with my boss and I moved my hours so now I can attend office hours and I will. I always bite off more than I can chew and it’s something I need to work on. I study a lot but I think my problem is I study hard but not smart and although things have gotten better I need to figure out what works. I really want to be an engineer and although I wish I could take 5 years due to college being expensive as hell I have to do it in four.  I think though as the semesters pass I will have caught up from high school and will hopefully get better."
