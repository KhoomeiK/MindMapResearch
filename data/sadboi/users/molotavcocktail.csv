Ive been at this for over 30 years now and I just get this hopeless feeling that I can keep going.   


The nurse at the Plastic surgeons office told me that Aetna requires 810 g \*\*per breast. I replied that I don't think that can be true since their chart shows 810 g total but I don't know what Im looking at. Maybe it is per breast. They can only take 3-400 per breast from me and that's by the dr. holding my breast in his hand and taking a swag.   


I do not have as much as some ppl have but I have a multi layer disc condition that causes me a great deal of suffering and it is exacerbated greatly by my breasts. Oh the nurse was perfectly happy to quote me their out of pocket cosmetic price which is 9500.00. I don't have this kind of money and I don't have good credit (nor a sugar daddy/ rich parents. )

Increase our asylum programs, hold the privatized mongrels to higher accountability. I can think of a bunch more but these binary ideas don't work anymore. ""Either option A or option B""   
Im sick of having binary option in political parties. Both sides of this issue need to find solutions. bleh."

They're still waiting for the one they consider legit. Their priests (whatever you call them) promote the apocalypse so that this dude will return."

Forget what you are doing, thinking etc. forget what you are doing-  smile so that when I see your face, it's pleasing to ME. If you are concentrating, smile while you are doing so- etc. etc  


I have so much to say abt this subject of working in make dominant field. GenX here working in a technical field for 25 years. I experienced it pre and Post Anita Hill so I have watched it change drastically. I don't sweat the boys club most days but I'm not 100% on that. One of my pet peeves is make engrs who when asked for information, take control or commandeer a situation out of their overwhelming hero/rescue tendencies. ALOT of men don't  but some do. Seems to be inherent in some. They automatically go into it when asked anything by a woman. and for various reasons. Some because they innocently think you want to be rescued. Some because they think you can't possibly be smart or capable enough to do what they do.  the hardest part is when you are troubleshooting a piece of equipment and they happen to be observing. Troubleshooting in and of itself is a dynamic process. you have to do trial and error and what works one time won't work the next etc. I used to get so upset because I felt all eyes watching and questioning my every decision. They still do it, it's just that I have gotten to the point that I know it's trial and error and I have watched them do it a million times.   


My 2 pet peeves- 1. men standing around one upping each other.  2. arrogant know-it-alls. Also, not a fan of double standards.  :\\"
