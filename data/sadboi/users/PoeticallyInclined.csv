Along with Fleet footwork and ravenous hunter you get a lot of healing and survivability. Runans also gives you waveclear."
askphilosophy,fgh4gct,t3_eyfk3z,1580776464.0,"This is anecdotal, but I'm a tortured artist/writer. I've been writing for over a decade, largely to deal with the mental illness that is a huge part of my daily life. I'm not sitting there mining my misery for a better poem, it's really the other way around. I write as a mode of survival. Writing helps me get through the rough times. 

Writing and art are very important to me, and are basically central to my life. However, I would give up my writing and all my aesthetic pleasures if it meant i wasn't schizophrenic anymore. Art is survival."

I'm applying for disability right now, because I'm still too unstable to work. Also I go to bed feeling like throwing up every night, but I can live with that."

exmormon,f3agnue,t3_dg8e8n,1570772476.0,"I'm a trans woman, and if you want to talk about trans things, feel free to PM me. I'm so sorry you're going through that. Try as hard as you can to go to a non church school, look for local queer meet up groups, browse r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns for some wholesome memes. I don't have any advice on what to do with your family. I left the church when I was 19 rather than go on a mission, and was semi-homeless after that--luckily my girlfriend at the time let me sleep in her dorm room with her, I had friends with couches, and there was a 24hr library at the university I went to that I could sleep in if I needed it. I don't recommend that. What you need most is a support system that will support you in being trans. Look for local organizations for LGBT youth and try to go to their events so you can make friends who will accept you for who you are."
