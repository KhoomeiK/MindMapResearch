Having depression or any other invisible condition is truly awful.. anything that relies mainly on people's deep empathy and psychology to comprehend is the worst nightmare because almost nobody will care to go that deep to understand someone if it's not plain obvious.

Most people also believe depression basically equals sadness and judge the way YOU react to it, YOU are weak.. believing THEY are better, are often sad and get over it and blablabla.. THEY know what you should do, but YOU are lazy and won't help yourself. You are not allowed compassion because you sit on your ass and do nothing while some people have it worst and work their asses off to help themselves, therefore you must be toxic waste. Most people have the EQ of a chimpanzee and only care for social norms. 

Cancer = not your fault, so sad, oh god have mercy on this poor soul.
Depression = you're weak, your fault, you should be ashamed.

But wait, if it's Lady Gaga.. they will soooooo relate and feel for her."

I tend to be very cynical and hide my emotions in life.. I've been told to shut up when I was sad or I'd get hit, so yeah, I sadly grew toxic. I never was a jealous person because of a strong character and self esteem, but the last few years I've entered a deep depression and all the sanity I've been able to maintain 'til now crumbled and made me feel jealousy, which is understandable since depression makes me look and act like an unlovable monster.. nonetheless I still believe my jealousy is only triggered by partners that don't fit me or respect me enough.

Why you seem to want him so much to be FJ I don't know, but even myself am almost 50/50 in the ""thinking vs feeling"" department. What he told me is that he tests INFJ when he's feeling sad like when we argue or when he feels alone. 

I'm open to your pov, since i'm so clueless about my SO most of the time, but I can assure you that everything about him yells TJ... from his cold robotic look to his clothes, his hobbies, interests and his career.

So what you're saying is that he's indeed not empathetic or genuine.. why does he bother with me then? Why is he trying to convince me otherwise? Can't he just accept who he is? I don't think he has anything important enough to benefit from  this relationship to justify his lying and mimicry... I just feel like a pita in his life actually... always whining about wanting alone time and hating on his control freak and emotionally abusive mother.

He told me before he felt ""invisible"" all his life... he told me he was ""nothing""... I think I'm just there so he doesn't feel alone since his parents moved out the house, but that can't work for me, none of my needs are met. Still INFJ?"

The look on his face is just.... empty. It hurts a lot.


He ""seems"" to completely lack empathy, but learned to sympathize by ""duty"" (which is very ISTJ if you ask me) ...
