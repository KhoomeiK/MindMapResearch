2. There are multiple types of bipolar (I,II,Mixed, Cyclothymia, and unspecified). Each is unique from one another but share some similarities.
3. Bipolar is different for every individual. I literally don't know of a single soul who has perfectly even cycles. I went 3 years from depressed, mixed, and manic without any normal times in between, then when 7 years with only one euphoric episode and some minor hypomanic and depressive ones, to having a debilitating mixed one this year that lasted several months with rapid cycling. I've been on the same medication for 8 years. 
4. There are different levels of mania: hypo (lack of need for sleep, being very productive, increase in energy, higher self esteem, more outgoing, racing thoughts, can't focus, and increase in talking); Full blown (that hypo symptoms and put them on steroids but rather than less sleep add no sleep, no appetite (I mean eating less than 300 calories a day), fast irrational speaking, and dangerous impulsivity that is different than normal (more sex, drinking, spending money, drugs, stealing, etc.).  Mixed are the lovely combination of the manic symptoms (increased energy, insomnia, racing thoughts) combined with depressive ones, including suicidal thoughts. Mixed are very, very dangerous. Both mixed and mania can lead to psychosis. Cyclothymia doesn't experience very high highs or very low lows, because of this its hard to diagnose because it is barely different than normal mood fluctuations. 
5. Medication literally saved my life, but it's a bitch and a half to find the right ones. Meditation works for some, but if you are in throws of mania, it ain't gonna do shit. CBT can help but it takes a lot of practice and energy . Cutting out alcohol, caffeine, and sugar is beneficial, but very difficult. 

Hear are my final thoughts. Depressive states aren't just ""feeling down"" but drains you of your energy, makes you very irritable, and can cause issues with relationships and at work. Mania isn't just ""feeling happy and great"" its having a burst of energy and creativity, being much more outgoing, and the lack of need to eat or sleep. Unless this is greatly disrupting your life, threatening your job ability, ending relationships, making you suicidal, or causing you to just in general ruin your life (drinking, gambling, risky sex) you're fine. If your moods are causing you strife, go seen a doctor, self diagnosing is dangerous and delegitimizes what people with the disorder have."

BipolarReddit,f4ja862,t3_dkpkf6,1571615771.0,"I was just diagnosed with BED (binge eating disorder). I would plan my binges out, or suddenly go to the store to buy things for a binge, and eat until I felt ill (no purging). If I wanted to binge but wouldn't let myself, it would cause a ton of stress and I'd either end up binging anyways or in the next couple of days. When I was unable to focus and was bored it triggered me(still does but meds and not having a mixed episode helps). I could gain about 20 pounds in a couple months then lose it relatively in the same amount of time with eating better foods, having a calorie deficit, and not binging after the urges ended. 

BED has only been formally recognized by the NIMH since 2017. The only FDA approved medication to treat it is vyvanse, but honestly any ADHD meds work. After I got put back on adderall it was 18X better because I could focus and not be bored. 

This article talks about the higher connection with eating disorders ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15935230](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15935230)) Most common eating disorders for teens with bipolar are either bulimia and anorexia; while adults have problems with binging."

bipolar,f4cr5mr,t3_dk487z,1571532812.0,"Diagnosed at 16, now 25; as for your question, my mental health has been better as I've gotten older. I had bouts of hypomania and depression but not nearly as awful and often as when I was a teen. I had one euphoric episode when I turned 21 for a couple of months. I did just have a really bad mixed episode, but it was made 18X worse by being put on medications that were not appropriate, having a ton of things out of my control go wrong (i.e. not getting chosen for internships/jobs, having two of my psychiatrists fired, etc.) and absolutely hating where I lived. I got out of the funk by moving to the same city where my parents retired and I'm a lot happier.

Here's my advice; make sure you're happy with at least two aspects of your life. Either that be social, family, work, hobbies, or where you live; if you at least have a couple of things that bring you happiness when shit gets rough you have something to fall back on. Additionally make sure you have a good support system, at least medically, and get to them as soon as you start feeling off. Also try to manage stress ( I know its stupid advice). I find for myself the more stressed I am, or unhappy with things I can't change, it triggers my depression or mania."

First off, good job not taking your anger out on others, or self medicating with alcohol and drugs. It takes a lot of strength to do that when you feel like crap. 

Secondly, look into mixed episodes ( where you having symptoms of both mania and depression). The social isolation, lack of motivation, and the inability to find enjoyment in things you love are signs of depression. The anger and seeing stuff could be signs of mania. If you having racing thoughts, start speaking quickly, or start uncontrolledly crying this strengthens the probability of a mixed episode. 

I went through almost the exact thing you're going through last February. I could function at base levels but seamed okay on the outside. I socially isolated myself, half assed my school work, and couldn't read or do things I normally liked to do. All I could do was lie in bed and watch youtube. The morse stressed I became the worse I felt and couldn't bounce back. Of course, my inability to do anything made things worse, as did a bunch of negative outside factors ( some cause by me not able to function, others cause by shitty luck). Eventually it got so bad I couldn't do work and then started sobbing for hours without stopping for no reason. I had to take incompletes in two of my classes, ended up not returning to school (still don't know if I'm going to go back), and moving closer to my parents. 

All in all, the episode lasted for six months and I'm still recovering.

Here's my advice:

1. Talk to your doctor about mixed episodes. There is a medications FDA approved for specifically for treating them (Valvasyr? I spelled it wrong but just google it). 
2. Take different paths to classes when you go. Getting out of your regular routine might help.
3. People are very self involved in their own lives, give them the benefit of the doubt. Your friends want to be your friends, people just are pretty much up their own asshole. 
4. Talk to S and M. Say that you're goin through some shit (you can explain it in detail or keep it vague) and haven't been yourself and need some support. It'll be hard, but worth it. 
5. If you register your disability with the school, they can help you make up a plan on how to manage your studies. Or, you could talk to professors and/or your advisor to make a plan. 
6. Don't be mad at yourself. It's the hardest thing to do, but guilt isn't going to help you. Shit happens. Life is bumpy. Take your meds, talk to your doctor, know that this feeling won't last forever. Stay strong, you got this."

bipolar,f2ugw9f,t3_de77ko,1570416231.0,"I know you're in pain but the reality is you get help now or its going to get worse. No one can function like that and no one deserves to be miserable. It takes a lot strength and determination to charter a fraternity, to fight the sadness and chaos going one, but I believe you have the courage to get help. You deserve to be healthy and happy, whether or not you parents support you to get better. 

Don't think of mental disorders as something that is bad about you and its your fault, BECAUSE ITS NOT. Would you tell someone with lupus that its all in their head and that they shouldn't take meds because they'll become dependent? No you wouldn't, because they were born with the disorder as were you with bipolar. You're 19, your parents can't stop you from going to a first psychiatrist appointment and won't know until they are billed. If they remove you from their plan universities have insurance plans for students, you can sign up right away because a change in insurance status. *If it gets so bad that you feel unsafe, please go to an emergency room.* 

If you need a group of people to talk to who are going through the same thing, here's a link [https://www.supportgroupscentral.com/clt\_addtllinks\_meetings.cfm?cid=18&rno=31](https://www.supportgroupscentral.com/clt_addtllinks_meetings.cfm?cid=18&rno=31). Its free unless you want to donate. You might get better advice there and get help figuring how to tackle everything. 

Your life is important. You are important. You have value. You are loved. You are strong. There is nothing wrong or bad about you and this isn't your fault. Most importantly, you deserve to be happy. I'm 100% projecting on to you . because your situation was similar to a friend of mine, but when you decide what to do please post a follow up so I know you're alright."
nancydrew,f2tg4rz,t1_f2srpwk,1570394495.0,"I am a younger millennial, borderline Gen Z, but no worries its hard to read social cues on the internet and I'm sure I came across as a jerk as well. I'm very much informed on the complexities of it all because I'm studying information seeking practices in grad school (and writing my thesis on it) so I get a tad bit excited to talk about it Also, count yourself lucky you have a surrounding of informed peers, because I can tell you the majority of people I know outside of academic things get their news from memes or headlines. 

You don't have to read this but cause this is just a total nerd out on my part, but in a 2018 Pew research poll over a third of people under 30 get their information through social media, but are more likely to go to multiple sources. In academic studies, the action of furthering information seeking or going to dissonant sources depends on social/political ideology and education level. Google also learns peoples personal search habits and will tailor results to wherever the user has clicked on in the past (for you its going to be the Times or the Post) and studies show that the majority of people don't look past the first page (same thing for Etsy too). 

I don't mean to sound condescending, but keep up researching and using legitimate resources. I used to work with middle schoolers and high schoolers in museum education and always asked where they got their news from (it was relevant to the discussion) I'd say vast majority would say twitter (not all of course, but a disheartening amount). Granted older adults I spoke to got the majority of news from TV (which studies back that up). 

TL;DR No worries, pretty sure I was a jerk too, but yeah, you're awesome for going to legit news sources and not twitter like a third of people under 30. 

P.S. Look up google crawlers/spiders, its freaking awesome."

nancydrew,f2pgrqk,t1_f2oo3y7,1570342974.0,"Genuine question, people still use tumblr?   


Does any of the target audience for the show have access to WAPO or the Times? Cause I can sure as hell tell you most younger millennials and Gen Z aren't paying for a subscription to be able to read those articles. If anything, they'll get their information on twitter or Buzzfeed.  And from looking at those sources, its overwhelmingly positive."
nancydrew,f2mob95,t3_ddizsr,1570307222.0,"It's got a 71% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes ([https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/nancy\_drew/s01](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/nancy_drew/s01)), and most of the reviews seem pretty positive. I don't think that this show is for hardcore fans but, for teens and twenty somethings that grew up and out of reading the books. I'm pretty excited for this show. I love the Sabrina remake on Netflix, and don't mind Riverdale. If you read the comments on the show's FB posts I'd say the vast majority is positive. I honestly don't think once this show premiers that it's going to leaving the screen anytime soon."
