CHARLIE SL

Mission design was brilliant. Defence into offence was a great idea. However, ironsights made ground infantry engaging targets less than fun. There are some ironsights that would've been better, but definitely not the FAL.

Next time, do not spawn all OBJs with entities. Spawn the first two OBJs with enemies, then move onto the next when the first one is cleared. This would avoid the powerpoint clusterfuck.

Thanks to Mosku for FTL'ing the Red Team (aka Charlie's Angels), and Bombus + Alca for medic'ing throughout the entire Op. Squadmates, thanks for keeping your composure despite all adversaries and your sharpshooting too. See y'all next time when we meet again."

A poudjik-styled mission, which tested the whole PLT's ability to the max. 

Had some great times, and low times. Fun times pew pewing, less fun times when you realised the gun sight on the M113 was not accurate and you had to aim lower to compensate for it shooting high.

Nonetheless, I would like to thank the entire BULL element for making it a fun Op to play through. FAL, thanks for driving me around with high efficiency and the marvelous callouts.

JACKAL 2

First off, my sincerest apology for fucking over the entire PLT when I crashed the C-130 into the mountains. It was my fault for not doing proper pre-flight checks before take off. Mistake no.1.

After takeoff, the C-130 were constantly rolling to the left, and for a lot too. Nonetheless, the infantry were dropped off, but they were presumably too far off to the west in the circle.

Switching to the jet, crashed again. Respawned at base, hopped into a jet and everything exploded in front of me. Classic Arma3.

Then came the real issue. The newly-spawned in ALCAs had LR radio that were incompatible with the ground net, but surprisingly, it was only me whose LR radio was fucked up. JACKAL 1 (Supabop)'s LR radio was working perfectly fine. This really clipped my ability to conduct any useful aerial support as I was completely cutoff from the ground troops. However, with Supa's suggestion of SR radio-hopping, I was able to regain contact with FAC and CO to notify them of the situation, as well as getting hold of BRAVO and ALPHA for some gun-runs/bomb-runs/rocket-runs.

Near to the end of the mission, I believe I dropped a bomb on BRAVO's position when I mistook the black smoke as a designated target that I was meant to destroy. I believe I owe you (BRAVO) an apology. Mistake no.2.

Before I move onto personal opinions, I would like to thank RED and Shanikan for accommodating a useless pilot and being ever so patient with JACKAL 2; Supa for all the aerial technical guidance and patience when flying with me, as well as guiding me on getting back in contact with ground net; Embro for accommodating me on their squadron net so that I may not feel so empty and useless. I cannot ask for any better leaders.

Personally, I loved the mission, but due to the pathetic, horrifying performance from my end and the LR technical issue, I delivered a prime example of an aerial support failure and definitely let the PLT as well as my wingman down. I'll train harder next time, and perhaps, redeem myself from this laughing stock of a performance."

The mission was...okay? As a grunt that got sent all around the map doing dismount and mount constantly, it just felt like a simulator of hop-on and hop-off rather than a combat one. Nonetheless, each squad had their obj, and BRAVO had theirs. And boy did we accomplish it.

Loved my blue team, they truly were amazing and fun to be with. Didn’t get much time to interact with red team except for SonicCZ with patched me up selflessly, but as I understand it, they were brilliant too.

Now for the AI friendly-fucking incident: I didn’t receive any intel on friendly PMC meeting us out at the gates of the compound. Adding to that was an ambush beforehand that got me rather paranoid, so yes, I fired at the PMC. Rather them dead than us dead, right?
