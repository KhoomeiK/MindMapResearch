Also, warm currents have bleached most of the coral reef there, which was very sad to see. 

The most pristine nature I saw was in the coastal mountains near Santa Marta. It’s a sky island of incredible biodiversity. But even there in the depths of the forest, the indigenous people have smartphones and eat potato chips. What a crazy world we are living in."

running,f7q6ka5,t3_dxf3yh,1573959505.0,"I ran 400m in 1:27! I know that’s really slow for a 26 year old male, but it’s still my fastest time so far :)"
AskDocs,f7n48yg,t1_f7n05w0,1573883683.0,Thanks. I’m pretty sure the salivation is mostly psychosomatic...and I’m leaning toward thinking it’s extremely unlikely I have rabies now since I’m feeling better than I was yesterday. But if I feel any worse on Monday then I think I’ll call the test clinic.
AskDocs,f7n2kjt,t1_f7n0iur,1573881853.0,"Oh the blood test I had a low ESR, which apparently is an indication that I don’t have inflammation throughout my body like I would if I had rabies...so that seems like a good sign!"
AskDocs,f7mr4z0,t3_dx04jo,1573871246.0,I’m just scared about the salivation which seems to be increasing 😓
AskDocs,f7mqsug,t1_f7mozn7,1573870961.0,"For sure. I usually see my therapist once a week, but what with the traveling I have now only seen him once in the past two months. I think not being able to talk to him combined with the stress of traveling alone has really gotten to me. (Also i don’t usually take any meds.)"
AskDocs,f7moqr9,t1_f7mn7bv,1573869244.0,"Ok, so it doesn’t sound plausibly like rabies then? I’ve been taking anti anxiety meds the past couple days to cope."
running,f7me1iu,t3_dw0zh5,1573860792.0,"Today I went on my longest run so far, recorded with Strava. 6.38 miles, at an 8:40 pace. Feeling super happy about that, especially since I’ve been very anxious about my health lately. The right side of my chest hurt a lot halfway through, but I slowed down and by the end I was able to run the sixth mile in 8:16!"
Anxiety,f7jida6,t1_f7jh6tq,1573778256.0,"Thanks :) 

Haha same! I don’t know why my body thinks it’s a good idea to act out one of my biggest fears...like how is that remotely helpful to me??"
Anxiety,f7jfd23,t1_f7jeu48,1573776432.0,"I did do a blood test today. Now I just have to wait a few days, which is the hard part, dealing with that uncertainty :/ 

It’s amazing how much the mind can affect the body. That’s what I’m hoping is going on!"
running,f7gs3ny,t1_f7g7zlj,1573714927.0,"Thanks for your reply! I went running today and noticed that the shoes are starting to feel decidedly un-springy, so maybe that’s a sign that I should get a new pair."
BPD,f77503u,t3_droc7d,1573444141.0,DAE occasionally get bouts of hypochondria where they worry they’re gonna die soon and there’s nothing they can do about it?

whatisthisthing,f6tm8ln,t3_dt1qz6,1573151024.0,Although it was in the general area of  Houston.
depression,f48ttmu,t1_f45brvc,1571448715.0,"Thank you :) 
It’s really nice because I feel like I have the chance to learn and grow in a faster time than normal and with less consequences.
Everywhere I go, I feel like a slightly different person and can feel the different potential of that place."
depression,f44xe2x,t3_cml6ni,1571361003.0,"I’ve been solo traveling for a few weeks and each place I’ve gone, I’ve had very hard times and also good times, like tiny microcosms of life itself. But by this point I just feel down...like I can’t enjoy it anymore. I feel lonely in a new city where I don’t know anyone but I have little will to go talk to people tonight. I just want to talk to someone about what’s on my mind but even back home I don’t have a great support network. I wish I were the kind of person who inspires enthusiasm, curiosity, or endearment in others. But...I’m not."
confession,f3vxmyh,t3_dih112,1571187168.0,I realize I might be worrying over something fairly small? I have pretty bad anxiety and traveling alone is making me more aware of it.
