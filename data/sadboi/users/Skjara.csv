 Sadly, sometimes your team won't listen even if you ping and type ""enemy doing herald"" or w/e and they'll just ignore it."

I think as others here said, your friend would really appreciate it and after all, the friend would be alone, but your family wouldn't. And the regret would feel worse than being mocked by family members in my opinion."

On the other hand, I've won many botlanes and still we lost because of poor macro etc. And who says supp isn't important, he's dumb himself, because support is the one who can watch the minimap, see, where the enemies are, prevent ganks etc."
