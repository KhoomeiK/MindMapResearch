relationship_advice,fr3q6hb,t3_gmfy0z,1589863311.0,"This happened to me once. My friend from our hometown, on a weekend he was there, told me he was on it, along with a few screenshot, including a bio that was 100% written by him. When I confronted him, he said he was just curious about the platform, would have never cheated, etc.

I decided to believe him and stayed.

He left me about two months later. We’d been together for 6 years. 

He is looking at other options to get out and doesn’t care about your feelings. Leave this guy, you deserve better."
relationship_advice,fqyluz6,t3_glladc,1589750703.0,"It sounds to me like he thinks he gets to control your appearance and that you should dress to please him. Which isn’t the case. He also sounds like he has no issues hurting your feelings, and likes to make comments to make you feel insecure.

The trash took itself out, don’t bring the trash back in your house."
relationship_advice,fqxj9f3,t3_gl81l2,1589733156.0,"A lot of people have mentioned how it is cheating - and it is, I agree, but, just to bring some nuance here... I've known I was bi for years (like, more than half of my life). If I was in a relationship and questioning my sexuality, and had ONE kiss at a party, I guess I don't think it's the end of the world? Now, knowing full well you're bi and kissing someone at a party isn't the same thing. I guess I can kind of understand her weird logic, in a way. I've kissed a girl at a party in a drinking game while I was with my ex, long after my coming out, and told my ex the next day, for full disclosure. I would have never kissed her had it not been for the game. He was also feeling weird about this, just like you are, but understood it was just because of the game, and let it go. We never really saw it as cheating.

But I do understand your feelings, and they are completely valid. Can you move past this? Can you two come to a common understanding of what is/isn't cheating? As I said, it really is only a kiss at a party, unless it's something else. If you want to stay with her, you need to be clear that it happened once and I guess that's understandable, but it can't happen again, no matter what her views on cheating are."

It will make him feel welcome to your home, and that you're taking part in actually building his life with your family, and that he's part of it. Also, if you do Netflix nights, ask him what series he wants to watch, and watch it together. Same goes for dinners - ask him what his favorite meals are and do it once every other week.

relationship_advice,fpvu7hk,t3_gfrak3,1588951916.0,"Don't be mad at your wife for thinking it through. This is a long-time friend, she doesn't want to burn a bridge (friendship wise I mean) and needs some time to process the information, make a game plan on how to talk to him in the future, etc. It doesn't necessarily means she wants to shag him, or end things with you, at all. Also, your relationship with him might be done, but you don't get to control her relationship with him at all. If she wants to remain friends, let her. 

This happened to one of my best friends. Her boyfriend ended up leaving her because she was confused about her BFF's declaration and needed some time to process things, which is perfectly valid. Being love bombed is a LOT to take in, especially from a best friend. So, anyway, the boyfriend left, and she never ended up with either of them."

Sincerely, you will never see your kid ever again if you do this. Because he will blame you both. You can stop this. This is insane.

My parents had warned me from a young age that if I wasn’t studying and living under their roof after I turned 18, I would have to pay to stay there. But they would have never kicked me out. On the contrary. I’m 28, and when I was 26-27, I was thinking of moving back to my hometown for a job offer. My parents immediately offered to house me and all my belongings/furniture to make sure I didn’t jump on an apartment that would be out of my budget or inadequate because the market was terrible. For free. They refused to let me pay an amount to stay there and contribute for groceries and bills. I never actually moved because I ended up declining the job, but this is what parents do. Nurture. Help. Not let kids learn the hard way how life can be tough."

relationship_advice,fmcdkfz,t3_fubn0u,1585943615.0,"My ex-boyfriend did the same thing to me on a much smaller scale.

He was literally just throwing it out there to be mean and to drag me and my self esteem down because he was jealous of other things.

So, sorry to be blunt, but your boyfriend is a manipulator, and this is 100% emotional abuse.

> He told me I’m average and he wants me to stand out. That he noticed I have low self esteem and he is trying to make me confident and be happy with myself. 

Exactly. He noticed you have self-esteem, but he doesn't want to make you ""better"", he wants to keep dragging you down because he knows you have self-esteem issues. He is NOT helping.

Dump this idiot. You don't deserve to be put through this. No one does. And anyone who thinks someone who's 5'4 and 125lbs needs to go on a workout plan and diet is an idiot. Even if you did need to eat better and get in shape for health issues, it needs to come from YOU. No one can force you to do this. And at the weight you described here, trust me, you're fine. And you will eventually find someone.

I suggest seeking therapy to work on those self-esteem issues, but for goodness sake, dump this tool already. And he can't make you not dump him unless you cave in. Don't cave in. Say this is it, I can't, you're dragging me down and I won't do this anymore, bye. Block him."

relationships,fif7vlf,t1_fidp9vf,1582386624.0,"I disagree with his choice of words, but he’s right - a lot of international degrees aren’t recognized here in fields like medecine, engineering, etc. I live in Quebec and we need more doctors, but the government doesn’t recognize a lot of international degrees and I think they have to take additional classes or something, but in some cases they’d have to start all over again. I don’t know too much about it since it doesn’t really apply to my field (I’m in communications) but it’s a messed up. There’s ton of stories of immigrants who had careers (lawyers, doctor, you name it) who can’t work in their field here and become taxi drivers etc. 

I don’t think there’s a reason to call us fake British fucks but I understand that this is a very frustrating situation for immigrants. I can’t imagine."

TaylorSwift,fh746n2,t3_f1hbcx,1581314503.0,"This is the song that helped me the most through a break up. And when I moved out of the apartment we shared 18 months after the break up, when I put all my songs on shuffle to unbox my stuff in my new apartment, the very first song that played was this one. It will always mean so much to me."
popheads,fh2woq9,t1_fh1wf8m,1581261907.0,I discovered My Boy back in 2017 and showed to all my girlfriends because the lyrics “my boy loves his friends like I love my split ends” made me HOWL.
popheads,fh2w9sj,t1_fh22s08,1581261761.0,"Same here! First time I heard Wicked Games it was during a radio show in Ottawa when they put one new song against another and listeners get to vote on the song that gets put into the rotation. Wicked Games didn’t make it and I was astounded because I thought it sounded brilliant.

They spinned the shit out of it after and The Weeknd became THE WEEKND but that story will always make me laugh."

You say that he may get back together with you... Why would you WANT to get back together with him?! He doesn’t care about the rough patch you’re going through. He’s using you financially. He’s been flirting with your roommate in front of your nose. Now he’s dating her as a trial run and if he doesn’t like it he can get back together with you? What in the world?! 

Pack your stuff and my god, leave. They made their bed, now they can lie in it. Either go back home or find another apartment. If you stay in London, you’ll make friends and be fine. Do. Not. Take. Him. Back."
