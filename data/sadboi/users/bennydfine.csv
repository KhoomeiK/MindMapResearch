AskReddit,f8xgrda,t3_e2nive,1574918294.0,"Just don’t feel in tune enough with myself to be around family I guess. And it sound pretty selfish, but having a judgmental family you’d understand. Don’t want to ruin anyone’s vibe or put on a fake smile knowing everything isn’t okay. Even though I’ll say it is. Surprisingly, this is actually my first year spending thanksgiving alone.. hopefully my last."

depression,ewunx6g,t3_cq59vv,1565787202.0,"Yep. I’ve been in a relationship for 22 months now and feel as if the girl I’m with, really don’t want to be with me. My trio in high school is now a duo. And I’m not included in that duo. It’s like they’ve changed. Or maybe I changed"
depression,ewsfwhd,t3_cml6ni,1565726748.0,"I’m honestly just looking for help. Someone I could talk to and confide into without being judged..I’ve been stressing this whole week, and just don’t have any hope or motivation on things getting any better. I’ve thought about taking my own life in the past, and now those feelings are reoccurring. Feels like I’m always getting the short end of the stick. My family advises me to pray, but I just feel I’m spiritually lost as well. What do I do?"
