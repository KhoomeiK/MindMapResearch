Just try taking things slow, don't mind other people who think about you because they don't really know who are what your potentials are, which makes their judgements irrelevant and most likely created by their inner insecurities, so they'll just attack other people to make them feel less worried about their insecurities. Its ok to have no friends than to have fake friends, it would actually benefit in your situation like no peer pressure and you won't be feeling like you have to do that or do this just for them which is really stressful idk. Just don't over think really that much and try doing your own things you like to do. Maybe try focusing on yourself to be a better version of yourself and just by being yourself could actually attract friends that is true and what's compatible for you."
