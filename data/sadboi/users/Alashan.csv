I was addicted to prescribed Adderall, pain pills when I could get my hands on them, but my favorite was drinking heavily every day. My life was a rollercoaster, no anti-depressant or any psychiatrist/counselor could help me when I was in active addiction because I was not truly ready to help myself. My lows were crippling and my highs were destructive.

Even when I got clean/sober it took months of a rollercoaster but finally after being able to finally experience my true self/feelings. Actually be able to communicate effectively with my psychiatrist about my meds and situation. Actually had the ability to be a contributing member to my family and society as far as working a career and helping other people. Then my life started to stabilize significantly. Sure there are ups and downs man, but they are totally manageable compared to my life before.

I got Sober/Clean through Alcoholics Anonymous personally, took months of relapsing for me to finally get it but creating sober friends and a network of people that supported and wanted to help and then also giving me the chance to help my fellow addict/alcoholic helped me stop drinking and using.

Please look into a rehab or Narcotics Anonymous. Please have a open mind. Your chance of finding a better mental health, balance, and stability will start with a journey to want to put down the recreational drug use and to start effectively and truthfully communicating with your doctors. 

Best of luck."

For someone who is just a Alcoholic, he getting more benefit from the meetings over 1 on 1 therapy might be absolutely true, this is his personal experience and story, its a very valid point.

Also there is the context that many alcoholics and addicts have experience with that rehabs and substance abuse counselors were just a waste of money for them, they relapsed right when they left the institutions.  But AA/NA was what really worked with them, working with fellow people in recovery.  Its a valid story and experience for many people in the rooms. 

But for me I need AA to help me stop drinking, a psychiatrist for medication management to stabilize my highs and lows, and a counselor to discuss my depression and mental health issues that I do not feel comfortable discussing with my sponsor, its outside of my alcoholism and addictions.

I don't see any need to get upset with it, we cannot control other people, How It Works explains this thoroughly.  Some people will just not understand the aspect of mental illness, thats ok, AA is not designed to support mental illness, it literally has a singleness of purpose.

But if people in AA put down those that seek Mental Health professionals, they obviously have not read or follow the big book.  A part of the Big Book that is huge for me and my condition is page 133 in the chapter The Family Afterward.

""But this does not mean that we disregard human health measures. God has abundantly supplied this world with fine doctors, psychologists, and practitioners of various kinds. Do not hesitate to take your health problems to such persons. Most of them give freely of themselves, that their fellows may enjoy sound minds and bodies.

Sure I was driven to cope by my highs and lows but I experience the “phenomenon of craving” when I start drinking or using, once I start I don’t want to stop. I am a alcoholic/addict through and through, my bipolar is just another layer of complication I have had to work through in life and reinforces my need to stay sober.

My focus in meetings is to get in good recovery and to help another alcoholic/addict, I don’t want to single myself out from the rest of the meeting with a label other than alcoholic.

Bipolar has a high risk for alcoholism and substance abuse. My therapist and psychiatrist both told me I was drinking so much #1 because I was a alcoholic and secondly because alcohol was my mood stabilizer (a shitty one).

For about 4 months I was put on antidepressants for severe depression but the sick person I was I didn’t discuss my drinking with my psych. I entered another layer of hell drinking heavy on anti depressants and sleeping meds. Started to experience serious mixed episodes.

I finally had to get sober because I was hitting a life bottom. And my mental health got worse for several months, I didn’t have my medicine (alcohol). Luckily my psych and therapist were able to identify my mixed episodes and get me on a mood stabilizer and the BP2 diagnosis.

My advice is to be careful with drinking and bipolar disorder and especially with the meds we take. 10 months sober and my life has been so stable with the right meds and no more alcohol.

Drank very heavily with it and it was like magic for me to keep going the next day and I would experience serious cravings for alcohol while on it. I made a lot of money during these years (commission job) and created a lot of wreckage as well. I eventually had to stop because of all the weight I lost and kept drinking for another 1.5 years heavily and fell into a very deep depression that led to my bottom.

I personally know I could never go back to any type of stimulant, even without drinking. But this is my personal experience and knowing my disease of more.  I have friends in the rooms that are prescribed it for work/school and remain sober from alcohol no problem, that is between them and their doctor.

My advice would be to be truthful with your doctor about your recovery and to first try non-stim related medications first.

My Strength, Hope, and Experience: 

Quitting drinking was the hardest thing I ever did in my life, I smoked Marijuana before coming to AA once in a blue moon but 100% Alcohol is my drug of choice.  During my first 3.5 months of sobriety I actually smoked Marijuana a few times when I got very depressed and close to a drink to avoid drinking.  I knew it was wrong, but I was just so scared to drink because my bottom was very emotionally painful from drinking. I tried to rationalize the cigarette smokers too just like most MJ smokers in AA try to.  

One night I was really close to a drink, smoked with a friend, and on the drive home I realized I was really high/impaired to be driving and it brought back a lot of emotions/memories of always driving drunk (what was the difference?).  I got home and immediately called my sponsor, admitted my MJ use and we had a constructive conversation about being able to handle life on lifes terms completely sober. He had me pick up a white chip the next day, forfeiting my 3.5 months, which again was the hardest thing ive ever done.

I was so angry and resentful about it for weeks, 3 months to a newcomer is huge, especially for not even drinking.  But it ended up being a huge turning point for me in AA and sobriety.  Knowing I now could not fall back on the MJ as a crutch I really began to work the program hard, called my friends in the program and sponsor daily, never missed a meeting, and my sponsor pushed me hard through the steps.  Being mad about those 3 months was just my ego, length of time does not matter, only today is what really matters.  I now have 5 months, work 10,11,12 every day, have a sponsee, and have many service commitments within my home group. AA is a huge enjoyment of my life, because of all the friendships I have made and my true enjoyment of helping others.

It ended up being a blessing in disguise. I became more willing to learn from the big book and build a relationship with my higher power. Hell I even pushed through my steps with a new sponsor. You can learn from this experience and push through, we can’t all get it right the first time."
alcoholicsanonymous,f6uvm9g,t3_dt3z2d,1573169801.0,"You work your program man and I’m happy for you that you are clean from drink and a hard drug, I totally get it as a fellow alcoholic and substance abuser. But personally I told on myself to my sponsor and white chipped myself after 4 months for smoking weed, but I personally knew I was just reaching for ease and comfort and to escape my problems, no other legitimate use. 

But my best friend in the program is 27 and has damn cirrhosis of the liver and a surgical tube coming out of his stomach that he has to drain daily. He never quit pot after he stopped drinking but that doesn’t stop me from being so proud of him for being 7 months without a drink and working his program. The pot is between him, his sponsor, and higher power."
alcoholicsanonymous,f6sqyt7,t3_dsur1k,1573138516.0,"When I first got sober I was so depressed and miserable. I was still isolating which made me more depressed. I started going to 2-3 meetings a day until I could start working again. Even if I had to drive 45 mins to the meeting. I ended up connecting with people who were nothing like me yet had so much in common. Keep hanging in there, keep reaching out, you got this!"
alcoholicsanonymous,f6p5shm,t3_dscvjw,1573048237.0,"Thank them for their time and commitment to your sobriety. That you look forward to staying sober with them in the rooms as friends but want to go another route with a sponsor. =] Worked for me, good luck!"
alcoholicsanonymous,f6o9mf5,t3_ds8yt8,1573011155.0,"You just need a desire to stop drinking to join AA! Hit a meeting, you will find many people in the rooms struggle with substance problems as well but probably choose to only share about their problems with alcohol. Each group is different but you will most likely find friends and most importantly a sponsor that will help you stay sober! Good luck man, one day at a time!"
ChildrenOfBodom,f6kbmmy,t3_drq02t,1572909532.0,Wow what drama. I’m still shell shocked about the breaking up after Hexed being a really strong album even after 25+ years of making music together. RIP COB tho I am a bit excited to see what Alexi plans to do with his future band.
alcoholicsanonymous,f5oeors,t3_doit1d,1572316209.0,"One of my biggest “secrets” I chose to tell my therapist instead of my sponsor. I still wrote it out 4th step column format and had my counseling session before I met with my sponsor for the rest of the 5th step.

I have a good relationship with my sponsor just chose for this one item to not be shared with anyone in AA. Worked for me!"
alcoholicsanonymous,f5oe3h2,t3_doizv0,1572315827.0,"Being there is huge! If you don’t like sharing at meetings, maybe try talking to someone after the meeting who you identified with their share."

bipolar,f3vlk0s,t3_didn6q,1571178877.0,"Topamax works great for me! I am on Topamax and Effexor. Initially and on every increase I experience the normal side effects (brain fog and the strange taste) but they all go away for me in a few weeks. I never experienced significant weight loss but I have a healthy appetite and exercise regularly.It has helped keep me very stable and I’m happy with it. I’d say give it a try but meds work for some and not for others, it’s a very frustrating process!!"
alcoholicsanonymous,f3ng1ch,t3_dhbzxr,1570997822.0,"I personally white chipped myself after 100+ days for smoking weed once. I didn’t feel sober anymore and my sponsor helped me understand that by smoking weed for stress I was reaching for ease and comfort. How is that any different then a drink? 

I think you are looking to do AA on your own terms and I see why people do not see you are sober or wanting to truly get sober if you think you can still smoke weed and say you are 26 days. It’s awesome that you have stopped drinking but if you want true sobriety and a real change id think hard on smoking weed man."
