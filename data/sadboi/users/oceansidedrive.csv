dogs,fr6ag8r,t1_fr68yfp,1589922755.0,"No one needs a pure bred dog period. And the ""poorly bred"" dogs you find at a shelter are proving my point. They wouldn't exist if breeders didnt breed them. Mix bred dogs have a lot less health issues than pure bred and... its a dog! Regardless,  You think because you get it from a breeder you know exactly what you are getting? Its like having a test tube baby and assuming it's going to have every single trait you want just because you ""created"" it. An animal is an animal. You get what you get and if your not prepared to take care of a dog regardless of their quirks you shouldn't be getting a dog at all."
dogs,fr69sv6,t1_fr67j67,1589922427.0,"All service dogs are from organizations so I don't know how you have one without going through an organization unless you trained and got it certified yourself whereas you can still do that regardless of if its been bred. Breeders shouldn't be certifying service dogs. Super sketchy?  Organizations have their own breeding programs. 

I can absolutely be against for profit breeders but understand the importance of breeding for conservation by a legitimate organization. Breeding for the purpose of making sure an animal stays in existence is completely different from breeding just to make money. Dogs are no where near extinct. Breeders aren't necessary at this point at all."
BingeEatingDisorder,fr68j4l,t3_gmw2mg,1589921779.0,"As long as you are counting calories and obsessing about loosing weight you will probably keep binging and gaining weight or remaining the same. Binging disorder is a mental health disorder because its not about binging its about why you binge. Everytime you don't make weight, eat over your caloric amount, eat a food you were suppose to restrict you ""fail"" in your mind. Which leads to shame, guilt, sadness, and a binge. You have to figure out the reason for the binging and how to.cope.with those emotions without binging. Most ppl in recovery will tell you it began with giving up diets and stopped obsessing over weight. I have lost over 50 pounds and it only started happening because i stopped counting, weighing, measuring, and restricting. Everytime i focus on loosing weight I end up gaining it again because i binge. When i let it go, and just eat whatever. I loose weight. Those binges are detrimental to your health, physical and mental. If you can curb binges you will loose weight naturally. If you want to stop binging you need to stop obsessing about what you eat. It seems counter productive but eating an extra few hundred calories a day is still going to be less than the thousands you may have in a binge multiple times a week. It doesn't ""even"" out because your body doesn't metabolize like that. Ultimately it is healthier for us to casually eat higher caloric food everyday at a regular portion than it is to restrict our food and then binge on it. Because binging is a cycle that will keep coming back. If you can figure out how to eat without binging you'll naturally start to eat healthier because you arent relying on food to help you cope anymore.  I lost 50 pounds without a diet, eating things i still like and that others would consider ""bad"" foods. But i dont binge them because im not restricting them. That 50 pounds i lost is from stopping binging not from reducing food. Focus on the why before you figure out the how."
dogs,fr66kvd,t1_fr5x68v,1589920802.0,Completely different scenario. It is 1000% possible to have a specific breeding program for service dogs and make breeding for profit illegal. No one who is against breeders are against service programs or breeding for the purpose of conservation. That's absurd.
dogs,fr65w4g,t1_fr5xiye,1589920459.0,"Yeah i ran into that too. If you go to an organization that rescues international dogs they are more lenient as they know the dogs will die without a home and its usually time sensitive. I wanted to adopt a local dog but the shelters were very biased against me living alone in an apartment. There are tons of places rescuing from taiwan, mexico, cuba, tons of places all over the world. There is always a fit if you really want to rescue."
dogs,fr657ph,t3_gmupjz,1589920125.0,"There are lots of puppies needing adoption too. Rescues are always getting dogs from puppy mills, abusive breeders or just peoples dogs who had a liter. They go quicker though so just contact your local shelters/rescues and ask them to call you when they get puppies i used to volunteer at a shelter and puppies did come in. Usually in liters. They'd be gone within a week due to people waiting for a puppy so its very possible to adopt a puppy. 

Breeders are creating a problem that doesn't need to exist purely for profits. There will always be millions of dogs and puppies that need homes without breeders. A dog isn't a product. It makes no sense to pay thousands of dollars for a pure bred labrador when there are hundreds sitting in shelters right now. If people stop going to breeders there would be more space in peoples homes for rescue puppies and adult dogs and we could save more dogs instead of letting perfectly healthy, lovely dogs die in shelters simply due to overcrowding."

At 32 years old thinking of trying to get into university spending 4 years of my life so I can get into a career that makes more money when if I just tried a little harder I would have already had a diploma 10 years ago. It matters. If it doesnt matter now it could matter when your older and trying to get a higher education when your a grown ass adult with multiple responsibilities is incredibly difficult.

AmItheAsshole,fr23612,t1_fr1ovqr,1589830356.0,Yes cause im sure holding an elevator door open for half a second is going to result in ultimate death. There is a much higher chance of the kid doing something stupid while left alone in that building then the chance that the kid or mom have corona and are going to sneeze in his face in the 2 seconds it could have took him to just stop the door from closing. All excuses. OP wants to be that kind of person thats fine. But then dont complain if ppl think YTA because he already said she doesnt like the girl and ultimately didnt feel it was his problem. He made a decision to ignore a chance to ensure a childs well being and carry on with his day. No point in all the excuses if youve made it clear why you didnt care in the first place. Personally I would have just stopped the door regardless of my feelings toward anyone because an innocent child doesnt deserve to get lost or hurt because the moms an asshole and I would hope others would see it that way too but the worlds gone to shit so guess this is the new norm.

solotravel,fqxj75n,t3_glhrrp,1589733126.0,"It depends where your travelling really. If its a well establish backpacking country with higher end, newer hostels like australia or Iceland you'll be fine with a suitcase. If your traveling in places with older or less evolved accommodations like some places in europe or latin america or something then the backpack is probably the way to go. It also depends if your roughing it a bit more, like planning to walk and take buses everywhere or if you have the funds for cabs and private transport everywhere. 

If your travelling with just a carry on it should be fine tbh but anything bigger than that an it will prob become a pain in the ass depending where you are. I always choose a backpack because a lot of hostels wont have elevators or elevators are broken and getting up stairwells with a suitcase is a bitch. You also never know how far a bus station or whatever will be to walk to and what type of terrain youll be walking on. Backpacks you can usually keep close to you where as suitcases you may have to stow them in other places when on transport and though most hostels have huge lockers these days alot of them were built to hold backpacks not large pieces of luggage. I would analyse where youll actually be travelling to. Maybe actually post the place so people have a better idea of what youll be facing and can help more."

Everytime a character mentions another dead parent I roll my eyes its like the easiest thing for a writer to just say okay we need something for this scene lets just have another monologue when this guy reveals he also has dead parents.

Medication can help with symptoms that comes from BPD like depression,anxiety,ocd, etc. But the actual treatment for BPD is therapy more specifically DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY (DBT). DBT isnt like the therapy you see on tv. Its a skills based program which helps you sort your problematic thinking that leads to emotional distress. The program is typically done in a group setting and does often included 1 on 1 therapy with a counselor but that is in addition to the skills class just to help you keep on track. So its not really diving in the deep end into all your painful memories not unless you want it to be. PTSD is a completly different program. You need a trauma program to help with that. Unfortuently for both of these issues you need to face them or theyll never go away. Youll keep pushing it away and it will come back as a problematic behaviour.

BPD,fpxqwz7,t3_gg4gkm,1588987769.0,"Acceptance is a huge hurdle to overcome when you have bpd. Finding the positives in the diagnoses is a way for people to try to accept the diagnoses instead of fighting the reality. The ""I hate this and it shouldn't be happening"" thing is probably the hardest thought to overcome because none of us want to be dealing with what bpd gives us but the fact is, its not changing. We have the diagnoses and it is what it is. Nothing that we do short of following treatment is going to change that fact.  Fighting it or wishing it was different will only cause you more suffering and the people on here that are looking for the silver lining are headed in the right direction. They are heading towards acceptance which could lead them to recovery. If you havent already started DBT i strongly suggest you find a program and get started. These are the thoughts that keep up trapped in suffering and the exact type of thoughts DBT helps tackle. 

Just because you are in a bad place doesn't mean you should rag on those that are trying to see an alternative to loom and gloom.  At some point, you'll have to accept that acceptance is the way out of the darkness. Don't hate on people that have found their way there."

Its a lot easier to adjust to technology when your growing up with it rather than just having it introduced to you all at once without prior knowledge of how even the basics work. Most adults in this range had a computer at work and maybe a desktop at home. Office work computers werenr often updated so they could have been working with a PC running window 95 for 20 years lol. Wouldn't be uncommon. And a home desktop didnt used to get replaced often either so even if they were around for the technology improving most of them weren't trained on it as it continued to develop and older adults need to be trained on these things because its unfamiliar to them and out of their scope of knowledge.

Its nice you have empathy for those that have less than you but be grateful for what you have. You dont want to live a hard life believe me. You know what privilege does give you. It give you opportunity. It give you the opportunity to show us ""regular folk"" lol that there are good people out there that are privileged because they can get a bad wrap. So instead of being a privileged kid that just cares about possessions and superficial shit like some others. why dont you show everyone theyre wrong. Donate to charity, volunteer, you know help out.

One time she came to an event to support her cousin(the bride) . She was there maybe 20 minutes and then told us she had to leave which was kinda like wtf why did you bother even coming. About 10 minutes later we were walking around the event building and my friend stops and says. I hear my cousin singing. I was like what? She left? Shes like thats my cousin for sure. We opened a door and she is on a stage in front of an audience singing. Were like wtf how did this even happen? Supposedly someone recognized her and asked her to sing so she went out and performed for who knows how long. Clearly not needing to get anywhere in a rush.

She literally stood in front if them with arms out belting her song like she was Celine dion in vegas. During their FIRST dance. She completely tried to upstage them and it was an incredibly cringe worthy experience to watch her cousin try to make a show out of her own performance rather than letting the bride and groom have the attention.

Dogtraining,fphqpq9,t3_gdipyz,1588626059.0,"It takes some dogs a while. I know everyone has these big plans when they get a dog. They want to train them and do things with them and play with them and thats of course lovely but your dog doesnt have a bond with you yet. New place, new home, new person. Its a lot. Your a stranger. Even after a few months you still may not be as bonded as youd like. Its like meeting a person. Sure you can get along after only knowing each other for a few weeks but are they really going to trust you? Nah. It takes time to build a real relationship. So we just have to patiently wait and accept that we may not be able to do all the things we planned with our dogs till they are ready.  Keep trying different things he may warm up to it or youll find something eventually he likes

My dog was a rescue. Got her at a year old. She was pretty uninterested in me and toys n stuff too for the first few months. I couldnt blame her though she was probably passed around to 3-4 ppl through her life from shelters and fosters etc. Probably didnt expect me to stick around either. Id say it took a good 2 years to finally feel like she was totally bonded with me. Like she actually liked me, listened to me, and respected me lol and that took alot of effort on my part too. I just kept training. Even trained her how to play lol. All of that helps bond. Its a big change for a dog. Can take a long time. Just take it day by day it will happen but its a relationship. It takes time to build trust and respect. Once your dog gets more comfortable im sure hell start to loosen up. Like someone said it can take a while for a full dogs personality to show when theyve been through the ringer. Just keep trying. Dont give up. Hell come around slowly."

solotravel,fpgr5k0,t3_gdcvi3,1588608004.0,"With most hostels its a walk in and ask type of situation. They don't typically ""hire"" before hand because there is so much turn over and usually someone already there willing to take the spot. I think some HI HOTELS may have paid positions available if you look on their website but if your planning on travelling around its typically work for free accommodation and maybe meals  if the hostel serves food. In that case you do not need a work visa. There wont be any actual money exchanging hands. As others have said its really based on luck. Ive been some places where there was a line up of ppl waiting to get a position with them but one place i ended up working in i just got lucky. Someone had just left when i got in so i got a position almost immediately. That was in australia where everyone is looking for accommodation.

It depends where you are traveling as well. When I traveled to central america it was easier and I did set up my work placements before going through workaway.info . Theyve got a lot of hostels all over the world looking for ppl. 

If you actually want to travel abroad to work I would look into a working holiday visa. Its the least complicated and allows you to work regular jobs to make money."

And this article is focused on patients of mental health professionals committing suicide not mental health professionals suicides. Oy vey. 

Alright im sincerely going to stop the back and forth here im starting to get the feeling your either young or i duno but I do hope you open your mind a bit because if you ever have someone you know with any of these conditions this point of view is quite hurtful to have and not helpful to anyone. Theres a lot of bad out there hunny and professional help doesnt help everyone. I know they like to tout it on TV like if you get help youll be cured but that isn't the reality for a lot of people. Sorry to burst your bubble. Have you ever worked with mental health patients? because I've been around them for 10 years and I promise you it is not nearly as simple as you seem to think it is.

She didnt seem to be a fan of the spreads like peanut butter or cheese or whatever else you put in those things. I think the kong has a lot of hype but not every dog is into it. She likes the bobble toys. Where she can just knock around something and hard food comes out. Some dogs arent food driven though some will much rather play. You may have to change your reward from treats to a favourite toy like a tug of war toy or perhaps  just a good praise is good enough for your dog. A dog can typically be trained with one of those 3 options.

Do you also realize that most mental illness isn't a ""get help and your fixed"" situation? Most people struggling with any mental illness will struggle their entire life and people who go get help and get better are VERY lucky. People with eating disorders often relapse many times before recovering if they ever do. Its like assuming because a drug addict went to rehab they are now better. That would be nice but for many people that isn't the case. Helpâ‰ Recovery.

Alot of people who are overweight complain about it because nobody likes being fat and most people make an ASSUMPTION that people who dont go on diets or arent loosing weight arent trying. You are ALL making assumptions about overweight people. Highly doubt ANY fat person is telling you i want to lose weight but dont want to do anything about it. So how about you learn what the word ignorant means and then use it on yourself. THANKS!
BingeEatingDisorder,fpckgkr,t3_gcn8jt,1588503905.0,"Its like when people say ""im having an anxiety attack"" when they are a little stressed or ""im so depressed"" when they are a little bummed out. Its mostly just ignorant people using words they've heard to overly describe a minor feeling they have. Its mostly pure ignorance or attention seeking. Either way its best to try to ignore it because you can just assume they have no actually idea what they are talking about or they wouldn't be talking about it in those context. 

Most people dont seem to have empathy unless they've gone through things personally and this is another one of those things that people dont understand the gravity of it unless theyve experienced it. 

When it comes to binging remarks on social media you can almost guarantee most of those people know they aren't binging and are only saying that because their low self esteem tells them they need to try to make it look like they eat healthy or whatever. Remember everything on social media is for other peoples approval. If someone is saying that they prob have issues of their own so I try not to let it get to me too much."
BingeEatingDisorder,fpcj47z,t3_gcn9i7,1588502454.0,"Here's a few options of starting places

1. Promise yourself you will never diet again. Restricting food will always lead to binging

2. Do not weight yourself, measure yourself, or set weight loss goals for yourself. The pressure of these deadlines and ultimate ""failure"" when we don't meet them lead to shame, guilt, and feeds our binging urges. 

3. Figure out what emotions you feel when you want to binge. Is it happy, sad, angry, anxiety, all of the above? Figure out your trigger. Knowledge is power. If you know what emotions are triggering the urges you can better predict and notice when they are coming which can help you curb them. 

4. Google healthy coping mechanisms. When you figure out your triggers try one of these coping mechanisms instead of binging. If you still binge its okay. Keep trying. Practice makes perfect and it may take a lot of tries to find one that works for you

5. Give yourself a break. Every meal is a new meal. If you binge. Its okay. Say to yourself. ""okay i binged, its okay, im a work in progress"" and move forward . Breaking the shame cycle is important.

6. Eat. Just eat. Get a variety of food. Try not to lable it as ""good"" or ""bad"" just buy food. Get some salads, fruits, veggies, burgers, chicken, frozen pizza. Get a variety of food from all areas of the grocery store. Stuff you want to eat and stuff you should probably be eating more of and dont think about your meals. Just eat. If you want the pizza eat it. No guilt or shame. Its just food. Just eat it. If you have a certain food thats REALLY triggering then avoid it but dont do it with all foods. You want a variety of food so you can train yourself to eat like a normal person again. Showing yourself you can eat a variety of food and its okay. If you do this you are much less likely to binge because you are giving yourself permission to eat what you like. You will likely still eat alot more of the food you like over the other food the first few weeks and thats okay because if you can do this and the above you will start to notice your binges reducing and trust me its not the food your eating that is really causing the problems its the act of binging. I still ate most of the food i liked in the first 2 months of my recovery and i lost weight simply from not binging. It took me a long time to even remember what ""normal"" eating looked like. I was always ""on"" or ""off"" a diet. Its important that we learn how to eat normally again"
BingeEatingDisorder,fpcihjy,t3_gc0gkl,1588501765.0,"Straight up if you want recovery you shouldn't be counting calories or fasting period. If you really want recovery you need to allow yourself to accept you cannot diet because of your eating disorder. You need to learn to eat like a normal person again. Which means just eating. Not worrying about calories or fat or anything. Just eating and sorting out WHY you binge. What emotions is it linked to and learning coping mechanisms to deal with those emotions when they come on instead of turning to food. I promise you most of the people you will hear from that are in recovery are there because they quit restricting food. I know it doesnt make sense. Eat whatever i want to lose weight? But with an ED its all about the psychology and restricting feeds our binging urges. I really encourage you to give up the counting, give up the weighing, give up the ""goals"" and just eat food. 

When i finally accepted all the above. When I let go of trying to control my weight I finally gained control of my weight and lost a ton more weight then i ever did with diets."
BingeEatingDisorder,fpci0mw,t3_gcdfle,1588501309.0,"Obviously you know but I will say it because I truly do want everyone on here to get better. You will not stop binging if you keep restricting. Its a cycle and an eating disorder cycle for a reason. The restrictions will lead to binging. It's just not sustainable. It just isn't not for a regular person but especially not for someone with an ED. I encourage you to focus on your mental health on why you binge and other coping mechanisms you can explore that does not have to do with food. Your weight and will power are not the issue. Your coping skills are. All work that can be done while eating regular food without restriction. 

Thats my 2 cents. 

Goodluck"
