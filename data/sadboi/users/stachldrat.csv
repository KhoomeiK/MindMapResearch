https://andrewhammel.blog/2019/02/27/why-is-there-straw-everywhere-and-the-naturalness-of-german-pornography/

> Pop culture generates random flecks of absurdity which lodge themselves in a nation’s soul. In Germany, one of these gems is this scene from a 2002 movie Eighteen-and-a-half (g), a type of flick we used to call a ‘specialty feature’ in English:

>    Girl: “So, here’s the fuse box we’re having problems with, so you can take a look.”

>    Man: “Sure, but why is there straw everywhere?”

>    Girl: “Why are you wearing a mask?”

>    Man: [sighs] “Oh well. How ’bout a blowjob?”

> Someone found this stretch of dialogue amusing, and stuck it on the Internet in 2002. It went viral, as they say, and now every German under the age of 40 knows this scene. All you have to do is mention “straw lying around” somewhere and people will break out in knowing smirks"
