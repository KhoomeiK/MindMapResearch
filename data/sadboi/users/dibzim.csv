NYKnicks,fqa5ir7,t1_fqa5hd9,1589213189.0,"The wing is the most brutal, which is tough since the Knicks could really use help there. Evan Fournier is an option, depending on how much the Magic are willing to pay him, but he would be a little small starting next to Barrett. There are no centerpieces, but Derrick Jones Jr, Jae Crowder, Maurice Harkless, Glenn Robinson III, Marvin Williams and Justin Holiday would all make the rotation better, so hopefully one or more are interested and not overpriced.

I like Wood as a fit for the Knicks, but do they need another big man? If he ends up getting less than the $10 million non-taxpayer mid-level exception, it could be worth it just to add talent, and they could run some two-big lineups with him and Mitchell Robinson together. I would be looking at a lower price point, ideally a floor spacer like Aron Baynes or Chris Boucher who could be comfortable with a more limited role. Perry could also roll the dice on DeMarcus Cousins, which I would do only if the team gets some sort of light guarantee for 2021-22 in case it works out.

Vorkunov: Cousins would definitely be an interesting signing. I even think he and Robinson could play together occasionally if the Knicks want to go big in the front court occasionally. (Warning: We have no idea what kind of basketball the Knicks want to play under Rose, so this has to all be hypothetical; Rose has no historical record to go off.)

The thing I’ll be watching for is if the Knicks change their behavior with their cap space. Last summer they deliberately chose not to use their room to add bad contracts as a way to also add future assets. That’s how a Portis or Gibson happened instead of a Moe Harkless trade or an Andre Iguodala deal. Knowing that this could be an offseason that might be different regardless, do you see any players out there who might be on the trade block because their teams will want to move their contracts and pay to do so? Or do you think because the free agent class is relatively weak and because so few teams have space, that might not be an avenue teams go down this offseason?

I do wonder if some teams will try to lower their payrolls for the 2020-21 season because the lack of revenue from this season will cause them to cut their budgets, forcing them to trade off moderately pricey contracts they would have otherwise kept.

Leroux: This is where the cap number becomes a big issue. At the $115 million official estimate, most teams look firmly in the area between the salary cap and the luxury tax, which rarely brings urgency to shed salary. As I broke down a little while back, that dynamic totally changes with a cap drop because then some teams shift to being over the tax and teams that were already taxpayers, like the Nets and Warriors, get significantly more expensive.

A few names to keep an eye on in either scenario: Al Horford (76ers), Rodney McGruder (Clippers), Cody Zeller (Hornets), Patrick McCaw (Raptors), Terrence Ross or Al-Farouq Aminu (Magic) and Doug McDermott (Pacers). There are no urgent cap-clearing front offices knowing what we know now, but inevitably there will be opportunities in that vein, though likely not nearly as fruitful as the 2019 offseason.

Vorkunov: The unknown factor in all this: how long Rose want to take to rebuild the Knicks? Does he want to be competitive for a playoff spot in 2020-21 or use it as a bridge year?

What do you think is the Knicks’ best path to being a playoff team again? And do you think Barrett and Robinson will be integral pieces when that happens?

Leroux: It is a pretty long road back to respectability, especially since star free agents are generally choosing well-run teams with competitive rosters, meaning the Knicks likely need to figure out some big things instead of having a newcomer lift them into a perennial playoff team. That said, the playbook is pretty simple: make the best draft picks possible, accumulate as much young talent as they can, fill in the roster with logical complementary players, and avoid committing long-term to players unless the front office is sure they will fit in wherever things go.

How does that apply to this specific situation? Take the best prospect possible in the 2020 draft irrespective of whether he overlaps with Barrett, Robinson or anyone else because it is not clear they will be the cornerstone of a great team down the line, though they absolutely could be. After all, having multiple players who are good but do not fit together is a far better problem to have than lacking the talent in the first place. Beyond that, the Knicks should be looking to add free agents who shoot well enough for opponents to stick on them, opening up the paint for drivers like Barrett and roll men like Robinson. That way, they can learn whether that pick-and-roll combination can be a centerpiece of their offense moving forward.

From a timeline perspective, a goal should be having enough information to evaluate their young talent before their next contracts. Robinson will either be a restricted free agent in 2021 (my preference) or unrestricted in 2022, but Barrett’s next contract will start in 2023, which is a lot more time. Hopefully by then the front office will have a good idea whether Barrett can be the lead initiator on a viable offense and whether his jump shot has progressed enough to work off-ball. During that time, the Knicks will have a number of other bites at the apple in terms of the draft and trades, with success being their best path to accelerating the timetable in a sustainable way.

This process does not have to be slow; it just requires the right players to progress into contention. Dallas made the jump to legit playoff team in Luka Doncic’s second season while Houston never dropped below .500 because they traded for James Harden in 2012. Of course, finding foundational pieces requires a lot going right, including plenty of luck, though front offices can both create more opportunities and make the most of the opportunities they get. The Knicks will have to do both of those to climb their way out of this hole."
NYKnicks,fqa5hd9,t3_ghqdr1,1589213170.0,"There’s a level of instability running through the NBA right now. No one really knows if or when the 2019-20 season will resume. Or when the next season will start as a result of that. There will be implications for the cap and for teams in free agency.

To get an idea of how those things will hit the Knicks and how they can maneuver through them, Mike Vorkunov, The Athletic’s Knicks beat reporter, and Danny Leroux, The Athletic’s resident cap guru, discussed what the future could look like for the organization and the decisions they’ll need to make.

Vorkunov: Well, Danny, we’re here. Having listened to your podcasts a few times before, I know you haven’t always been a fan of their moves and decisions. Let’s see what you have to say of the future.

The Knicks enter this offseason in an interesting place. They’ll have max cap room if they want it. They can essentially customize their cap space by deciding whether to pick up the various team options or non-fully guaranteed deals on the roster. I’ve been wondering how this suspended season will impact their cap room and what New York can do with it. We’ve already seen presumptions and estimates that the cap will fall by a generous amount. What’s your thought on where the cap might land and how that could impact the Knicks?

Leroux: Guessing the 2020-21 cap is really tough because the players and owners can collectively bargain the number instead of relying on this season’s income. Both sides have an incentive to not make it unreasonably low because that would lead to a shortfall and cap spike in 2021-22. I do not have any intel, but something around the $107 million I used as a theoretical cap figure feels right.

The Knicks are a fascinating and challenging example because they have so much flexibility. Having light partial guarantees on Reggie Bullock, Elfrid Payton, Taj Gibson and Wayne Ellington allows the front office to choose which players are worth keeping with a comparatively small cost if they decide that price is not justified.

In a normal offseason, I would be more confident that a lower-than-expected cap would be bad for them as one of the few franchises with cap space. However, it might be a slight disadvantage that actually helps long-term for a couple reasons.

First, this is a weak free agent class, especially for a roster that is a long way from contention. Most of the class consists of veterans who will not be starter quality a few seasons from now. There are some restricted players like Brandon Ingram and Malik Beasley that fit, but their current teams will match any reasonable offer sheets. A lower salary cap diminishes the Knicks’ spending power but without major consequences.

Second and most importantly, it may protect the front office. Leon Rose decided to bring back Scott Perry for just the 2020-21 season, creating a potential incentive for him to use resources to make the team more competitive in the immediate. After all, a more successful Knicks season makes it more likely that Rose retains Perry and that he can find a job elsewhere. (I broke down these pressures using this specific situation recently.) This would have two big consequences: long-term salary owed to players who do not fit the timeline of their young core and weakening their draft picks as the front office builds the foundation. There are exceptions, of course, but the Knicks face a real risk of short-term pressure to skip steps, short-changing their eventual ceiling.

Vorkunov: Assuming there isn’t any steep drop and the cap does land around $107 million for next season, what is the Knicks’ situation heading into this offseason? They have picks (seven over the next four years). They can make a good number of roster changes. Their roster is basically Play-Doh. They can twist it and turn it over how they want, with eight players who can become free agents this summer. But they also need to decide whether to keep any of them to include their contracts in trades. Is, say, Bobby Portis more valuable to them on the team next season at $15 million or better off as a trade piece with a tidy salary that can be slotted in if needed or not wanted on the team at all? How do you handicap the Knicks’ position in free agency and where they can go?

Leroux: While a lower cap is absolutely a possibility, let’s use the most recent official projection of $115 million. Assuming the Knicks retain all fully guaranteed players and end up with the sixth pick in the draft, their maximum cap space would be around $50 million. Of course, that includes waiving and stretching the $1 million partial guarantees owed to four players: Bullock ($4.2 million full salary), Payton ($8 million), Gibson ($9.5 million) and Ellington ($8 million). Each of those are separate decisions but fit together since they determine how much cap space New York has to use.

Keeping Bullock seems like an obvious choice since he is a positive value at that price, so Perry could trade him if the return is strong enough. Payton is probably worth keeping since he can be a part of the point guard rotation. Gibson and Ellington have weaker arguments to return at their salaries. Portis is an easy decision for me because big men who cannot defend well have to be very strong in other areas, and he does not do nearly enough to justify a $15.8 million price tag. If we include Damyean Dotson’s cap hold, too, the Knicks would have about $37 million to spend, enough to add some talent that makes sense around their young core.

Vorkunov: To me, only Bullock seems like somewhat of an easy decision to retain for next season. Payton’s future might be determined by whether New York wants to take a point guard in the draft. The point guard options in free agency aren’t great, unless it’s at the top of the market, like Fred VanVleet.

The effects of short-term pressures are real in New York. Knicks history is littered with examples. We’ll see which way Rose takes the organization; maybe his plan involves a quicker turnaround than we’re all thinking. One option that has been floating around is a trade for Chris Paul. Obviously that kind of deal would be difficult to pull off, and we don’t even know if the Thunder would want to do it. Paul is still really good, and the Thunder are in a different spot right now than we thought they’d be when the season began. But let’s play this out, how do you think a trade for Paul could work out? And would you do it?

Leroux: The mechanics of acquiring Paul are not particularly difficult thanks to the Knicks’ cap space, but the other factors in negotiations are hard to predict. The 35-year old will make $41.4 million in 2020-21 and has a $44.2 million player option for 2021-22, his age-36 season. That leaves two people who need to align on the value of that contract: Perry and Sam Presti. If Presti and the Thunder feel like Paul is worth that price tag, it will be hard to negotiate a trade. New York should not be willing to commit further assets and tie up 2021 flexibility for a post-prime star, especially since Paul’s presence in particular would weaken future draft picks necessary to build a strong long-term foundation.

If, on the other hand, Presti wants to take his foot off the accelerator and re-tool around Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Knicks taking on Paul’s final two seasons could be more of a help. In that case, the asset return for OKC should be limited — maybe someone young but not in the Knicks’ plans, like Frank Ntilikina or Dennis Smith Jr. — and that might be palatable for New York.

My opinion would be that the Knicks should not acquire Paul because this is not the time to skip steps. It takes years of talent accumulation to build a young core that can ascend. Paul would help guys like RJ Barrett now, but then be gone before they are truly ready to shine. Instead, New York should make more modest moves for players who can space the floor and ideally compete on defense to play alongside Barrett, Mitchell Robinson and whoever they draft over the next few years. That will eventually lead to a better outcome, with good management and a little luck.

Vorkunov: That’s fair. Aligning timelines will be an important part of what Rose does as president. The Knicks have this small stable of young talent that’s still a few years away, and they need to bridge that gap somehow without undercutting themselves again.

This free agent market isn’t going to be particularly strong, and that’s before we know how many of the players with player options decide to stay on their current deal for one more year and try free agency next summer. Who do you think could make sense for the Knicks this offseason? Two intriguing options who are still young but would be toward the top of the market are VanVleet and Christian Wood. Where do you peg the contracts they’ll receive?

Leroux: Free agent fits with the Knicks are tough because ideal players need to check a lot of boxes, including being good shooters and capable defenders who are young enough to fit with the team long-term. VanVleet is 26, but aligns as a tenacious defensive player that works on and off the ball. It feels like he will get about $15 million to $18 million per season, but contract length will be key. That is a totally reasonable price for him over the next few years, but a four-year deal could get thorny at the end if the Knicks are at another stage in their process. I would also look at Goran Dragic, Jevon Carter and Shabazz Napier at point guard, depending on the price point."
