If it collapses we will revert back, and once again be subject to natural selection.  At that point distance would separate populations and evolution would cause a divergence.  Some humans would live in the forest and adapt with sharper ears.  Some humans would become shorter cave dwellers and utilize the resources of the earth.  Some humans would become hateful pillagers and raiders that exist to take resources from other races.  Some humans would stay in temperate climates and remain relatively the same.

It can make you some money while you pursue a more stable and lucrative career path.  I would say the best skill I learned from doing personal training was how to talk and listen to people.  

As for a certification I did NASM which was a good personal training course.  Back in 2011 the course cost about $800.  It was very thorough and the test was one of the hardest tests I have ever taken and I have a masters degree.  

I am a little concerned you won’t be competitive compared to some of the other trainers.  Most of them will be much older, more experienced, and educated.  You could be a fitness guru now, but if I was a client I am not sure I would want someone who just graduated high school to be my trainer.  

I am also unsure of how you will work with clients in the current economic climate.  Most gyms around the world are closed"
