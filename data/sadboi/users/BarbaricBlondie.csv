AskFDS,fp18i4t,t3_ganl9c,1588227464.0,"Personally, I think it's best to surround yourself with people who inspire you to be the best person you can be. I recently got out of a toxic relationship of 3 years with a LVM. I was not myself because of not only the abuse, but his friends and family who really had no aspirations in life and were all around broken.  I began to accept their ideas as my own because it was all I saw.

Coming out of the relationship and surrounding myself with those I respect has changed me (or returned me) to who I wish to be in life.

I do have some LV friends, but I keep them at quite a distance. While it can be painful to cut those ties, I truly believe it serves me incredibly well in the long run."

If I had to summarize, I think the most important things that aided in her longevity are diet, exercise, supplements, and frequent vet visits. For diet - I feed her Solid Gold when I'm too lazy to cook (usually crack an egg in there). When I do cook for her, I often feed her liver, chicken breast, eggs, carrots, pumpkin, or spinach. As for exercise, things look a lot different now in her old age! When she was more mobile, we ran everyday and hiked usually once every two weeks. We supplemented her with Glucosamine (Cosequin) since she was 3 as she has hip dysplasia and arthritis. Also Probiotics/Prebiotics, salmon oil. In her old age, lots of varying medication for pain management but usually CBD oil on the easier days and NSAIDS and Tramadol on harder ones. We stayed on top of vet visits and bloodwork, and luckily discovered her thyroid issues amongst other things that we could treat.

Oh, and teeth brushing! I'm sorry if this was too large of a response, but it's difficult to summarize years of care lol. Hope you are well and I wish your dogs the very best!"

NarcissisticAbuse,fmizkry,t3_fvi7ol,1586120070.0,"One thing that has greatly helped me when I fall back into this loop is what my therapist told me. To paraphrase, he said that narcissists lack the ability to reflect, or ""put the mirror up"", as he always called it. It would be very rare, for someone with NPD to ruminate and reflect on their own flaws, or if they even had a hand in any of the problems in the relationship. 

Personally, I was incredibly trapped because my nex was a very conniving, well-worded man. He would own up to VERY FEW things - only when it would benefit him overall (of course at the time I didn't see it that way). With my black and white thinking, it was difficult to wrap my mind around. He also told me that I was the narcissist, manipulative one. I'm in the same boat as you, just trying to unravel all the years of abuse and borderline brainwashing. 

At the end of the day, if you're pondering your own flaws and wondering if you were the issue whilst you were constantly going out of your way to fix problems in the relationship - it is highly doubtful that you hold NPD traits.

Another thing that has helped me enormously was a book by Shannon Thomas LCSW, called ""Healing from Hidden Abuse"". I listened to it for free on Libby. Honestly, I think it's about time I reread it for my own recovery.

No human should have to go through this twisting of reality. We'll make it through this! ❤"

I'm roughly 3.5 months no-contact and I have lost my sex drive, completely. I generally have a very high sex drive, and for the first time in my adult life it is simply nonexistent. I resonated with the article you mentioned in that sex was the silver lining in my abusive relationship, even though it was often withheld from me as a tool of punishment and emotional witholding. 

I think it's normal to feel this way, we've been through some very difficult, yet unique experiences with our nex. I desperately miss the sex (with only him) but I think there is a lot more baggage ruling those feelings rather than just lust. I believe our sex-drive will come back eventually as we recover.

Your input is very helpful; however, I am curious about your little note at the end. Perhaps you have some experience regarding ESAs and rentals? If so, I'd love to hear it! I'm having a lot of family/friends urge me to simply move into a property (managed by professional management) and then bring my dog with all of my updated ESA papers. From my understanding, it would be in violation of CA FEHA to evict me on this basis. 

Nearly all listings within my price range ($900) have a strict 'No Pet Policy'. Would you recommend approaching these property management companies beforehand about my ESA dog? I feel that it is unlikely that they would actually comply with FEHA law.

I value any help that comes my way, thanks again! :)"

By loose, do you mean if I present them with my ESA Papers (therapist/Dr) before signing they are more likely to not turn me down? I know I'm legally protected, but that doesn't protect me if I'm upfront with them regarding my dog. I'm sure they could easily say they have another applicant they are choosing over me...

I highly recommend reading The Verbally Abusive Relationship by Patricia Evans and perhaps when you're further along Healing From Hidden Abuse by Shannon Thomas. You can rent them for free on Libby (app) and read or listen to them if you'd rather not have a physical book that the abuser can see.

AskReddit,fkyu2a2,t3_flgaml,1584656160.0,"I'm a bartender at a restaurant. Monday night was our last dine-in service. Supposedly we are still doing takeout.. but the only person allowed to do it is the newly promoted manager (w/only hosting and 3 months serving experience). Looks like I should have been doing the owner as well! 

But in all seriousness, none of us bartenders, servers, support staff have any clue if we will ever open again. Restaurants are generally pretty difficult to keep afloat and from my understanding we were already struggling. I filed for unemployment and am looking for work. Super fun!"
abusiverelationships,fkyje31,t3_fla85w,1584649907.0,"Firstly, I want to thank you (so much) for sharing this. I honestly teared up a bit - because I could have sincerely written this myself. I'm even more thankful because I still struggle to put all my thoughts, experiences, and emotions regarding the traumatically abusive relationship into words.

I cannot express to you how much I relate to what you have shared. Especially regarding your ""inner gaslighting"" trying to make you feel like what you were saying was complete lie and that you were somehow managing to leave out the part where it was all your fault. This is what I've been trying to put into words myself. I am immensely struggling with this very thing. Sometimes I catch myself thinking ""Oh no, they're going to figure out I'm lying!"" When I am in fact, being as unbiased and honest I could be with my words.

I've been far more open about sharing the truth now that I'm 3 months no contact. I'm always concerned that I'm somehow lying and that the friends I'm sharing with will doubt me or wonder what I did wrong to deserve it. All due to immense amount of gaslighting. He always told me I ""was incapable of telling the truth"" and thus any feedback I recieved from friends and family ""was just a reflection of your own lies."" Talk about crazy-making. My nex also told me that I didn't have ""nearly enough life experience as him"" (20 year age gap) and that he knew me better than anyone else. I began filming his angry screaming and shouting (secretly) because of this very thing - along with telling me that certain awful things he told me were never said. 

I was losing my sanity - and to this day I AM SO GLAD that I recorded it. When he found out I was recording, he was furious. Upon reflection, I know the real reason why. It's very tough to argue with hard evidence such as film and voice recordings. 

Everyday, I regret not sending him off to prison for the physical, emotional, verbal, and most sadistic physcological abuse. Especially after I ended up in a hospital form a concussion he gave me. He was already on parole for a violent crime and he would have been gone in an instant. The only reason I backed out everytime was because of my dear love for his daughter. 

I apologize for the word vomit - but your words have given me a more sturdy medium with which to share my experiences. It seems that you are well on your way in recovery! Vert happy for you. I'm looking forward to being there myself.

I wish you all of the best, friend!"

Honestly, I know you're being downvoted to high hell - but I don't completely disagree with you! I see where you're coming from. Trust me - I'm not about the chaos! I am loosing my job because of this panic and filing for unemployment today. Staying afloat will be tough.

My main concern is I live with my elderly father who is someone who could potentially be severely affected by this. I'm already more likely to be exposed as a bartender, but purposefully coming back from international travel from a country on total quarantine is just negligent.

However, with this said - don't you think that in times of over-panic and precautionary measures that it would be better with someone in her position to stay home? My hunch is that people like this woman are the reason that Gov. Newsome (CA) is calling for all restaurants to shut down - which I do think is overboard. In the end, takeout could have been easily done instead, and we would have been happy to do so!"
TalesFromYourServer,fkrev1z,t1_fkrelha,1584467471.0,"From what I understand, yes! Just a selfish little turd. We offer takeout so there really is no excuse."
TalesFromYourServer,fkrdb04,t1_fkr5j3x,1584466584.0,Agreed! She only told her server as she was paying out. We sanitized the hell out of her booth!
TalesFromYourServer,fkrd50t,t1_fkqv949,1584466490.0,Agreed. I'm just so annoyed that she even had the audacity to share that so nonchalantly.
TalesFromYourServer,fkrd0q4,t1_fkr3ifg,1584466423.0,Right?! I have an elderly dad to come home to! Not so worried about my health as I'm young - but worried about potentially transmitting it to him!
