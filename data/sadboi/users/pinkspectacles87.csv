science,fnwmuux,t3_g3kt1p,1587321416.0,What if you isolate yourself from friends and family and donâ€™t end up lonely? Not speaking for myself but someone I know. Used to be super close but he pushed me away like most people he knows and admits he doesnâ€™t feel lonely or isolated as a result

But yes Iâ€™m racked with guilt all the time knowing what I have and still suffering from depression. Itâ€™s not like I choose to, my life would be much easier if I were mentally healthy"

depression,epvttrf,t3_bw3aw3,1559550577.0,"I agree with everyone saying leave social media. Best thing I ever did.

If you don't have RL social skills, are there online spaces you could ""meet"" people? I say that because I've had depression for most of my life and always been a bit of an outsider and weirdo (bullied a lot at school and have never had many friends) but I found my ""tribe"" on a gaming/anime forum and even met my now-husband there. I speak to most of the people I know online and we talk about our shared interests. I joined that forum 13 years ago and still login every day to chat to people and we hang out regularly IRL. 32 years old now and can say the friends thing does get better, you just have to find your place in the world :)

What are some interests you have?"
