AmItheAsshole,eoivwvi,t1_eoiuyoq,1558628393.0,his feelings do count but still Her body her choice.  i wouldn't marry someone with such shit poor tattoo tastes as yer example and i wouldn't stay married to some one who wanted to get that tattoo.  Like if my wife said she really wanted that dick tattoo  in earnest i would question staying in that marriage because of her judgment not whether or not she actually gets the tattoo.  If i prevent her from getting foreheaddicktattoo she is still someone who wants that tattoo. Even if i stifle her she would still be a person with poor judgment and i would leave because of her poor judgment not the tattoo.
AmItheAsshole,eoikyjc,t1_eoijvhv,1558621975.0,You are right. I was too quick to judge. I just have a hard time understanding wanting to control where your so gets tattoos. Imo if you don't trust your so's judgement on tasteful tattoos (wherever they may be) you might not want to be with them. But that is my own personal bias. cheers.
AmItheAsshole,eoij29d,t1_eoietsh,1558620811.0,I am glad you made this comment. Can't believe how many people think his behavior is fine.  Why are people still so shitty about tattooS? get the stick outta yer ass op. Hope she finds someone else.
