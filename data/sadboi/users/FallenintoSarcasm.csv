Anxiety,fo0yb4u,t3_g4y8e7,1587422081.0,"Story of my fucking life. 

I was always ""smart."" To the point my parents fought tooth and nail trying to get me into advanced programs in elementary and middle school. It wasn't until middle school I took ""advanced"" classes. In high school, I did pre-AP, AP and dual-enrollment courses. I did have to study for a few classes, but rarely very much. Hell, I even took classes during the summer and graduated with my associate's degree two weeks before my high school graduation. 

Eventually, I went to the university near me. (Granted, I didn't really want to go there, but it was a ""good option"" considering it is a good school and close by. Plus there was the percieved implication of ""you aren't ready to leave the nest yet"" from my family.) 

But here's the other half of the story: I was lowkey suicidal and very depressed most of middle school and freshman year of high school. Sophomore year was a clusterfuck but I managed to pass with As and Bs despite not turning a lot of shit in. (People said that was my fault, but truth be told, I was too anxious or too depressed to do the work.) I suffered anxiety attacks all throughout high school from self-imposed pressure, if I wasn't being pressured by my parents. 

My childhood consists of being told ""to remember to be a kid"" and ""you need to grow up"" at the same time. And never having time to be a kid due to my studies. Other people also got degrees in less time than me, because of a new program. Being a high school student and graduating community college was never recognized for me: it was for others though. 

College was another beast. The first year, aside from the fallout of a major life events, was hell. I was questioned as to why I wasn't more involved when I couldn't drive myself since I didn't have a license (was forced to get one last summer after fighting it for three years). I have fought myself and everything going on in my head for years but...I have crippling self-doubt. 

I have done well, despite everything. But I procrastinate, I have anxiety attacks sometimes if things get real bad. I NEVER get a good nights sleep. I used school as a means to distract myself. 

But if I was being honest? Completely painfully honest? I never would have done those things even if it means being in a good place at young age. 

I don't think I really want to go to grad school. I don't think I really wanted to go into psychology. Originally I wanted to be an artist. A multimedia artist. 

But I didn't mesh well with the art and animation kids. I didn't feel I was gonna be good enough for that. So I took the safe route. Part of me regrets that. 

And I like psychology but...I often worry I won't make it. I won't get through grad school. That all the misery I put myself through would be for nothing. That I won't find a job or be a shitty psychologist. 

Sometimes I really fear the only thing I will ever be good at is school."
Anxiety,fntsam9,t1_fntk8vt,1587247714.0,"It's a super weird feeling and I never knew how to describe it. Shaking on the inside is probably the best way to describe it because that is exactly how it feels. 

For me, specifically in my experience, I can move around like normal, as if nothing is happening when this IS happening. So it's kinda trippy to see nothing happening, but feeling the sensation something is. It obviously doesn't feel like I am moving normally, but to an outsider's perspective, I'm probably not moving any different, except maybe a bit slower and slightly more cautiously. 

I just wondered if someone else has ever experienced it. Thank you!"

Anxiety,fntfn1e,t3_g3tvhs,1587240688.0,"I do this. I tend to listen to music a lot in general, cause it gives my brain something to focus. And also mediate my emotions and thoughts, as both are very fast paced...which results in a lot of fast paced rock/metal music. 

But if I am particularly anxious, I tend to listen to guitar instrumentals, slow indie songs, or anything that has kinda soulful singing to it. Generally, slower paced songs. 

Right now, due to being super anxious, it's been ""Demons"" by Jacob Lee and anything Rag'n'Bone Man in particular."
unt,fmjnbvb,t3_fvml04,1586133796.0,"Contact the department chair and if that doesn't work, the dean for the college. And maybe send screenshots of the emails and the issue to them. You tried to reach out, solve the issue, and informed with the professor. You did the responsible thing. They shouldn't fault you for a technical screw up that isn't your fault, and when you don't have the usual resources at campus."
unt,fmgsyl3,t3_fv5c1w,1586057002.0,"That's a mood. I'm lucky enough to not have to worry about bills and a job putting me at risk (but I'm also living at home and out of work because of this whole thing) but it makes it hard to focus on school. I have been having a hard time doing anything at home, especially schoolwork. 

I don't know if this helps or not, and you may have already seen this, but UNT did say that they were giving a pass/no pass option. 

If you fail, its automatically put in as a no pass/fail but it doesn't affect your GPA. If you pass, you get the letter grade but can have it changed to a pass. Again, this doesn't do anything to your GPA. At least, if I am understanding the email sent to me right. You also have the end of the semester to decide, since its optional. 

I'd email your advisor for more details though for clarification and info about it if you want to look into it."
unt,fmg7c12,t1_fmg13c2,1586042788.0,"And for those who do work on school or do their job for spend the better part of their day, don't stress about it if you don't pick up a new hobby or project. I personally spend several hours working on school during the week or work on stuff for my research lab.  I don't want to be productive all the damn time. Its unrealistic. 

If finding a new hobby or project works for you, great. If not, then that's okay too. 

Instead of a project you can: 

1) Catch up on chores or cleaning, or little to-dos. Declutter, maybe, bit by bit. 
2) Chat with some friends (via Skype, phone, discord, etc) and joke around, play D&D, or video games. Hell, just have a conversation! 
3) watch an episode of that new Netflix show you've been meaning too. Or watch YouTube videos. If you have roommates or family, have a movie or game night every week. 
4) Read a book before bed, write something, listen to music and dance around.
5) Exercise a bit. Even if it's just walking around outside—minding social distancing of course!
6) If you don't already, and you share a house with people, have a designated space that is yours when you are sick of those people. Go hang out there for an hour or two when you need to, and do something you enjoy or need to do. 
7) Play with your pet if you have one! 

Personally, I think it's healthier to do what helps you in this situation—minding things like social distancing and shelter in place orders. And maybe keep a simple routine, so you have some productive things and some not so productive things to do.   

It doesn't have to be big. It can be little, and very simple. 

The world is gonna be different by the end of this. People's attitudes are gonna be different by the end of this. So will you, regardless of a new hobby or project, because this is affecting everyone in some shape or form. 

If you are gonna take something from this, learn a good work-play balance, how to make time for things you enjoy, and be kind because we are all in a hard time. 

Stay well, lovelies!"

unt,fl1casi,t3_flwd9y,1584726173.0,"Hey! Not a computer science major (psychology and criminal justice double major) but I have been at UNT for the past 3 years, and I'll say it's a pretty good school. Obviously some departments are better than others, but overall it's pretty good. Only department I've ever had an issue with is Spanish (my minor). Everything is pretty organized as far as financial aid and registrar goes, and with you being from OK, you may be able to get in-state tuition. Not sure how that works, but definitely something to ask about. And campus is small enough to where you can walk everywhere in 10 minutes if you book it, unless your class is at Gateway Center. 

Great programs, tons of things to do organizations wise. UPC usually has tons of stuff and free events throughout the semester too. Pretty open environment, and pretty diverse, especially among the student population. The biggest downside to UNT campus is honestly parking."
