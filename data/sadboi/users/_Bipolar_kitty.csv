She marked me for stupid shit like not putting space between stomachache or using were instead of was. I really felt like she did it on purpose. Now I have to retake the whole class when I shouldnt I’m just pretty upset. I understand too how you must have felt and I’m sorry. I’m glad you were able to pick your head up and keep going. That’s where I am rn. I have to push through. That was good advice. I really felt I needed that."
BipolarReddit,fr32xks,t1_fr2zxb5,1589848872.0,"Yea I wish I felt this way. Nothing tends to go right even if I do everything right. I’m learning to just accept that my life is always going to be shit. And not to get excited about shit. I bought a new car (broke a few weeks later can’t afford to get it fixed at all), I was supposed to get a promotion (got fired), had time to pass my class (failed it), car went out radiator (expensive), supposed to graduate (didn’t graduate). Tired man. Just frustrating."
BipolarReddit,fr2upxs,t1_fqxjzpi,1589844260.0,Yea it does. I don’t have a choice but to retake the class and spend money I don’t have. I’m trying to stay strong but I’m having breakdown of my own. I feel like the world is out to get me or something. I can never be happy. It’s frustrating. Definitely does suck.
BipolarReddit,fr2udbx,t1_fqxhkn5,1589844070.0,"Yea it is. I’m sad I got really excited about graduation too. I told all of my friends, co workers and family and now I don’t even want to face them. I feel really low like ima end up depressed. I really put in so much work and she just failed me. I’m still in shock because I can’t retake the class until fall. I told myself I didn’t want to be depressed but I can feel it coming. Everyone’s celebrating graduation and I’m home just sad. Sigh."
BipolarReddit,fr2tzv2,t1_fqx0iwx,1589843860.0,"Really? I’m devastated. I have to sit and watch everyone graduate and it really hurts. I want to cry everyday but crying won’t help. I just gotta suck it up, retake and redo my assignments and pay for the class a second time. I’m ready to go. Honestly I don’t even have the energy to really complain I’m just so bummed about it. I don’t think I deserved to fail or even retake it if I was doing so well. I really believe some professors are just full of shit and could careless about students like me who are “arrogant and on top of all their assignments”. I feel like she’s been waiting for me to fuck up cause she’s been mean to me all semester."
BipolarReddit,fr1jznq,t1_fr1au13,1589821046.0,"Your right. I’m just really upset because she edited our paper 4x and is just now pointing out errors she “missed the first time around”. I wanted to appeal and petition but she’s like head of the dept and probably friends with everyone of the staff members. I highly doubt it would be in my favor and she’d give me a even harder time next semester. I emailed/called her and asked her if I could redo it because the mistakes I made were slight. but she hasn’t responded and probably won’t. I have the option of making this class a No credit class but I spent the whole semesters transcribing and conducting interviews, analyzing survey data, and wrote a whole research report. I’m devastated. I have no other choice. 

I didn’t want to file my bipolar disorder as a disability with the school because I didn’t see a reason too. I felt like it used to interrupt my school work but not anymore. I do feel however next semester I’m going to probably struggle even more because it’s going to be triggered by being back in the same class with the same teacher in the fall semester who is probably going to make me redo all the work I did the first semester. Take the same quizzes I aced. Same boring assignments I completed and passed. I can’t really help the way that I’m feeling. And I really do think if she would have had a classroom I probably would have had some sort of “psychotic break” and do some shit I regret. She’s really dumb in my opinion. 

And you think I should report her comment? It really did bother me. I was highly upset. I wanted to call my psychiatrist and talk to her but my health insurance is fucked up. I’m so stressed it’s ridiculous."
BipolarReddit,fr16oo2,t1_fqy9o2u,1589814276.0,"Man we had a research paper too that had to be error free. I thought it was stupid because no other major had strict req for their research papers. We had to have less than like 15 mistakes it was so stupid. She edited our papers and then started just finding whatever tf mistakes. I didn’t space Incase or stomachache and she marked it wrong. I asked her to let me redo it so I could find my mistakes but she didn’t respond and she’s not going to respond because ima flip tf out and she knows it. She knows I’m upset. But she’s doesn’t care. 

She’s been editing our paper all semester and had a chance to edit our final paper. I did surveys, conducted interviews, created statistical tables over the whole semester and she fails my paper. It makes me feel like I put in hard work to get a good grade I had a (88% before the F) and she just fails me. I’m hoping she lets me use the same data but I doubt it. I can see her making me do this shit all over again. I can also see her failing me for a second time just because. I don’t think I need to retake the whole class for a research paper. I wish she had a real office because I would have gone and destroyed it. Man and you already know how tough I’m taking this. Between meds and online classes I thought it was going to go well. Sigh."
BipolarReddit,fr15sh9,t1_fqx1mk6,1589813794.0,"I wanted to appeal but she’s head of the dept and friends with every other professor. They would all stick together. I wanted to appeal but if I lost, I’m afraid she’s going to make it even harder for me to pass her class in the fall. It is my last class and I’m bummed because that’s it. My paper was really good and I feel I worked hard on it and there’s no reason I need to retake the class. It has mistakes but it’s a 30 pg long paper. It had to be basically error free or she fails the whole paper. Smfh I wish I had a way to express myself to her but she won’t respond back to my messages. And your right fuck her and love me. Next semester ima just act tf up in her class. Fuck that class."
BipolarReddit,fr14p73,t1_fqwskt6,1589813201.0,"Yea. It just doesn’t feel the same. I’m ready to get my diploma but i lost all excitement for it. I really got excited and everything. I have failed my class, wasted my money and let myself down. I believe my teacher did it purposely I believe because there is NO reason I should be getting a high B in my class and my teacher fails my paper. I just cost myself graduation and it sucks. And no ima stay in. I don’t want to celebrate for failure and a failed class. Thank you for your positivity."
BipolarReddit,fr13ruz,t1_fqzcyux,1589812691.0,"I have had a job, many different skills and a very impressive resume. All I was missing was my degree. My paper in my opinion was done very well under the circumstances. But it’s one of those 30pg long no error papers.If I would have gotten any points I would have passed the class with a high B. But she gave me a F for too many errors for stuff like not putting a space between words like Incase, or stomach ache, or using were when she liked the word  was. I personally think it was personal and her way of getting back at me for not being “present” but doing well in her class. I think it had nothing to do with my paper. And unfortunately it is only offered during the fall and spring semester. When I’m able to retake it ima really act up. Give her a reason to not like me. On one of my assignments I screwed up and used the wrong word, and she called me absent minded smdh she’s just a bitch smdh"
mentalillness,fqm3qud,t3_giu6os,1589470989.0,"Yes I do. I write it down “keep going” in multiple places like a journal, sticky note in my car, and day planner when I need to hear it. It kept me going a few times."
bipolar,fps6umf,t3_geyva5,1588868449.0,"I use daylio as a mood journal. It tracks your mood and documents it and creates a chart. I used it a lot when I was first diagnosed to help me notice what my triggers were and how often I am triggered. I’ve been through what you are going through and the best thing for me at that time was meds. I don’t know if you take meds but you probably should ask. They help me with the noisy thoughts and distorted time. I still have episodes often and stability slips through my fingers like water. I definitely understand believing you won’t finish school. And hearing those loud negative thoughts.

I’m a week from graduation and have experienced “lack of focus” when it comes to my studies and never ending procrastination. I’m trying to keep going and force myself to try to finish strong. I’m bipolar as well and I get it. If you need to take some time off you should and go back when you feel ready. 

Someone told me you can get extra time and stuff on your hw and quizzes if you register your bipolar disorder as a disability on campus. I wish I would have known I was bipolar in the beginning. I probably would have done better. Good job on keeping up with that journal. I find reddit is a good online “journal” as well. I also took therapy it helped but meds work a lot faster for the thoughts. Stay safe. Take care."
bipolar,fpo0800,t3_ge7ug3,1588776012.0,I take 300 mgs and honestly it’s good for my bipolar disorder but the sleepiness for me never went away. I have been taking it for a year now and I like it when it works. Sometimes my episodes are too much and I have to go up on it. Overall it’s good for sleep and keeping my thoughts silent (on a good day).
BipolarReddit,fpewa8l,t1_fpc0oou,1588556327.0,"I did that once when I was missing a lot of class. I told my professor that I was dealing with depression and that it was hard to come to class at the time and I would catch up at home. Man I didn’t even know until end of my junior year. I went to the psych at the request of my therapist. I never asked for an extension before I always figured they’d say no. I’m glad your doing well though, school triggered a lot for me."
BipolarReddit,fpe7o0s,t1_fp8vj1w,1588541994.0,Thank you for sharing that with me. I’m definitely going to look into it just Incase I go back to school in the fall. I might email my professor too but idk I might send a strongly worded one so I didn’t respond. I think I should reach out to my psych as well and tell her what’s going on.
BipolarReddit,fpe7dpo,t1_fpaxf5m,1588541830.0,Thanks. I’ve been sleeping the last few days. I gotta get my meds right. But they do give me a sense of peace I never had before.
BipolarReddit,fpda6zu,t1_fp8p00c,1588522973.0,"Wow. I love this I didn’t even know. I do wish I would have taken advantage of this. I didn’t even know it was a disability. I’d I would had known, I’m sure my last semester could have gone so differently. Last semester I ended up passing but I did a lot of damage to my mental health as well. I have in the past, emailed my professors to let them know I didn’t feel good and wouldn’t be coming to class, but I never thought they’d accommodate me having a little more time on exams or a little bit more study time. I’m glad that schools offer things like that. I wish I would have paid more attention to those pamphlets they hand out."
BipolarReddit,fpd8ycd,t1_fp97g03,1588522267.0,"I do feel like I could have used extra help. It greatly affects my work and the quality of work I produce as well. It requires a TREMENDOUS effort for me to just wake up and go to school and work everyday and I was doing a good job. I just think because it’s 12 days before the semester ends, I’m getting senior-itis and it’s affecting my ability to turn in quality work. I’m too busy looking ahead to the end to focus on the present and I’m probably slightly delusional at this time as well. My last assignment grade was terrible because I was medicated, procrastinated, and ended falling asleep during the assignment. Nonetheless, my teacher called me absent-minded and that pissed me off. So now I don’t want to talk to her and explain anything because I just feel she would think it’s an excuse. But I also didn’t know being bipolar was a disability. I would have registered and took advantage of things like that. Smh I got officially diagnosed last year and it’s been a long road to stability. I’m glad it came towards the end of college because I think I’m burned out."
BipolarReddit,fpd4w30,t1_fp9ufv9,1588519891.0,"SAY IT LOUDER. The school system is a failing system and I believe that. There is a sense of “equality” but no equity. A lot of kids come from troubled backgrounds and are expected to perform the same as those who don’t. However, they don’t have access to the same shit as many other kids. So many are at a disadvantage. It’s fuckin ridiculous. The schools will continue to receive funding for each student and students who need help will continue to remain invisible. There are many good teachers out there who fill in that gap, too bad I never had a good one."
BipolarReddit,fpd3261,t1_fp8k1x5,1588518791.0,"Man tell me about it. I never understood how much I was being affected by my disorder until I had to make some drastic changes. I’m scared, nervous and embarrassed to reach out to my instructor for help. I think part of it is pride and another part is I should have told her ahead of time. I thought I had my disorder under control and that I wouldn’t have to explain anything to my professor, but now it’s time for me to open up because it does cause problems. 

My teacher called me absent-minded on my assignment and I was upset about it. I wanted to reach out and give her a peace of my mind but I didn’t. I think her being rude to me and insulting me made me not want to ask for help. I’m going to check out the student needs dept for the future in case I ever wanted to go back to Uni."
BipolarReddit,fpd2hji,t1_fp8sbgf,1588518436.0,Wow congratulations. I feel the same way. I could have made it on the list but I got a B and a C that ruined my gpa. I was really stressed last year with school and I think that really took a toll on me. I used to get all F’s and then all of a sudden my bipolar focused on graduating and I’ve been trying to knock this out for ever. I need to be gentle with myself. I put a lot of stress and pressure on myself and even the smallest of tasks seems like a huge one. Congratulations for graduating. I know how hard it is. I’m working on my thesis now and I’m tired of editing it. I’m ready to just submit it as is.
BipolarReddit,fpd22a2,t1_fpa1s6i,1588518171.0,Really? I think I might message her because I need the help. I was thinking she wouldn’t believe me and I’d have to go to the psych to get a note that says “Bipolar” on it.
BipolarReddit,fpd1yiw,t1_fpbage8,1588518105.0,Yea I’m still on meds. No cbt/dbt right now. So I’m pretty much operating on crazy auto pilot. Aww thanks. I’m going to finish up strong and hurry up and get out of school. And yes it does. It’s like you accomplished something.
BipolarReddit,fpawpq9,t1_fp88nkv,1588457291.0,Yes. And it seems like it’s never ending fatigue. Like you can’t sleep to save your life
BipolarReddit,fpawnyx,t1_fp81vu2,1588457263.0,"Man me too. I go up whenever I can’t sleep. I hate when  I’m tired and can’t sleep so I go up on my meds.

BipolarReddit,fpawi72,t1_fpa29hh,1588457166.0,Really? It’s just seroquel and lamictal for me for now. I can only imagine how tired you must have been man. I’m still recovering from seroquels nasty effects.
BipolarReddit,fpa0wsd,t1_fp8k83z,1588438578.0,"I have before in the past when I was depressed, but I haven’t this semester. I feel like this semester I kind of blew it off and didn’t take it seriously. Now I’m up shits creek with no paddle. It’s a few days til the semester ends and I’ve been dealing with episode for almost two months(triggered by termination of job). I want to reach out to my professor just to inform her about how I’m feeling right now, but honestly she’s not very nice. I definitely should reach out to the school. I would if I wasn’t graduating this year. But if I decide to go for a Master’s I’m going to inform them because I’m going to need the help."
BipolarReddit,fpa0v3v,t1_fp8w7ak,1588438551.0,"I really agree with you. I think I’m embarrassed about really opening up and sharing my mental illness with others. Sometimes I feel like I’m being way to hard on myself. I find that I’m too embarrassed to ask for help because I feel I should know better and I’m “aware” of my own flaws. But your right that bipolar is a monster of its own and can bring us down or feed into our wild ways. See I’m functional as well and I have struggled so much because I didn’t ask for help when I should have. 

Only a few people know I’m bipolar because it’s something I felt I should keep secret. I want to share it but for now it’s only on reddit.  I dropped out for a year and I have failed a few classes. I just kept telling myself it’s only X amount of years. Somehow that worked and I ran with it. I do need to be realistic about my goals because sometimes they are too high and it takes time to achieve them. Yea I’m honest with my SO but not my professor. She’s not very nice but I’m going to try and reach out to her. She is very rude so if I share with her and she responds weird. My hypomania is going to reappear and make a scene."
BipolarReddit,fp9zdd8,t1_fp8fl2e,1588437691.0,"Man. I struggled so hard to try and finish school. Man I should. I did in the past email instructors when I missed a lot of class. Really? I’m kind of ashamed/embarrassed  about being bipolar and using it to explain my b.s attempts at school shit. A lot of you guys told me to check out the disability center. When I joined reddit I realized there were so many people who were bipolar and I felt less alone. Being on here makes me want to open up and ask for help in my real life. 

Yea if I do ever decide to go back I’m going to take advantage of that. All I got really was just a therapist who helped me get diagnosed. One of my assignments I felt like I was “drunk” from my meds and just bullshitted the assignment. Needless to say she emailed me back acting really rude. Yea I should have gone to class but I had a 8am class and it was deathly trying to get up for it. I had another class that stressed me out and made me start self-harming. Man if I would have known I would have signed up.  I definitely needed it a few times."
BipolarReddit,fp9xmfa,t1_fp8xdse,1588436668.0,I’m going to check it out because I may need it if I decide to go back.

I guess I should have said something. I figured she’d not have any compassion for that because the semester is almost over."
BipolarReddit,fp8evwc,t1_fp8c0rv,1588390551.0,I didn’t know that. I just was going to force myself to finish the best I can because school ends in 12 days and then I’m going to graduate.

My anti-psychotics help me sleep but I still wake up 3/4 times every night. And if I do happen to fall asleep before taking my meds, I will be up all night until they kick in. When I’m depressed, I sleep all day all night. I don’t get up I just lay there and sleep. I’m uninterested in a lot of shit and during that time, I can’t get enough sleep.

I started reading all the meditation books, got some crystals (I was obsessed at the time). I meditate but I’m not a “heavy” into it right now. I thought it was helpful before a long day or after a long day. Just some time to myself. Every blue moon my mind will uncover some forgotten memory and “show” me things while I meditate. It’s usually some memory that I don’t want to face or something that really changed my life. (PTSD memories) but I usually tell myself if this is what my brain is showing me then I need to face it. I was told that means “my mind isn’t clear or focused” but I feel like it’s my mind is driving me in that direction for a reason, so I go with it. So eh. I’d try it out if I was you it may be beneficial."

I’d rather go up on my meds than hear them. I’ve considered a 72 hr hold, but I just sit with my feelings until my episode passes. This self-quarantine doesn’t help either. I can’t sit still.

I fall asleep eating it, and wake up with crumbs n shit all over the bed. There was a time I was waking up every night to eat a certain piece of candy from the kitchen. I would wander in the kitchen to eat a piece of candy and go to sleep. I didn’t remember eating it but I remember waking up every morning with the taste of orange in my mouth. I tend to sleep talk too when I’m in between sleep and being awake. Sometimes I will fall asleep in the middle of something. Sometimes I get faint and I have to lay down as well. Seroquel is wonderful for my sleep, but sometimes weird shit happens. When seroquel stops “working” normally that’s when I start having problems with my sleep. That means I either missed my meds or I’m hella hypomanic."

I understand how stressful school can be man. I felt I put a lot of pressure on myself in college to achieve high grades and that really took a toll on me. 

 I felt there was absolutely no stability during that time with my mental health and I was really just a wreck. If you feel like you need to take a break maybe you should. I just let myself go crazy and off the rails for a few months. I just counted down the months. I told myself I was “only” going to be like this for 3 months or 4 weeks until school ended and then I’d work on getting stable again. It kind of worked. I realized when school was over the amount of “stress” I experienced lessened because I knew it was over and I had passed or whatever. I think the classes I didn’t pass had me more stressed because I’ve had to take a class again. I didn’t have the money to do that so I dropped out and came back when I had it.  Take it easy on yourself. Your almost there!!"

Sims4,fohqph5,t3_g7izpg,1587770805.0,Sim logic.
Sims4,fo8w35i,t1_fo7ybxl,1587605058.0,Thanks I’m definitely going to give this a read.
bipolar,fo61u5k,t3_g5ur8y,1587543354.0,"I can relate to everything your feeling. It’s late where I am, and I feel I am fully awake. I think I could do “ day time activities” every night if my anti psychotic didn’t work it’s magic and have me sleep throughout the night. I also feel extremely restless at night and I tend to go in and out of the house. I usually go outside just to get away from that itchy got to do something feeling. It makes me feel tense like ima jump out of my seat or something. I wonder if that could also be ADHD because I have the attention span of a squirrel and my rational brain goes “offline” during my episodes.  My depression tends to worsen at night when I’m alone and stuck with my thoughts. Excess energy that pisses me off over time. Your definitely not alone."
BipolarReddit,fo61b4g,t3_g5w6q4,1587542801.0,"I’m the same way. I think I used meditation as a way of counteracting the hypomania I felt. I felt meditation would benefit me (and it did). I read every book and I bought all the crystals too. Now I hardly meditate everyday but when I have a bad day or I’m a bit tense, I tend to meditate. It seems to calm me down. Only you know when your really stable. I find not every random idea is a result of me being bipolar. Sometimes I’m just really excited about things l see and experience through life. I don’t feel the need to act like I’m stable if I am, because I know am. I tend to just laugh at my friends and family during that time because there really is nothing wrong. Hopefully your friends and family see that you are stable without the need to have to act like it."
BipolarReddit,fo4rljx,t1_fo4mci3,1587509863.0,Yea I’ve used daylio before to track my moods. It’s usually when I get “stable” or become hypomanic and forget to respond because I always do things tomorrow.   I suck at finding my triggers because time moves too fast for me. I’m more consistent with my journaling because I usually get a itch for that. I’m usually dishonest with my therapist and I think I’m probably more manic than hypo if anything.
BipolarReddit,fo4m2j0,t1_fo3xf7v,1587506885.0,Yea definitely nerve wracking to be on the right path and then bam it’s back. I hate backsliding because you don’t even realize your in a episode because they feel so normal. It’s what I’ve been for years. I hope they last longer and longer because right now it’s just a rollercoaster.
BipolarReddit,fo4ltll,t1_fo3s8tb,1587506753.0,Yea I wish my episodes were easy to spot. My episodes are so sneaky and it’s hard for me to know when I’m in a episode or not. My stability can turn into hypomania if  I’m not careful. I think “lamictal” does a semi good job of keeping my depression away and seroquel does fantastic at sucking the life out my hypomania. That’s good that you are able to notice the symptoms before they get out of control. I hope I can get there. I’ve tried to even track it. One of these days I’ll get it.
BipolarReddit,fo3qf2r,t1_fo3ns2d,1587491255.0,"Lucky you man. I wish I understood my rhythm. I’ve been diagnosed for a year but my episodes are so sneaky. So it’s hard for me to really “understand” when I’m in either episode. The longest time I’ve ever been stable at one time is probably 2-3 weeks. I tend to “slide” into my episodes and only really realize I’m in trouble after I’ve full invested my time, energy and money into some fuckery. So frustrating."
bipolar,fo3ny5u,t3_g5j96a,1587490069.0,"Happy birthday giiirl.<3 I can relate to thinking I could have done so much by now. But i did what I wanted to do and I enjoyed it. Every minute of it. And I have no regrets. Things could have been better, but I think my life wasn’t designed for the shit I wish I could have done. I think I’m exactly where I am and where I should be. Be kind and gentle on yourself, and praise your successes not your failures. Stability for me is fleeting, but I continue to chase it. Take care and enjoy the whole day."
bipolar,fo3ggvz,t3_g5i3da,1587486493.0,You should see my daylio app. I have a lot of mood swings as well. Keep your head up. There’s a possibility it could be managed.
BipolarReddit,fo1bnra,t3_g54tby,1587429802.0,Man. I understand this completely. My beautiful energy turns into rage and anybody can get it. Shit.
bipolar,fnw5vzv,t3_g3uxog,1587312061.0,"This happens to me when I lose “touch” with reality and end up stuck in my head like I live there. Your def not the only one. I can clearly see and understand how “full” of thoughts your brain is. My anti-psychotics on a good day will wipe out all of those thoughts, but not all the time. You should reach out to someone who cares about you and will listen. Please take care. Stay safe."
bipolar,fnw4rmk,t3_g3uyqn,1587311420.0,"When I first started taking lamictal, it made me more emotional. I started to cry at everything it was weird having “normal emotions”. My depression is bad as well, but overtime it helped to lighten the “frequency” of depression I experience. For me I don’t think meds work too much to lift my depression. It takes a mix of CBT/DBT tricks,meds,journaling, crying and having someone listen to me. Lately I haven’t been “depressed” for weeks. (last time I was like this it was from oct-dec during this time I contemplated suicide and starting self-harming). It takes a lot more than meds to bring me out of that. Overall, It’s slight sadness that comes and go. I’m taking 100 mgs of lamictal and 300 mgs of seroquel. Because I’m “young and healthy” my psychiatrist prescribed me low doses of meds and expects me to use all of the “tricks” I learned in therapy.

Here are 5 tips I use for depression.

1. Go workout
2. Sleep on schedule (sleep 8-9 hours)
3. Journal/mood diary —> (Daylio is a good app)
4. Attend therapy once a week
5. Research tips for depression on my own(be proactive) 

When all else fails, call your psychiatrist. Be patient with your meds it’ll take time to find the right dosage. Take care and stay safe"
BipolarReddit,fnw2x98,t3_g3vraf,1587310350.0,"I gained 30 pounds on my meds. I been trying to lose the weight but it’s hard because I can never stop eating. I went to the gym everyday for 2 months ate healthy and nothing. I like my anti-psychotics but it’s difficult to deal with the weight gain. I feel it takes a toll on my self-esteem, but the anti-psychotic and mood stabilizer won’t let me feel sad about it all. I told myself I’d work on it. So I guess your post is inspiring me to workout. Be patient with yourself, this is one of those long ass journeys."
BipolarReddit,fntexoo,t1_fnt3xp4,1587240288.0,"My SO is extremely supportive it’s just we differ socially. I’m more outgoing and loud (part of it is bipolar) and he’s more reserved and quiet. So certain things I’m comfortable with, is doing too much for him. It’s frustrating sometimes though. 

Til this day I still find it’s still difficult to “see” what my triggers are and to “know” what mental state I’m in. Usually things happen so fast for me, that when I’m hypomanic it takes “weeks” before I’m actually like wait I been hypo this whole time. There is this window of clarity for me where “stable me” cries for help in between my episodes and I either take my meds and listen or keep going at the shitty rate I’m going. 

For me it never got easier. It is just something that is going to take me years to understand completely. Because when my mind goes “off grid” during these episodes it’s gone. And when my “sanity” comes back I either catch it or I miss it like the bus.

I am blessed to be “bipolar” and functional, in which I can hold a job down, pay my bills on time, and go finish college. 

But when I’m bipolar and depressive dysfunctional, I will miss classes, hw assignments, isolate myself, contemplate ending it all and call in sick to work. 

When I’m bipolar and hypomanic(still dysfunctional) I will start a million projects(finish none of them), probably protest something dumb, drink, smoke, drive fast, play my music loud, be promiscuous(only with my SO now), start some problems, still miss hw/classes (because I’m bipolar and my delusions tell me I’m too “smart” for that, I don’t need to do that).

Somehow my hypomanic episodes got me through college. It was difficult as hell, but I think my hypomania saw college as some sort of challenge. Being bipolar is tough, and I would say it’s far from easy. I think the easiest part is being undiagnosed and living life. I think living life carefully and monitoring your every move is hard. I’m learning everyday though, that it’s a battle and there is always tomorrow."
BipolarReddit,fnt1jor,t1_fnsx11z,1587232840.0,"Man that’s a tough situation. I’m so sorry you are in that situation. That sucks that you have to keep that a secret from my best friend but that does make sense because there’s a possibility you can lose your friend forever. One of my close friends left like that and told me my issues were too much for her. So we aren’t as close as we used to be. She still hits me from time to time but it’s not the same. I wonder why he thinks you’ll ruin their marriage, he’s probably jealous or something about your friendship with your BF and wants your BF all to himself. I wonder if she would keep your diagnosis a secret. But honestly sometimes it’s better not said than said."
BipolarReddit,fnt0yu4,t1_fnsnlot,1587232533.0,"I feel the same way. I actually have a voice that people listen too and it’s a good feeling. I feel the same way, that I don’t owe an explanation to anyone but it’s like you want to share it at the same time. Like a new discovery but you don’t because they won’t get it."
BipolarReddit,fnt0j1a,t1_fnsrvlk,1587232300.0,I do as well. No one knows about it. Not even my close friends. I think it’s better that way honestly for now.  Some of my friends know I’m bipolar but many of them don’t. Sometimes I wish I could tell them though.
BipolarReddit,fnt0cwu,t1_fnsnk1j,1587232211.0,"My SO probably doesn’t even know about reddit to be honest. I almost got caught once trying to respond to a comment. I told my SO it was some sort of forum nothing big. 

I think about being honest and just being like hey I have this reddit and I’d like to show you the things I wrote. But the things I write on here tend to be similar to the things I write in my journal that I don’t share either. I think when my reddit page grows and I actually have “something” to show my SO that it actually helped someone, he may not say anything at all and may get it.   Maybe I’ll say something after a year or 6 months. 

That’s crazy how we would LOVE to share EVERYTHING with them, and are afraid to share SO MUCH with them."
BipolarReddit,fnszhby,t1_fnsxueb,1587231738.0,"My SO isn’t into blogging or stuff like that. My SO is private just like I’m private and would be upset to know that I was out here “on the internet communicating with strangers about my problems”. I felt my anonymity on reddit would help others who may be experiencing the same thing. I wish I would have found this community earlier on in my diagnosis because it has helped so much. I have learned a lot about me and my diagnosis and how it affected so many other people and I felt my giving back was me sharing my thoughts. I think if I was just “browsing” reddit it would be fine, but now that I’m “involved” with the community, it’s different. He would probably flip, if he saw some of my posts. 

I think maybe when my reddit page grows and i am able to show my SO the “tiny difference” that I’m trying to make by sharing my blogs/postings, maybe just maybe, they may come around."
BipolarReddit,fnsybfb,t1_fnstc5u,1587231111.0,I wish I felt that way. I think I am too honest on here with my blogs and I’m sure it would shock everyone in my normal life. My SO and I are aware of my diagnosis and we make adjustments as necessary.  However my SO wouldn’t understand my need to express myself honestly to “strangers” on the internet and probably would probably make me delete it. I like to think my that some of my blogs(postings) are raw and honest and it’s scary opening up your pure subconscious to individuals who only know your conscious thoughts.
BipolarReddit,fnsw81z,t1_fnsng91,1587229976.0,"Man. I want to share my blogs with my SO and sometimes I want to share a passage or two from my journal, but I know it would be too much. There are a lot of things I don’t share that I have shared on reddit with the bipolar community. I agree, it’s hard to really express what I write on reddit. Because it’s like I’m opening up and saying things I don’t say in real life. I do wish it was so easy to just share your reddit, but I feel my SO would make me delete it unfortunately."
BipolarReddit,fnsvtko,t1_fnsjqro,1587229760.0,"I feel better I’m not the only one. There are some things i post that my SO wouldn’t understand at all. And it’s not like it’s bad, it’s just my SO is not bipolar and wouldn’t understand the need for me to blog my feelings."
BipolarReddit,fnnjrt1,t1_fnngc1c,1587094012.0,My SO thinks all of my spending is unnecessary. Basically all of my close friends are reckless money spending harpies. They are not good for my hypomania at all.

I bought a violin with the intention I was going to learn, watched every YouTube video, learned one song and now I’m back to watching Netflix. Ridiculous. I buy it on stupid stuff, weed mostly, whatever I feel is important at the moment. I’m pretty much prepared for any incident in life. I need to be better with skin care. Atleast your heart was in the right place."
BipolarReddit,fnnis39,t1_fnnfekl,1587093338.0,"Wow my spending is out of control. I transfer over hundreds. It’s so freaking frustrating.

Or on expensive food."

I find it from time to time like wow me from the past left this for me in the future. Obsessively researching this item for two days (up all night and day), becoming a master in all there is to know and buying bullshit. I tend to stop when they charge me that transferring fee. It’s almost like a “your doing too much”. So I tend to transfer over money in greater amounts. (Even more dumb). Thanks. I’m trying I’m trying to master this money shit as well."
BipolarReddit,fnnhid3,t1_fnmf7ec,1587092495.0,"I love this. My psych has me run my purchases through my SO as well. Sometimes I can get away with little stuff like that with my SO, but I tend to still buy stuff on my own. Once my SO finds out he’ll make me take it back. I just lost my job a little over a month ago, so I’ve saved some money and have some checks I havent deposited yet. This new stimulus check reminded I have to deposit these checks I have and I’m nervous because it’s a lot of money for me. I’m saving my money until I get a new a job and it’s been tough. Baking is cheap so I’ve been doing that a lot. 
Goodness I wish I had that kind of will. I’m so careless."
BipolarReddit,fnngsm4,t1_fnn718c,1587092026.0,I’m glad I’m not the only one. I’m supposed to tell my SO what I am buying before I buy it and SO is supposed to “monitor” my excessive spending. It’s has gotten to the point where I should be making more of a dent in my cc bills than I am right now. See the joys of getting new things that are random as hell. Congratulations on starting to save more money too. I hope you get that car soon too. I keep some checks in a old journal with a note that says basically don’t touch. It’s worked so far. I’m waiting til May to deposit the checks. I’m currently unemployed so the money is supposed to last me until I find a new job. So far it’s going good as well. We are on the right track.
BipolarReddit,fnngc1b,t1_fnmo232,1587091721.0,I know. I tried once for a jury duty check and I never got another one after I sent in the old one. It didn’t bother me much because It was like 30 dollars. It takes a while to get a new check reissued as well so I tend to just deposit before the date on the check.

BipolarReddit,fnnfq2h,t1_fnm6qoc,1587091317.0,"I normally just go to a ATM and deposit my checks through it. That way I force myself to actually get up and go. I can be lazy and a trip to the bank can be pushed back a whole week or two. I normally pay all my bills with my credit cards and I just pay those off. Sometimes I can get a bit “spendy” and spend my money recklessly so keeping little money in the bank prevents me from doing some major “spur of the moment” damage. I love mobile check deposit though, the joy of money from home."
BipolarReddit,fnnf7qr,t1_fnm49k5,1587090984.0,I try. I’m learning a lot of new ones because sometimes the spending can get a bit out of hand.
BipolarReddit,fnnf4oz,t1_fnmdplm,1587090926.0,Yes. Buy everything you don’t need. I told myself to deposit it when my money starts to get low (or before 60 days).

It took me a few years to finish but I will be finishing in May. I had trouble keeping up w/assignments or prioritizing my time properly. My memory was foggy and I had a hard time retaining information. Now that it’s all over, I realize a lot of my stress came from being overwhelmed.
