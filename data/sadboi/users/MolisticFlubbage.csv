It's up to the department's and professor's judgment whether a student is allowed to enroll in a given class, and availability is limited by space, but I imagine that shouldn't be too much of an issue given your background.  I would suggest contacting the relevant departments first, since (based on a similar experience, although not at a UC) attitudes seem to vary greatly.

A lot of the math used in the Physics major at Berkeley is taught in Physics 89, but Math 54 (Linear Algebra & DiffEq) may be substituted in some circumstances, which include having taken its equivalent at another school.  I suspect that much of what remains is introduced as needed in other courses.  You could probably succeed without taking much more in the Math department, but I would definitely recommend looking at the Math 104 -> 185 sequence for analysis.  The Math department specifically mentions the case of high-school students (https://math.berkeley.edu/courses/enrollment/concurrent-enrollment).

With that said, all data should be interpreted in context, and a GAI of 130 is not strictly equivalent to an FSIQ of 130.  They are equally rare by definition, but there are more ways to achieve the FSIQ since it consists of more subtests and taps more abilities.  Some programs employ an FSIQ cutoff because of high demands on cognitive processing or expectations of work output.

However, there are many anecdotes floating around of children with atypical profiles performing as well as their highest index score might suggest.  FWIW, I was tested at 8 and scored a VCI of almost 170 (with extended norms) and a barely-above-average PRI.  I eventually skipped ~6 grades in math and physics, which is not what one might expect given my performance on the nonverbal part of the WISC-IV."

You can get a pretty good idea.  If you have OEs and other characteristics associated with giftedness, there's a higher probability that you are.  It's likely that you have taken at least one test that correlates decently with IQ (e.g. ACT, SAT, MAT, GRE, LSAT), and scoring above the 98th percentile may indicate possible giftedness.  However, these are NOT IQ tests *per se*, and most definitions of giftedness rely on IQ.  If you score in the ""gifted"" range on one of these, you aren't necessarily gifted, just as scoring below the 98th percentile doesn't preclude giftedness.

It is possible to be unevenly gifted and not have an FSIQ in the same range as your LOG.  For example, I scored 164 for verbal ability on the WISC-IV, but much lower for nonverbal ability.  Although there were indications of possible mismeasurement, including later nonverbal performance at the HG level, this sort of profile (or the reverse with PRI >160 and high-average to superior VCI) would still be considered EG/PG by many professionals.  If at least one broad score that's highly *g*-loaded (in other words, mainly measuring thinking ability, such as the VCI, PRI, VECI, EFI, NVI, GAI, and FSIQ on Wechsler tests) is within the 90% CI of your cutoff of choice, there's a reasonable chance of belonging to that LOG.  Beyond that I would recommend looking at achievement, behavior, and more subjective qualities associated with giftedness.  Unfortunately neither the WISC-V nor any of the modern (official) adult tests I am aware of are capable of measuring beyond 160, so distinctions between HG+ individuals are mostly guesswork at this point."

The example of the soldier could also constitute a form of psychological benefit derived from internalized moral principles and the knowledge that his sacrifice would serve those principles.  This same form of validation may exist in any similar circumstance.

The only necessary supposition here is that an action is considered.  If so, then performance of the action implies that on some level the actor intends to follow what he believes to be the *best* course of action.  Such a judgment necessarily attaches different values to different possible actions according to some scheme of assignment, and choosing to maximize value is a form of validation of the scheme.  Since the scheme itself was chosen upon consideration, validation of the scheme amounts to validation of this choice, and thus serves the self as actuator of the choice.

The interests of mine that I would characterize in this manner are distinguished by the time committed to their pursuit and zeal with which they are pursued.  As a kid this meant paleontology, literature, marine biology, chemistry, and astrophysics.  My current (and longstanding) interests in math and physics have turned into a career path, which may be an advantage of having such intense focus."

antinatalism,ewniypd,t3_cp4t09,1565579599.0,"My childhood.  Rejection, humiliation, deceit, and torture.  I was inconvenient to some people because I didn't fit neatly into a box, so my life was made a living hell.  I spent so much time wondering what was wrong with me.  When I learned about my Asperger's, I thought that must have been all.  Yet I still felt a profound sense of dissatisfaction and ennui.  Only recently did I learn that I'm ""twice-exceptional"" and that my verbal intelligence at age 8 would have been considered superior in an adult.  My teachers ignored this and hoped my giftedness and ASD would both go away.  My agemates have always hated me, which isn't surprising given how fucking weird my cognitive profile and personality are.

As I've grown older and more knowledgeable, I've realized how pathetic humans are.  We are treacherous, judgmental, hypocritical, duplicitous shitbags acting only for personal gain.  At this point I just want the nightmare to end."
misanthropy,ewnh9h9,t3_cp00v7,1565578176.0,"Because human nature predestines us for self-centeredness and tribalism.  Vengeance follows umbrage follows slight.  We have bathed entire continents in blood merely to demonstrate the superiority of our arbitrarily-demarcated nations.  Our unbridled corporate culture is slowly massacring thousands of our fellow species and transforming the only home we've ever known into a shithole.

We possess, compared to all other known forms of life, tremendous intellectual gifts.  But what do the majority of us use them for?  Toiling for the ephemeral glory of others so that we may satiate our worldly cravings by exchanging imaginary units bestowed with value by our decree.  We chase fame and fortune with little regard for the cost.

The only pieces of eternity any of us can ever touch are the results of scientific inquiry, and yet so few of us care enough to learn them.  Instead many choose to worship specious ""eternal truths"" invented thousands of years ago by Machiavellian men covetous of social control.

We only ever act in self-interest.  ""Altruism"" and ""love"" indirectly benefit us by making us feel good about ourselves.  There is no true altruism, only greed.  With the steady procession of technology, total loss of privacy and forced conformity are inevitable.  I guarantee you that there is a database somewhere containing my school records, scores from every test I've ever taken, everything I've ever posted online, every location I've ever taken my phone, footage from my webcam, audio recorded from all of my internet-connected devices with microphones, facial-recognition-sorted CCTV footage of me, my genealogical records, my medical records, and my financial records. The same probably goes for you.  There are probably several such databases, and some of them are probably willing to sell all of this data to colleges and employers.  If they are incomplete or nonexistent, it won't be long before this changes.  Expect genetic modification to become available to the elites soon, just like underaged girls already have been for years.  Their children may even be raised in secret to avoid divulging the existence of superior beings to the common man.

Even worse, we're hypocrites.  Dare to shatter the illusion of a religious idiot, or that of an SJW, and you face ostracism and social censure.  Most of PC culture is due to the desire for moral superiority rather than genuine concern.

Our legal systems are still Hammurabian.  Crime is neither a transformative act nor a revelation of inner evil.  Every human likely could be driven to transgression by some situation, but our laws often fail to account for the relativity of morality.  We even have the gall to execute other humans.  What gives us the right to terminate the life of another if we dislike his actions?  Why punish rather than rehabilitate and protect?

Although I despise human nature and humanity in the abstract, there are many individuals with whom I interact on a regular basis and whose company I enjoy.  However, if I were provided with a switch that would immediately eradicate all of humanity, I would flip it."
