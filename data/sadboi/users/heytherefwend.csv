TalesFromTheCustomer,fn8i80z,t3_g07kyv,1586742239.0,"I drove for an app delivery company that screwed me over as a driver. I was picking up a $60 order at a burrito place. I drove there to be told that they don’t use the delivery service that I was working for because they had been screwed over by them before. I had to wait an hour and a half from the time I drove there for “customer service” to cancel the order so that I could continue working. I was told later that night that they were keeping the money I should have made (even fro driving out). Their policy no longer pays their drivers for “canceled order”. A few strongly worded, yet professional emails later and I was sent 3 “copy/paste” (go fuck yourself) emails back. I’m pretty sure that’s illegal to have someone on your “clock” for that long and deny them any pay for a mistake of the company. No longer working for them.
Then just last night I ordered Chinese from a place (I didn’t realize at first) was less than 5 mins away. Driver was there for about 20 minutes before I literally watched him drive by my house to an area about 10 mins away. He slowly drove around this neighborhood for about 30 mins before finally delivering my food, cold and missing a couple items. He also rang the doorbell, waking up everyone else in the house. It’s pretty easy to read on the app to call/text when here and leave the bag at the front door. Luckily the company refunded me for the missing items + some money for the cold food. 
I love the idea of these delivery apps, they’ve come in great use for some folks during these rough times but man I’ve seen/heard of some bad experiences with them. It’s a shame when your relying on a meal that your paying 10x as much for than groceries to be delivered cold/missing things...
