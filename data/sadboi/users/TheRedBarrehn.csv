But then again, all we have to go on is our own perception of our own experiences on a subjective matter so your platform is as credible as can be. If that's the case, I'll weigh in and go with a 60% bad 40% good spread. I'm an extremely pessimistic person, but I'm aware of my delusions and can impose over them. There are a lot of reasons why people present themselves poorly in the regard of others. Extenuating circumstances unrelated to disposition whether it be familial strife, economic hardship, social ostracism, etc. This is conversely true of those who are evaluating. Those who are undergoing traumatic experiences similarly will equally be unable to perceive others correctly, nitpicking every little countenance, gesticulation, and word choice, conflating them with hostility or apathy or whatever. People blow everything out of proportion on both sides. But the reasoning for my spread is that, in my experience, I've witnessed time and time again people manipulating others, putting them down repeatedly, faking sympathy, etc. But I'm aware of my illness. That's why I turn the notch down a bit, but I personally can't bring myself to say that it's neutral or overall positive. Who's to say really"

No one in college is going to test if you truly are interested in boats or whatever. Just go and hopefully figure out what it is that moves you.
