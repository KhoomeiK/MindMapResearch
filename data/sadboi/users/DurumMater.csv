Kenneth had a daughter who in the 90's and early 2000's had a series of Christan family fantasy kids movies titled ""Commander Kelly and The Super Kids"" my mom used to make us watch it all the time when I was growing up. They're really fucking weird.

And honestly, a lot of Christianity and religion in general deals in faith, or as I like to call it, fancy ignorance. Accepting that things are beyond us so you just need to ""let go and let God"" it's honestly a combination of wanting something to fall back on when times get tough and tricking yourself into fully believing it.
