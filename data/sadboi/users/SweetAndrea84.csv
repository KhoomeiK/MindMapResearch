mentalhealth,fgv636d,t3_f0ihxb,1581138229.0,I’ve had a few meltdowns that began with me laughing uncontrollably. It was the weirdest feeling and yeah I felt insane. I could not control my emotions (stop laughing) no matter how hard I tried. The laughing eventually turned to crying in my case.

glutenfree,ewhiavf,t3_coambn,1565408960.0,Same! I was diagnosed with gluten intolerance this year. My symptoms sound a lot like yours. I’m so sensitive I react to the smallest bits of gluten. It sucks.

AskReddit,ew5a9jy,t3_cmp2tv,1565131409.0,Nursing school! *fingers crossed* it’s something I’ve always wanted to do but my anxiety/doubts stopped me. I came to a realization recently that I’ve let anxiety run my life long enough. First step is to upgrade some of my high school classes :)

wholesomememes,eroe0le,t3_c2wraa,1561076468.0,"This is so sweet.

My grandad has dementia (he just turned 91). He has forgotten about my grandma dying (she died in 2012). He even thought my dad and uncle had hidden it from him. They told him the truth. He has good and bad periods, where he remembers and then he’ll have a bad day/week where he forgets. I don’t think he remembers my aunt (his daughter) passing away. My dad and uncle don’t remind him about that."

AskReddit,ep37crz,t3_btmejf,1559018945.0,"Beautiful Creatures - Barely followed the book and the casting, particularly of Ridley was horrible. Good actress, just not right for the part. 

The Mortal Instruments - Giving them all British accents, making Valentine a young guy, that horrible dubbing of Magnus’ voice.

Vampire Academy - Again ignoring the book. It’s been so long since I’ve seen it lol I just remember how disappointing it was.

Divergent- First movie did a good job (I thought). Then the second and third ones were horrible."
