depression,fagk0w3,t1_fagjvjy,1576059218.0,Yeah she acts like she understands but gets mad and confused when I can't do things I don't like saying I'm depressed as a crutch so I don't but that's hoe it is I feel like she dosen't fully get the severity or full understanding of things and she tries being cool about it and nice i guess but even when we talk to my therapist it comes little weird and I dont know if insensitive is the right word I held back tears when she laughed a little over something she down plays the severity off
