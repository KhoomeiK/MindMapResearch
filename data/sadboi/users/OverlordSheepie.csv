The Pristiq helps with my depression and the Zyprexa helps for my schizophrenia.  I was prescribed Vyvanse to help with the hunger cravings I got from my Zyprexa because I gained around 30 lbs on it.  It’s really effective and I lost 40 lbs on it.  The Vyvanse also counteracts the sedating effects of the Zyprexa. If I don’t take a Vyvanse I’ll sleep all day.

The combination of these drugs seem to help me the most.  I’m especially grateful to be on the Vyvanse, without it I’d be a walking zombie.  Hopefully I won’t get pulled off it in the future by disapproving doctors."

Everyone seems to know my name, I sometimes wonder if that’s because it’s uncommon to see an Asian at my school.  My school is mostly made up of black, white, and Hispanic/Latino students.  We celebrate Black History month and sometimes Hispanic/Latino history month, but it’s hard because that’s September, just when school starts.  Asian and Pacific Islander history month isn’t celebrated, and it would be hard to if it was because it’s during May, that’s when finals are.  We have a Korean Culture club but I’ve never been.

I was fairly civil and I think you’re taking this the wrong way.

Yes, perhaps I could’ve handled it better or not have said anything, but I commented because I didn’t think that what they were saying was true.  I’ll try and empathize better then."

Sure, maybe I invaded their safe space, but it’s a public forum and I think I have a right to be there just like everybody else.  I don’t get why calling out racist comments is, as an Asian, ‘correcting’ them.  You make it sound like I was trying to exert power and oppress then, I was just informing them that what they were saying wasn’t exactly true.  If they’re going to target Asians then they should expect some understandable backlash."
asianamerican,fhb49pt,t1_fhaouhe,1581434455.0,"I only commented because what they were saying was factually incorrect.

I usually don’t talk about Asian issues when people talk about black issues, but if they’re going to be making assumptions about Asians I’m for sure going to call them out for it.

There has been people on this sub calling out Asians for being anti-black, so I don’t see why it’s different for an Asian to call out a black person for being anti-Asian.  I think we should be considerate and understanding but I think discourse on the topic is important."
asianamerican,fhaz8p1,t1_fhatu6d,1581431038.0,"I agree we need to call out anti-blackness in the Asian community, it’s definitely a problem.  I believe it’s a two-way street, however, the black community should call out anti-Asianness in their circle as well.  I think it’s working though, this sub is pretty accepting and supportive of the black community, at least from what I’ve read.

Hopefully we can all unite against mutual oppression like you said.  I think it’s important for everyone to be aware of each other’s struggles."
