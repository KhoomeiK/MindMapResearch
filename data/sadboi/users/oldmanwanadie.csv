You caught my attention, since I have similar ways and background to what you mentioned. Feelings of not belonging anywhere have been so familiar to me, so often throughout my life, very regrettably. I have also felt undeserving of any importance, considering others as the better recipients of anything favorable coming around, since being so much more well suited to having favorable circumstances happen than I would. I think this type of disposition comes from being bullied in Junior High, seemingly with the universe showing me my unworthiness to even exist. Even though learning later that secrets keep me sick, I started maintaining a facade to cover my inner turmoil, because of this, keeping it nicely hidden. This all helped fester depression and anxiety about the future, I feel, leading to suicidal ideation as a everyday way of being for me, most all of the time. With you feeling suicidal but not knowing how at this point, might be a saving grace, since it slows things down enough for you to consider whether you’ve checked out all possible alternative scenarios that might have a possibility of making things a little easier for you. I have grappled with suicide in this manner, along with having procrastination and doing things very slowly, at the top of my values list, which is probably why I’m still here, still suffering, more than not."

It was when I was 12, that I recall coming out of my last vivid one, during a nice sunny day in my classroom, just before the tormenting bullying started for me, that stopped it all. I think it’s most fortunate you are still capable of doing daydreaming at 19. I’ve most always have had a very difficult time with my experience of life, particularly interacting with others, causing much anxiety and depression. When I stopped drinking in my late twenties, I learned about pretending as a useful tool in doing things that are very risky and scary for me that’d most likely result in me being so coldly rejected. Of course, having a good support system made this new behavior easier to do, which I’m most grateful for having at that time. These days, though, I’m less concerned about goals, as when I was younger, which caused much concern and worry about the future, for me.

I always thought detachment was the best, as I’ve mentioned to others, many times, over, in the past. Supposedly, according to some Buddhist, with the cessation of craving, grasping and clinging, life becomes magical.

Expectations, no matter what or from who, have always led to my darkest and gloomiest times, always.

I’ve just read recently, though, that isolation is a survival technique when being depressed, since being ostracized and shunned by others is avoided, with them not having the possibility of observing and making judgments. This has been a underlying theme throughout my life, with its most impact on me, recently, with nearly 4 years now, since going out and about. My dad was the same way, so it might be in my genes, according to my family, at least, who shame me about it. When I was younger, I used alcohol and drugs to handle my depression and social anxiety, which made a bigger mess of everything in the long run, so regrettably. Now I avoid others at all costs, even just going to the mailbox, I need to be ever on the lookout. This, I imagine, is all good and well for someone like me who is old and almost at the end of life.

No matter what, he’d keep repeating, “Om mani pondme’ hum” over and over, in his head, thoughout the day, even while having a conversation with another person. So I did this, too, and it helped a lot, almost immediately. Also, I believe at this age or so, 27 to 30, everyone go’s through a testing period of many challenges, coming out of it with a new type of emotional maturity, even though it can be more painful with some than others, contingent on the different makeup of each, being more burdensome, if it’s such a handicap as a nonstop inner dialogue, that exists, as we have."

You might just become ill and sluggish, is all. When I was in my 20’s I took a whole bottle of sleeping pills, using the last of my money to purchase, waking up after a couple hours feeling awkwardly disoriented and puzzled why after saying all my goodbyes to everyone in my head, that I’m still here. It seemed like a very big gyp to me, as well as making me feel very dumb.

Even having a slip and getting drunk, it was painful and hard, with me being a dismal failure at it, very pathetically. So I thought easing into it would be best, eventually ending up using small nooses to redirect my attention from my intense emotions, caused from interpreting how bad I was. I would put on up to a dozen or so, nooses, tightening each one in turn, while sitting on my meditation pad, doing my serene reflection meditation. I was hoping to be too late when loosening the ropes, but it seems I became most cognitive just before I thought I might pass out, so as to make a easy accidental exit very difficult. I did this so often over a period of 2 years that I got quite use to the pain of my head feeling like it will explode, becoming a very welcome place compared to dealing with my guilt and shame that tormented me so, almost always. Anyway, getting caught by the police, who took all my nooses away, bringing me to the hospital, too, put a stop to this practice, until hearing about Robin Williams and others, this last decade, with me rethinking it as a worthwhile technique, again."

Meditation,fojz3ea,t3_g7o41n,1587832283.0,"Very insightful, your description of attachment and what it does. This is why I gave up trying to be a success as a artist, decades ago. I noticed then that my desires to create a favorable environment for this were causing many difficulties with my relationships. Still, since then, l’ve always automatically replaced goals with other goals, having not much luck in stopping it, even if thinking by setting a goal of meditating 2 to 3 hours a day is somehow exempt from any detrimental desire, and won’t bring any problems to my situation, only to find me lacking understanding, so regrettably, again. I was reminded, while reading what you wrote, of my stay at Shasta Abbey a long time ago, when we ended our last sitting of the day reciting a few things from the Buddha, with the  “ goal of goallessness “ as the most memorable standout then and still is, now, for me. Thank you so much for the different train of thought that you brought about and is happening in my consciousness at this moment."

Also, I’m terribly sorry for your anxiety about possibly becoming abusive and manipulative in a future relationship, as you feel you might. Hopefully this will not come to pass for you, since from personal experience, it has always been a great source of pain and self degradation for me, that I would not wish on any other, when I’m being at my most thoughtful. I believe that I might have a similar trait as you with experiencing myself as the “bad person”, also. This most overwhelming of all feelings, happening on a regular basis throughout my life, contributed so much to causing my many downtrodden states, such as I am in at this dismal period of my life, so sadly. Way too many times I’ve wanted to be a better version of myself but felt defected so, to be beyond repair, like you, as well, only in my case, to make it all worse than before, by taking actions I felt would remedy it, only to have the reverse effects, happen, so regrettably. Even finally becoming somewhat of a adult when I was 28, resulting from coming to terms with my drinking and being gay, could only stem off this self abusive way of perceiving things for so long, coming back more and more often to the all too familiar shame base conditioning I’ve grown use to and had since the start of life. I still blame my parents for a lot of it, particularly forming the foundation, even though I realize it’s another judgment call of mine that is not 100 percent true, still it doesn’t mean I can stop making it, only less adamant about it, though, it seems. Even at 65, I’m dealing with a lot of changes that are extremely uncomfortable. I’ve heard that change is the same as stress. The basis of this universe, as I see it, is change, which seems to identify it as a universe of stress. For me, it’s never been all that easy here, but still always delaying my departure, because of my many attachments. Some day in the near future, hopefully, they will not be so many and so strong. Hey, I just noticed that, amazingly, this has been very helpful and empowering in a strange way to contemplate and disclose, to you. Thank you so much for bringing all this to my attention ! Hopefully the universe will lighten up and not be so harsh to you, in the near future."

My dog went very abruptly, several months ago, causing me to be in shock for awhile. My cat died a month later, having a more gradual decline, but still quite upsetting. He was very stressed out when he went blind, two months before he died. He was on the floor laying on his back, clawing and hissing at the air, when it first came on and was not able to see. The poor kitty. He had a hard time navigating through the house, afterwards, needing help from me quite often. He still had a very good appetite up to the end, though, when he needed to be carried around, extensively, those last two days. On his last day, I was about to lift him off the cold kitchen floor to be near the fireplace, which he loved, when he gave me the most contented sound, so I left him lie where he seemed to want to be. It was very sad to find him dead, their, the next morning, but not surprising. I’ve felt guilty about my performance with them, during they’re last days, being unprepared as I was, having no transportation to the vets and such.

SuicideWatch,fhid0o0,t3_f3dhbw,1581622357.0,"When I was in the locked up ward of our hospital, I discovered a friend, newly arrived, one afternoon. He was strapped to his bed which sat in the hall next to the nurses station amid the bright lights and noisy traffic. He only responded to me, with how he needed to kill himself so urgently with no alternative choice possible. I told him, I was once in his position, strapped next to the nurses station for a couple of days, having a very miserable time until I finally told them I’ll postpone any attempts until after I leave the hospital. I was then able to be in one of the bedrooms with just 15 minute checks on me instead of the constant observation next to the nurses station. I told my friend that all he needs to do is do what I did, telling them his suicidal urges have subsided and he’ll be placed in a bedroom with more peace and quiet, where better sleep and rest is possible. He didn’t go for any of that and stayed very adamant, with such a determination and focused attention of killing himself, without anything else having any possibility of being deemed important enough to detract from his tunnel vision of the importance of imminent death. He was still their, strapped, next to the nurses station a few days later when I was discharged and finally killing himself, several days later on, which was all very heartbreaking to me. Many years after now, I’m realizing, for me to follow through successfully with any attempt I have planned, I will need to have a very similar determination and focused tunnel vision as Eddy had all those years ago. In essence, focusing entirely on death, for several days, possibly, while renouncing anything this world might be able to offer in relieving my pain, as well as coming to the conclusion that any past pleasures, both sensual and emotional, were just tricks conjured up by this universe towards my vulnerable and delusional self, to coerce me into considering, existence here, worthwhile."

AstrologyChartShare,ff3tqy3,t3_er7v5o,1579548663.0,"Hello, the first noticeable impression I have of your chart is the planetary pattern it displays, with most of your planets below the horizon, designating a more introverted personality. Also, your Moon is very significant, being alone at the top and the highest planet in your chart, making it the handle of the bucket pattern, of your planets, designating it a apex point, where the energy of your more familiar part of your life is brought out, to be noticed and appreciated, most notably, with your feeling and instinctive nature finding expression through some form of emotional attachment to social, ethical or religious values. You have a inherent need to expand your life, by way of travel, study, philosophy and the search for metaphysical truths. With having a Virgo Moon trine Saturn, also, this tends to give you less emotional display, while still being very concerned and caring when it comes to the welfare of others. You are very observant, carful, attentive and above all responsible, always responding competently, with a thoughtful, conservative, prudent and sober attitude to affairs. You are, in fact quite loving, even though others may feel overly scrutinized or inadequate, in your presence, at times. You have the capacity for organization and can hold very responsible positions in life, accomplishing most by subtlety, tact and method rather than by force. As life progresses, you will attain steady advancement of responsibilities and trust, through your persistence and hard efforts. While being shy and reserved, having difficulties expressing your true feelings, you will obtain much respect, credit and social esteem that you duly deserve."

You have your closest aspect here, also, with 6 minutes of separation from exact with your Jupiter conjunct Pluto, endowing you with immense ambition and determination to change existing conditions to the betterment of yourself and society. Being a stellium, once one of these planets is effected by a transit or progression than all of them, are vibrating the same type of influence, such as will happen during this coming Friday’s new Moon at 4 degrees Aquarius in your 10th house of career, sextile your natal Mercury at 4 degrees Sagittarius, which will effectively sextile your whole stellium from your Pluto to your Sun, making your mind quite sharp, with any research you may have had, happening at this time, bringing much rewards. This will be a couple of weeks of feeling in harmony with others while your self expression flows quite easily, with you feeling especially hopeful, tolerant and generous, with tremendous energy and drive to accomplish a multitude of things. At the same time, transit Jupiter conjunction to your Mid Heaven will bring a high water mark to your career aspirations and social recognitions by giving you a fortunate change of circumstances in your work and career,  you’ll possibly receive a promotion, job offer, large contract or salary increase. This new Moon transit will highlight this, while also keeping the influence going, for a couple of weeks, bringing a culmination at the full Moon. It will generally bring out the secret power of your 8th house stellium, now, with a more potent focus on your higher knowledge, verbal expression, innovation and emotional appeal to others, seeing you as a defender of their home as well as a personal guardian. Your caretaker, guru qualities will come forth, with others seeing your charisma, self confidence and invincibility as a light in the dark, with your most noteworthy ability to transform and embrace impermanence, happening now, as well. Because of your exceptional insights into human psychology, you will be inspiring others to go on a quest of truth and discovery, bringing clarity and expansion to the mystical matters of the 8th house. You could very well become the famous guru or teacher that shares your wisdom and philosophy to the people. In another area of your chart,  Neptune is the highest planet, closest to your Mid Heaven, reinforcing all this, particularly since, being in mutual reception with your Saturn, putting them in each other’s houses and signs as well as being conjunct, letting your imaginative and spiritual potential manifest itself through your chosen social position in the world. You possess a highly inspirational nature, capable of attaining honor or position through some unique achievements. Your professional life could be enclosed in some spiritual framework such as a minister, spiritual teacher or psychiatrist, within, possibly a institutional environment, hospital, prison or asylum. With such overwhelming circumstances coming into your life, at times, it will be easy for you to loose direction, occasionally, when it will be necessary to withdraw and seek seclusion, most likely before a career change, is eminent. With your Vesta at 8 degrees Cancer, in your 3rd house, the way for you to recharge is to clam up and stop communicating for awhile and if you have siblings, stay away from them as well, neighbors, too."
AstrologyChartShare,fekx00t,t1_fej0rh4,1579209343.0,"Hello youngster, for career choice, the first place I usually look is the 10th house of career, with you having Uranus and more importantly, Neptune positioned their, with Neptune stationery, just turned retrograde a couple of days earlier, making it more significant and potent. It is also the highest planet in your chart in a wide conjunction with your Mid Heaven. The most significant characteristic of your Neptune, though, is its mutual reception with your Saturn in Pisces, being in each other’s signs as well as houses, causing a conjunct of the two to manifest in your chart, as well as placing Saturn in your Capricorn, 10th house and your Neptune in your Pisces, 12th house and since no debilitating aspects are effective with them other than a couple minor aspect issues, they are very capable of helpful assistance to each other in working with your endeavors, particularly with 10th and 12th house affairs. You’d be most adapted to any career that deals with a spiritual framework, such as a minister, spiritual teacher or psychiatrist and of doing service for others working in hospitals, prisons and asylums.  On occasion, because of Neptune’s position, you will loose direction in life and will need to withdraw into seclusion before making a change in career. At this time, by happen stance, transit Saturn is conjuncting your natal Neptune, being a time of having difficulties understanding your self, while also being very self critical. This is a unsettling time of letting go of unneeded habits, beliefs and methods, only to make ready for a more favorable scenario for yourself. By coincidence, transit Neptune is conjuncting your natal Saturn , being more effective later this year and all next year, when your problems will loose their definitions and be less difficult. You might have a sense of living in a dream world or being awake in your own dream, when the spirit world will seem more possible and more real. The second place I look is the 2nd house of money, to see where a working income is coming from, with yours being, again the 12th house, with your 2nd house ruler, Venus, residing in your 12th house. Your Venus gives you shyness and social inhibitions, that may lead to some loneliness and romantic frustrations, which is offset, part of the time by your most beneficial trine by your Jupiter in your 8th house, which is a good indication of fortunate events, with love and marriage, social success, gain and general good fortune. Associated with wealth and culture, as well as handling large amounts of money and valuable assets. I have this aspect and even though what I stated, has been true for me, it’s not always on, being off most of the time, it seems, until a transit comes to trigger this aspect. For you, most notably, this weekend and coming week is it, with transit Mars conjunct your natal Jupiter trine your natal Venus, bringing a most auspicious time to go out and seek and acquire a relationship and/or business ventures. Also, your Juno(timer of relationships) at 4 degrees Capricorn was triggered by the 2019 Christmas solar eclipse, giving it a few months duration, to last into March, for you to possibly find your perfect partner, being very practical and who will help you organize your business as well, being from a different background than you, possibly from a different country, as well. At this time, transit Juno is sextile your natal Mars positioned in your 5th house of romance, boding well for something, favorable to start, now. Any type of commitment, probably wouldn’t occur until September, though, when transit Juno enters your 7th house of marriage, with the last half of November most fortuitous, since Juno is joined by the transit Sun, Moon and a advancing Mercury and Venus. Transit Jupiter hits your Mid Heaven this February 19th with the Moon along its side bringing a event that will significantly symbolize a peek and high water mark for your career and recognition from others. You will receive a job offer, promotion, contracts or salary increase, with the whole year going most favorably career wise. The 6th and 12th house polarity might show your special skill set you have for others with Chiron located their, being part of your grand trine with your Moon and Neptune, making you a most inspirational teacher, healer or dietician , if only possible to do for others what you can not do for yourself, so sadly. Since, this is a grand trine, with Neptune and Chiron involved, it may be necessary to kick start it with volunteer work, that leads to career opportunities, because of its static but oh so beneficial nature."

With your North Node here, too, this lifetime’s purpose is to make a complete personality change, with you almost constantly readjusting your values, it would seem, as well as coming across situations that will do this for you. The main lessons your 8th house stellium is suggesting to you, is for you to learn when to take control and when to let go, when to trust others to take control and when to take it your self.  Also, it is most favorable for you to accept your self, and realize you can succeed without you having to be constantly fighting for change, either within yourself or without. Accepting your sexuality, in any way, might be a big issue for you, too, but by doing so, would be so beneficial for your physical and mental health, with bringing the most success in your relationships, most assuredly. Patience and tolerance, also, seems most challenging, with your Mars and Saturn here with your Mars, more so, with such a close to exact opposition with your Pluto, to cause such extreme and intense emotions in you, that you might find difficulties in expressing in a assertive and constructive manner, with others. Your Venus opposite your Pluto is the most exact challenging aspect, you have, with only 5 minutes of separation, making quite a impact for you with such a tempestuous love life to have or possibly some psychological block that hinders this. I noticed, at this time, your progressed Moon is just finishing with conjuncting your Pluto and opposing your stellium, while also triggering your Pluto to Sun and Jupiter Yod, having a very fated result for you, pertaining to partners and career. With your grand trine of Pluto, Moon and Juno, some type of commitment to a valued partner might of happened or about to, soon. Transit Mars is fast coming up to your Pluto now too, with opposing Mercury, this week, you are most likely encountering opposition to your ideas, at this time. Best to not come on to strong or be too impulsive and taking shortcuts will have you remembering the adage “haste makes waste “.  This last week of this month, January, looks to be extremely eventful for you. Please be careful with your whereabouts and the people you associate with at this time, particularly if there’s any underhanded activity afoot. Transit Neptune is squaring your stellium now, too, particularly with your Venus, letting a posible love interest seem more than they are, coming across in some type of romantic illusion, possibly only to mislead you, so sadly. Financial setbacks is another possibility with this square, because of Neptune wanting to dissolve and dissipate, only for the benefit of the wider picture of things, and to the benefit of all. With your Jupiter highest in your chart, emphasizing much ambition and success, it is squaring your hard working Moon in the 6th house, promising many work and career opportunities, for you, which will always be popping up, no matter what, as well. With it sextiling your Sun in your 7th house, it shows with the right type of partner, either business or romantic, you will find the most success possible, for your self. I also have Pluto in my 2nd house of money and possessions, as you do, resulting in windfalls and deprived times, with my hard lesson in life being impermanence. I am always being reminded that everything I have at any particularly time will be eventually taken away and in actuality, I am only renting and borrowing things, even if bought and paid for."
AstrologyChartShare,fdxt09r,t3_en8iro,1578772581.0,"Hello Randy, the first noticeable thing in your chart, is your Scorpio Moon so exact on your Ascendant, possibly within seconds, even though, not easily ascertained, since discrepancies exist in getting the most exact, down to the second birth time. Still, it has quite a impact, letting you show your feelings so easily, with it being a more automatic and subconscious showing of your true self, consisting of immense caring, nurturing and sensitivity with such intensity, since Scorpio is on your Ascendant. Also, with Scorpio on your 12th house cusp and with its ruler, Pluto, in your 1st house in a wide conjunction with your Moon, it brings the agenda of the 12th house, to be expressed in your first house, which causes you to create a image of your self to others as someone who has suffered. Your sorrow is one of the first things people notice about you. This will also bring urges to be helping those who are of need, at the forefront of your thoughts, in doing so, though, be careful about associating with people who don’t have your best interests at heart. Your awareness of the paranormal, interest in other worldly experiences and spiritual outlook will be apparent to others, as well as you having some psychic abilities, needing of development, too. The next notable feature is your closest to exact square, with a personal planet, being your Suns square with your Saturn, with a 35 minute separation from exact, being so very close, with a more 4th house, Cancer type of insecurities, as part of the stressors and challenges that causes such a inferiority complex that blocks creative action, for you. Your Juno (asteroid of marriage) is also tied into this, being so tightly conjunct your Saturn, squaring your Sun, causing ego conflicts with partners, as well as a possible lack of interest in obtaining or denied in getting, any intimate relationship, at all. Please try, in any event, waiting until your about 30 in making any relationship commitment, otherwise there’s a good chance it’ll fall apart. This does go against your ingrained instincts, since you have Venus in your 7th house, having such a Libra, Gemini and Aries(conjunct Mars) influence to your socializing and one on one relationships. You might feel the key to your happiness is a close intimate relationship, with such a tendency to fall in love at first sight, that you have. Even with a magnetic personality as yours(Mars conjunct Venus), you might self sabotage relationships because of your low self esteem (Venus retrograde), possibly being exasperated by feeling guilty, because of over doing some of your emotions in your interactions with others (Jupiter quincunx Venus). With your tightest square of Sun/Saturn in a T-Square configuration, the best way to relieve your stress and tension, letting resistance to morph into acceptance with your challenging aspects here, is to develop the empty leg of your T-Square, which is your 11th house, with Chiron, their, in a very close opposition to your Saturn, causing difficulties with groups and a high sensitivity to criticism. The ruler of your 11th house is Mercury in your 8th house, giving you interest in groups that deal with taboo subjects such as sex and the occult, which would be very rewarding for you to be affiliated with. Focusing on the aspects that Mercury has, will help develop your 11th house, immensely, with the most glaring aspect being its quincunx to your Moon. Along with your investigative nature, your imagination will become a asset once you’re capable of expressing your true feelings, while diminishing any feelings about what might be overlooked meanings in what others communicate to you. It’s better to take things at face value most always, so as to relieve any paranoid type of thinking. Overall, fully articulating your feelings to others is one of the main suggestions your chart is asking of you. In doing so, you will be imbedded in a transformative journey of self discovery and much success and wealth is possible, through favorable business contacts and opportunities, even if lacking any faith in being lucky. (Jupiter in 2nd house)."
AstrologyChartShare,fds4trq,t3_emobfp,1578694374.0,"Hello youngster, you have more planets above the horizon than below, letting you be more of a extrovert than not. Your Moon is in its most comfortable home sign of Cancer and is part of your Grand Trine configuration with your Sun and Mars, making its security issues more serene and well adjusted. Your driving force is your two tightest squares to personal planets, being your Sun and Mars squaring Pluto and Uranus, respectively, can be like a volcano going off and a earthquake happening at times, for you. The Sun Pluto square also involves Juno the asteroid of marriage in a tight conjunction with Pluto at 9 degrees Sagittarius in your 6th house, putting a emphasis on partner and marriage relationships being overshadowed with dominance issues, so regrettably. Also, you might be married to your work and delay marriage quite a bit, or all together. This close square can also cause possessiveness and ruthlessness. If channeled wisely, this energy could manifest a dominant, forthright character, in you, with much executive potential. You must learn how to compromise, though. Your next and very close square between Mars and Uranus, is the earthquake, involving problems with behavior through reckless, impulsive and dangerous actions, tending you to be somewhat erratic and eccentric, enthusiastic and sometimes irritable, inclining you to be over energized and too forceful. This also can cause legal trouble and difficulties with the opposite sex, with most of the events in your life being sudden and unexpected, as they are. Avoid entering into any disputes and guard against putting your self into dangerous situations. Please endeavor to become more calm, less rashly inclined and never become too overly excited, so as to avoid accidents and injuries, particularly with sharp objects and fire. Your Venus, Jupiter and Pallas on your Mid Heaven, being the most fortunate of all your aspects, with it you will become well known for your charming ways, ambitious drive and intelligence in any career you choose."
AstrologyChartShare,fdrif5m,t3_emp2z5,1578684999.0,"Hello, having 6 Capricorn planets in the 9th is a lot of focus on higher learning and travel. I believe Mars is here as well, being pulled in by the others, still influencing your 8th somewhat, but far less. Also, with Saturn being ruler of your 9th, positioned in your 10th in Aquarius, shows where all your studies and travels are being directed, and that’s into career and public recognition. Saturn is also your highest planet in your chart, while being in mutual reception with your Uranus in Capricorn, making a conjunction of the two, with each in each other’s sign and house. So you actually have 7 planets in Capricorn and in your 9th house, instead of just 6, being Saturn added now, too. Uranus is now in your 10th, as well, making it a equally high planet, along with your Saturn, too. This makes you a natural entrepreneur with the possibility of much success and achievement, even though, entailing the most time consuming hardest work on your part, that can be had. Having so much attention and focus on Capricorn and your 9th, might necessitate a need to develop your 3rd house, so as to establish a balance in your life. Your 3rd house ruler is in your 7th house of relationships, with its only major aspects being a close trine to Eris and a wide trine to Ceres, both in your 12th house, letting your Moon seem almost unaspected, to a large degree, possibly, making your emotional nature be a all or nothing phenomenon. With out having any natural release, anchors or blocks, your Moons changeable energy is either hyper sensitive and needy, one moment and then shut down and contained the next, since having no major aspects from the main planets, at all. Along with this, your moon being in Sagittarius, is gifting you to be happy with austerity and in the 7th house, finding your emotional stability in having close intimate relationships and as ruler of your 3rd, needing someone who you can share all your thoughts with, while placing much significance on communication with your partners, in general, might help your vacant 3rd house out quite a bit, balancing your 3rd and 9th house polarity, some. One thing of note is today’s Lunar Eclipse, putting such a major impact on your stellium with many transit planets involved in such a condensed proximity, placing another major stellium on top of yours, as it is, that already exists in your chart, which can only signify something very important, with long ramifications, is happening to you or about to, in the next few months."
AstrologyChartShare,fdp1mrc,t1_fdophby,1578617853.0,"I have my Pluto squaring my retrograde Venus, as well, along with it being in Scorpio, which is ruled by Pluto, making things so much more dire, relationship wise. As far as karma, I believe it came about, partly, by using sex as a manipulative tool, in producing desired needs and wants from other people. This always has a chance of being repeated, particularly being in fixed signs as we have, and so has been played out again by me in this life time, so sadly enough."
AstrologyChartShare,fdorgap,t3_emacid,1578611231.0,"Hello Angelina, as already noted, you have a Mystic Rectangle in your chart, even though the wide orbs are debatable between your Uranus and Jupiter and Pluto. It may be best to consider, though, the tightening effects of your Gemini stellium in your 12th and 1st houses as well as your overlapping T-Square and two Mystic Triangles configurations in how potent this Mystic Rectangle actually is, for you. Your most dynamic configuration is your T-Square, it seems, that pulls your planets tighter into aspects with each other, while causing some of the most tension and most debilitating dispositions for you, as well. Most note worthy, is your Sun square Saturn, being your closest to exact square with a orb of 44 minutes, making it very potent and somewhat overwhelming for your other characteristics, to show through, particularly when being triggered by a transit or progressed planet. Basically this square concerns a possible inferiority complex that might block self expression. A way to relieve such stress for you would be to develop the empty leg of your T-Square which is the 9th and 10th houses of higher learning and career, respectively. The best way to develop these houses is to focus on their house rulers and the energy of their most favorable aspects. For your 10th house it’s ruler, Neptune trines both Jupiter and Saturn in your 12th house, with many ways of using this energy to further your career. One being, sacrificing yourself to a cause that would have you enduring tedious, methodical, painstaking and patient work for the completion of humanitarian projects. With your ruler of your 9th house, Uranus in its own sign, trine your Ascendant Moon conjunction, as well as conjuncting Juno, you’ll be taking a very unconventional way, with possibly, a very unconventional partner as well, who you’d feel most comfortable traveling with and communicating on shared philosophical thoughts. This might help with your other most troublesome close square between your Moon and Venus, making it very difficult to express your true feelings, hampering any love relationships that you wish to develop, so sadly. Even with your progressed Moon going through your 10th house, squaring your natal Jupiter, this winter, might bring loss or denial, things will be improving as the year progresses and into the next, with your progressed Sun conjunction to your natal Venus, bringing most fortunate circumstances for you concerning romantic relationships, peeking in the summer of 2021."
AstrologyChartShare,fdnvqy4,t3_em1wz5,1578593828.0,"Hello Ty, I believe it is most fortunate for you to have such a strong Mystic Rectangle, with most all the orbs below 6 degrees, with the exception of your Moon trine with your Sun, which is less than 8 degrees, being still strong since being the luminaries. This configuration ties into your two T-Squares nicely, helping with the tension their, as well as obtaining some friction and discomfort, from your T-Squares, also, which the Mystic Rectangle lacks, with it being such a soft configuration, as it is. What it obtains from your T-Squares, squares, will bring the motivation to balance your two oppositions of your Mystic Rectangle as well as your extra Jupiter/Saturn opposition, eventually, bringing a extremely strong sense of balance, structure and harmony between your planets that are positioned in the four corners of this configuration. Finding this balance will take conscious effort and awareness by using the energy of your sextiles and trines within this configuration, bringing about a point of integration with the polarities of your planetary oppositions. Once this point of balance is found, it becomes increasingly easy to maintain, bringing a core of strength to you and a solid foundation that will be a great gift for handling whatever life throws at you, such as now, with all that is hovering over your Moon, at this time. Transit Saturn and Pluto conjunction to your Moon, is also vibrating your closest to exact square, now, with your natal Mercury, making the strongest changes to your thought patterns, that are intertwined with such strong emotions that can bring so many feelings of morose and melancholy, so as for you to go through. The eventual outcome of this particular squares transformation, will be of you becoming a most clever, witty and expressive conversationist and in doing so, most likely, signifying a balance is being achieved with your troublesome opposition’s, in your talent filled, Mystic Rectangle and your challenging, T-Squares."

Your natal Pluto, Jupiter and Saturn aspect these three, with various degrees, mostly a mix of five aspects, the Square, Semi Square, Sextile, SemiQuintile and Biseptil. These aspects, as well as all these 6 planets, when triggered by transits and progressed planets, would pull your Pisces planets together a little tighter, as is happening this winter for you. Transit Neptune is about to pull away, slowly but more steadily than not, now, from conjuncting your natal Sun, with your personal sense of reality having been dramatically changed in the last year or so. Your last birthday, when you turned 19, the cosmos put a very significant emphasis on your group of three, with a special Pisces impact, since along with transit Sun conjuncting your natal Sun, transit Moon was conjuncting your natal Moon, with retrograde Mercury right alongside, giving you your natal chart stellium to you again, but only much tighter, this time and making it a pronounced theme for the whole year, since being a solar return and with Neptune involved, bringing their characteristics up a few notches and making them oh so, more noticeable. Before your planetary ruler (Neptune) departs, it’ll be making another noticeable impact this coming March 6, 2020, when you turn twenty, since your progressed Venus will be coming on a exact conjunction  of your natal Sun, flavoring transit Neptune’s conjunction in a most pleasant way possible, with a dream like scenario of, if only for you to be comfortable with yourself and like what you see, the whole world around you will automatically do likewise.

First, though, the little dots from your Moon to your Venus is a Sesquequadrate, a 135 degrees minor square, that has a 15 degrees Virgo type affect(work and health), since it’s separating, resulting in confusion in sorting out conflicting thoughts and feelings, pertaining to others in your life. Eventually, you’ll express both your feelings and the value of others, equally, most notably, in your workplace. Your Moon(feeling and instinctive nature) in your 11th house(group activities), being the highest planet(gentle, protective, nurturing) in your chart, conjunct your North Node(good fortune and popularity), and semi square your MH (effort to be more responsive to others), has a significant impact on your career, it would seem. Also, it conjuncts Chiron(teacher healer), as well as being the engine in your Locomotive pattern your chart displays with your planets. This indicates that relationships and groups are the fuel that drives you with a special focus on the 9th house of foreign cultures, travel and religion. With your Chiron/Moon blend opposite your Aries Stellium in your 5th house, you’re a natural with working with children, making a most excellent coach, teaching others, with inspiration, something that you find most difficult doing for yourself, ironically and so regrettably, but still, being so driven, galvanized and strong minded, as you are, will be very successful at. With your ruler of your 6th house of work, Venus, in your 7th house of partners, you’re best working environment is with close contact with others, preferably on a one on one basis. Your ruler of your 10th house of career, Mercury, is in your 5th house of romance, within your stellium, with emphasis on creativity, sports, speculation, children, hobbies, gambling, games, self expression, the arts, etc. , which all can be major contributors to a most satisfying career for you. With Sagittarius on your 2nd house cusp, you are expanding your house of money, values and personal possessions. Having its ruler, Jupiter in this house, makes it even more of a priority to you, with finding much luck, ease of working and good fortune coming through successful and hugely profitable business ventures that increase your personal wealth and property. You will bring gain to your self, through law, insurance, banking, religion, science, education, literature and travel, while inclining to favorable government and business affairs. Since, Jupiter is the apex of your T-Square, it’d seem the most advantageous way to bring this about, would be to develop your empty leg, being your 8th house of transitions, death, sex and other people’s resources, by focusing on its rulers(Mercury), beneficial aspects, being a conjunct to your Sun(strong focused mind) and a trine to Ceres(nurturing), enabling you to nurture others by your words because nurturing is part of your nature, even if combined with so much energy and action, with it, as you have. This all making a field of any of the service careers most fitting for you, from food service to teacher to a very understanding therapist, also. By coincidence, a extremely fortunate transit is happening to you, right now, with your progressed Moon conjunct your MH this month, exact at the end of the month. This only happens every 30 years, being very favorable for promotions, finding employment and contracts, so easily, particularly with transit Jupiter conjunct your natal Jupiter, as it is now. Even with such passionate and obsessive feelings being felt today, only to want action, because transit Mars is on your natal Pluto, best to note that, Tuesday January 28, 2020 has the transit Moon, Venus, Neptune lineup sextiling your natal Jupiter, making your career almost ideal in either the one you have now, or to be found, with a possible windfall coming your way, as well.

I maxed out my cards, too, with no way to pay them back, with jail possible now, since I doubt very much that I’d show up for court, which means a bench warrant for me. For you, living in your car would be very miserable, I imagine. I’ve lived similar to that before and really missed running water and electricity a whole lot. Also, too bad about your dog, who’s going to be missing you so much, being so upset that you’re gone and not around, never to be coming back. Thinking about my dog would make me reconsider my planed attempts, for me, but now she died a few months ago, with my cat a month later, so only my business partner, is the one who would be upset, if I upped and died, since I won’t be productive anymore with our loosing business. Adding to all this, for you, is failing your classes and loosing your school loan, so regrettably, which must really be doing such terrible stuff to your self esteem and would really seem to make all future scenarios just so much more of a gloom and doom, possibility, most certainly.

With these connections, Saturn will be quite busy criticizing and devaluing the feelings, social abilities and types of energy( of the other planets), that is being put into your endeavors, throughout life, with the faster planets antagonizing Saturn, as well. With Saturn in Pisces, in the 3rd house, it’s mission is to get away from all the worry, gloom and anxiety your mind is prone to have, achieving, with much hard work, mental discipline, concentration, orderly reasoning and logical thinking. With maturity, you will develop a contemplative mind, responsible, thoughtful and capable of concentration on serious or profound subjects.

Communication, again, is emphasized, with your Mars in Gemini, in your 6th house of work, health and small animals, with you having many irons in the fire, being all over the place trying to make one more connection, since having such a inner need to communicate, as you do.

This placement of the asteroid Chiron in your 1st house in Gemini, on top of your Ascendant implies your deepest wound in life has been how others have perceived you, your physical appearance as well as, possibly, your communicative presentation, causing possible rejection to outright bullying, from others, at times.

Transit Neptune is making its 3rd and last of 3 squares to your Chiron, at this time, ending a 2 year phase of its cycle with your Chiron, in which it’s been asking you to change and wanting to show you something else you need to be doing, instead, or at least differently. Neptune has also been going through your 10th house of career for the last 8 years now, clouding your vision of where you are headed in life , causing inner restlessness and confusion. As well as squaring your Chiron, transit Neptune has been squaring your Venus, Saturn, Uranus and Ceres stellium in Sagittarius on the Descendant, being in both the 6th and 7th houses, while influencing the 7th house of relationships more so. Neptune squaring your Venus and Saturn, presently, results in bouts of idealism that may carry you away to the point of damaging or obscuring your true life values. There could be a tendency to view your accomplishments as having almost no substance, at this time, while a false sense of ideals may mislead you and cause you to neglect your responsibilities and get lost in what will amount to a bunch of nothing, so regrettably. Transit Neptune is also making a temporary T-Square in your chart with the empty leg being your 4th house of home life, which needs to be developed so as to relieve stress caused by this T-Square. The way to develop this house is to focus on the beneficial aspects of the 4th house cusp ruler, being two planets, in your case, since the cusp is at 29 degrees, being influenced by two signs. So they are your Sun and Mercury conjunction in your 8th and 9th houses, with the Sun in both, because of being so close to the cusp, as well as Mercury’s pull on it into the 9th. The most beneficial aspect to this conjunction is undoubtedly the sextile to your Mars, very well positioned in its home sign in the 11th house of groups and friends, while being part of your Bisextile chart configuration, causing steady smooth development of a excellent influence to all matters pertaining to work, travel and communications, which is being triggered at this time, also, by chance, dominated by a transit Jupiter square this winter. This square might make you overconfident at this time, as to be to your possible, detriment. Success and progress can be had during this transit, though, but only if you apply moderation to your efforts. Don’t force anything or anyone, since it might be too easy to come across as threatening or overbearing at this time. You are restless in physical terms and to regards to your desire nature. You are looking for more from life, but you may have a hard time satisfying your urges. You may find yourself more adventurous on a sexual level, also. So be extra cautious with regards to physical risks. Accidents are not a given during this transit, but they are more likely to happen, if you are not careful, particularly with sharp objects. Your restlessness can lure you into reckless situations. Also of note is your Secondary Progressed Moon coming on a exact sextile to your natal Jupiter in two days, while on your Progressed Venus and indicating a warm expanse of emotional growth has been underway, even if not being noticed, by you, making it easier to reach out and be included, adding to your own inner life while giving to others. Generosity is its own reward, especially when you don’t ask for one, and it will come back to you at just the right time. Anticipating the wants and needs of others can be your ticket to success at a time like this, as well as putting emphasis on education, reading and travel, so as to broaden your horizons, bringing opportunities, more so with interests, such as to pertaining to law, politics and publishing. Transit Neptune is now applying to a most fortunate conjunction with your natal Jupiter for the next couple of years, with you pursuing more spiritual directions and possibly finding someone who can guide you into realizing your fondest inner dreams and ideals."
AstrologyChartShare,fcsq2nq,t3_eibtxj,1577922239.0,"Hello youngster, off hand, looking at your chart, it looks like a bucket shaped pattern of planets, mostly at the top of your chart, making you very extroverted. Mars Retro in Leo in the 5th house would be the handle of the bucket, with the 5th house affairs the theme for your life. Mars is also the ruler of your Ascendant and Sun and coruler of your Moon, as well as in mutual reception with the Sun, being in each other’s sign, making Mars pretty much the ruler of your chart, it would seem. With such emphasis on the 5th house, though, while being associated with the 1st, 8th and 12th houses, and Pluto ruler of its own house, 8th, while being deposited their, also, it seems, transformation through intense sexual romantic affairs,  are what you might be seeking in this life, along with having much interest in sports, creativity and children, playing a big part, for you, too, as well. With your Sun in the 12th house along with a possible Mars presence in the 12th, also, because of mutual reception, there’s a possibility of loss and restrictions at times, so sadly. I imagine this could possibly be offset by using this 12th house influence in forming your career by using your Bisextile configuration consisting of two sextiles and your most fortunate Sun/Moon trine, with the sextiles to your Uranus/Neptune conjunction in your 10th house of career. The main flow for you it seems, is fulfilling your desire for useful service to your community through work in hospitals, churches and institutions of higher learning, while pursuing a profession in psychology, art or literature as some of many possibilities. Your Sun is also within a 7 degree orb conjunction with your Ascendant, essentially giving you many traits of Leo to your Ascendant, making it a added co-sign, so to speak, letting the benevolent description of Leo rising, if only being a subtle, more subconscious undertone(12th house), have a very small bit part with your dominant energetic Aries rising sign, which would be so helpful in all of your pursuits."
AstrologyChartShare,fcocghn,t3_ei4s0a,1577828853.0,"Hello Memarie, even though, nimr_od made some very valid points on your charts, describing your relationship interactions and potential, very well, I’d still like to comment on a couple aspects you and Andrew have that I think are quite significant, which is your Neptune trine Andrews Moon and your Mercury conjunct Andrews Venus in his 7th house of marriage. The Neptune Moon trine is 22 minutes apart, being very close and possibly one of the most significant aspects, making him have a sensitivity and receptivity to your romantic creativity, easily picking up on your imaginative romantic scenarios, with a natural sense of harmony that brings you together and unites you as one. You are both likely to exhibit intuitive, empathetic spiritual gifts, communicating without words, dream sharing and proximity awareness, with him, also, having a easy time anticipating your needs for nurturance and gentle understanding, too. With this aspect, you will undoubtedly, inspire each other. With your Mercury conjunct Andrews Venus being only one degree 5 minutes apart, he is very attracted to your intellectual abilities, your ideas and romantic creativity, you will greatly enjoy talking and listening to him, having common interests and compatible ideas about love, romance and domestic relationships."
AstrologyChartShare,fcntqg7,t3_ei1uuq,1577818236.0,"Hello youngster, the first impression of your chart to me is that everything is in the Southern(top) Hemisphere, except asteroid Chiron, making you very much a extrovert. Next, your planets make a fan shaped pattern with Pluto as the handle in the 7th house of relationships, making this houses affairs, a great source of support and nourishment. Next, your Sun/Uranus conjunction in Aquarius in the 10th house conjuncting the Mid Heaven, making you potentially, a genius and a natural entrepreneur, capable of much success in a multitude of fields, including anything to deal with creativity, inventions, science, technology, aviation, computers and the internet. This Sun/Uranus conjunction is a part of your only chart configuration, being a Bisextile, consisting of two sextiles and one trine. The two sextiles are more dynamic and will help you access and develop your trine of Saturn with Pluto which gives you great self discipline, self reliance, determination and high ideals. The last couple of weeks, transit Venus has been in your 10th house, letting you be very charming in any of your areas of achievement such as work and school, which will continue another couple of weeks, yet. Most auspicious time for improvements in these areas, for you. Also, at this time, your Progressed Mars is conjuncting your natal Ceres at 23 degrees Pisces this winter, with a focus on nurturing in your social group of friends, being very important to you, as it is, since your natal Mars is here as well as your natal Jupiter positioned on both the cusp of Pisces and so near the 11th house cusp, to make it both a Aquarius and Pisces designation, as well as energizing both the 10th and 11th houses affairs, too, making it very fortunate for you in receiving much assistance from higher ups, in your climb for recognition and success."
AstrologyChartShare,fckqria,t3_egyjlw,1577731163.0,"Hello Hailey, I see that you have 3 major configurations in your chart. A T-Square, Trapeze and a Mystic Triangle, with your T-Square the most dynamic and troublesome for you, while also being what is motivating you, most of the time. This T-Square has become very active this last month, with transit Saturn and Pluto in your 4th house of home life, opposing your natal Moon in your 10th house of career and social position. This might become challenging at times, for you, with changes of residency, possibly, particularly since your natal Uranus(sudden change) is in the 4th house, too. Right now the extreme emphasis on your natal Moon will strengthen with first transit Mars than transit Jupiter coming into opposing and eventually squaring your 7th house natal Saturn making relationships most challenging this coming year at times. Transit Saturn is also Trining your natal Venus in your 8th house of sex, making a very highly charged relationship possible that would be long term, if started in the next several months. At this very same time, your progressed Sun is conjuncting your natal Moon, coming exact this April, marking this year as a time you truly get in touch with your feelings, beyond your wildest expectations, reaching a new equilibrium, with the way you act and react suddenly becoming one. This is a powerful influence and denotes a entire change in your life, producing either advancement and elevation to a much better state of things, or a critical period in which a crisis of affairs is reached, and important changes follow. Also at this same time, your progressed Moon is sextile your natal Sun, designating that your insides and outsides are working hand in glove for awhile, so you can rely on your instincts when making emotional judgements, now. Similarly you’re more likely to be seen as a integrated personality, one to be relied upon. Your all of a piece, and the pieces all fit together."
AstrologyChartShare,fcic7gp,t3_efrg7c,1577660403.0,"One more thing. I needed to check your progressed chart, since that pertains to events, more so. Last April 4th, your progressed Sun squared your natal Venus, with a possibly loss of property as well as many drains on the purse, a tendency to loose money, coupled with domestic afflictions and sorrows and afflictions of many sorts. This April you will have a progressed Mercury opposite your natal Saturn which does not bode well for any domestic dispute and for signing of important papers. These interpretations are based on Alan Leo’s 1906 book."
AstrologyChartShare,fci0qst,t3_efrg7c,1577656383.0,"Hello Pepper, I’ve been looking over your chart, seeing a transit Uranus opposite natal Uranus you’ve been dealing with since last May, with the eclipse having the most impact on, amplifying this most troublesome thing, which is effecting you so, harshly, now. You’ve already had 2 passes, with your 3rd and final pass  going to be on March 17, 2020, along with the first weekend of April, being triggered by transit Mars opposing your Saturn, as well, causing some type of brief challenge for you, at that time, most likely. At the beginning of this coming February, transit Saturn will become more influential, for you, applying a square to your natal Uranus as well as a opposition to your natal Saturn. So in essence you’ll have a temporary Grand Square happening, for a few months, as well as two outer planet oppositions to themselves, in your natal chart. Even if they are life cycle, generational, mid life transits, Saturn opposite Saturn and Uranus opposite Uranus, can be very miserable, as well as torturous, at times, particularly when triggered by the Moon, Sun, or Mars, causing some event to occur. Having had a challenging temporary T-square, now, since last May, with the empty leg being the 12th house of spirituality, waiting for you, to finish developing, by focusing on its ruler, Saturn, and its most favorable natal aspects, is the best method, I know of, in alleviating the stress this is causing, you, which is highly recommended method, by many. The remedy for all this, then, is your very close, though in conflicting signs, natal Saturn trine natal Sun, aspect. Focusing on the fortunate influence of this trine, which for you is being steady, patient, persevering, reliable and honesty, with how it pertains to the affairs of the 9th(higher learning) and 10th(career) houses, where the sun is positioned, as well as the house it rules, the 7th (relationships), is the most favorable use of this energy, now. Also this same energy is needed for the 6th(work, health and pets) and 12th houses(spirituality, karma, loss) too, because of Saturns position and rulership, here, as well. Coming very soon, though, to you, is the temporary Grand Square, slowly emerging in March, when things will change some, at that time, with more urgency for you to balance the polarity of the 6th and 12th houses as well as the 3rd and 9th, too, with the cosmos actually placing people, places and things in your life to make sure the balances are accomplished as well as maintained, for a few month’s, as well as at the start of next year, also. In affect, a tight rope act, for you, will start, of not too much daily work at the expense of spiritual maintenance such as meditation, therapy or being alone in nature, etc., and visa versa. The same for the 3rd and 9th, by not doing too much delving into intellectual paths pertaining to religion philosophy metaphysical and spiritual research, at the expense of neglecting your community and daily interactions with acquaintances, siblings, casual friendships and communications, which will actually be giving you a catalyst for a new type of self expression, at this time, as well, with visa versa, too, also."
AstrologyChartShare,fc9kmgt,t3_ef2nol,1577554063.0,"Hello, again, I neglected your question. Sorry. With your ruler of your 10th house of career, being Mercury in Scorpio positioned in the 12th house, making the affairs of this house to be the main contributors to your true vocation. Working with prisoners, the insane, hospitalized, underprivileged or people who have a strong urge to escape from everyday reality, is to be the most fulfilling and interest to you, since most likely your karmic purpose, is entwined with this. With a shrewd and penetrating mind, you have great psychological instincts and are able to get to the causes beneath the surface of life. You are quite talented in the arts, also, with it possibly becoming very lucrative for you, with your Venus in your 2nd house of money. With your Uranus and Neptune their also, you will devise ingenious ways in making money, with your imaginative and spiritual potential, manifesting through intuitive and mysterious ways of doing so, and using it idealistically for the benefit of others. Additionally, having your Jupiter and Saturn in your 6th house of work, implies that you have much ability and capable of immense enjoyment in practicing any of the healing arts, and the many professions that involves. Your North Node in your 8th house of transitions, basically, designates a total personality transformation is mapped out for you, this lifetime."
AstrologyChartShare,fc6ozo6,t1_fc5we38,1577485844.0,"Hello, thank you for showing your most favorable VENUS conjunct ASCENDANT charm and enthusiasm in your reply’s. This focused aspect, of your VENUS, extremely close, within a few minutes of your ASCENDANT, will be a very strong attractant, to many that are entranced with your beauty, both physically as well as your inner personality you present to them. You might be so very welcoming, to them, also, since your MOON is in your 5th house, with your emotional well being, very dependent on any  romantic interest you have going on, at any particular time. Having NEPTUNE in your 5th house, also, with it being the ruler of your 7th house of relationships, signifies needing a playful partner to assist you in your self expressive endeavors, to almost being a prerequisite for your creativity to manifest itself, in you. Individuals who are more child like in their disposition and energy, are the most fulfilling to you, and you’ll be drawn to them, mostly, more than any others. Being deeply, romantically in love is so necessary, for you, when and if you commit, in some fashion, eventually, but hopefully, much later in life, because of your thwarting aspects. Your NEPTUNE, having several adverse aspects such as its square to MARS, might mean that you could have a idealistic perception of possible committed partners, leading to disappointments, as well as possibly being deceived in some manner, or maybe someone that has active addictions going on, only to be a way of letting them be a victim for you to take care of. Some astrologers suggest keeping it only romantic play, with planetary positions as yours, avoiding any firm commitment, when the trouble will arrive, until your self esteem develops with more self acceptance and confidence, built up in you, contingent on the type and amounts of transits, that bombard you, in your life. Your SUN opposition to NEPTUNE, signifies much spiritual growth, to be had, for you, possibly because of all the peculiar or irregular love affairs, you will be having, throughout your life. Even though, you’ll most likely have many affairs before this, your SECONDARY PROGRESSED CHART shows a charming individual entering your life, most notably between January and September 2022, being symbolized by PROGRESSED MERCURY SESQUIQUINTILE to your JUNO/CHIRON conjunction, at the same time as the PROGRESSED SUN/VENUS conjunction, squares and PROGRESSED MOON conjuncts your JUNO, boding so much to some type of commitment type of relationship occurring, particularly since PROGRESSED CHARTS are more about predicting events, with transits predictions, concerning, reactions, more so. Be very careful in 2022. One more thing, concerning your JUNO/CHIRON conjunction in a intercepted sign (SCORPIO) in your 3rd house signifies more introspectiveness, relying heavily on your intuition and your deep down feelings when interacting with partners, as the way to go, for you. The same goes for your other intercepted planets, MARS, JUPITER and SATURN, in the way you develop them, as well. Also, Chiron shows where we have been wounded, resulting, most likely, in teaching and showing others how something can be done, without it actually occurring for ourselves, to be deprived, so. Being JUNO, it’s commitments such as marriage, or at least a very satisfying marriage, that might never happen, for you, so regrettably. Of course, nothing is written in stone, there’s some things I’m not taking in account, here, such as your most beneficial of trines between your JUPITER and VENUS, being awfully close at little over a degree, offsetting a lot of this dismal stuff. With your JUPITER in the 9th of distant journeys, having a romantic interest with someone from a foreign country or even someone affiliated with institutions of higher learning may offset this relationship karma, you have. It seems to me that individuals with GRAND CROSSES always have so much going on in their charts, making nothing cut and dry."
AstrologyChartShare,fc642xp,t3_ef2nol,1577471807.0,"Hello youngster, you have 2 configurations in your chart. A MARS PLUTO URANUS BISEXTILE and a SUN NEPTUNE JUPITER MYSTIC TRIANGLE. The pattern your chart displays is a LOCOMOTIVE with MARS as the engine in your 10th house of career, along with being part of your BISEXTILE, it gives indefatigable energy, initiative and drive to achieve fame and social status. Courage, ambition, energy, enterprise, force, emotional involvement, business acumen and a strong compulsive drive for success may lead you to public achievement or professional recognition. With your MARS in LIBRA, though, it inclines that you have a very diplomatic approach, with being always courteous and concerned for others and bending rather than arguing.  With transit asteroid JUNO (timer of relationships) on your MARS, now’s the time to be on the lookout for someone, either romantic, professional or both. Along with this, transit VENUS is also trining your MARS, giving you success and ease in close personal relationships, with you exhibiting much passion, warmth and lively, sexy expressiveness. The long lasting transit of NEPTUNE trining your MERCURY (ruler of your 7th house of relationships) and sextile to your VENUS (ruler of your 6th house of work and coworkers) is most fortunate for you, resulting in obtaining more compassion and a most fruitful heartfelt communication, style, particularly in the affairs of these 2 houses. Your natal JUNO, being in AQUARIUS, in the 3rd house, conjunct your URANUS, means a unusual partner or partnership is to your liking, as long as communication is of utmost importance to both. All these transits have a 3 month lingering effect, since occurring during the solar eclipse two days ago, with the NEPTUNE transit lasting a few years, because of it being so far away and taking so long to travel around the SUN, being 165 years."

A GRAND CROSS is also called a GRAND SQUARE, with quite a lot of talent coming from it, particularly since it pushes for perfectionism. Steve Jobs had a mutable GRAND SQUARE. Yours is fixed, so you find yourself not being able to exactly know where to put your talent, causing a stand still. GRAND SQUARES are tight rope balancing acts, making sure not to do too much of either end of the two oppositions that it contains. Your SUN/MERCURY in your 11th house opposite your NEPTUNE in the 5th house is the more dynamic polarity that will take your attention, to keep balanced, if not,  the cosmos will let people and places appear in your life to make sure it is so. This polarity deals with the balance between the personal (5th house) and the impersonal (11th house). The 5th house rules creativity self expression, romance, children and anything that boosts the individual ego  The 11th rules the group, more impersonal friendships and objectivity. Your GRAND SQUARE is there to make sure you put equal attention in these two areas and not to much on either one, so as to maintain a balance. Sorry, I am not able to do any more tonight, because it’s my bedtime. Maybe tomorrow, if you’re wanting more."

Besides having such a glaring fixed natal GRAND CROSS, which has you going in many directions at once, only to get stuck spinning your wheels, accomplishing very little, you have a temporary GRAND TRINE, set up by last night’s SOLAR ECLIPSE. With transit JUPITER involved trining your natal VENUS and JUPITER. It cannot get much better. For the next few months you will be feeling very generous and romantic, with this positive attitude helping to attract positive experiences and situations into your life. You are feeling very creative and your social life is activated and enhanced, with JUPITER expanding your desire for pleasure, romance and material goods, at this time. This is a time of good fortune when things open up in a very natural way for you. Situations are almost tailored made for you, and it is easy to see which path is the one to take. Opportunities abound, and you might find yourself wanting (and able) to do almost everything, at this time. With your JUNO ( timer of relationships) in SCORPIO positioned in your 3rd house, having a partner that’s communicative and highly sexual, is very important to you.

The first has MERCURY, MARS and JUPITER with a trine between MERCURY and JUPITER which is one of the best aspects in regard to the mind that can occur in any horoscope. General good fortune and success in life is promised - due mainly to a positive, evolved, cultured and kindly disposition. You are endowed with a balanced mentality with a sound sense of humor and much common sense. You have excellent judgement and possess a broad mind - one that is philosophical, intuitive and harmonious. More over you have the ability to think clearly, deeply and seriously, with your mind expanding even more so through travel, religion and higher education. Your second Bisextile has SATURN, VENUS and NEPTUNE, with a very close trine between SATURN and NEPTUNE, which brings practicality and stability to your idealistic aspirations and it is favorable for the practical application of mystical or occult principles, too. It endows you with depth and clearness of thought, inspirational ideas and intuition, concentration and clairaudience - these qualities used with foresight, self restraint and caution will bring slow attainment and success. There may be a element of sacrifice - the enduring of tedious, methodical, painstaking and patient work for the completion of humanitarian projects. The properties of both these Bisextiles are developed gradually into their distinctive and specialized talent , and are formed through the course of your life time. The 2 sextiles in each of these Bisextiles affiliates access to the benefits of each trine, making it so much easier to obtain and to apply, when necessary, in your life."

Being so close, it’s almost like your SUN is in ARIES, too, even if a very protective Aries, as well as such a very strong CANCER impact, all in all, particularly being in Cancer’s house conjunct Cancer’s ruler, the MOON. Your MOON is so close to VENUS its like it’s in TAURUS, being its most favorite of signs to be in, even more so than its home sign of CANCER, which it likes a whole lot, so much too. With only 7 minutes apart, your MOON and VENUS are like joined at the hip, which they enjoy to the utmost, being very happy together, bringing out the very best characteristics of each and with no major hard natal aspects occurring at all, to mess things up for them. You have much sensitivity, charm and elegance, sensing easily the mood and feelings of others. You are excellent at nursing and counseling , with your day to day response to circumstances, strongly conditioned by family relationships and domestic issues. Security is your main preoccupation, depending on feelings and intuition to get around in life, while also possessing good common sense, you are always very practical and down to earth - mothering and extremely protective to all. Last night’s solar eclipse happened on your MH, 10th house cusp, being very significant and most fortunate to your career and general recognition in society, most certainly so, with Jupiter attached so close to this, making a high water mark, as you make your way using clear vision and common sense, with career choices and opportunities. Your most difficult period of the last couple of years is pretty much gone now with transit SATURN opposing your planets in your 4th house, which caused many blocks and conflicts, particularly with PLUTO also causing such relentless changes for you, the last several years, too. This might be a most auspicious time for a most charming partner for you, to appear, since the asteroid, JUNO( timer of marriage type of events), is in your 7th house of marriage. Even if you get the out of the ordinary partner, that would satisfy you the most, domineering issues, might develop, so sadly."
