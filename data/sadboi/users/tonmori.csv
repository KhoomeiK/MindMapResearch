AskReddit,fahwjs4,t3_e98jnm,1576094974.0,There was this book I read when I was younger where this guy murdered fairies and collected their bones to make statues. I have no idea what it was called and no idea how to search for it.
depression,f38usc7,t1_f38koxu,1570740258.0,I have an appointment booked for Tuesday to see if they'll let me go back on meds. I guess I do wanna get better but theres always the follow up question 'why' in my head.

depression,ew82zrk,t3_cn4s45,1565202322.0,"I snapped, quit my job, moved back in with my mum and my paranoia and depression sky rocketed. Some people came to the realisation that I'd been 'faking' myself for years but some just thought I was faking this. Basically, you can snap and your friends will be there for you, but you'll very quickly realise who aren't your friends."

depression,evpnjzj,t3_ckmvf8,1564676924.0,"Exactly this. Went and saw a counsellor yesterday and tried to explain that I wasn't hiding anything, I just didnt know what I was supposed to say or how to find my thoughts and he keeps thinking that I'm just not saying anything because I dont want to. It's like I'm trying to pick a thought out of my head and then it just desolves before I can say it. So I told him next time, if I go back which I might not because I kinda wanna give up on the whole system, I'm just going to write everything I want to say on a piece of paper and hand it over to him. It's not that I'm trying to hide anything, it just never seems like I can pinpoint my memories."
relationships,euwzv33,t1_euwx0rr,1564081575.0,Thank you :) It does suck watching movies and tv shows where all the teenagers are talking about their 5 exes and two current partners et c haha
relationships,euwvr9t,t1_euwv4uz,1564080161.0,I'm sure everything will work out and you'll find someone you really click with :) I'm hoping the same for me haha

relationships,euwvgge,t1_euwsqvm,1564080058.0,"I did once try to get into a relationship. One with someone who was constantly dating someone else and just used me whenever they were lonely. But that obviously didnt work out. I am clear with people and I never really ghost anyone. It's taken me some time, but I do know that adding someone to my life isn't going to fix me. Sometimes, I forget that I am trying other ways to get better. Thank you for your advice :)"
relationships,euwuesj,t1_euwrcv9,1564079699.0,"Is there a specific link between being 30 and being a wizard? If so, cannot wait!

And, thanks :) It's taken me a little bit of time to realise it, but I definately need to sort myself out before involving someone else in my life. Everyones comments have definately helped."
relationships,euwu1xc,t1_euwpqmj,1564079576.0,Thanks :) I agree that I should wait to click with someone instead of getting into a bad relationship. Just need to sort my issues out before I try anything serious
relationships,euwtp2a,t1_euwou61,1564079459.0,"Pretty much going through the same thing tbh. Came out when I was 17 and then just never really met any gay ladies until I was around 23 and even then, like I say, my anxiety and depression messed everything up. It's hard to meet people but I'll probably find it a little easier when I've sorted my problems out. I hope everything works out wonderfully for you :)"

relationships,euwsrl5,t1_euwkrbe,1564079124.0,"Thank you. Think I'll put myself back out there when I'm more emotionally stable Haha. It's a little hard to meet people sometimes who I click with but, yeah, hopefully it will all fall into place eventually :)"
relationships,euws8ho,t1_euwi39p,1564078934.0,"Thank you. The friends with benefits one is definately a heartbreaker. Been there and it sucked because they constantly said they'd be with me eventually and then would constantly date other people :/ It does help to hear I'm not alone, thank you"
relationships,euwrt3q,t1_euwju35,1564078788.0,"Feel exactly that, the cycle is horrible and sometimes it feels like I need a relationship to sort myself out but I know that doesnt logically make any sense. Having friends helps but when they're always talking about their exes and current partners, it's not like I can join in on that conversation and, yeah, it sucks"

relationships,euw5ikx,t1_euvy4oa,1564070778.0,It is good to know there are other people! I think I sometimes try too hard with people and it absolutely gets exhausting and sometimes just isn't worth the effort. I assume at some time I'll find someone who I just click with but I'm gonna put it on pause for a little while and focus on myself :) I hope you find someone you click with; it must get easier after that? I don't know Haha :p But the best of luck!
relationships,euw56zp,t1_euw3gsi,1564070582.0,I think the problem with me is I try sometimes a little too hard to get people to like me and it shouldn't take that much effort. I'm gonna try and give it a break. I dont have much advice to offer but I wish you the best of luck out there :)
