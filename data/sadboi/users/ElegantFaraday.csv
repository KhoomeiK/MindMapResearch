Intel does tremendous amounts of work for it's supply chain management, donating to charities, environment and employee satisfaction. Unlike other companies, you don't see public ads about their work... And again, I'm not saying they are perfectly ethically, they are not. However, they are better than AMD and almost all semiconductor companies.

Here are some examples:

Employment: 
Looking at employee reviews is an important factor in employee satisfaction. We can see both are 4 stars and are similar in this aspect.  https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Intel-Corporation-Reviews-E1519.htm vs AMD https://www.glassdoor.ca/Overview/Working-at-AMD-EI_IE15.11,14.htm

Intel response to pandemic: 
Intel let all non-essential employees choose to work from home a week before the [pandemic](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/2020/03/intel-responding-to-coronavirus-says-many-employees-can-work-from-home.html%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwius8nr9_7oAhUIv54KHewrCsQQFjAGegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw2brqIEv3mHDAVLzmUQjYIC&ampcf=1&cshid=1587658358292) and then obviously all non-essential employees had to work from home after the pandemic started. I couldn't find details on AMD's response on COVID 19. So, we can't really know. Intel also [donated multiple times to Red-cross and hospitals](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-commits-technology-response-combat-coronavirus/)



Both at 4 stars

Environmental:

Intel's [effort to save water](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/intel-reaches-1-billion-gallons-water-restored/) and their [environmental plan](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/environment/intel-and-the-environment.html)

AMD's [efforts on the planet](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate-responsibility/planet)

We can see further confirmations of Intel doing a great job overall based on different media. [3BL ranks Intel 2nd overall, 4th for employee relations and 5th for environmental](https://www.3blmedia.com/News/Intel-Named-One-100-Best-Corporate-Citizens-2019-CR-Magazine), another example is [Forbes ranks Intel most environmentally friendly in the semiconductor industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/justcapital/2019/04/22/the-top-33-companies-for-the-environment-by-industry/)

Ethical rankings based on different media:
[ethisphere includes Intel but not amd](https://www.worldsmostethicalcompanies.com/honorees/?fwp_industry=electronics-semiconductors&fwp_number_of_employees=6603.00%2C110000.00), you can find how they did their ranking [here ](https://ethisphere.com/ethisphere-announces-the-2020-worlds-most-ethical-companies/) and we see a similar trend with [corporate knights](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.corporateknights.com/reports/2019-global-100/2019-global-100-results-15481153/&ved=2ahUKEwiEjYWt_f7oAhXUs54KHdzuD7YQFjACegQICxAJ&usg=AOvVaw2Pma0-LTxKKmcWH3FNXA8U)

Supply chain management:

Intel is known to have some issues with supply chain management, but it is still one of the best in the world. [Gartner ranks Intel 6 ](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-05-16-gartner-announces-rankings-of-the-2019-supply-chain-t). It's important to note that while rank 6, they got 6/10 for transparency (not so good).

Does this indicate that Intel is an ethical company? Not really, but we can see that Intel has done some good for it's community and the environment. AMD is not a large company, so they are less likely to be in the rankings. However, super ethical based companies will always make it to the list (such as Patagonia). Similarly, when Intel makes a mistake you will see it in the news more than if AMD did. You can do your own research on which company is more ethical, but based on my view Intel is. Intel has done some shady stuff such as unfair comparison between previous gen CPUs and to AMD. AMD learned from Intel to not make similar mistakes with Ryzen. 

Edit: I noticed there are some grammatical and formatting issues, but I'm on the phone and it's pretty hard to edit, sorry."

intel,fo4vr3u,t3_g5q42d,1587512171.0,"I think we have seen similar behaviours when the underdog outperforms. In this case, AMD has been able to do better than Intel in most categories at the same price range. So the anticipation and excitement has turned into had and toxicity. There could many reasons for this. One of the main would be people blindly thinking Intel CPU means it is better than AMD, so the fan boys and newly enlightened people will try to mock and hate on Intel. 

To me it doesn't make sense to hate on Intel. Some see Intel as the devil, but they've only been following normal business strategies. They have high prices but they have high costs too. People are not looking at other aspects of each company, such as supply chain management, employee treatment, etc. Intel, while it has its issues, is more ethical than AMD. They have better customer service as well, they have better support and security, and etc. They also don't realize Intel is a huge company, they make SSDs, mobileEye, and many other services for B2B industry.

Edit: and clearly a lot of people were anticipating Intel to use 10nm for a few years now. Now people think 10nm is behind 7nm, but due to diverse standards 10nm Intel is equivalent to 7nm TSMC."

Aside from the obvious severity compared to the flu, we don't know the longterm effects of this virus. Hopefully there are none. Let's compare it to another virus with lower mortality rate than Covid19 and similar to the flu. Polio initially seems pretty innocent. 70% of patients get no symptoms, but 0.5% get muscle weakness. From which 15-30% of them die. Patients who do survive might develop paralysis over time. Additionally, years later they might develop post polio symptoms that might never go away.

Edit:
I visited 3 different physios before my last physio gave me these workouts that helped me sooo much. 

I'd consult a physio before doing this. However, my overall understanding is lower back issues get better as you increase activities that don't involve rotations. Otherwise, you are slowly weakening the muscles in your body and are putting more pressure on your spine. That would lead to a cycle of chronic pain."

I find it easier to rent the Titan online for algorithms that require such power. 9700k should be plenty due to its high core, but it is limited to only 8 threats. If you do require more threats, at the same price you can purchase the 3700x or 8700k. The 3700x is definitely a better choice over 8700k though in almost every aspect \[other than core clock speed\] :) 

&#x200B;

Unless you also require high clock speeds, the 3700x might be a better overall choice. However, I still think renting it online would be much easier in most cases lol."
buildapc,eu74iiz,t1_eu6yb0o,1563517745.0,"the ram is def a bottleneck. I do think you think you are CPU bounded if your CPU runs at \~70%. Never the less, anything above a 2060 would have seen a huge bottleneck :)"

I'll add this to the edit :)"
bapcsalescanada,eu6lwqk,t1_eu5dlcf,1563503318.0,Yeah. Though recently I have been facing issues with them. I bought the phanteks evolv and it said will be shipped next day and it has been 2 weeks now. Though their customer service is great and I'm not in a rush and the deal was pretty good
buildapc,eu6g0mm,t1_eu6dwuz,1563499474.0,That's actually very true. I forgot to talk about that. 0.1% lows are critical for intense games and they always happen in important situations lol
buildapc,eu6fx9t,t1_eu6capj,1563499414.0,"I have high hopes for the next Intel CPUs. The 10th gen laptop CPUs look really good, so can't wait for them to release the desktop CPUs. 

&#x200B;

9700k is probably the worst upgrade i've seen from Intel tho :( They stopped hyper threading, so the 8700k is better for some cases."
buildapc,eu6fpph,t1_eu6f5f8,1563499274.0,"Yes, there is always a bottleneck. You are right ryzen 1200 is good enough for 4K gaming, but a dumb decision for something who is running 4K. Unless in the niche case of the person only playing that one game lol."

The above don't require a CPU to flash the motherboard. You can also go to memoryexpress and ask them if they can flash the bios (if you are buying in person).

Def don't get the 2600x, the 3600 is a much better buy. It might be out of stock though :("
buildapc,eu67vlq,t3_cezobl,1563494126.0,"9900k is overkill for the GTX 1080. You would get the same performance with a 8700k or 3600 in gaming. For productivity, 2700x and 3700x should be good enough and with the GTX 1080 you wouldn't see much of an advantage to 9900k anyways. MB and cooler are really good though!"
buildapc,eu67lpf,t1_eu67crh,1563493947.0,Yea Idk why anyone would get the 2600x over the 3600 lol. Unless there is $100 difference...

bapcsalescanada,eu506tj,t1_eu4i0h6,1563467072.0,"That's true, but asus has a larger name. It wasn't until two years ago that I personally preferred asus over EVGA, until I bought an evga GPU used and saw how good their customer service is. Even then, some people still would prefer Asus over EVGA. For example, the RGB colours of an Asus motherboard + GPU would go better together than Asus + EVGA.

Plus we are comparing the flagship asus to the normal EVGA."

However, you should be getting similar performance with either of the two and really comes down to brand preference.

Also, the aorus elite or pro wifi might be a better option over the pro crabon (not sure if that's the case for x570 board tho).

Hopefully, AMD keeps its promise, I'm excited for CPUs to become powerful af due to the high competition."

Awesome, are the size of the transistors different then? If so, is there anywhere that I can find more info about this?

Edit : I can't seem to find them on wikichip, as advised by another redditor."
