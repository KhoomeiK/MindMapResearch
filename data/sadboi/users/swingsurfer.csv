I'm hoping to incorporate some body weight exercises since we're under quarantine here, so that'll probably be my goal for next week. Perhaps I'll incorporate some daily walks too. I could use the fresh air and sunshine. It's just hard when you're in a city to maintain social distancing.

diyguitar,fn7et0v,t3_fxwfiq,1586718907.0,"So I'm a few days in to researching now. Almost ordered parts and then realized I CANNOT FIND A PICKGUARD THAT FITS! 

I'm working with 11 holes. Lefty Japanese made strat. It will NOT fit the modern US / Mexico 11 hole pickguards by ONE screw. The one between the neck pickup and the middle pickup is in  different spot. I've even checked the Fender website with no luck.  

Next recommended steps? Offer a tracing of mine and get a custom one made? Check Ebay? Thank goodness I didn't rush into a preloaded pickguard! Lol"

For the pots, all three of mine actually function, I just have one tone knob that the external part is all messed up. The knob spins and does nothing, but if I remove the knob, it's usable. Is that something I'd need to replace the entire pot for? 

I'll have to read up on what you mean about the orange capacitor. Thanks also for the hack recommendation."
diyguitar,fn4f2dm,t1_fmwzf30,1586640067.0,"Anything I need to look for in a soldering iron and multimeter? They're not expensive on Amazon I see. Also, as far as the actual solder, would I use anything special for a guitar? Will I need anything to mount stuff in thereother than a soldering kit? 

As far as sound goes, I'm just beginning to play again and have always liked my strat's sound for the most part. I need to get a feel for the range I can get as it is before I replace the pickups I think.  I have a randall amp that I've always loved. My end goal is to get some really impressive low end bass and distortion going, while still having a nice clean sound option when I want. Think grunge/metal. 

As of right now, I plan on replacing the 5 way switch (with a fender one), the broken tone knob,  knob covers, possibly the pickup covers (for asthetics), and my pickguard (with a fender 11 screw type to ensure a good fit). That'll get everything in great working order again and give it a snazzy new look so I can really spend my time picking out the pickups I want. 

Originally I was pretty set on a loaded pickguard so I could just do a full swap, but I'm not sure I'm ready to drop that much money to get a quality one. I've warmed up to the idea of tinkering and am less concerned about keeping everything original. I doubt I'll ever sell my rig so I might as well make it uniquely mine! 

Thanks again for your advice! I know I threw in a billion questions out initially, so thanks for bearing with me. This has really helped me figure out what I need to focus on."
diyguitar,fn1n1qe,t3_fxwfiq,1586565541.0,"Thanks for the advice everyone! I've got a good idea of where to start now. I may give soldering a shot on something else and see how that goes.
