In the course of a year, starting with the MeToo movement, there was a significant societal shift in terms of ""consent.""  It is a simple concept and so logical as to be incomprehensible that this should ever have been an issue before but, again as a woman, the concept of men accepting being told ""no"" or not just randomly groping a woman was previously unheard of.  I grew up in the '80's where movies such as Meatballs sold the line ""no means yes"" and the generation of men who grew up with me struggle to see any validity in consent because they have spent their entire lives being told it's okay just to take what they want.  Not all men, of course, but enough of them to make being a woman decidedly unsafe.

But, in the course of a year or so, the up and coming generation of men and women have embraced this concept because it just makes sense.  It's about respect, ultimately.

It can be fairly accurately screened for nowadays and there are thousands of studies that mirror each other regarding their behaviours, methods of operation, red flags, etc.  Even those who do not go on killing rampages (most psychopaths don't resort to such actions) are detrimental to society on every level, from work to family to community.

The Canadian press are doing a good job of not plastering this assholes name everywhere so he can be famous (thank you, press) but what strikes me as outrageous is the fact that the reason this happened at all is because - surprise, surprise! - he was angry with his ex-gf so hunted her down and shot her and her new boyfriend before going on a completely random murder spree.

To summarize, ONCE AGAIN a bitter, angry man can't control his fucking self and becomes violent. No wonder they broke up - guy clearly had issues. But I'm spitting mad!

This happens all the gdamned time and society just continues to ignore the obvious which is that there a hell of a lot of angry, white, misogynists who go on to kill because their fee-fees get hurt and they can't fucking man up and deal.

There's even a legal term for men who commit crimes because their precious fragile fee-fees get hurt: ""crime of passion"" like it's something glamorous and even understandable (with a hint of blame for the victim) for what is ACTUALLY weakness and failure of the self-indulgent manchild to control himself.

The facts are yet to come out but when they do, I'm sure there will be more information about who this guy was but the pattern is undoubtedly the same as all the rest of the men who kill their significant others:  blame-shifting, angry, mired in hate and seeking revenge for hurt feelings, desperate to regain power and control over her.  

Society - men and women both - are quick to judge what women have done to ""earn"" the wrath of men.  Other men generally don't take a strong stand when faced with misogyny from a peer.  Women are degraded, sexualized, victim-blamed, and ignored and this is acceptable to society in general.  Domestic violence is not taken as seriously as it should by anyone, not even the legal system.  

So when I say ""free pass"" I mean that this guy was known in his community, which is very small.  They must have known he had always wanted to be a police officer (but wasn't accepted to become one), that he collected police paraphernalia, that he had a genuine police car, that he had guns, that he had the uniform and ability to pass himself off as an actual officer if he wanted to.

He would always bump me or lean on me or otherwise get in my space until I would have to tell him to lie down (which seemed helped reduce his anxiety).  I was his sheep so a lot of his anxiety occurred if I was out of his sight for a microsecond.  I couldn't even use the bathroom without him guarding the door.  I nicknamed him my Black Shadow.  

The day after he passed during a scheduled euthanasia at the vet, I was tidying up his doghouse area (not that it needed tidying but I guess it was the only way to be close to him again), and I moved the doghouse.  

Shortly after,  I felt a blast of his energy, except it was a horrible, desperate anxiety that wasn't my own, as if he was jumping all over me, trying to get me to comfort him.  Except, instead of jumping on me, he was passing right through, over and over again.  It was so distressing and awful and if he had been alive, I would have hugged him so tight.

I did the only thing I could do, which was move the doghouse back and crouch down as I used to when I'd comfort him while he was alive.  The feeling of anxiety subsided very quickly but I still felt him there, albeit calmer.  He was there for a couple days, guarding, until one morning when I woke up,  I knew he'd finally gone."

Next, tell him he needs to leave by X date.  Period.  Full-stop.  End of story.  Hes a narcissist so he'll figure something out.  They always do."
CanadaCoronavirus,fn6qlkm,t3_fznyob,1586705363.0,"From the article, it sounds like problems with this company went back several years and nothing was done about it by government.  Anyone who has worked for a care facility knows that the risk of burnout is high and that mismanagement at the top contributes to staffing shortages and high turnover rates.  That's what this sounds like to me, based on the article.  Ultimately, responsibility falls on management who were offered help and ultimately refused."

He may follow through on court action anyway but if you can prove you have been reasonable and are keeping the child's best interests at heart, plus tried to negotiate with him, you will likely be fine. 

Make sure you have documented proof of all interactions with your ex.  Do NOT engage in long-winded conversation.  Stick to the facts, be professional, accommodating and as ""grey rock"" as possible."
