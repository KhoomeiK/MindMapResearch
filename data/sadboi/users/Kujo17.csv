Hypothetically if each person only came into contact with say 5-10 other people total  (which in a city that wasnt on lockdown before the cases were seen seems like it could be a fairly low number) that's anywhere from 200-400 people they need to identify and isolate already. And that of course is assuming they catch them in time and none of those people has contracted the virus early enough to have been transmitting it themselves. If not, that number would grow exponentially quite quickly. I believe the city is now back  on lockdown as of a few days ago, but only since the initial cases were identified.

If one wishes the ambiguity around him wasnt a big deal- I personally would recommend *not making it a big deal in the first place* because thatd all those who imo are whining in this thread seem to be doing. Similar to the ""Streisand effect"" mentioned on reddit often - to claim he doesnt need to make it a big deal... while simultaneously making a bigger deal about it than in my knowledge he ever has, is hypocritical and toxic and really only paints the whole community as if we all think that's the only thing that matters. Regardless of if that is the intention, or how well intentioned the motive for doing so may be. 


You are more than welcome to disagree with me- after rereading your comment for a *second* time in ak effort to humor you, It hasnt swayed me from 100% believing in anything I've said. I admire your passion and conviction in this, and I believe I do understand where you are coming from and I'm not saying you dont make valid points however none of those points imo supercede the fact that he is not obligated to live his life in anyway simply because someone else takes offence to it. Asking him to - in my personal opinion- is hypocritical at best. 


Sexuality isnt s big deal and  shouldn't be a big deal. Ranting the way some have in this thread though sure seen to imply it is though, and please  understand that is not directed solely at anything youve said you are not the only one reading this comment. He is not obligated or required to address anything. Would it be nice? Sure- but that doesnt change anything for me.

I do not believe in anyway, celebrity or otherwise, that anyone is obligated to use any specific title, obligated to name their sexuality or gender, obligated to tell absolutely anything about themselves they dont feel completely comfortable telking no matter how much them doinso may benefit the community as a whole. I have been out since I was 14yo- I was forcibly outed. I was disowned by my family and was homeless- most of them still wont even acknowledge my existence.  I was emancipated at 15 as a result solely so I could do what I had to do to survive. Thats been almost 20 years ago now. 

Having gone through that would it have helped me to have more people any the spotlight bringing representation at the time? Absolutely. Would it have been nice to have had more positive role models showing me that regardless of their sexuality they could still accomplish great things? Absolutely. Would it have helped ""normalize' us in the eyes of those who still feel we are an abomination- absolutely. But do I for a second thing that any of that outweighs the belief that they are somehow *obligated* to use whatever label they define themselves as publicly as a result? No, no I do not. I do understand why people would like for him to and why they may feel extremely frustrated he doesnt but ultimstelt I feel that is something that is his personal choice and not something anyone can or should be able to pressure him to do before he is confidently ready to do so- even if he never decides to do so publicly. I find it personslly hypocritical of our community to support that behavior.i really dont know of anything that could every change my view on that specifically. 

I am a proud gay man. I am not ashamed of my sexuality in the least, and since being outed I have never once hid it regardless of how many times i got my ass kicked, how many times i was put in the hospital from the abuse i received in my small town, how many times i cried myself to sleep because i couldnt understand why people could simply hate me for living my life- i have *always* been a proud gay man. But my sexuality in itself does not solely define who I am, and it comes across sometimes as if that's all peolle in our community want to define others as even if that's not the point they are trying to make. Ultimately it really should not matter- and believing that is not the same to me as shame. I am not ashamed of who I am or who I love but if someone isnt ready, or even never wants to publicly name it especially those in the public eye, ultimately that is their choice and I feel we as a community should respect that because *we should understand what that means*.  to equate it with him being ashamed , or wanting to keep it a secret is jumping to an extreme and adding context that simply isnt there and I just feel it is wrong. 

If one doesnt support him simply because he chooses to leave the ambiguity surrounding his sexuality/gender/etc. I dont fault them for it... I do aggressively take offence to people who think that because they feel thst way, they are entitled to pressure him to disclose that information before he is ready solely to suffice their own beliefs. It's wrong no matter who is doing it, regardless of their motivations *no matter how well intentioned*, and that's just how I feel about itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

AskGaybrosOver30,fr3purs,t3_glzcge,1589863075.0,"Congrats on this. I hope you are proud, if not let me be proud for you.  

I came out, well was outed , at 14yo. Drastically different than your situation I know but I hope I can non offer some encouragement to you and give you some hope. I grew up in the bible belt in central Va, and come from am extremely religious family. My mother kicked me out of the house, and though hypocritically they are divorced, my fathers reaction wasnt much better. Ended up having no contact with them for a very long time. 

That said today at 31, I'll be 32 in less than a month, my mother and I reconnected about 6 years ago. It's difficult for her still I can tell she still wrestles with it but we actuslly have a relationship and that's something I didn't think I would ever be able to say. Though we split up about a year ago, my partner and I had been together for almost 10 years. After meeting him I could tell deep down she actually *liked* him. She still never could actuslly call him my partner or boyfriend but she accepted that he was someone I loved and thst he loved me. They went on day-dayes together, shopping, lunch texted and talked often. It was something I genuinely never thought she would be capable of. She even helped me shop for an engagement ring though I ultimately never had the opportunity to present. However I think it was the most evident to me just how much her views had changed in relation to my sexuality When we split up. She comforted me as only a mother can and didnt hesitate for a second to both recognize the love I had and the pain I felt and a result. 

 I can see now, though weve never talked about that period of our life, that I believe she wishes she could have done things differently. I can tell that she wishes she had been more accepting. The fact that she was actually able to empathize when we split, and recognize that I hurt because I wasnt simply ""choosing"" to sin or however she saw it when I was younger is something I again never thought I would ever be able to see. There was no distance between us and it's probably the closest I have felt to having a mother since before I came out. 

I say all this not to detract from your amazing strength in coming out- but hopefully to give you some faith, ironically, that their initial reactions may not be permanent. Imo the shock is almost like grief for some- especially when religion is heavily involved. It's a process they have to work through and getting through it *is* something that's possible even for the ones the most adamant that this is how they feel. So if nothing else please take comfort in that. Even the most devout, dont always let that stand in the way of the love they have from us. They may not understand at first but in time, it Is possible for them to even if some take longer than others. 

Sorry for the long post lol I'm bad about that but reading your post struck home for me and I remember how I felt st the time and wished I had known it was ever possible to regain that bond, I feel it would've helped a lot. So- I felt almost obligated to reach out to you and at least try to offer that hope. I was once told to be the adult I wish I had when I was younger and that had a huge impact on me- so i guess this is just part of that mentality. 

Congratulations, genuinely- wish you well! Stay safe man!"

Some subs have a lot of trolls or trouble makers... some have a lot of just spam or bots..  others have a lot of rulebreajers either purposefully or inadvertently imo all 3 really use different skills, though 1 person may possess all 3 skillsets fine but in general depending on what you're expecting of them in would think has a lot to do for what to u are looking for. 


I stalk profiles, for lack of a better word, like crazy. Specifically their comment history and how they interact with other redditors in general. If you go back a little while most people, myself included, comment as if they arent neccisarily aware that people can actually see those lol so it's a more candid look at their temperament and feelings. Are they argumentative? Are they antagonistic? How do they disagree with people? How do they Express themselves in general? Etc. 
 
Looking st what subs specifically they post often in and the types of comments they leave are imo a good way to get at least a feel for their temperament. 

I also look at how active they are and how old the account is. In my most recent sub I preferred someone who didnt have a new account, as we have a lot of controversial issues and attract a lot more people with mal intent and new accounts suggest to me [while not a gurantee] that it's either not their main account or their main account was banned or deleted indicating behavior probably in conflict with both TOS and our sub rules. I have trust issues in general thoughü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lol

 I also wasnt looking for someone who wasnt very active as we deal with news on a constantly changing subject so if they only are on reddit once every few months likely they wont be as much help moderating as I would like. I also looked for people who already were very interested in the topic and posting materisl/interacting within the sub already in a way that fit within my view of our sub. People who are already fairly active and already taking initiative to post content inline with my goal for the sub probably have an interest in the topic and imo are more likely to actually stay active in the long run and are less likely ro just be in search of ""power"" and trying to mod solely so they can power trip. There definitely are people like that. 


All of this of course in addition to talking with them directly, and seeing how they mesh. Asking them probing questions directly. I personally wanted a well rounded objective mod team. So I tried to seek out people who may disagree with me either politically or ideologically but did so in a way that they could actuslly disagree without blowing up and getting antagonistic. This in an effort to balance out my own inherent bias and make the mod tesn less one sided on those topics. Thsts just because it's something I felt important for the subreddit itself. 

Obviously not all of these will apply or be relevant and kts certainly not an all inclusive list its just what I personally look for when searching for a new mod. Idk if any of this helps or is how everyone does it but it's just what's worked for me.

Keep in mind they dont have to have full permissions at first either so you can start them with limited permission then as time goes on and you get a better feel for them, can give them more access."

The issue clearly is with him, and while he may not even be able to admit it to himself he likely knows this deep down. There is definitely a stigma from some gay men towards bi men. In my case it was because of past experiences that led me to believe that certain behavior was associated with bisexuality that in reality was just associated with that person, I generalized it onto all bi men. I'm not proud of thst but it's taken me a long time to realize that. I also have deep insecurities within myself, and trusting others in general even outside a relationship is extremely hard for me... within a relationship even harder. Add to that struggling with self esteem all my life- I genuinely still find it hard to believe when someone tells me they are ""attracted"" to me and not just saying it because they either think it's what I want to hear or in an effort to get something they want from me. *none of these are logical thoughts though on my part*. But admitting that and ""owning"" that had been something much easier said than done in practice. As others have mentioned this is incredibly toxic both for you and for him. No one deserves to have to walk on eggshells constantly worrying if their partner is gonna flip out over their porn habits etc. Its not ok for him to do this. 

If you love him and truly want to try and work things out tall to him but be bluntly honest about it- even though that honesty likely is going to upset him, t this point the only other option imo is just to leave him. Ultimately this toxic behavior is manifesting from deep problems within him, and not something you can control or cater to unfortunatly. Sorry you're going through this man. Its taken me a very long time to realize this myself even though it's not something one should even have to realize to begin with, and I ultimately have hurt a lot of people I truly cared about in the process. However losing them, and the reality that ultimately I was the reason why, is the only thing that has ironically helped me realize this behavior and attempt to address it
 

Trust is an extremely hard thing to gain once its lost, and if he already doesnt trust you due to his own insecurities imo more than likely thsts something that even addressing it isnt going to be able to fix. If you're not thst invested, I say save yourself.

Its daily tally does not indicate that infections and deaths necessarily occurred in the past 24 hours, but rather that the records were entered into the system during that time period.

Long stays in intensive care and being ventilated are thought to increase the risk, the researchers say.

>Doctors should look out for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery.
Most patients, particularly those with mild symptoms, will not be affected by mental health problems.

>The evidence is based on studies of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well early data on Covid-19 patients.
The researchers, from the UK and Italy, found evidence of confusion and agitation in more than 60% of intensive care patients with Covid in a small number of studies, mostly from China.

>They warned that PTSD could become an issue in some patients, based on the fact that 33% of survivors of Sars and Mers experienced post-traumatic stress more than two years after they were seriously ill.

>There were also frequent reports from these patients of recalling traumatic memories, memory problems, fatigue, insomnia and low mood, during their recovery.
But it is still not clear how the current pandemic will affect people's mental health without more research,¬†the study concludes¬†.

>""Our analysis of more than 3,550 coronavirus cases suggests that most people will not suffer from mental health problems following coronavirus infection"", says Dr Jonathan Rogers from University College London, who co-led the research.
But he warned that delirium - which can cover everything from patients hallucinating and being agitated to sitting completely still - could affect some patients.

>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.

##Interpretation

>If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

Thanks for the link. If they are in fact testing asymptomatic people aswell and *still* not finding any in children... that would be extremely interesting and I think really relevant to us in the US.üßê

Edit according to their data on MOH.gov.sg in not actually seeing any breakdown to determine how many asymptomatic are being tested or how many tested are asymptomatic. Given the fact that most children are asymptomatic I'm hesitant to even imply it may be a seperate strain. Especially knowing that these symptoms in children have now shown up in several different countries in Europe aswell and not just the US specifically however that doesnt exactly rule anything out either. I just would strongly urge anyone to be cautious in making that jump just yet, based solely on the lack of reported cases in children especially of theres no definitive data showing that anyone not showing symptoms is actually being tested. I'll keep looking though I still find it very interesting none the less and the only likely reasoning would be either that something is different there, which could include just the containment in general, or the symptoms havent begun presenting yet. In all countries where these symptoms have shown up in children, it has only done so several months *after* the initial virus shows up and does not appear to present at the same time interval that the more expected symptoms tend to show up in the adults"

The only one that seems to stick out as not familiar to me is the tongue swelling which seems similar to an allergic reaction, which is caused by histamines released by the immune system thus still fitting that same bill.


I wonder if these cases will now be counted separately from the covid cases aswell. Sure seems like another. way-  pure speculation here on my part- to purposefully muddy the waters surrounding the totals and once again give the false illusion we are doing better than we really are , if that turns out to be the case. 


Also curious as the original chinese totals at a noticeable lack of children even though it is irrefutable that children are affected. I doubt we will ever know in less someone leaks info from China, but I wonder if they too kept a seperate tally of children under a seperate name. 


Given the symptoms overlap pretty much entirely and the symptoms are caused by the exact same virus, one just happens to not be as present in the lungs specifically but effectively works the same way it is *extremely concerning* to me that this is being referenced as a completely seperate disease and is something I think peolle definitely should keep a close eye on in the next few months.

>New York City's health department has found 145 cases of children sickened by what was previously referred to as pediatric multi system inflammatory syndrome (PIMS-TS). De Blasio says the city will work under the CDC's latest definition of what it now calls multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) to determine the most accurate case count.

This is important, we assumed it, but they have done additional research to 100 percent confirm it and released a national standard definition,"" de Blasio said Monday.Additional symptoms of the syndrome include persistent fever, irritability or sluggishness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, conjunctivitis, enlarged lymph node on one side of the next, red cracked lips or red tongue, swollen hands and feet, the mayor said.

>Unlike COVID-19, a respiratory disease, MIS-C affects blood vessels and organs and has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock. It involves a ‚Äúhyper response‚Äù of the child‚Äôs immune system to the virus that can lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, and affect the heart‚Äôs arteries, leading to coronary aneurysm.

Past that, you are more than warranted in your opinion on everything  else.  they should be tested, could easily do so and I find it highly unusual that the French Army apparently doesnt agree.

I agree though, it seems it should be fairly easy to cooberate their speculation by giving all that came down with the sickness at the time seroogical testing. Though even that really would only mean that at some point they came into contact with the virus- and not definitively give any evidence as to where they acquired it. Though if  *all* of those members who got sick thst were present all test positive it certainly imo would add more credence to that speculation.  


Though I will point out that specumstion in itself while not proof of anything, is also not proof that it isnt and there is much that on this very subreddit we have speculated about that had turned out to be true. Granted not all of it has, which is the nature of speculation.  Given the anecdotal and circumstantial evidence documented though at the very least, it seems like something that should actually be investigated further and the possibility at least not dismissed entirely. Which is why I personally find it bizarre that the French Army purportedly confirmed that was something they did not want to do. Seems a fairly easy way to dismiss the speculation if nothing else 


It wasnt that long ago that suggesting the virus had appeared before the 2nd week of December was only speculation in itself, but now we know for a fact not only is that true but it was present in several countries already before the 2md week of December.

Ultimately though while a lot can be explained I'm still left with quite a bit I just simply have no rational or logical way to explain away. But yes more just generational dreams but theres also a lot of evidence e for something akin to generational trauma aswell, nd that repeated stress/trauma actually may cause subtle epigenetic changes in mitochondrial dna that then can be passed on to children. So in a broad sense my dreams/anxeity/fears in some way could possibly come from childhood trauma or life trauma my mother experienced at the same age and just be manifesting in odd ways. The science is still extremely limited and most of it would still be considered speculation so that explaining any of my issues would be a reach but the premise itself definitely has always fascinated me.

I think the most logical explanation for all of this is childhood trauma from myself. About 6/7 years ago after suffering most my adolescent and adult life with the symptoms and just not realizing it- I was diagnosed with cPTSD due to real tangible events I went through. There has been some suggestion from a few specialist that I experienced trauma I have completely blocked out around 6-8yo and just have no memory of it, and that is roughly the age that all of this started. The event I talked about above is one of the earliest strange things I cant explain but definitely not the last or the one that has haunted me thse most and especially young minds sometimes have weird ways of dealing with trauma- the night terrors and strange things I used to see could've been me just trying to deal with whatever that trauma was I've since blocked out. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idk lol like I said theough the years I definitely have explored every Avenue of thought to explain them away both rational and even irrational- but even now I cant really say with confidence that one makes more sense over the others."

That exact scene mine your father's actions is a reoccurring nightmare for me and has been for 30+ years now. It is one of my biggest irrational fears as an adult  because of it. I'll be 32 in a month. I was plagued by ""night terrors""  not of them ""waking"" night terrors where I would kind of be awake but still dreaming its hard to explain. This happened up until the age of 11 or 12, this was one of them. Ive continued to have. This is genuinely creepy af to me and I'm sitting here in awe. 

It's never happened to me- hence the irrationality of it. But that description is spot on. I'm at a loss for words. 

I csnt even look through blinds or out windows at night because of it, especially in a storm that is probably the biggest difference it was flashes of lightening revealing the man, and subsequently revealing his eyes at eye level to my own. I  watch a glimpse of the man in the first flash walk to the window to get a better look and on the following flash hes right there on the other side if the window. Those huge eyes and silver skin. Every single time exactly the same.   Just those huge eyes which in my dreams were kind of yellowish/white not just regular eyes and they were huge. Just typing this makes my skin crawl

cvnews,fqxnfm8,t3_glercs,1589735000.0,"This was actually admitted in the very first study done by epidemiologists which actually was presented by China itself even though their narrative seems to have since changed. The lead epidemiologist at the time even quoted in that study that ""the virus may have walked out of that market, but it walked into that market first"" and even as early as January implied that while the first known case at the time may have been infected via the market itself , for that to have happened there had to have already been community spread in Wuhan. This was based mostly on the fact that of the initial 12 patients less than half of them had any connection w it h the market itself, and no connections with each other. The only way this could be possible is if the virus was already circulating in the community surrounding the market. As for the other claims made in the article- alot of them seem to be quite a stretch from the actual informsfion we have and imo definitely seem a bit biased in their assertions.

I definitely get the frustration from that aspect aswell. Exact same issue with the sub I usually crosspost to and fro., solely because it's a fairly new sub that was growing. Granted due to the content in my sub Its probably not as big of a issue as it would be to somethi ng more niche like that. It really does hamper the abil it y to kind of let people know it's there. I wouldnt stress personally about the sub dying - they likely will track down the problem and address it... and the lack of feedback isnt limited to this I know that's something that's been mentioned in quite a few posts on this sub specifically . I like to be optimistic and think it's unintentional and not purposefully keeping anyone in the dark but who knows. Hopefully it's something they get worked out soon though at either rate. As someone who takes pride in my own sub though I definitely get worrying about it- all we can do is try and focus on adding the content manually by submitting links though. In general focusing on the content in the long run imo does the most for helping the sub stay active, imo, even if the daily visitors are down now like they are in my own once xposting is available again hopefully having the consistent quality content still there will pay off for us.

Missing411,fqxflgs,t3_gla18h,1589731532.0,"The little people with the green clothes and caps/(hats?) Makes my hair stand up. I have an memory that involves something very similar I've never shared on reddit though did share once on a different ""conspiracy"" oriented website a few years back. I always thought it was a dream just because of my age at the time was maybe 7 o 8, my mother was there in the ""dream"",  that was until about 5 or 6 years ago I mentioned it one night to my mother who has the same memory and also had been convinced it was just a dream. No one actually went missing so idk if this sub is the best place to share it but long story very short: went walking through the woods with my mother to investigate a light we had seen the night before from our house. The light was red and I guess pulsing? Like the lights on a big tower - only it was definitely close to ground far back in the woods. We had a huge ""wooded"" forst area behind our house st the time.  That is a cllesr memory I have that doesnf feel like a dream. The rest definitely does. 

The next morning and I do remember it being early in the day/shortly after waking up my mother took me with her to walk back just to see if we could find whatever it was. Walking through the woods was not unusual and something we did very often. 

Didnt seem like we alked very far before we came into a huge clearing that looked almost burned and seemed to be in a circle or appeared that way. My mother commented that it must have been a fire or something m but I remember the clearing being quite large. We kept walking and  Ended up crossing through a dry creek bed that she never rememberd seeing before and even after this event in the years after I never was able to find again. [Also another separate story of my sister And her friend involving loss of time in the same creek bed that seemed to not actually be there thst happened a few years later though forsnt involve anything else in this story] there was an old delapedated barn , a wagon type thing falling apart, and 2 grave stones. This was in very rural area of Central Va , so that in itself really isnt as odd as it may sound to some. Then several, the memory is hazy, very small maybe 2 or 3ft tall... beings/creatures/things all walked out of the barn and just stood there looking at us. Mayne 4 or 5 of them?   They were only a few feet tall and I remember them having green clothes or coverings on, and pointed green hats, large round eyes they did not speak or anything and once gathering st the doorway to the barn they just stood there motionless staring at us. The more I try and picture them the last clear the memory really is tbh hence the reason I always assumed it was a dream. I do have a clear image of them standing their looking at us. I don't remember being scared neccisarily but the next memory I have is my mother and I crossing back through the dry creek bed on our way back home. Not running or in a panic or anything, but as one would do once they ""turned back"" after a long walk. 

It seemed like the trip back home took forever though and I remember my mother being concerned that the sun appearsd to be setting so while we werent in a panic to get away from whatever they were - we increasingly were moving more quickly just because she didnt want us to get caught in the woods in the dark. The initial walk in my memory felt ad though we alked maybe. A half an hour or so to get there but to get home it felt like it took us 2 or 3 times that.   It's possible we got turned around and were infact lost and thatd the reason why but that part sticks out to me as much as the rest. I dont have smy other memory after that, never remember actually reaching home or coming out the woods or anything which is another reason I always assumed it was a dream
 

It wasnt until talking with my mother a few years ago that we realized we both had identical memories, hers just as hazey as my own, but the key points were the same. Short walk in, barn old wagon and graves, little creatures dressed in green with green hats, and it taking forever to get back home with no memory of actually reaching home.

Its bothered me off and on most my life and even moreso once realizing it wasnt actually a dream. I even looked on Google earth at the area behind the house where it stands today (we only lived there 5 or 6 more years after that before moving) the trees have since pretty much been clear cut but there is no dry or wet creek bed visible. A school friends family was the one who cut and some the timber- learned in high school after finding out she lived in o ur old house- and I even remember asking if they ever found and old barn or anything without giving more details lol and she doesnt ever remember a structure of any kind. That she was aware of though obviously it could have just been removed without her knowledge. 


This comment ended up being a lot longer than anticipated but reading the description is the closest I've ever heard someone else mention to the description I have in my mind if whatever they were. The only rational explanation is barn owls, and that in misremembering the color and my imagination is adding the hats. Past that I csnt explain anything else in the story rationally especially given my mother's memory being the same . A *lot* of strange memories in that house though , nd that time period of my life but I was so young its hsrs to trust my memory 

Idk if this is at all relevant but just felt urged to share this for some reason. I'll see if I can find the post I made a few years ago if anyones interested with more details, it's a post I made right after discovering that my mom had the same ""dream"" and likely includes a lot more details than I'm remembering now.


If anyone knows a better sub to share a story like this here I'd def be interested in making an actual post, assuming anyone find any of this relevant . I never even considered the ""Fae"" explanation. I had considered false memories, barn owls, aliens or even some type of cryptic though I'm not entirely convinced I believe in any of that I've had too many odd experiences throughout my life to really be able to say I dont believe it. After enough experiences with unexplainable phenomena, its hard not to. As spock always said , logic dictates thst ""when you eliminate the impossible whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth"" and I do try to think logically about stuff like this."

They were aware of the virus when this was ordered- literally the whole world was- they cant exactly feign it was unexpected. This is their fault- they should refund the customer. If they couldnt provide the product they were selling they should have kept the damn business closed instead they capitalized off the pandemic and the fact that krst people would order a delivery product vs buying in a store and failed to uphold their end of the deal. Its purely a dick move on their part. 

I wouldnt stop until I got my.money back- period. If their only option for a refund was more potentially shitty product, absolutely nothing has changed with the virus situation, they should have both stressed they couldnt guarantee to get the actual product there in time aswell as the fact that the customer may be ripped off due to their inability to provide the service they were selling and that if something happened all they would get was more shitty product not an actual refund. 


To imply offering more berries is sufficient is ridiculously absurd.

They are very ""flat"" and all of the leaves face the same direction just like a bearded iris just miniature. The hardest part I had picking them apart was that when actually mixed in with the grass they were nearly indistinguishable. That year though was particularly dry and the grass wasnt nearly as green so amongst the browned grass were little spots of green and that's how I picked them out. 

They also definitely have a rhizome vs a root structure similar to grass however it's very tiny aswell and if the dirt is caked on it's easy to miss. They seem to grow in clumps sporadically though and dont spread in huge swaths or very far from each individual plant. I'm not sure if they spread more by seed- would make more sense because they were fairly evenly spaced. 

I also definitely transplanted a few heft clumps of grass aswell thoughü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è haha they seem to only bloom the once a year I guess and the blooms dont last very long at all but on the one in the picture.

There are a few different forms of this species when looking them up trying to ID them aswell with flowers ranging from blue to purple and most were  slightly larger blooms than this.

cvnews,fqvcv7k,t1_fqvacqr,1589674590.0,"Interesting I'll have to look for the link but I remember before it actually be cane an apparent political issue in the US as it seems to be now, and really before the virus was even admitted to be anywhere other than in Washington state, a news release saying the FDA had approved it for general use specifically mentioning that it was a change from the previous classification of "" for compassionate use"" In relation to offlable uses/conditions it wasnt already approved for. I'm positive that was what the release noted- thoigh sonce it's from memory I definitely could be mistaken about that. It's not uncommon for offlable uses of medications to be labeled as that though and from what I understand is solely because of potential liability issues if they didnt. 

Yes the retinopathy is one of the negative side effects, and from what I remember it's actually reversible either once the medication is stopped or with a seperate treatment. It's been a few months since I looked at the info, though I definitely remember the fact that it was reversible. 


There are also other side effects documented, specifically by the U.S military if I remember correctly again it's been a few months, that I guess are not recognized by the CDC or at least their website. Not just the U.S military other institutions aswell- but since it's been in use so long that in itself wasnt surprising. Most medications do. Most of them seemed generally benign/more an annoyance than anything the one that worried me personally the most were the potential psychological/neurological side effects. The military info didnt specifically mention uust how common they were other than they were ""rare"" but other sources suggested they were far more common than the US govt and military admitted.thst info was speculated in the lawsuits of service members at the time against the U.S U.S thay as far as I could tell ultimately all ended in settlements with the details of those settlement and outcomes not released to the public. 

From my memory Those effects included auditory and visual hallucinations, seizures , depression, and suicidal/homicidal thoughts among others - and seemed to always be listed as ""rare"" however it was interesting that all the other side effects gave an average % of how often they were seen whereas the psychological/neurological effects on every single sight visited the % was always left blank or not referenced.  Just being conspiracy minded, at ths time I thought that was interesting. The mod team here talked abo it it a lot in our mod chat before the virus was even acknowledged I  the U.S soley because the original studies from Wuham that came out starting in January [you can find them by searching the clinical characteristics of patients in Wuhan, in this sub. We published at least the first 4 or 5 - up to the first 100k or so patients] mentioned that HCQ , along with remdesivir, were both given to the initial patients documented. 

There was a rash of suicides documented in social media videos that came out of Hubei in late January and early February that were truly disturbing and one of the possible explinations- in addition to just emotional trauma of being bolted and welded into their apartments by the CCP- were side effects of some of the medications being used, which led me on the search. I have never heard of it before then personally though have 2 family.members who have taken itm 1 was given it in desert storm by the U.S military and he ended up experiencing horrible side effects from it though that's just anecdotal and could've been due to the trauma of way- but matches the info I found regarding the psychological side effects. My aunt has Lupus though and takes it for that. Though I guess ultimately irrelevant lol just thought it was interesting.

That is very interesting to me personally though that the CDC only acknowledges the vision issues- I remember there being many more though for the most part most were relatively mild and likely the benefits of using for a disease that it was confirmed to be a treatment for would outweigh those negatives but the more severe ones definitely seemed concerning. I remember we talked about the fact that even if the chance of negative effect were low, hypothetically  using the 1% range, that once scaled up to the population that would need it for covid that 1% would equal a troubling amount of people. We compared it to the Relstivemy low CFR of the virus being 3.8% which also seems small but when scaled up, equaled a disturbing amount of people. 

There was not definite tie between the suicides that werent ever acknowledged by the chinese government, and the treatments specifically FWIW that was purely speculation here trying to explain them, and no scientific link... it's just what led me personally kn the search for potential side effects of the drugs administered and how I learned about HCQ in early February.  


Thanks for linking the CDC info on it though- like I said I definitely find it curious that's the only side effect mentioned there. Just a quick search, because it's been used for so long, shows quite a few other organizations listing a lot more than just the retina damage so again curious that the CDC would omit those on its website- but I'm no professional so I'm sure they have a reason why they felt it wasnt necessary to not include them, or didnt find it necessary to include them anyways.

GardenWild,fquyjq3,t3_gl317q,1589666495.0,"When I first moved into the house I'm in , it had been vacant for nearly 5 or 6 years after a foreclosure. The previous owner was either a botanist of some kind or just an avid collector of plants. It makes me sad on one hand to know she had to leave so many gorgeous gems- but it's been unexpected find after unexpected find so many mature and naturalized plants. Granted many had long gone from their original borders, a lor non of shrubs choked out by invasives etc. 

Well in the side yard there is a large sunny patch of ""weeds"" as the neighbors called it. It hadn't been mowed st all in several years judging by the saplings that had started to root everywher. For someone like myself who ascribes to the ""garden wild"" mentality I was ecstatic lol I've always wanted a meadow/prairie and it seems like it was on it's way- sadly the HOA didn't agree that it was useful and after trying to bend the rules ultimately most had to be cut down. 

So before I did, I walked through a few hundred times looking for natives or little gems that had self seeded out if other areas. There were wild geraniums everywhere, black eyed Susan, virginia spiderwort, ferns and even some brown eyed Susan near the shady edges. Blanket flowers and 4 or 5 different types of coreopsis along with a lot of grasses and sedges.   I very methodically started to dig up small patches and move to a 4ft by 30ft. Border on the side yard that I surrounded with wooded edging. According to the HOA. I could only have flowers or anything over 6 inches within a border, and that border could be no wider than 4ft... however they didnt technically have a regulation for how long, so I made it stretch the entire yard. That's the backstory to this little gem.

So when I first visited the property before moving in it was early spring and nothing had wuite.bloomed but it was full of little.blue flowers just being swarmed by little bees - it was something I had never seen so I was excited but by the time I moved in.. I couldnt find them anywhere. When digging up the ones I could have-  I kept seeing little clumps of grass that didnt quite look like grass. It was very grass like but more like a mini iris. I took a gamble and dug up a few clumps - hoping thsts what had been.blooming. 

The last 2 years- it never bloomed. It never really spread and didnt seem invasive but I just assumed whatever the flower I had seen was had been lost. 


Cue about 20 minutes ago I caught s little glimpse of something out the corner of my eye in my wildflower patch. Sure enough IT BLOOMED!!!  The flowers are so tiny, less than the size of a dime! Gently purched on the tips of blades of ""grass like"" foliage. After finally taking a picture and a little research I finally have a name. I feel like a geek being so excited over something so small, but it is indeed a native here. I'm so glad I saved it. It's likely still present in the side yard but unfortunatly having to trim it its indistinguishable from grass.


This may not be the best subreddit for this so if not I'm sorry- but bbecsuse I kept it for the wildlife value I thought maybe it would fit.

The data is available- several studies on this very subreddit. 


Not sure why those facts make you angry bit I assure you I dont care that it does-

You're the only one making claims about its effectiveness  not in the article specifically or in any actual scientific studies I have seen or been able to find...  that burden is not on me to prove you wrong. Nor are you entitled to me arguing with you simply because you want someone to argue with. It doesnt work based on the ample data that is available - and  there are no scientific studies showing it does work with am accurate sample size or control group. There are people that have speculated based on everything from ""hunches "" to anecdotal evidence that they allegedly have seen... thst is the reason the studies were done solely to prove those hunches and anecdotal evidence right or wrong, it just happens that all of the science available says the same thing and that is that there does not appear to be any improvement of symptoms nor decrease in death rate when used on patients with covid. 

As for the side effects- a quick search will show you solely because the medicine *has* been around that on a patient without covid there *are* negative side effects however the benefits ti patients with lupus outweigh the negative risks. Thst is status quo for medications. In patients with covid , according to studies that were stopes due to the negstive side effects, it appears that those already present side effects are increased significantly. 

You're welcome to believe anything you like- you're entitled to your opinion regardless of whether that opinion is based on all of the facts.... or just someone's hunch. You do you. 

Hel, If you want to take it yourself no one is stopping you- though I definitely personally wouldnt advise it without talking to a health professional who likely will tell you the same. 
 
Nor is anyone forcing you to believe the data clearly laid out in this specific post or any of the studies available within this subreddit, if you dont want to take the time to look at thst information- again that's on you.


If you dont want to believe the Information that is something you are more than entitled to not believe. Being antagonistic is pointless though because I assure you- I have no intention of letting this back and forth devolve any further into a pointless argument that I genuinely dont care about

That is the reason it was mlm only approved for compassionate use outside of a very limited scope until our FDA in the UnS overruled that. 

Anecdotal evidence suggested it may be a viable treatment- however the actual studies have shown repeatedly over and over thatd just simply not the case u fortunately. 

Granted we knew that in February already, as it had already been used on patients by that point and the placebo was shown to have a better positive effect than the drug itself. But because some people questioned it, we wasted the valuable time doing more clinical trials just to make sure the original studies werent flawed which in itself really isnt a bad thing to do especially because we still have no know treatment for the virus, though imo we could've better spent that time studying other treatments which we didnt already have evidence of not working but thsts neither here nor there I guess. 

Ultimately this study, like the handful of ones already done and completed also showed, it simply ismt a viable treatment. I wish that simply *wanting* it to be made it so- unfortunatly that's just not the way reality works. One study showing this could be debated, 2 studies is a little harder to debate, this point though multiple studies done by multiple countries independently all coming to the same conclusion- and it should be pretty clear to everyone now.

That is *why* Joe Biden is in the position he is in, to make sure he *earns* enough votes to beat him. He simply doesnt have a choice- hell the world cant afford 4 more years if trump.  That's *why* Jor Biden needs to get his shit together and make sure he appeals to the widest swath of voters. Thst pressure is *not* on mr and idc what kind of vile rhetoric is thrown my way- I can play the same game and throw it right back but ultimately it does not change the fact that it is up to *Joe Biden* to earn enough votes. 


If he is so mother fucking ""electable"" then this really shouldnt be that hard. I'm not Bernie or bust... I am principal or bust. If Joe Biden appeals to me as a voter I have no problem voting for him even though I think hes a slimy character. I dont have to like someone to concede their ability to do a job this is solely about him appealing to the principals I stand for. Tje DNC chose to position him as a frontrunner.
