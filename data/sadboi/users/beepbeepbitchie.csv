I am an extremely sensitive person, always have been and probably always will be, but I feel like I’m not a happy person. I don’t really recall much reassurance in life, I’ve always felt (even as a child) that something is wrong with me and I’ll never be good enough, but trying to figure it out on my own has basically felt like I’m running around in circles getting absolutely nowhere. I don’t know what my soul’s true nature is. 

I appreciate you taking the time to look at my chart though, I’m sorry it got cropped but hopefully the link works now."
