StarWars,fqm0a77,t3_gjlabo,1589469270.0,"One of my favourite visual designs from the Disney era. Totally looks like a droid some ambitious Imperial industrial designer would cook up -- imposing, vaguely skeletal, with that mildly hunched over posture to make it both predatory and pathetic, like the burden of being a worker robot has slightly crushed its spine but it's always ready to pounce on someone. It's taller than the average human and looks like it might have some armour plating incorporated, so run of the mill Imp grunts won't be tempted to kick it around and damage it for fun/stress relief. The facial ""expression"" looks kind of... focused, kind of goofy. Its proportions are sort of gangly, but at the same time clearly the thing could reach out from far away and break your neck, and those legs could propel it after you if you do wrong by the Emperor. Its overall vibe is a big, physically and socially awkward older brother who is very loyal to family but always seems on the verge of flipping out and murdering everyone in the room.

It's good! Props to whoever came up with this design IRL."

B) severely simplify/reduce the scale of the setting (the ""city"" is only a few blocks wide), or...

patientgamers,fmwkli8,t3_fx2ulk,1586448255.0,"Barriers to me finishing a long game:

1) Increasing complexity leads to too much micromanaging and drudgery. Mostly happens with strategy and sim games. Too many elements to keep track of. Progress slows. Good games provide some automation elements to reduce this. Mods can help.  But some games have inherently empty/disappointing end-games where it becomes way more trouble than it's worth. Thinking of ""Spore"" here mostly.

2) Bad UI that gets increasingly frustrating. Maybe easy to ignore when you start out and you're still figuring out how the whole game works, figuring out ""loops"" and routines and efficiencies. But as time goes by, you end up *dreading* how long it takes to open a sub-sub menu, etc. You know exactly how all the elements work, how to go about doing what you're supposed to do, but you end up hating *how long* it takes to accomplish any of these things. 

3) Single player games where you can see/feel the narrative wrapping up and you know it's going to be a let-down. This is probably pretty hard for designers to tackle, so I'm a little more understanding. But if you front-load a game with lots and lots of characters and dialogue, lots of side-quests and customization and intra-team relationship dynamics, and then the last 3rd of the game becomes completely focused on Doing That One Thing and all those tangents get dropped and never called back to, I as a player end up feeling that sting of futility and regret.

You want a society of mediocre, shallow dullards, that's how you do it.

Stuff like this burns my biscuits, man."
MovieSuggestions,fhwr1ia,t1_fhwefv6,1581926120.0,One of the best movies about loneliness ever made. Emotionally devastating!
socialskills,fhkb0xg,t1_fhk550f,1581675659.0,There's a lot to be said for knowing *for sure* that someone isn't into you. Really lets you focus on other things -- and other people.

AskScienceFiction,fhi2yuj,t1_fhhxj0u,1581616784.0,"""Existentialism"" is a big, nebulous movement/school of thought. From my university days, Nietzsche was usually described as a precursor more than a ""proper"" existentialist, same as, for instance, Kierkegaard."
AskScienceFiction,fhh020e,t1_fhgzsko,1581587287.0,"I remember that being the prevailing (fan-created?) idea before the AvP movies and last two Scott-directed ones. Now it's all messed up. Now they're... kind of an accident (*Prometheus*), but also created by an android (*Prometheus 2: The Prometheoning*)?"
AskScienceFiction,fhgxopy,t1_fhg0gi0,1581583943.0,"They reproduce quickly, they're great at killing stuff, and they're super-aggressive (rapacious). But wouldn't they completely wipe out everything they eat (mammals? birds? fish?) if dropped on a Earth-like planet in sufficient numbers and then starve themselves to death? Doesn't seem like long-term survival at all.

Then again I can't remember seeing one of these aliens actually eat something for sustenance. What the heck *do* they eat?"
OkCupid,fhgwm1p,t1_fhg7ewf,1581582435.0,"Yeah, never been a fan of, ""If they're doing \[obviously bad thing\], then I should get to do \[obviously bad thing\] too!"""

truegaming,fhgmexj,t1_fhg1ffd,1581571308.0,"I've run into that problem on PC versions of Skyrim and Fallout 4. Inevitably, you have to mod the game to make it work the way it was supposed to. Bethesda!"
AskScienceFiction,fhc2i9v,t1_fhask3k,1581454889.0,"Well, the Kingdom has ""armor"". Like a solitary chest pad most of the time. Which is great for establishing a uniform aesthetic for your security forces, but not much use against zomboes unless they're going straight for your nips.

>!The comics introduces an advanced settlement much later on in the story that has really good-looking and effective armor, and the three big settlements also start equipping their security/caravans with practical anti-zombo coverings. !<

I'm guessing in general the priority on the TV show goes to a) comfort for actors in hot/humid environments, b) staying within budget, and c) providing visual distinctiveness to individual characters and allowing actors to do their acting without helmets or face masks getting in the way."
AskScienceFiction,fh7b2ds,t1_fguk0h2,1581322658.0,"Also status/rank, reputation/face, and favors/cronyism can still exist without money. If there's any kind of limited resource, be it wine, living space, or seats at a one-time-only stage performance, that resource gets distributed according to these other, older models."
AskScienceFiction,fh78a38,t1_fh3nf29,1581319074.0,"Can Geralt get fat? I've only seen him roaming around working job to job, swinging that sword around, sometimes fist-fighting for cash, not really pampering himself very often. What happens if he settles down for the witcher equivalent of a desk job with high-calorie, high-carb food and drink?"
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fh21dye,t1_fh17vxv,1581231038.0,They don't. That good guy shit is a story they tell their grandmas. They know and all their buddies know you get into that business for the violence and the power.
Shadowrun,fgraoq3,t1_fgps56w,1581042223.0,Might be appropriate for a very low-level scumbum start-from-nothing game where everyone is a ganger or petty criminal.
bestof,fggkcv1,t1_fgfoj0i,1580763675.0,"I try not to think about death too often, but I have thought it would be nice to have an omniscient authority figure absolutely, conclusively tell me whether or not I was ""the asshole"" throughout my whole life after I die. I guess if there's a bad place for assholes, and I end up there, well, that's not great, but just for a moment it would be an amazing relief to know for absolutely sure just how much of a prick I really was."
askTO,fgfch9o,t1_fgaetl5,1580734406.0,"Ah, Labour Ready! I've worked for them in another city in Ontario. Grim but reliable. The office I went to had black ceiling tiles for some reason. I worked with a lot of guys who did time in prison.

Haven't looked at them in Toronto. I was kind of hoping they'd have a wider variety of work than smaller cities. Industrial work, construction, etc. But I suppose snow is fine too.

I worked for a similar temp company in TO many, many years ago. Briefly got work through them in a meat factory. It was... interesting. Can't remember the name of that temp company."

BoJackHorseman,fg6stzo,t1_fg6pz6c,1580576078.0,"The end stretch of her show-long arc was interesting but suffered from the highly-compressed format of the back-half's structure. Would have been great if more time was spent on her whole mental health/professional writer journey, but alas there was only so much time to spend on everyone."
BoJackHorseman,fg6s855,t1_fg69453,1580575689.0,"Yeah I like how if there is point or a lesson it's not so much that people can change or will change or never change, but really that we should at least allow the opportunity for change and maybe have some patience and not be too surprised when someone fucks up and be prepared for that, and also it's fine to say ""I'm out"" and walk away because all that patience and opportunity for change has a cost, and there are consequences and there's lasting damage, and you sometimes you gotta take care of yourself while presumably someone else is taking care of themselves *a la* Hollyhock walking away, which imo was super fair and highly advisable from her pov."
