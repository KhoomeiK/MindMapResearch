depression,erb59am,t1_erb4vhj,1560662332.0,"Oh geez, well I started out doing things I‚Äôd normally do with a friend or another person. These things can be going to an art museum, listening to new songs, watching shows/movies you‚Äôve never seen before, reading books/going to the library. In honesty, being your own friend is discovering who you are wholly. Oh and hey, the first step towards being your own friend is to accept being alone most of the time because being alone is inevitable. Also, I‚Äôm sure with time, you‚Äôll meet new friends that‚Äôll be there by your side because I know I did :D"
depression,erb4swc,t1_erb4ib3,1560661823.0,"well, hey!! That‚Äôs a start and you may make new friends that way! But speaking from past experience, I‚Äôm someone who grew up with practically no friends during my elementary school years. Boi will I admit was it lonely, but it inevitably brought me to meet the friends I have today. If anything, friends during your high school years won‚Äôt matter as much especially since most friendships during that time eventually fade. So, if the off chance you don‚Äôt make new friends, my word of advice would be to be your own friend. Being your own friend helps a lot especially since you won‚Äôt feel lonely because you‚Äôll wholly be content with yourself. As with time, you‚Äôll eventually meet new friends along the way."

depression,erb3z5x,t3_c168mu,1560660903.0,"OK, LISTEN!!! Those type of friends you just mentioned don‚Äôt deserve you. If anything, it‚Äôs probably a good thing they stopped hanging out with you because now you know they‚Äôre not meant to be your friend and you can move on from them. Think of it this way, you never know when you‚Äôll meet new friends who‚Äôll be the light in your life. Also, brownie points if you become your own best friend! Oh and hey, you mentioned it‚Äôs summer break for you, maybe you should find some new hobbies like drawing, playing some new games, or even pick up an instrument because the possibilities are endless."
