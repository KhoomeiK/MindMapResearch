Paranormal,fqzlhzt,t1_fqz3oqu,1589769860.0,"I looked more into it and am a health care professional— when it comes to psychology of memory and childhood development— or even memory of humans in general— human beings have a surprisingly accurate recall regarding traumatic events, terrifying experiences, significant minor details even stick out in the human mind. Typically the human memory on average and under normal circumstances is actually very unreliable. Trauma and terror tend to be some of the most accurate— me just speculating on these general themes in research findings, I think it has to do with survival. It makes sense for humans of all ages to remember dangerous events in order to help protect themselves in the future. It’s super interesting if you google it! It’s incredibly fascinating! Here’s another example— I rocked back in my chair when I was like 5 or 6 and had severe head trauma— needed ER care and Staples— I remember I was eating a bologna sandwich just before I rocked back to far and hit the floor. The human mind is so bizarre sometimes."

She came up to us from ER and being the charge nurse, I wanted to help my one coworker who was drowning— I got the new patient settled and then as I was doing her admission, I found out she needed to be tested. One week later she came back positive, and I was told since I didn’t have any PPE and had mild symptoms, I needed to quarantine get tested. I’m just nervous if my results come back negative that everyone at work will be mad at me.. I don’t know if it’s even rationale to feel that way, but I’m just scared because I was the one who made a “stink” about the hospital needing to tell me if the patient had come back positive or not. I had to do the work on my own because no one was checking on the status—despite me letting management know I was exposed without PPE. I just feel bad because I know other coworkers of mine probably have COVID19, but aren’t allowed to be tested unless they have a high fever and shortness of breath or a high fever and a cough.

There’s definitely limitations with UV-C light waves that should not be ignored, but with the proper environment, right distancing/ positioning of equipment to the light source, and correct amount of time given considering the microbe— about 30 minutes of exposure is best for retroviruses that contain protein envelopes surrounding  and protecting the RNA— since the protein viral envelope will need to be denatured by the ionizing radiation—
Think of it like a walnut with a hard outer shell that needs extra strength to be cracked open, to get to the inside. It’s kind of like that.

UV-C definitely has a role in decontamination in the medical field, but limitations need to be taken into consideration as this could provide a false sense of thinking something is sterilized but oh no one knew about the c-diff spores that will now infect the new person that UV won’t work on."

White guilt is like “I’m sorry for the fucked up historical events and current racist events that are happening that were/ are caused by white people.” Calling someone pathetic because of a feeling they have is just straight up aggressive and rude. It can feel incredibly horrible to see people who you know you are grouped with naturally by others, saying and doing toxic shit— when it’s something that you know is wrong. It makes you want to let others know you acknowledge the problematic shit, and you dont want to be associated with it. I think it’s a lot how you phrase it. Like I’m a woman and if a guy said “most guys are bad, sorry for how bad most guys are” comes off self deprecating versus “wow, women have to deal with a lot of bullshit. I’m a guy, and I know I will never fully experience all the crap you have to go through, but it makes me ashamed of my gender sometimes because I know people that don’t know me might assume I’m like that and I feel like I have to do extra work to prove to people I don’t say and do said toxic behaviors.” Totally different how it comes across to me."

You know?” And I’m like “Well Dr. Kumar is from India and becoming a doctor with English as your first language is hard, but imagine how super smart he must be because English is his second language AND he still went to med school and become a successful doctor!”.

You’re racist for bringing up race!” Or similar phrases is, “there’s this misconception that being colorblind is considered equality, however it vastly fails to acknowledge the additional hurdles and struggles POC and other marginalized groups have to deal with. If we are to actually advocate for human rights and equality, then the best thing we can do is try and hear out other minority groups in order to educate ourselves about the challenges they face that you and I are not exposed to. That’s why it’s called privilege, because we have the privilege to ignore those struggles others face because we literally don’t have them, while they get no choice as whether or not to know about said struggles as they are the ones facing those struggles”. 

Usually it works because I try to draw a connection if the person is part of some marginalized group (doesn’t usually work if it’s a rich white heteronormative guy) “you’re a white woman/ gay person/ person of color/ person with disabilities/ person with low-income etc. you know we face different challenges than rich white men— it’s the same with any marginalized group”.

trashy,fj0hnxo,t3_fanq4b,1582900197.0,"I wish no one ever had unwanted pregnancies in the first place :( I do find it violating she filmed the other couple. Also I know people are like “just a clump of cells” okay but also I don’t care who you are or what your beliefs may be, but the stress of having an abortion or even finding out you’re pregnant IS in itself stressful. I’m not saying she should be crying or upset, but the decision is stressful whether it’s related to your religious beliefs, the physical pain that comes with abortion (yes even the pill causes major painful cramping—people should read first account experiences—especially if you’re acting like the procedure is no biggie), or the financial costs associated with getting an abortion. 

I am pro-choice and a medical professional, but I grew up in a Catholic heavy pro-life culture. Pro-choice is so important because without access to safe abortions, women still seek abortion but through unsafe means—causing a lot of unnecessary harm and a lot of times death to the woman AND the fetus. Pro-choice is the only option I see as making sense because the decision to terminate a pregnancy should really be something discussed between a woman and a doctor. Every situation is different and making blanket laws banning abortion doesn’t take into consideration the many diverse reasons people seek abortion. Even so, if you aren’t prepared to have a baby and just like sex, you shouldn’t be forced to give birth, especially due to the US having THE HIGHEST mortality rate of mothers and babies out of all first world countries. Giving birth is still dangerous, while getting an abortion is known to be one of the safest procedures with the  one of lowest mortality rate out of medical procedures. No woman should be forced to give birth, that’s just so incredibly fucked up. If it was men who carried the pregnancies and giving birth, you’d see such a difference in attitudes. 

I have helped women deliver healthy babies and have seen the beauty and happiness it can bring, but I have also seen the immense suffering of newborn infants withdrawing from heroin and their mothers not able to take care of the babies (let alone themselves). The world is not black and white, and abortion or giving birth is too complex of a decision to try and make it into a black and white issue. The Pro-life movement is extremely flawed due to the lack of support for women once babies are born, lack of support for birth control which would prevent an abortion in the first place, lack of support for rape/ incest survivors, and lack of support for complex medical conditions. Oh and also the fake medical information used as propaganda.  

Yes, I can critique the pro-life movement as I myself used to be so passionately pro-life that I’ve gone to the pro-life annual DC protest before. 

Here is what made me pro choice: becoming a nurse and learning more about complex medical situations, historically accurate information of what happened when abortions were illegal, learning accurate medical information and realizing many of the shock images and “facts” displayed by pro-lifers are false and made up with the rationale of “the end justifies the means”, discovering how many “pro-life” people don’t actually give two shits about the lives of women and would rather a woman die than get an abortion because if they were going to get an abortion then they deserve to die, the lack of responsibility put on men for unwanted pregnancies, the view that the woman “should be forced to give birth” as a punishment for having sex out of wedlock. No one will say it directly, but it is heavily implied. “They shouldn’t have had sex if they knew they could get pregnant” okay but what about men? Where is there punishment? There isn’t. 

I understand there are people in the pro-life movement that do sincerely care about the baby and woman after birth, and that think abortion should be allowed in certain cases, but from what I’ve seen, that’s maybe about half the people or less than half who are pro-life. I found the pro-life DC march incredibly disturbing even as a pro-life person at the time."

In addition, you are taking up a societal resource aka law enforcement for no reason, potentially delaying response or back up to an ACTUAL emergency.

Also Wellbutrin. They also have a section showing side effects and how to know if a drug is working. There are other non-pharmaceutical options though for treatment resistant depression— they list those as well; from lifestyle stuff for MILD depression - exercise and light therapy— to Severe depression like TMS and ECT (which is like super rare and heavily stigmatized due to how it was originally used plus Hollywood; but actually has like a super super amazing success rate but only for depression. Like practically 100% )

Also it’s really taboo of me to suggest this; but there’s a lot of recent new interest in PTSD treatment with psychedelics— more specifically magic mushrooms. (It’s like low key research hush hush, but literally all prior research and current research shows really high success rates with intermittent dosing of psychedelics). Basically, you’re with a doctor and a therapist and are 100% supervised as you go through therapy sessions reviewing the traumas and successfully working through them. I’ve seen it suggested once a year to once a week for 4 weeks then once a year for maintenance for like a couple years— it’s still getting researched but we all have high hopes of it being successful in the medical community with all the positive results we’ve been seeing.

toastme,fipfs5j,t1_fipeb0s,1582605683.0,"Anytime! Sorry for the novel! In my mind I’m like “all of this is important!” (Thanks ADHD)I’m going to send you a couple links of recent research for treatment resistant depression anyways. Seriously though, if you are switching medications— (even if it’s hormone related), it’s common for docs to rx some anti anxiety meds to help ease the process. Call up your doctor’s office and tell the front desk people to pass the message to your doc if you can’t speak to your doc directly, tell them you’re struggling, ask for something for anxiety (even though it’s more depressive symptoms); it’s the right “trigger” word for the doc to rx Ativan/ Xanax/ Klonopin as needed. In addition, if you get the chance and only if you feel comfortable with it; It would be helpful as well to know what meds and treatments you’ve done in the past that haven’t worked, and also diagnosis. There’s a big difference between treating Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar, Generalized anxiety Disorder, Hormonal Disorder, etc. They can all create similar symptoms, but all have different processes and treatments."
toastme,fipauqg,t3_f90hj1,1582602027.0,"You are amazing and strong and I’m proud of you for fighting so hard. It can seem endless and hopeless at times, and it takes so much courage and strength to deal with the pain of depression and anxiety. Please do not give up hope. Please keep fighting till you are able to find a medication or treatment that helps you. 

I grew up battling depression and raised my little brother because my dad was an alcoholic and my mom has narcissistic personality disorder. I suffered for years, was locked in my room or left on the side of the road by my parents if I ever had a panic attack. I wanted the pain to stop so badly, but I just kept hoping and waiting for the day I could get help. At 23 years old, my life actually began. I found a doctor who started me on Paxil, and I went from bad grades, severe social anxiety, panic attacks and major depression— to my actual self. I’m a social butterfly, I went to school and became a nurse, I live in an apartment now with my amazing partner and our two cats. I still have off days, but it was life changing. 

Point being, I wish I had known what my life would be like now, so I could have gotten help sooner. I’m not my mental illness, and neither are you. Please please, I know it’s so hard to even get help— it took me years once I moved out, but things can be better. You don’t even realize how horrible your everyday mental illness is until you feel relief. My god it’s life changing. I sincerely want you to know you are important. You’re a stranger to me, and I to you, but I sincerely do care and don’t want you to harm yourself. You’re a beautiful young woman, and I know in my heart things can change dramatically for the better. Reading other stories from other people like us who have recovered and live beautiful happy lives always gave me hope. In the same sense, I want to give you the same hope others gave to me. You’re not alone sweetheart. Sending you my love. If you ever have any questions about mental health, or treatment options, please do not hesitate to message me. I often work with people who have attempted suicide, working hard to stabilize them and working hard to hear them. To let them know I’ve been in that dark place too, but it doesn’t have to stay that way. 

You are beautiful 
You have meaning
You deserve a happy life
You are strong
You are damn resilient, don’t you ever forget that.

Edit for you: Not sure of the current health services or treatments you’ve tried or are currently trying, but I can help you at any stage. You don’t know where to start? I can tell you. Your doctor not working? I can help direct you on how to advocate for yourself to see a specialist or how to find a good doctor. Medication not working? Weird side affects that make you not want to take a med? Feel free to ask and talk to me about it. No health coverage and needing a free clinic? I know how to find them. I’m being 100% serious. I’ve done this for people on reddit and for friends/family/people I barely know. I do it for my patients even staying past my 12 hour shifts—clocked out; researching and educating them because at the end of the day, their success and recovery means everything to me. Sorry for the lengthy post, I just worry a lot about people :( I just want you to be okay."

FragileMaleRedditor,fim30pn,t1_file2gl,1582516780.0,"People that bring up male suicide stats don’t even know what they’re talking about. Men have higher SUCCESS rates of suicide specifically because methods chosen by men are more violent— firearms/ hanging. Women have higher over all rates of attempted suicide, but succeed less often because women are more likely to use pills or cutting to bleed out— which can be treated in a hospital if found in time. Most people committing suicide don’t want to die, they just want the pain to stop. If pills are taken, both men and women will sometimes attempt to get emergency help after.

Source: RN who regularly stabilizes critical care patients— including failed suicide attempts. 
And holy crap you would be shocked at the ways people try to kill themselves. Like Tylenol.. not that I would ever want someone to commit suicide but dear god whatever you do, don’t choose Tylenol.

Tinder,fim1s05,t1_fim076f,1582515855.0," No I agree completely. I don’t know why people do stuff like that. I guess the reason it makes me upset is because I feel there’s a lot of consequences for the woman like your choices are pushing a small human out of yourself or getting an abortion which no matter what, pill or minor surgery— both are physically painful.  The pill basically makes you “miscarry” which your body does all the same contractions as birth, just toned down. Also male condoms don’t change the pleasure for women— or at least not for me or any other women I know, so like the choice not to use a condom is usually the guy. It just doesn’t seem fair in the end because the woman is the one who is marked with the shame of a physical pregnancy, and then are continually made fun of and shamed for being single young mothers. Like I don’t blame people for not wanting to be with a partner who has children— I wouldn’t, but it’s just shitty that so much of the shame and hardship goes to the woman, when both the man and woman where the ones being irresponsible."

Tinder,fikxm8i,t3_f8aue0,1582489212.0,"Eww it’s totally the same for men too— but in a different way. Usually young single dads will show off their kids to try and look like a somewhat involved father but actually are a deadbeat dad that sees their kids once a year or I’ve met men that pretend they don’t have a kid. 

These guys are the worst, the old “jizz and run” kind of man who will whine and complain that condoms just don’t “feel as good” and he has to “cum inside you because it feels the best that way” then when they get a woman preggy, it’s like “oopsie poopsie!” Then they break up with the girl because she wants him to step the fuck up, but he’s not about that life—but also he is a believer in the lord, so he still wants the girl to give birth to their baby because it’s a blessing from god. Then the woman is left taking care of the new baby and he’s jobless or spending his money on booze and partying— the cycle usually repeats until he goes to jail for something or actually gets married."

TheRightCantMeme,fhl9cxt,t1_fhjlee5,1581697400.0,"I think it would be super beneficial though to keep up minimum wage with the rate of inflation. When it comes down to it, we are always going to need people to fill service positions. I just feel like people who work full time should be able to afford basic life amenities. In addition, a lot of economic theory used by CEOs have changed a lot since the 70s. More focus is put on shareholders where previously it was put on employees. Think Henry Ford who upped the pay of his workers and started the Saturday and Sunday weekend trend. He paid his workers higher so they could afford to buy his cars and gave them time off so they could have leisure time, increasing production due to workers being more well rested and ready for the work week. I’d like seeing CEOs start to trend back towards this. Or maybe a mixture of the two types of theories. It would really benefit companies more in addition to production and average quality of life for many Americans."
TheRightCantMeme,fhjkhuc,t1_fhggn9a,1581648449.0,"Really? I know some plumbers that make a really good amount of money— trade jobs are badly needed. However, from what I’ve researched into different trades (my bf was considering becoming an electrician); it took a couple years of trade school, and then depending on the trade, another 2 to 4 years of basically “interning” and working underneath another certified trade person— which yes! Is paid! But typically not much. Not sure what laws are in your area but in MI you have to have a state license and graduate from trade school. 

I actually am a huge supporter for trades because trade schools tend to be cheaper and shorter than some degrees— plus allow people to live a middle class life. The working poor tend to be single women with children who don’t have time or the resources to go to trade school. Who’s gonna pay for it? What about the extra costs of child care if they are working and trying to go to classes? It would be super beneficial to set up programs for to help those kind of families. Like we should try and empower people to help them help themselves out of poverty. 

Also a lot of those low paid jobs are not easy. Before I finished nursing school, I was an patient aid at a memory care unit taking care of no joke up to 20 demented elderly people who were pretty much all incontinent, unable to brush their teeth, get dressed, shower without help, some unable to even eat. I also did their laundry and served them their food in the dining room. THAT was the absolute hardest physically I’ve ever worked in my life. Would walk a total of 8 miles  in a shift, had to deal with constant lack of resources and angry patients/ family, take care of medical emergencies— deciding whether or not they needed to be sent out to the hospital. Made $8 an hour back in 2015. Gave me a new outlook and I try to think back now that I’m a nurse and making more money, about all the amazing hard working patient caregivers who work 60 hours a week to feed themselves and their kids. Oh and no health insurance for them! Managers would mix hours and do shady crap to make people just short of having enough hours in one week to count for a full time worker. They’d short hours all the time, it’s super illegal and people don’t have the money or knowledge or time to try and fight it."
TheRightCantMeme,fhgd69u,t3_f2xf0n,1581564140.0,Do people actually recognize that most poor Americans DO work 40 or more hours a week? Like what the hell?! I literally know people that have kids and work two to three jobs to try and support their families.

I did not grow up around poor conservatives, but I worked and paid for my own college so I met a lot of poor conservatives in my early 20’s— mainly the type with bridge cards and on welfare who constantly complained about lazy people on welfare but they themselves were the exception. I get the “they took our jerbs” more in the sense of the automotive factory jobs being outsourced to other plants in Mexico. I grew up in Michigan and automotive companies make up a large part of our economy here. My mom was an electrical engineer who worked for Ford and taught me unions were bad because union workers are lazy and they can’t ever fire them, and my dad was a chemical engineer— but then went and became a patent lawyer.

I think the main issue is the amount of lobbying and money that goes into certain interests that are not often good for a majority of people— like I know people that get all weird about welfare and stuff and they are literally on welfare themselves but they see themself as the exception. They support the Tea Party and stuff which was legitimately created by the Koch brothers to help convince working class people to go against their own best interests. Every poor working class conservative that fights against their own interests view themself as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire versus an actual impoverished person who will most likely never be able to work their way up. They get mad at random groups of minorities as they are basically utilized as a common enemy to unite against and to blame for “takin our jobs” and other bullshit.

Paranormal,fgtvh4j,t1_fgta4bq,1581109826.0,"Hm. Hard to say. It’s definitely not from the Clonazepam though. Usually hallucinations only occur with SSRIs like Prozac in rare instances like with overdose- I just checked my pharmaceutical reference book. Hallucinations are usually from high amounts of dopamine and it overstimulates your brain so the over activity can make your brain “hear” or “see” or “feel” something that isn’t there. Prozac deals more with increasing serotonin so it’s a different chemical entirely. There are instances where meds can cause a random side effect in some people just because, so like there’s a chance it could be the Prozac. I only worry it might be just because you haven’t been on the Prozac very long and it sounds like this stuff started happening around the time you started the Prozac. I would say if you start feeling manic 100% it’s your Prozac and you need to let your doc know— but I might give it another week or two and see how you’re feeling. It takes our bodies some time to adjust psych meds. 

I think if I was you, I would try to do the paranormal fix first, see how things go the next week, and if it doesn’t change anything, go to the doctor and tell them your symptoms."
Paranormal,fgt24g0,t1_fgsx10x,1581097450.0,"If it’s something paranormal that’s bothering OP, where do you suggest they post it then? It’s super gate-keepy to comment that and really mean. Don’t sort by new if you’re just gonna bully others."
Paranormal,fgt0k0w,t3_f0a70e,1581096525.0,"Hello, I’m a nurse but I also believe in the paranormal. Here are some things to help you know if it’s related to your medication/your mental health vs. paranormal. 

1. How long have you been on your medication? If you’re hearing, feeling, and seeing these things but you’ve been on those medications for a least 3 to 4 months or longer and are only just now experiencing these issues, it’s most likely not the medication. Definitely not if you’ve been on it for at least a year. 

2. Regarding mental health, I had those same experiences when my depression was untreated. Depression and anxiety can become so severe that people end up hallucinating sounds, images, even touch. It was the most terrifying thing. When I finally got on my Paxil, all of that went away, colors actually became brighter (colors can also dull with severe depression) and it all around helped a ton! If you’re still feeling symptoms of your depression or like your meds haven’t helped at all, you should get on a different antidepressant all together. If your antidepressant helped at first a lot and then months later you’re feeling crappy again, you need your dosage upped for your Prozac. If you feel like the medication has helped with your depression, then it might be something other than depression. Are you a male or female? And how old are you? Not to scare you, but schizophrenia can develop at certain ages depending on your gender. You would have other symptoms though besides the hallucinating. 

List of Schizophrenia Symptoms: People may experience:
Behavioral: social isolation, disorganized behavior, aggression, agitation, compulsive behavior, excitability, hostility, repetitive movements, self-harm, or lack of restraint
Cognitive: thought disorder, delusion, amnesia, belief that an ordinary event has special and personal meaning, belief that thoughts aren't one's own, disorientation, memory loss, mental confusion, slowness in activity, or false belief of superiority
Mood: anger, anxiety, apathy, feeling detached from self, general discontent, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, elevated mood, or inappropriate emotional response
Psychological: hallucination, paranoia, hearing voices, depression, fear, persecutory delusion, or religious delusion
Speech: circumstantial speech, incoherent speech, rapid and frenzied speaking, or speech disorder
Also common: fatigue, impaired motor coordination, or lack of emotional response

If you are living with other people OP, they would be able to tell if you were acting different. If you have a close friend or family member that is telling you they are worried and you’re acting strange— that’s a sign you need to go to your doctor and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist. Many people with Schizophrenia can live normal lives when they are properly medicated. So please don’t let that scare you! I work with people who have schizophrenia all the time and really they just want to know what’s reality and what’s not when they aren’t medicated. They’re scared, and just need understanding and help. They aren’t bad people. It’s a scary disorder to have. 

3. Do you see, feel, and hear those things during your sleep paralysis only as well? Because then it’s just sleep paralysis and I would talk to your doc mentioning you’re having issues with sleep paralysis. They might be able to help you with it. If you’re having those issues and you’re not having sleep paralysis and it’s not your meds or mental health— THEN I would go on to investigate paranormal causes.

4.  If paranormal, are others in your house experiencing issues? If yes, it’s definitely paranormal. I would recommend burning white sage in the 4 corners of each floor. So like example- first floor most left corner might be the living room, then move on to most right corner of house or apartment in another room etc. If you have multiple stories do the four corners on each level. Also, take salt and place in the four corners of your home on each level as well. Burn 3 incense sticks at the same time. It helps ward of negative energy. Finally, I’d place a prayer card under your pillow when you go to sleep— I’ve found this can help a lot if you have nightmares of demons. If you feel like that is not enough, I would go to whatever religious church or place of worship you most strongly affiliate with (I’m agnostic but I grew up Catholic, so for example I would go to a Catholic Church). Ask a Priest or Rabbi or someone of spiritual significance to bless you and ask for a blessing of protection. 

I hope this helps you figure out the cause of what’s going on. No matter the cause, it’s really scary to experience those things. Please be safe. I’ll send smoke and prayers your way (Our Native American tradition of burning white sage or tobacco done to send strength and protection to another person).

Edit: go get your Ouija board as well and ASAP— if you never said “goodbye”. If you did, then I’d just get rid of the Ouija board. If you haven’t, bring it out with a friend and tell the spirit they need to leave your home, then move over to “good-bye”— this closes the Ouija board connection. Then I would toss it in a dumpster. Those things never bring anything good."
Paranormal,fgswg1s,t3_f0anza,1581094074.0,"I use to have a lot of weird dreams related to ghosts, but it usually wasn’t people that I knew. It definitely feels different when you have a dream and it’s a spirit— everything is super clear and vivid even after waking up you remember a lot of it. It sounds like the type of dreams you’re having are visitation dreams. It’s when a loved one— person or animal— has passed and they visit you to pretty much let you know they are okay and to say good-bye. The one with your grandma probably had more to do with her letting you know “hey I’m alright. I’m not suffering anymore. Look I can dance and move and do all these things I wasn’t able to do!” If you ever have a dream with her again, I would just tell her that you love her and you’re happy she’s not hurting anymore, but that you and your family miss her. Tell her it’s okay though and you’ll see her again someday. She can move on that way, knowing her family is alright."

This also doesn’t touch on issues with under employment. Just because someone can get a job, doesn’t mean they can afford housing and basic utilities in the area. 

In regards to the VA for mental health, it is super hard to get assistance for stuff like addiction disorder and other mental health issues. I work as a nurse and me plus a social work team have tried so many different times to help homeless mentally ill veterans get accepted into some type of VA program. It’s super hard and a lot of times the veterans aren’t able to fill out the forms and paperwork due to their mental illnesses— and we try to help but we simply do not have all of their information to be able to fill it out for them.

Plus the government hasn’t put any regulatory legislation on healthcare costs (with the exception of Medicare/Medicaid)—- the price raising is typically the cycle of insurance companies saying they want to give their customers a discount— hospitals jack up prices so no actual money is lost, insurance companies get weird “in network discounts” which are still jacked up, and then hospitals are allowed to charge extra to out of network or if you don’t have insurance. Unfortunately the right just wants unregulated capitalism even when it comes to nominal goods and services. I’ve done so many stupid research papers on the broken American healthcare system, and in order to cut prices drastically and make things affordable, price limits need to be set on healthcare services and insurance companies need to disappear— they just make the prices higher."
