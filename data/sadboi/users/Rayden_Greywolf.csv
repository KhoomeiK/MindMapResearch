Existential_crisis,ffxn4hi,t3_evjb9x,1580328505.0,"In a way, as paradoxical as it is, the personal journey  itself towards finding meaning in a seemingly uncaring and meaningless world ends up giving my existence more meaning. Even though it feels sometimes like nothing matters and I wish that there was Nothing instead of this painful Everything, I at least know that I care about those kinds of things. Even if (it feels like) nobody else cares about that kind of existential pain, I can't deny or doubt that I care. And I think knowing that somebody, even if its just yourself, cares....that can make a huge difference."
Empaths,ffxmdrd,t3_evox9z,1580328069.0,"Oh wow....this really hits home. I've been working on this kind of healing myself for a long time, but seeing it written down like this is really validating and encouraging.

I like to think of that loving inner voice as either my Higher Self, the soul-mind self that is currently incarnated within me, or a combination of the two. When I first started on my spiritual journey and was very lost amid a continual existential crisis, I had sort of externalized that need for love in the form of a desperate need for my soul, spirit guides, or any kind of spiritual being really to manifest somehow in a tangible way that I couldn't later doubt. In learning lessons like this kind of healing, I've slowly begun to realize that the love I wanted and needed was all around and within me, I just didn't trust in the power and truth of that voice. Since then I've had several important spiritual experiences, and each of those has been trying to prove to me one overwhelmingly meaningful message: I can believe in the love I feel and desire, and everything is going to be okay."

Soulnexus,f4sdeb3,t3_dlj35v,1571776674.0,"I have mixed feelings about this.

On one hand, yes, there is importance and beauty in experiencing the full spectrum of feeling. Love as well as pain. On the other hand, I think its important to recognize and honor the growing unease insociety as valid and an indication that there is room to improve. I'm one of those people who joke in spiritual groups about wanting to go home (""whose bright idea was this anyway, incarnating here....its madness!"", when, it was mostly my own idea, spiritually speaking). I think its just as important to hold space for and accept these feelings as it is to point out the good parts of incarnating. Its very frustrating for a depressed or suicidal person to be told of the beauty of life. When spirituality is thrown in, its even more alienating. To a person who is in that darkness, feeling it deeply, the light can seem like some cruel joke.

Perhaps human life is a gift, but its also hard work. Many of us are here on a mission to heal wounds that have run deep in this world, repeating with each generation. Such a mission can often cause despair and hopelessness among the healers. This pain can lead to deeper healing, empathy, and growth, yes, but I have to believe that experiencing the pain is not the goal here. Its a sign that tells us that things could be better, and helps point the way for us to make things better.

So generally, these kinds of posts never sat well with me. There is beauty in healing this world, yes. But we also have to be aware of what is causing the wounds that need healed and work to improve those conditions."

To be aware of the suffering and injustice in the world, though, is the first step in coming to understand it and how to help heal it.

I don't want to fill up this thread or subreddit with my personal spiritual beliefs (message me if you are actually interested), but basically just some realizations that a lot of the suffering comes from, or at least gets made much worse by, various forms of denial. Denial in thinking that life is this wonderful and happy experience for everyone, but also denial in the form of feeling completely helpless and apathetic to the suffering. For instance, it was very liberating for me to accept my feelings that life in general is actually pretty difficult and painful, when most people, therapists and doctors included, would try to suggest ""it's just the depression talking and warping my view"". That was the first step. The second step for me deals more with my personal beliefs, but comes down to accepting that, while its understandable to want to avoid the pain, running from it indefinitely is probably not the best idea, and working to improve the situation is possible and a worthy goal. Let it eat you from the inside, or tell it go fuck itself and be a good person despite it all, essentially."
