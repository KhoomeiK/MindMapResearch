Moby fucking Dick is numero uno, the greatest English language novel of all time, clearly already mentioned (i disagree wholeheartedly about the narrative narrowness, but whatever... The bottom line is you cannot even live in the same zip code as well read until youse have read this stellar fucker) but i wanted to reiterate.  I didn't believe how good it was... It does have an eclectic and flowery style of prose.  Gatsby, in contrast, contains not a wasted word, but Dick prolly could've been like a hundred pages shorter... Would have sucked a donkey dick in that case, but it could've happened. 

Tropic of Capricorn-it's #1 better than cancer and it's about America and I'm telling you the fetid miasma, ennui and general sense of malaise so accurately described by Miller therein could just as easily be happening today... I mean either Donald Trump is the literal shitdicker antichrist or he's Jesus Christ incarnate and those fascist democrats just won't let him make America great again... I mean it's gotta be either/or right?

Included was a book of 2001... To wit, i took a poetry compisition course a few years ago and our term project was to bind all our poems and this journal we kept all semester and turn it in.   I used an old copy of 2001 to make the cover of mine and it's seriously (the binding... The poetry is atrocious) one of the things in my life I'm proudest of.  Anyway, by old i mean the grey vhs one that had the flip open front cover, and was slightly oversized.  Just funny you should offer, i feel guilty taking you up on it, like i should just go buy a copy...  

Those books i sent the other day cost $21.  

In any case, i was reasonably sure they were written at the same time or something... I actually had it in my head that Clark had a sort of bare-bones outline and that he and Kubrick went back and hashed it out but for many years even though Kubrick was my favorite director I had a distinct distaste for 2001 I finally got the Stanley Kubrick masterpieces collection on Blu-ray a few summers ago and I re-watched it and I was shocked, shocked I tell you at how wrong I have been and how good it was for years anytime I had watched it I fast forwarded through the beginning... The monkey part, I thought it was too long and interminable, with the screeching... It truly reminded me of watching early Beatles concerts wherein all one can hear is a ""load of thirteen year old girls wetting themselves.  Can you imagine...

 philistine!!!  I was an absolute philistine, the truly tragic thing is that I was a fan of Kubrick,and I consider that I have reasonable taste when it comes to films and yet it took me seeing that website called they shoot pictures don't they?

 I'm f****** kidding I hate people who do that but I can't do fiction and nonfiction together so I'll tell you what people you're welcome to not read my list I'll give you that honor if by naming six books I've broken the rules.

1.  Tropic of Capricorn...  the first two pages or so thats just like Jesus Christ speaking me me or something it's magical... anytime I'm given an opportunity in a class to just read something at random I read those same two pages every time.  The whole fucking book 2 the way he satirizes everybody and destroys all this mendacity and Rip's asunder all the b******* of society it's... I mean... I almost want to cry talking about it and I can't stand it when because Miller refers to certain woman's body parts by certain offensive words (which a're pretty f****** commonplace in other countries where cunt means best mate or man actually, i mean brits/scots have to be referring to men like 90% of the time they say that word, and besides if you couldn't tell, ilove swearing, people say, ""only people who never learned to express themselves any better speak in vulgarities... What a city block sized load of horse shit that is... People who can swear with panache, verve, and dynamism are the real masters of language... Think lee ermey in full metal... Motherfucking one of the all time great film characters...i believe he ad libed most/some/all/part/none/a Lil of that pictures dialogue) for one thing but by dint of calling a part of the anatomy an offensive term that makes you sexist I mean that's... that's crazy man let's not swing too far the other way.  In any case I would virtually guarantee I read more Henry Miller than anybody here and that's not a bragging just most people haven't read the Obscure ass books and I simply don't see sexism or anti-Semitism at all but anyway that's what they're all saying over at Amazon so that's why I threw that in there.

2.  1984 So fucking important... Do i hear this correctly do right wingers try to claim Orwell... Surely not, i was unaware of this and i thought I'd heard everything (wink in case that doesn't read).  Thats fucking preposterous... Like them totally missing the mark on born in the USA or inviting Steven colbert to that conservative dinner party back in the day when he first came out (side note, way funnier as fake righty...he's fucking terrible as a ""genuine"" [i guess Anyway] mainstream American liberal...)  oh and the ending... There are a Lotta ways that ending could've gone... SPOILER ALERT. Red fucking alert right now-he could've had them escape to the country or join the underground or some shit, i mean a true ""happy"" ending could only have been the biggest deus ex machina in history... But there are middle of the road semi happy endings he could have made work... But oh no, oh hell no he rolled hard with it... Damn that ending... 

3. Tender is the night... What it cost to write... I love that Mike Tyson quote, ""show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy""
Telling you what, for starters that little tete a tete betwixt Hemingway and fitzgerald about the rich is almost always told wrong, fitzgerald was trying, i believe, to speak about the darker, much fucking darker, cancerous, gangrenous truth that, by the present is no longer rotting the very core of our society... That fucking ship sailed about forty fucking years ago now.  When Scott said it there was still, at least theatrically, time...   You like Hemingway, he's fucking great sun also is some old genius shit, but it sickens me the people that make Fitzgerald into the ""authority on success"" and ernest the ""authority on failure""  Hemingway was a hunting, animal skinning, bull fight watching, hair on the chest, man's man with a slew of mistresses and all those epochal signs of (hyper)masculinity and fitzgerald was apparently so fucking cute in drag for fi fee fee (some shit) for the Princeton triangle club that it caused a goddamn sensation on campus. He was effiminate, mostly faithful to his wife while she took lovers quite openly (maybe not openly took lovers, at least openly flirted very heavily and then did take some lovers), couldn't hold his liquor, was terrible at sports and man's man activities... But you read their work and fitzgeralds shit is all sunshine and roses on the surface... But only in the surface, that shit ""hides"" (or more accurately attempts to cover up) a fetid and festering miasma...  Gatsby is dark as fuck and tender sure gets there, the early airy ephemera is only that much more completely destroyed when the book shifts gears... 

Hemingway the dark, brooding manly man... Fucking false dichotomy makes me sick... 

Huh?

Guess you've had enough I'll spare all the good people of the world anymore of my trite and overwrought inanity.   Good fucking night"
booksuggestions,fkfy70h,t1_fkfq0y5,1584145352.0,"In all honestly i think i wrote that shittier than i meant too, I'm all revved up on space dust.  Anyway, my main thing is, after i heard so many people say either moby dick or heart were the best English language novel ever, i read moby and it changed life.  I'd be at my landscaping job listening to it and a passage would floor me to such a degree I'd have to sit down and run the passage back, sometimes I'd sit there and run the same few minutes back like five times, under penalty of death if I was, like Clevon Little, caught napping on the job.   Then i got heart narrated by my favorite narrator of all time (seriously if you have even a passing interest in why the world is the way it is you owe it to yourself to watch CNN's 24 part almost century spanning documentary series cold war, i believe they're all on YouTube.  Soldiers of god, good guys/bad guys, backyard, Vietnam, spies, and star wars.. I can't do it i was gonna try and name a few good ones... There is literally like 0 throwaway episodes in 24 hr. Long shows and it was done in like '98 when a ton of these George Keenan, robert mcnamara, john stockwell, general giap, and dobryon were still alive) and i thought it was... It was one of the most dispiriting, no the most, the most dispiriting literary experience of my entire life.  I love apocalypse now so much that i am wont to say it's better than the Godfather... It isn't, but man do i want to say it is...  I think the original dude said it was a great lesson on imperialism...  I get thatsthe message, I'm not dense enough to miss that, but I've got a two hour doc on theBelgian Congo that is 213%more enlightening on the subject.  Furthermore, it was nothing like the valuable, poignant lesson from the jungle.  And i didn't think it was all it was cracked up to be from a literary standpoint either.  I just... It was like watching crimes and misdemeanors by woody Allen, it's Allen in his prime and it's got too many of my favorite actors and too many smart, classy people said its good, it Has To Be Good... And i fucking hated it, save exact shit as heart of darkness.  

So any way sorry, my vitriol was for this book, not you... You just got caught in the crossfire and for that, i am genuinely sorry.  Please accept my apology madam or sir. 

Additionally, the apocalypse comparison was 100% tongue in cheek.  You are of course right about book/film comparisons... 

You know which one bums me out the worst 1984.  Just saw that the other day and that dude from alien that plays Winston Smith is a fucking terrific actor and they had the shabby looking city, the ill fitting clothes, the vibrant prole community... Hell they even got all the shitty dust tobacco sliding out of the smoke when Winston starts to light one abscentmindedly (is that not a word or i just spell it wrong?  Oh well don't careenough to look it up) goes to light up like with a qual cig (wherein the tobacco stays in no matter what... Lest you-and i hope fur yourn health it ain't so-one of 'em 'ere disgusting non smokers who don't know that)

Anywho
Shits and giggles quick list of some fairly accurate conversions 
1. Nah, I'm trying to do this too quick, I'll end up saying some dumb shit (been stuck on that fucking road all day)... Like right off the rip i was thinking of fear and loathing which is maybe controversial/an insult to hunter Thompson purists (which i mean i named the best friend i ever had after the motherfucker...but still).  I thought they nailed the scene in the desert at the beginning I thought they nailed the scene where they pick up the great red shark I thought they nailed the same where he's tripping balls trying to check into the hotel I thought they nailed a lot of f****** scenes and the overall Vibe I thought was great.  Anyway then I was going to say Fight Club I have one or two actually big ass problems without at movie was done that innocence ruin the whole picture but only if you let them I think Norton and Pitt did really good jobs Helena carter... it's the role of a f****** lifetime for her I mean it's perfectly cast... meatloaf as Bob come on and stylistically it's right on point but there's a big ass hole in the film story that's not there in the book and they f*** the ending up but I don't want to say anymore cuz I don't want to spoil the s*** out of it for people haven't seen or read it.  I guess I came up with two more current pictures for the simple fact that it seems like old translations used to be more faithful it seems like nowadays they fuck up every single book they try to take to the screen"

5.  I just always liked the title and it's proximity to books i knew to be excellent was promising. 

Oh, so i wanted to ask, i hate Steven (I'll spell it however i want) king... The best thing he ever did was give Stanley Kubrick a good sight gag when he had (it's red versus yellow, but i don't remember which has which, i feel like the movie had yellow) Steven's choice of color for Jack torrance's bug smashed by a semi in the snow when ole scatman was a driving up there to save 'at ole Lil boy. Priceless just like Stanley, yeah i took your story and made it better, what of it, to grind his heel into the corpse publicly...  Incidentally,  i just finished the luck of Barry Lyndon on audible and the dude who reads it givesa masterful performance... He does all the accents, a pretty fair chick voice, and even an eerily convincing scared little boy... And still the film is better... (i know an asshole who said that only ever happened one time in the history of film adaptations!  What a fucking rube!  Shit i just conclusively proved that Kubrick is 2/2 on doing it in this post alone.  Paths, 2001 and clean break/the killing are Prolly better films-hadn't read those-full metal is better than the excerpts of the short timers I've read, Prolly only twenty pages though, full disclosure, and clockwork is absolutely spot on for 20 chapters... He just, for whatever reason, despite having lived in England for virtually the books entire'published history, decided to use the American version... Maybe he liked the lack of morality, but I'm really straying [Ha!] into douchebag territory trying to discern the motivations of a decades dead dynamo)

Merde!"
booksuggestions,fkfnby7,t1_fkfcely,1584138248.0,"A slug to read?  Kenneth Branagh (certainly in the convo for most pleasing voice on earth and I'm the yank who dislikes plummy British accents) gets through it in 3:49 and some other homie does it in 4:06.  As such, it's a short book... Anyway, I only commented because i wanted to say this is the only instance in the history of mankind in which the movie is better..."
