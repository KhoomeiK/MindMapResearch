Not that I blame him, as I did the same thing. Kind of expected to do so when you're married. 

He basically told me to either get my wife straight or go fuck myself... well, I'm not gonna pretend to be able to control what my spouse says or does. She's her own person after all. It just sucks because at this point, I've written off having friends and am going to try the ""lone wolf"" approach. I have family, coworkers, and friendly acquaintances. 

My wife offered my friendship to someone else... catch is, it's the boyfriend of the woman who started all this bullshit in the first place. I don't like you in the slightest, why the hell would I want to befriend your boyfriend? Just because we share interests does not mean I want to freely associate with you - and I explained this to my wife but somehow I'm being irrational. I dunno.
