I really was a little skeptical and thought it was just that the BP2 or GAD was causing similar symptoms, but as the bipolar treatment has drastically reduced those symptoms, I've getting more aware of the ADHD symptoms...it's not bad, and probably doesn't need medication, but it is noticeable. I did discuss meds with my prescriber, but their thought is to focus on getting the bipolar under control before discussing meds for it. Right now, I just mitigate it by being careful to make lists, put up post-its for things I need to do, be conscientious about putting things a calendar, etc."

Music is a wonderful thing, and musical taste is super subjective (although, modern pop music doesn't really qualify as music, so we don't care about that for purposes of our discussion. ;) )

I've struggled off and on with weight over the years (when you're depressed, who cares about exercise or eating right?). I honestly think it has a lot to do with how we (subconsciously) perceive ourselves. If you're overweight, then that is what you're used to as a person, the ""normal"" in other words, and changing that means changing your understanding of yourself. In other words, it's uncomfortable to change because we're also changing what we've had as a perception of ourselves. What has helped me to start losing weight is to invert that idea, that I perceive the overweight version of myself is not who I really am, and that losing weight gets me back to the ""normal"" version of myself.

As for the rest, it's not unheard of for people without mental illness to make changes to their weight, appearance, income, etc, and decide that since they're not the person they once were, they can also do away with their SO and date around (this actually happened to my neighbors who split up a while back when both of them got in shape). Assuming you're seeing a therapist, it would be good to discuss all this with them and see if there are some steps you can do to mitigate your fears, as getting in better shape and health helps immensely with both the mental aspects, but also the physical stresses that bipolar places on our bodies."

bipolar2,fqlcze7,t3_gjj4o6,1589454377.0,"Irregular sleep is a real problem for people with bp2. Apparently, one symptom is having your circadian rhythms thrown out of whack, but it probably makes sense if your brain is misfiring. I can get to sleep, but I often wake up at three-ish in the morning completely alert and ready to go. Of course, that's my brain, not my body, wanting to do that. I've found that time release melatonin has been great, as as long as I can get back to sleep, I'm mostly okay, and it makes it relatively easy to do so for the most part (today was an exception, can already tell I'm going to hit the couch later for a power nap).

As for your thoughts, I lived for a long time without treatment of any kind, so you have my understanding and support. While it wasn't a cure by any means, Zen meditation isn't bad for working through what you're thinking and tending to compartmentalize intrusive thoughts. They don't go away, but instead sort of exist in a separate space after a while where you can process them without being flooded by them.

The other thing is that it sounds like this isn't all bipolar by any means. You have some stuff going on in life that's not just the illness, and not easily resolvable. It might not hurt to see if there are some meetups or support groups in your area (NAMI should have listings if there are), to at least provide some support in the interim."

bipolar2,fqijuc5,t3_githkf,1589396961.0,"Umm. It is a difficult road if you're not on medication, plus there are medical reasons to be on medication. Bipolar can cause progressive brain damage (jury's still out on the magnitude, effect and nature of that, last I heard), plus the stress levels we experience from it can cause cardiovascular problems over time. There is also the social, legal, financial, personal, professional, academic fallout from it. I've lost count on the number of people I've gone off of when hypomanic, the stupid things I've done, losing my temper, breaking stuff, etc. Also the failures and hopelessness and inability to get things done when I was depressed.

I have had bipolar symptoms most of my life, was diagnosed with manic depression at 20-21, but didn't accept the diagnosis and did not seek treatment/get properly diagnosed for BP2 for a couple of decades. I self-medicated with alcohol for a long time, but it was putting a band aid on things. I was put on paroxitene, lamotrigine, and clonidine to handle BP2 with severe depression and anxiety.

For the first time in my life, I have finally begin to feel normal most of the time. I rapid cycle still, but it's much less intense and I can generally regulate my behavior and reactions before things get out of hand. No suicidal ideation, no anhedonia or depersonalization, or any other negatives related to BP2 and severe depression. I used to have a few days out of the year when I felt ""okay,"" they were like gold. Now, most days I feel ""okay.""

Are meds worth it? I guess it depends on your situation, but mine was a mess for a long time and nothing addressed it outside of getting on medication. I'm not super thrilled about having to take meds, and I'm a little paranoid about lamotrigine rash (I have poison ivy on my arm right now and am like, umm...hopefully it's just poison ivy...), and don't like how the clonidine makes me drowsy three hours after I take it (unless I'm mildly hypo like I am right now - lots of excess talking, good focus, jokes no one laughs at, trouble staying asleep at night, etc).

At the end of the day, you have to decide what you want from your life and how you want to feel. I've done no medication for a long time, and I've been on meds for the better part of a year now and can honestly say it was the best decision I've ever made."

There is a tendency to throw SSRIs at situational depression without addressing what led to it in the first place, or for people to say that someone's problems are just because they're whiny and don't need more care.

I'd march right on in there and be like ""Yes, yup, things are fine, except for a little bit here and there."" Of course, that was all bullshit. I finally got called out by my therapist when I was saying that my spouse was threatening to leave (again) because of my behavior. They asked, ""How do you feel about that?"" I said ""Well, kinda bad..."" To that, they responded with ""Seriously? Your personal life is going down the toilet and that's all you feel about it?"" After that visit, a visit to get some medication and breaking down in tears in it because I couldn't deal with things any longer, they started to get better.

Look, the thing is, this is your life. It doesn't matter at all what they think of you on a personal basis. What matters is if they're giving you good care, if it's thorough, and it's improving your life. Be honest about how you feel, say it's nothing personal, but that you need to have some reassurance. If they get defensive about it, maybe look at getting another doctor. It's not uncommon for people to get wary of doctors after a while...I basically raised a middle finger to the establishment when I was originally diagnosed with manic depression (big mistake) and lived many years in misery because of it, even though it was quite clear I had some major problems.

Really, the root of this is repressing what you're feeling. Go in and be honest about your feelings. There's a line from an Austin Collins song - ""It's easier to offend you than to hold my breath for days."" Honestly, on the part of your doctor - if they care at all, and many do - then they will also probably be a little relieved if you're starting to come clean on how really feel than holding things back.

bipolar2,fqbzt4h,t3_ghsx36,1589247201.0,"Yeah. That. I have showed bipolar symptoms most of my life, but no one ever picked up on it. Finally, around 20-21, I got diagnosed with manic depression, handed a bottle of lithium and told to go on my merry way. I thought they were full of crap, walked away from the establishment, didn't look back for a couple of decades until I was exhausted from trying to keep it all together. Meds, therapy, and self-care have been the order of the day since then. Each has a part to play and all are equally important.

Guilt is a very common thing, natural, and understandable, but it's also not exactly warranted much of the time. We have a little malfunction in our brains that pushes us towards doing some truly stupid shit at times. There is so much that I wish I could take back, how many times I've hurt others and myself, things I wish I could do over again, but I just have today to work with.

What you do now is take a deep breath, realize that you had this illness a long time before it was ever diagnosed, and that things are going to get better from here. It's going to be okay, it's not the end of the world. A lot of the time, people also feel uncomfortable with a diagnosis because they worry about stigma, what people will think, etc. Depending on the type of person you are, leaning into isn't the worst thing to do. Be okay with having bipolar, don't worry about what others think, or what you think they think, or what you think you should think. Sometimes my dark sense of humor grates people's nerves, but it's okay. I've earned the right to make jokes about death and dying. It comes with the territory because the only reason I'm still alive is that I couldn't figure out how to word a suicide note to my satisfaction. It comes because of the broken lives and suicide that runs in my family because people were ashamed to be ill or help those who were.

I also lean into it by volunteering and being a mental health advocate. I never would have thought I'd wind up doing that sort of thing, but looking back and seeing how awful life was at times has sort of made me really want to help others avoid having the pain I had. Take this, and turn it into something positive when you're ready to do so. I think it is not people who have a mental illness and stay positive and function the best they can with it who are stigmatized, but the people who wear it like a badge of victimhood, who want pity and sympathy, without trying help themselves, too.

Last, this is a great place to hang out and get to know some people. Odds are pretty good that at least a handful of people here have had the same experiences as you and can relate. Bipolar is such a variable disorder in how it is expressed, too. Don't worry if your experiences aren't the same as others, either. This is a great community and you are more than welcome here!"
bipolar2,fqbxfg0,t3_ghw163,1589245830.0,"I lived unmedicated for a long, long time (long story, thought I just had depression). I would do well at work, but would walk in the door at home either just dead or so irritable that I would lash out at everyone. Such was the price of keeping it together (most of the time) for eight hours, just trying to make it to the end of the day.

You are hardly lazy. It's like saying someone with one leg is lazy because they can't do cartwheels.

Coping without meds...be easy on yourself. It's so easy to get into a spiral of not being able to meet your expectations, which further pushes you into psychological depression, further affecting your energy and mood. Have lower expectations from yourself, at least until you get back on meds again. It's okay to put all your effort into work and just be super lazy at home. Also, we're all conditioned to work our asses off all the time. If we're not out making a buck, we're supposed to be training for a marathon or rediscovering how to make Incan pottery while doing a yoga pose at the same time, or some shit along those lines. Some days, yeah, I'll do some gardening, fix something, go running. But, even with meds, I don't feel like doing all that, and it's okay. Life's meant to be lived, not performed, and if we're living the best we can at any given time, that's okay, too.

I think hypomania is harder to deal with, at least it always has been for me. You would not believe the number of friendships it's cost me, holes I've punched in walls, yadda yadda. I remember being so amped up that I would work all day and come home and work all night. People thought it was great, but didn't take into account WHY I was doing that. Lots of great ideas, no real restraint on what I was doing or why I was doing it. Absolutely worthless bromides like ""Count to ten before speaking"" or ""take a time out"" did nothing to restrain me. Looking back, I think maybe one way of dealing with it would have been to have an ""in case of hypomania break glass (though not with your first)"" kit. Like a whole list of stupidly ambitious projects drawn up or something similar to sink my energy into. Instead, it turned to anger a lot of the time.

bipolar2,fqal5uz,t1_fqage56,1589220929.0,"Very true. I think both the lows and highs also tend to cause a lot of emotional stress which is bad for anyone, honestly.

bipolar2,fq9o744,t3_ghdnl6,1589203426.0,"I had an extremely bad experience with SSRIs alone. Typically, since depression is what is initially diagnosed in place of bipolar 2, they are prescribed first and can cause a lot of issues. With me, it threw my hypomania into overdrive...won't go into details, but it was ugly. In fact, I think that anyone who gets prescribed SSRIs should be screened for bipolar 2 symptoms as well, just to avoid that. I was honestly worried about getting on a mood stabilizer (lamotrigine) in combination with an SSRI...however, it's allowed me for the first time in my life to feel ""normal."" (it's been adjustment to NOT feel either depressed or hypomanic all the time!)

The other thing...not to be alarmist, but bipolar is through to cause progressive brain damage when the brain is cycling back and forth. Medication reduces this damage or can potentially halt it all together from what research seems to indicate. Additionally, it is common for people with bipolar to have cardiovascular issues, particularly hypertension. Therefore, medication is not just to address behavior and mood, but also to reduce other comorbid physical issues.

As for support...reading up on it is helpful, but it's difficult to fully understand the experience unless you have the problem. Additionally, most people experience it in different ways and intensities. I rapid cycle, which means I am hypomanic for a couple of weeks, and depressive for a few weeks (this was prior to getting on medication, now I'm either stable or slightly hypo most of the time). Your wife is her own best expert on how she feels, so listening, being empathetic, and not trying to correct or put your own bias on what she is saying is most helpful.

At first, my spouse was very resistant to my diagnosis, my medications, and trying to communicate anything about it, while she has her own mental health struggles with anxiety. This caused some resentment for me, particularly as I was beginning to feel better and seeing improvements in how I was interacting with others, etc. While it sounds like you are trying to be more open, it's worth watching out for the implicit biases that our culture has against people with mental illness and not trying to reinterpret what communication in that light.

Also, don't interpret your love for her and marriage through any sort of lens or inject bipolar into it, outside of understanding at times that she is not always capable of being one hundred percent present in the moment. Mental illness is a piece of a person, but it's not the whole person by any means. She's still the same person you fell in love with, and you're the same person she loves back. It may be a rocky road at times, but it's still there.

Last, if she is doing therapy, then it might be helpful to see if you can go to therapy with her now and then, mostly to see if you are being supportive and to learn about strategies or ways you can help support her.

It sounds like you are doing everything that the spouse of a person with bipolar should be, and I think everyone here applauds your efforts to do so. Keep it up!"

So, really, two things...are you embarrassed for yourself how you acted, and/or do you feel guilt for how you've treated others in the past? **Most of us feel the same way at times about this, and it's something that you can work through with a therapist.** The other thing to remember is that even people without bipolar still have times when they make the wrong decision, feel bad about the things they've done at times (unless they're truly psychopathic), and have things they wish they've done or said they could take back. Do we have more of those? Sure, but it's not an experience exclusive to us.

In fact, this is something I've been working through with my therapist now and then, as it comes up. Part of it is forgiving yourself, but part of it is also letting go of how you've acted, too. You can't change it and the things you intensely remember may not be remembered as intensely by others, necessarily. Learn from it, learn what triggers it, and how to potentially defuse it before it happens. I have so many times that I've gone off on people - friends, family, co-workers, random people working in the drive through, etc...I wish I could take it all back, but I can't. Best I can do is be kinder and more empathetic going forward.

Also, getting involved in an organization or group where you can ""pay it forward"" is a good idea. You don't have to commit a lot of time, but you can begin to balance it out by helping others.

Some other good news for you - I've been on lamotrigine for a while and it has worked wonders with me. I rapid cycle, but it has managed to greatly reduce the amount of cycling, plus greatly reducing the intensity. Be careful to follow exactly your doctor's directions on increasing the dosage, too. But, it's allowed me to start feeling ""normal"" for the first time in my life (I started showing bipolar symptoms at 4 or 5, even though I wasn't diagnosed until much later).

It'll be okay in the long run, and you've on the road to getting much, much better!"
bipolar2,fq9kjym,t3_gh4trd,1589200876.0,"Eh, it sounds pretty bipolar 2-ish, especially since you've been diagnosed. I think most of us can relate to your experiences, and you can relate to ours - we're all one big bipolar 2 family, along with our bipolar 1 cousins. Or something like that.

My last three days - cycled into deep depression Friday afternoon. Couldn't think, couldn't focus, just wanted to lay in bed and not move. Yesterday was sorta normalish. This morning, I was volatile and snapping at the family, but managed to catch myself and self-isolate until the worst of it passed. Tonight, I'm super chatty, acting like a nut, and vacillating between anger and elation. I rapid cycle and it gets exacerbated each time my lamotrigine gets bumped up. This will all settle down in a couple of weeks and I'll be back to my usual very mild hypomania and now and then getting a little depression going.

Getting on a real treatment plan, with therapy, medication (by a psychiatric professional, not a GP), doing self-care...all of this has made a huge difference in my life. Both Friday and today, I was able to clearly identify when I was cycling and to take appropriate steps to minimize the impact on my family. I cannot overstate the positive effects that meds have had on my bipolar."
bipolar2,fq9kh9j,t1_fq6c52d,1589200820.0,"Yeah, bipolar can come on at different times in life. I showed symptoms at a very young age (4 or 5). While it's typically not diagnosed that young, it is recognized that it can occur in children. I don't really remember ""normal,"" so being on meds is not a return to it, as I don't really have a baseline to compare it to. In a sense, it was like trying to take on a new persona.

In your case, I would think that medication would let you begin reconnecting to what used to seem familiar to you. To be blunt, I was scared of taking medications again after the terrible experience I had with SSRIs in the absence of a mood stabilizer (it was bad), so I was hesitant to try anything medication-related. It's been a very positive experience, though, letting me get a handle on my cycling, reducing intensity and frequency, etc.

The biggest problem I've had so far is sleepiness with my anti-anxiety med about 2-3 hours after taking it, and with rapid cycling being aggravated each time I bump up my lamotrigine, but that tends to stop once the dosage is level for a little while again."
bipolar2,fq5v8ln,t3_ggrksq,1589118315.0,"Big internet hug, and yes, it's okay and it will pass. 100mg is a really low dose...I was on that for a bit, was doing well, but still had some hypomania and whatnot. Now, I'm going up to 200mg and hoping it evens out again. This will pass...it is just hard for you right now, but it will get better again!"
bipolar2,fq4bfox,t3_ggpect,1589075658.0,"Yeah, I wish I had some better advice in this category...I've lost count of the number of times my spouse has said they were going to leave, and that the kids want to go with them. Things have been slowly getting better-ish since I've gotten on meds, but it's also come with more awareness causing more anxiety about where I'm going to be from day to day.

I totally get where you're coming from, though...I wish I had better advice, or some advice, but I don't have anything good here. Just take a moment and remember that you're dealing with an illness that doesn't always let us be the person we want to be, so give yourself some grace and forgiveness here, too."
bipolar2,fq4anx4,t3_ggqb5x,1589075393.0,"I went the other direction. I lived a long time without meds and finally got on them less than a year ago, when I was re-diagnosed with BP2 (long story). I couldn't deal any longer with the cycling and the impact it was having on me as a person and those around me. From my perspective of living without meds...I was always fearful of people seeing me cycle one way or the other (at the time, I didn't recognize this as bipolar, but chalked it up to ""just how I am""). I felt that as time went on, my life was getting ""corroded"" (hence my username), that things I'd built were falling apart because of things that I couldn't address in my mind. I did the meditation, exercise, and diet thing, but it was just a bandaid. I also rapid cycle, so things changed very often and regularly for me, which just made the overall experience. To be blunt, the positive impact that medication has had on my life now is such that I will never stop taking meds unless I can't get them for some reason.

I have thought about writing up a guide to living with bipolar 2 if someone chooses to go without medication...not that I would recommend, but some of the things I learned along the way about it."
bipolar2,fq498p8,t3_ggojcp,1589074941.0,"I have BP2, anxiety, and mild ADHD. I was diagnosed with manic depression back when there was no distinction between BP1 and BP2 after some bad reactions to an SSRI. I did not want to take lithium due to the need for blood tests, etc, plus I did not think I had bipolar but just depression. I walked away from all treatment for a couple of decades, and finally could not see my life completely disintegrate, started therapy for some other reasons, but eventually wound up with a BP2 diagnosis.

Putting it in perspective, while I had gotten my life together enough to go get a BS, I was also drinking heavily to self-medicate, tended to have a lot of ugly outbursts, great ideas that I never really executed on, lots of suicidal ideation, lots of ups and downs, pretty typically rapid cycling bipolar 2. It also contributed to me being fired from one job and burning some bridges with others because of erratic behavior and difficulties getting along with others (in fairness, some of these jobs were toxic environments, but the BP2 didn't help anything for sure). I was also pushing my family away, thinking the issues were with them, not me, and ignoring the stress and anxiety I was putting on all of them.

I got put on paroxetine, lamotrigine, and clonidine (for anxiety and blood pressure). Side effects from the first two have been pretty minimal. Clonidine makes me drowsy around 3 hours after I take it. Coffee followed by a five minute power nap works well (I put my headphones on and look like I'm thinking). I work in tech in a fairly demanding position (babysitting several integrations, doing machine learning, lead developer/architect in all but name, etc - I explicitly do not want a managerial position because I'm not able to manage others...managing myself is a full-time job). If anything...I would say that medication has really helped me with work and personal interactions. While it was possible to concentrate and work with hypomania or depression, it was miserable and I felt desperate for relief much of the time, plus interpersonal stuff got a little dicey at times. 

Being on meds has really made work a lot better and my technical work doesn't seem to have been affected by it much one way or the other. If anything, I'm not distracted by the highs and lows. TBH, I was worried about how being on meds would affect things, but it's been negligible or positive. I rapid cycle and still cycle mildly (from my own experience and others, meds really don't completely eliminated that). My coworkers noticed something of a difference once I got started on meds, probably were used to me being moody and withdrawn or frenetic and normal was a little freaky to them.

I'm really skeptical about the label ""high functioning bipolar."" Sure, I've done reasonably well for myself, but people don't know that it took three tries for me to get through college, don't really know about all the train wrecks I've had along the way, my jacked up finances, bad decisions, etc, etc. I tend to think it's more having enough tenacity to keep going even when it is extremely difficult, some helping hands from people, and getting some breaks here and there. Someone here a while back said that bipolar is ""living life in hard mode."" Sometimes, we manage to find ourselves in the right place (tech is full of people with mental issues and introversion is normal, so you can get away with being withdrawn) where we can find some relief and still function. At my worst, I've hit rock bottom pretty much as hard as anyone else with BP2.

Reach out if you want to talk some more about this. I strongly, strongly recommend getting medication...it is not a perfect solution, but the alternative is definitely much less attractive."
bipolar2,fpxybfs,t3_gfizsv,1588992088.0,"When my father passed away, it triggered hypomania for me. I was cracking jokes at the visitation and felt great the day of his funeral. I'm still ashamed of how I acted then, thinking back on it, and frustrated that I could not grieve in a healthy way because of it. Maybe robbed of that grief might be the best way to put it. (this was back when I did not accept my original manic depressive diagnosis)

What I figured out later on is that grief is a process, not an event. As time went on, I felt dribs and drabs of it come out until I was able to lean into it, understand it, and process it. The other thing is that we can't confuse depression with grief, or hypomania with closure. If your emotions and reactions don't feel appropriate right now, just put them on the back burner, and deal with them as they come up and when you are able to."
bipolar2,fpxxsnm,t3_gflg6d,1588991783.0,"College and bipolar is rough. I do not think anyone with bipolar has an easy go of it. Ironically, work was far easier than college when I finally struggled my way to a degree. Of course, that came with taking fourteen years from start to finish to get a BS. I'd go for a while, then quit because I couldn't deal with it, go back, quit again for a while. My grades were bad at times, decent at other times. I graduated with a 3.2 and was elated with that. Who cares about a 4.0? I'd guess that most people who got a 4.0 weren't dealing with a broken brain.

Truthfully, I'd like to put an arm around you and tell you that it's not as bad as you think. Society judges people based on their utility, not their humanity, so if we aren't running at top speed, on top of things all the time, pushing it to the max, positive as all get out, then we're failures. Obviously, that's bullshit, but it gets ingrained in everyone's head after a while. No one who is getting pulled from a burning car by a random stranger asks that person about the square footage of their house, how many times they've been to the Bahamas, or how soon they're going to make partner at their firm. No, it's all about the compassion, empathy, courage, and love for another human being just because of their humanity. These are not qualities that are exclusive to anyone and are not awarded, but just chosen. You obviously have compassion for other people, and the desire to help them, but have some for yourself, too. 

It is painful not to realize a path to a goal, but there are still ways to that goal. If medical school isn't really an option anymore, consider some alternatives. There are plenty of fields allied to medicine that will still let you be part of health care but without the stressors that becoming a doctor would bring. There is case management, medical IT, administration, etc, etc. Optionally, you can choose a different way of helping people and bettering the world. I have inadvertently become a mental health advocate and am active in volunteering with some mental health initiatives, using my professional skills pro bono because they can't otherwise afford to have certain things done for them. It's not my day job, but it's worthwhile and I'm seeing more of an impact from it as time goes on.

One other thing, even though you might have to grit your teeth to do it (like I do), my therapist always reminds me to say ""I love and accept myself even with all my faults."" It doesn't fix everything, but it's worth keeping in mind."
bipolar2,fpxvysp,t3_gfpz9e,1588990692.0,"Depressive or hypo? I'm starting to think that tactile hallucinations are a sign that a depressive episode is coming on, need to keep a closer eye on that."
bipolar2,fpxvtk1,t3_gfimkc,1588990608.0,"There's a real tension between trying to get some space because things are too difficult to deal with, and trying to meet personal and professional obligations. Particularly when I'm cycling into depression, I have problems with being around people...I cannot face them, particularly ones who know me (like my spouse and kids) because they know something's wrong, that they can do nothing to alleviate it, etc. On the other hand, I know they all get concerned and want to do what they can. I don't want people to feel anxiety because of this, but I also know that disappearing would just increase that feeling.

I am concerned that he is not taking medication, though. Meds don't completely remove bipolar symptoms, but they make things more manageable, take the edge off the highs and lows. Going without medication makes everything drastically worse as best, and is dangerous at worst. I lived for a long time without medication...well, I drank and meditated a lot, but it was just a band-aid. Some people feel like they can have bipolar and be okay without meds, but it reminds me a lot of the dog drinking a cup of coffee in the burning house meme. I've been on both sides of that and can one hundred percent that I will never by choice go without meds again."
bipolar2,fpxuhr6,t3_gfw68s,1588989829.0,"Lot to unpack there. First off, I have issues with dissociative disorder and anhedonia in my depressive phases. I also have anxiety and mild ADHD, so just a whole mix of annoying crap. Bipolar seems to usually come with some extras, not just the bipolar itself, so it's possible to have more than one thing going on.

When I was around 20-21, my parents could not deal with my behavior any longer and insisted I see a therapist. I got on an SSRI and it caused a whole lot of unpleasant behavior. Ultimately, I was diagnosed with manic depression, but didn't believe it and walked away from the establishment for a long time, so it's not unusual to be diagnosed and reject that diagnosis. Mental health issues have a way of clouding how we think about things.

Bipolar 1 is pretty clear when it happens. Bipolar 2 is much more subtle because people with it usually have severe depression as a primary symptom and the hypomania can often be confused with being exuberant at not being depressed, etc. Once you know what to look for, hypomania is pretty distinct. I usually have some initial euphoria, but it can quickly turn into excessive irritability and rage.

If you're not sure, get a second or third opinion. It probably would be a good idea to keep track of your moods...this is subjective, but at least can jog your memory about how you were feeling from time to time and help in conversations about it."
bipolar2,fpxtmsu,t3_gg2q8i,1588989332.0,"Congrats on getting a handle on this, finally!

I've been on lamotrigine and paxil for a while now. I haven't had much in the way of issues with lamotrigine. The biggest thing for me is that it seems like when the dose has been increased, I've gotten random pinprick sensations all over. On the other hand, I'm prone to tactile hallucinations in depression...so it's a little hard to say if it's the lamotrigine that causes it or if it's just a psychoses caused by depression. Throw SJS into the mix and it's a little unnerving, but I'm thinking now that it might be a warning sign of a depressive episode coming on."
bipolar2,fpxsv8k,t3_gg41tw,1588988889.0,"I'm relatively open about it if the subject comes up or it's appropriate. Mostly, I don't feel like reciting my life's story about it over and over to different people. I usually just give people some stuff to look up, briefly explain my symptoms and move on. I'm kind of a ""take me or leave me"" type of person, so it doesn't really matter what people think. That said, I won't go into detail about it...no one needs to know about all the shit that has happened in the past, my fucked up childhood, my family history, all my failures in life and people I've hurt, being alive only because I couldn't get my suicide notes just right, etc. I have a friend who has bipolar 1 and we talk a lot about symptoms, how we're doing, basically a mutual support group, but we never, ever go into personal history and all the ways bipolar has been a train wreck in our lives. It just seems like a boundary that doesn't get crossed because it doesn't need to be.

The people who are good people don't freak out about the bipolar thing, though. If someone is a close-minded asshole, or is too lazy to do a little research on their own, nothing is going to really change that."
bipolar2,fpxrj6x,t1_fpx1r8q,1588988116.0,"Yeah, although ""me"" just horribly sucks as a person in so many ways. :D

So funny what we get used to, and think about ourselves and world, when we're looking at, when other people can look at us and see that how we act isn't normal/health/sane, etc. The messed up thing about it is that it seems ""normal"" to us, so anything that brings that into question just gets rejected and we move on without really getting any resolution."

I take my SSRI in the morning as it can cause insomnia (some people it causes drowsiness, go figure). I can usually fall asleep, even when hypo, but three or so hours later, when it all starts to wear off, I'm up and ready to go. Changing things around has seemed to help, though."

I always say that you had the illness before, but now you can get treatment and start getting it under control. I still have some problems identifying when I'm in one phase or the other, at least until it gets more obvious. Lamotrigine has really flattened out the peaks and valleys for me...not perfect, but it's a whole lot better than it's been.

Also, what caused me to lose confidence in the ""establishment"" was when I was prescribed an SSRI without any mood stabilizer. I was then sent to a pdoc to get lithium, but by then, I was done with the whole business and didn't have anything to do with it for a couple of decades.

I use time release melatonin in addition to everything else. It helps keep your circadian rhythms a little more regular, plus the time release portion will usually help me get back to sleep if I wake up in the middle of the night.

Also, I take lamotrigine at night, not in the morning. Have you tried taking it then?"
bipolar2,fpok5o9,t3_gek1w8,1588785862.0,"You have my understanding (sympathy just sucks as a word). It's complex, but I was essentially undiagnosed for a long time. I've been married for a while, but the untreated bipolar has taken a heavy toll on my marriage and relationship with my spouse and kids. My cycling is much milder now with meds, but meds don't fix years of expectations of the highs and lows and waiting for the next shoe to drop. Even if you don't mean to, you push people away because they cannot connect with and understand how you feel, no matter how supportive they are.

I volunteer as a mental health advocate, and part of that is really just encouraging people to go get treatment. Stories like ours are a very important part of that, I think. It's not just how we feel, but how others feel around us over time.

I hope things can work out over time for the both of you."
bipolar2,fpnluzu,t3_ged2cy,1588766933.0,"Currently, there is no cure for bipolar disorder, as it is not a disease per se, but a brain that doesn't work properly to regular emotional response. There are times when it can look like it is going into remission, but this is likely just moods leveling out for a while before more cycling occurs. The length of this seems to vary...I rapid cycle, and prior to meds, I had maybe a few days each year where I felt normal, mood-wise. 

Meds have brought me to having very mild symptoms and a feeling of well-being I never really have had in my entire life, so I'm a big fan of them. I was originally diagnosed at 20 or so, and did not accept the diagnosis and did not want to be tied to take medication the rest of my life (along with all the side effects - they wanted to prescribe lithium). I thought it was just simple depression. I lived for a couple of decades after that without medication and my life was largely a train wreck, even though I did manage to get into a career and make some positive steps in my life.

As for lamotrigine, it's been great for me. The only side effect I've noticed with it is a prickly feeling when increasing the dosage, but this goes away after a couple of days of that increase. I also take an SSRI and anti-anxiety med, and it has played well with those, too. I still cycle, and tend to more often tend to be mildly hypo, but it has really reduced the intensity of cycling. There was a time after I reached full dosage that I was cycling every 2-3 days and it was very intense, but it smoothed out after that and has been relatively level. The only thing that really sucks about it is the shape of the pills, sometimes makes it a little uncomfortable to swallow."
bipolar2,fpnkqhu,t3_gdo7py,1588766001.0,"I always say that you had the illness before you got diagnosed and got on a treatment plan. Things won't be perfect, but they will slowly get better. Also, there is as much stigma as we let people have about it. I don't give a single shit what people think about me or my mental health. I don't explain it to many people because I sometimes feel like others would see it as a cry of attention, but I'm open about it with friends and coworkers who already know there's something up with me. In addition, I volunteer with a mental health advocacy organization and also work to raise mental health awareness at my company.

That said, umm, trust me, prior to meds, I could be a real not-so-fun person to be around. There is still unrepaired damage at my parents' house from times that my irritability/rage got out of hand. I've lost friendships over just random anger. I've lost count of the people I've gone off on over just stupid, random shit that didn't matter. It's not so much that you're randomly violent, but you tend to not be able to pump the brakes as easily if your hypomania is more irritable and volatile than euphoric. I'm back in a mildly hypo phase now and was finding myself to be rude and waspish on a conference call, yet also productive and super outgoing with some other virtual meeting and work stuff.

So, yeah, there is a stereotype, but there is also a grain of truth to it, even if no one wants to really bring it up. On the other hand, the right medication makes a huge difference in cutting back on all of it, so it's not something that has to be that way."
bipolar2,fpmno90,t3_gdnz4k,1588737143.0,"Don't feel bad, organic chemistry kicks everyone's ass. I'd like to tell someone where they could stuff those stupid sticks and balls.

I dropped out of college twice, and had a gap of several years before I went back. In between, I worked in blue collar jobs and trades for a while. It wasn't the end of the world, even if it felt like that at the time. It gave me some breathing room and a chance to engage in some intellectual wandering that I never would have done otherwise, as well as pointing me to another career choice and letting me work through some of the baggage I had by that point.

The other thing is that sometimes we have to adjust our expectations because of this illness. I had planned to be on a career track to being a CTO or something similar to this point. I'm not, nor will I ever be, placed in a position of any kind of responsibility for others...I can manage myself, but that's about it. I do good work and make pretty decent money, but I know I'm not stable enough, even with meds, to be ""in charge.""

If you don't make it into med school, there are other things you can get into where you can thrive, including some allied fields in healthcare.

No, this isn't the end of the world, and I'm not trying to steer you in one direction or another, just pointing out that there are other directions you can go in if this doesn't work out.

I would say it's not much different than having an alcoholic family member, in the impact on family life and dynamics. Of course, it comes with the added burden that it's hereditary and it's more than likely at least one parent has it as well.

I look at how my father tried to deal with my mother's bipolar symptoms (she was never diagnosed, but def. had symptoms). He was scared of her a lot of the time and really was at a loss most of the time on how to deal with her. It sucks and you're right - just as much needs to be done to provide for other family members who are caring for the person with bipolar."
bipolar2,fpi40yv,t1_fphfqfw,1588633228.0,"I don't personally know anyone with cyclothymia, so I'm not as familiar with how it expresses. I would guess that the dividing line between cyclothymia and bipolar is whether or not it has profound and negative effects on your life. Irritability from hypomania cost me one job and came close to costing me others, has cost me friendships, and has basically ruined my marriage.

Depression has also had a lot of serious impacts on my life, including self-medication through alcohol, socially isolating, causing me to stop things when I had a good start on them, making it impossible to have the energy to keep friendships or finish things. Psychotic depression in bipolar 2 isn't common, but it does happen.

I would guess that if you don't have those serious impacts on your life from your cycling, it's probably not bipolar. In fact, I hope it's not...not that you can't live a quality life with bipolar, but it is definitely an uphill battle most of the time. If it turns out to be bipolar, stick with your treatment plan, take your meds even if you don't feel like you need them, and be mindful about how things are going."
bipolar2,fphb2fh,t3_gd6l0p,1588618106.0,"Hmm. Depression with bipolar generally feels like a slow, brutal grind at times. It literally wears you down and wears you out. Suicidal ideation generally comes not so much from the illness itself but because you feel so smothered by it that it seems a much more attractive thing than living within the illness is. It basically robs you of your life, any joy in your life, paralyzes you at times. It brings emptiness, trying to grasp at anything to bring respite, but nothing really does. My depression at worst tends to take on psychotic features, such as tactile hallucinations (like bugs are crawling on me - I still swat at phantoms).

Hypomania can sometimes be euphoric, like the feeling of floating. Creativity flies during this time and any idea seems achievable and the greatest thing to have ever been thought of. There is no challenge I can't rise to. More often, it's extreme irritability. I'll go off on random people, throw things, break stuff. I'm volatile, simmering, and make people around me nervous. It's better for me to be alone during those times. Oddly enough, I can sometimes sleep okay during these periods, though I also sometimes will pull all nighters. Neither version of hypomania is actually pleasant and I often feel like I'm being dragged behind a runaway train with no way to get off. Oddly enough, I would rather be in a depressive state than hypomanic because of the unpredictability and inability to slow down/calm down.

(meds have dramatically improved all this...I don't reach these extremes any longer)

With regard to cycling...I rapid cycle, so it's usually 1-2 weeks hypomanic and 4-6 weeks depressive (this is a ballpark). The mood changes tend to sneak up on me a little until it becomes abundantly clear what is happening, when I either am overwhelmed by the depression or I feel the burst of irritability and energy in a way that is unmistakable.

Hope some of that helps!"
bipolar2,fph2wqk,t3_gd8jtr,1588614015.0,"As gil-loki said below, not all therapists are equal. Some are qualified to diagnose bipolar, some aren't. Typically, even if they are, they tend to consult with someone who handles more of the medical side. My therapist really doesn't spend much time talking about the biological side of things, but spends a lot more time talking over how to handle life problems resulting from bipolar."
bipolar2,fpgrf4m,t3_gdairg,1588608140.0,"It sounds like either anhedonia or depersonalization, or maybe a mix of both. Both can occur in severe depression and I have problems at times with both, where I feel like nothing's real, where I'm under water and can't breathe, like I'm looking through someone else's eyes. It very much feels like being dead already, like a ghost, and is a terrible feeling.

It has gotten better since I've been on meds, but it took several months of that for things to begin abating. Also, I take an SSRI and lamotrigine both, due to how severe my depression is. It may be that you are still experiencing some depressive symptoms that the lamotrigine isn't fully alleviating. Def. bring it up with your precriber...there's no specific treatment for anhedonia itself, but treating the condition that contributes to it can help with it as well.

Hang in there. It sucks, but it will get (slowly) better."
bipolar2,fpgp58a,t3_gdbbi3,1588606972.0,"Well, as long as your dog appreciates being spoiled...?

In all seriousness, here's a few things that help me - having all my bills due on the same day I get paid, then putting the excess of what I need for the month in a savings account or immediately paying down debt. Generally, I've found that I'm reluctant to pull from savings, however I'm feeling otherwise. Maybe it's just a weird gamey thing of seeing how much I can put in there.

Oh, and I do the obsessive shopping thing, too. For me, it's board games. I'll buy a bunch and be like, hum, I don't have time to play all these. I'm also pretty bad about outdoors and sports equipment, too (I just bought three pairs of running shoes and managed to cool down before I bought another three pairs). I think it's part of that lack of restraint of...oh, crap, I'm wasting money and I don't really need all the things I'm buying, but that's because we don't think logically about things."
bipolar2,fpf7isw,t3_gcnk76,1588563670.0,"Well, to start, bipolar is a malfunction of the prefrontal cortex, where you lose the capacity to respond with appropriate control and emotion. We tend to have other parts of the brain take care of this activity and it doesn't work out so well.

In your post, I see an awful lot of self-diagnosis. Teenage years are full of a lot of ups and downs, where little things seem huge and huge things seem little. You think you're going to live forever until something bursts that bubble. Other physical things can mimic bipolar, including anxiety, thyroid issues, and so on. I don't know how often it's done now, but when I was initially diagnosed many years ago, I was sent to an internist to rule out physical cause.

Also, depression and ADHD can mimic bipolar. When I was re-diagnosed, this was what I was originally diagnosed with. I was very happy that it wasn't bipolar, then a couple of weeks later, the therapist (who is also trained to diagnose bipolar) and the psych nurse compared notes and it was changed to bipolar. Sort of a letdown, but not a total surprise. I had a definite history of hypomania in addition to the depression, but this was something that came out in therapy, talking about my past personal history, plus my therapist had seen me in both depressive hypomanic states. (as an aside, I have mild distractable ADHD and anxiety in addition to BP2)

It's not to dismiss your concerns, but rather to get you to think a little more broadly about these symptoms and not overlook something else that may be serious in favor of the easy answer. The other thing is confirmation bias can cause us to focus on things which reinforce, rather than contradict, what we feel is correct. For most of my adult life, I felt like the manic depressive diagnosis was incorrect, and it was just chronic depression. I focused on that alone, and missed the signs of hypomania even though I often felt like I was ""flying"" and irritable and all that good stuff.

I sometimes have euphoric hypomania. I feel like I'm high when it happens, like everything is perfect, like colors pop out and nothing can be wrong, and everything is melting away. I sometimes get winning ideas that will make me billions and go spend a bunch of money researching it, talking people into helping me, working like a beast for a couple of weeks...until it all falls apart. Or it's more often irritability. I curse at traffic and lean on the horn, go off on random people, punch things, throw things, pick something. It is bad enough that everything gets blurry and I shake with rage. It has cost me friends and relationships and jobs.

Depression feels like a wet, heavy blanket thrown over me. When it comes on, I feel like I'm trapped in an elevator that is going down fifty stories and not stopping. I can only lay down and not move until it passes, until I'm a little more functional but despondent. Everything is hopeless and pointless and sad. I can feel it coming on and hate every minute of it.

I'm better now that I'm on meds, but I still cycle now and then, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.

Couple of more random thoughts - bipolar tends to run in families. If you don't have a close relative who has bipolar, or at least bipolar symptoms, it tends to be less likely that you have bipolar. My mother was never diagnosed with it, but clearly had a lot of symptoms. I also have relatives who have showed signs of it, and one relative who took their own life and was also clearly struggling with mental health issues.

Also, I started showing symptoms when I was very young, maybe four or five. I was not functional as a child and teen, though no one really knew to look for it in kids back then.

Hope some of that helps. If it turns out to be BP2, it'll be okay. If it's not bipolar, I'll be happy for you. I don't think any of us would ever want this, but most of have learned to live with it."
bipolar2,fpezrja,t1_fpew7hn,1588558498.0,"No worries on the question! I think it's a great one. Too often, there's a lot of focus on the person who has the mental illness, not the effect it has on the people who are around them, be they family, s/o, co-worker, etc. The people around us sometimes suffer significantly as well. My mother likely had bipolar as well (mental health issues run in our family, lot of failed lives, some suicide, etc), and my father struggled for a long time to deal with her changes in mood, aggressive and volatile behavior, and so on. It also did not make for a fun childhood.

Again, yes, be proactive here. You're in an untenable situation, and it will be less tenable as time goes on. If you lose your chance to go to law school, this is going to have lifelong ramifications that will only aggravate these issues if you two don't break out. On the other hand, the fact that you feel so torn about this shows that you do care about it. One other point, if you feel like you're forced into the role of being her caretaker, then you're going to feel resentment at some point, not love.

Feel free to stop back here anytime and talking, or PM me, whatever. This sub is not just for us who have bipolar but also for people with questions and concerns. As for stigma, I'm relatively open about my illness (though not in the details). However, I do not feel at all like that was where you were coming from - you have a serious personal issue you're looking for guidance on from a community that can help."
bipolar2,fpey8uw,t3_gbxxky,1588557538.0,"(spoiler is a lot of talking about suicidal ideation)

>!Funny anecdote from a while back...before I was correctly diagnosed with BP2 (I thought it was just severe depression), I was musing out loud to a couple of co-workers that I did not understand why people would commit suicide. If you life go to that point, where you had no hope, you lived in a state of total freedom because the assumption that most people labor under - that their actions have great meaning and that they always need to prepare for the future - is gone completely out the window. You could just say fuck it and go be a beach bum, live in a tent in the woods, whatever the hell you wanted to do, because in your minds, you were already dead.!<

>!I got the ""I don't think that's really how people with depression feel..."" conversation with them. Of course, they didn't know about all the times I'd sat down to write out suicide notes and was only alive because I was never happy with how incomplete they felt, or chambered a round and sat with a gun under my chin, just trying to find a reason not to do it and feeling so hopeless that not even suicide would matter or not matter, or sat and carved bloody designs in my arms and legs because I was so numb that not even pain seemed real, and so on.!<

>!But, I think it started me down the road to at least having something to grasp at when things got bad, the idea of accepting that I was already dead and that living at that point forward was simply because I chose to and didn't care if I lived or died. I'd felt that way on a less conscious level for a long time, but codifying it at least gave me enough of a lifeline until I finally got around to being diagnosed and getting on medication that drove a stake through the suicidal ideation. (sometimes, I find myself wishing it would come back, because it feels like an old friend that I miss...weird as that sounds, sometimes the meds make me feel like things are just covered up, not gone)!<

>!In the end, I think what comforted me most was just knowing that I didn't have to feel trapped by this, that there was another way out. But, more than that, was being comforted that if suicide seemed attractive, then all the little things which people sweated Simply. Did. Not. Matter. Anymore. Oh, hey, you didn't get the promotion at work? So sorry, but I was trying to decide between jumping off a bridge or cutting my wrists. Eh, you say your car broke down? I was thinking of disabling the air bag on mine and driving it into an abutment at one hundred miles per hour. Once you believe and effectively accept that you're dead, you see things and live in ways that people who are afraid of it will never know. It's obviously not ideal, but it's a different take on being suicidal that sometimes people who feel trapped by this illness maybe haven't always considered.!<

>!Last, I'll say that I don't know you personally, but have seen you around and posting before, and have appreciated where you're coming from. I'd be sad if you were gone, so stay with us, please.!<"
bipolar2,fpewdsd,t3_gbwyqc,1588556388.0,"I used to self-medicate with alcohol for a long time before I was correctly diagnosed with BP2. After some real hiccups in life that couldn't be easily fixed, I found myself drinking even more and getting seriously suicidal. Finally started reading up on how alcohol abuse could cause suicidal ideation to be aggravated, I managed to get off of it for a while (backslid later on, but finally quit for good when my spouse threatened to live if I didn't quit). I craved it for a while (this was before I got on meds), but it wasn't alcoholism...I just could not take the highs and lows without something, anything, to alleviate them. Since getting on meds, it completely took that ""need"" away from me to where I have no problem avoiding it, so it doesn't mess with my meds or mood. I had one sip of wine not too long ago when my spouse wanted me to try this new bottle they opened, but that was it and I was like ""cool"" and moved on.

bipolar2,fperies,t3_gd05uh,1588553397.0,"That's a real toughie. 

I have bipolar 2 and have been married for over a decade. Long before we ever started dating, I was diagnosed as manic depressive, but never accepted the diagnosis and figured it was normal depression. (at the time, I think there was a lot less awareness of hypomania vs. mania and my behavior did not rise to the level of true mania, so the lack of distinction was a problem). Maybe if I'd accepted and been treated when I was younger, things would have been a lot different.

To be honest, I deeply regret getting married. It's not that I don't love my spouse, not that I don't treasure the good times we've had, but my bipolar has systematically, methodically wrecked our relationship and marriage, and made their life hell so many times. My behavior and moods have been getting better since I've been medicated (and keeping adjusting up to where it needs to be, not there yet), but there has been so much damage done by now that trying to patch things up has been one step forward, one step back. It's not been fair to them to have to deal with this, to have had to deal with the black moods on one hand, and the irritability and anger on the other.

I can't imagine being on the other side of this, trying to deal with a person when you never know what the next shoe to drop is going to be, or what mood they're going to be in from one week to the next, or what irrational behavior you're going to have to deal with next. I don't know how someone stays married to a person with bipolar, either. I've lost count of the times when my spouse has in desperation said that they're going to leave and how many times I've begged and pleaded and said I'm sorry and that I'll change my behavior, when I didn't know that there was no way I could (this was prior to medication). Some time ago, around the same time I was getting re-diagnosed, I said that I understood and would not fight any decision they made, but support it. What else can you do when you're at rock bottom?

I have a friend who has BP1. They are divorced because of it.

Another thing is, you can't control whether or not a person harms themselves. Around twenty percent of people with bipolar 2 eventually wind up being victims of suicide (victimized by a disease that doesn't allow us to realistically and rationally look at situations). Suicidal ideation runs deep in many people with bipolar...I've sat down and started composing suicide notes, with the only thing saving me is that I couldn't figure out what all I wanted to say in them. It doesn't really matter what you do, you can't reach into someone's brain and make them better, how much you love them or they love you. OUR BRAINS SIMPLY DO NOT WORK RIGHT. I can't begin to emphasize that enough. If you leave, she may self-harm. If you don't leave, she may self-harm. It's beyond your control and beyond hers, too.

Honestly, it feels like you're desperate at this point, which seems to be the position a lot of people are in with their SO having bipolar. You're having to be a caretaker when you're not equipped for it. Here's my thoughts -

* You can't take care of someone else if your own life is in shambles. It's like the thing about a parent putting their oxygen mask on in a plane before putting it on their kid.
* You cannot fix her bipolar, just like she herself cannot fix it. It's a treatable, not a curable, condition.
* You don't know how to deal with this situation. Do you know how to rebuild the engine in your car or do your own brain surgery? Nope, go talk to an expert. If she is currently seeing a therapist (and I hope she is), then go see if you can see the therapist together. Optionally, go see one yourself and see what you can do to deal with the situation.
* Is she fully compliant with her treatment plan? The fact that she is cycling that much makes me think she is not necessarily getting the right meds or is taking them consistently. Both are huge problems for people with bipolar, particularly the latter. We get meds, we think we're feeling fine, we convince ourselves that we don't have bipolar and it was just us being moody, so we quit them and things fall apart again.
* Also, remember that some situations cannot be fixed, no matter how much we might want to fix them. If you find that you cannot support her or cannot commit to life with a person who has a mental illness, it's better to figure this out now and end things before your lives are more entangled. Again, this is where maybe you seeing a therapist to know how to navigate that without causing more harm to her is crucial. I won't go into the ethics or morality of that decision. We all want to pretend we can take on the world, but sometimes we find ourselves in over our heads, and this is one of the worst mental illnesses for people to deal with.
* Maybe there is also a need to have an honest discussion about the impact that this is having on your life. It seems like people often tiptoe around the impact that mental illness in a partner has on them because they are afraid of upsetting them. Again, this should be facilitated by a professional to keep it from getting acrimonious.

You have my sympathies. You sound like a decent person who is in a situation you don't know how to manage. If you decide to work it out, and figure out how to help her care for herself, you may find yourself in a stronger relationship than people who have not crossed these kinds of bridges have. If it does not work out, remember that this is a mental illness that is difficult to treat and live with, and not just someone being ""dramatic"" or some other nonsense people not in the know think it is."
bipolar2,fpemj54,t3_gcw8hh,1588550433.0,"I think it's more typical that people having a hypomanic episode may wind up getting arrested for reckless/rash behavior, rather than being hospitalized."
bipolar2,fpelr4w,t3_gcwowy,1588550002.0,"As other posters have stated, teleconferencing is an option. My therapist is doing in person visits for people who want to do that, my prescriber is doing video conferencing. Funny true story, I didn't get the memo that she was doing them, so I showed up at the office at the appointed time. I waited, waited a few, called her office, called her call phone, nothing. Finally, she sent me a text with the video link, wondering why I wasn't on. I was like, umm...I'm standing outside? She's cool, so she saw me in person anyway. :D

As for the rest...the key thing is to remember that you had the issues prior to being diagnosed. You're not ""crazy,"" everyone else isn't crazy, it isn't just ""how you are"" and all the other rationalizations that seem to come up (at least they did for me). If nothing more, that will hopefully give you enough understanding and grounding to tide you over until you can get back in or do video conference with your pdoc until then. 

People feel a little weirded out at times about being diagnosed, partly because they are worried about what others think and partly because of the ramifications of being told they're going to live the rest of their life with what is essentially a broken brain. However, what you feel/think about your diagnosis is something that is basically up to you. I think you have a very healthy way of looking at it, though - that you can finally put a name to what has been causing a lot of pain in your life and start working on a care plan to alleviate it.

From the research I've read - and someone please correct me if this is outdated - bipolar is a result of the prefrontal cortex in the brain not working correctly. The frontal cortex is what is responsible for rational decision making and putting a brake on impulsive behavior. We rely more heavily on other parts of our brain for decision making, which tends to mean we are less rational in how we think and act times. 

As for what to expect as far as treatment goes, it varies a lot from person to person. At a minimum, it'll likely be getting prescribed a mood stabilizer. If your depression is severe, you might get an SSRI prescribed along with that. I have GAD along with BP2, so I take an anti-anxiety med along with lamotrigine (mood stabilizer) and paroxtene (for depression). I have mild ADHD, but I don't medicate for that because it's not inhibiting anything and meds for that might be a problem with the BP2."
bipolar2,fog80n0,t3_g706d5,1587749118.0,"I got started on a 100mg dose (with the usual ramp-up time of smaller doses). My prescriber is bumping it to 150mg or 200mg shortly.

bipolar2,fog72ps,t3_g6zwr4,1587748758.0,"I'd bring it up, honestly. It's something everyone feels at some point. When I was first diagnosed, a long, long time ago, my decision to walk away from any kind of treatment had a lot to do with not feeling like I wanted to be dependent on meds. It was a really, really bad decision and one I wish I could do all over again.

Now that I'm older, I have around zero desire to get off meds. Things aren't perfect, but they are a whole lot better than they used to be. I've lived both with and without meds, and am not an advocate of going without them. It's just not worth it, especially when we have good treatment options.

I am a mental health advocate at my company, and do some volunteering with a mental health organization, and have found people to be very receptive these days to conversations about it and supporting it.

There are a handful of people at my company who knows I have bp2. A few were like ""huh, wot dat?"" and some others were familiar with it. I don't really care who knows and who doesn't...more than anything, I get a little tired of having to explain it, so I don't talk with too many people about it for that reason. The upside is that everyone I've talked to has been super supportive and helpful in dealing with it. They know I will need to take off now and then, or will have a bad day, or days when I stay up working overnight because I can't stop, or that my sleep will be badly messed up at times. They also know I take meds that really zap me from 10:30 to 11:30 or so.

It'll be okay. It took me longer to get through college than I wanted. I also had some good profs who were willing to give me some extra help, even though I wasn't aware of/accepting of my diagnosis at that point in time.

* No mood stabilizer is truly free of side effects or issues. Lamotrigine, which is what I take, has the risk of a life-threatening rash if you have a reaction to it. Other than that, it's fine...except it sometimes messes with your digestive system.
* Side effects tend to wear off or reduce as time goes on and your body gets used to it. I had bad dry mouth early on with some of my meds, but that's gone away.
* Not everyone responds to meds the same way and some can be on smaller dosages to have a significant effect. Genetic testing can reveal who is best suited for what med, too. For example, my dose of lamotrigine is at the bottom end of what is considered a therapeutic dose, but has worked well so far.
* I spent 2+ decades trying to convince myself that I didn't have bipolar after being diagnosed with manic depression at around 20-21 (I've shown symptoms of it most of my life, since maybe 4 or 5). It's common for people to have difficulty accepting it or feeling like an imposter with it, and the meds make it worse because we start feeling normal.
* People react to the diagnosis in different ways. For me, getting (re)diagnosed was a relief, because it meant I could finally address what has caused so much trouble in my life in so many ways.
* You will likely still cycle some, but it will be at a much milder intensity. If you rapid cycle now, you might experience more but much milder cycling (this has been my experience at least).

Hang in there. It's a lot to take in, but as time goes on, you'll be more at ease with it, understand the illness better, and know how to care for yourself. I always say that you had the problem before, but now you have a name for it, have a treatment plan, and can begin living a better life!"
