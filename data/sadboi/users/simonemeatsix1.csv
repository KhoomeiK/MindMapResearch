diet,fnwqy9j,t1_fnwp0l0,1587323711.0,"Coffee really kills my appetite, I drink like 4-5 a day and could probably not eat because of this!! But loss of appetite is probably because you aren’t using much energy in the day, and maybe the anxiety of what is going on in the world currently! I have found my appetite is not the same at all, unless I work out and I do get hungry. 

I find making smoothies is a nice way to get your nutrients and I always want a smoothie even if I’m not too hungry so maybe try having one for breakfast or lunch then try and eat normal for the rest of the day :)"

WeightLossAdvice,fm66bxh,t3_ft8u4d,1585787222.0,Body dysmorphia by the sounds of it. When I lost weight I began to focus on my body so much I didn’t even really know what I looked like anymore. Even when I was underweight I still thought I looked huge! Doing some weight exercises may help change how you feel about yourself?
diet,fm5k4sf,t3_fsyr6q,1585774443.0,"You’ll lose weight if you’re in a calorie deficit, but you’ll feel like shit if you eat the calories from junk food. Eating protein, veg & healthy foods keeps you full longer and also doesn’t make you feel like you’re gonna pass out!!

I think a big thing about eating disorders is that you always compare yourself to others. from experience the longer you leave it and don't talk to anyone the worse it gets. I hope you get the help you need!!
