The idea is a competition where PCs will be matched each with an enemy NPC that they have to fight and it's frowned upon to have help from party members but they can receive tips as they're fighting and its not completely against the rules to receive help. Anyway, NPCs will level with players until all enemies are dead and all quests are accomplished. In regards to leveling them to not be completely impossible to fight, some enemies are supposed to be difficult and something PCs will need help with while others might be easy to defeat. With this in mind, how low and high should I level them in comparison to PC levels?"
