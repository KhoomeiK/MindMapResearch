SuicideWatch,fpqj7ux,t3_geqgji,1588824057.0,"I grew up in a family like yours. I've heard those same things. Part of years of my therapy was dismantling those sayings like ""Everyone hates working"" to realize those statements weren't true. If your parents are like my parents, they might be especially prone to say those types of things when they themselves are having a difficult day, and they might seem to contradict themselves by saying on another day that ""working isn't so bad."" It feel like you're experiencing whiplash. It might feel like they're revealing how they really feel when they say ""working sucks,"" and that when they say otherwise, they're just trying to look at things through rose-colored glasses to cheer you up and encourage you to go forth in the world. That they don't know how to get out of the system themselves, but know they should encourage you to go in it yourself, because that's how the system keeps running. But like I said, this is just not how things work, and it is not true. Instead, it seems that most people are about neutral in how they feel about their jobs. Your working life generally gets better the more you do it. It has its ups and downs, but over time, it generally improves. And the rewards are good rewards -- encountering new friends, gaining the ability to do more things that bring you the more euphoric moments in life like travel, etc.

The beginning jobs often do feel difficult, but that's also normal to feel that way. However you feel, know that you're not doing anything wrong at your age. I think you're making great progress from what you describe. Your future already holds better rewards because of your efforts now. There's no going back to square one -- there's only progress, and you're making it.

So however loving your parents are, please know that your parents' attitudes aren't your future. Neither ""everyone hates working"" nor ""your work should feel like love"" is true. I identify with what you described and went through this job-holding difficulty due to disabilities like depression myself, even the same kind of antidepressant-and-suddenly-I'm-keeping-a-job circumstance you describe. So, I'm really hoping you don't have to make the same mistakes I did in believing my parents when they said things like that. 

Instead, it's really great that you have self-awareness and that you are looking out for the best in yourself. That means that you'll continue to make sure that your emotional needs are being taken care of. Wherever you in this moment, I'm dearly hoping the best for you. Both for how you feel now, and for your future."
SuicideWatch,fpbub8z,t1_fpawh6z,1588478912.0,"Damn, that sounds really harsh. I'm so sorry to hear that. Even asking for closure and not getting it -- that has to be tough to go through.

But I have to say, it made me smile to read the last paragraph you wrote here. You acknowledge how things could have been worse -- but thankfully, they weren't. Your resilience really shines.

(Side note: In fact, you employed a powerful technique often used by an ancient group of people called the Stoics, who sought to live their best lives by minimizing negative emotions and maximizing positive emotions. One of their major techniques is just as what you did here. You actively imagined how your scenario could be worse, but instead of dwelling on it, you flipped the script by realizing that the worst scenario -did not- happen. Instead of being succumbed to thought that what just happened is the worst thing ever, you instilled meaning into this circumstance, and instead became grateful. You've built character from it, becoming more resilient to future hardships that come your way.

)

I really wish things could have been easier for you here, and that things weren't so confusing, but I'm glad to see that you're moving on in a healthy way. You seem to be implicitly using the painful heat of this hardship as a forge to strengthen yourself. Because of this experience, I think that you will only have more to offer to whoever you end up being with.

It's a tough thing to say, but as time goes on, I might even recommend unfollowing her on social media (if you haven't already). That phrase 'unfollow her' sounds harsher than it is -- you're not breaking any connection, and can still check up on her activity if you want. It's just a private action. But I say this because being able to see her activity again and again is likely exacerbating your own feelings of suffering and loneliness. If you're waiting for anything, I think you're waiting for a direct message. That doesn't require seeing all her posts. (I limit my own social media use in the same way, and don't follow most of my friends' activity. Something about seeing so many conversations and yet not being a direct, meaningful participant in those conversations seems to plant little seeds of loneliness that grow over time. Social media use is known to cause suffering for this reason. It's one of its drawbacks.) 

So if you're following her, then given this circumstance and your pain, I might keep this in mind as something to consider. Unfollowing (particularly if you can do so privately, such as with Facebook's 'unfollow but stay friends' feature) likely only has benefits for you. I think you've done your part in being concerned, in being a watchful eye, in trying to be there for her. This step is almost guaranteed to reduce some of your stress, and could help you out a lot.

I'm wishing for you some easier times ahead. I'm also wishing for you that you continue to move through this hardship with the self-compassion you've been showing. You are doing such a great job."
SuicideWatch,foikvd3,t3_g7nb0a,1587789224.0,"The recipe for wanting to commit suicide is:
1. Numbness to pain (including emotional pain)

As far as diagnosis, that's perfectly okay. However, if you ever do go out to get diagnoses, they usually (by law) cannot make you unable to do certain things. The only exception to this, I think, might be employment to certain sections of the army. In other words, only some extremely specific stuff that most people never encounter.
Depending on where you live, this might change. I'm referring to the US + Canada when I say all this, since I only know those countries. Many people across the world have at least one diagnosis and disability, and so the world is fairly well attuned to accept that without judgment these days. :)"
SuicideWatch,fo1owgz,t3_g56qrd,1587438085.0,"This was all intelligently explained and the level of detail you wove in to explain your situation demonstrates that you have a healthy emotional understanding of your situation. It's encouraging to see that you can do that. Nothing felt or seemed stupid to me. :)

It breaks my heart to hear about all that you're going through. It's okay to feel less impacted as you think you should be from seeing your mom hurt by your dad like that. That's already a difficult scenario for anyone of any age to comprehend happening. And at age 5, it might not have sunk in the way it would for someone much older. Not every traumatic event has to be processed as a traumatic event, and that's really okay. In fact, it's better that way, since you were saved further pain. However you think and feel about it is the correct way, because it's honest to yourself! 

You're right that depression often pops up around that age, and is associated with thinking those thoughts and feeling those emotions. Many people share your experience, as I did at that age.

You're right that self-diagnosis is difficult. I had a hard time doing it even when I was studying neuroscience in school. Eventually, I went to a psychiatrist to figure out for sure that I had depression and some other things like ADHD. No shame in trying! You only gain more knowledge about the world and yourself in it.

I'm really touched by you wanting to do the right thing for yourself and for other people, but you are going through so much. That takes a lot of endurance and courage and makes you out to be a wonderful person. You even want to love this girl, and I think it's okay for you to explore it if you think she's healthy for you to be in a relationship with. 

Thoughts about killing yourself and fears about being pushed in a way where you might kill yourself one day are also common. It seems like you really want the best for yourself and that matters a lot. 

Lastly, I am so sad to hear about your best friend. I'm hoping that whatever happens to her, you can continue to reach out to people who care about you. I'm hoping the best for her, and I'm hoping the best for you."
SuicideWatch,fo1lkrk,t1_fnukg00,1587435958.0,"Hey, good to hear from you. 
I'm really happy that you feel attached to her in a loving way. That's a beautiful description. I'm glad you've had such experiences with her like that.

As you said, you're right, things are uncertain. It's all up in the air, and you seem to have a healthy disposition about it.

Your reasoning all makes sense to me. It seems that you really care about her, as has been obvious. It also seems you care about yourself, which is reassuring.

Acceptance of whatever comes in each moment is definitely the best way to go, and you seem to be going there. (At its extreme, the acceptance of every moment without fail for days/weeks in one stretch would be (the fable of) nirvana.) It's encouraging to hear that you're moving in further positive directions for yourself.

You can only share your strength so long as you continue to take care of yourself and that strength. I'm hoping you can continue to keep yourself moving in a positive direction through this as you have been. If there are more things to accept that have yet to come your way, I'm wishing for you the ability to continue to move through this with as much strength and peace as possible. :)"

SuicideWatch,fnc3yge,t1_fna8z9v,1586828111.0,"No problem, I'm happy to be here for you!

Yeah, the way you describe it sounds like you're ready to move on. I agree. I also think your message to her was very appropriate and gave the right balance of everything. It showed how you were hanging in there and willing to be there for her, but that it's not feasible to do this forever and that you might move on soon if you don't get at least a little feedback to know what's going on. I think it's a good message.

But afterward, in describing how you feel, I would be careful about some of the thoughts you're starting to have -- ""my love/care/concern were too much for her"", ""her actions have been selfish/emotionally abusive"". Don't get me wrong, this is totally okay to feel that way. It's really important to be honest about how you feel, as it only helps you develop further. The possibility of her ghosting certainly gives credence to the relationship being rocky at times.

However, I only point out your word choice in those instances because your own happiness could be at jeopardy if these thoughts aren't acknowledged. The vulnerability and love you were expressing before might start turning toward shades of anger and resentment, which is a natural response to many kinds of breakup, especially ghosting scenarios. Absolutely normal to go there. 

But as I mentioned, be sure to keep an eye on it. Letting any shade of that anger grow inside you will only lead to further heartbreak of your own. While the emotion of ""oh, fuck this"" is helpful in quickly mentally distancing yourself from her, it also distances you a bit from yourself -- from the reality of the well-wishing you had for her before. Your memories of her still live inside you and will always be a part of your history. If you become too resentful toward her, then anytime you experience one of those memories, its value is threatened to be washed-over by the red coat of your newly present ill-feelings. Since your memories live inside you, in a way, you'll feel resentful toward yourself.
 
It doesn't seem to me that you're fully there, but I would feel awful for you if you began to feel that way! So I just wanted to point out those words. With ghosting or ghosting-like scenarios, I think it is especially easy to go this way -- to feel like a chum for having stuck along for so long. Make sure to acknowledge those emotions as they appear to you so that your own self-compassion ends up shining brighter through this. 

Additionally, I think it is worth never forgetting that she really could have been (or be) in pain and that you were sticking around in the hopes of helping her. The title you gave in opening up to r/suicidewatch about this was ""Worried about my suicidal girlfriend"". How awful would it have been if you immediately came to the conclusion she was ghosting, but she wasn't and really needed your help? Thank goodness you responded in the way you did.

Nonetheless, you were given no feedback to know for sure, but you did know that she had a history of major depression, anxiety, and suicidality before. Your decision to stick around for this was a good, logical decision. In fact, as odd as it sounds, her not continuing on with the relationship is perhaps one of the best outcomes here. She is still alive, and that is something to be grateful for, regardless of how the relationship between you two play out. Your outreach may or may not have played a role in her being alive now, but it likely helped instill in her the feeling that people cared about her. Even if you are no longer in a relationship with her from this, you might still have played a role in reducing her suffering at a critical time in the future. These feelings and memories add up.

Further, her side of the relationship needn't be black and white. It could be grey, where she is still suffering and in 'retreat' mode, but also not feeling the courage to end the relationship officially. Perhaps there were issues in the relationship that you two never discovered between yourselves. Perhaps this, in itself, is an issue -- that she might not be as willing to be meet you eye-to-eye in the relationship. Flowing, honest communication is required for a healthy relationship. 

Who's to say. Since she suffers from depression and anxiety, she isn't exactly put on even playing-grounds with everyone else when it comes to being vulnerable. As I mentioned earlier, it's not worth blaming her. It's only worth acknowledging it for what it is: that you feel spent and want to move on.

If you do end up encountering a relationship with her in the future, I'd say take that as it appears. Who knows if that would ever happen, and you needn't think about it too much now. You won't be exactly the same person you are now, and she won't be either. Nonetheless, the main thing to address would be this moment of non-communication, and I don't think you would forget to mention that. For now, think however you need to feel to move forward in your life and reduce your own suffering. If that means thinking that you would never be in a relationship with her again, that's okay too. On one hand, the relationship had its wonderful periods, but it also was grounds for your suffering at other times. Only your judgment call can determine if the positives outweigh all the negatives, including the new negatives you are experiencing now. It's perfectly okay to accept that the negatives now outweigh the positives for any reason, while simultaneously being happy that you had the relationship with her.

I'm so sorry that this turned out to feel a bit shitty. With the social media posts and her parents, I don't know anyone who would be able to process this well on their own. I really commend you for reaching out. I'm hoping that whatever you choose to do, you can find your own sense of closure. You've reached out to her in a very mature way and I applaud you for that. I hope you can continue to move through this as maturely and gracefully as you have. But most importantly, I hope you find more peace for yourself soon. 


P.S. If you do officially end this relationship in some way, then I hope it doesn't stigmatize depression or other related disabilities for you. Personality and depression act in mysterious ways. It's always worth pointing out that someone's depression gives them harder odds to succeed in most areas of their life, and they need more compassion for that. But that also doesn't mean that they have the right personality for you when things get tough. Many people with depression are excellent communicators, while others aren't. Sometimes this is because of depression and sometimes it's not. The science isn't quite there yet to figure out how to isolate depression and figure out how it interacts with each person's personality. 
So, depression is not a dealbreaker that always makes relationships harder. There are always more important things that factor into a good fit. :)"
SuicideWatch,fmxw9pc,t1_fmwq7p2,1586473126.0,"Hey, thanks for feeling open to reach out! I was hoping things might be going okay for you and her.

Yeah, that's the hardest feedback to work with: no feedback. I really couldn't say. Your guess is probably better than mine. 

On my side, you've definitely done your time in trying to be there for her. If you reason out that she's breaking up with you, that's a reasonable assessment. It's not like it's only been a few days, and 3 weeks is a good chunk of time. I agree with your assessment that it could be the end. There's a benefit to holding on as long as you can, but there's also an emotional consequence of letting your heart be strung along for too long. You did the right choice here and it was a show of great character. Definitely admirable and a very valuable thing for yourself and whoever you share your life with. 

But whatever reason is telling you right now, go with that. You've been with her for awhile and have a better intuition than I could. Being in line with your reason will bring about a feeling of 'acceptance', which could bring sorrow and other things, but definitely know you've done the best you could with all the information you had (and specifically, didn't have).

I'm not sure if this is helpful to say, since moving on should really feel like moving on I think, but 
1) if you move on from this relationship here, I wouldn't be too caught up about it being the end for good. It's not like you have a girlfriend lined up for tomorrow and once you move on today, you're automatically closed from the relationship since you're in a new one now. If you think it's the end, and in a week she finally responds, I imagine you might be able to talk things out with her and see where it goes. 
But still...
2) losing the anticipation her responding is probably the key thing to do to fully 'move on' from this, since it's a behavior that isn't giving you any clues as to if it would ever end. So you might still feel like you're in the relationship if you hang on to that. 

At the very least, you seem to be telling me that it's at least worth considering that she might never respond. I can't say for sure, as no one could here. But I hope you can take care of yourself enough to mentally abandon the project if it's starting to take a very big toll on you and your well-being.

I can say that what will help yourself through this is looking for any other avenues of reassurance that you're valued and loved by other people. Whether it's your own family or other friends, it doesn't have to be at the same caliber of love. But just something to make sure you feel noticed by someone in a significant way, however small that is, when you're not getting any feedback. That's a definite need to keep aware of. As much as you're doing this for her, this need is the one you're probably looking to fulfill in talking to people about this -- reassurance that you're doing the right thing, that you're maintaining your value as a person for doing this. I think you are. Certainly keep yourself reassured here, and keep yourself open to your friends and others who love you.

Whatever you feel through this will be okay. I've said it from the start, but you're doing your best with the information you have here, and that's all you can do, no matter what you decide or how things turn out."

SuicideWatch,fmk6ynv,t1_fmk002d,1586146139.0,"Yeah. We can only ever be one person with a hose trying to put out a village on fire. The goal here is to contribute as much as you can to reduce the magnitude of each crisis. There’s no way one person can save the whole village. But this doesn’t change the fact that you, with your hose, slowed down some fires enough for people to escape their current crisis, reducing injury and potentially saving lives. If you weren’t there, more people would have suffered. More third degree burns, more untreated scarring, more deaths. But the fact you tried even for a minute, anywhere, means there is less suffering than there would have been. That’s all you can do. Whatever you can handle is always enough.

It’s never going to be an issue with you, personally (though, of course, it’s important to prepare a little bit so that you know not to spray your hose on an oil fire and make things worse or on an electrical fire and injure yourself. The Q+A and guidelines on the side of the subreddit are really, really great for this.) You’re only doing a positive thing. Loneliness and suicide is largely a numbers issue, so don’t feel bad for feeling like you have to triage. If you feel bad about it, it will be an unsustainable feeling and you’ll get exhausted in the long run. Instead, I think it’s important to acknowledge that whoever you choose to help is someone that might otherwise get no help at all. It could be worse for them, but it wasn’t. You were there. You tried. It’s always positive in that way."
SuicideWatch,fmjnfjh,t3_fvmqz5,1586133859.0,"First of all, I’m so sorry you’re going through so much pain. This is really difficult to process. It seems perfectly okay to be confused from this. I think many of us are. How can you have one intention so often and yet find yourself doing something else? 

The recipe for suicide is (numbness to pain and death) + (feeling like a burden) + (loneliness). These three things are all created by experiencing strong negative emotions and circumstances over time, but loneliness comes and goes. It’s very manipulatable and can go away as quickly as it comes. 

Depression is a condition in which these things pop up quite often in your experience. You feel awful and a waste of space and it can feel so empty, or you can feel so numb and that in itself can feel terrible. However, these difficult experiences aren’t sufficient for wanting to take your own life. They are only the kindling of a potential bonfire. Loneliness is the match that sets it all off toward suicide.

When you tell someone your plans, you’re directly responding to the onus of your suicidal feelings and thoughts. While many different types of thought can pop up when pondering suicide, -feeling- lonely is always there when someone wants to die. When you share your story and your plans, you let someone into your life in an intimate way. You share your vulnerability. You become far less lonely. You might even feel a little hope, however fleeting it might seem. You’re not just protecting yourself, you’re treating yourself directly, becoming less lonely and feeling better. 

By posting here in this subreddit, you’re helping yourself. You’re letting people into your life. You’re seeing how you’re definitely not alone in this, no matter how alone you feel.

You might also ask if you could redo those problems, since you answered them and then realized that they are about a lesson she never taught you. You would like an opportunity to learn the material properly and then give it your honest shot. (This is worth asking, but I would wager it is a 50/50 chance whether she'd grant the re-do. It would be helpful if she actually did it though! May as well try.)

It's really great you're taking your grades so seriously. As a student who strove for As throughout schooling myself, it does help to go for the A, as it makes some things in life easier. However, I made the mistake for too long that grades were commenting on my worth as a person in some indirect way. It's definitely easy to see a 90% and think subconsciously ""I'm 90% of what I could be."" As you're seeing now, this percentage is totally at the whim of whatever your teacher sets up. Their teaching style could be very flawed at moments. But it doesn't mean you're flawed. A lot of this is random and you can only do your best, which is who you are in every moment. That's always 100%. :)

So sorry you're going through this. I'm hoping you can get a grade you're satisfied with here. It sounds very unfair, and so it's likely that other people in your class are struggling too.

SuicideWatch,fm7ikah,t3_ftkp8f,1585828231.0,"Hey, yeah. I’ve used it plenty of times over many years. They are helpful and worth calling. They’re good at what they do — reducing the suffering you’re going through.

Being afraid of being called an ambulance to you is a very understandable fear, and it is perhaps the most common one in calling the hotline. However, they really restrain themselves from having to do it. For them to call anyone, there is a big difference between “I have a plan I might carry out any day now” and “I have a plan for 5 minutes from now.” Only if they’re sure you are actively dying or have a lot to suggest you are about to die — and would be helped by an ambulance — will they call one. It rarely happens. They know that the best way to save you is not to violate your trust. It’s only a last result measure when you meet the right-now-I’m-dying-or-about-to criteria. It’s physical criteria, not emotional. 

I’ve always felt better when calling them. You get some new people who are helpful but nothing amazing sometimes, and you get some jawdroppingly helpful people sometimes. Generally it’s in between — they’re just quite good.

If you didn’t like a conversation you had, you can always call again, likely getting someone else. If you live in the US, they are serviced all around the United States, and the person you talk to is anyone available from any center in the country.

No shame for calling! Once you do it once, you’ll likely feel better in knowing that there’s a new option for you when you’re feeling lonely and are in pain."

It’s different than anyone else saying it, and so they have more impact on how you feel. But if they truly knew you better, they would understand how to help you accomplish your goal of feeling better, and it seems they have failed largely at that. 

Your words speak to a lot of resentment toward this person but also a pull-and-tug between an endeavor to be free of their influence and an exhausted effort to do so. Additional, you seem clear-headed in knowing these thoughts to be awful for you, but the toughest part is how they make you feel. And so it’s built up to feeling helpless and abused. I think you make that clear, and I’m so very sorry it’s been happening to you. The others who read your post will understand this and feel that way too, because your pain is so relatable.

No shame here, and in fact there’s no shame for not having a different life, one with different experiences that would have let you know more. No one chooses any of this, so I hear you. For forgetting how to communicate to people, you’ve made a very clear message that is easy to read. :)

Generally, you can explain your situation to the receptionist. You can explain you’re looking for mental health help but don’t know how to go about it. Ask him/her to direct you to the appropriate person.
It’s a good chance you would see your general practitioner and they would help find you a therapist and/or psychiatrist. Your standard, everyday family doctor is often connected like that. They might ask if you want to be treated with medication right then and there (after you explain your symptoms to him/her, if you want to), but that’s up to you. Often you’re better off seeing a psychiatrist first, who typically meets with you briefly and recommends/prescribes any medication you might want. But if you don’t want to try medication or anything, no worries at all, therapy is always a benefit for anyone. 
Again, you can simply keep asking around and people will keep pointing you in the right direction. Then talk to that person. Then that person. And you’ll find your therapist. 

PS if you have insurance but are unsure if any person you would see is covered, also mention that. If you’re unsure what insurance you have, also say that, and ask how to find out. These people know the whole system really well, and will point you in the right direction until you have your answer."

As a suicide social worker I talked to say — things aren’t as inflated as you might think since -everyone- is forced inside. Big changes that individuals take on can be lonely, but big changes that everyone shares aren’t necessarily as lonely. Loneliness is a necessary factor for suicidality.

SuicideWatch,fm2j44n,t1_fm1e34q,1585698516.0,"Aw, that is unfortunate to hear! 

Well, 10 days is a long time for a few messages and is especially made more painful by the presence on social media. Which makes it seem like ghosting, which is never pleasant, but it still doesn’t discount the need for compassion here. It’s certainly frustrating to not get back results when it seems, from the contrast of her activity, like you’re being specifically chosen as someone to not respond to. I don’t know the dynamics of your relationship or its history and no one really does but you two. But anything without closure, without being given a direction with any certainty, is quite an awful experience. Hopefully she might see that.

One thing that will guarantee poorer short-term and long-term health for everyone is letting the frustration arise to a point where you become angry with her. I’ve basically been there myself, and yeah...it not only stops any chance of the relationship, but it forever ties all your memories with that person with hate and unpleasantness. Which makes becoming vulnerable again to another relationship hard. This is the risk/reward of becoming vulnerable and having a deep relationship. The most intense love, but also more intense heartbreak and other negative emotions if things don’t work out, or worse, you feel betrayed. 

At some point, if she seems to be giving you zero feedback and you’re becoming unwell because of it, that might indicate that a relationship with this amount of invisibility is not one for you. If she does come out of this and you get back together, definitely clarify for any next time this happens how you would know if she is ghosting you or if she can’t respond. Any kind of signal would put your mind at ease. 

How would you feel if you backed out right now? Would it put you at ease in some way or would you really rather endure the chance for further pain? For a ultramarathon runner who’s 60 miles deep into the 100 mile race but has broken feet: how confident are you that you’ll meet the finish line, or should you avoid further injury? Some people do continue and ignore their broken feet — I had a roommate who did this, as he was confident he could still finish the marathon. For here, the analogy would be how confident that her next response will indicate that you’re still in a relationship. Only you could tell from what you know about the relationship and its history at this point. It might be worth considering any parallels between now and January if a break-up seems logical by her view.

Certainly take care of yourself. You’ve done all the right things through this. Worst comes to worst, she’ll not know all the love and effort you put in. But you will. And it was the right thing to do for any partner. 

And to further clarify: I’m neither proposing to break-up or stay in. Only to reflect and consider how much you can handle, how deep the relationship truly is, and whether she would truly be counting on you to stick through this. It’s a lot to consider, so I can’t really say what I’d really do. Cherish the positive memories as much as you can throughout all of it. The more you consider this as something that makes you a better partner and person (which it has, so long as you don’t resolve to full anger) no matter how long you stick in it, the better off you’ll be for life."

SuicideWatch,flv7fep,t1_flul7wj,1585517956.0,"What I've learned from being heavily suicidal and regularly going to a psychiatric institute for depression to being generally okay everyday is that it is surprising how fundamental feelings are to all your thoughts.

Consider what happens with exercising, watching intense activities, or doing anything that gives you any feeling of a rush afterward. Do you choose this rush? And if it makes you feel better, it's not that you were deluded for a bit of time, it's that you were simply not feeling your depressive baseline in that time.

The thought that life is okay is synonymous with its feeling, which is generally called happiness. As soon as you have thoughts that are otherwise, you're not quite feeling that anymore. 

With depression, you wake up every morning with a baseline that is much lower than other people. If you can even think of a time you were once happy, whether it be years ago or earlier this day for a second. that's evidence that it's possible. When you recover from depression, this feeling sticks around for much of the day. You can think about nihilism and life's hardest questions in the same way, and you can still find them true, yet you can still feel life is okay. 

In other words, think of green being fundamentally made up of blue and yellow wavelengths. Green = blue + yellow. Let's say that with depression or with any suicidality you're generally 'blue', and that's it. 

Yet, it is absolutely possible to feel 'green' all day and still acknowledge the reality of 'blue' and 'yellow' in its makeup. You truly can experience a mix and yet still find it worth it to live, because that's what the feeling of 'yellow' is. In achieving green, you won't have to deny blue or yellow at all. You can still fully acknowledge the underlying realities of life. 

I'm hoping the best for you, and you're absolutely not alone in this! Thank you for speaking out, as it resonates with so many people!"
SuicideWatch,flt1l5u,t3_fqtx8q,1585456553.0,"It might just be me, but to this day, if I discover some new famous person whose work I like, whose life and personality I am inspired by, I find myself itching to Google their age, to check their Wikipedia entry for their biography. I think I am only fascinated, that I am just curious to figure out what the ingredients are for a life like that.

Unintentionally, I compare their life to mine -- to see if they went to college and graduated from a great school, how old they are and how old I am. And I never have much to share with them. My biographical details feel inferior, and their details feel like a necessary ingredient to me. I become defeated, even if I don't notice. I am suddenly destined for a life more inferior, and dwell on how it could have been different, how I could have a greater, easier life. As if following my ambitions was easier than what I have now. As if other people, as teens and young adults and adults, are somehow living as pure and innocent and carefree as when they were a child. As when I was a child. When things felt great, vibrant, without pain.

I tell myself it's not like that, that I don't do that comparing. But I don't believe myself. I definitely do that comparing, as I wouldn't have a blueprint to be disappointed by without the imagination I get from gleaning the trajectory of people's lives. It's the source of my anguish, that wanting, and has more to do with me wanting reassurance and thinking there is only one way to get it. Whenever I spell it out like that, of course it sounds ridiculous -- there is not just one way. In fact, any other way that is not my way is the disappointing way. Yet I get caught up in the memories of my earlier self, the imaginations of other people's lives, and think I need those exact experiences to relieve myself of my present pain. I just want a good life and to find some more easier moments than I do now.

I never chose my parents or my genes or the place I grew up in. Yet, everything flows from those beginnings. Everything I have, my mind and my future, has always been up to those beginnings. Things couldn't have been any other way. Things can't be any other way in the future, either.

Yet, for anyone who posts here, they are looking for hope. Hope for themselves, even if it's just a small feeling. A distraction from loneliness for one second. A brief period of relief from sharing what's concentrated in your mind. If that weren't the case, if no one hoped for better feelings, no one would even post here at all.

You're right, I don't think the hoping ends. In you posting here, you might also have been looking for hope. Who knows when you might have hoped, and if you got what you hoped for as soon as you posted your thoughts here. But in posting here at all, I imagine it was there. You care for yourself enough to share your thoughts. You're trying your best. Like me, you might have even been offering up the raw details of your life to us so that, maybe, just maybe, we could compare our thoughts and you would find something dissenting and convincing to change your core experience right now. In a way, I hope that is the case, because I want the best for you. We're all in this together here, and we all do for each other. Else we would not post here at all.

You really hit home with a lot of people. It's courageous of you to be so vulnerable to post how you really feel, and to wonder what it would be like if your hoping never ended. If your hoping never ended, I do not think you would be deluded.

You hoped to post here, to say how you really felt, and you did. That was as real as anything else. Even your loneliness or pain, those are real. Comparing now to the past is also a real experience in your body, and so is disappointment. But I think to myself, if I were to try and love anyone someday, I would have to simultaneously realize that they could be gone someday. I am not sure I could love them the same way if I believed, ""well, if they die, I'll just find another person."" Giving myself up to them, even giving myself up to the unknowns of life, requires I accept that there is going to be disappointment.

All I am interested in is having more of my hopes fulfilled than my disappointments realized, because I know both are coming. If I keep trying though, it could happen. For some people, as you said, it does happen. I do not know if there is any other option than to hope. And that's really okay. At the very least, there's less pain during it than during disappointment. That's worth something, and is something I think we all seek.

Your courage is really fulfilling to see."

Again, your thoughts are really clear-headed with everything you're doing. And you've already come a long way from when you first reached out here. It's really great to see you powering through this difficult experience with such bravery and vitality."
SuicideWatch,flsdfqa,t1_flrxo5p,1585439667.0,"That's excellent that the video was relevant for you! I'm really glad you could find goodness from it.

And yes, ultimately, I can't truly offer any prescriptive advice into how much you ought to communicate with her. I can only listen to what you say and hold up a little hand mirror from the text you've given me, reflecting back some of what you've said yourself to give better clarity on how to proceed. After all, it's what the aim of this sub is -- to offer an ear and a hand while also helping people help themselves. It's perhaps the best way to heal.

From my observation, you're responding in a good way, and I couldn't say how best to proceed from here. Without feedback from her, it's increasingly difficult to know how to respond. 

I think it's really beautiful, courageous, and a wonderful virtue that you've chosen to live 100% with her. It does cause more heartbreak, but it also allows for the deepest, most loving, and most successful relationships. As an author on depression (Andrew Solomon) has once wrote, ""There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss."" After all, it wouldn't be much of precious relationship if you thought, ""well, if anything happens to her, I could simply find another person."" It's true that everyone can find other relationships and find meaning in them, else no one would try. But choosing the particular value of a particular individual and all their uniquenesses despite everyone else is what makes love the way it is. So you might even be reassured, in a way, by the very fact that you're affected by her so deeply. It demonstrates you're very loving, and that no matter what happens, you're an individual capable of such vulnerability and love in this life. That is also precious.  
(And of course, let's cross our fingers and have hope and optimism, as if you can't control how she's acting, you may as well try to find as much peace as you can yourself.)

Again on the note of the very first exchange we had, whenever you feel that you really ought to respond, it's okay to follow that. I might also consider this. Try to feel out when you would be responding for your own sake -- to allay your own anxiety, to find peace in yourself -- and when you would be responding for her sake. If you found peace, if you had no anxiety, would you respond the way you would? When would you respond if you were at peace? And what would you say then? I think this is most likely to give you the answer you feel best with, and the answer that will also be the best for her. Because, by default, the more your intentions are fully about her, the better your impact on this situation will be. In a relationship, this is more often reciprocal, but since she's in a vulnerable state, getting to her level requires a similar vulnerability. You're already doing that simply by being worried and thinking of her. But checking your thoughts and actions for this background intention that we all have while experiencing difficult emotions might bring further clarity about what you should do in each moment."
SuicideWatch,flr8mid,t1_flpz05n,1585415210.0,"Yeah, even in silence, it sounds like you are having a proper conversation with her. You're listening to her silence and responding to it, not pressing on with words as usual as if you had ignored someone's words in a conversation. Those conversations are the best ones, and they make for the best relationships. When both parties listen and respond to each other.

Clearly, she's in a lot of turmoil, so she can't meet you at that level. That you're instead trying to meet her at hers is very noble and helpful for everyone. Your efforts aren't in vain -- though the ""read"" status on messenger platforms combined with the lack of response will always devalue the feeling of outreach. There's no feedback into how your message impacted the person. Confirming that their eyes glanced over it is a crude measurement, because it says nothing about how it affected the rest of the person. And certainly, their eyes aren't the ones experiencing your messages.

For her recovery -- with potent suicidality, as in needing to be watched and being in the emergency room, it's hard to feel the same for maybe a week or two. It's unusual for someone to be kept longer. If or when the suicidality comes back is basically random, but it is likely to come back unless there is something dramatic and steady in her treatment. Some medicine that really worked, or some major moment in therapy, or some major meaningful moment in her life. But that's rare and unusual. What is far easier to count on is that over time, they can become less frequent, are lower in duration, and are less severe. So long as treatment is sought and support is maintained. But there are no guarantees in life.

With cycles of depression, usually there is one week in every month that is at least a bit better than the other three.

On a grander timeline, years, I'm imagining more or less a landscape of sand dunes. There are peaks and valleys in traversing the whole experience, and it's not always clear when sand dunes stop being sand dunes. But over time, they lessen in height, and they just become small folds of sand that might only be as tall as a small staircase. They still take some leg muscle to get over, but you don't have to give it the same attention you would need in traversing a dune the size of a small mountain. In my own depression, that seems to be how it is -- that things lessen in duration, frequency, and severity over time, even if the cycles never technically go away. They can certainly become manageable, however, and it's not to be underestimated.

It's tough for her, but you can get through this too. It's really hard now, and that's normal.

One of the best things you can do for yourself now is to keep yourself expressing love to other areas where you do get feedback. Since her responding to you is out of your control, the more attention you give it, the more difficult it is going to feel. I know that spending attention other things is far, far harder in reality than in practice. But the more you try getting your attention zoomed in on something else that is absorbing that you know yourself to like, the less of a toll this situation will take on you. With books, or games (though I personally don't game, as it became an addiction for me and felt unhealthy, but if you can control that, all the power to you), or with any other activity, it will help. I'm certainly thinking of 'activities' or other people here. Different flavors of love and friendship and social fulfillment. You have other relationships to explore, even if they're metaphorical.

Consider this video, it might help. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ss1HuA1hIk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ss1HuA1hIk). I happened to watch it within the last 24 hours and it might be relevant to you in the whole theme of trying but only being half of the story. And in having conversations/relationships that are fulfilling.

Lastly, I think anxiety has a lot to do with thinking about the future and your body giving you the adrenaline to act immediately -- but being unable to do anything at all. Because the thing you are thinking about happens in the future, your stress just sticks around, ready, as you wait for the event in your mind to arrive. The more you can use your energy on anything, the less stressful you'll feel, the less of a toil you'll experience, and the easier it will be to actually find yourself at your goal: the future.

That your next step largely has to do with waiting, that's evidence to me that you've put in enough effort. As I mentioned, you can't control the result, and all you can do is wait. I think this all means that it's okay to have your attention spent on other things too. You can have that peace of mind.

(Now that I've written this response, I realize it is a long message, and so don't feel you have to respond to anything about it. I always write with the anticipation that my messages could be and likely are the last response (from me, not from you!), since that gives me the ability to keep responding to everyone. But that doesn't mean I don't keep conversing and responding -- I'm always happy to keep conversing. I'm truly happy to. My sole purpose in mentioning this here is so that my own response, in its length, doesn't have that weight of importance that makes it difficult to respond to. There is no social expectation by me that you have to respond to anything in any amount of time. Hours, days, weeks, or never, it's all the same.

(I apologize if I’m about to sound like part of a broken record as you’ve probably heard it already, but if you haven’t tried already, I might try calling those desperate grocery stores back to see what’s up. Sounds weird for them! And honestly, that’s how a lot of places decide which workers they hire — they see who makes the follow-up calls. (Again, just mentioning it in case you haven’t already heard it, as it can be an underestimated and effective step in finding employment.))

SuicideWatch,flpk544,t3_fq135o,1585361406.0,"Personally, in growing up, I keep seeing the same argument appear no matter how old I get. “You peak in your teens,” then “you certainly peak in your 20s,” and I even see from other peers who are older than me, “yeah in your 30s and 40s, you peak. Middle age is the peak, for sure.” 

“Peak” is totally contextual, but the most important peaking, the only one that can ever matter, is peaking in your emotional quality of life and happiness. That doesn’t have an age, and the peak never stops growing. In that sense, it’s not a peak at all, but an upward slope.

Not only is that subreddit naiive and hurtful in claiming women peak in their teens (and I imagine they’re referring to some medieval, unscientific notion of fertility and beauty), they’re just not correct. They‘re equating ‘peak’ with the images that make them peak in their pants. Very naiive.

Additionally, the concept of a peak doesn’t help, because it suggests it’s only downhill once you pass it. Again, in peaking on “how you feel,” there is no peak, only slopes. There is no ceiling for happiness, for how you feel. By posting here, you are seeking an education for yourself to help out your emotional quality of life. You’re trying very hard to help yourself. That’s all you can do. And it’s one of the best predictors for feeling better in the long-run.

In being motivated enough to reach out to a place like here, instead of succumbing to silence, you are being courageous. You are already someone who is treading upward on a slope. It might feel hard now, but with time, you’ll be higher up in your happiness because of it.

This is a very painful experience for you, and it saddens me that you have to go through it. But you are doing the right thing for yourself by trying to problem solve it and find answers."
SuicideWatch,flphrxj,t1_flpgef8,1585359787.0,"Oops, sent before I meant to. But anyway,

Regardless, it’s not an easy situation, and it would be tough for me too. If you’re worried, that’s okay. If you’re feeling a gentle push, then that’s useful to consider, even though social media formatting gives you so little information for your brain compared to in-person contact. It doesn’t mean it’s the end though — certainly avoid jumping to extremes as much as you can during this tough time. It only means what it seems like for now — a gentle push, if that’s really what it ends up being. She might just need some breathing room for now. It’s promising to me though that she’s interacting with people. Especially if it’s in a normal or positive way, that’s a good sign.

In college I was friends with two people who were partners since high school, and there were a few schisms that I thought was ending their relationship. In reflection, they simply said that the week or two of less contact and more self-reflection was only helpful to their relationship.

Nonetheless, I do hope for both your sakes that she does respond to you in some way eventually, as clarity is always healing. Whether it’s the pressure of importance in your relationship weighing down on her, or her sending some gentle message that neither of us could possibly decipher because we can’t read her mind, hopefully you get some more insight into the situation soon. 

It’s great you followed up the way you did though. I don’t think you could have done better any other way. As I said before, you’re doing the best you can.

I once called the suicide hotline for myself some time ago, and the person there once told me something that I keep written on a sticky note above my desk to this day. In reference to trying my best with all of my actions, he asked me, “Are you letting go of the result?” And it’s true. There’s nothing you can do to influence directly what she will say or choose to respond to or do. You can only do your actions, but once you’ve done them, the subsequent results that follow are totally at the whim of the universe and its uncertainty. 
You caring and trying and responding is enough, and whatever you do next is also all you can ever do. You can try your best, but then only hope for the best from it. It’s great that you’re continuing on this and that you care so much. You’re investing in your emotional quality of life and in a good way no matter what happens. I hope things turn around for her too."
SuicideWatch,flpgef8,t1_flp1ykk,1585358869.0,"Hmm, instinctively, a couple things.

Partnerships are still friendships, and individual partners will (hopefully) always have other friends too. It’s healthy that way. Some people call friendships “emotionships”, because each friendship is unique and addresses a different part of their emotional quality of life. Maybe one friend has a clinical assessment of life and offers narrow but useful value that way, and another friend is very carefree and helps you see the comedy in things when stuff seems exceptionally serious. A partnership is more likely to bring a broad range of value to many different emotional needs and facets of life, but no partnership could possibly be godlike and be so perfect that other people wouldn’t bring value.

So it could be easier for her to talk to other people for whatever individual value they are offering her — and it doesn’t mean anything poorly about you. I’m really comfortable being more serious than I am being comical, and so I would certainly hope a future partner of mine to have friends they can also laugh with if they want even more laughter in their life. It’ll certainly be important that we laugh together, but certain friends can just be really funny. I’m not that. No offense taken.

So, transitioning to the second thing, people generally procrastinate/avoid/get weighed down by things the more important they are, as the stakes are higher to “get it right.” For her other friendships and social media, they don’t necessarily know anything about what she’s going through, and it could be a lot easier for her to respond to those friends. They offer their own unique values, which could be particularly helpful for her, as it can help her to explore other avenues for her to escape her current pain. Seems like a natural thing to do to me."
SuicideWatch,flp0wt8,t3_fq5mkr,1585349443.0,"The recipe for feeling suicidal is: numbness to pain and death (it comes with depression over a long period of time), feeling like a burden (also comes after awhile), and alienation (which is especially easy right now). If you lose any one of those, you'll immediately feel better. Typically, the one that's easiest to change is feeling alienated, and so your concerns about suicide and feeling lonely are absolutely validated here. 

Luckily, no matter how hard you try, it's hard to stay isolated and feel lonely for long. There are 8 billion people on this small earth walking around, and you're going to bump into someone soon. At some point, your last friend just appeared out of the blue, right? One day you did not know they even existed. The next day, you knew of them. This will happen again.

So what are you supposed to do that's not suicide? On one hand, simply survive. The longer you give yourself to discover someone new, the more days you encounter where you'll know about new people.

It's always really random how friendships happen. It's hard to seek them out, or at least it always has been for me. But I know that COVID-19 makes this especially hard right now! I can't say I know of anything else than to say -- keep bumping into people. Offline and online. Eventually, you'll find someone that shares your interests.

Consider my username, doorwayinthesand. It's a reference to a 1970s book 'Doorways in the Sand' by a niche scifi author. I've always told myself that if I ever found people who really liked this author's work, then I'd get along great with them, because it'd be so unusual and yet so personal. You might consider exploring places where people are talking about something you really enjoy. That will make it easier.

But right now, you're dealing with a lot. You can do this. You're super self-aware. As you say, you 'swear you were being good.' It sounds so much like you really want the best for yourself. I think you'll find it so long as you keep sticking around. You're making good progress, even if it doesn't feel like it now. 

It's a shame to me that your friends didn't consider how people can learn and change. That really saddens me and I'm sorry you have to go through that. It has to be really painful. I've been there too. With time, I made and lost friends myself, and eventually found that even if I was sounding negative, the friends who ended up staying my friends and meaning the most to me were the ones who didn't run away. They always gave me a chance.

Until you can bump into people easier once this COVID-19 stuff settles down, I am hoping the best for you. It sounds cliche, but I am hoping that you can be your own friend. I am hoping you can give yourself a chance."
SuicideWatch,floy8ha,t3_fpvn7z,1585347911.0,"At least to me, you don't come off as someone who seems entitled to a relationship. You come off as being really reflective of what you want for yourself and your life, which is great thing to have."
SuicideWatch,flovu6p,t3_fq3otx,1585346528.0,"You know how sometimes on really good YouTube videos that have thousands of likes and is hard to imagine how anyone would dislike it? Yet somehow there are 100 dislikes? 

Sometimes people simply accidentally click dislike. True, there are bots and trolls out there who simply downvote to downvote (and they don't think of you when they do it, so it doesn't say anything about you or your post!) But this does happen from time to time. I've done it for things I've loved and didn't notice I hit my keyboard/mouse wrong until later! So, at the very least, this could be a contributor to random dislikes you might receive anywhere.

That, and Reddit has an algorithm that doesn't always show your true upvotes and downvotes. It's a way to confuse bots. So you might not have even received as many, or perhaps any, 'real' downvotes!

To quote from [https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/21id6d/why\_do\_number\_of\_downvotes\_on\_my\_posts\_fluctuate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/21id6d/why_do_number_of_downvotes_on_my_posts_fluctuate/) and the user PanicOnFunkotron, 

""\[Random up and downvotes\] are a way to confuse spam robots. If someone is shadowbanned (they can  still post, but no-one can see their posts), they might realize what's  happening when none of their posts get voted on and make a new account.  With the vote-fuzzing, it looks like people are viewing your post and  voting on it, even though that might not actually be happening.""

Together, these mean that no matter what, you are likely receiving less real downvotes than you think you are. That doesn't make it feel any better, but it can help to lessen the impact of feeling that there was a person behind each of those votes. 

The people who comment are the people who matter most. And you are courageous to speak out, even in this post. We want the best for you. :)"
SuicideWatch,flohttq,t3_fq37yl,1585338586.0,"This absolutely does sound difficult for you both. And it sounds like you both have feelings you're wrestling with, feelings that both of you want to address. Yet in a single conversation with two people's feelings to address, it can already be hard enough to find the bandwidth to address one person's. The only people who practice this skill on earth call themselves therapists, and I only to say that there are very few people on earth who are skilled at doing what you both are trying to do. With that in mind, there really is no shame to be had if you are finding yourselves unsuccessful. We all try our best. You guys certainly are, or else you wouldn't keep calling each other. That's definitely trying.

You couldn't have controlled not noticing your ringer and missing those calls and messages. You can't control what you don't notice! When you're already trying your hardest, of course you're going to miss minor things like this, let alone know if they'll even be important. If you're feeling numb from this, there is no shame here, you truly could not have done anything differently. There is no way to go back in time to notice what you did not notice. And everyone needs sleep -- something you absolutely can't change.

If you haven't already, I might send her a message being honest, that you didn't notice you had your ringer shut off and that you really want to speak with her. That you hope she's well and that whatever you're doing, however it's making her feel, you're doing it's because you love her and want the best for her. Or else you wouldn't keep trying, and you wouldn't be reaching out to suicidewatch for advice. You're giving this your best shot. Whatever happens, it sounds like both of you are trying very hard, but neither of you can't control the result. You can only say something, do something, and hope it makes the other person feels better. Your own emotional quality of life is not something to be punished for that, to go numb over -- you are doing all you can, and that is always enough, because there is nothing more to give than your best.

If you really, really, believe she might be harming herself, then yes, it's okay to call 9-1-1. While those experiences can be traumatic if they're wrong, they can be life-saving if they're right. I think the best option here would be to text her, and see if you know any friends who would know her number or one of her parents' numbers. If you think you might save a life by calling the police, though, then it's okay to do that. If she was thinking about suicide that's one thing and is a common experience, but if she was really entertaining it and planning it out and about to say goodbye, then that's another thing.

If she is only struggling with the first option, then texting and calling and waiting are all you can do. In that scenario, continuing to listen to what she wants and feels is best for herself is your best option. Nonetheless, letting her know that you love her and want the best for her is always helpful to say to anyone."
SuicideWatch,flmdnx3,t3_fpp4yg,1585280814.0,"One approach would be being even more honest about your communication behaviors -- it might help to allay her possibly thinking that you are no longer reaching out as much because you've fallen a little out of love. It could be helpful to address that before she takes it that way, as persons with depression and anxiety are prone to 'finding evidence' for feeling like they are being a burden. You might mention that you really do want to reach out, but you've been consciously restraining yourself from messaging her because you care about her and haven't been sure if reaching out too much would overwhelm her. You do still love her and are really hoping the best for her feeling better.

It's certainly good she's around people that care about her, since alienation spurs along suicidality. Desensitization to pain and death (typically comes through depression and life experiences over a long time)  +  feeling like a burden (life experience)  +  feeling alienated are three major factors for suicidality. Recovery from suicidality generally works best from the last factor backward -- making them feel less alienated helps them to feel less like a burden which can help to remiss their depressive symptoms temporarily. 

I think you just sending along messages, reassuring messages of love and support, really does help. A question you might ask yourself: Which would be worse? Getting messages about someone loving you and having some anxiety over it, or getting no positive messages at all? Only you can know this specific circumstance, but it's more often that being exposed to love and support are inherently doing more good than harm.

It's more likely akin to being an introverted person who never goes out to events that they're invited to. What feels worse -- getting repeated invitations from friends, but denying them, or never having friends reach out to you at all? If the friends are people you don't want to associate with, then it could be annoying, but if they're at least neutral to you, then it can be reaffirming that someone actually thinks of you -- and values you. You might even argue that the annoying friend scenario could still be reaffirming of your worth at some level. Knowing that anyone at all is thinking about you in a positive, 'I want to connect' way helps to combat feelings alienation.

No one wants to be alone, and being more transparent that you're thinking about her might help. Even if she's reading but not responding -- I've been there plenty of times with deep depression, and it certainly is not something I will make light of -- I think your messages, if they are expressing any kind of love and value toward her, are likely providing a better outcome than if you did not message at all.

If she says she is being watched, it certainly is a tough and serious time for her. But it's great that you are reaching out here to educate yourself on what you could do. You can't control her behavior or the direct results of anything you do. But it seems you are really giving it your best shot. For yourself, that's all you can ask for, and it's something to acknowledge even if you find yourself as her partner 20 years from now. It means a lot not only to the people who suffer from this, but I hope you find meaning in knowing you are always trying your hardest too."
SuicideWatch,flmat83,t3_fpp2qc,1585278720.0,"Right! So much of experience is a lottery. And people who say cliche things like 'there is someone for everyone' tend to have won the lottery, and so don't know what you're talking about. It's like a rich person saying how awful it must be to be poor and be spending $10 for a banana -- they try to understand, but they're not exactly in touch enough to fully understand.

But I do know that if everything you were given at birth is a lottery -- your genes, your parents and their parenting, the conditions you grew up in -- then so it is for other things every day. You might win lotteries in your education, your career. That's what I try to think anyway, and it's helped me cope. 

After all, if each day has its own lotteries, then the longer I stick around, the more likely I'm finally going to catch a break at some point. Some people just win multiple of them right in the beginning with their genes and circumstances. The error society seems to make is to celebrate, even fetishize that. It's super ignorant! 

Fingers crossed for your own luck. It's the best we can do. Luckily, it seems to work out for a lot of people."
SuicideWatch,flm9584,t3_fpntgq,1585277542.0,"First of all, thank you for your courage to speak out here. Even if you feel it is out of desperation, it's really great to see that you're actively trying to learn more about what this thing is and that you're doing your best to find out more. It seems to me you really want to improve the quality of your life. That's reassuring to see.

As someone who has dealt with OCD for many years, I do know that OCD can pop up in many different ways and that everyone is different. However, it seems to me that your experience has a different element to it that OCD doesn't typically have. (Not to say you don't have unwanted thoughts or OCD! For me, OCD is like passing a road and always imagining myself accidentally tripping over a rock and getting hit by traffic -- thoughts that are like 'nightmares' and 'daydreaming' combined. Spontaneous 'daymares' that last a few seconds or a couple minutes, and can cause my adrenaline/stress to spike for a little bit.) This 'third-person' state you describe seems more in the lines of losing identity with your body, and perhaps your thoughts.

This state in itself doesn't necessary mean anything bad, as -- like with unwanted thoughts -- everyone can experience it from time to time, but the main thing is how often and how strong. I'm a bit surprised your psychiatrist couldn't understand you, as I think most people have these types of experiences from time to time. But from how you're talking about it, it seems that these occur enough for you to make your life really painful, and no matter how strong or frequent they really are, that's all that matters. I'm sad that your experience is that way, but I am also glad you're not suffering alone, and that you are reaching out to try and get better.

If there is any condition to be concerned about at all, what you are describing seems more in line with something like a depersonalization or dissociative condition. Here is an example. [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depersonalization-derealization-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352911](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depersonalization-derealization-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20352911). However, again, I only put that in response to the experience you're describing. It is simply closer to the experience you've described than to OCD. Knowledge is power, but please be careful with self-diagnosing. When I searched for that link, the images online made me feel uncomfortable, and I quite frankly found them to be a bit stigmatic. All those dark images that pop up are not prescriptions to how you should feel about what you're experiencing!

Perhaps bring that up to your psychiatrist, and if they don't have experience with the experiences you are describe, you might consider finding a psychiatrist, therapist, or social worker who does have that experience (if you have that option). If not though, please don't lose hope, and also don't take my opinion here about your experience as fact. Again, with what you've described in a few paragraphs, it just simply sounds more like what you're describing.

That you are reaching out to suicidewatch really does legitimize your pain! It has been painful enough to bring you here. I used to work at a rehab clinic where patients of all conditions were there. The single-most important factor for people getting better and feeling happier was how motivated they were to seek out their own improvement. You're already doing that. You're already more likely than the average person to be rescued from the pain you're describing. So I can't say it enough, that you are trying to seek out more information is something to celebrate. If you're not, I am for you."
SuicideWatch,fllzfy9,t3_fpn4ta,1585271068.0,"I hear you, and it is definitely one of the worst feelings there are to feel. It will help to talk it out, you're absolutely right about that. You're not acting like a baby, you're being a mature person who is doing their best to figure out how to confront their feelings :)

Being vulnerable with a small number of people, even just one person, has its rewards and risks. It allows deep friendships to grow tighter than others, but it also leaves more room for pain if one of the people involved in the relationship does something hurtful. As an introverted person, I prefer it this way, and I like to move slowly between the few relationships I've had, because I like having those minimal but deep connections. However, one of my best friends once totally turned on me when I revealed I was thinking about suicide, and it was crushing.

But soon enough I came to realize that this was for the better, and that it wasn't about me, it was about him not being able to cope with his fear of what I might do in the future. He couldn't manage his emotions in the face of a real dilemma I was having. He wasn't willing to be there for me when I really needed help, and just cut ties quite severely, and it hurt a lot. Any of these kind of experiences are traumatic. 

In time, I acquired another friendship where I am surprised how much they are there for me no matter what I've talked about. They can happen, and I firmly think that if you simply survive and keep seeking to improve yourself as you are doing by posting here, these relationships will come your way.

I might also say that everyone has value. This person saw your value and you saw theirs. If it really is over, as you say, were there any moments of your friendship that helped you through some part of your life? When any relationship ends traumatically, I've found it really helpful to reflect on it as if I were reflecting on the death of a loved one. The person is pretty much gone for good in my life, but how will the experiences I had with them help me get through life better? I try to imagine what life would be like without having had the relationship at all, and then realize that my life was better while I had it -- even though it did not end well. 

Seriously -- I know it might not seem this way, but it's not about you as much as it might seem. There is always another person involved who is scared or is not confronting their feelings well. And there are 8 billion other people on earth. With time, you are bound to make another friend and have better experiences! It's one of life's few guarantees."
