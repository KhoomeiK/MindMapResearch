CasualUK,fgsd129,t3_f07vte,1581080861.0,"Kudos for traveling there in off season. Great deals, smaller crowds, but some of the main attractions closed if i recall. That's the way to go. Plus sometimes you meet locals in more authentic ways, going about their daily lives rather than catering to tourists all day and getting grumpy."

Life,fbbqhfi,t3_echrwp,1576705889.0,"Good on you being clear about yourself. So many people look outside for problems, and for solutions. 

You're getting there. Cut back on self-sabotage (the pretending about college degree; no one in web dev cares). Take small steps like eat better every Thursday and go to the gym every Monday. Keep learning and staying honest with yourself. Keep keeping on. You got this."

learnprogramming,f1t5rb8,t3_dajin3,1569739191.0,"Approach with curiosity. I'm in my 50's and I'm literally learning new things every week. Pick one place to start, like getting a django website up and running to track your favorite songs. That's a few weeks, then see if you can add a connection to Spotify, then decide to translate it all into Spanish, then make sure it's 508 compliant, then dabble in React......

Don't worry about a year from now, just start anywhere and keep at it. There's literally so much that half the first half of becoming a programmer is just figuring what you like, backend, databases, front end, analysis.... And don't worry about not knowing. Every single day I don't know stuff. It's actually fun figuring things out. 

You can totally do this. Be curious, have as much fun as you can, learn continuously and after some time you'll realize you're good at certain things, and you really like certain things, and it keeps expanding from there."

news,exfhn6t,t3_csiwe2,1566240751.0,"I grew up in NoHo in the 70's and 80's and spent a lot of time downtown. What i remember about that time is that there were a lot of SRO (""single resident occupancy""?) hotels. Shared bathroom, people had hot plates, and they were cheap. These used to be everywhere near bus stations, downtown. That housed a lot of ""transient"" people with low income.

Step one, get people into some form of inexpensive housing. If the city would build basic SRO apartments scattered about the city near social security and social service offices, it would be far cheaper than having to support people on the streets shitting and dropping needles."
