Ying is balanced, nerfing her is dumb as hell. Just tweaking the 500 damage on illusion shattering to make it viable would be perfect 
Seris shadow travel should have 8 seconds on cooldown with the card that decreases it's cooldown when healing should be tweaked to have the same function but decreased numbers. And should have more speed on the base kit."
