Leaving food unattended is a fire safety hazard so if the lights were off and no one was in sight, that's an issue. 

Despite this, you did not have a right to throw out his property. Turning the fire off would have been enough or even waiting with the food until the person returned and then explaining the rules. Throw out the food in the pot if that is a rule? Sure, but the whole pot? 

He was definitely an asshole to you and should have not spoken down to you like that, but you also should realize that a person's property could be one of the few things they own. Especially in a college setting.

As someone who has also struggled with weight and a form of an eating disorder, you told her the truth. It will hurt now, but better now when she is able to start changing than in a hospital bed.

""I *knew* it!"" 

Squinting, I tilted my head to the side and raised a brow. ""That...spoons existed?"" I questioned, unsure of where he was going with this. 

""Noâ€”well, yes, but *no*, that vampires exist!"" 

My eye twitched at the volume of his voice but I simply apologized to the others around us and reached out for my friend's sleeve. I forced him back into his seat easily, noticing his eyes flickering back and forth between his sleeve and my expression. 

""You...""

""Me,"" I said easily, letting go of his sleeve once I knew he wouldn't run off and clasping my hands together in front of my face. ""And you, soon, if you don't quiet down. Humans aren't supposed to be around vampires if you haven't noticed already.""

I could tell that he was sweating a bit, though I wasn't sure if it was from the excitement of his discovery or delayed fear. When the dopey grin formed a moment later, I knew it was the former. 

""I can't believe it. Do you sparkle?""

""Am I attached to the ceiling in the 1980s?"" I retorted, before sighing and shaking my head. ""No, I don't *sparkle*."" 

""Sorry..."" he murmured, scooching closer and clearing his throat. His fingers drummed against the table as he parted his lips only to look away instead. He did this a few times, my patience not what it used to be as I slammed a hand against the table and gave him a smile through grit teeth. 

I adored him considering he was my best friend, but his skittish behavior at the moment was running me up the wall. 

""No garlic won't kill me, a stake to the heart would kill most people not just vampires, yes, silver hurts like a mother fucker.""

""â€”Crosses don't do shit, yes we feed on animals but not because we want to spare humans, but because what you eat makes you all rather unappetizing and animals won't end up on the news if they're gone.""

""*This* is worth your inheritance? How do I even know you're telling the truth?"" I demanded, eyeing him from head to toe and raising a brow. ""You don't look like no billionaire to me.""

The man tilts his head inquisitively. ""And just how do billionaires look, my dear?""

I lift my hands as they stuttered in a similar manner as my brain while I tried to find the words to explain. ""I dunno, just...rich! You know, walkin' around with a cane...talkin' in a funny accent. Always wearin the same thing like in the cartoons or in those movies.""

The longer I rambled, the bigger the smile on his lips became until I was red-faced and far too prideful to continue. He turned to the person standing beside him, the two wearing the same expression and making my blood boil.

""This ain't about me anyway. This is about you pretendin' to be some hotshot with a toy from the 99 cent store. No living person would just give money away. The world don't work like that.""

I hold it out to him, not wanting to play any more of these childish games. I was just here to clean a house and if there wasn't one around I was leaving before things got weird...*er.*

""Trust me, this is far more valuable than anything you could buy. It's an opportunity. One that you seem willing to let go of before you even begin, might I add.""

I pause, wondering what this guy was on and if it would be rude to ask for him to share. Not cracking even as I stared him down, I crossed my arms.""Alright, fine, I'll play. All I gotta do is give you back this stupid coin and I get money? Easy enough.""

He held up a finger but I was already walking away back to my car. ""Remember, everyone will know you have this coin, miâ€”""

""*Everyone will know you have this coin*,"" I repeated, tossing a final look over my shoulder with the best customer service smile I could muster. ""Yeah, yeah, like you know anyone that would want whatever you're smokin' anyway. Thanks for calling Claire's Cleaners and next time have a place for me to make some buck off.""

I got to my car and started it up, the two men waving at me as I snorted. I didn't take a closer look at the coin until I got to a red light, curiosity getting the better of me as I flipped it over. There seemed to be some initials and I thought it'd be fun to search them online later along with the term 'billionaire' and see just how many dollar store chains came up. With a roll of my eyes, I opened my glove compartment and tossed the coin in, chuckling to myself all the way home.

She was born out of America but came here when she was 18 with her mother and sisters. As citizens of 'merica, she was able to get insurance from her job and go to the hospital which they didn't have where she was from because she lived in a much less convenient area and not in the city. 

So basically she was swollen and everyone thought she was just chubby. In reality, she was anemic to the point of her blood looking similar to water. The doctors were able to help her, but told her had she come a year later, she most likely would have died. I don't know how the hell stuff like this happens, but she has pictures of her before and after the treatment and she shrunk down to a measly 110 pounds after treatment. 

Whenever she talks to me about it, she says she never thought at the time she was in danger, just in pain.

billieeilish,esla8jp,t3_aepait,1562082043.0,"When I first listened, I thought it was about a girl in love with someone unattainable, but the more I listened I came to the conclusion of quite the opposite. This might be a bit long and not right at all, but this is how I see it so I hope this is alright :) 

>Don't you know I'm no good for you  
>  
>I've learned to lose you, can't afford to  
>  
>tore my shirt to stop you bleeding  
>  
>but nothing ever stops you leaving 

This stanza first seemed like she is talking to the person after they've broken up. She recalls a time where she felt this person was better than her: someone so great that she couldn't afford to lose them but has long since prepared herself for that exact moment. However, when pairing it to the next couple of lines, we can see there is a bit of anger in the tone rather than sadness. This person is someone the singer loves, but the relationship had always had a distinct power balance from the get-go. She only noticed this after they broke up, and now wonders why she put up with nonsense for so long and why the person used her in such a way.

>Don't you know too much already?  
>  
>I'll only hurt you if you let me   
>  
>Call me friend, but keep me closer (Call Me Back)  
>  
>And I'll call you when the party's over 

Here, I feel as if the person in the song is trying to remind this person they love that they are kind of manipulative. They know so much about the singer to the point of knowing that they can't hurt him even if they wanted to. He hurts her so freely and yet she knows the only way she could do the same to him is if he ALLOWED her to: again, power dynamic. It's a sense of powerlessness along with anger at the fact that this person who never put effort into her is calling her only after she has learned to let go. The ""Call me back"" part reminds me of when people drink and have a moment of weakness, BUT I also feel like it could be the ex-lover's plead which leads to the singer's explosion of ""I'll call you when the party's over"". I feel like this is kinda supported by Billie's own explanation of the song about being angry that someone is calling during a party to the point of it being like ""fucking leave me alone"". 

>Quiet I'm not coming home and I'm on my own  
>  
>And I could lie say I like it like that, like it like that  
>  
>Yeah I could lie say I like it like that, like it like that 

Here is the concept of the singer understanding that she is alone now rather than having someone to go back to. While at first, I thought that the ""I could lie say I like it like that"" line was in reference to the ""I'm on my own"" part, I feel like it is only in reference to that when the singer first says it. It's a process to adjust to being alone when you were with someone you would have given the shirt off your back for. This person was her home, but she realized it was on fire and that it's better to be alone. Along with this realization, towards the end of this the second time around, the singer adds in:

>But nothing is better, sometimes  
>  
>Once we've both said our goodbyes   
>  
>Let's just let it go  
>  
>Let me let you go

An all or nothing situation. The singer knows the relationship was toxic for them both and has come to the conclusion that going back to it is impossible without lying to herself and the other person. She cannot give her all, so she doesn't want to give anything. Being alone is better than being with someone who only wants to be with you to control what you do and manipulate your feelings. She can no longer convince herself that this person is worthy. She is saying that the only way to deal with this is letting each other go but this other person doesn't agree (hence all the calling). Unlike the beginning of the song, she can afford to lose this person after thinking through everything and has prepared for them to part ways. 

>Quiet I'm not coming home and I'm on my own  
>  
>And I could lie say I like it like that, like it like that  
>  
>Yeah I could lie say I like it like that, like it like that 

The song ends with this person understanding that being alone is still not ideal, and that she could always go back and lie, but at what cost? The tone of how it is sung and how it fades out implies clarity at what the singer is trying to say, but could also be a reflection of how easy it is to fall back into old habits. The way the background music gets quieter and slows down also shows the winding down of the party and I pictured a walk or drive home: to a new home. A bit of emptiness and clarity but also sadness and hesitation."

&#x200B;

I could be reading too deep into this though, but I would definitely have a chat with the significant other about weight fluctuations. Just so she won't freak out and she can start learning that it's normal for weight to go up and down sometimes."

I'm glad that you're alright! I know how scary it could be for sure, as anxiety and stress can mess with the body in physical symptoms that can mimic what we're worried about. Sucks that the doctor wasn't taking you seriously, though. Seems to happen a lot from what I see online : /"
