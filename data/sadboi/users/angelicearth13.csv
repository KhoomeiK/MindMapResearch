ambien,fbddozd,t3_ecs3yy,1576758727.0,Well they workin alright. Typing is hard bc the letters r a little fuzzy and a lot that goes into typing is muscle memory and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve never typed before or something. i just barely know how. It was hard to get this sentence out
ambien,fbdcpvs,t1_fbdby74,1576757689.0,"Currently I‚Äôm listening to music wrapped in blankets in my bed. Every time i take ambien i always lay down immediately and then listen to some music and soon enough my starship (bed) disembarks.  My little cloud i float upon every nite has never failed me.  What I‚Äôm referring to is my bed basically. Whenever i take a high dose i just jump in bed and wait for the ambien to kick and once it does it feels like my bed starts levitating and floating very peaceful around  the room. I‚Äôve  also had some hallucinations that are auditory hallucinations  when i took ambien once and i could literally imagine like the craziest shit /scene ~if you will~ I‚Äôll see flashes of random scenes almost like seeing some else‚Äôs 
Memories. Or sometimes a group of people inside my head whisper thing s to me but they all cool. They only come up when i take ambien. 

What are weird things y‚Äôall do on ambien   I need ideas"

I was abused by him for my entire childhood until i was 18. I‚Äôm still close with my mom who divorced him when i was in 6th grade. I was raped in my own bed when i was in 2nd grade.

cats,f82tv7z,t1_f82t0mz,1574198110.0,"I believe either A: he ran away to die because not to long ago my father put down my other cat (Clemson) due to illness, he also refused to tell me that. Found out a week later. Didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye. And then jack ran away to die of a broken heart bc that can happen to animals. When their companion (whether it be person or another cat) dies, the animal is so stressed it stops their heart Or B: my evil stepmother put down jack because my dad and stepmom where annoyed with how much he was meowing after Clemson (our other cat) died :("

That‚Äôs when it started getting unbearable. It took 4 years of constantly telling my parents i was suicidal before they took me to the doctor. When i finally went, i was 17 years old and i went to a psychiatrist recommended to me by my therapist who then Diagnosed me and sent me to rehab for the first time. I was admitted to an in patient program at the hospital and i was stuck there for about a week."
