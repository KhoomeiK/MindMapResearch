depression,fkn0a04,t1_fklgunb,1584347511.0,"I don’t know the situation with your parents, but I would say just go straight to them and just say, “I’m really struggling with my grades and I’m having a hard time working through some things and I’d like to see a therapist.”

If they’re closed off to your feelings just open with the grades and leave out the depression. 

Also, if your first therapist doesn’t seem to be a good fit, find another. I’ve wasted a lot of time on shitty ones. Make sure you feel comfortable and able to discuss trauma and be transparent about your feelings. 

I’m sorry you feel so lost."

socialanxiety,fjzvy8p,t3_ffo9bf,1583731242.0,"Omg!!!!! I went through this exact thing when I was 19 and had just moved out of my mom’s. I ate nothing but a pack of Oreos for weeks. 

I’m 32 now, and I’m still a part of this group, so obviously I’m not totally over it. But I will say, my “5 strangers” have become life long friends.

My advice to break the ice is to put on your fav music and clean the kitchen or organize a common space when you know someone may be coming home. 

It’s something positive to contribute to the household, it forces you to be outside your comfort zone (but you can also retreat if it becomes overwhelming) and gives you a task to focus on. 
And also, when in doubt or feeling awkward it’s ok to just lean into it. 
“Hey, sorry I’ve been so awkward haha. My social anxiety is terrrrrible. I’m trying to work on it!” 

Most people, especially at your age, are operating with varying levels of social anxiety. Everyone is just trying to find their place in the world. Opening up about it is usually really well received. Most likely the response will be, “Omg me too. It’s a nightmare! Haha”

Hang in there!"
