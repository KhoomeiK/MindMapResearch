Maine,fpu0urq,t1_fptu80u,1588902274.0,"Yeah, seriously,  The ones who are demanding to be seen by their hairdressers ASAP, are probably the most risky to be in close contact with.  I'm terrified for hairdressers, especially in Southern Maine...  The opening of hair salons has totally put me off Mills, but would never vote LePage or something worse."

And, yes, it is a strange taper!  My doctor had suggested that I taper down from 10mg to nothing in two weeks, but I've been splitting and re-splitting pills, and extending the time between doses as much as possible.  I had a hellish time for 3 months when I started the drug, even at really low doses."

(My spouse is also a software developer and he went through something similar.  He was with one company for 10ish years, and played an integral role in development but never got good marks on ""leadership.""  I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that he started as a more junior developer and also the culture of the place, which was kind of an old-school ""boys club"" environment that was sort of douchey.  At his new job, they recognize his good leadership skills.  The vibe at his new place just seems more collaborative and team-oriented in general, which helps!)"
CongratsLikeImFive,fnbojry,t3_g0owwk,1586819263.0,"Good for you!  I'm learning about how hard it is to advocate for yourself when experiencing depression, etc.  I was also prescribed something that didn't work and made my symptoms worse, so of course my doctor suggesting an increase of the medication that wasn't working...    I'm finally coming out of the fog of that bad prescription as I'm decreasing my dose.  I wish you the best of luck with the new medication!"

Plus, I'm just a few weeks older than him, so I can appreciate some of his cultural references, although 90210 wasn't all that impressionable to me...  

I can't imagine watching without the spoilers, it's the sort of show that's really not interesting enough to me on its own, especially lately with how young and instagram-interested the contestants are."
