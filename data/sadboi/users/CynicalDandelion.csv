The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parathyroid_hormone) on parathyroid says that a *mild* decrease in Mg stimulates PTH, while a *severe* decrease in Mg inhibits PTH, so maybe that explains the apparent contradiction.

Would lowering Mg supplementation (after long-time supplementation) stimulate PTH and cause calcium to be released into the serum?"

I've been taking magnesium for four years and I've been worried that it's causing problems, mainly joint and muscle pain. The most I ever took was 400mg per day, and now I take about 75 mg. But I had to come down really slowly, because every time I cut my magnesium, I would get the most insane, indescribable panic attacks. 

For a while I was under the impression that I should take calcium to balance the magnesium, but every time I tried that, my pain would get worse. I'd ache all over. Now it makes sense, if the magnesium had been increasing my calcium already. Too much calcium.

I've had my levels tested and, as you would guess, my serum levels were normal. I had a Mg RBC test, which showed me at the high end of the normal range. That's when I was supplementing with about 150 mg Mg/day.

Could Mg over time cause joint and muscle pain? It hasn't gone away, despite lowering the Mg, but maybe it would take me a while to rebalance? I don't know. Just wishing this pain had an explanation."
