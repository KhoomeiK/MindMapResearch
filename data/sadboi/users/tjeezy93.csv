I’ve had students come into my high intermediate level English class and not be able to speak a word of English (literally). I would not call that “high performing,” would you? 

I do agree with you on the making choices bit. Everyone needs to be held accountable for their actions. I just think we should have a little more empathy for the “problem” kids.

But maybe you guys in the States are frustrated because the government and society doesn’t respect the profession of teaching at all. Here in Canada we are  compensated quite well (despite recent budget cuts), so I think it’s our responsibility to do everything we can to do our job well."

Instead of demonizing “problem” students, we need to remember they are CHILDREN. There are always reasons for misbehaviour in class. It’s extremely tough to get to the point where a child feels safe to share with you what’s going on in their life, but your teaching and their learning improve tenfold when they do."

sugarlifestyleforum,eyr9h5c,t3_cyb2dr,1567363323.0,"This is the problem I have with this lifestyle. It’s hard to find a genuine connection without constantly having a question mark in the back of your head. I had the utmost fortune to meet a man with whom I share a deep intellectual, emotional, and sexual bond - I haven’t felt so cherished and respected by anyone since the man to whom I was formerly engaged. This will be my last SR.

The bowl is a funny place where people put on their best faces in exchange for something they desire (intimacy or money). It lacks the messiness of “real” relationships. But real human relationships ARE messy, and when you skip out on that you miss a whole level of vulnerability and connection that I find necessary for a fulfilling life: telling someone how you feel without being certain of the outcome; falling in love with someone you “shouldn’t”/in spite of insurmountable obstacles; sharing your darkest fears, shame, and desires despite the risk of judgment; opening your heart to and truly being seen by someone. This messy, ugly, raw place is where we are truly alive. 

And I think a lot of SRs are missing that, which makes me sad. Most SDs are married and forced to live a secret life. I don’t date married men anymore as a result of this; I don’t like the idea of a woman being left in the dark as to her husband’s true desires, instead of him being honest and vulnerable with her in sharing what he really wants from his life and relationships. I don’t like meeting in hotels and leaving before his “curfew,” instead of having a drink on his back patio and falling asleep together in his bed. I value authenticity and honesty more than anything else in my relationships. 

Totally unwarranted monologue no one asked for, but I wanted to share my POV on the issue. To each his own."
