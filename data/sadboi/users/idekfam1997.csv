depression,fmkh6d8,t1_fmjbot3,1586154816.0,Im moving in with my sister. She was my old room mate before. My mom leaves at her house with my dad is brothers. Currently where I live now. And I can tell you this. I’m independent and love to work. I definitely do not want kids now or in h the future. My goals are to travel the world and become fit. Just feeling stuck at the moment sucks.

Advice,f9x9aru,t3_dz4bwr,1575707104.0,"I’m using my work environment as an example because I’m always there, lol. 
If they’re teenagers, I just brush it off. Because they’re immature and will learn later. They don’t really better. Now people older than me. (22) I tend to want to know why they are. I want to get to the solution. Especially if I work with them. Mainly because I don’t do anything that would give a reason for someone to talk bad about. I’m nice to everyone, I give respect, and I do my fair share of work. I want to know what I did to piss YOU off. I don’t like working with negative people."

I constantly wish it would just erase from my memory, of course, it won’t tho. I don’t think I’m good enough for anything. In the back of my head all I think about is my dad calling me ugly, stupid, and fat. It happens daily. I understand what you’re going thru."

I’ve never dated so..... having a crush fucking hurts like HELL. When I’m 3ft away from a person I find attractive it HURTS for some reason. Just thinking about all the things I’m missing out. Cuddling, kissing, sex, ect. Makes me feel incredibly lonely. I don’t try to date. I over think about how I’m no good enough because of my bpd and how there are millions of other girls out there who are normal af. Look at me, I’m a 22 year old virgin train wreak, who has extremely low self esteem. My chances are ————— ZERO. 
Ugh, it’s sucks."
family,f9qsqn1,t1_f9qojby,1575566361.0,"Yes I’ll regret it. Yes sometimes I do the same and disrespect him when he pisses me off. He doesn’t work though. I actually provide food and stuff for my 3 little brothers.  My dad never buys groceries for them. My mom works but barley makes it. So I step my foot in so I could help. I’ve been helping my mom pay for food and stuff since I was 17. I still live with my parents since I left the house I was renting. My dad blows up over little things. If he can’t find the remote, he blows up.  If one of my little brother’s drank his coke, he’ll blow up. If he doesn’t have cigarettes, he’ll blow up. I know he’s my dad I need to treat him with respect, but it’s pisses me that he hasn’t worked for years and treats me and my siblings like were mistakes. He just sucks as a dad. He has never been to any of our graduations. He doesn’t celebrate any of our birthdays or even buys us presents (which doesn’t even matter yet we always make he has a good birthday and Christmas). Idk what his problem is. I just don’t ever want to end up like him. If I ever have kids, I don’t ever want to make them feel like shit. (Sorry if this rant was hostile or whatever. I just have a lot of this bottled up.)"

All of my friends literally have a bf. I have had chances to lose my v card. I don’t want to lose it to any random weird dudes tho. Plus I have a really hard time talking to guys in real life. Usually when I’m attractive to a guy, I tend to avoid them because I’m so fucking scared of rejection and having my heart broken. I know someday I’ll get my first everything lol. I’m pretty sure you will too."
