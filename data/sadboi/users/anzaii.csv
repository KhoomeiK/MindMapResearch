Including online presentations, I’m sure your coworkers would understand some of your feelings if they were presenting, or at least I hope they would at least try to understand. 

For me personally whenever I am beating myself up over things I remind myself I did the best I could. I did what I had to do in order to complete the task, and nothing is perfect. I can’t hold myself to perfect standards because there is no such place like that, it only exists in my mind to torment me. I just have to take what i am at the moment and understand i tried my best.

And remember that the only person that can make you feel bad is yourself. No matter how uncontrollable anxiety can be when it comes to a feeling someone else makes you feel your anxiety will pinpoint and warp it to panic automatically. Just try to manage the best you can and know you can choose to feel less bad sometimes by taking a stand against your anxiety and mentally telling it no and that you are stronger than your feelings of fear."

Anxiety,fnmkxrs,t3_g2hdl0,1587073298.0,"Hey OP, this resonates a lot with me also. I've suffered from anxiety pretty much my whole life, got handed a bad hand, and kinda have to learn to be my own ""parent"" while having so many issues of my own. Through my life I have often just wanted to not exist, to watch the world but it not watch me. A lot of what you said I've gone through, and still go through. 

What I find helps best is to focus on what I do that no one else can do. Whether it be taking care of my birds, and taking care of plants...being understanding and always open to listen to others, I feel like these things only I can do in my own way. I guess it's small things I can control, and that don't spiral me out of control. I know that wanting to not exist can spiral me into negative self talk, so I try my best to not...it's been hard and some days are better than others but I know I am the only one who can be so hard on myself. I am the one making myself suffer, and I know if it was someone else I'd never want them to suffer the way I can make myself feel.

You mentioned you are on meds, which is a good step to trying to get a better grip on all this...have you told your doctor of any increasing anxiety? If not I would highly recommend you do as they have the best ideas as to balance your meds and also you don't want this increased anxiety being a negative side effect...just be open and honest, they are there to help you and you might feel better having someone listen whose job it is to help you. If your doctor can't provide this for you I would recommend counseling, I know it might be a big step but for me having someone outside of myself to talk to really illuminates the fact my thinking is very warped towards myself."

She slowly realizes it. Her family is known for fire and blood, her father was the mad king, she was only born in westeros and everyone else has a stronger claim than she does. Yet all signs point to her as being the best ruler, be it prophecy that the books really hint at, or the idea of “mheesa” the show really put forth. She will give birth to the rider that mounts the world. Her time in westeros changes her to go mad...the show was bad at showing it but the signs are there. After fighting the great “other”, not just following her own plans, and finally finding love only for it to betray her I really think she had it with westeros and its people. If they do not bend she breaks. It’s true to what she knows. It’s a true twist, which the show should have focused more on since it is so tragic. She could have just left back to essos to live as a queen but I think the loss toll really affects her...idk I dont think she is right or wrong, just a tragic tale in a song of ice and fire."

We can all agree tho the states has a horrid health record. Insurance companies care about profit not people. Need to flip that. Universal for all or it won’t work here imo.

sandiego,et91jjw,t3_cai7py,1562581550.0,"Honestly when I want to be amazed by trees I walk through older parts of the city awing at giant magnolia and fig trees 100+ years old. No forests here of trees but we have other plant wonders. The chaparral mesas are wonderful. SD is mediterranean micro climates, try exploring our little pocket parks like cabrillo park or the mission valley river trail. 

Also Chula Vista literally means hot vista...don’t think that’s the right area for lotsa forests :P but you can always help by growing more trees ^_^"

I have so much experience with plants and would love to work with them but I have bad social anxiety and working retail really doesn’t work for me. Is there any classes or programs that could steer me in the direction of working at such a large nursery? Ty very very much!"
BernieSanders,eryytyl,t1_erynzyt,1561421141.0,"Please correct me if wrong, but aren’t the whole appeal of medical degrees that you’ll make a lot of money in the medical field and pay everything off? Not trying to start something. Do you agree in free college for all? 

I know you said that it rewards people that made bad choices. Your choice in education should allow you to experiment with various subjects. Knowledge is power. The people who will benefit from this is your neighbors, your friends, their children. People who need it. 

I am sorry you feel it does not benefit you but try to think of the millions who need this break when their back is already broken. It takes someone so strong to get through this"
lostgeneration,eryxe45,t1_erxx125,1561420023.0,"/u/rawscallop, I do not know you, but if I could I would give you a big hug and tell you your story is so heartbreaking. How are you doing? How are you mentally? I won’t go into much unless you would like, but my parents are dead also. Blood poisoning and alcoholism. They will never know who i grew up to be. They had dreams. All I wish is that everyone had a chance to find what they want to do in this world and share it. 

Money SHOULD NOT EQUAL POWER. 

Keep up hope, I know it’s hard but I have faith that once our generation gets more involved in politics maybe we can make it finally. Truly for the people. idk but we can all work together."

Instagramreality,erv6gw4,t1_erulhyk,1561307693.0,"Back in my Myspace days I thought i was a photoshop wizard and would edit myself in all sorts of ways. I was sad and obese, wanted to die and the only way I was able to cope was pretending to be something I wasn’t (not saying any of these people are, just why i did it). I wanted myself to believe so hard that I refused to believe anyone would notice. Of course my best friend pointed it out immediately and I never did it again lol. How these people have no people around them to call them out and to be happy about themselves is so sad. 

Photo editing is so much easier now. It’s a filter rather than an entire program. I think this easy accessibility makes it so people with low self esteem can sorta artificially make it. And as a 20 something now dealing with harmful coping mechanisms learned in my yourh, lemme tel you that lying to yourself shit doesn’t work. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FEEL LOVE FOR YOURSELF. Your brain, your chemicals. Shout it far, scream is loud, no amount of lying to yourself will make you feel consistently good."

sandiego,erptpje,t1_erpqxwk,1561127772.0,"Do you think that the drug wars made the addicted homeless population worse? I think it is indeed a very major mental heath crisis, but these people do need to be “coddled”, they have no one.

What would you do if you had no family, friends. Either they are dead, bot stable themselves, or just gave up on you. The only people around you will either steal you blind, or are just going to eventually. Everyone else thinks you are nothing.

You have to give these peolple hope that the future CAN be better and they are not drains on society. It’s not easy living on the streets, no one wants to do it and drugs are the only way to deal with that stress.

It is a long, long process to get clean. But someone who has hope, can hold on to it to try and get better. It takes years to get to the point of addiction, and it takes years to get out. 

If we stop arresting people for being junkies and get them proper care we can do it. See what programs do work, and don’t work in SF and LA. Also note these areas are gentrifying fast. The divide between rich and poor is forcing people out of their homes with no help. Some places rent are raising by ridiculous amounts. 

Talk to former homeless. Get them all involved, pay them well, and eventually I think we can slowly deal with the drug issue.

Mental health is a whole other beast."
sandiego,erpsjcw,t1_erp7cov,1561126954.0,"Not trying to be rude or neglect your worry for safety, but I do question why you think putting people who have nothing, in our messed up jail system. How do you expect people who have nothing pay for their way out of jail? 

Keep clean programs? How do you keep clean on the streets? How do you keep clean if you need meds but don’t even know what day, hour, anything is? 

It’s sad on both fronts really. But as a former addict and soneone in the SD mental health system the other side is much sadder. To get to the point to steal out of cars in alleys is rock rock bottom. It’s a slow suicide because parts of you just slowly die, mentally especially. I hope they get the help they need. No one is born dreaming of breaking into cars.

Instead of seeing homeless people as harming you, would you ever consider volunteering or donating to causes that try to help these people? I think if we all pitch in we could help. I know the most important thing for me is to just know people care. If you see the same homeless people in your neighborhoods how about just talking to them? Idk...I just feel like using a cell phone to read about people you don’t know but scare you is kinda...fucked. It makes the divide bigger when we are all just people wanting to find happiness. 

Show respect, and eventually you will be met with respect."
