relationship_advice,fqujk2l,t3_gkvb89,1589659962.0,"I think this is a serious red flag. You have repeatedly asked him to stop. Something is only funny when both people are humored. It‚Äôs bullying when only one finds it funny. 
The time when he tackled you hard enough to knock food away AND you already had tender bruises from an accident. That‚Äôs seriously wrong and the fact he deflected instead of apologizing is wrong.  
You deserve better. 
PS. In case this matters, I am 61 and have been in and seen a number of relationships. I think you should proceed with caution."

It was actually sort of scary cause he just tried to find any way to contact me. Totally creepy. I even made a police report. -  I did wonder afterwards if I‚Äôd been wearing my ring if it would have stopped him.  (Keep in mind, I‚Äôm 61, and have never been one who has to fight off admirers!)
