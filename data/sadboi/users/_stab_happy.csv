If it was something I felt like I should want or was only considering because I was programmed to think that way, then I would choose something different. 

I applied this to clothes shopping to better develop my own sense of style. I applied it to college and career choices so I wasn't just doing what they wanted for me. I even applied this to food choices! Growing up, all we ever ate was meat and potatoes, and my mom would always say how ethnic food smells like garbage and criticize the ethnicities of the people cooking the good. When I grew up, I tried it, and it turns out, I really love ethnic food!

When it came to worrying about what other people think, it was a little bit harder. I came out of my shell slowly to people and when I kept noticing that they didn't freak out or rage hate on things I liked, I started to feel more comfortable opening up, but it still look a long time. It was so weird the first few times I shared my interests with coworkers and they didn't tell me what a terrible person I am or how stupid of a thing that is to like.

There might also be free support groups that you could join. ACOA, which typically is for adult children of alcoholics, will often allow abuse victims to join as well.  

I've read several books that have helped me understand myself and situation better. Here are a few that come to mind :
- Dysfunction Interrupted by Audrey Sherman
- Childhood Disrupted by Donna Jackson Nakazawa
- The Emotionally Absent Mother by Jasmin Lee Cori

I also watch a lot of mental health videos on YouTube. Two of my favorite channels:
- Kati Morton - She's a real life therapist and posts a TON of videos on a large variety of mental health topics. She's amazing! 
- Julia Christina Counselling - Another real life therapist. I don't like her as much as Kati, but she's still really good.

I have a close group of friends, but I don't like talking about what happened in my childhood.  I'm afraid of being a ""debbie downer"" of the conversation.  But occasionally I'll casually respond in a conversation with something that doesn't seem like a big deal, but it turns out to be quite revealing.  Like when my girlfriends got talking about how they used to cuddle or snuggle with their parents as a child, and their parents could console them if they had a bad day.  And I responded about how my mom refused to snuggle with me and would send me to my room for ""having an attitude"" if I'd had a bad day.

Now, as an adult, when I speak to my therapist, when I hear myself speak, it feels like I'm talking about a movie I watched, not the abuse I endured for half of my life.

As a young child, we would stay at my uncle's house until late and drive home well past bedtime.  My mom would insist that my sister and I stay awake because she didn't want to have to carry us inside.  She would blast music to deafening levels and open the window all the way in the winter in an effort to keep us awake.

* Get your social security card and birth certificate before you walk out the door.  It will be A LOT harder to get on your own later.
* If you're able to, get a copy of any immunization records or family medical history.  When you get to the point where you need to go to a doctor, they will ask a ton of questions about it, and knowing is better than guessing.
* Learn how to budget.  This will be invaluable early on because you probably won't be making much money, and it might be hard to keep track of expenses.   Websites like [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) are great at doing this.
* Make sure to file a forwarding address with the Post Office when you move.  This means that any of your mail sent to your previous address will be forwarded to your new address for a year after it's filed.
* Basic skills like cooking are always useful so you don't blow your paycheck eating out all the time.
* Make sure any savings/checking accounts are in your name only, so you're parents don't have access to them.
* Get a credit card but PAY IT OFF EVERY MONTH!  Do not abuse it, and don't spend more than you have.  Use it for things like gas or groceries that you know you can pay off.  It's important to build up a good credit history, but make sure you do not run yourself into debt.  It will only hurt you in the long run.
* Be respectful to people like employers, landlords/rental agencies, etc. even if they are a terrible boss or slum lord.  They can have an influence on your ability to get a future job or future apartment.  
* Find someone who can act as a surrogate parent or someone you feel comfortable enough to ask questions.  Problems may arise along the way, and it will be helpful to have someone to confide in who can guide you.

That's so exciting that you were followed your dreams and were able to accomplish so much despite her constant negativity!  You should be so proud of yourself!"

She made an effort to let my sister and I know that ""it's her turn to have a life now"" and turned all her anger and aggression out on us while expecting us to serve her every need.

raisedbynarcissists,exdhjv0,t1_excocfd,1566176844.0,"Very much this. My parents would shelter me, not show me to leave the house, get a job, my driver's license or hang out with friends. Then, they would pick on me for not having friends.

If I ever needed anything, I was supposed to ask them. But that resulted in being a shamed and treated like a burden for having needs. To the point where I had rashes on my legs for two years, and instead of taking me to the doctor, they accused me of dry shaving my legs like that caused it. I also had a broken tooth and was in terrible pain for 6 months before they took me to a dentist and made them fix it without novocaine because they said it was too expensive."

I experienced similar shaming and verbal assault when I would get upset. My NMom's go-to line was ""Oh don't whine to me about your problems.

I don't understand how someone can be so inhumane."

I merely meant that MY therapist is the one that gave ME the suggestion as how to deal with her.  My mother doesn't believe in therapists either, nor does she think that there's anything wrong with her, just me.

&#x200B;

It actually wasn't that difficult for me.  I just moved on with my life.  The only time it's an issue for me is when other people insert their opinions about how I deal with her.  People generally suggest that I try to maintain a relationship with her, or they think I'm a terrible child for cutting her out of my life.  I get that they don't fully understand the situation, but it's still hard to try to explain when people have already formed their opinions."
raisedbynarcissists,erogrup,t3_c2yt0a,1561078568.0,"I used to give her only one line replies on the suggestion of a therapist. But that only elicited more questions and attempts at contacting me. Some time ago, I decided to go fully NC. 

Since then, I ignore her phone calls and text messages. I've stopped listening to the voicemails because they were all about how she couldn't understand what she'd done to make me hate her.  I don't hate her. I just don't want her to be part of my life.

If any other family member asks why I have been ignoring her (because, of course, she's told everyone), I simply tell them that I've been focusing more on myself and my future."
raisedbynarcissists,erihczl,t3_c26fc2,1560897682.0,"Unfortunately. I wasn't allowed to leave the house, or be in sports, or even have a job because that meant I would be around other people and not under their control. When I turned 18, they kicked me out of their house. I was lost and confused. I felt like I didn't know how to function in the real world because I was never allowed to be part of it. I was even terrified to go to the grocery store by myself.

Fast forward 15 years, I'm still awkward in social situations, but I'm far more well-adjusted than I was."
raisedbynarcissists,erigxdh,t3_c1ztb0,1560897365.0,"Yes. Doctor, dentist, therapist, etc. I couldn't even get my driver's license until I was 18 because they didn't want to have to put me on their car insurance. I was severely depressed and suicidal, and the only thing they ever did was to tell me to stop being such a drama queen.

Many years later, at 34, I'm working my way through therapy for cptsd from their abuse, and I finally went to an orthodontist for braces. I have to work extra hard to take care of myself now to undo the damage they've done."
