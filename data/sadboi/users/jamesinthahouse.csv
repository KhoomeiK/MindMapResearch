AdultEducation,fpdpkzz,t3_g0uh5d,1588531666.0,"I've worked in Public Education Secretary in São Paulo, Brazil, and I am the coordinator of adults education nuclei here. We're using Ms Teams to intercommunication and to promote meetings with the principals. The official platform between school/teachers and students is Google Classroom. But just because there is a partnership between local goverment, MS and Google.  The problem is: It's a developing country and a large number of people don't have full access to this tools or are able to use it. So, in practice, they usualy are using WhatsApp to remain closer to the students, because its too more popular and accesseble."
