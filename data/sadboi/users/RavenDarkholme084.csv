EatCheapAndHealthy,fp8k34g,t3_gbi8g0,1588394392.0,"Pro tip: once the lime juice has ‚Äúcooked‚Äù the fish, add some of the jalape√±o vinegar (the vinegar where jalape√±os come in) and also get tostadas or chips (like restaurants chips) but I prefer the tostadas. Put the ceviche on top of the tostada, add the hot sauce (Valentina is good with this). 

Now this sounds strange, but some states in south Mexico add ketchup as a topping once served. It‚Äôs optional.

I usually don‚Äôt put the fresh jalape√±os in it, just the jalape√±o vinegar but if you like the taste, you could use a food processor and put the jalape√±os from the jar (not all, just a few slices) in there. Also, I don‚Äôt cut the fish, I put it in the food processor but it depends on what you prefer."

I cannot remember if concentra falls under the ‚Äústimulant‚Äù area but since all ADHD cause the same effects, it would be closely related to the ‚Äústimulant‚Äù body effects. Usually drugs that stimulate the (sns) will be contraindicated in people with anything that has to do with constricted vessels (arteries/veins) and history of eye problems like glaucoma since it will further construct the little vessels in the eye and potentially cause permanent damage since there is no good blow flow to that area.

I suggest you make an appointment with a psychiatrist and talk it out and see what solutions you can come up with. It will be very exhausting trying to force yourself to do things if you lack motivation then you will feel terribly, somewhat guilty for not doing things. I promise you‚Äôre not the only one. Don‚Äôt feel down because of it, seek help, talk to close friends, or people that understand what this is like.

PlasticSurgery,evw53se,t1_eugj6pl,1564855349.0,"The lids closed as they healed. Eve after the post-op swelling went down, two weeks after surgery, I was still having trouble when waking up from my sleep. My eyes would burn a bit. No additional procedures. I give the results a 8/10 mainly because I wake up feeling pressure on my left eyelid. I blame the blepharochalisis for that. I feel like I still retain liquids in my eyelid and this is causing the pressure overall but since I had the surgery and the doctor reconstructed a muscle that had ripped before, this is not letting the eyelid swell up.

How do I explain this? Before, my eyelid was so loose that when I slept, it would fill up with liquids like a small balloon. 

Now since I had a muscle in there re-attached (it was ripped), and skin removed, I do not have that extra space for the eyelid to fill up with liquids.

Now when I wake up, I still feel the pressure on my eyelid and some burning sensation in my eye along with some tears on the left eye. 

It looks MUCH better than before. I am happy I did the surgery for sure I just hope that I won't need another one. I have had 2 surgeries in the past 5 years for the same issue."
