trees,fkreqz8,t1_fkre0q9,1584467407.0,Huge increase in flavor and I love the flavor but that‚Äôs really dependent on the strain. I had some Soul assassin that I will never vape again because of its ‚Äúdiesel‚Äù type flavor.  Where I‚Äôve also had Str8 Lemonade that had an amazing citrus like flavor. You‚Äôre not emptying ash but AVB which can later be used for tinctures or other things.  I haven‚Äôt learned how to do that but with what‚Äôs going on with Coronavirus I probably will read up on it. I do have to grind it fine but I‚Äôm not compulsive about it.  I use a Pax 2 vaporizer and now they have Pax 3.  Of course there are plenty of brands and types of vaporizers to choose from.  I went with Pax because it‚Äôs portable and fits my lifestyle better.
