I have had to deal with something kind of similar. My approach was to think about what the possible outcomes are for this situation. Ideally, they would take the pandemic as seriously as you, and follow the recommendations of the CDC. Unfortunately that probably won’t happen. So, I thought if I can appeal to them with the facts and encourage them to follow those regulations, but also be clear that I understand it’s their right and responsibility to do what they believe is right... other posters may say “I wouldn’t send my kid” etc, but unfortunately that’s not an option. If someone is in your home that is at a greater risk, that may cause you to consider having your step child stay with BM for the duration of the pandemic - but that also has its own risks as far as potential custodial issues later. It’s SO frustrating to not be on the same page parenting wise. BUT if you can appeal to them somehow...not accusing... just talking... that may help the situation.

My ex took BD10 on a hike with friends a few weeks back. It was not an attempt at a social distancing hang out, they just went on a hike. It definitely could have been worse, but I was unhappy. I gave myself some time to process and thought about it. I sent him an email stating my concerns, and how much I value when we are on the same page. I was nonthreatening, emotionless, and stated the facts. The outcome was that he called it a mistake, not really owning the decision, but assured me he would be more mindful. He continues to take her into stores and he does seem to socialize in person with at least one person on a regular basis. But he is not planning gatherings (that I know of) when my BD10 is there. Not ideal, but better than nothing I guess. My SS10 also has been brought to social gatherings. His mother is immunocompromised so it’s actually surprising that’s the choice that she’s making. We have not addressed his, and I’m not sure if we will or not... Legally we don’t have anyway to prevent the “other” parents from making these decisions, despite how they may impact us. We have to communicate - in your situation it’s likely your SO that would be doing the communicating. 

We only have control over our own households. I am intensely anxious about this lack of control over the situation so I have just been really trying to follow the CDC’s recommendations to a T in our house to at least manage it the best we can. I encourage hand washing every time we come inside, before meals, we have masks for our entire household if we ever needed to take the kids out, but we plan our outings so that only one adult is entering the store, etc. We just have to do what we can. I wish you the best of luck. Maybe you and your SO can work together to write up an email or text."

stepparents,fmw8fqr,t1_fmvt3m1,1586441731.0,"I came here to say this, it’s spot on. I am going through something less drastic but similar with my BD10. Her dad has always been a one or two day a week parent, leaving the responsibility of caring for BD to his parents a lot of the time she was in his care. Recently, he sort of woke up and is playing a more active role in her life. I don’t know how genuine it is, I’m praying for my BD’s sake it will last. But, his track record for 10 years hasn’t been great. My BD is OBSESSED with him all of a sudden, constantly talking about him and all these great ideas he has (that are generally normal adult suggestions and not anything really extraordinary), or she will bring up things he “taught” her that was absolutely not him. But... I just try to be the constant for her as I always have. It is HARD to not roll my eyes at it all, or to correct her every time she says something about how wonderful and smart he is.  

I just have to remember that I am the norm - she has never gone without me in her life. Which is how it should be. And I can just continue to do what’s right. Your SD will see, looking back, that you and your SO were always there. You are doing the right thing. As much as it sucks not to be appreciated.... trust me I really understand!!!"

We have done all sorts of therapy, counseling, and found a medicine regiment that has helped quite a lot, I do want you to know that even with consistency, and doing all the “right” things, we still see tantrums and outbursts. There has been a big improvement over the years with a lot of hard work, but.... it’s still the number one struggle in my life/marriage. We have SS10 Sunday evening until Friday evening. We coparent with BM and discuss his struggles but I don’t think she has the same  structure, expectations, or consequences in their home as we do. My DH has gotten a lot better and more involved over the years since the initial diagnosis. The first few years were so difficult for our marriage. Money was tight, we had a new baby after we got married, DH worked 2 jobs, I had 3 kids home by myself, etc. All while learning how to manage SS and his behavior. It’s truly a learning curve. It’s HARD. There are still moments of weakness where I’d love to run in the other direction as fast as I can. But step parents choose the role they have in the lives of the step child(ren).... mine has been to push DH to be the dad that SS needs, to be a constant in SS10’s life that he lacked when he was a baby, and we have had some huge growth. I wouldn’t suggest to anyone to get involved in the situation I found myself in, but I stepped in when SS was 3.... I pushed for early intervention, counseling, 504 plan etc. It has all been for the best, and worth it. My DH and I are very much in love, I do care for SS10, and I have loved building a family together (me, DH, SS10, BD10, and BD4).

You are the adult, this is your home. It’s also her home, but it sounds like the change in her staying there more means you all need to establish some clear boundaries and expectations. Maybe it is a family discussion that needs to happen where everyone talks about their wants and needs, and then everyone can agree on certain things, maybe write them down and go from there. Some examples could be:

Bedrooms are where we will all sleep, not in the living space.
Family game/puzzle nights are every Thursday.
No TV in the living room from 5-6pm every day. 
Daily chores for SD. 

All of what you’re saying is not unreasonable and would be ideal that you figure it out before your baby comes. I think it’s nice that SD wants to be at your home. Your playing with her probably is making her feel loved and cared for, even if it’s not what you want to be doing. So - my advice would be to establish boundaries and compromise. If DH doesn’t want to establish those expectations, you still can. You don’t have to play puzzles every day or allow the TV to be on when you want to rest."

You may have a reason that eating is uncomfortable whether it’s psychological or physical - but it could be as simple as taking an antacid to relieve some physical symptoms. A doctor could really help you get to the bottom of this.

The suggestion to try meal replacement shakes is a great one. Carnation instant breakfast isn’t the most nutrient dense but are really yummy and could help your appetite. I’ve also heard great things about premier protein. Is there anything you do like to consume? Like coffee or cereal? You could try to make a protein dense/fat dense coffee drink by making bulletproof coffee (it has butter in it which sounds gross but if you blend it it’s so delicious!). If you enjoy cereal you could try adding a scoop of granola to your cereal, or eat your cereal with whole milk yogurt. How do you feel about ice cream? My son is underweight to no fault of his own - just not interested in stopping to eat most of the time. His doc recommended just pumping something into him that he really likes. So we started making these insane milkshakes every day using heavy cream, carnation powder, protein powder, ice cream, and anything else he wanted in it. It was effective."

However, I do know a woman who chooses 2-3 palettes per month to get use from and I thought wow, what a neat idea to maximize the use of your collection! Either way - don’t feel bad. It should bring you joy!"
Connecticut,ezayic5,t1_ezay40k,1567809828.0,We actually wanted rural cow town vibes... for privacy ha. We have 3 kids in a small ranch so privacy is pretty foreign to us these days!

stepparents,ez95x5k,t3_d0ezp2,1567773934.0,"So, I have a SS10 and BD9. We have been working hard on phone skills for this reason (we have both full time!) I would suggest to your SD to get phone numbers of her friends and call them to plan something to do at your place - maybe you could purchase an address or contact book for her to write them down in and keep at your house. At 9, they can entertain themselves together. She is old enough to entertain herself otherwise, and also phone friends to get together. If you’re willing to pick up a friend or help her plan something with a friend, she may be able to have those friendships from her BMs carry over to your home."
stepparents,eymdyxx,t3_cxn5wl,1567206380.0,It’s very possible that you can send a check or cash into the school and it will be added to their account! We are able to use an app and also pay through the school.

relationship_advice,exicz8g,t3_csw8po,1566325789.0,"I grew up with a similar allergy. More exposure can mean faster, scarier reactions. I used to have to ingest to react, and now if an allergen even touches my skin, I react. From experience, I agree that some strict boundaries are necessary because your child’s safety is at risk. Maybe MIL could visit your pediatrician with you and the doctor could explain the seriousness of this allergy. That is something I would need her to hear and acknowledge, as well as agreement to carry the epi at all times, in order to take my child out unsupervised."

toddlers,ew5rkv1,t1_ew5l978,1565143341.0,"We did something like this as well - but we packed up all the pacifiers in a box and the “binky fairy” brought the pacifiers to the babies who needed them and left my daughter a soft blanket, a stuffed animal, and a little pack of candy. She still sleeps with the stuffed animal almost 2 years later."

drugstoreMUA,evvdear,t1_evv1cts,1564832366.0,"I didn’t love this concealer either and now use a tiny bit to mix with my eyeshadow primer to make it more of my skin toned and it works well for that. Under my eyes it creased and I didn’t find it was similar to shape tape like everyone else said.

My drug store foundation favorite is L’Oréal pro-glow! I have normal to oily skin and I still love it! The matte one is good too! My FAV concealer is the nyx HD color correcting concealer. It’s slightly peachy undertone blends out really well while still color correcting! I do mix it with heavier concealer for a full face (not drug store) but no make up make up days it’s my HG!"

stepparents,evrd1kx,t1_evr929l,1564705778.0,"I would just keep doing that consistently, maybe up the intensity. Eventually you will find something that means enough to her that she will take less often/stop. I wouldn’t involve mom other than keeping her in the loop about what’s going on. Some kids are tougher to “crack” than others. My SS10 requires consistency in everything no matter what or he can end up going off the rails, where BD9 is more flexible and can understand when/why rules could be bent one time but not most other times etc.  

What are the real life consequences for stealing? Arrest (know any cops willing to have a chat with her? Not actually arrest her but maybe the intensified authority will help it sink in?) Paying back for the stolen items (maybe chores could have a monetary value?), paying fines (more chores, we work hard for our money and if you steal, you will work hard too), and sometimes jail (grounding, less privacy, take extras out of her room, no screens/extra fun activities). She will either eventually learn not to steal or she will end up with grown up consequences as a teen/adult."
stepparents,evr6xhe,t3_ckua2f,1564702541.0,"She’s 9. She should know better - like you said, when she was 5 it was one thing. This is something else. It’s time for some consequences. You may need to consult with SO depending on how you choose to parent together but in my house the child would lose something of theirs if they kept taking things without asking. I have SS10, BD9, and BD3. My SS10 used up 3/4 of a bottle of my expensive body wash playing in the shower recently. He then lost screen time privileges.  

These things your SD is taking are yours; you don’t need to justify why you need or want to have them. 

It’s probably good practice to keep valuable or expensive things out of her reach, but the things that are replaceable and it’s more just annoying than anything, I would approach this as an opportunity to teach her that she is not entitled to take things that don’t belong to her just because they are there. Not sure how much you’ve talked with her about this but I would clearly lay out boundaries and consequences and then be sure to follow through with consequences. “If you continue to take my water bottle/lotion/nail polish/whatever without permission, you will lose screen time privileges/have to do extra chores/be grounded/whatever. There will be a consequence every time I find something of mine in your space.”"
aldi,evr57kv,t1_evr2kc2,1564701835.0,No not at all! It’s got a good green salsa flavor! A little spice but nothing major.
drugstoreMUA,evlqexc,t1_evloeux,1564597877.0,"Sure, it depends on the foundation you chose but if you get one that is buildable light to medium coverage. 

You can also mix a medium-full foundation (or whatever you might already have for your face) with some regular moisturizer to put on your neck if you didn’t want to purchase multiple products or a light/sheer foundation just for your neck."
drugstoreMUA,evlnwtk,t1_evlj16y,1564596989.0,My face and neck are light and my chest/arms are lighter. I use foundation and bronzer to blend it in on my neck when I wear make up. I have a darker foundation that’s very lightweight that is sheer coverage which makes it feel just like my neck but appears to be close in color to my chest. Maybe a tinted moisturizer or BB cream would be more comfortable?

As for shopping...

Don’t get sucked in to more is better when it comes to anything perishable. If you want to buy fresh fruit, buy things you can buy 1 or 2 of. Apples, peaches, bananas, etc. you CAN break apart a bunch of bananas to only by 2 and you don’t need to buy the pre-bagged bulk oranges. Hand pick out what you know you will actually eat. You will save money and be less wasteful. The same goes for fresh veggies, but you can also get frozen vegetables that are just as good and you don’t have to worry about them going bad. 

If you find a sale on meats, you can buy a bunch of it at once and freeze individual portions. Make sure you use FREEZER bags, not just storage bags, and write the date on it and what it is in a sharpie though. 

Pastas, rice, quinoa, cous cous, cans or jars of sauce. Staples for your meals. Cereal or oatmeal. 

Single yogurts (unless you will eat the same flavor and eat it every day, then buy the one larger container). Cheese sticks and crackers are great to have on hand if you. Bagels or English muffins if you’ll eat them - honestly it makes for more interesting PB&J or turkey sandwich and also mixes up options for breakfast.

You’ll figure out what you like to buy and what you actually eat. It won’t take long! Some people shop more often through the week picking up only enough for a day or two (not sure how convenient that’d be for you) in an effort to save money."
stepparents,ev7lmfi,t3_ciaxcd,1564261260.0,"Your wedding is your day, but your wedding is also only ONE day, the first day of your marriage. Seems like “duh!” BUT this issue you’re having with SO and inviting BM to the wedding is something that could either impact your marriage long term - is that what you want? Does he really want her there for support, or did it just seem like the nice thing to do when asked? Will he resent you if you don’t invite her? Will you resent him if you do invite her? You guys need to communicate and be understanding. This is a sensitive topic on both ends.

But! If BM is LC, and she’s pleasant and lovely, and SO and SK wants her there, is it not something to consider? JUST like it’s totally reasonable for SO to be considering NOT inviting her! Weigh out the pros and cons, discuss it, and decide from there. I’m sure (if she’s LC) BM would understand if someone explained “we have only X amount of spots, and had to adjust our guest list accordingly.” Weddings are so stressful to plan and blended families often have blurred lines. Sometimes you have to navigate that carefully to avoid hurting yourself, your SO/SK, and others involved. I wish you the best of luck in working this out!"
