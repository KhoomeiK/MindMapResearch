emetophobia,fpiynlj,t3_gd7stn,1588651900.0,I just got out of an outpatient group for dual diagnosis. The main reason I went was for my increased anxiety because of my fear which turned to terrible panic attacks and I started using drugs again. I will always agree 100% it can make you sick and control your life. I‚Äôve been out of the group for a week now and I‚Äôve been doing ok but my anxiety has been high And I‚Äôm trying everything to stay calm. God bless you and try to keep your mind busy; I found that helped me !! And tea either ginger tea or mint. They help your stomach and digestion and the warmth can really calm you.

But it doesn‚Äôt hurt to try since you said you ate something that didn‚Äôt agree with you. But for food poisoning relief I think you would feel better with pepto

Don‚Äôt wanna go to stores or shopping (fucking loved doing this) But I love going to work and school. I also have anxiety and keeping myself busy and going out and doing things is what I need to be doing, but I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs beed rough I feel ya"
BipolarReddit,fanbudl,t3_e9ohin,1576233700.0,"Been on 300‚Äômg of lithium (2 pills twice a day so 1200mg) for 5 years. Acid amongst other pills/drugs were my go to for a verrrrrrryyyyyyy long time. I did a lot of acids before being on lithium, but the first and last time I took acid on lithium I had a seizure. Was in the hospital for 5 days. I have dealt with serious paranoia, panic attacks and flashbacks ever since. Changed who I am completely. Keep in mind this was 3 years ago. 

I guess everyone‚Äôs different"
Anxiety,fan8ly5,t1_fakxtmr,1576229050.0,Needed to hear this. Had anxiety all day and just had a panic attack. Started with anxiety thoughts and worrying then my ‚Äústomach‚Äù to then the usual routine I do. Ugh it scares me so much I hate myself when I go through it I get depressed. Then afterwards I‚Äôm super tired like I had a hangover. I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out and everytime it happens no matter what I try to do it always finds its way back. Between anxiety and a fear of throwing up it‚Äôs been one hell of a ride. Thank you for reaching out it makes me feel less lonley and very less crazy much love to ya an definitely will reach out thank you
