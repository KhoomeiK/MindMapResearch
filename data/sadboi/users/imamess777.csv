Long story short I’ve been addicted to Benzos for 6-7 years and I’m also n alcoholic (recovering) thank god. But please be careful! I would see what your options are first cus I started with atavan and now I’m heavily addicted to k pins. You also no your body but I’m saying from my experience and the people i have talked to that have bipolar. There’s something called Hydroxyzine that’s not a be so but helps with anxiety.

emetophobia,fpiynlj,t3_gd7stn,1588651900.0,I just got out of an outpatient group for dual diagnosis. The main reason I went was for my increased anxiety because of my fear which turned to terrible panic attacks and I started using drugs again. I will always agree 100% it can make you sick and control your life. I’ve been out of the group for a week now and I’ve been doing ok but my anxiety has been high And I’m trying everything to stay calm. God bless you and try to keep your mind busy; I found that helped me !! And tea either ginger tea or mint. They help your stomach and digestion and the warmth can really calm you. I send peace ✌🏾

I’m 22 now and my biggest issue is dealing with friends and the social/college life. Everyone wants to drink or do drugs. It can be lonely but I just remind myself how strong I have become and I learn to enjoy the lonely times. Trust me if you want it you will achieve it

I lost myself trying to take care of him and now I’m back to where I was before I was clean. It’s an exhausting and deliberating cycle. But the best thing to do is find help for yourself and take care of yourself. Don’t loose sight to that. Talk to your support about it and surround yourself with people who don’t bring you down for your relationship but are there for you. You can direct message me if you want to talk more.

I think mine has to do with lack of sleep to no sleep and I just started a whole new schedule today. I get this a lot and have to continuously calm myself down and remind myself that it’s anxiety.

BipolarReddit,fe5qsk0,t3_enp80z,1578873182.0,"i went through something like this 4 1/2 years ago when i just started lithium. i was SUPER manic. thought my now boyfriend was going to ask me out but i needed to leave class at exactly at 2:07 (class got out at 2:10 smh) left my backpack with my phones, house keys etc in it, thinking my not boyfriend at the time told my friend to hold onto it and later would go to her house and get it. then i started on this 2 hour long journey i thought he sent on to pick ""a good path in life or bad path"". finally i ended up back at my bestfriends house with no shoes covered in mood thinking he was there. then i finally met up with him and it was the biggest embarrassment of my life lol. also thought every camera, hole, song on the radio, light was him. during this i kept going back and forth from being really happy but suicidal. i was depressed and could feel it but i was also so happy. my doctor told me that i was going through a regular bipolar mood shift (mixed episode) while going through a lithium toxicity!!!! 4 1/2 years later im still on lithium, had a couple bumps in the road but still feel good and stable (managing) since. i hope this all makes sense lol but i understand you!!!!"

I also have bipolar disorder so I take lithium and vyvanse with it and when I was on anything higher it made me super manic and jittery. Very weird because 25 mg is perfect. A good 3-4 weeks to see how it works always helps me with new meds. Definitely keep track of any new symptoms or changes. I always thought it was corny and never did but with anxiety it definitely has helped me

emetophobia,fd7xjrn,t3_ek9xoi,1578211508.0,Do you feel like you have indegestion or acid reflux? I only ask because it’s technically a acid reducer heartburn relief medicine. It could help with stomach upset from that (that’s what I take it for) but it sounds like your looking for something more like pepto or a nausea relief medicine. But it doesn’t hurt to try since you said you ate something that didn’t agree with you. But for food poisoning relief I think you would feel better with pepto

I have dealt with serious paranoia, panic attacks and flashbacks ever since. Changed who I am completely. Keep in mind this was 3 years ago. 

I guess everyone’s different"
Anxiety,fan8ly5,t1_fakxtmr,1576229050.0,Needed to hear this. Had anxiety all day and just had a panic attack. Started with anxiety thoughts and worrying then my “stomach” to then the usual routine I do. Ugh it scares me so much I hate myself when I go through it I get depressed. Then afterwards I’m super tired like I had a hangover. I’m still trying to figure it out and everytime it happens no matter what I try to do it always finds its way back. Between anxiety and a fear of throwing up it’s been one hell of a ride. Thank you for reaching out it makes me feel less lonley and very less crazy much love to ya an definitely will reach out thank you
