Both are also true of my girlfriend and because of that I thought she would find a long, drawn-out description of what phonograph cartridges do and why they're so important for sound quality to be interesting (a big interest for me). Turns out she didn't."
Qult_Headquarters,fqjmojb,t1_fq7bgi4,1589412137.0,"I'm pretty sure all of the Qultists would be the type to be very into collecting guns and I wouldn't be surprised if they were armed to the teeth. Add in fanaticism/respect for Authoritarian leaders and an insane need to come out on top by being ""real"" Americans (not like whatever pejorative they're currently calling liberals), throwing in conspiracy paranoia combined with a very real pandemic and you have a potentially dangerous group if the virus gets worse and things REALLY start to go downhill. Hopefully it doesn't come to that."
ADHD,fqjkkv9,t3_giyrli,1589411267.0,Omg the people lucky enough NOT to have ADHD just don't understand no matter how many times we've explained and act as if you're being cheeky or perhaps putting them on just to be funny (even when I'm definitely NOT laughing) when we say sth is bothering us and that is SO frustrating!

Slayer,fq9pehb,t1_fq6m9ob,1589204230.0,Old school Metallica is really cool. I believe thrash metal started around 1982-1983 and Metallica and Slayer were there from the beginning. I would also recommend checking out Testament. Especially the albums New World Order and Souls of Black.
nin,fq7qkb0,t3_ggrzdt,1589150190.0,"Pretty Hate Machine, Fixed, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile. In that order. I think you're really gonna love it!

Coronavirus,fq17dln,t3_ggee4q,1589042780.0,Yeah and many countries around the world are relaxing restrictions now. That should be the response to Corona cases going down. But they're actually still going UP. So I don't know what they're basing this on.

The ironic thing is that the government has been much more level-headed about quarantining than the States."
Qult_Headquarters,fq03hrb,t3_gg829f,1589027245.0,Mass arrests AND public executions.

Qult_Headquarters,fpt41q3,t1_fpt339y,1588884493.0,"Dude I'm out of this. I've said my piece and it doesn't really matter if I believe it or not. If you want to believe that I can't stop you.

Qult_Headquarters,fpsz2if,t1_fpsuqgd,1588882047.0,"I could also write an email claiming to participate in ""spirit cooking"" but it doesn't mean that that's true or even a real thing. An email not backed up ANY corroborating/testable evidence is most certainly the very definition of hearsay. But I can see you don't understand the rules of logical inquiry and will believe whatever you want to believe and I've been more than clear WHY I call bullshit and any more clarification would be redundant.

Qult_Headquarters,fps67wq,t1_fps3mki,1588868148.0,"Interesting question. No I can't provide anything showing emails to be fabricated. But that doesn't mean I should take hearsay/speculation as the truth. As I mentioned before there is a lack of real, testable evidence.

Qult_Headquarters,fprgr3e,t1_fpqmtk4,1588853707.0,References to pizza and hotdogs are certainly not good evidence of any funny business. Furthermore there is no real evidence of the existence of adrenochrome as anything other than a chemical compound either. Nor am I comfortable assuming something exists without evidence. All you have is conjecture and rumours.

TrueAtheism,fpl8je9,t3_ge02bw,1588708256.0,I deconverted a few years ago and I've never had this fear. I became Atheist because I realized there was no good evidence for a god or gods.

I also have people in my life who are trying to understand but don't really. For example, I'm really proud of myself that I took out the recycling today and have showered three days in a row. But unfortunately I wouldn't expect anyone outside of this sub to REALLY understand.

Try the music listening. And it doesn't have to be soothing ambient music if you're not into that. I've mostly been listening to Slayer, Nine Inch Nails, and Faith No More. And sometimes Bj√∂rk.

One last thing. I know it must be difficult to read books now but I would recommend reading manga (Japanese comics). They have many, many, different types of stories and are generally a lot more mature than American comics. Anyway I find reading manga has been really soothing during this pandemic.
