(That being said there are guidelines on what type of flu vaccine you receive depending on age and whether or not you have any immunodeficiency or are pregnant)

First of all there are many different strains of flu. The vaccine just covers the ones that they predict will be the most prevalent/deadly. 

Second- it takes 2 weeks for the flu vaccine to become effective in your body. So you could have been exposed to the flu virus the day before you got the flu shot and it would cause you to be sick.

Third- it's not only about keeping you healthy. There are many people with immunodeficiency, people on chemo or other immunosuppressants, people allergic to vaccine components and babies too young to receive the vaccine that are depending on the people around them to not get them sick. 
(That goes for all types of vaccines!!!) 

So please, get your flu shot. And please vaccinate your children."
