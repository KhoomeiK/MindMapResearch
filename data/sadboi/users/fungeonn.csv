If my skin didnt any irritation i might introduces retinol in my skincare routine as i just hit 26 this year, gotta started using more antioxidant. I read retinol can be quite drying thats why i scared to use but i myself pretty much had solid skincare. So any product recommendation to a beginner like me?

Its is because we once go out on date in mall plus he said he said he wanted to buy some stuff, me being the person who knows too much stuff, leading him to here and there since the mall always be my hangout places so i know places. At the end of the date, he said oh i was too many just because i was leading him to places. You what legit makes me cry tears. Well hes stupid and selfish anyway, i dump him.

Well also to OP,  me as girl, i really dont mind any type of guy, as long he knows what he wants from me, knows his responsibilities, knows how to communicate not just ghosting if he had problem, not just promise lot of shit but doesnt do act. Its the matter of time, a person will just truly like you for you are <3"
