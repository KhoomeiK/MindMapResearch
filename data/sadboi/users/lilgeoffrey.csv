He struggled/struggles a LOT with sensory overload. He would have to cover his ears whenever he walked past a fire alarm (not one that's going off, literally one just sitting there on the wall/ceiling/whatever). The slightest hint of a siren miles away in the distance and he was on high alert asking about the alarm that often no one else even heard etc etc. Basically he processed sounds like on a massive scale compared to the norm and, as a child, that's really really scary!! Especially when no one else seems to experience them as intensely and are confused as to why you do.

Do you have over ear headphones that you could let him borrow to test out if that could help him? Dulling the sounds from the outside world could be really helpful and the pressure over his ears could have a soothing effect in him which could hopefully in turn lessen his anxiety.

Good luck, you sound like a wonderful big brother!"
