SuicideWatch,fdp9fdi,t3_emjsqj,1578623095.0,"Hey, I‚Äôm so proud of you for putting your shame out there. Guess what? There‚Äôs nothing virtuous about something that is intrinsically harmless. True virtue happens when someone has the ability to cause harm and chooses not to. 
It sounds like you have some mental illness going on. It can make you pretty fucked up, think fucked up things, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre evil. Evil people aren‚Äôt ashamed. Evil people don‚Äôt think about killing them selves to prevent harming others. 
I‚Äôm a survivor of a man who made the choice to act on his attraction to young children, just for context. I don‚Äôt say this lightly. 
Sounds to me like you need help, therapy, from someone who really knows what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs no shame to get help. It would be the bravest goddamn thing you‚Äôve ever done! Find a therapist who knows enough about the world not to be shocked or reject you for confiding these issues, and take the leap of faith. You‚Äôve already done it in a small way by posting this. People who help ppl like you are out there. I‚Äôm even friends with one of them! Human brains are fucking complicated. We don‚Äôt always have control over what we think or feel, but we can relearn. We can recover. It‚Äôs possible. And I believe in you."

SuicideWatch,fdp6zf1,t3_emgshh,1578621460.0,"I totally get that. But honestly, I didn‚Äôt have a clue what to do with my life either. And my life goal was magically winning the lottery so I‚Äôd never have to do anything. I‚Äôd been horribly depressed since my traumatic childhood. Totally lost soul. 
Moving wasn‚Äôt a picnic for me either, went through a horrible abusive relationship, mental breakdown, tons of self harm, suicidal and then legit homelessness. Sometimes I have no idea how I got through. BUT, here I am, doing something I love and am good at, making a living (not rich) and have a sense of self worth for the first time EVER. And I‚Äôm getting stronger every day. I just hate the thought that I almost gave up before I got here. I was that close. I‚Äôd hate to see you give up too. I‚Äôm 33f. If u ever need a safe non judgmental listener I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm happy to give u my cell #. Even if you just need someone to text and vent to now and then. 

Here‚Äôs my angle: I spend a little time on this subreddit and a few others every evening reaching out to people, because a few people along the way did it for me and it‚Äôs probably the reason I‚Äôm still here. Now I‚Äôm finally at a place in my life where I have something to offer back to the world, and it makes me feel good! Don‚Äôt know if any of this is helpful to you but it‚Äôs worth it to me to try. I‚Äôm still in pain myself at times, still lonely and hurting and depressed, but that‚Äôs what makes me a good listener: I know how it feels. 

Wish you the best, I really truly do. If I had more to offer I would!"
SuicideWatch,fdp5kn1,t3_emiwwe,1578620516.0,"I‚Äôm so glad! Thank YOU for letting me know it was helpful:) that literally made my day.

Honestly, I have scars ALL over my body. Some put there by me and some by nature. Some in my head and heart. Some still pain me to look at and are visible to the public. But here‚Äôs the thing: NOBODY LIVES A REAL LIFE AND GETS THROUGH UNSCATHED! My scars are my battle wounds. I am proud of them! I was wounded and survived! I‚Äôm a warrior! And now I‚Äôm stronger than EVER and lift other people up and my mere presence signals to everyone I meet that they can be themselves with me and trust me, because I‚Äôm authentic, genuine. You will be like that too, when you‚Äôre older, I can already tell! 

Stay strong my friend. This is only the beginning! Don‚Äôt worry so much about getting through life unscathed. Worry about being too afraid to get hurt to really live, really love. Life isn‚Äôt always glamorous. Sometimes bravely looks like just doing what you have to do day by day to achieve adulthood so you can strike out on your own and then BOOM! You‚Äôll find yourself doing cool things and meeting cool people who truly respect and understand you. 
A tough part of growing up is realizing ALL ADULTS, including parents, ARE JUST REGULAR PEOPLE, who often don‚Äôt have a clue what they‚Äôre doing or why. Take what your parents say with a grain of salt. I‚Äôve learned that even ppl who genuinely love you don‚Äôt always know what you need or get who you are, and that‚Äôs ok! You‚Äôll find your way, I promise, if you don‚Äôt give up on your self before you even get to the part where you‚Äôre really living. 

Always here if you need a safe listener. 
Good luck, fellow warrior. Borrow my hope until you find your own."
