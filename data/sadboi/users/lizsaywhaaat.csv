korea,f4touab,t1_f4talhd,1571791896.0,"Different for everyone. I grew up an hour away from New Orleans. Used to live in Korea (Gwangju), briefly Thailand, then in Paris for a while, but have lived in New Orleans for the past six years. While living in Korea had its pluses, it wasn’t the place for me. I moved here (NO) not expecting to stay for more than a year or two and then once again gtfo of Louisiana, but I’ve fallen in love with this place. Yeah, lots of things are fucked here, but the positives outweigh the negatives to me. The negatives outweighed the positives for me in Korea. Again, different strokes for different folks.

Edit: that being said, I shit on my hometown all the damn time."
