AskWomen,fr1qrvy,t3_gm5z1j,1589824358.0,"It’s bad if you think it’s a substitute for a personality. Niceness is a basic trait that many people should (and do) share. When it comes to a relationship, people are looking for actual things in common: do you share a sense of humor? Subjects of interest? Hobbies? Life goals? Lifestyles? Communication styles? Those are all things people are looking at when they’re seeking a partner. If you think just being nice should make up for a lack of all those things, you have a fundamental misunderstanding of relationships."

AskWomen,fqr2sh7,t3_gkh3wm,1589576520.0,"I guess I'm particular about the kinds of things I like, but I'm not discriminatory about it. I do really like to analyze stuff, but I think everything deserves to be appreciated in its own medium. Why would you want to shut yourself off from enjoying so many things?

Like, I grew up going to symphonies and operas with my parents and so I enjoy that classically ""high brow"" stuff as an adult. I have tastes about what I like and don't like in classical music and performances. But I also like all other genres including bubblegum pop. I think you can still tell the difference between good and bad bubblegum pop. So clearly it isn't like anyone can just put out a high quality, enjoyable, bubblegum pop song that will stand the test of time. There is skill involved, and that deserves appreciation. What makes one reality TV show more compelling than another? Why do some get cancelled after one season and others enjoy a long run and several spinoffs? There is something that makes good reality TV vs bad reality TV. 

Plus, so many cool works of art and brand new genres of things come out of mixing ""high"" and ""low"" culture. In fact, I think most things have tended to move from grassroots ""low"" culture into the ""high"" culture realm and end up getting snobby followings they never would have had decades earlier. It's all fluid anyway, and it's great to find things in common with all kinds of people."

My great grandparents came to the US back in 1910. My grandparents were born in Hawaii and Washington and my parents were born in Illinois and Missouri. My parents don’t speak Japanese and my grandparents spoke American English without an accent. 

The increase in Asian representation in media has been great, but I still wish we could also see families like mine because there are quite a few of us, and I think it helps to combat this “forever foreign” stereotype. There are many Asian families who have been in the US for over 100 years over multiple generations. Our stories are not always a struggle of old world vs new world and the immigrant experience. 

For example, an Italian-American family that has been in the US for just as long and has the same scant amount of Italian cultural influence is portrayed as totally American in a way Asian families often are not. 

Diane Nguyen from Bojack Horseman was the first time I saw a portrayal like that, and I really appreciated it."

AskWomen,fqgdxpd,t3_girorb,1589343823.0,"Ok, so I basically have an alcohol allergy and physically can’t drink. Back when I lived in the Midwest US, it was pretty difficult. Lots of socializing done over drinks, but I found more homebody friends who liked to do other things or found people more chill about me being sober. I also found friends in the church. Since I moved to California I realized that the Midwest just had a way bigger drinking culture.

Now I go do all kinds of activities with people: hiking, weekend trips to the beach, skiing, volunteer projects, nice restaurants, going out for bubble tea... I’ve joined some social meetup groups. 

Also, raves don’t have a lot of drinking. Everyone is on ecstasy, but I find rollers way easier to deal with than drunks. They’re just happy in a non-destructive way and nobody pushes you to do it with them. Nobody notices if you’re not on it. So I can go out and have a lot of fun dancing to music sober without being out of place at all.

None of my dates have ever cared. But actually, I love dating other Asian men for this reason. We all have alcohol intolerance so there’s a mutual understanding and no questions asked."

So people are living at home for longer because they have trouble affording anything else. They’re not settling down and taking on more classically “adult” lifestyles and responsibilities once they move out because they can’t really afford to anyway. Plus people are having to get more and more education in order to compete in the job market and so they’re not experiencing “real life” until later.

It’s just another natural consequence"

askwomenadvice,fpw593m,t3_gfwra4,1588957481.0,"Oh, and for basic conversation tips: compliments will go a long way. Complimenting people on basic stuff: I love your [thing]. Wow, you’re so good at X.

askwomenadvice,fpw4dws,t3_gfwra4,1588957054.0,"So my (grossly generalizing) theory is that a lot of female friendship culture is based on deep conversation (listening, sharing, supporting), vs a lot of male friendship culture which is based on doing activities together and making light conversation. So the barrier to entry for close female friendship seems intimidating to a lot of people, and a lot of men end up feeling emotionally isolated despite having friends or have trouble keeping contact with those friends when they can’t do activities together.

I think some women naturally tend towards the latter method of bonding and vice versa, which is why some men and women find themselves with more opposite gender friends.

If that’s working for you and you feel satisfied with it, I think there’s no need to change it. You can also try to find those women who are similar to you that way. But if you feel like you want to experience more of a stereotypical female friendship, I think you need to be prepared to make yourself more emotionally vulnerable than you’re used to.

I had to learn that it wasn’t until I made myself vulnerable to my friends (revealing my deeper thoughts, feelings, insecurities, and asking them for advice) that our friendship deepened. That can be scary, and shouldn’t be immediate. Make sure you spend enough time getting to know someone first to gage whether or not you can trust them that way. But if you start opening up little by little and get a positive response back, you’ll be on your way."

I think you can offset it with proper body language though. I think no matter what you look like, people respect competence and self-assuredness. 

I had to realize that I subconsciously turned in on myself and made myself appear smaller. So keep an open stance instead. Keep your back straight. Don’t cross your arms or clasp your hands. Maintain eye contact while speaking with people. When you gesture while speaking, gesture forward vs to the side or to yourself. Speak in a measured tone and if you have to pause to think, just pause silently vs using a filler word like “uh...”

AskWomen,fpszrf4,t3_gfdu5m,1588882390.0,"I’m not quite sure I understand what this is asking, but I’ll take a stab at it.

I often feel like femininity is a U-shaped curve as far as perceptions and reception. 

Like, if I don’t make myself pleasingly feminine to look at, I’m not going to be received as well. But if I’m *too* feminine, I won’t be taken seriously. Same with attractiveness in general. Not attractive enough and you’re looked over or ignored. Too attractive and nobody cares about anything else about you by comparison. 

So I feel like I have to strike a fine balance with appearing feminine, but not too feminine, and appearing cerebral but not too mousy.

AskWomen,fpseo3c,t3_gf7tcw,1588872198.0,"I think you’re not objectively examining this if you think that women are more likely to intertwine their lives with celebrities. You’re falling into the trap of discounting “celebrity culture” as something inherently feminine. Similar to “shit talking” vs “gossiping” when they’re the same thing, but one is characterized as a feminine trait and therefore more negative and frivolous. 

Pewdiepie is a celebrity and has an entire subreddit dedicated to him. So many men follow his personal and professional life, identify with him, admire him, check out products he endorses, have wishful fantasies about living his life... They watched his wedding video and commented on it like they knew him personally. That’s exactly what celebrity culture is.

Same with Joe Rogan. He has a similar fanboy following. Rappers have fanboy followings of people trying to copy their clothing style, or aspects lifestyle. Brett Favre, WWE wrestlers, and other sports players have many fanboys who follow their careers very closely and buy overpriced merchandise with their name, numbers, and face all over them. 

It’s not any different between men or women: You find someone whose skills you admire, personality you like, and/or traits you wish to emulate, and so you feel invested in them and find their life compelling. Men and women both do this, but we should examine the societal bias that treats male fanboying like it somehow doesn’t count."

And then once you’re in your position in government, you can only be punished for compromise and moderation because your district voter base will feel you betrayed their interests. You’re not doing what you promised to do once elected. 

Also, in-fighting is a distraction from actually facing issues. For example, “Why is it that heroin addicts get free methadone and I don’t get a free inhaler to save my life? That’s ridiculous! End free methadone handouts!”

When really it should be: “Why is it that ~~heroin addicts get free methadone and~~ I don’t get a free inhaler to save my life? That’s ridiculous! ~~End free methadone handouts!~~ Guarantee life-saving medications!”

Obon is meant to honor and commemorate the spirits of your ancestors and other passed loved ones. Part of what you do to observe it is visit family gravesites. So yes, there is a part that’s about festivities, but there’s still a certain weight to it because it is also a memorial. 

Cosplay is a pop culture practice that celebrates media fandom. It’s in a totally different realm. 

A comparison would be if someone from abroad dressed up as Wonder Woman to attend a Memorial Day commemoration ceremony and BBQ honoring WWII vets.

Can you argue that they’re somewhat related to each other and that the BBQ afterwards makes it a fun, social thing? Sure. Is it still clearly tone deaf and inappropriate? Of course it is.

So either you didn’t bother to do any research on the significance of the event out of respect for the traditions, or you did and you just didn’t care about how it would come across. Maybe you didn’t take it seriously, or your view of Japanese people as “others” made you unable to empathize with how these things might be received.

Simplified example: 

""Women like flowers. If I get an attractive woman flowers, she should feel appreciative and want to get to know me.""

Reality: Flowers are a gesture for special occasions or an expression of intimacy. You've never had any sort of personal conversation with your coworker Jane. You are a virtual stranger to her. Receiving random flowers from strangers is an inappropriate gesture. Furthermore, Jane doesn't even like flowers. You assumed she did just because she's a woman and you didn't bother to get to know her beyond that. Even if she did accept the flowers, she owes you nothing. It's not a token to exchange for the right to her attention. She has other things to do. She may not be interested in getting to know anyone. She may already be interested in someone else. Even if she was single and looking, maybe she likes guys who share her deep passions for aquascaping and chamber music, which isn't you and you don't even know about because, again, you don't know her.

AskWomen,fphruqm,t1_fph92nt,1588626660.0,"Right? The vast majority of my compliments come from other women. And it’s clear so many men are equating “women” with “conventionally attractive young women.” 

Also, how often are we criticized vs complimented by random strangers for the same reason: undue focus on our looks. 

“You look tired.” “Why don’t you smile more?” “Wow, you sure you want to eat that?” “Lol she has two mosquito bites on her chest” “What is she wearing?” “sweetie, are you watching your weight?” “Shame. She used to be hot” All those comments, all that “locker room talk”...

So many men go out of their way to criticize things about the way we look (hair color, hair style, makeup, clothing, nails, eyebrows...) with “Why do you like/do X if it’s not even attractive?” How many threads are dedicated to shitting on specific things about women’s appearances or aesthetics?  

People treat it like it’s their right to comment on how they feel about how you look all the time, a lot of times negative. We go out of our way to build other up *because* we’re constantly bombarded with criticism otherwise. 

We don’t have major battles with appearance insecurities because we’re getting showered with positive affirmations..."
AskWomen,fphqjy3,t1_fphqclo,1588625974.0,"Yeah. There’s a reason why women struggle so much with insecurity about our appearances. A lot of the messages we get actually aren’t positive, and it actually feels like we’re bombarded with criticism all the time, so that’s why we go out of our way to try to build each other up on the street."
AskWomen,fphq8i4,t1_fphpmx1,1588625812.0,"I think the other thing you have to consider is we also constantly get criticized for our looks and other behaviors by random strangers for the same reasons: undue focus on the way we look. Random people will tell you they don’t like the way your hair is, what you’re wearing, your tattoos, your lip color, how little or too much makeup you’re wearing, how big your chest is, how small your chest is, whether or not you’re smiling, how much or how little you’re eating. I’ve been in random restaurants and had some dude I didn’t know at the next table over be like, “Are you really going to eat that entire sandwich?” 

Even on Reddit, how many threads and comment chains do you see made around criticizing some aspect of women’s appearances? “What do women do that they think is attractive but not?” Answers like “too much makeup!” “Those thick eyebrows” “high-waisted pants” “those claw like nails” “neon dyed hair” 

People aren’t scrutinizing men’s appearances the same way. 

It’s not like we’re all constantly showered in positive affirmation."
AskWomen,fphpfgk,t1_fphomfe,1588625382.0,"You’re equating “women” with “conventionally attractive young women.” The average woman is not getting constantly complimented by men. And you said it yourself, men not complimenting men is still a huge problem, no?"
AskWomen,fphnym3,t1_fphmo0e,1588624632.0,"> The whole Crux of that issue is that women don't compliment men,

Why though? Every time this issue comes up, they just say “men don’t get compliments.” And why is that women’s responsibility to compliment random men? We compliment each other out in public. I get complimented by other women in my daily life, not men."

AskWomen,fp6v8lk,t3_gbna14,1588359169.0,"I don’t think we do. I think we’re more likely to see professionals where we get diagnoses and therefore help. Men in general are more likely to avoid seeing healthcare professionals, which is a factor in their shorter lifespans among other things. 

I also think depression in men manifests differently. I think women tend to turn it inward to a self-loathing, self-harm thing, but men project their feelings outwards and transmute their grief into anger and harm towards others more often. ...Which is why you see depression and suicidal thoughts in men turn them into school shooters and spree killers or woman-hating incels. It becomes a destructive force."
exredpill,fp6tv98,t1_fp4itwp,1588358499.0,"Do you think those things necessarily follow one another though? Because I feel like there are plenty of men who pursue success, are proud of the salary they earn and their career achievements, but have no problem loving, respecting, and appreciating a woman who makes less than they do. I really do feel the same in the reverse. 

My point is that the other way is so widely accepted, and frankly encouraged, to the point where those few men (because another I dated genuinely didn’t care) project that onto our situation. Granted, I was living in a more traditional part of the country at the time and now I’m in a much more progressive area where I don’t think this will be as much of an issue.

But do you think maybe you’re also seeing my account through that lens? Where there’s the automatic assumption I *must* have looked down on them simply because I made more and so you assume that’s what those men were reacting to vs us having the same dynamic many other couples have in the reverse? As in, a dynamic where you have a man who’s career driven and takes pride in his success, and  has a wife who earns less or even stays in the home, who he loves, respects, and appreciates just the same? 

It just felt like to me that the pitfall difference was that those women are often happy to be supportive of that, and don’t feel insecurity about it, but that isn’t often the case with men."
