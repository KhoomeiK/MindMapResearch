Theorizing is just a chore at this point ,always the same debates and always the same arguments, it's pretty much beating a dead horse and every time it seems like we're getting somewhere we hit a dead end .I'm convinced Scott has no idea what he's doing at this point ,it's why i dont care about this franchise that much anymore,Scott will just keep making more and more stuff up , the plot will increasingly become more and more convoluted and confusing and somehow he expects us to solve it,but it doesn't matter because we'll just eat anything Scott releases up because we're just desperate for some kind of closure. In conclusion this entire update was just lorebait and this series is going nowhere."
