Theorizing is just a chore at this point ,always the same debates and always the same arguments, it's pretty much beating a dead horse and every time it seems like we're getting somewhere we hit a dead end .I'm convinced Scott has no idea what he's doing at this point ,it's why i dont care about this franchise that much anymore,Scott will just keep making more and more stuff up , the plot will increasingly become more and more convoluted and confusing and somehow he expects us to solve it,but it doesn't matter because we'll just eat anything Scott releases up because we're just desperate for some kind of closure. In conclusion this entire update was just lorebait and this series is going nowhere."

Please fellow intuitives that specialize in ESFJese or just sensor language in general some feedback on my ESFJese skills would be much appreciated .I made sure i used short sentences because the sensor brain cannot comprehend  normal sophisticated intuitive language , i also used common sensor slang they're familiar with , i wrote  it all in caps and added what sensors call ""emojis"" for maximum sensory stimulation otherwise the sensor i'm attempting to communicate with will lose  interest in our conversation and will eventually leave  our communication exchange.
Truly fascinating creatures these sensors, however i do notice that this sensor in particular seems to display a more expansive vocabulary and  posesses a greater understanding of sentence structure  than most of its kind .I suggest we capture this specimen and study it ."
