PCOS,eyjixns,t1_eyhw1n9,1567120180.0,"I was dx at 19 but I was definitely having symptoms when I was a teenager. I wouldn’t get my periods for 3-6 months at times. My mom just said, “it’s because you’re fat, lose weight.” She didn’t care to take me to a doctor or have it questioned. I brought myself in at 19 bc I was having crazy hair loss so I went to dermatology. Dermo took labs and said my testosterone was high and then they sent me to an endocrinologist."
PCOS,eygu06c,t1_eyf2i56,1567076622.0,"PCOS is chronic and life long but it can be managed with diet and medication to alleviate symptoms. With the low carb thing, I would say spend 90%-95% of your time adhering to the diet. I occasionally cheat but when I do, I notice that I start to not feel well. You’ll notice over time certain things (cycles, hair growth, moods, weight) will fall into a more regular rhythm. I’m very sensitive to processed carbs foods so if I start eating “junk”, my weight shoots up, I’m moody and irritable, I don’t sleepy right, and my body hair starts to come in more."

PCOS,etfc2sy,t1_etedeqw,1562766114.0,I just bought inositol powder from Therologix ( spelling?). I also take metformin. Any tips for starting inositol? Side effects?

PCOS,etckzn9,t3_cb2awt,1562687130.0,No clue. I thought that about Metformin before bc it increases your body’s response to the insulin which will help you tolerate carbs better.
PCOS,esza0qc,t3_c9hizf,1562358010.0,"Don’t give up!! I was dx at 20 and I had 2 children one at 30 y/o and the other at 33! I needed a little help from clomid but it happened! 1st try with my 1st child and 3 tries with the 2nd child. No IVF, just more intensive monitoring of my hormones and cycle. Metformin might help you lose weight if they start you with that. I’ve also been hearing good things about a supplement called inositol (no personal experience with this) for weight management and insulin sensitivity. The diagnosis definitely sucks but it’s not hopeless.

Also when I was 1st dx I was 180 something. I was able to get to 153. Low carb diet worked best for me"

PCOS,eschpgq,t3_c71rzj,1561829764.0,Pregnancy hormones have to be higher on urine tests (25) than blood tests (5) to have a positive result. You can either go in for bloodwork or wait a few more days and retake a urine test with your 1st urine of the day. You could also have some of those symptoms bc your body is preparing for your period. I have PCOS and have had 4 pregnancies (2 live 2 miscarries) and never had a “false negative.” You can call the OBGYN and see what they would advise as well.
PCOS,escgs35,t3_c6pq87,1561829163.0,Good for you!
PCOS,esainy5,t1_es934dm,1561760527.0,"I 1st went through hair loss when I was 19 or 20 (I’ll be 34 in November). It’s what 1st  brought me into treatment and led to my diagnosis. I felt at the time, it Did get better over time but I did not get back all my hair. Fast forward to now: I just delivered my 2nd baby in November and in April my hair started coming out A LOT again and it hasn’t really stopped (my hair didn’t fall out with my 1st bc I went back on birth control and metformin as soon as I was able to) I went back on Metformin, and was started on Yaz and Spiroadalactone (this is my 1st time on Spiro). I took the Yaz for 2 months before starting Spiro bc it made me too sedated. I didn’t go back on medication right after delivery with my 2nd son bc I had my tubes taken out and my doctors were more of the “let’s wait and see what your symptoms are” approach. Since I’m starting from less hair now than I was when I was 19, I feel like it’s more noticeable and it’s even more distressing to me. I cry everyday and am embarrassed to leave the house. I will try to have hope that it will get better. Im seeing a PCOS specialist in August (that was the 1st available appointment) and I hope I can have a real, in-depth conversation about my concerns. I’m obviously not trying to get pregnant anymore, I just want to control my insulin resistance and hair loss. I should also note that I’m 30lbs lighter now than I was after my delivery with my 1st son (I’m anywhere bw 157-160)."
