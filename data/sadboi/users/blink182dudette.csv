We are all a group of mostly 18+, however all ages are welcome! (I have a 10 year old in my tribe and he's more useful than my 20 year old tribe mate 😅) 

We have a few solo tribes and a tribe chat is available for anyone wanting to team up. (Mine included, we are a Monty Python themed tribe, Knights of Camelot) 😊

A few friends have branched off into their own servers that we cluster with that includes a PvE server on Aberration, a PvP server on Valguero and another PvP server on Extinction. 

We're all (mostly) friendly people, with some resident assholes that are purely for entertainment on our discord page (yours truly ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) and we welcome any and all peeps... Assholes, friendlies, nerds, jocks, uggos, chonkers, gymrats(doubtful?), Muricans, Canadians, most Asians, all Germans, only 2 Irish though. We mostly would like people that have a broad sense of humor, since we like to joke a lot and don't want people getting offended unnecessarily. If you're sensitive, that's cool! Just know not one of us means any harm, we're mostly just being silly. 

We're not the kind of PvP map where you'll be constantly raided and we discourage the raiding of brand new tribes. We are not a super boosted server that makes the game super boring super fast. It can be grindy but... For the lazy/40+ hour work week peeps: I will be available to help as much as I can, whether it be for taming or breeding or supplies mostly. I'm garbage at building😊
