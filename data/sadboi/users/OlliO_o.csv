depression,fory6kf,t3_g952o7,1588020575.0,"Hi
I too have autism - asperger's - and depression. The problems coming with autism can cause and support depressions.
I am really happy to have two autistic friends which are alike me and do understand me.
That is my first recommendation for you. Try to find a autistic person, maybe threw the internet who shares your interest and also is capable to understand you and your problems.
What you can do now is trying to make a plan waht you want to do when.
A work plan really helped me, made me super productive and happier. I planed every minute. When I go on social media, when I learn for school, when do I read and when do I play music.
Furthermore you can try the usual recommended things as try something new which maybe will become a nice and fullfilling hobby or listen to really nice music. I wish you the best."
