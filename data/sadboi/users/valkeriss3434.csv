Be mindful that telling her she can‚Äôt text you more than 10 times a day is unproductive and will likely end in her crossing the line you‚Äôve set, leading to more frustration for you. A boundary would be more like ‚Äúif you text me me more than 10 times a day, I won‚Äôt answer until such and such time/when I can‚Äù. It sets out a clear expectation of ‚Äúif you do that, then I‚Äôll do this‚Äù. The goal is that she gets the message that her persistence and hovering won‚Äôt get her anywhere.

therapy,fbcdfs4,t3_eckp4w,1576721361.0,"Honestly, if your insurance covers therapy you are really better off visiting a therapist in person. Your insurance may cover it but you would have to check with your provider. Better help/Talkspace are better than nothing but if it‚Äôs feasible for you to visit in person, I would recommend you do that. 

I tried talkspace as a way to supplement my therapy when I was going through a really rough time and wanted to have access to a counsellor every day, and didn‚Äôt want to harass my actual therapist. For what I needed, it was really helpful. My talkspace therapist only communicated by voice message, so I could listen to his messages as many times as I wanted, and just listening to his voice was helpful. However, I think for more than that, it misses the mark a bit and feels much more hollow than therapy should. 

Good luck, fellow Canadian!"
