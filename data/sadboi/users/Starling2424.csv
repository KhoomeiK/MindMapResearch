AmItheAsshole,flxhb1n,t3_frnc84,1585582886.0,"NTA- I  actually asked my husband the exact same thing when we first met many years ago. I had a previous relationship with someone who was a severe alcoholic and I didn't want to make that mistake again. He said no and it didn't remotely bother me that he had alcohol in his apartment or that he would drink a beer with dinner. When I was asking about 'serious drinking' I meant someone who has an alcohol addiction. If your roommate was concerned about you having alcohol in the house or drinking alcohol in his presence he needed to state that before you signed a lease. However, that being said, you really don't want your roommate to relapse both because he sounds like he really wants to stay sober and admits that he has a problem and also because living with an addict is horrible. So, maybe could you compromise for the rest of your lease and use a locked cabinet or footlocker for your alcohol  and try to limit drinking to when he isn't around or make some kind of effort to give him a heads up if you are planning a dinner with a glass of wine. No, it is not your fault. You answered his question honestly and he should have been more explicit. But it is in the best interest for both of you that he stays sober. You really don't want to live with a relapsed alcoholic. After the lease is up then think about moving. 6 months isn't a super long time. I hope you can find a compromise that benefits both of you."

AmItheAsshole,fjk04fm,t3_fdrh0z,1583416935.0,NTA- It could have been handled in a number of different ways but most importantly you took firm and decisive action to let your son know that being a jerk to others is not acceptable.

The only redeeming thing about this story is that Mark's real friends called you out and told you to leave. Clearly you don't understand that it is none of your business why he gained weight. He owes you no explanation. You are an awful person. You don't deserve friends.
AmItheAsshole,fjgnp4m,t3_fd61b3,1583331459.0,NTA- that is your money and no one is entitled to it but you. Not even your family. If your dad thinks someone should give your sister $100.00 then he should. I have teenaged kids and I would never insist they give each other their savings.  That is ludicrous!

Not that people don't have alcohol- free weddings, but that is the choice of the bride and groom.  You could have addressed this conflict in so many ways that would have had a better outcome. Clearly she chose the vineyard after her dad was sober for 4 months. At what point in her life  will she be able to make choices that don't bend around her dad's addiction? Adult children of alcoholics spend their formative years having to tiptoe around their parents' drinking, I am sure she just didn't want to tiptoe around his sobriety too. 
At the very least, you should have gone."

migraine,ffw4k3v,t3_evawin,1580284038.0,"I have also had migraines since early childhood and they became chronic when I was in college back in the 90's. Even though I have spent roughly 65 percent of the last 30 years with a migraine, I still have managed to have a really fulfilling, meaningful, happy life. I have a wonderful spouse and great kids. I have good friends and lots of pets to snuggle. I take nothing for granted. I make the most of pain free time and try to live in the present rather than fret about the past or future.                                                                                                            My migraines won't kill me. Their pain is temporary. I don't feel bad for myself. So many people experience painful conditions with a poor long term prognosis. Migraines are annoying and disruptive  and painful and miserable, but they won't shorten my life, they don't  take away my vision or  the use of my limbs.                                                                                                                                         Trust me, when I was in my twenties I had plenty of times where I felt like you do now. But having migraines has taught me many things, like patience or the value of surrounding yourself with good people. I always look at what I can learn from every situation in life. Especially the challenging ones."
