I think the problem with Mirage is that he has a really weird kit, in low elo he is already busted, but as soon as you reach mid elo and above, he becomes useless since everyone knows how to counter him.

schizophrenia,fktxg0r,t1_fkttyci,1584537302.0,"Ok, it seems like I may not understand gaslighting comepletely, sorry english isn't my first language.

About the vlidation, I didn't mean to say you did it for validation, you were just aserting that you knew the exact reason that they post their memes, which you don't.

It also seems like you are drawing a line somewhere where you think you can objectively say what pain is valid and what isn't, again neither you nor I can dictate what isn't valid without objective proof or evidence.
And yours is just ""I have it worse, they have never felt ""real"" pain"".

And on that point I will repeat myself, I never said that the pain was equal, just that its just as valid. Which again, is two different things.

Also you can't joke about things you haven't experienced or understands comepletely? Thats just retarded.

And I see what you mean when you say the comment could be harmfull, but I will again repeat, thier pain isnt equal, just equally valid.
I just wanted to state that it makes no sense to try and run around telling others ""I have it worse than you, pity me"" it isn't productive in any way.

I hope you have a great day :)"

schizophrenia,fktlp1x,t1_fksvla3,1584525550.0,"Who are you to say whos pain is valid and whos isn't? I never said thier pain was equal to ours, I just said that it was just as valid. Equal and valid is two different things.

And as I said the my comment, their pain is relative to thier situation, thats how suffering works in humans, we compare everything to our own norms.
So if someone who usually have really good days suddenly have a day where they might not have slept as well as usual and they spill their coffee on themselves, they will feel as bad as when you have a worse day than normal.

Also, here comes a real shocker, memes are often jokes, made over exaggerated as the punchline.

By saying that someone can't have valid pain unless they have it as bad as you helps nothing and no one, plus I could do the same ""your pain is invalid because you have a roof over your head and food to eat, plus you also arent a slave, so that means you can't have valid pain"" do you see now how dumb that sounds? Just saying saying someone can't have valid pain becuase others have it worse is really dumb.

And isn't this post also a way to get social validation and attention?
Those two things are the cornerstones of social media, and that counts for reddit too. So everything here could be said that its for those reasons, or we could accept that some people are just here to make jokes and memes that makes others laugh.

Lastly, isn't it also gaslighting to tell people that thier pain is so much worse than others? In my eyes you just end up telling them that its a part of them and you can't get rid of it. If you don't think its gaslighting please explain to me how you would objectively calculate when pain is and isn't valid."
