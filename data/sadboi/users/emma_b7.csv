She can act when Ryan actually wants her to, but most of the characters that he’s written for her are almost the exact same. I loved her as Montana, so I hope that she is similar to that character in season 10 or her Netflix show (but not the same, because then it becomes boring and repetitive like we’ve seen the rest of her characters.) She’s super funny, so I don’t see why Ryan keeps making her play all these deadpan roles. I’ve been a fan of her since Scream Queens came out, and tbh I think that it’s all about whoever’s directing her. She’s amazing in Booksmart, and then when it comes to the Star Wars films she’s in, she’s the best in The Last Jedi.  If Ryan writes better roles for her and she grows as an actresss/adapts better to every director, I think she’ll become a fan favorite like Taissa or Emma"
