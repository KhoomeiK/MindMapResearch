BPD,flzoly4,t3_fs0mxw,1585628985.0,"I haven't been able to breath from how hard I've been crying these past few days. I feel so alone, so mad, so tired and broken. I want to be held but I have no one who will ever understand or even could/want to. I have nobody, my dad says its all in my head and that its a choice, my siblings don't want to hear it and I refuse to let anyone close enough to hurt me ever again. If my own father could abandon me when I needed him most why is anyone else any difderent. Every part of me hurts. So, yes we are alone but I completely understand and I'm sorry cus I know. I'm sorry that anyone has to go through any of this."

Ill be 27 in a few months and god im so exhausted. Its like I'm just existing. Moving cus I have to move. But some days its worth being alive. Even tho I spend most of my time in my room.

BPDsupport,flq74zq,t3_fj2788,1585381912.0,"Im new to reddit and no Im not ever sure either. At this point I've emotionally unattached myself from the idea of the, ""happily ever after."" And just keeping myself open to just have fun. Its not easy but its better than continuously being in and out of relationships that Im never sure about. If anyone has a better answer to this bs, im all ears."
