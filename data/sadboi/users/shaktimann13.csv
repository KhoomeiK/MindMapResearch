>As with many other aspects of Canadian federalism, creating a new national initiative for anti-money laundering is neither simple nor easy. Most corporate registration is a provincial matter, and the creation of a Canada-wide registry of beneficial ownership requires more than just changing a few federal rules. ‚ÄúIt is now the responsibility of the provinces and territories to introduce those requirements,‚Äù says Leslie. It‚Äôs up to each individual jurisdiction to ensure its own registry integrates seamlessly with those of all other provinces and territories‚Äîa process that will inevitably involve complications.   

‚Äù

>Even if Canada nails down how its beneficial ownership registry will work, a registry alone will not rectify Canada‚Äôs sagging reputation on corruption and transparency. More effort needs to be put into enforcing current laws, both to ensure bad actors are put away and to deter others."
