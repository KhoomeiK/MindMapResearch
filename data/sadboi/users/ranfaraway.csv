I had depression as a child and grief was filled with trauma but after I learnt acceptance and how to grieve properly I gained the skills needed to move on and to grieve in future circumstances such as the loss of my brother to cancer.

mentalhealth,fem9jhv,t3_epwrnz,1579244812.0,"It sounds like the real issue here is your parents and even to some extent your limited experiences. It seems like you misunderstand the responsibilities a school psychologist (or any psychologist) has to commit to when a child/student speaks about suicidal.    


A psychologist working with a child has to speak to their parents or guardians as soon as the child speaks about harming themselves or others this is to alert the parents/guardians to possible out come of having a child die due to self harm or suicide allow preventative actions to be taken.   


If that child dies due to self harm or suicide the psychologist treating said child can be held responsible for the death these psychologists who do not report when they are supposed to report can face legal sanctions.   


Your parents should have approached you with care and love, they should have sat you down and tried to understand what is going on with you and how to improve it. They should become actively involved in preventing these behaviours and encouraging self improvement.  


Since your parents are not supporting you in the appropriate ways and even if they were psychologists would still be your most favourable option when seeking mental health support and guidance towards creating a stronger more aware human being who can understand and live through life's rough patches.  


In my own case I had to trust psychologists, therapists, doctors, teachers, family members and friends from the age of seven to understand my mental health disorders (anxiety and paranoia disorder, manic depression disorders bipolar and ADHD) and how to live with them, it was only at the age of twenty four did I finally feel educated and strong enough to live life on my own.  


By that point I had many years of self harm, suicide attempts and emotional break downs and with each one learning new skills to prevent and control them. I still fight my disorders everyday and have learnt that you never stop working on your mental health. I got this far because I received professional help from the psychologists and proper medication from the doctors you are afraid of.  


Don't be afraid of the support that is out there a lot of people want you succeed and be happy. What you should fear is how much worse your life will be if you don't seek the help you need.
