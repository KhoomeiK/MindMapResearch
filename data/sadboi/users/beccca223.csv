BPD,fr2ceqy,t3_gm65st,1589834882.0,"Literally exactly the same, and then have the anxiety that I’m going to be weird at said event because I can’t get out my head. Which usually becomes a self for filling prophecy. In short I don’t make plans anymore, not in advance. I can only commit to things a couple of days before at most."

BPD,fomdakt,t3_g896vx,1587885918.0,"Absolutely, because my go to is to obsess over someone I try to hide it as much as possible. I check socials constantly and really struggle with not messaging back straight away. The only difference is I feel like I’m a little bit better at restraining myself, in order to not scare the other person away, however it could also be that I’m delusional and don’t have an accurate grasp on how I’m coming across. I haven’t had a serious relationship in over two years, so really it’s anyone’s guess."

At least there is the silver lining that soon I’ll spend a tonne of money I don’t have on some short lived hobby or interest, it might be something like fashion, make up, the gym, dating. 
I am currently receiving CBT so if I have any revelation on how the hell to break the cycle, I’ll let you know. In the meantime good luck and take care of yourself."
