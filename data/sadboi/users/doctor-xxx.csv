TheWeeknd,fl1fuqg,t1_fl1176d,1584728166.0,I think it’s a mix of conflicting emotions of being painfully heartbroken and regretful over his actions
TheWeeknd,fl10jix,t3_flx8kw,1584719609.0,"I also thought this was some sort of jab at Bella, maybe saying she’s a little basic, on top of him talking about typical vapid LA girls. She’s from Beverly Hills after all and her mom was on RHOBH...."
hiphopheads,fkmljc0,t3_fixpqb,1584332144.0,Is it working for everyone? Not working for me on both my phone and laptop..
governorsball,fk4ean1,t1_fk3smfg,1583858755.0,"Agreed. I feel like this all changes on a daily basis, no sense jumping gun just yet

Also seems like NY is doing a lot to try and control/contain it, probably being overly optimistic though lol"
LadyGaga,fjnt7gy,t3_fdg9st,1583513976.0,"I work with radio. It got added to 178 pop stations, and is set to debut at #23 this week! Then I think it closed out all of the stations on the softer pop format (HAC)!"
Music,fj4pqbj,t3_fbf339,1583013932.0,I swear I cry every time I hear this song
fatherjohnmisty,fj1dzo4,t1_fj04mmb,1582918099.0,Ooh I’ve never seen that! Is there a video anywhere??
fatherjohnmisty,fizmsjn,t1_fizmg3z,1582867267.0,Agreed!
LadyGaga,fizmrvg,t3_fafq4v,1582867251.0,We need this on Snapchat!!!
LadyGaga,firxnee,t1_fiqzr1v,1582673180.0,"She probably did, the leaked version has always felt like it was a demo that was close to being finished IMO"
Music,fir2b9q,t3_f9duxz,1582655959.0,One of my favorite songs of 2019 was your collaboration with post malone on his album. How did that come together and what was that process like?
LadyGaga,fipjyej,t1_fipizvf,1582609279.0,I would assume so
LadyGaga,fimc4bg,t3_f7cg9r,1582524617.0,"None of you are entitled to hear anything. Rihanna has been doing the same exact thing, teasing her next album,  for far longer, while working on fenty beauty and fenty savage and no one else is coming for her the way that people are coming for gaga"
LadyGaga,fhmr0y4,t3_f3vfsp,1581716876.0,"Probably bc Justin Bieber, tame impala, and a boogie with a hoodie all released their albums. Then there was the new Billie Eilish, new Sam Smith, new migos, new Kim Petras, etc. probably didn’t wanna compete with all those ppl even though they aren’t all in her genre"
governorsball,ffcsrq1,t3_er3cy4,1579806513.0,"I do VIP every year and it’s totally worth it. You have the best of both worlds bc there’s still a huge crowd of people so you can get that festival experience, but you can also take a step back and relax if you don’t want to deal with a crowd. Plus the people are usually way more chill. Nobody’s really pushing and shoving or getting obnoxiously rowdy. AND THE BATHROOMS"
governorsball,feldva4,t3_epmlkz,1579219866.0,I kinda see what you’re all saying but IMO I feel like last 2-3 lineups were the only ones that had such an overwhelming hip hop showing. All other past lineups were pretty alternative-leaning (kinda like this one)
governorsball,fek9env,t1_fek7uem,1579195348.0,Did you see her at the VMAs?
governorsball,fdba1zp,t3_ekgs4u,1578255350.0,Why does this look so accurate though?
governorsball,fc9hqka,t3_e5l1yp,1577552848.0,"I’m wondering if this makes sense. I saw a headline a week ago that Frank Ocean, Rage Against the Machine, and Travis Scott are all supposed to do Coachella. Also RHCP just reunited w/ John Frusciante. 

Frank is highly unlikely bc he’s Frank, BUT he did only do festivals to tour Blonde so you never know...

And then in terms of Rage and RHCP, I feel like it’s entirely plausible that one of these two could be there bc gov ball almost always has an older act headline...."
governorsball,fc9fytt,t1_fb8ce6f,1577552112.0,As in I worked at his label at the time
governorsball,fb8a33k,t1_fac7fz6,1576609431.0,"That’s not completely true. I have confirmed knowledge that last year’s clue with the cd that looked like Yeezus was actually tied to Kanye. He was supposed to do it but they wouldn’t let him have the stage he wanted, just like he did Coachella"
governorsball,fb885kd,t1_f9l30zj,1576608232.0,I read somewhere that she’s putting something out in spring
BPD,f6rid7c,t3_dssva7,1573105118.0,"I know the feeling, but, you are so loved! Your friends probably love you more than you even realize ♥️. Finding a group of people who are supportive like that is so hard but guess what, you’ve found that! Your identity isn’t grounded in your impulses. It’s grounded in your soul. I promise it will get better"
BPD,f5q78fw,t1_f5ov3yb,1572373522.0,Thank you so much ♥️
Kanye,f5q6f5q,t1_f5psjbe,1572373219.0,James Codon
BPD,f5icp7f,t1_f5dqmyb,1572213187.0,"I know what you mean, I’ve also had that if I’m in between prescriptions. Right now I’m tapering because it was making my mood swings even worse. And then I actually did that swab test (gene sight) which confirmed that I’d have an extreme adverse reaction to it"
BPD,f5icbu6,t3_dnpp8z,1572213040.0,Thank you so much everyone! Knowing I have this community of people who get it makes me feel so much less alone
BPD,f5ibsvo,t1_f5dpz86,1572212957.0,"Yea I’ve been tapering down from 20, then 15, now I’m on 10"
Kanye,f57n09k,t3_dmzzw4,1572039565.0,Absolutely beautiful. I think it shows his journey towards becoming more at peace with his demons
TameImpala,f50vvx4,t3_dmfwkh,1571933663.0,Ayyy it’s music connect !
BPD,f50vm9b,t1_f4zbcxk,1571933545.0,I read the same thing. I also have ADHD and I find sometimes the intensity of my emotions comes from being impulsive
BPD,f50uv2e,t3_d9fpyc,1571933220.0,"It’s so hard because you know that it’s so irrational but the emotions just feel so real. And nobody understands that, they just see this “crazy” person"

yeezys,evufj96,t3_cl8xke,1564793831.0,Anyone get their hands on 750s? That’s the real question...
Delaware,ete67zx,t3_c7vgae,1562723962.0,Getting a little technical here bc I do some production myself. The vocals don’t match with the sample/beat and also this clearly wasn’t mastered
fatherjohnmisty,ermrn7f,t1_ermr8bv,1561035081.0,Nah that’s fair. I’m also wondering if it was just maybe bc of where I was standing. Idk I felt like he kinda seemed depressed or like wasn’t really into the show
fatherjohnmisty,erhm3y1,t3_c15jr7,1560878021.0,Seeing the show tomorrow in Brooklyn. When it says on his site “w/ Jason isbell....” I’m assuming that mean Josh is coming out after Jason
