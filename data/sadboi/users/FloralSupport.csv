awakened,fj1g775,t3_d5708l,1582919400.0,"Damn this is some trippy shit. Funny that I just found your reddit page and ended up reading all your posts today, because yesterday I feel like I had a similar, less intense experience as your brother.

This whole week was the most peaceful I’ve ever felt. I was completely aware of everything my ego was doing, saying, and thinking. I was completely above it. It was bliss.

And then last night, I was sitting in my school’s dining commons with three friends, when I started tripping tf out. Of course I was very sober, but it really felt like I was on something. Everything was so clear. It felt like I was seeing things for the first time, like life was unfiltered after a lifetime of it being foggy and untrue. It was weird and terrifying, and it started to give me anxiety. I’m guessing I almost had ego death, but I wasn’t ready. It was my ego that was making me anxious (as that is always the case), because it was afraid of dying.

After it passed, that bliss from this whole week was gone. I think my ego freaked out too much, and since I gave into its fear, I’ve kind of regressed a bit in my state of awareness. But it’s fine. I wasn’t ready to be completely aware and present. It’s scary shit. I think I’ll get there someday, but for now I’m just tryna vibe. I just started college and I don’t wanna spend all my time here fixated on “becoming enlightened.”

And now here I am reading your first reddit post that weirdly relates to yesterday’s experience. I was trying to find similar stories last night, but I couldn’t find any. So thanks for posting this like 6 months ago!"

spirituality,fiyyldc,t1_fiyqtll,1582849962.0,"Oh sweet, I’m from the bay too! Small world lol.

I think you’re thinking that you have to silence your ego and tell it to be quiet. Correct me if I’m wrong. If I’m not though, it might be helpful for you to know that these actions aren’t exactly productive in a sense, because you’re just using your ego to try and quiet the ego; that just results in an extremely conflicted state with lots of confusion and possible self deprecation. I was in this state for many months. Just simply being aware of your ego with no judgement is the route to peacefulness. But of course, that’s only if you’re ready for it. You can go at your own pace and that is perfectly okay.

I have to say, I agree with the gma. Again, what you’re doing is using the ego to reflect on the ego, which leads to the question of who is really reflecting on the ego’s reflection, if that makes any sense. You cannot *truly* learn about the ego until you step outside of it, at least a little. You have the illusion of learning by reflecting, when you’re still in a totally egoic state. Again, I want to repeat that you should do what you’re truly comfortable with, but also beware that it’s the ego’s natural state to stay exactly where it is. It’s afraid of changing or dying, and that may be what you’re listening to.

You’re totally right about the effort thing. I’ve realized these last couple days that it takes a conscious and constant effort to be aware; it doesn’t just naturally happen when you’re ready. Maybe that’s the case for some, but not for me (at least on some level). I’ve been very aware of my thoughts and I think they are slowly but surely changing. This is definitely helped by meditation.

This is just my perspective, but I don’t think the ego is ever *ready* for a higher level of consciousness. Like I said, it wants to stay exactly where it is. It doesn’t like change, and it’s comfortable with where it’s always been. You say you shouldn’t force yourself to meditate, but I believe that you *have* to force yourself. You’re forcing your ego to change, since it will always resist. That’s its nature.

I used to chase the highs of my ego until I realized that it completely sets myself up for the lows. I used to think the key to everything was to not believe my ego’s negativity, but I would still go along with its positivity. Now I’ve realized that none of these moments or thoughts can be trusted; they are all impermanent. Even when my elated ego tells me that I should pursue higher states of consciousness, it can’t be believed. This realization helped me become more grounded in the present moment.

All this is coming from a very spiritual place, so if you truly aren’t ready to leave the ego, then that’s totally fine. These are just my thoughts on the whole life experience :)"
spirituality,fixslwb,t1_fivb262,1582826021.0,"Interesting how shrooms did nothing for you. It did absolutely everything for me the first and only time I took them, from showing me what a higher level of consciousness feels like to showing me the terrifying ways my ego has been treating me. I started meditating the very next day and knew I had shit to fix/heal.

I’m not sure if in the present, I’m wanting to smoke some weed. Yes, of course part of me wants to. But another part of me wants to enter high levels of sober consciousness. My ego’s got some conflict going on and I’m not exactly sure how to solve it.

I really love how you’re able to not force yourself into anything and stay within your ego when you know what’s beyond that. It’s not your time, and that makes sense. Maybe I should learn from you and simply learn from experience while I’m this young. At the same time, though, I don’t think I can go back down. My ego is clearly filled with thoughts of anxiety, self depreciation, and depression. I can’t live with it anymore, as I let it completely control me for the first 18 years of my life. It’s scary, debilitating, and I would hate to be back there after seeing it for what it truly is: meaningless thought. I don’t know, though, maybe those thoughts can be changed.

And yes, meditation is definitely the practice that’s been helping me transcend my thoughts. It’s finally freeing me of constant anxiety and it’s so so peaceful. It’s a shift in consciousness that’s only happened quite recently, which is what guided me to make this post in the first place.

I’ll definitely try smoking again when the time is right. Part of me does want to, and I won’t deny that or shut it down. Then I’ll reflect on how it felt. You’re right to say that living by experience is the correct “flow.”

Thanks, man. This really helped a lot. I’d love to visit New Zealand lol you don’t even know. One of my two dream destinations right there. Or you could come to California, we have nice weed. Peace ✌🏼"
spirituality,fiwmq64,t1_fiw7vio,1582792687.0,"A main point to this post was to articulate how a spiritual awakening made me actually *dislike* the use of drugs and quit for a while, so that is not exactly true. I have begun a spiritual journey, and there’s no denying that from my perspective.

You cannot know what someone else is going through; it is completely subjective. Be careful with comments like these. They can be very destructive to some. It could make them question themselves and everything they have gone through when there is simply no need for that.

Petioles,fgz2s58,t3_f0smmq,1581190058.0,"I used to smoke every night as well, but after I took shrooms I realized how much I had been suppressing all my anxiety/depression. And it wasn’t just because of the weed, it was because a lot of things and I had been doing it my whole life. After that trip, I actually kept smoking but it would make me anxious every time. I was painfully aware of all my issues especially when I smoked weed. Then I took acid and realized I actually need to be active about my issues. That’s what led me to taking a 7 month t-break.

I’m nearly 3 months in right now, and this break is extremely relieving. The first month or so was really difficult, but it’s honestly smooth sailing from here. I don’t have cravings anymore and I can sleep at night with no problem (and I had insomnia before I even started smoking).

I’ve replaced smoking with meditation, walking, singing, driving, music, writing, etc. There’s so much more for me to do now. Being productive instead of smoking every night really feels better in the long run.

Since I can’t numb my pain anymore, I have to face my negative thoughts/emotions head on. Sometimes it’s absolutely terrible, but it’s much needed. Everything I feel is temporary, and *will* pass; I just have to get through it and let myself feel it.

I suggest you take an extended t-break to just deal with your shit. And maybe go to therapy, take some anxiety meds, or something like that to help you get through it. If you stick with it, an extended t-break really feels like a breath of fresh air."
