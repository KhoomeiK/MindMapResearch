ptsd,eri0g9v,t1_eri06m2,1560886832.0,"CBD oil can come from many different plants such as evergreen trees, that's the fortunate news if marijuana is still illegal. So if you ever want to try CBD oil (I mix mine in food when in raw form) try looking for CBD that isnt sourced from Marijuana :)"
ptsd,erhy15f,t1_erhxm3n,1560885356.0,"Well, marijuana is statewide legal where I live for both rec and med. I am not sure if pure CBD oil turns up on drug screening or not. I'll have to look into that. Concentrates with THC will show.

We have laws customized for every business, some businesses here dont care if you use it, long as you dont do it on the job. Some jobs require a doctors note, while other still discriminate against marijuana users. Check with your state and company laws."
ptsd,erhwtzm,t1_erhwj94,1560884603.0,"I do live with family that doesnt quite understand :( 

Yes my medications have helped a lot, but CBD oil and other cannabis concentrates have reduced my flash backs. However, I havent had a bad trigger in almost a year, so I guess it all depends on if someone is going to trigger me.

I understand feeling failed by the mental health system, and I am sorry you feel that pain too. We get swept to the side in ER visits, even if the ER visits are because of physical issues. Our world needs to reform the mental health system big time."
ptsd,erhv0li,t1_erhuqvd,1560883482.0,"Yes I do have a therapist, taking medications and using medical cannabis concentrates. 

I also have the problem that it's family that doesnt understand or they ""gate keep"" saying people have it worse than me, but I think every person with any kind of illness, physical or mental experiences gatekeeping. 

It is a good idea to walk away as soon as you can, but sometimes walking away will make the person triggering you even angrier, but it would be like taking cover for an earthquake, get away as quick as possible, even if there is a possibility of getting hurt :)"
ptsd,erhfq37,t3_c1p29o,1560874352.0,"My family says my life wasnt as bad as theirs so I have no excuse. You know yourself, you know your diagnosis and you should believe yourself over anyone."
