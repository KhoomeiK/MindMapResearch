bipolar,fbf82ce,t1_fba0vei,1576804012.0,I am not entirely sure tbh. I started lamictal and adderall at the same time and did not notice increased anxiety.

So I really think adderall decreased most of my anxiety? Hopefully that helps haha

Your situation is very different though, and I think if you can‚Äôt wait until those feelings pass (and they might not) you might need to remove this person from your life again.

Just keep an eye out for any of your mania warning signs, and if you recognize one, let your doc know ASAP. If you start to become manic try to get the Effexor dose lowered, lamictal raised, or both.

Relax as best you can, be yourself, try to focus on her and the rest of the environment more than yourself.  Have a good time, try to relax, and she‚Äôll have a good time too! Changes the hypothetical pity to being happy she said yes! We are very critical of ourselves. Often we think we are much more awkward or weird than others think we are. If you pay less attention to yourself, you will be less likely to notice ever tiny mistake you make. Even if others notice these mistakes or think you did something awkward, that‚Äôs just it. One awkward thing you did, it over, they forget about it. Every single person is weird and does awkward things sometimes. Because of this, I don‚Äôt think she said yes out of pity. 
Also, as someone who is 4 years out of high school, I can say you will eventually realize you are far too critical of yourself, and wayyy more people like you than you think right now."

zen,eyhi056,t3_cvpwdu,1567087503.0,"A very influential book for me was ‚ÄúNovice to Master: An Ongoing Lesson in the Extent of My Own Stupidity‚Äù by Soko Morinaga. This is a spiritual autobiography where he describes his encounters with death, what led him to Zen Buddhism, and his years of training as a monk. He includes parts of talks he gave and the ways he helped his students, as well as the ways he was taught by many people. 

It‚Äôs short and not too difficult to read. It‚Äôs not like jumping straight in to things it would be impossible to grasp on your own. He quotes a few koans and well-known stories and touches on explanations while showing how his understanding of them impacted his practice. 

I believe the ebook is $10 on Apple Books. The physical version is about $16 new, but a couple years ago I bought a used copy for $7."

bipolar,eyfhj3j,t3_cwuz3w,1567048896.0,"Step 1: pause. Take a deep breath. You will make it work and figure it out. 

Step 2: get a planner/agenda. One class at a time, go through the syllabus or schedule and write in all the due dates. Color code if you want, by class or assignment type. Don‚Äôt think about what you have to do for the assignments, that‚Äôs not important right now. All you have to worry about is writing the right things on the right days.

Step 3: when you get your work schedule, write that in your planner too. With classes and work in your planner you can see where you have time for meals, homework, and social/relaxation time.

I like to get a planner that has hours in the day. That way I have a visual representation of time bc it‚Äôs hard for me to understand how much time I have to do things. I also write my meals in my planner, when I will work on specific assignments, and every time I make plans with someone because my memory is garbage, especially with the stress of work and school. I know I‚Äôm saying it like it‚Äôs easy, but I still fuck up a lot and forget to write things or don‚Äôt stick to it. But it still helps a little as long as I‚Äôm not hard on myself about not sticking to my schedule. I hope it can help you too, though I‚Äôm not sure how similar your struggle with anxiety is to mine. 

You don‚Äôt need to counteract the anxiety or numbness. Accept it and let it go. If it don‚Äôt go, it don‚Äôt go, but it will eventually with time, no matter what your brain is telling you now. You can be anxious and numb and still do what you have to do. The most crippling thing about it is thinking that you have to stop being anxious before you can do things. Courage is being afraid and doing something anyway, and anxiety is a little bit like fear. Anxiety and the physical stress response give you a lot of energy. Maybe you can learn to use that energy however you want, not however your anxiety wants."

I‚Äôm not sure how to handle memories that are already made, but for ones you will make I find that consistent mindfulness meditation (whatever kind, even for just a few minutes and a few times a week) helps me be more present.
