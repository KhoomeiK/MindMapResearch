suggestmeabook,fna1wzq,t3_g0dnto,1586789431.0,"""Under a Dancing Star"" - *Laura Wood* (historical fiction, but way more goofy warm romance than kingdoms or any royal finery)

""Lord of the Butterflies"" *- Andrea Gibson* (poetry. beautiful, heartbreaking, poetry)

These are both wonderful and heartfelt reads I find myself coming back to."

BisexualTeens,fmrl918,t1_fmq3j1q,1586326689.0,Rosa & Holt's friendship is iconic ngl
books,fmkkrlg,t1_fmiyds4,1586158382.0,"yes, exactly! I honestly got so annoyed every time the siblings dismissed him. the amount of trauma all of them have been through is just a whole other level tbh. it would just be so good to see them work through that and heal together.
and both my favorite ships (Dave/Klaus and Diego/Eudora) end w one of them dying, and it's just like bad things happening to them one after the other."
Grishaverse,fmk74kj,t1_fmix4z3,1586146260.0,"ah yes, he meant the girl she was before. and see! this is one of the parts which makes it clear that the loss of Alina's powers was the loss of a huge part of her."
books,fmk6j9l,t1_fmjh8re,1586145818.0,"it came out in October last year and it's her first adult dark fantasy.
if you loved six of crows, this will definitely be a wonderful read."
books,fmixet3,t1_fmiv1r0,1586118845.0,"Yes, exactly! From the moment Reginald inflicted ""tough love"" on him to this brutal end of his and Dave's story, Klaus has been through so much. And I feel like the siblings (except Diego ig) don't take him seriously that often, dismissing him as the junkie brother, but he's always always there for them (the way he stood up for Vanya as soon as he saw her locked in and all but saved the day w Ben's help). I really want for Klaus to have a peaceful ending, but oh well, chances of that happening are pretty low. Dave was a beautiful part of his life, perhaps maybe the best, and I'd love for him to have something at least mildly as good as that again."
Grishaverse,fmiwvau,t1_fmipyfw,1586118538.0,"Yes and it's only natural that if the Darkling is returning as the ""enemy"", Nikolai and Zoya might seek out Alina"
Grishaverse,fmiwo2g,t1_fmiskwi,1586118423.0,"So, I really like the Darkling as a character, he's flawed but he has the i-had-a-screwed-up-lonely-past thing going for him. But I kinda really liked the ending he got in Ruin and Rising. It seemed sort of poetic, peaceful and final in the way he asks Alina to say his real name one last time. It reminds you of his humanity beneath all the cruelty. Plus, I'm pretty sure he'll be villainized once again in King of Scars 2 and I really don't want that because it would spoil his ending."
books,fmis6h1,t1_fmirlvc,1586115831.0,"Agreed. Like, he's determined to becoming sober in god knows how long just so he can talk to Dave (also, Diego's sincere attempts at helping him were just so endearing). And the sheer fact that he stayed in Vietnam and quite literally fought a war just so he could stay with the love of his life is so wholesome and adorable."
books,fmir1nd,t1_fmiqtl5,1586115177.0,"Yes! And did you notice that when Klaus finally contacts Reginald, and they're in the barber's shop or whatever, the mantel has Dave's portrait along with all the siblings. If that isn't foreshadowing something, I don't know what is."

books,fmiqeof,t1_fmioqcl,1586114804.0,"ngl, that is so very disappointing. but I'm just glad that the show's writers had the sense to see the potential in their story. because it's extremely powerful in the way it changes and impacts Klaus as an individual (also, yes, Dave* sorry, just realised i wrote David)"
Grishaverse,fmiq14l,t1_fmionx6,1586114581.0,"Yes, exactly. I've been thinking of all sorts of plots which could change her ending. I feel like her powers were a huge part of who she was and her development as a character."
YAlit,fmipi7a,t1_fmiojgm,1586114276.0,I second that! I was so so disappointed in wayward son.
books,fmiohyv,t1_fmino6r,1586113692.0,"wait hold on, Klaus isn't explicitly mlm in the comics!?? but that's just. 
Klaus and David were such a wholesome couple! I can't imagine them not being a part of the original plot. I do hope they get more screen time in s2 though, like in flashbacks maybe."
