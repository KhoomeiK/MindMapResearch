bikesgonewild,ff22siy,t3_epyxnd,1579492250.0,I was thinking about upgrading to a fz1 tbh. It looks like a reasonable upgrade from the fz6r and make for an awesome sport tourer bike

WeirdWheels,fbpu9ap,t3_edzvdj,1577025125.0,I would take this over the electric mustang any day of the week
depression,fbfnpve,t3_eczhm3,1576815297.0,"It sounds like you know what the right thing to do is. If my family tell me that, I‚Äôll just grab my keys and head to the hospital. No one is going to tell me to abandon my friend if they‚Äôre not going to show some empathy. Points added if you tell them to eat shit and stop being a group of grinches."

motorcycles,f0a8v1l,t1_f09olr5,1568511949.0,The bike is theirs. Slipping the clutch does help but transitioning from a manual car to a bike was kinda weird. I guess the car felt more natural since I‚Äôve been driving a manual for a while but flicking the wrist is a weird motion for me :P
Jeep,ezmam61,t1_ezm9lmb,1567989250.0,The black accents on the grill actually help keep bugs from splattering all over my radiator lol. The lights are a pair of pro comps and do a fantastic job lighting up a dark road.
Jeep,ezm7pom,t3_d1j4yj,1567987865.0,Nice tires! Those are my favorite style for the Jeep!
depression,ezgts86,t3_d11e1j,1567901388.0,I‚Äôm wish I knew what to say. I hope your peace helps guide where ever you go Lolly. I don‚Äôt know you but life shouldn‚Äôt be taken granted for.

friendship,eyv23m0,t3_cyuqfr,1567478398.0,Well make it one way or another. It‚Äôs just another process of life!
friendship,eyutgam,t1_eyuroue,1567471690.0,"Yea, she asked how long I may take but I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure. She really did mean a lot to me, I helped take her to the hospital when her ex refused to do it and remembered the nights where we shared our feelings about random stuff. Deep down I know I would do a lot for her and she would be the same way which makes it hurt more. I‚Äôll try and say what‚Äôs up maybe within a few months to half a year but in terms of meeting someone like her again, that may be pretty difficult. Wish you the best of luck, god speed to you!"
friendship,eyukjz6,t1_eyubuv7,1567464650.0,I just finished talking to her and told her that I couldn‚Äôt be in her life right now just as friends. I really appreciated her honesty and I guess I just reciprocated it back. A part of me feels alleviated that I did it but another part of me is still wondering if it was the right thing to go through with. My anxiety whenever I think about her is slowly vanishing though
depression,eyduxsa,t3_cwodng,1567025057.0,Same here. I‚Äôm honestly just sitting around trying to distract myself from another wave of anxiety.
depression,eyc3dcl,t1_ey9o5u1,1566995918.0,I honestly want to give that a try. Maybe it‚Äôll keep my mind from wondering into negative thoughts. What genre was yours based off of?
depression,ey7vgal,t1_ey6n2om,1566902407.0,"As of recently, I catch myself trying to go back home as late as I can just so that I don‚Äôt go bored and start wandering in my own thoughts. Work is a pretty productive solution but have you considered another outing? Maybe, like volunteer work or speed dating for shits and giggles?"
depression,ey5rsoc,t1_ey5p261,1566838831.0,"Tbh, I have a lot of trouble over analyzing too. I catch myself doing that or getting close to it every time I make a minor mistake at work or even with that girl. It can be dangerous running around in circles within your own thought without an objective. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what does your thoughts lead you to?"
depression,ey5mhh2,t1_ey5lhzt,1566835247.0,"To add to your comment, try to keep a journal with whatever thoughts you have during the time and just write it all down. I know this sounds like a cliche suggestion but being able to track your mental health throughout a period of time can definitely help with getting an idea of progression. I‚Äôve been doing it for the past week and caught myself commenting about how I can get better (if that makes sense). The person that knows you the best is yourself. I know that I feel in love with this girl but after reading some of my previous remarks, it may be more based off the idea of not being alone than compatibility. Hope you get to see our advice OP. Godspeed my guy."
