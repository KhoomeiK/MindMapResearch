Works better than wine

I went to the mountains

I wrote some songs
But they were shitty as hell
Only works when I'm broken
Four inches from dying
And at my best

You head to the country
For a minute or two
And lie on the earth
And for better or worse

There was one place I worked for, a brewery for years. They would take my advice because it was just a few employees and I was the main bartender. Regret moving away from that job because it's so rare.
