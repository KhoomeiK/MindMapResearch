As for me, I love playing as Riku all thru out the game so his part is easier for me.

The things you should remember are:

Grind a bit more if you feel like you’re under leveled but if not frick the boss up.

Maximize your decks since you have 3 Decks each for every character.

Have a deck with skills that are effective on normal nightmares (like graviza/ga + Thundaga * Balloonra + Sparkga etc) be creative like you’re creating a combo.

Have a deck for Magic only attack mostly Balloonra (I usually use this deck for some boss fights)

Have deck for potions and drop-me-not/never. (Just because lmao) JK do whatever you want with the last deck.

Also don’t forget to update your abilities (like your guard, high jump etc.) make sure they’re up to the latest one.

Anyway I’d say don’t bother too much on grinding for level if you’re not too underleveled. Just go straight to the boss. that’s what I did and it worked."

I'm sure they too are experiencing hardships of their own.

Also, remember that you and your friends are there to help each other. They may not know exactly the pain you're going thru but it doesn't mean they can't understand.

I hope you could restore your relationship with your friends. If you want to the best thing you could do is talk to them. Apologize that you've been an asshole. Tell them that you were a mess, and been easily irritated these past months/weeks. Own up to what you've done wrong but never ever point fingers at them that they should have done this or that.  Just apologize genuinely and it should work.

You could do this in person, over text or group chat.

The thing is, you guys are 13 years old kids. All of you are too young to understand how these emotions work. How everything work. You're friends are always joking around because they're kids. That's what kids do the difference between you and them is that you've been in a shocking and difficult situation that forces you to become more sensitive emotionally and there is nothing we can do about that.

FinalFantasy,f8uceqa,t3_e1kwb2,1574825243.0,"Overview:

Unlike with normal leveling RPG, FFX uses Sphere Grid to increase a Character's skills and Stats so basically when you check the sphere grid the characters start off at different parts on the grid (if you zoom out you'll see where everyone is positioned) in the simplified Grid which is the original version every character is positioned in the grid where they have their own specialties ex. Lulu starts off in the grid where most black magic are located aside from that the Sphere Grid also give stats increase. E.g. Magic slot increases your magic.


There are also level spheres (1,2,3...) Which are use to unlock new areas in the Grid. Basically to enter a different part of the grid e.g. Tidus wants to learn Lulu's you'll need a level sphere. 


Farming:

You can farm for spheres from enemies in different ways like using an ability from a character e.g. Power/Speed/Ability Extract but some monsters naturally drop them and later in the game you can buy weapons that you could use to extract spheres.

For the first part I suggest you should place your Sphere Points wherever you can since it's pretty linear at that point so you can get the feel of it eventually you'll see them gaining new skills and an increase on their stats.

Tip:

Tho some would say that you could farm AP later I'll still suggest that you start a battle with characters you don't mainly use then change to your main party so everyone can get Exp."

Advice,f849dec,t1_f84515b,1574236548.0,"Don't give me the no sense of humor or imagination redditors BS. Obviously we wouldn't know if it's humor or not why would we think it's a joke? People here ask for advice for different things. (Relationships, Drug abuse etc.) They get to the point and tell us what's wrong not like you tell us something and when we react you tell us that ""It was suppose to grab your attention"" it was humor lol."
Advice,f823ixp,t3_dylgl9,1574183207.0,What does the contract says? Is there a particular reason on why you want to quit? It would be best to have a back up job before resigning because it could hurt your resume.
Advice,f822s6h,t3_dykgyl,1574182753.0,"My parents were like that too (typical Asian parents *insert ""You a doctor yet? meme""). I think it would be best to be honest with them don't give excuses instead tell them your plans on how you could improve your grades and show them results."
Advice,f7yxmu1,t3_dy264r,1574102244.0,"What concerns me is that your children are already watching porn on that age. It would be better to limit and manage what websites your kids could access.

Do you have any idea on how they found out about porn? I think that would be the first thing you should investigate and from there you could explain it to them that there are things kids aren't suppose to do.

I'm sorry I don't mean anything bad but frankly asking for advice for a talk about choice of pornography to a 7 year old kid rather than asking for an advice on how to explain to a child they are too young to watch porn is very concerning."

Anxiety,f7r3ci1,t3_dxj14z,1573974099.0,"You're already doing great! Just remember that you don't have to tell the therapist anything that could make you uncomfortable if you aren't ready. Don't put too much pressure on yourself, you're not doing it for anyone so don't think you need to do it fast just take one step at a time."
