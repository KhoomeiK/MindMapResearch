relationships,f9dcn5g,t3_e40amy,1575232243.0,"Hi, I was your girlfriend in this situation once- I was really struggling to deal with some anxiety issues, and was finding it really difficult to put emotional energy into a relationship even though I genuinely liked the guy. I ended up breaking it off for the same reason.

I think, take some time yourself to grieve, and after that, if you care about her a lot, keep on checking how she‚Äôs doing every 2 weeks or so with NO PRESSURE TOWARDS DATING. Ask her to get a cup of coffee with you or go for a walk or whatever with NO PRESSURE.

When I was depressed, I felt like no one valued me as just a person- the only people who valued me were guys who were romantically interested. Having some totally platonic, low key support, would have helped me a lot üòä

I think this is the best way to approach it. Wait for her to bring up starting a relationship again on her own- if she doesnt after a certain period of time you‚Äôve personally decided on, start accepting its not going to happen. But don‚Äôt ask her if she wants to re-evaluate after a pre-defined period- thats just more pressure for her right now."
relationships,f9d3msr,t3_e49x4w,1575229889.0,"I‚Äôm 28(F) and had been dating a guy who was older than me (41), who has 2 kids from a previous marriage. He‚Äôs from another country as well, but has a green card and his kids were born in the US. We both have PhDs and work together in the same company.

I also got a shit ton of negative reaction from my family- being older and having kids translated to ‚Äúhe‚Äôs taking advantage of you with his life experience‚Äù to them. He‚Äôs also Muslim, which freaked out the conservative members of my family (unfortunately). 

I kind of understand your BF‚Äôs situation. One of my friends in grad school was a lady my age who moved to the US from Burma, leaving her daughter behind. She worked as a janitor in the US and sent the money to her daughter. It‚Äôs a real situation some people are in. It shouldn‚Äôt translate to ‚Äúdeadbeat‚Äù.

I think the most important questions here are:
- how is your relationship? Do you have a lot in common and have fun together? Or do you end up talking about logistical issues with the difficult situation most of the time?
- is he emotionally stable and treating you well? The guy I was dating ended up having some emotional issues from his divorce that made him behave very weirdly with me. I was not expecting this and they came at a time when I was already struggling to defend our relationship.
- What‚Äôs the plan with the kids? Will they move here? Will he move back and want you to move as well? 

When I started dating a guy with kids, I assumed they might hate me, and was nervous about that- but actually that was like the least of the problems. We always got along really well. The bigger issue was his divorce, and emotional stability, which ended up really tanking things."

I was dating my partner for about a year, he had a lot of patterns that seemed consistent with BPD. We also broke up after a series of intense emotionally abusive incidents that seemed to come out of nowhere. 

We were separated for 2 months and now are trying to work things out. He‚Äôs been seeing a therapist who seems to be helping a lot. The therapist is avoiding diagnosing my partner with anything- instead he seems to mainly guide him toward strategies to communicate his feelings with me.

PM me if you want to talk, its kind of a long, complicated clusterfuck. I‚Äôm currently overwhelmed and confused, but hopeful."

We had another fight where he threatened to break my neck, which was apparently also my fault for not understanding him.

Logically I know his behavior is bad, but emotionally I feel like I must be an awful unloveable person if someone I thought cared for me would treat me this way.

AskReddit,f2eo4vo,t1_f2e4xfy,1570200304.0,"I had the same thing with my ex boyfriend- we broke up because when he would feel bad about himself for any reason, he would have rage attacks about some small thing, which escalated to him yelling at me that I‚Äôm a slut / stupid / terrible for him.

After we broke up he told me he‚Äôd go to therapy, as I‚Äôd been suggesting for some time. Then he told me that at his second session the therapist told him that he‚Äôs a great guy who‚Äôs working hard and has pretty much cured himself already anyway. And that I should take him back or else the therapy program will definitely not succeed.

When that didn‚Äôt work he told me he won‚Äôt go to therapy anymore unless I agree to come back. He sent me a text that literally said ‚ÄúNo dating, no therapy‚Äù.

AskReddit,f06hgup,t1_f05scp6,1568437977.0,"Hi... I‚Äôm 29 (actually today is my birthday) and just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. This guy told me he loved me more than anything, and did small things every day to show that- bringing me tea, talking about our plans for the future, watching movies I liked together, giving me costco pajamas etc. 

Then if something minor made him feel bad about himself, or not important, whether it was related to me or not, he would fly into a crazy rage where he would yell, call me a slut, tell me he never cared about me, tell me to go fuck other guys, etc.

It was crazy. I never thought I‚Äôd be a person to tolerate that kind of stuff, but I‚Äôve also never been with someone I felt so loved by and connected to... apart for the part where he told me I was worthless (approximately once a month). I had tried to convince him to get therapy ages ago when it began, but he insisted either 1) his feelings were justified, because he‚Äôs an emotional person / he got triggered from something that reminded him of his past ex, or 2) we just needed to move on and pretend it didnt happen.

I don‚Äôt know what my point is with this, except that it was the most bizarre experience, and you‚Äôre a very strong person for getting out. I finally left my person after he really crossed a line, and I still miss him a lot. Now he‚Äôs apparently ‚Äúrealized he really hurt me‚Äù and is going to therapy- but I dont understand how someone could have demonstrated so much love for me early on could have not realized he was hurting me when I was crying and telling him ‚Äúhey you are hurting me‚Äù.

Now I‚Äôm scared there‚Äôs something about me that is just unloveable, or something that provokes people I get close to to start thinking they dont need to treat me with any basic respect..."
stepparents,ezkamns,t3_d19l7a,1567957570.0,"I had a similar experience- I‚Äôm 28F and my boyfriend was 41M with two daughters, who were 8 and 12 when we met. 

Our relationship didn‚Äôt work out, which I‚Äôm still really sad about, but it was mostly due to my ex‚Äôs untreated depression, and his difficulty with not projecting his relationship issues from his ex wife onto me, not anything about the age difference or kids. We dated for about a year.

I met his kids the first time when we were friends but not yet dating. We went to a high school football game together. After we started dating and he let them know (which was REALLY soon, about 2 months later), our first meeting was me coming over for dinner and us watching a movie together. His logic with having me meet them early was that it would help us all grow to get to know each other gradually, rather than him forcing in a very serious, established SO when we would be close to being ready to get married. I actually think this worked really well, because the three of us bonded a lot.

I agree with the ‚Äúfun uncle‚Äù or ‚Äúfun aunt‚Äù kind of thing. I did zero real discipline. I mostly hung out with them as an adult friend who cared about them a lot and wanted to do fun things with their whole family together. I helped the younger daughter with her homework and picked her up from after school daycare 1 day a week, and helped my ex prepare dinner every day, which helped me stay in the adult category while being a friend. And my ex was great about emphasizing to them that I cared about all three of them, which was great since I kind of struggle with expressing feelings. The 8 year old was really close to me, then went through about a 3 month period where she pushed me away, and then became really close to me again after I picked her up at school one day when she was sick and both of her bio parents were not available.

Sorry this was long! With the age difference thing, I think it‚Äôs not really a relationship issue- I felt really close to my ex, more than I have to people my age that I‚Äôve dated. But it can be weird being a millenial suddenly thrust into a ‚Äúparental figure of a 13 year old‚Äù position. My mom was very upset about my relationship. Also, although my ex looked very young (I thought he was 35 when we met), when we went to his daughters‚Äô band concerts the other parents looked so old to me :D

The other thing was that my ex was married to his ex wife for 14 years. Allegedly they started having problems in the first year, but their first daughter was born quickly and they tried to stick it out. He initiated the divorce so he thought he‚Äôd be fine afterwards, but he kind of projected weird stuff onto me- for example, if his ex wife used to criticize him about his kind of control freak cleaning habits, he would get really defensively aggressive with me expecting me to have a problem as well, even though i hadnt said anything and honestly don‚Äôt give a fuck how he cleans stuff. Our relationship was amazing at first, but this stuff tore it apart- so my advice is *make sure he‚Äôs really moved on* and isn‚Äôt going to hold you responsible for his ex‚Äôs actions.

Also it *really really sucks* to break up after you start to feel like you‚Äôre part of a family with children. I still miss them a lot and feel like they‚Äôre still out there all three having a great time together, and I‚Äôm pretty much alone."
BPD,eya089j,t3_cvq5ho,1566956095.0,"My boyfriend / ex boyfriend seems to have bpd, and this sounds like what he tells me- what he describes is:

1. He goes over the top trying to be the perfect partner for me (which he really does)
2. Everything is awesome!
3. I have an off day (stress at work or with my family etc) and seem kind of quietly down, or slip up not doing something he believes he would have done for me if our roles were reversed (phrasing something in a weird way, not doing a household chore etc).
4. He feels bad about himself because if I‚Äôm slipping up it can only be because he‚Äôs failing at the relationship
5. He decides to ‚Äúshow me what a terrible person he is‚Äù by flipping out and yelling abuse at me
6. I cry and leave
7. 48 hours later, heartfelt apology, he seems genuinely shocked by what happened, revert to step 1.

It‚Äôs hard because after our last incident, he has been going to therapy, but the therapist is just telling him generic things like ‚Äútake deep breaths when you‚Äôre angry‚Äù which I feel is really missing the depth of the situation.

AskReddit,eu3ry8u,t1_eu2d59u,1563423433.0,"I think I‚Äôm in that situation right now- I love my ex a lot and really care about him, but ended it recently as he was becoming seriously emotionally unstable.

I went back to the city I grew up in over the 4th of July weekend to visit some friends, and he became convinced that me being in the city would remind me of my previous ex boyfriend (who I havent seen in years) and lead to me breaking up with him. So he refused to communicate with me at all via text, phone, anything, while I was on my trip. When I tried to reassure him that I wasn‚Äôt planning to leave him, he flipped out and yelled at me to stay in Texas forever : / 

It sounds silly but really shook me up. And unfortunately this is the 5th or 6th similar incident of exploding over imagined fear of abandonment.

Also some of the stuff he has said to ne feels borderline emotionally abusive.

And on the other hand, he also really dramatically expresses love- when he‚Äôs feeling ‚Äúup‚Äù he treats me better than anyone else I‚Äôve ever dated. At those times he‚Äôs really considerate and loving, and feels like he automatically knows how I‚Äôm feeling and is really in sync with me.

Some people have less / different immediate symptoms than others even if they all have celiacs, so some people might appear to tolerate non-GF oats better.

stepparents,eruivoy,t3_c3dpuc,1561282510.0,"Hey... I‚Äôm 28(F) dating a guy who‚Äôs 41(M) with two daughters, SD13 and SD9 for about a year. 

I was kind of freaked out when we started dating more by the concept of the situation than actual events. I‚Äôm not really old enough to be SD13‚Äôs parent, and going from thinking of myself as ‚Äúsingle millennial person‚Äù to ‚Äúpotential step mom to preteens‚Äù gave me kind of an identity crisis. I was also really worried that they‚Äôd hate me. Then after I became attached to them I started worrying about scenarios like ‚ÄúBM decides to move to another state, taking SKs etc‚Äù and ‚ÄúSD9 freaks out if SO and I actually get married‚Äù etc. I can be kind of an overthinker. People (including strangers?) also keep ‚Äúhelpfully‚Äù telling me things like ‚Äúyou know you‚Äôll always come second to his kids‚Äù which is not really helpful.

As someone with no kids, what helped for me is that my SO (and their BM when they‚Äôre with them, I assume) is clearly their parent. SO handles dinner, laundry, cleaning, packing lunches, and parenting instructions. The only ‚Äújob‚Äù I have is homework help with SD9 and picking them up from school / daycare. I think this has helped a lot with both me not feeling shoved into a role I‚Äôm not ready for, and them not feeling like I‚Äôm trying to replace a parent / like they need to resent me. It also helps that their parents had what sounds like an awful time in their marriage, and especially SD13 has expressed relief at the decrease in tension compared to when their parents were together. 

SD9 has had some issues with feeling like I might be taking more of their dad‚Äôs affection. She would do stuff like yell at us not to kiss (like quickly kissing when I left or arrived, nothing inappropriate) and tell her dad that her dad wasnt allowed to ride a bike with me unless SD9 was their because biking was their thing. What helped was me spending more time with SD9 individually so she thinks of me more of ‚Äúanother adult who cares about SD9‚Äù rather than ‚Äúsomeone competing with SD9 for time with SO‚Äù if that makes sense. This was probably the hardest thing for me to deal with because I felt excluded and had a hard time not taking it personally. Sometimes reading posts on this sub saying things like ‚Äústepparents are always outsiders, especially ones without kids‚Äù made this feeling worse... however I also got some good advice and reassurance that many 9 year olds do this from this sub :)

The other big issue we have is that my SO struggles with depression, which gets worse when SKs are with their mom. 

How old is your SK? I feel like it might actually be more difficult with a younger child, although clearly I don‚Äôt know. My friends with biological children (infants) all look absolutely exhausted. Do you feel like you‚Äôre losing yourself because of the sudden amount of time spent on childcare? Would you feel comfortable telling your SO something like ‚Äúon tuesday/thursday I will be doing [activity] after work / in the evening, so I won‚Äôt be back til 9 pm‚Äù or something along those lines? Maybe actively scheduling time for yourself outside the house will help you feel more like yourself if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre missing out on?"

Some examples are ""my mom likes to listen to lots of music"" (from SD9) and ""my mom did X when she was in high school"" (from SD13). I usually say something like ""oh, that's interesting"" or ""your mom sounds cool"".

They used to go on a lot of vacations when their parents were together, and I don't really like hearing ""remember how much fun it was when you and mom and us did X in Spain"", but I'm ok with sucking it up.

However if they said anything that came off as ""we wish mom was here instead of echopotato"" or even ""we wish mom and dad were still together"" I'd feel really awful. .

I think it might be helpful for OP to her SO that she doesn't mind them talking about their mom generally, but she'd appreciate if her SO could talk to them about some specific questions /statements that are especially hurtful to her.

My SO also doesn't discourage them from talking about me to their mom, which I know SD9 does (apparently stuff along the lines of ""echopotato has a really cute cat""). I think my SO is actually happy that they're demonstrating to her that they like me.

Another caveat, SO and their BM did not seem to hide their relationship issues well at all when they were together, which I think plays a huge role in their acceptance of me."
AskReddit,erk1ozq,t1_eriw89d,1560953137.0,"I‚Äôm 28 and broke up with my long term boyfriend about a year ago, around all the time all my friends decided to get married and/or have a baby.

I know it was the right decision, but I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I‚Äôd really like to have kids, but seem to have one difficult relationship after another. 

And yeah, I know, in that case I should take a hard look at myself and how I‚Äôm contributing to it.... but I just don‚Äôt know. All the guys I‚Äôve dated start criticizing me quite a bit about a year in (stuff like how I drive, how I wash dishes, weird food habits, etc). It feels like my issue must be being super annoying to live with. 

I have my shit together professionally, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anyone cares about that."
AskReddit,erk0scl,t1_erjmy42,1560952475.0,"I feel like this- I‚Äôm 28 and just finished my PhD. I have a job as a research scientist that‚Äôs nice, but I don‚Äôt have the same passionate focus on it that I had on my grad school research, and some of my coworkers annoy me a lot. I also had to move for my job, so I‚Äôm in a different city than all of my friends (who are in my grad school city) and family (who live in my hometown). The guy I was dating for 2 years (and living with) didn‚Äôt want to move with me immediately, and I was so upset by this that I abruptly broke up with him right after I moved. And now I feel like I don‚Äôt have anything in common with the version of me from 1 year ago, which is super disorienting.

I kind of realized that I really defined myself by my PhD topic and my friends. Now I‚Äôm not sure who I am or what I should be doing, and I feel kind of sad to have lost all that certainty.... even though theoretically, getting a job and moving was what I wanted."
stepparents,erh3x9o,t1_ercz500,1560866516.0,"I am worried about the FAFSA.... SO and I work together so when we get married the total income will double. His older daughter is 13.

I was only able to go to college because my parents made so little (only my dad was working, as a teacher) that the FAFSA helped us out a lot. I suspect that if our incomes are added FAFSA will give us nothing, and I know that SO has no idea about this stuff (he‚Äôs not from the US). 

Will their BM still be required to pay something? She‚Äôs the custodial parent and has a job, but we‚Äôd be the higher earning household. We split time with kids 50/50... custodial just means that she gets to make medical decisions in this case."
stepparents,erh1z00,t1_eregdrz,1560865030.0,"Hey, thanks  :) It‚Äôs fine that it‚Äôs not advice, it just helps to talk about it a little bit and hear that other people have been in similar situations. 

I love my SO and want to stay with him. I also want him to be happy, because he deserves to be, and because I love him. My sister had depression in college, so do I know not to say dumb well meaning things like ‚Äúhave you tried being happier‚Äù... I think with my SO, his depression comes out as him saying me and his kids would be better off without him around since he can‚Äôt keep us happy.... which makes me feel guilty and like I need to fix it.

I think I probably need to look for some therapy for myself even if my SO wont go"
stepparents,ered9rn,t1_er57ou0,1560781109.0,"This sounds like my SO... he hasn‚Äôt been diagnosed (because he won‚Äôt see a therapist...) but he has something like depression, and gets really strong feelings that nobody wants him around, and that he‚Äôd be better off ‚Äújust disappearing‚Äù.

He hides it around his kids, but usually either doesn‚Äôt or can‚Äôt hide it around me on the weeks we don‚Äôt have them. I also think his kids not being there contributes to making it worse.

I also have a really difficult time feeling like it‚Äôs not me! And I understand that he‚Äôs going through a lot of shit, but it‚Äôs not good if we can‚Äôt be happy together when we‚Äôre alone, right?

He told me that it helps if I‚Äôm just there hanging out with him saying nothing when he‚Äôs sad. My first impulse is to keep poking him asking him what‚Äôs wrong all the time, which i‚Äôve been told does not help :) I can do this... but I‚Äôd like to do fun things with him also?

Would you have any advice for how to approach this with him? He‚Äôs from a country where therapy is less mainstream than the US and thinks it‚Äôs ‚Äúfor crazy people‚Äù and that he is just a person who has a lot of mood swings. When I‚Äôve tried to suggest he should go because of the effect this has on me, he feels criticized and like I‚Äôm unhappy in our relationship, and gets more depressed :("
AskReddit,er5mc4m,t1_er3ymuh,1560528981.0,"This is really hard for me- I‚Äôm a woman, I have a PhD in electrical engineering, and work as a research scientist. I‚Äôm the only woman in the group I work in. 

Our manager, who‚Äôs maybe 50, always makes sure I get a chance to talk during meetings, but when I‚Äôm alone with the three other guys my age (~30) they cut me off constantly when I talk, and disregard my suggestions, even though my PhD is directly in the area that we work in, and theirs are not. I tried bringing it up with one of them, and he told me it just happens naturally because my sentences are too long : | 

They are condescending and terrible and I hate going to work with them. It makes me want to leave the group, even though I was so lucky to get this position in the first place.

Also just to note- most of the other men and ladies I work on other projects with are perfectly fine, and we all give each other feedback pretty equally. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with these guys particularly."

stepparents,eq0t3sw,t1_eptjwm1,1559693628.0,"So this kind of happened again today... we all went out to get icecream. I told my SO ‚Äúhey, take your sunglasses off‚Äù (in a nice way). SD9 immediately said ‚Äúno, dad, keep them on!‚Äù and then kept saying ‚Äúwhy wont you put them back onnnnnn‚Äù after he took them off.

Another example. Yesterday I reminded their SO to drink water. SD9 said ‚Äúmy dad drinks enough water! Don‚Äôt tell him what to do!‚Äù

Both times my SO just tells her to relax, and then tries to give her extra attention later. I am kind of lost with how to handle this part. I know she‚Äôs going through a lot, and I should be the mature one here, but it‚Äôs tough having a kid trying to give ‚Äúsubtle‚Äù hints that you shouldn‚Äôt be there all the time. Honestly if she was like this when her dad and I started dating it would have been what I expected, and would have bothered me less- I think it feels worse because it randomly started up 8 months in."

All 3 of them are incredibly awesome, but it‚Äôs kind of weird explaining to people when everyone else my age is following the same basic school / job / first marriage / baby path. I always thought I wasn‚Äôt the kind of person to care what people think, but it‚Äôs kind of disconcerting to be on a totally different track. 

I also feel like I dodged a bullet a little bit though... kids seem more fun to hang out with than infants from what I can tell"

And thanks! We don‚Äôt live together, but I hang out at their apartment a lot. My main ‚Äúparenty‚Äù role is helping SD9 do her homework (maybe that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs pushing me out... hmm...)"
stepparents,eptjiem,t3_bvy87r,1559491508.0,"SD9 does this. She didn‚Äôt used to, when I first met her she was actually pretty demanding of attention from me. About 3 months ago she started this thing of pushing herself between me and her dad all the time. Yesterday she actually tried pushing me away with her feet so I couldn‚Äôt sit next to her dad while we were all watching a movie. She did this while she was laying on her dad‚Äôs lap, so it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre sitting together and making her sit alone in a corner facing a wall or something

It‚Äôs annoying, and makes me feel rejected. SO and I both notice it and don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs happening. He tried talking to her about how i‚Äôm not here to replace either him or her mom, and she said she knows, but it didnt help.

She also gets equally jealous when her dad spends any time with her older sister SD13, and tries to push herself between them as well.

I kind of wrote it off as her being annoying / hopefully some kind of phase (does that sound really mean?). I get all the time with my SO on the weeks that they‚Äôre not here (theyre one on, one off) so I just make up for it then.

Note- theyre not actually my SDs, SO and I have been dating for about a year."
AskReddit,ep7c5v9,t1_ep6vlan,1559079935.0,"Oh, yeah, so question about this. I adopted my cat while I was in Texas, and the vet scared the crap out of me about making sure to give my cat the heartworm medicine on time. I was very convinced she would definitely get heartworm and die if I missed a dose.

Now we live in Oregon. Is it still super important here? She‚Äôs an indoor cat. I‚Äôll probably still keep giving it to her regardless, so I guess I‚Äôm just curious?

By the way, in Oregon it is not legally required to get your pet vaccinated for rabies. Or to get your brakes inspected yearly. It‚Äôs illegal to signal another car to pass you, though."
AskReddit,eosrvqh,t1_eokoo9r,1558828200.0,"Oh no, that sounds really frustrating, and him moving to be with you probably adds some feeling of pressure that it ‚Äúneeds to‚Äù work out for him. 

The job thing sounds like it would be the biggest stressor- have you tried setting some kind of hard deadline for him, or talking to him seriously about how it‚Äôs a problem? Sorry if these are really obvious questions, I‚Äôm just wondering how that goes when you‚Äôve discussed it. I know with my boyfriend, he really shuts down if he feels criticized at all (and starts just excessively criticizing himself rather than listening) so i think the challenge would be bringing up how it‚Äôs absolutely critical that he gets a job and builds his own life in your city without sounding like you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwhy havent you done this yet‚Äù. Maybe try reassuring him that you know he‚Äôs totally capable of doing this, and that you‚Äôll be really proud of him for going to the interview and giving it a shot?

My boyfriend looks fine outwardly- we actually met at work, and only a few of his closest coworkers and friends have picked up that he‚Äôs struggling. He hides it really well from most people. He has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions, which leads to sudden depression, sudden talking about how he‚Äôs worthless, or a couple of times sudden anger - but the anger‚Äôs more like ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre going to leave me anyway, so go on and leave‚Äù than anything about a specific issue. It gets worse when he‚Äôs tired, and absolutely terrible when he‚Äôs jet lagged. But he maintains his apartment really well, helps his family with their issues, helps me with my issues, and tries really hard to keep everything running smoothly even when he‚Äôs mentally on the edge.

But, I‚Äôm sure other people have told you, if the situation is getting out of control, you need to end it for your own sanity. He moved there with you, but he can always move back or start his own life wherever he wants if the relationship ends. Maintaining his life should be his own responsibility first, it‚Äôs going to be too much for you to handle everything for 2 people."
