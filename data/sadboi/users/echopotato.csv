relationships,f9dcn5g,t3_e40amy,1575232243.0,"Hi, I was your girlfriend in this situation once- I was really struggling to deal with some anxiety issues, and was finding it really difficult to put emotional energy into a relationship even though I genuinely liked the guy. I ended up breaking it off for the same reason.

I think, take some time yourself to grieve, and after that, if you care about her a lot, keep on checking how she’s doing every 2 weeks or so with NO PRESSURE TOWARDS DATING. Ask her to get a cup of coffee with you or go for a walk or whatever with NO PRESSURE.

When I was depressed, I felt like no one valued me as just a person- the only people who valued me were guys who were romantically interested. Having some totally platonic, low key support, would have helped me a lot 😊

I think this is the best way to approach it. Wait for her to bring up starting a relationship again on her own- if she doesnt after a certain period of time you’ve personally decided on, start accepting its not going to happen. But don’t ask her if she wants to re-evaluate after a pre-defined period- thats just more pressure for her right now."
relationships,f9d3msr,t3_e49x4w,1575229889.0,"I’m 28(F) and had been dating a guy who was older than me (41), who has 2 kids from a previous marriage. He’s from another country as well, but has a green card and his kids were born in the US. We both have PhDs and work together in the same company.

I also got a shit ton of negative reaction from my family- being older and having kids translated to “he’s taking advantage of you with his life experience” to them. He’s also Muslim, which freaked out the conservative members of my family (unfortunately). 

I kind of understand your BF’s situation. One of my friends in grad school was a lady my age who moved to the US from Burma, leaving her daughter behind. She worked as a janitor in the US and sent the money to her daughter. It’s a real situation some people are in. It shouldn’t translate to “deadbeat”.

I think the most important questions here are:
- how is your relationship? Do you have a lot in common and have fun together? Or do you end up talking about logistical issues with the difficult situation most of the time?
- is he emotionally stable and treating you well? The guy I was dating ended up having some emotional issues from his divorce that made him behave very weirdly with me. I was not expecting this and they came at a time when I was already struggling to defend our relationship.
- What’s the plan with the kids? Will they move here? Will he move back and want you to move as well? 

When I started dating a guy with kids, I assumed they might hate me, and was nervous about that- but actually that was like the least of the problems. We always got along really well. The bigger issue was his divorce, and emotional stability, which ended up really tanking things."
BPDSOFFA,f8rnazl,t3_dunjr3,1574745539.0,"Hey, I was in a very similar situation recently. 

I was dating my partner for about a year, he had a lot of patterns that seemed consistent with BPD. We also broke up after a series of intense emotionally abusive incidents that seemed to come out of nowhere. 

We were separated for 2 months and now are trying to work things out. He’s been seeing a therapist who seems to be helping a lot. The therapist is avoiding diagnosing my partner with anything- instead he seems to mainly guide him toward strategies to communicate his feelings with me.

PM me if you want to talk, its kind of a long, complicated clusterfuck. I’m currently overwhelmed and confused, but hopeful."

AskReddit,f303on5,t1_f2zwqgn,1570545688.0,"I’m really struggling with this now. My ex was like this- for example, we had a fight where he called me a slut, which escalating into a bigger fight because I “wasn’t getting over it fast enough” and it was making him feel bad. We had another fight where he threatened to break my neck, which was apparently also my fault for not understanding him.

Logically I know his behavior is bad, but emotionally I feel like I must be an awful unloveable person if someone I thought cared for me would treat me this way.

Do you have any advice on how to get past this stage? I started seeing a therapist, and at least he’s an ex now, but I can’t figure out how to stop feeling terrible"
AskReddit,f2eo4vo,t1_f2e4xfy,1570200304.0,"I had the same thing with my ex boyfriend- we broke up because when he would feel bad about himself for any reason, he would have rage attacks about some small thing, which escalated to him yelling at me that I’m a slut / stupid / terrible for him. I couldn’t make him understand that this was an issue for me- he’d say stuff like “sure I make mistakes but you don’t get that I’m a human trying my best” or “if you loved me you’d make some small effort to understand”.

After we broke up he told me he’d go to therapy, as I’d been suggesting for some time. Then he told me that at his second session the therapist told him that he’s a great guy who’s working hard and has pretty much cured himself already anyway. And that I should take him back or else the therapy program will definitely not succeed.

When that didn’t work he told me he won’t go to therapy anymore unless I agree to come back. He sent me a text that literally said “No dating, no therapy”.

Now I’m in therapy to try to figure out why it took me so long to realize he’s a huge asshole.

AskReddit,f06hgup,t1_f05scp6,1568437977.0,"Hi... I’m 29 (actually today is my birthday) and just got out of an emotionally abusive relationship. This guy told me he loved me more than anything, and did small things every day to show that- bringing me tea, talking about our plans for the future, watching movies I liked together, giving me costco pajamas etc. 

Then if something minor made him feel bad about himself, or not important, whether it was related to me or not, he would fly into a crazy rage where he would yell, call me a slut, tell me he never cared about me, tell me to go fuck other guys, etc.

It was crazy. I never thought I’d be a person to tolerate that kind of stuff, but I’ve also never been with someone I felt so loved by and connected to... apart for the part where he told me I was worthless (approximately once a month). I had tried to convince him to get therapy ages ago when it began, but he insisted either 1) his feelings were justified, because he’s an emotional person / he got triggered from something that reminded him of his past ex, or 2) we just needed to move on and pretend it didnt happen.

I don’t know what my point is with this, except that it was the most bizarre experience, and you’re a very strong person for getting out. I finally left my person after he really crossed a line, and I still miss him a lot. Now he’s apparently “realized he really hurt me” and is going to therapy- but I dont understand how someone could have demonstrated so much love for me early on could have not realized he was hurting me when I was crying and telling him “hey you are hurting me”.

Now I’m scared there’s something about me that is just unloveable, or something that provokes people I get close to to start thinking they dont need to treat me with any basic respect..."
stepparents,ezkamns,t3_d19l7a,1567957570.0,"I had a similar experience- I’m 28F and my boyfriend was 41M with two daughters, who were 8 and 12 when we met. 

Our relationship didn’t work out, which I’m still really sad about, but it was mostly due to my ex’s untreated depression, and his difficulty with not projecting his relationship issues from his ex wife onto me, not anything about the age difference or kids. We dated for about a year.

I met his kids the first time when we were friends but not yet dating. We went to a high school football game together. After we started dating and he let them know (which was REALLY soon, about 2 months later), our first meeting was me coming over for dinner and us watching a movie together. His logic with having me meet them early was that it would help us all grow to get to know each other gradually, rather than him forcing in a very serious, established SO when we would be close to being ready to get married. I actually think this worked really well, because the three of us bonded a lot.

I agree with the “fun uncle” or “fun aunt” kind of thing. I did zero real discipline. I mostly hung out with them as an adult friend who cared about them a lot and wanted to do fun things with their whole family together. I helped the younger daughter with her homework and picked her up from after school daycare 1 day a week, and helped my ex prepare dinner every day, which helped me stay in the adult category while being a friend. And my ex was great about emphasizing to them that I cared about all three of them, which was great since I kind of struggle with expressing feelings. The 8 year old was really close to me, then went through about a 3 month period where she pushed me away, and then became really close to me again after I picked her up at school one day when she was sick and both of her bio parents were not available.

Sorry this was long! With the age difference thing, I think it’s not really a relationship issue- I felt really close to my ex, more than I have to people my age that I’ve dated. But it can be weird being a millenial suddenly thrust into a “parental figure of a 13 year old” position. My mom was very upset about my relationship. Also, although my ex looked very young (I thought he was 35 when we met), when we went to his daughters’ band concerts the other parents looked so old to me :D

The other thing was that my ex was married to his ex wife for 14 years. Allegedly they started having problems in the first year, but their first daughter was born quickly and they tried to stick it out. He initiated the divorce so he thought he’d be fine afterwards, but he kind of projected weird stuff onto me- for example, if his ex wife used to criticize him about his kind of control freak cleaning habits, he would get really defensively aggressive with me expecting me to have a problem as well, even though i hadnt said anything and honestly don’t give a fuck how he cleans stuff. Our relationship was amazing at first, but this stuff tore it apart- so my advice is *make sure he’s really moved on* and isn’t going to hold you responsible for his ex’s actions.

Also it *really really sucks* to break up after you start to feel like you’re part of a family with children. I still miss them a lot and feel like they’re still out there all three having a great time together, and I’m pretty much alone."
BPD,eya089j,t3_cvq5ho,1566956095.0,"My boyfriend / ex boyfriend seems to have bpd, and this sounds like what he tells me- what he describes is:

1. He goes over the top trying to be the perfect partner for me (which he really does)
2. Everything is awesome!
3. I have an off day (stress at work or with my family etc) and seem kind of quietly down, or slip up not doing something he believes he would have done for me if our roles were reversed (phrasing something in a weird way, not doing a household chore etc).
4. He feels bad about himself because if I’m slipping up it can only be because he’s failing at the relationship
5. He decides to “show me what a terrible person he is” by flipping out and yelling abuse at me
6. I cry and leave
7. 48 hours later, heartfelt apology, he seems genuinely shocked by what happened, revert to step 1.

It’s hard because after our last incident, he has been going to therapy, but the therapist is just telling him generic things like “take deep breaths when you’re angry” which I feel is really missing the depth of the situation.

And I’m scared and worried for him and not sure how I can help :( And I also feel awful from the verbal abuse, even though I deeply feel he doesn’t really mean it.

AskReddit,eu3ry8u,t1_eu2d59u,1563423433.0,"I think I’m in that situation right now- I love my ex a lot and really care about him, but ended it recently as he was becoming seriously emotionally unstable.

I went back to the city I grew up in over the 4th of July weekend to visit some friends, and he became convinced that me being in the city would remind me of my previous ex boyfriend (who I havent seen in years) and lead to me breaking up with him. So he refused to communicate with me at all via text, phone, anything, while I was on my trip. When I tried to reassure him that I wasn’t planning to leave him, he flipped out and yelled at me to stay in Texas forever : / 

It sounds silly but really shook me up. And unfortunately this is the 5th or 6th similar incident of exploding over imagined fear of abandonment. I felt like I had to leave, but still worry about him, and kind of still worry that I might have made a mistake on some level? I don’t know if I’ll find anyone that i feel as close to as I did with him.

The other issue I had was that my ex’s emotional explosions didn’t seem to be directly in response to something consistent- like it’s not like I went out with friends, he expressed that he didn’t like it, and then he exploded. Instead it was apparently random (i.e. I wore an outfit that indirectly reminded him of an outfit I wore in a photo with my ex boyfriend). The total unpredictability and my inability to meet those kind of random expectations (because it’s impossible!) really messed with me. He kept insisting that if I really loved him I would be meeting his random unconscious expectations all the time.

I was actually thinking of going to an ACA meeting. My dad was an alcoholic, and the “laundry list” thing they have on their site includes not seeking relationships with unstable personalities, and rebuilding self esteem. I think “codependent” is a strong label that mostly makes me feel worse about myself, but it might be helpful for me to talk to some other people about this.

What’s hard for me is that it’s like he had two personalities- one was really sweet, loving, and caring, in a way I hadn’t experienced before. The other one was explosive, scary and cruel. They alternated about every 3 weeks or so, so it’s not like all the good times were in the beginning. 

Although logically I know that they’re both part of him, I have a really difficult time emotionally understanding that they’re not two sets of people. I keep catching myself missing the sweet guy emotionally, and then have to force myself to remember that if I take him back I’m getting the abusive asshole back too. 

It’s very tiring, and I’m sure I’ll still feel this way after a lot of time has passed! Absolutely nothing is wrong with you... it’s a crazy situation, which is why you might feel so emotionally thrown for a loop."

I made therapy a condition for staying.

He does have abandonment issues, and was also abused pretty severely as a kid : / So I know where it’s coming from. I think we both thought it would improve as we dated longer and he became more comfortable in the relationship, but it doesn’t seem to be happening."

I temporarily left him, and he told me he realizes it’s a problem now, and will go to therapy. He wants me to give it another shot but I feel burnt out from dealing with his tantrums and generally not feeling like he gets why they really hurt me. We’ve been dating about 1 year."

stepparents,ethient,t1_ethfop1,1562816405.0,"Thanks- that sounds really similar to my situation.

I’d also potentially see his kids around the apartment complex. Do you think I need to try to move earlier?

I’m trying to get into therapy next week too.

I think I’ve gotten kind of nervous around my bf because I don’t know what will set him off. Some days he just decides he’s a worthless person. Then when I come home from work and say “hey sweetie, how was your day”, I get something like “well I did the best I could considering how much I fuck up everything in my life”. Or sometimes it’s loosely related to me- for example one time I was wearing a shirt that he recognized from an old photo of me when I was in grad school, which reminded him that I had been dating someone else in grad school and triggered a breakdown. I can try to calm him down, but usually by the time it’s visible to me that there’s a problem it’s too late : /


I just want to help, but I worry sometimes that I’m either contributing to it and making it worse, or that it’s not controllable?

Also some of the stuff he has said to ne feels borderline emotionally abusive. I don’t want to be the person who stays in a relationship too long because they believe their partner doesnt mean to be abusive.... but I seriously do feel like he genuinely has no control over it, it’s like he can be 2 different people. I tried setting boundaries on that, and it seemed to help quite a bit, but I’m still worried that it even happened.

And on the other hand, he also really dramatically expresses love- when he’s feeling “up” he treats me better than anyone else I’ve ever dated. At those times he’s really considerate and loving, and feels like he automatically knows how I’m feeling and is really in sync with me.

Oats are often harvested with the same equipment as wheat so even though oats are gluten free, oatmeal often contains tiny wheat grains. Celiacs or people with severe allergies should look for oatmeal that says “certified gluten free oats”, which are oats where the random gluten grains have been filtered out. 

Some people have less / different immediate symptoms than others even if they all have celiacs, so some people might appear to tolerate non-GF oats better.

Also some celiacs develop lactose intolerance just because their digestive system is so torn up from the untreated celiacs. So they’re kind of linked but not because milk has gluten. Maybe something like this is up with you and the rice?

stepparents,eruivoy,t3_c3dpuc,1561282510.0,"Hey... I’m 28(F) dating a guy who’s 41(M) with two daughters, SD13 and SD9 for about a year. 

I was kind of freaked out when we started dating more by the concept of the situation than actual events. I’m not really old enough to be SD13’s parent, and going from thinking of myself as “single millennial person” to “potential step mom to preteens” gave me kind of an identity crisis. I was also really worried that they’d hate me. Then after I became attached to them I started worrying about scenarios like “BM decides to move to another state, taking SKs etc” and “SD9 freaks out if SO and I actually get married” etc. I can be kind of an overthinker. People (including strangers?) also keep “helpfully” telling me things like “you know you’ll always come second to his kids” which is not really helpful.

As someone with no kids, what helped for me is that my SO (and their BM when they’re with them, I assume) is clearly their parent. SO handles dinner, laundry, cleaning, packing lunches, and parenting instructions. The only “job” I have is homework help with SD9 and picking them up from school / daycare. I think this has helped a lot with both me not feeling shoved into a role I’m not ready for, and them not feeling like I’m trying to replace a parent / like they need to resent me. It also helps that their parents had what sounds like an awful time in their marriage, and especially SD13 has expressed relief at the decrease in tension compared to when their parents were together. 

SD9 has had some issues with feeling like I might be taking more of their dad’s affection. She would do stuff like yell at us not to kiss (like quickly kissing when I left or arrived, nothing inappropriate) and tell her dad that her dad wasnt allowed to ride a bike with me unless SD9 was their because biking was their thing. What helped was me spending more time with SD9 individually so she thinks of me more of “another adult who cares about SD9” rather than “someone competing with SD9 for time with SO” if that makes sense. This was probably the hardest thing for me to deal with because I felt excluded and had a hard time not taking it personally. Sometimes reading posts on this sub saying things like “stepparents are always outsiders, especially ones without kids” made this feeling worse... however I also got some good advice and reassurance that many 9 year olds do this from this sub :)

The other big issue we have is that my SO struggles with depression, which gets worse when SKs are with their mom. 

How old is your SK? I feel like it might actually be more difficult with a younger child, although clearly I don’t know. My friends with biological children (infants) all look absolutely exhausted. Do you feel like you’re losing yourself because of the sudden amount of time spent on childcare? Would you feel comfortable telling your SO something like “on tuesday/thursday I will be doing [activity] after work / in the evening, so I won’t be back til 9 pm” or something along those lines? Maybe actively scheduling time for yourself outside the house will help you feel more like yourself if that’s something you’re missing out on?"
stepparents,erl1goo,t1_erk5zzn,1560976115.0,"I think there's a big difference between talking about their mom / memories that they had together vs. directly saying things like ""I wish mommy and daddy were back together"" or ""daddy do you love mommy"" or anything that implies they wish their stepmom wasn't there.

My stepkids talk about their mom with me sometimes, and it's a little uncomfortable, but ok. Some examples are ""my mom likes to listen to lots of music"" (from SD9) and ""my mom did X when she was in high school"" (from SD13). I usually say something like ""oh, that's interesting"" or ""your mom sounds cool"".

They used to go on a lot of vacations when their parents were together, and I don't really like hearing ""remember how much fun it was when you and mom and us did X in Spain"", but I'm ok with sucking it up.

However if they said anything that came off as ""we wish mom was here instead of echopotato"" or even ""we wish mom and dad were still together"" I'd feel really awful. .

I think it might be helpful for OP to her SO that she doesn't mind them talking about their mom generally, but she'd appreciate if her SO could talk to them about some specific questions /statements that are especially hurtful to her.

My SO also doesn't discourage them from talking about me to their mom, which I know SD9 does (apparently stuff along the lines of ""echopotato has a really cute cat""). I think my SO is actually happy that they're demonstrating to her that they like me.

Another caveat, SO and their BM did not seem to hide their relationship issues well at all when they were together, which I think plays a huge role in their acceptance of me."

AskReddit,erk0scl,t1_erjmy42,1560952475.0,"I feel like this- I’m 28 and just finished my PhD. I have a job as a research scientist that’s nice, but I don’t have the same passionate focus on it that I had on my grad school research, and some of my coworkers annoy me a lot. I also had to move for my job, so I’m in a different city than all of my friends (who are in my grad school city) and family (who live in my hometown). The guy I was dating for 2 years (and living with) didn’t want to move with me immediately, and I was so upset by this that I abruptly broke up with him right after I moved. And now I feel like I don’t have anything in common with the version of me from 1 year ago, which is super disorienting.

I kind of realized that I really defined myself by my PhD topic and my friends. Now I’m not sure who I am or what I should be doing, and I feel kind of sad to have lost all that certainty.... even though theoretically, getting a job and moving was what I wanted."
stepparents,erh3x9o,t1_ercz500,1560866516.0,"I am worried about the FAFSA.... SO and I work together so when we get married the total income will double. His older daughter is 13.

I was only able to go to college because my parents made so little (only my dad was working, as a teacher) that the FAFSA helped us out a lot. I suspect that if our incomes are added FAFSA will give us nothing, and I know that SO has no idea about this stuff (he’s not from the US). 

Will their BM still be required to pay something? She’s the custodial parent and has a job, but we’d be the higher earning household. We split time with kids 50/50... custodial just means that she gets to make medical decisions in this case."
stepparents,erh1z00,t1_eregdrz,1560865030.0,"Hey, thanks  :) It’s fine that it’s not advice, it just helps to talk about it a little bit and hear that other people have been in similar situations. 

I love my SO and want to stay with him. I also want him to be happy, because he deserves to be, and because I love him. My sister had depression in college, so do I know not to say dumb well meaning things like “have you tried being happier”... I think with my SO, his depression comes out as him saying me and his kids would be better off without him around since he can’t keep us happy.... which makes me feel guilty and like I need to fix it.

I think I probably need to look for some therapy for myself even if my SO wont go"
stepparents,ered9rn,t1_er57ou0,1560781109.0,"This sounds like my SO... he hasn’t been diagnosed (because he won’t see a therapist...) but he has something like depression, and gets really strong feelings that nobody wants him around, and that he’d be better off “just disappearing”.

He hides it around his kids, but usually either doesn’t or can’t hide it around me on the weeks we don’t have them. I also think his kids not being there contributes to making it worse.

I also have a really difficult time feeling like it’s not me! And I understand that he’s going through a lot of shit, but it’s not good if we can’t be happy together when we’re alone, right?

He told me that it helps if I’m just there hanging out with him saying nothing when he’s sad. My first impulse is to keep poking him asking him what’s wrong all the time, which i’ve been told does not help :) I can do this... but I’d like to do fun things with him also?

Would you have any advice for how to approach this with him? He’s from a country where therapy is less mainstream than the US and thinks it’s “for crazy people” and that he is just a person who has a lot of mood swings. When I’ve tried to suggest he should go because of the effect this has on me, he feels criticized and like I’m unhappy in our relationship, and gets more depressed :("
AskReddit,er5mc4m,t1_er3ymuh,1560528981.0,"This is really hard for me- I’m a woman, I have a PhD in electrical engineering, and work as a research scientist. I’m the only woman in the group I work in. 

Our manager, who’s maybe 50, always makes sure I get a chance to talk during meetings, but when I’m alone with the three other guys my age (~30) they cut me off constantly when I talk, and disregard my suggestions, even though my PhD is directly in the area that we work in, and theirs are not. I tried bringing it up with one of them, and he told me it just happens naturally because my sentences are too long : | 

They are condescending and terrible and I hate going to work with them. It makes me want to leave the group, even though I was so lucky to get this position in the first place.

Also just to note- most of the other men and ladies I work on other projects with are perfectly fine, and we all give each other feedback pretty equally. I don’t know what’s up with these guys particularly."
stepparents,eq0t7he,t1_epx0g5x,1559693710.0,Do you know how he made it stop? :D
stepparents,eq0t3sw,t1_eptjwm1,1559693628.0,"So this kind of happened again today... we all went out to get icecream. I told my SO “hey, take your sunglasses off” (in a nice way). SD9 immediately said “no, dad, keep them on!” and then kept saying “why wont you put them back onnnnnn” after he took them off.

Another example. Yesterday I reminded their SO to drink water. SD9 said “my dad drinks enough water! Don’t tell him what to do!”

Both times my SO just tells her to relax, and then tries to give her extra attention later. I am kind of lost with how to handle this part. I know she’s going through a lot, and I should be the mature one here, but it’s tough having a kid trying to give “subtle” hints that you shouldn’t be there all the time. Honestly if she was like this when her dad and I started dating it would have been what I expected, and would have bothered me less- I think it feels worse because it randomly started up 8 months in."
AskReddit,epxy8qd,t1_epxi2hl,1559614056.0,"I needed this. I’m 28, suddenly went from single grad student to dating a divorced guy 10 years older than me with two kids (13 and 9).

All 3 of them are incredibly awesome, but it’s kind of weird explaining to people when everyone else my age is following the same basic school / job / first marriage / baby path. I always thought I wasn’t the kind of person to care what people think, but it’s kind of disconcerting to be on a totally different track. 

I also feel like I dodged a bullet a little bit though... kids seem more fun to hang out with than infants from what I can tell"
stepparents,eptusdr,t1_eptkn04,1559498025.0,"SD13 is definitely too cool, so it must be somewhere in between there :)

And thanks! We don’t live together, but I hang out at their apartment a lot. My main “parenty” role is helping SD9 do her homework (maybe that’s why she’s pushing me out... hmm...)"
stepparents,eptjiem,t3_bvy87r,1559491508.0,"SD9 does this. She didn’t used to, when I first met her she was actually pretty demanding of attention from me. About 3 months ago she started this thing of pushing herself between me and her dad all the time. Yesterday she actually tried pushing me away with her feet so I couldn’t sit next to her dad while we were all watching a movie. She did this while she was laying on her dad’s lap, so it’s not like we’re sitting together and making her sit alone in a corner facing a wall or something

It’s annoying, and makes me feel rejected. SO and I both notice it and don’t know why it’s happening. He tried talking to her about how i’m not here to replace either him or her mom, and she said she knows, but it didnt help.

She also gets equally jealous when her dad spends any time with her older sister SD13, and tries to push herself between them as well.

I kind of wrote it off as her being annoying / hopefully some kind of phase (does that sound really mean?). I get all the time with my SO on the weeks that they’re not here (theyre one on, one off) so I just make up for it then.

Note- theyre not actually my SDs, SO and I have been dating for about a year."
AskReddit,ep7c5v9,t1_ep6vlan,1559079935.0,"Oh, yeah, so question about this. I adopted my cat while I was in Texas, and the vet scared the crap out of me about making sure to give my cat the heartworm medicine on time. I was very convinced she would definitely get heartworm and die if I missed a dose.

Now we live in Oregon. Is it still super important here? She’s an indoor cat. I’ll probably still keep giving it to her regardless, so I guess I’m just curious?

By the way, in Oregon it is not legally required to get your pet vaccinated for rabies. Or to get your brakes inspected yearly. It’s illegal to signal another car to pass you, though."
AskReddit,eosrvqh,t1_eokoo9r,1558828200.0,"Oh no, that sounds really frustrating, and him moving to be with you probably adds some feeling of pressure that it “needs to” work out for him. 

The job thing sounds like it would be the biggest stressor- have you tried setting some kind of hard deadline for him, or talking to him seriously about how it’s a problem? Sorry if these are really obvious questions, I’m just wondering how that goes when you’ve discussed it. I know with my boyfriend, he really shuts down if he feels criticized at all (and starts just excessively criticizing himself rather than listening) so i think the challenge would be bringing up how it’s absolutely critical that he gets a job and builds his own life in your city without sounding like you’re saying “why havent you done this yet”. Maybe try reassuring him that you know he’s totally capable of doing this, and that you’ll be really proud of him for going to the interview and giving it a shot?

My boyfriend looks fine outwardly- we actually met at work, and only a few of his closest coworkers and friends have picked up that he’s struggling. He hides it really well from most people. He has a lot of trouble controlling his emotions, which leads to sudden depression, sudden talking about how he’s worthless, or a couple of times sudden anger - but the anger’s more like “I guess you’re going to leave me anyway, so go on and leave” than anything about a specific issue. It gets worse when he’s tired, and absolutely terrible when he’s jet lagged. But he maintains his apartment really well, helps his family with their issues, helps me with my issues, and tries really hard to keep everything running smoothly even when he’s mentally on the edge.

But, I’m sure other people have told you, if the situation is getting out of control, you need to end it for your own sanity. He moved there with you, but he can always move back or start his own life wherever he wants if the relationship ends. Maintaining his life should be his own responsibility first, it’s going to be too much for you to handle everything for 2 people."
AskReddit,eosqe90,t1_eoqkwt9,1558827469.0,"Just curious, when you come out of a depressive episode, does something usually trigger it? Do you try to convince yourself out of the depression, or does it just lift totally spontaneously?"
AskReddit,eoknleq,t1_eoi7rdl,1558658826.0,"Hey, I’m dating someone with PTSD also. We keep having the same fight over and over- he spontaneously convinces himself I’m going to leave him, or that he’ll “screw up” our relationship in some way and I’ll leave him, and starts pre-emptively trying to push me away. There doesn’t seem to be any way to permanently convince him that everything’s fine, and that I’m not going anywhere, so I just keep repeating it to him :)

If anyone has advice on how to handle this please do let me know!

And for the record, I’ve never felt he was a burden.... I just get concerned and wish I could help more"
