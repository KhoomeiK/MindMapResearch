AskReddit,fon2v01,t3_g88ccd,1587910948.0,"I was maybe around 12 years old and my family and I came back from the beach. I was dead tired so I slept early. I woke up at night, no idea what time it was, to go to the bathroom. I passed by my cousin’s room to which the door was open and I saw her, head half down, with her long hair covering most of her face. I called out her name but she didn’t reply. I just thought she was also half-awake and couldn’t answer yet. I just shrugged it off and just wanted to go back to sleep. The next morning I remembered what I saw and asked her what she was doing. Turned out there was no body in the house but me since my family, including my cousin, went out for dinner that night leaving me to sleep. This wasn’t the first ghost stories I had in our old house but that one was probably the scariest as whatever I saw looked exactly like her."
