KnightsOfPineapple,fnu4kst,t1_fnti6z3,1587254432.0,"Likely true, however face masks are being strongly encouraged due to the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. In other words, you and I might actually have the virus right now and feel perfectly fine, from the time we get infected to the time it passes, yet still be contagious for several days or weeks.

This means that I could go out with *zero* idea that I have COVID-19, and if I don't cover my nose/mouth with cloth, every time I breathe, I'm spreading a virus that is potentially deadly to others. Down the sidewalk, thru grocery aisles, in the pharmacy line.. and many, many people will pick it up in turn. Personally, that's not a risk I'm content with taking.

If you can't find a mask or afford to purchase one, the CDC has [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) on how to make your own cloth face covering without any sewing skills or supplies. A scarf can do in a pinch, though.

Sorry to get all preachy on you, just hoping to help. Please be safe and cover up.. for yourself, for everyone. <3"

I'd know... I was raised hardcore right wing. so in my own life I've had to undo a couple decades of propaganda such as... the idea of the government being anything more than a local police department, fire station and courtroom, kept on a leash by the watchful eye of a well armed and morally ironclad populace, is an intolerable infringement on your freedom by the power grabbing leftist socialist elite.

How ass backwards, insane and ridiculous does that sound. Yet it's so normal for me to type that out because it's just one example of the ideas I grew up with (I was sheltered af too, so ideas to the contrary were never entertained).

It's soooooooo fucked up, dude. I'm really trying to undo all the indoctrination I experienced as a child and youth, but my life was.. kind of extreme. As much as I'm tempted to rehash it, it should be visible in my recent post history if you're morbidly curious enough to go there.

Sorry if I'm oversharing here, just trying to confirm your statement. Propaganda can be really, *really* effective and I'd be the first to know, lol."

To my credit I was a teenager at the time with a sheltered conservative background, but still... it's enough to make me not trust myself on political opinions maybe ever again."
ftm,fmxecym,t3_fxss3x,1586463415.0,"(TW: my post is... kind of intense.)

It was for me, but then again I also have a long history of psychological abuse and gaslighting, plus a super conservative family/former social circle who thinks that ""transgenderism is a mental disorder"" and ""you need to accept reality on reality's terms"" (meaning, force yourself to live as the sex you were assigned at birth).

Honestly, what I experienced was pretty extreme. I was raised in a sheltered Objectivist ""clan"" my whole life, listening to nothing but rightwing talk radio and kept from media with the faintest tinge of ""leftist propaganda."" I wasn't allowed to talk to other kids unless under close supervision, was pulled out of the Objectivist school I'd been going to around age 12 and not given further education, moved several times, started militia training at 15, was committed to die fighting the government alongside the rest of my family if they ""came to take our guns"" (and functioned as a recruiter and instructor for three years).. and then at 18, ran away with a super misogynistic, even *more* rightwing guy eleven years my senior who'd been molesting me and grooming me into a financially exploitative relationship starting at age 15, under my parents' consent.

During this whole time I KNEW something was up with me.. something beyond the weird, fucked up matrix I was already born into. Something different. As long as I can remember being referred to as ""a girl"" absolutely fucking *broke* me inside. But I hadn't heard the word ""trans"" until I was a teenager, and then it wasn't until even later that I learned people assigned female at birth can be trans, too (not just vice versa).

But I wasn't even able to say the words ""I'm trans"" to myself until the age of 21, just a year ago, and finally stop fighting what I knew to be so deeply, undeniably true. Part of my resistance was due to the fact that acknowledging this came with facing the reality of, well.. the rest of my situation at the time, because I didn't have the courage, resources or social support to leave that aforementioned abuser guy until... last October. Needless to say I'm kind of slow on the uptake sometimes, and often it takes a crisis for me to stop denying my own feelings and making excuses for other people.

So yeah. If you've read this far for whatever reason, suffice to say my situation is pretty unusual. I'm hardly a case study for what you might call an ""average"" trans person, but likely am for one struggling with his sexuality/gender identity amidst a lifetime of abuse and brainwashing. But I'm full of morning coffee and Prozac so naturally I'm going to start oversharing, lol. 

Hope it helps shed some light on your nephew's struggles and please feel free to AMA. I'm certainly far from being healed, but I'm also at a point where I feel comfortable with discussing my experience and helping others talk through their feelings. Mental health is a motherfucker, but we all need someone to reach out to for help."
Portland,fmx98qs,t3_fwwz62,1586460771.0,"Trans guy checking in. I was supposed to get consulted for top surgery this summer but honestly, I feel like a self indulgent A-hole at the thought of asking my doctor to see if that's still possible in the wake of... everything.

Like, bruh. People are DYING and here you are wondering when you can get a hospital bed for some... cosmetic thing... ?

I just wish there was more I could do to help beyond what I'm doing already. It's been making me very seriously consider training to become something more helpful to society than just a factory worker... like an EMT or some other first response/rescue type job.

Not sure where to start though."
