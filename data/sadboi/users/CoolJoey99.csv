Just reading won't do shit. You can't just change your mindset by just reading. Applying is more important than reading. You can treat reading as a part of it, but not the key.

You can start by taking care of how you look, get a haircut, be clean, wear clothes that look good on you.

Next, start working out consistently. The key word here is consistent. You can do it just three days a week but do not miss those three days ever. 

Abundance is the next step. You need reach the threshold first."
