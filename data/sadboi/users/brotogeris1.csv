Because we RBN always encounter people that say how great our parents are, and always say things like it couldn’t really be that bad, or some version of “I’ve never heard of such a thing, it cannot possibly be true”, I wonder if you would entertain a question. Your answer may help us here. You say that you dismissed his warnings out of naïveté and ignorance. The news, every single day that all of us have been alive, is filled with stories of all manner of human brutality, cruelty, malice, etc. All of society has had a steady diet of how unbelievably awful people can be, every single day, without fail. So, respectfully, my question is about the disconnect between naïveté/ignorance, and the reality of the world around you, every single day of your life. How does this disconnect exist? You’re one of multitudes that RBNs have encountered. I’m not picking on you, you just happen to be in the thread. I think if we could understand your thought process, it could be helpful. Bear in mind that we have had to live with parents like your boyfriend’s, and also deal with unending streams of people not believing us. Thanks, and I hope you both get out of there ASAP.

If imagining alone doesn’t do the trick, try going without indoor plumbing for 24 hours. Then add electricity. No precious internet, no video games, no fridge, no heat or a/c. I would challenge a person that can’t find gratitude to actually do this.
