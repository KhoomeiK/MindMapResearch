television,fj1emcp,t1_fj14j3i,1582918465.0,"Kanimozhi (DMK) won Tuticorin constituency contesting against Tamilisai Soundarrajan (BJP). Here is the first one minute of the interview (I am only paraphrasing), Full Interview Video

NDTV Anchor: Congratulations Kanimozhi on your victory! Why do you think NDA failed in TN but they won everywhere else?

Kanimozhi: TN has been affected a lot because of the BJP government. Neet Exam, for example, formers agitating, and hydrocarbon & methane project brought to TN by BJP. farmer crop insurance did not come to TN. We have been affected very badly by GST & by demonetization. Unemployment is rampant & we believe in a secular government and that is what Dravidian movement meant.

so let me break down Kanimozhi's answer which is full of misrepresentation and lies.

No state in India protests against NEET except TN. NEET scheme came into existence and implemented during congress government (2013) all over India. BJP has nothing to with it. NEET Wiki

Note: DMK is in UPA alliance and the only party openly supported Rahul Gandhi for PM.

Formers agitating - Ayyakannu, the person who led these protests later told media that he was asked to protestby DMK. He later asked everyone to vote BJP. Ayyakannu Link

Hydrocarbon and Methane - both projects came to TN during congress government and Kanimozhi's brotherMK Stalin is the one who signed the deal while he was deputy chief minister of TN. Stalin Signing MoU

Farmers insurance did not come - Not sure what she means here. The agricultural insurance scheme is nationallevel, I couldn't find anyone complaining that it did not come to only TN. I don't have any source toprove/disprove the claim.

GST and Demonetization - No state in India seem to complain GST (even the ones BJP lost) and I don'tknow why Kanimozhi is bringing that as a main point. I can definitely give some points for showingdemonetization as a reason.

In fact Kanimozhi, in 2016, as Rajyasabha MP voted in favor of GST bill since this was originally proposed by Congress government. Only ADMK opposed the bill Kanimozhi voting YES for GST

Unemployment - I agree 45 years high

We believe in Secular and that is what Dravidian movement is about - I am not sure if DMK is more secular thanBJP because DMK goons openly insult Hindu gods/deities with shameful vulgar words but go celebrateChristmas and Ramzan at churches and mosques. veeramani Insulting Lord Krishna Karunanidhi at Iftar Party Karunanidhi Wishing Christmas

Note: DMK is an atheist party that doesn't believe in God. This logic doesn't apply to Islam and Christianity because of vote bank.

I am done here! So many lies and misrepresentation in less than 1 min of the interview. Imagine what impact they can make if they appear on TV every day on every channel. I really feel pity for people of my state (TN) as they innocently believe everything their politicians say.

If you've given hints and she still acts like nothing has happened, it's a huge red flag that she's not into you and is probably playing nice by ignoring your moves/flirty behaviour. Move on.

There's a very small chance that she likes you and knows that you like her, but wants you to make the first move. So assuming that you're this optimistic, go for it. Otherwise, consider the first two options."
