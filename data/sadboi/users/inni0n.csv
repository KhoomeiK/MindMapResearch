Accutane,foho706,t3_g7hwdl,1587769383.0,"Hello, doctor here, not a dermatologist and not American so I'm not sure how things work there.

What I would recommend tho is trying to change your dermatologist. You need someone you can trust and someone who will trust you. Someone who understands how acne affects mental health.

And there's always a chance a different dermatologist won't ask for psychiatric approval.

Secondly I'd like to ask if you've tried taking topical and oral antibiotics? And also if you've tried applying topical retinoids? For some people that may be enough to get them cleared.

Also, laser helps some people and facial (the ones where they open your pores and drain your closed comedones). Might be worth a try.

I am also an acne sufferer so I know how much it sucks. All the aforementioned treatments failed for me so I was put on accutane.

Best of luck. Remember you're beautiful."
Accutane,fohlw2o,t1_foh6bsw,1587768136.0,Exactly the same here. I stopped purging on month 5 (entering month 6 now) and even now I get an occasional mini pimple that goes away fast without a scar. Despite my awful scarring it feels amazing not to wake up with a new bump on my face 🥰
Accutane,fohl5l0,t1_foh0up5,1587767786.0,"She may have had a lot of microcomedones that would have turned into acne over time. That was my case. 

I had very mild but persistent acne and I scar reaaaally easily. I'd get one or 2 new pimples a month and a scar that would last over a year. I was prescribed accutane due to the condition of my skin - oily, tons of microcomedones that would eventually become acne (closed comedones in English i think), lots of scarring and potential for even deeper scarring if I didn't take accutane.

u/marietea123 what you're experiencing is purging due to a higher dosage. All of these pimples would have surfaced even if you never took accutane. Accutane just pushes what's in your skin already, it doesn't cause acne. It's impossible (unless you're allergic but that would come with other side effects too).

My before and after pics also seemed reversed. It has to get worse to get better. I'm acne free now but with tons of red scarring that I will work on after finishing (entering month 6 now - 40-40-40-50-50-40). Your dosage was lower that's why you're only purging now on a higher dosage. Please stick with it. It will be worth it.

If you need to talk to anyone feel free to DM me. I'm also a doctor so maybe I can answer more of your questions. Not a dermatologist tho!

Edit - would like to add that my purge started on week one and lasted until the end of month four. My acne went from very mild to severe with huge cystic acne. It was horrible and I was hopeless and hating everything. But god was it worth it. Those acne would have surfaced anyway. Now at least I got it all over with."
BFS,fohc0s8,t1_foh7p5j,1587763440.0,"I'm pretty sure you'd start to develop some symptoms. I have also been twitching for over 10 months now and have developed a lot of weird sensory symptoms which can be so intense that twitching now almost comes secondary. But no weakness. And bfs isn't *only* twitching. 

It's normal to be worried. I know how it feels, but time is of the essence here. You've been twitching for a long time and due to your age you aren't really in the risk group. Also, as I wrote above, that awful disease in the vast majority of cases starts as weakness. Twitching comes as a side effect to neurons dying thus causing muscle denervation which causes twitching. Twitching is usually end stage symptom. That's what I always tell myself when I'm anxious about it.

Try not to think about it. Really. Look at it as a nasty little quirk you have. Be fascinated by it but not afraid. You'll notice it will start to bother you less and one day you'll notice you went 24hrs without a single twitch. Bfs is nasty but it's benign so let's be thankful for that.

Happy twitching!"

I support further studies being done for the small % of people who did suffer permanent damage so we can get to the bottom of if and why that happens.

I made this post because one person claimed eczema due to dry hands is absolute proof you've ruined your life and will have permanent damage. That is fearmongering and may affect the mental health of people who tried everything before deciding to go on accutane despite knowing how tough side effects can be.

It's not okay to throw false claims about permanent damage at these people who have been struggling for ages. Accutane is tough as it is, especially with depression it can cause.

I as a doctor have the obligation to report every new side effect (and if someone told me accutane caused permanent damage I would report it) but its up to the scientists to prove it.

What I'm here for is to warn people not to trust people online who give unsolicited advises and harass you until you break. Raising awareness of a specific side effect is absolutely welcome but that's where it stops. Any further worries or questions you may have you should discuss with your dermatologist.

Truth is every medication has horrible side effects which are most commonly very rare. As I mentioned in a comment below, just look at paracetamol side effects and you'll find that some are horrific yet I don't see people fearmongering others about potential dangers of paracetamol.

My point being, yes every medicine is potentially dangerous, but you should talk to your doctor if there are concerns and not trust people on the Internet to tell you what to do (me included) and definitely not allow someone to scare you into quitting a needed medication prescribed by a trained professional.

Also, as I have mentioned many of these people have proof that their condition isn't related to accutane yet they refuse to believe so.
