CatsAreAssholes,fr5400s,t3_gmm8po,1589902101.0,"Continued enforcement of no means no. Physically pick her up, put her on the ground, say NO in a firm voice, and distract her with something else. Don't kiss or love on her right after you pick her up, don't make her think she's getting love for it, just be firm and insistent that she can't.

We used to have this problem and at my house I wouldn't stop my cat every time, but at my bfs he would stop what he was doing and physically force her to stop and distract her with an acceptable toy. She kept doing it at my place and was less likely to do it at his until we moved in together. I was reinforcing the bad behavior by just yelling and not being clear. He was being clear in what was unacceptable and what was acceptable.

It's a pain in the ass but every time they do that, ya gotta go over and remove them and distract with something else. We started using that method on all of our foster cats too and it worked with each one."

I used these this plastic inserts on my furniture when I was fostering to keep them from scratching up our stuff. You'd need to use tacks for the door but they would work. We also used cardboard while we were finding a solution for one of our fosters once and that helped save the door at least.

When we moved out of our place we used plaster to kinda mold back the doorframe and fill in the gaps of panelling our cat scratched off. Maybe that would be an option?

There are also some cat deterrent sprays... I'm getting one myself next week for my neighbor (feral cats are popping in her garden and I feel guilty) and if it works I'll let you know. It's pretty cheap."

I'd ask the vet there opinion. Some cats prefer to remain outside and you'll have a period where no matter what, he wants to go outside. Get a feeliway diffuser in the room you'll be keeping him while he adjusts, put his food and litter box and water in there, and a bunch of toys and spend a lot of time in there with him.

It sounds like this is a cat you can totally socialize. Take to a vet asap to be positive it doesn't have a microchip (some people let their pets live outside, terrible but it happens) to make sure you're not stealing someone's pet. 

Make sure you keep those two cats separate at all times. Cats need vaccines before they can interact with your cat. With their behavior, they obviously don't have rabies, but they may have rhinovirus, calicivirus, distemper, chlamydia, feline AIDS, or leukemia. 

Check for a microchip and begin vaccines before you integrate with your cat and keep it up! Move slowly. Expect accidents on the ground unless you let the cat back outside (the more they go outside, the more you need to clean for ticks and fleas).

I have a blind feral who does the same thing when she is startled as she feels threatened. What does he do when you make noise by tapping on the door before opening it or noisily getting his attention?
Feral_Cats,fpav0hr,t1_fparo94,1588456276.0,"If you can swing a can of tuna or even better, kitten food, they will be more distracted when they treat and easier to snag."
Feral_Cats,fpae61q,t1_fpad68e,1588446297.0,Lol that's how it goes. This may be a good time to reach out to shelters and see if they have a program to take the kittens once mom is done with them!!!
quityourbullshit,fpa9qpa,t1_fpa3waw,1588443683.0,"You know Alley Cat Allies and the humane society both say this is a helpful way to draw a lost and confused cat back, right? Like, one group of people claiming it doesn't work with no evidence does nothing to prove that it doesnt work."
CatAdvice,fpa7wde,t1_fpa6idf,1588442607.0,It is. I had read on Ally Cats that it would but it def doesn't. Guess it's a strong smell they don't mind
CatAdvice,fpa6phj,t3_gc9xti,1588441917.0,"Sounds like you need local shelters to help you guys, or TNR volunteers. Are you in metro ATL? I'll be happy to help"
Feral_Cats,fpa695s,t1_fpa12oi,1588441656.0,"Yeah shelters can't do the trapping for you unless you sign up for their wait list and that's on hold due to COVID. 

If you can catch them on your own and they are eating solid food, catch and bring them in. If you catch them with your hands, put them in a carrier to keep them together. If you're in Fulton county in GA, lifeline will take them."
Feral_Cats,fpa1qk8,t1_fp9ysj1,1588439047.0,I use a drop trap and a box trap
Feral_Cats,fp9xxey,t1_fp9qnnw,1588436851.0,"You need a trap and put some tuna in there behind the pressure plate. That's really the only way to catch a feral, unless you're willing to sit out there while they eat and try to catch them that way, could take up to an hour if you don't scare them too much, but that's very unlikely to be able to do.

Ask the shelter if they have a trap you can borrow. If you're in metro ATL, I can let you borrow mine."
Marietta,fp9om0e,t1_fp9o994,1588431223.0,"I will be honest, I've been here a year but I still don't know the area much. I'm not surprised there are other chickens around, though! A house behind our townhomes has some too, not even a farm."
