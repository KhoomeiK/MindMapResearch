Rape is a horrible thing, but there ARE A LOT OF HORRIBLE THINGS IN THE WORLD. THE WORLD IS SHIT. If you disagree with the statement ""rape isn't the worst thing that can happen to you"" then you're an idiot. I'm not typing this for interpretation. Saying rape isn't the worst is NOT saying rape isn't bad. There is no need to extrapolate any further, the point I am making is exactly what I have said.

The great thing is that what makes my life not traumatic is that I haven't been raped. (/s) It's good to know I shouldn't have agonized over any of it as it didn't compare to being raped. (/s) The thing is, I still had to move past that trauma to be a healthy person and it would be the same process of healing that someone who was raped would go through.
 
I'm sorry it's sexist to not see my greatest weakness is that of being a woman (and therefore being someone a man can rape). I have no idea what an AMAB is but I will continue to not assume that having a penis automatically makes someone dangerous. 

I did use pussy as an insult because it is an insult? I am clearly not referring to female genitals. I'm sure you're not hot and bothered over the use of the word dick to mean a rude person as if it means having a dick makes you an ass. This is how language works. I do not need the world to stop using the word pussy because I have a vagina. The word pussy doesn't threaten me. If it threatens you, I'm sorry, but I have bigger concerns than about the connection between a word to describe vagina and the word being used as an insult to mean weak. (And I knew when replying that it would be less of a headache to rephrase when I'd typed pussy... but I guess you're lucky enough to have never been called bad names if you think 'pussy' can be so hurtful. I'm glad you haven't been called a bad word before, truly /s)"
relationship_advice,foe6amf,t1_fodgcyx,1587696891.0,"I did mention in the first comment that it would be good to invite another friend along.

Like, it could be true, or she could be 16 and not know what she's talking about. ""Why is he leading her on and trying to get her drunk with strangers"" is again, from the perspective of this 16 year old. It's just as likely that they aren't interested because they don't find her attractive and are inviting her to hang out as a friend. I'm not saying OP is lying, just that she is also a child.

I've never been assaulted but I've been groped a ton of times (like a weird amount of times, all by random strangers) but I never walk around and glance at men wondering if one of them will grab my butt. For every man who *would* rape a woman (or man) is a woman who would fucking destroy your life (doing everything short of sexually assaulting you). So really, if you're not constantly 100% on guard against EVERYONE, what's the use? (And I'm not downplaying the trauma of those who have been raped, but like all other trauma you need to get over it or become a failure of a human being... as awful as it is, being raped isn't the worst possible thing that can happen to you.)

My brother started drinking at 13 and most of the parties were without parental supervision (because they were all way too young to drink) and included girls and him and his friends have never and would never want to hurt a girl like that.

If that dude wanted to have sex with your friend all he'd need to do is tell her he liked her back and then ask to have sex? It would be a lot simpler than setting up some elaborate ruse to trick her. All three would have to be complete psychopaths to plan a gang rape in the woods (which you seem to think is what this is going to be.) If I were you, I'd tell your friend to invite someone else along so she's not on her own, but if you're willing to risk your friendship for narcing on her (when there's no evidence that anything bad will happen) then that's your choice. 16 is the age where you need to start learning from your own mistakes and if she wants to make them then let her."

I quit because my insurance ran out and I wasn't sure the zoloft helped. After years I'm finally settling back into the pattern of mood swings as you describe but it's so much better than feeling empty. I can work to improve my reactions to mood swings so that I don't feel them so intensely but I couldn't bring myself to feel more on the pills. (I almost broke up with my boyfriend because I thought I didn't love him anymore... stopped taking the pills and all the feelings came right back.)   
  
So yes, but I strongly advocate using methods other than medication. Perhaps keep a journal every time you have an intense feeling? Just being aware of it will help you calm down. If you realize you get angry everytime you run out of ketchup then, eventually, even if you feel the rage pumping through your veins, you'll be able to logically know it's because of the ketchup and that even though you're feeling those emotions you don't have to obey them."
BPD,fnwjug6,t3_g4auvs,1587319757.0,"Unfortunately, someone unwilling to get mental health help when they need it is the same as dealing with a partner who is an addict but refuses to get help. You can't say you have to stay with him because you're pregnant. Think of the harm a child will experience from having such an unreliable father.  There's no clear path for you to take going forth, but keep in mind that as a single mother you'd likely be able to get government aid as well as child support from the father. (Of course, I'm going off what is typical for my country in way of aid.) You can meet another man who could be an excellent father. Or even one who doesn't verbally berate you.  
  
That's not to say you have to leave, but if I were you I would make it clear that yes, he has a problem, and yes, I would leave if he continues making no effort to improve. Even without therapy and no money someone who is genuinely trying to improve themselves will make more progress than someone in expensive therapy who doesn't give a shit. I understand that you love him, but having chosen to have a baby you need to put that child and also yourself first. The child didn't chose to be born but imagine all the things that could go wrong in that child's life if you choose to stay with a man who clearly can't be in a relationship. Again, not saying you have to end it, but your partner can either man up and face his problems or continue running away and expecting the world to cater to him.   
  
(As a note, I have BPD. If I acted like that I would want my partner to leave. Staying would condone my actions. Just because I have BPD doesn't mean I get special privileges if I act out. It's a disability and if I don't work hard it could ruin my life, but the fact that it hasn't yet is because I work hard to keep myself in check. If I couldn't admit I was in the wrong then I'd continue doing the same self-destructive shit until I had no one left in my life.)

I'm just throwing out my opinion as someone who was raised by an unchecked BPD parent. My mother never sought help and as a result my upbringing was hellishly unpredictable. I haven't talked to her in 3 years and also don't talk to my dad. He loved my mom more than he loved me and always took her side and never insisted she get help which is just as bad as her the way I see it."

The 3% really doesn't tell you much because, for example, it doesn't say what % of women getting alimony are lower earners because they had to raise the children in the relationship. Not many men stop working to care for a child while their wife works.
  
Again, this stems from the fact that men choose women who earn less (not that women aren't also choosing men who make more) just like men typically choose women shorter than them.  
  
Personally, I think the entire concept of alimony is outdated and dumb. I believe in child support but there's no reason we should be following antiquated divorce laws. Marriage is no longer a man taking a woman into his family and vowing to protect her, it's two people becoming partners in life, but the law doesn't reflect this."

Just from the sample size of myself and my friends, guys don't seem to like being with women who make more than them so they make the choice to be the high earner in the relationship. I once talked about possibly becoming a lawyer and my mailman boyfriend got very freaked out by the possibility of me out-earning him. Men purposely choose women who earn less than them to feel more secure in their masculinity (as well as the assumption that women will only go for guys who make more than them)."

The nurse practitioner had me in the stirups with that dialator rod in my cervix and dropped the IUD on the floor after opening it... they didn't have another copper IUD in the office so I opted for the Mirena so I didn't have to come back another time. They pushed the IUD up there, couldn't get the arms to extend, pulled it back out, pushed it back in, then said it was defective and got another Mirena out that they were finally able to put in. Even with all that it wasn't *that* painful, mostly just annoying."

I got the hormonal one.  
  
What I did was get the IUD at 19 and I mentioned to my doctor at the time that I was interested in sterilization. She was like yeah, whatever you want (at the time I was only 99% sure, not 100%, and I was in school and couldn't take time off for surgery), so when the IUD was up at 25 she performed a bisalp on me and now I'm happily forever childfree."
childfree,fn3m8hj,t3_fyz85m,1586623543.0,"I worked in a law office and the childfree divorces we handled were usually drama free, but once in a while someone wanted to fight over property, usually when one party was a bum and the other was the one pushing for divorce. Of our simple divorces (the couple worked out the details and just needs a lawyer to file everything), they were usually all childfree or their children were grown.   
  
Divorces with kids lead to crazy stuff like 'kidnapping' kids on days they don't have custody, going to court to stop an ex's new boyfriend from being around the kids, fighting to stop a parent from removing the kid from the state, paying hundreds in court sanctions for not forcing their teen to see their dad on his custody days, and many times parents fighting for custody would call in crying or freaking out that they wouldn't get to see their baby.   
  
Our office racked up tons of billable hours just going back and forth with opposing counsel over stupid stuff like who pays for dance class and parent A complaining that parent B shouldn't be doing X and involving the lawyer as mediators because they can't talk directly without a near mental breakdown. It always seemed like parents going through divorce carry a lot more stress about the divorce than their childree counterparts."

curlyhair,fmstc7o,t3_fwze1j,1586361685.0,"You need to detangle completely (or as completely as possible) while the conditioner is in it in the shower. Personally I only finger detangle then I'll only comb it when wet before putting products in for more defined curls. 
  
It may help if you use a cowash instead of shampoo. I only shampoo about once a week but your hair looks drier than mine so you may be able to go longer than that. (Ex schedule, shampoo day 1, cowash day 4, cowash day 7, shampoo day 10). 
  
Between washes seperate your curls with your fingers to make clumps and tangles harder to grow unmanageable (this makes my hair poofy but at least it isn't matted when it comes time for a wash day). If you get a dread that can't be detangled with your fingers, soak it in conditioner for a least ten minutes then slowly pick hairs out with a paperclip or something. (I've purposely dreaded my hair before and never had to cut them out.) If that doesn't work look on youtube for different ways to get dreads out, there are tons of videos.  
  
It looks like your hair needs more moisture, I suggest using a leave in conditioner. I use some shea moisture conditioner I got on sale at Walmart which I use as a leave in and will occasionally use as a deep conditioner (saturate my hair with it and leave it there for a half hour or so). Once you get a better idea of what works for you, a good gel will probably add the definition you want to your curls.  
  
If you're still getting matted curls between washes after all that try getting a satin sleep bonnet. A budget option would be tying a tshirt on your head but while that may stop matting it will probably give you lots of frizz come morning."

When black people come up with something they get to keep it as part of their culture but yet anyone can adopt any portion of white culture at any time for any reason. Just because the words ""big chop"" came from black girls cutting the hair they destroyed trying to make it look white doesn't mean it's insensitive for white girls to use it just because their hair struggles didn't stem from them being black. They way I see it, the people who follow this seperative bullshit don't want people to be racist against them but they want to keep themselves separate from the people they claim they want equality to, down to the use of words.

Why is it that *everything* needs to be devided by race?

You're afraid that feeling this way makes you a stalker and a creep but who is it that says you have to know a person X amount of time before feeling this way? Humans make up all those rules and the rules are just what the people who make them up say they are. We're all different.

Every reason for leaving is based in fear. You're afraid she couldn't possibly feel the same intensity as you as you do for her. You're afraid you'll allow her to ruin the life you've built. You're afraid it will wreck your emotions for the rest of your life. And so on.   
  
Have you considered the good? She may not feel the same as you, but she can still fall in love with you. Set boundaries for yourself to maintain your life even while in a relationship. See a therapist if you have to, they are good at helping sort through confusing emotions. This is a chance to move forward and grow.

If he apologizes and respects your boundaries then what he said was likely just out of frustration but you shouldn't apologize.
