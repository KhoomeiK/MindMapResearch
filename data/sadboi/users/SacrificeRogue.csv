nightwish,fn1tgvc,t3_fycpbo,1586569713.0,"The problem for me right now is that I had the brilliant idea of trying to listen to this album while I'm ridiculously tired, so nothing's really sticking. That's my bad. But here are some thoughts anyway:

First off, as someone that has always been fond of animals and conservation and panics at the thought of extinction, I love the collaborations with the World Land Trust for Ad Astra and Procession.

So far, Procession, Endlessness, and How's the Heart stick out the most. 

I've had Noise and Harvest on repeat for a while now. Noise honestly made me rethink my entire existence and how we navigate through life, while Harvest makes me feel like it's okay to be a miniscule, pretty insignificant speck in the grand scheme of the universe. Which is a big deal for me because I am full of constant existential dread. Lol And for that reason, I can already tell that How's the Heart is going to be a source of comfort for me. 

So I waited the whole album for Marko to have a moment to shine vocally so when Endlessness played I was like ""Yes! My man! ...why does it sound like he's being held back?"" He has a gorgeous clean voice and his growly voice is iconic. But his singing in Endlessness sounds like it can't decide if it wants to be clean or growly and it's slightly off-putting? But that's probably because I'm used to him singing in The Islander or I Wish I Had an Angel and not much in the middle. Just threw me off guard, I guess. 

This album is definitely gonna take a few listens to fully digest and I'm okay with that. Gonna wait for my insomnia to inconveniently wake me back up in a few hours and give it a second listen. Lol This feels like a ""i have a restlessness in my soul that I can't put words to and it's 2am"" kind of album.

In the meantime, if Nuclear Blast could ship my CD that I ordered 3 months ago THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I don't care if coronavirus has delayed shipping. I am impatient and needy. Chop chop."

depression,fesmzv8,t1_ferpad1,1579366957.0,"The founder of To Write Love On Her Arms did an AMA this past fall and I asked him what one should do in the event that a parent refuses to listen to their child about mental health and just dismisses them. (I.e. my dad just avoiding the fact that I've had depression my whole life and never doing anything about it.) And he basically said ""that's a tough one. Probably should go see a mental health professional to untangle that."" So yeah, a professional is gonna be able to actually help you make progress. But I think a lot of the people here in these comments just want a tiny bit of empathy. 

I really don't expect my dad to understand what depression is like. But he never even tried to listen. He just shrugged it off as nothing because yeah, he's not equipped to deal with it. But instead of maybe having me see a professional who is equipped, he just ignored it. And when you're a minor (in America, i dunno how it is in the rest of the world) in that situation, you're kinda stuck.

So yeah, there comes a point where you should seek out a professional if you're able to. (Therapy is expensive here). They'll be able to actually help you make sense of your brain. But having someone in your life (friends, family, etc) that tells you ""i don't get this at all, but i care and am here to listen"" can help tremendously.

I've tried telling him a few times over the past, i dunno, 10-ish years that I have depression and everytime he says ""no you don't"" and ""get over yourself."" And he has such a dominating personality and I'm so timid that I can't get my thoughts together quick enough to try and explain to him what's going on.

I'd pay attention to external factors that might make your brain fog worse. Like just notice that you're in a deep fog and look around and see where you're at. Sounds. Lights. Smells. Outside or inside. Etc etc. 

Certain types of lighting will fuck with me. Like harsh department store fluorescent lights and some classrooms that use similar lighting. It's weird and I don't get why it does that, but my brain just shuts off like it's being overstimulated when all I could be doing is grabbing a gallon of milk or sitting in class. 

That and droning noises from machines also mess with me. I recently was waiting for pizza takeout and the restaurant had both that harsh lighting and all their fridges, ovens, machines, whatever made constant loud droning sounds. This was a pretty small building, too, which made the sounds worse. It was overstimulating like crazy. I was either gonna have a panic attack or my brain was gonna shut down into a foggy dissociative state. I had to leave my boyfriend inside to pick up our order while I waited in the car. 

But just knowing that something externally is messing with me helps calm my anxiety because I know that once I'm away from there for a while, I'll start to feel a little more like myself."

Might sound dumb and obvious, but a consistent diet might help whether you feel hungry or not. Take a day to meal prep for the week, so when it's time for dinner you don't look in the fridge and go ""nah, i don't feel like making anything."" 

To be fair, I don't do this. It just sounds like a good idea, maybe. Cuz depression makes me have very little appetite and I'm already on the small side, so when i do get my appetite back I feel dizzy and sick. 

And i wonder why I feel like ass all the time. Lol

So yeah. It's eyeroll-worthy advice, but food does also play a part in fatigue. And the other thing with depression (especially if you have depression and anxiety) is that it makes things feel really overwhelming, so tackling all the things you just listed at the same time probably won't work very well. Anytime I try and make a bunch of changes to my life, I lose motivation in like a day. So I'd focus on making one change, like getting your meals sorted out, and focus on that long enough that it becomes more of a habit. Then you can tackle whatever the next step is for you."
