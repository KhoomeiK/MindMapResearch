bipolar,fks99gh,t1_fks3q4c,1584484997.0,"It’s tough to navigate, and I must be honest I haven’t always been successful at it. It’s been rare that I’ve been paranoid-jealous, but it’s definitely made me lash out toward my SO in the past, sometimes rationally and sometimes irrationally. Unfortunately I was undiagnosed/I medicated then. The only serious relationship I’ve had since I was diagnosed taught me a lot though! I did have issues with paranoia and jealousy, but I spoke with him about it openly and calmly. Fortunately he was also medicated bipolar and able to help me see that the thoughts I was having was irrational. He was a loyal boyfriend and treated me like a queen, I just needed to understand that he needed space more than I did. If he turned over to sleep “too soon” after cuddling, I would remind myself he’s just tired and ready to fall asleep. If he didn’t return my call for a couple hours, he was busy with work since he often worked 60+ hours. It’s important to see it’s *our* insecurities we project onto others when we are being paranoid and jealous. It’s *our* shit we need to work on. We can do that by changing the way we think, and countering paranoid/jealous thoughts with rational ones. 

Side note, it sounds like your situation with your ex was incredibly stressful due to outside factors. 17.5 hours out of your day was dedicated to a new job *and* you’re living in a new city. Sometimes we need to take a step back and see how there are a lot of factors beyond our control that can negatively contribute to the relationship. It’s not all our fault.

[As far as boundaries, I suggest reading this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/8rxuaf/if_you_are_the_person_dating_a_person_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Edit: if you speak openly and calmly when you start having paranoid-jealous feelings then that can help stop the anger from building. If you let it fester and the anger build, then you will be more prone to outbursts. Open communication is key to prevent anger and paranoia from spiraling out of control."

I think the fact that you are analyzing yourself to make sure you're not being manic/hypomanic is great.

bipolar,fkrpbo1,t1_fkrk60j,1584473343.0,"“Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too. We asked [a higher power]  to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend. When a person offended us we said to ourselves, “This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? Save me from being angry. Thy will be done.” 

“Please help me to be free of anger and to see that the world and its people have dominated me. Show me that the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, has the power to actually kill me.” 
We need to work on our resentments so we can have peace ourselves. It’s imperative.

I’ve struggled to keep going when my family and friends judgement is clear, but I also remind myself that only my higher power can judge me. You are strong enough to have self-respect and pride, despite the judgements you face, if you actively seek to live a spiritually sound life. If you keep your side of the street clean then you’ve done all you can. That should hopefully provide you with a sense of self worth, it has at least for me in my experience.

Godspeed, my fellow."

bipolar,fkrgsy1,t1_fkremgr,1584468583.0,"Hi friend, my psychiatrist told me rapid cycling is common for those starting medication again, and having that self-knowledge certainly helped me (although it still majorly sucks). It’s a bit strange because I was in your situation about 3 weeks ago. 

First off, cut out the self-degrading comments. It’s no easy feat, but believe that you can do it. No matter what your depression says it’s *lying* to you. Tell yourself this, reassure yourself this. Imagine yourself as a warrior and you’re fighting off the self-depreciating thoughts, because, in fact, you ARE a warrior. You’re fighting to give yourself the shred of normalcy you deserve. 

Secondly, when you’re starting medication you *have* to remind yourself that it takes time and that it’s *okay* you’re not where you want to be at. Progress not perfection.

Lastly, might I suggest writing about how you are actively overcoming your struggles in life? Because you are and any education admission committee would be delighted to see that. It shows that you are tough, know when to ask for help, and that you have perseverance. It shows that you would make a fine addition.

P.S. I can certainly help you with editing if you’d like."
bipolar,fkrcx7w,t1_fkrblxa,1584466368.0,"Great question. It’s never an over night thing and something that takes progress in my experience. I want to be gentle with myself and practice self forgiveness, but I also don’t want to get into the toxic mindset, “well it’s only cause I’m Bipolar, it’s not actually my fault,” which is avoiding responsibility all together.

If I need to make amends (not *just* say sorry) for an episode, then I work with my therapist on how I should go about it. That certainly has helped with the shame. Most people are 100% forgiving, go figure! And those who aren’t? I tried my best to make my side of the street clean and that’s all I can do.

As far as confidence goes? The longer I stay in therapy and take my medication the more confidence I have gained. I am able to look at myself objectively and learn from past episodes. Self-knowledge is sexy baby! And when I’m feeling sexy I’m feeling confident.

Edit: more often than not I need to make amends to myself. I work on that with my therapist as well."

bipolar,fkbd0pp,t1_fkbc3ei,1584030722.0,"Got it. The following info might be useful to you then, my friend. 

Am I having a hypomanic episode checklist: 

4 days or more and I experience 3 or more of the following 7 symptoms each day, it’s clearly hypomania:

* Grandiosity.
* Decreased need for sleep.
* More talkative.
* Rapid Ideas.
* Distractibility.
* Increased goal-seeking behavior. 
* Risky behavior 

Am I having a manic episode checklist:

3 or more for a week or more of the same symptoms as hypomania, but at least one of the following symptoms is present during that week:

* Distinguished impairment of social/occupational functioning.
* Psychotic features.
* On the brink of hospitalization. (I.E. needing a severe amount of nervous symptoms depressants)

Am I having a depressive episode checklist:

5 or more of the following for at least two weeks, and either the first symptom or second is present throughout both weeks:

* Depressed mood.
* Diminished interest/ pleasure in almost all activities.
* Significant weight change or appetite disturbance.
* Sleep disturbance (insomnia or hypersomnia).
* Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
* No energy.
* Feelings of worthlessness.
* Decreased ability to think, concentrate; indecisive. 
* Persistent suicidal thoughts 

The symptoms need to cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

FYI this is all from the DSM-5. I got my undergrad in psych so I think it’s made me more prone to trying to evaluate myself from a clinical perspective. It helps me realize that I can thoroughly enjoy hypomanic symptoms (if less than 4 days), and get through the depressive ones (if less than 2 weeks.) If I’m having an episode it’s time to get back to the doctor and adjust my meds."
