BravoRealHousewives,foowq1r,t1_fomksg0,1587948079.0,"So I’m rewatching RHOBH. I have always felt that Kyle tried to paint LVP as the manipulator when in reality it was her. My mom and I argue about it all the time because she believes Kyle is a saint. During the Tea Party episode of S2, When the focus switches from Lisa having a “huge ego” to Taylor’s marriage, Taylor says “why is this about my marriage? This was supposed to be about Lisa.”  And everything clicked. Kyle has always wanted to be the “Queen B” and when she realized how popular LVP was she couldn’t stand it. I mean it’s crazy that it started as early as season 2. Kyle continuously grouped women together to try to attack Lisa and it has always failed, up until puppy gate. On the same episode when Taylor is at the gate with Paul she says “they all said they would have my back.” Clearly this was a preplanned attack. I’m so glad you posted this because I’m so tired of the LVP is a villain narrative while Kyle is the perfect wife and mother."

I am actually on the other end of a situation like this right now, but I’ve been on your end as well. I can tell you from experience, it does push people away. As sad as it is to say, people grow apart. I’m not saying that’s the case with all friendships, but sometimes a friendship might just need a break. 
I was friends with someone for over 10 years and when I noticed that she was distancing herself from me I pushed her away. Now we see each other every once in awhile and it’s normal and it goes back to how it used to be. There are so many other people out there that will care for you the way you care for them. A length of a friendship shouldn’t be a reason for you to put up with them ditching you or making you feel insignificant. I struggled with this for a few years, I wanted my childhood friends to stay my best friends because that’s what we always promised each other.  Until I realized I felt like I was begging for a minute of their time just because they were so important to me. I learned it’s best to not hold on so tightly, because it does push people away. And while you’re focusing on there friends that don’t value you for who you are, you’re losing sight of people that truly care and will meet your friendship needs. 
I hope this helps, if you need to talk feel free to reach out. Friendships are tough to let go of."

There’s no point in dealing with people that make you miserable."

FriendshipAdvice,fdg1ijr,t3_el73a2,1578376600.0,"I’ve dealt with a situation like this before. 
There are two options, one is ignore them.
Two (which is what I prefer) is tell them that you think you are just in two different places in life, it’s a nice way of saying you’ve outgrown one another. You may find a certain way to say it because you know more than I do on how this friend will respond to thing. Ending a friendship is a lot like a breakup. I don’t recommend telling them everything that’s wrong with y’all’s friendship or anything that will make it end on a bad note.
Best of luck! It’s hard to break-up with friends, but if it’s toxic it’s worth it."

BeautyGuruChatter,fclb1xq,t3_egp5nh,1577743711.0,"My cousins and I are going on a trip for one of my cousins birthday. I'm bestfriends with my cousins so we hang out with the same group. We needed an extra person after someone backed out so I invited our friend H on the trip, because she knows the hosts and she gets along with everyone.  Well, our friend A started freaking the fuck out because she wasn't invited. 

A doesn't know the hosts of the trip that well, it's the bday boy and his GF.  She BEGGED the hosts to invite her when we weren't in the room... they said there wasn't any room left so they thought she would drop it, but she kept insisting. Saying "" I have the money RIGHT NOW. I can send it, RIGHT NOW."" Like what on earth makes anyone think that is okay??? 

She brings it up to my cousin ""R,"" (we met A through R). and basically says she's so sad she wasn't invited and her feelings are hurt. mind you, this is for our COUSIN'S birthday. She even said ""it's pretty close to my birthday."" trying to make my cousin's trip about her? 

A week passes, THEN she corners my cousin  K (part of the friend group)  and talks about how upset she is that she isn't invited/going. K  is like ""dang i'm sorry it's not my trip.."" So at this point you would think she would get it.. but NO. She texts R AGAIN  and says she is thinking of getting an Air B&B on the same weekend because she wants to go SO badly. Finally R just tells her that she's making it really uncomfortable because she's trying to force herself into our cousin's trip. It's not personal, it's just not our trip to invite people on. 

Sounds like an entitled teenager right? Wrong, she's almost 30. 

Just had to let that out lol"

You deserve so much better. I can tell you really loved her and I just can’t express how sorry I am. She doesn’t deserve you, you will find someone better down the line.  Just take your time to heal and process what has happened and STAY STRONG. Cheaters are manipulative and will convince you to stay.

I’ve never been offended by his comments during his podcasts, but disturbed, definitely. But I think that ties into the human curiosity theory that he touched base on.

I hope the show does get better and I hope Mike becomes a little more sensitive to listeners. I know his style is very unfiltered and at times it is witty, but I do understand why others do get offended.  I enjoy his podcast because it gives me goosebumps and creeps me out. It’s one of my favorite crime podcasts and I listen to several.
