However, originally I chose UCI over UCSD but that was because of my major, but now I’m going to Berkeley. So decide on which campus you think you’d like and research the programs regarding your major. :)) I wish you the best of luck. Both schools are outstanding!"

I am planning on pre-med and I feel that UCI may be more beneficial for me when med school application time comes around. If you don’t mind, what school do you plan on attending? If Irvine, why?

So now I’m not too sure if I want to attend Irvine anymore. This is surely tough. I think for me.. ultimately it comes down to location. :,) May I also ask how have you enjoyed your time at Berkeley?
