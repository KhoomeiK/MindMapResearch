schizoaffective,fr35ykb,t1_fr352k1,1589850620.0,Well with me I get worked up when bed time comes and never sleep. It's like mania but not quite. My doctor has me taking otc sleeping pills nightly for it because they seem to help.

anime,fr1r4bi,t3_gm6cu6,1589824523.0,Yea you know your in for some trash after the first episode. It's enertaining though.
anime,fqyh2tu,t1_fqyg6bj,1589748473.0,Under 200. The original was 250-300. I guess this release doesn't come w OST.
schizoaffective,fqsbjou,t3_gkmgby,1589602985.0,I was kind of in the same boat as you. On a low dose meds thinking about work and then I relapsed. I'm on triple dose meds and pretty useless again. Be safe and maybe try part time first.
anime,fqqho39,t3_gke0c7,1589565689.0,Definitely. I listened to other people and didn't watch it. Big regret. It's pretty good.

fatestaynight,fqq4glj,t3_gkarpz,1589559234.0,Lol. I dunno. I started with zero. Can't complain really. The spoiled parts weren't a big deal to me.
anime,fqllte1,t3_gjl8go,1589461270.0,Watches half the show. Comes to Reddit to post how overrated the series is. You do you my man.
anime,fqlg5ia,t3_gjdx0y,1589457164.0,"I watched whole thing. It was great. I actually think the cgi backgrounds look really nice, the fight scenes are pretty fluid. What I hate are the character models. You get use to it but I feel like I'm playing a ps2 game."
schizoaffective,fqle84r,t1_fqjq85w,1589455513.0,About 3 months. I went from 250 to 210. I eat about 1200-1300 calories a day.
anime,fqigdk8,t1_fqig4ju,1589395637.0,The first release was 250 at least..
schizoaffective,fqfmkf9,t3_gimuay,1589327614.0,"You got to eat less no matter how many ways you want to slice it. You could change up your foods go low carb or keto or you can simply eat less of what your eating. At the end of the day your going to have to consume less calories. I get it. Hunger pains, getting hangry but it doesn't last. After a few weeks your body adapts to less food. I had a lot of luck with 18:6 fasting. I lost 35 pounds doing that. I still do it, give or take an hour or two. I started exercising recently and to be honest I have not lost a pound yet from it. I do 45min power walks."
anime,fqfjmuo,t3_gimzrz,1589326086.0,I watched airing order. Seems like a safe bet.
Coronavirus,fqe63x0,t3_gidw2h,1589302360.0,Gotta go gym and slave so you can sit on couch and watch Netflix afterwards with your big muscles.
trackers,fqdq68p,t3_gib54l,1589294645.0,That's wierd. I never got one from a private tracker before and I been at this 8 years. I don't even get them from IPT. I did get them on public trackers though.
swordartonline,fqdlrth,t3_gibsmo,1589292289.0,I have not seen anything either. It seems a lot of live action anime gets announced but you never hear about it again. Like the steins gate live action too lol.
evangelion,fqa5eqi,t3_ghq67z,1589213134.0,I thought this was a shit post. Thanks for laugh.
schizoaffective,fq7uso7,t1_fq7ud3c,1589152645.0,Sleep is my only escape most of the time. Each day is hit or miss.
anime,fq7mc0e,t3_ghag99,1589148309.0,I want to eat your pancreas is pretty feely.
schizoaffective,fq7lzgn,t3_gh93be,1589148170.0,I think it gets better over time for sure but your not going to be the same as you used to be. Your going to have to accept that.

anime,fq68erz,t3_gh2z9r,1589126575.0,Yea OP was fire. The animation was pretty bad but I still watched it.
schizoaffective,fq3iqqt,t1_fq3hxne,1589066884.0,I don't think so the Geodon actually makee the feeling go away. But it still comes every evening. I remember feeling this way when I was psychotic on different meds. It's a feeling that comes with psychosis. It's a very dark feeling which is why sometimes I think I'm in hell already.
anime,fq3i9ww,t3_ggpwwa,1589066742.0,Oh I think it's great. It aired on TV for such a long time. Basically it's just getting old. I bought the physical release. I enjoy the hell out of it.
schizoaffective,fq39a7e,t3_ggeuk0,1589064199.0,"I'm struggling. I've had panic attacks and anxiety for 2 months now. A few days ago delusions started coming back from my hospitalization 3 years ago. My doctor tripled my Geodon dose and while it does help I feel like I am dying. I guess I'm grateful I escaped another hospitalization but at the same time I still feel very scared and awful. I feel like I'm in hell but I'm hoping the feeling goes away soon. If you can imagine death in your head, that's what I feel like. 2020 has been pretty dogshit so far. I'm in my mid 30's now and I thought I would be free from this illness but I guess I still have it. I wish you all good health and hopefully there will be something positive this year."
anime,fpote3i,t3_gepppi,1588790336.0,I liked Zegapain and RahXephon a lot. Definitely check those out if you have not.
fatestaynight,fpkqirm,t3_ge0yne,1588699284.0,I personally watched UBW first and Heavens feel first and went back to watch Fate stay night 2006. I love it. The first few episodes are similar to UBW then the story diverges into its own thing. It was a fun watch.
anime,fpk9pxi,t3_gdyf8a,1588690682.0,Phantom Requiem
shieldbro,fpge0da,t3_gdbuk6,1588600752.0,Is really good
anime,fpg5x6o,t3_gd4tux,1588595156.0,The MC from Gleipnir is top tier bitch. Emiya is pretty tolerable compared to him.

fatestaynight,fpbqp80,t3_gcf3yp,1588476340.0,I don't get the hate. I thought it was pretty good. I'm a big fan of early 2000's anime though.
anime,fp4aags,t3_gb8bm6,1588294833.0,"""100x worse"". Man your totally missing out. Thank God I don't listen to others opinions. If you like FATE what is stopping you from watching a few episodes? UBW is great. Heaven's feel is great. Fate Stay Night is pretty good."
anime,fp34o4j,t3_gb1mth,1588273022.0,I think the animation looks low budget but the art style is cool. I watch a lot of seasonal anime so I'm use to everything not being beautiful.
anime,fp337ic,t3_gb1bvc,1588272312.0,It's 2020. Can we move on from the big 3?
fatestaynight,fow2z5o,t3_g9whew,1588112051.0,I'm sure more seasoned fans have their takes but I did fate / zero first just like you. The only thing that really spoiled me was Rin and Sakura. Heaven's feel is its own route so the story is very different from fate zero. I don't think you should be too upset about it.
anime,fov4qn0,t3_g9qgha,1588095355.0,You might like blade of the Immortal. It was a dark gore fest. Fate/Zero was pretty dark at times. People already say Devilman Crybaby. That's probably the closest thing to what you looking for. It's hard to match Texhnolyze.
anime,fopacto,t3_g8sbnm,1587956647.0,"Bruh. It's nothing like Darwin's game. Maybe you thinking of the fate stay night routes, those are actually battle royals. If you want to start grand order watch ""First Order"" or play the games ""epilogue""."
Coronavirus,fol9md4,t3_g7uiku,1587857625.0,Man I have anxiety really bad and my mental illness acting up but I rescheduled all my doctor appointments a few months out. It's just not worth catching the virus from the doctors office. I'm gonna have to go in at some point I just hope the situation improves before then.
anime,foe7gnk,t1_foe3269,1587697569.0,"It's a whole different story really. I put it off for so long because people said it was bad and it actually became one of my favorites. I did zero , ubw, and heavens feels first."
anime,fo9t4xo,t3_g6idlw,1587630244.0,People are dumb man. If it doesn't tickle their pickle within the first episode they will drop it and come to the internet to complain.
candy,fo5q1d4,t3_g5usya,1587532205.0,Albanese gummy worms are pretty good. Pretty reasonable prices online. I'm sure the bears are probably good too.
candy,fo1relq,t3_g56r0l,1587439741.0,Better variety than the giant bag. The giant bag is mostly orange and red with very few pink and yellow.
anime,fo0p3wc,t3_g512rj,1587417158.0,Lol. First world problems.
swordartonline,fo0oxnw,t3_g5137y,1587417066.0,Nice. I have them all too but didn't get the luxery of the discounted box sets. Original release of SAO 1 and 2 was around 250$ each just like SAO 3 is now :)
anime,fnzmwx4,t3_g4o95o,1587397095.0,Let's hope the writing is still good because the visuals are pretty bad.
anime,fnxeypz,t3_g4gp1l,1587337248.0,Gurren is a classic and fire force has great animation. Both are fun. I noped out of black clover. It also has 100+ episodes.
schizoaffective,fnxddf2,t3_g4gfsn,1587336352.0,It's pretty common delusion.. thinking you faked it or your perfectly fine. Your not really going to fool the doctors though. It's pretty common to get sent home when your not 100%. If your not a danger to yourself or others and treatment has begun working you will be released.
candy,fnw6p9f,t3_g43x0y,1587312522.0,You can order a big bag from oh nuts! but that candy is way too disgustingly sweet for me. I feel like I'm eating raw sugar.
omad,fnu9q7r,t3_g3y9vs,1587257457.0,It was rough for me the first two weeks but you get use to it. You could try doing a 20:4 or 18:6 intermittent fast. That's how I started. It's easier and still produces results.
anime,fnu4ztb,t3_g3xvgh,1587254660.0,Yea. My favorite anime style is from 2000-2010. I like the art style and general production.
schizoaffective,fnqchwh,t1_fnq72mm,1587161933.0,True. I eat once a day usually and just take it then. 300-500 calories is ok. I usually eat 1100 at once so not big deal.
anime,fnq2szb,t3_g36r4q,1587156602.0,The last episode release got really interesting. Not a huge fan of fan service but it is what it is.
schizoaffective,fnq05ca,t1_fnpuqfh,1587155185.0,I am better on Geodon.
schizoaffective,fnpix6u,t1_fnow6ph,1587146296.0,"It made my negative symptoms very bad. I would lay down in bed, stare at the wall for hours and pray for death. This was after a long time of no problems though."
schizoaffective,fnov4p5,t3_g33326,1587134185.0,Hmm. I don't think you can avoid the flatness in AP's but everyone is different. Proloxin was very nice to me at first. After about 2 years I felt so bad on it I had to switch. It is low weight gain though.
omad,fnnumed,t3_g2vbgo,1587102223.0,Nah. Just go jogging or exercise at home. It's never to early to make better food choices too.
anime,fnmwclx,t3_g2pz57,1587079434.0,There's a reason it's a huge franchise in Japan. I think it's far from boring but fate/zero does start off with an info dump. You kind of need to know that info though. I too started with Zero and I don't regret it. I think it's very solid.
fatestaynight,fnmjxoy,t3_g2o079,1587072777.0,"Nah, your going to want to watch zero first."
omad,fnluqgh,t3_g2jvax,1587060062.0,"Sounds about right. I eat about 1300 a day and I'm a 5'10"" 210lb male. I think some people on here are either very short or have eating disorder. I try to take it with a grain of salt. You can get away with a few sub 1000 calorie meals for a short period of time too. We just don't see the whole picture unfortunately."
disability,fnldkei,t3_g1zg9n,1587051665.0,If someone claimed you as a dependent you won't get it.
omad,fnl7f5r,t3_g2g7d1,1587048435.0,"A lot. It's CICO at the end of the day. If your not losing you definitely want to visit how many calories your eating. After you calorie count for a while you get good at estimating in your head, so it's not really a big deal."
omad,fninf0d,t3_g1zuop,1586983024.0,I personally think you would get the same results. It's CICO at the end of the day. There are some health benefits to fasting though.
candy,fng7ktp,t3_g1khs2,1586924279.0,I've been kind of disappointed with everything starburst that's not a fruit chew. Maybe I will try these if I can find them.
schizoaffective,fnesp50,t3_g1ckpd,1586895167.0, It's pretty normal for it to take a few weeks to work. It's that way with most psych meds. I don't think there is a magic bullet.
schizophrenia,fncbptz,t3_g0wyne,1586832951.0,It felt like that for me but after years of disability and medication I feel like I have improved from my original state. I'm actually returning to work at the end of the year. I still have problems but not anywhere near as bad as it use to be. Maybe you will improve over time too.
anime,fncb0yr,t3_g0wra5,1586832514.0,"There's good dubs, passable dubs, and bad dubs."
stimuluscheck,fnc930c,t3_g0v3bf,1586831272.0,Yea. I'm kind of done checking my account. I'm just waiting for the get payment portal. I have no idea if someone claimed me as a dependent or not for the years they are going off of.
anime,fnc6pig,t3_g0w5xd,1586829787.0,Oh yea I eat this edgy trashy stuff up. I needed a replacement for Darwin's game this season and this is perfect.
fatestaynight,fnb8ul6,t3_g0q88m,1586811249.0,I don't know. I put it off for so long and I'm enjoying every bit of it. Maybe I have nostalgia for early 2000's anime but I love it's style. I am an anime only though.
schizoaffective,fnb80o8,t3_g0j1fa,1586810829.0,"No. I will be too lol. Ain't nobody interested in me. I guess part of the problem is I stay at home, so it's not like I'm putting myself out there. I hate the whole idea of modern dating, where you date as many people possible and eventually land on ""the one"". It seems like a rediculous concept to me. Maybe things will change when I go back to work at the end of the year, who knows."
anime,fnb6r9q,t3_g0o4ln,1586810196.0,I think JoJo's is bad. I'm middle way through part 3 and I just don't get it. I love the fashion and the style but the plot is cringe. Sorry JoJo fans. I'm going to finish it one day just to say I've seen it all.
stimuluscheck,fnb1lwg,t1_fnb0u2s,1586807628.0,"it should, but in case you don't receive it that IRS tool is coming out on the 17th to show you your refund status."
anime,fn9nntu,t3_g0hb0g,1586779518.0,I'm looking forward to the remake. I tried watching the old one twice but ended up dropping it. Maybe try a few episodes of the old one to see if you like it.
shieldbro,fn97a21,t3_g0aymm,1586761925.0,I just got the regular edition pre-ordered. I have never really been a fan of Funimation LE's. I am happy Funimation is releasing it though.
schizoaffective,fn7b25o,t3_g012pg,1586716805.0,"Yea best to find a better medication. I gained 60pounds on Zyprexa. It made me eat all freaking day. It was REAL hunger too, the kind if you don't get food you going to feel like your going to die. Ask for Geodon. You could even try something old school like haldol or fluphenazine. Those all have low weight gain chances."
anime,fn54iey,t3_fznkix,1586655730.0,Maybe AoT. Everyone is at a different point in their anime journey and frankly some of us just have poor taste.
stimuluscheck,fn4s2ml,t3_fzc5z4,1586647741.0,I'm waiting for the 17th for that portal they are supposedly making that tells the status of your stimulus check. I didn't receive anything yet. I didn't really expect us to be in the first wave though.
evangelion,fn29qnw,t3_fywkca,1586581897.0,Bootlegs suck man. Not worth it.
candy,fn235vz,t3_fyufgk,1586576608.0,At the gas station here in southern USA there is starburst tropical and starburst reds (an assortment of pink and reds). There is also the starburst mini's but those taste like ass.
anime,fmwyugd,t3_fxvudt,1586455440.0,People like to dog on 2006 sometimes but as a fate fan I think it is a must see. It's really done well. I just started watching it myself and was expecting it to be bad and I was very surprised at how good it is. I'm ashamed I put it off for so long..
anime,fmvrfcg,t3_fxq1f8,1586428033.0,"The manga is definitely better and goes way beyond the anime, but if your just looking for some edgy gorey shit to watch then I definitely recommend the anime. Gantz:O the animated cgi movie is a good watch too."
anime,fmqpm9y,t3_fwt4sh,1586304364.0,Yea the show is mostly positive. The character development is great.
schizophrenia,fmqoc8w,t3_fwvcwq,1586303611.0,The gift of suffering.
disability,fmq7ztd,t3_fwsru4,1586294582.0,My doctor wants me to return to some form of work. Then covid happened. Sorry fam I'm not working this year. I have pre-existing conditions. I'm going to isolate until this is all over. I might pick up part time work in winter. I am hoping the worst will be over by then.
Coronavirus,fmm24s0,t1_fmlum5g,1586197378.0,It's not all doom and gloom yet. We will see in a month.
anime,fmh5zpo,t3_fv8s03,1586067870.0,Attack on Titan for sure.
anime,fmh5l50,t3_fv8v5w,1586067485.0,I like the way it looks as in the style but I feel like the animation itself is lacking. I'm in it for the story though. I watch seasonals with questionable animation all the time.
candy,fmgye8u,t3_fv77mj,1586061234.0,Hmm sour jolley ranchers. They are not like warheads but they are tart and stay tart. Might scratch the itch. Tbh your asking for too much because outside of warheads and toxic waste there is nothing as sour.
anime,fmadu5k,t3_fu202f,1585890947.0,"Nah. Most anime I watch is in the 7 range. I choose my shows carefully and I follow through and watch the whole thing. I'm very positive though when it comes to anime though, I generally like what I see and I don't get butt hurt if it didn't strike my fancy."
disability,fm8p64k,t3_ftrupm,1585853447.0,Yes. According to the IRS update you will not have to do anything.
