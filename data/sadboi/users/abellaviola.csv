I had a lil' chihuahua mix forced on me a few years ago, and I did so much research into how to raise him to make sure he's not a stereotypical angry little bastard. Turns out its really not that hard. I'm lucky that my little boy is mixed with a min-pin and seems to be easy to train, but I just made sure to use positive reinforcement and spend the time to bond with him so that he trusts me completely, and train him so that he knows exactly what to do when I say it. I know my dogs body language and I never set him up to fail. And he is such a good boy. 

I know I'm probably bragging about him too much, but the other day he thoroughly impressed me. We were at the dog park and he was being his normal crazy self, and a little kid bolted up to him to pet him. I freaked the fuck out because he is not a fan of kids, I think they freak him out because hes never been around them. But he wasn't aggressive, he immediately laid down and showed his belly (and peed on himself a little) and when the kid bent down to touch him he raced back to me and climbed up my leg so I would pick him up. I thought for sure that the kid was going to be nipped, but my pup proved to me that our training was worth it."
