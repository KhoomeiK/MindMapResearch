SexPositive,fnkeyyc,t3_g29dah,1587024540.0,"I had sex on acid once and it was completely mind blowing. Make sure you've got music playing, for sure, and that your area is comfortable. When we started peaking, we were laying on top of each other completely clothed, just touching, and it felt like I was orgasming over and over again. And we were like, shit, if it's this amazing clothed and we're not even having sex, what if we actually have sex?? Make sure to be patient cause erections are hard to get, but it's definitely incredible. Forms a really deep bond too that I was not expecting"

AskReddit,f45alcv,t3_djabmx,1571370461.0,"I had a lot of anxiety as a teenager and was too scared to try it when all my friends started drinking because I was afraid of not being in control, or doing something stupid, or just the new experience in general, or just afraid of looking dumb because I didn't know anything about alcohol or drinking. Eventually became that ""straight edge friend"" not because I wanted to, but I was just trapped in that role by my friends which made me more anxious because if I ever wanted to, I know they'd make a big deal out of it.  
Took me moving to a different state, getting new friends who didn't know I was like that, growing some nerve, and allowing myself to not know things to finally try it"

You look amazing and this makes me feel so much better. I often feel like I'm doing it wrong because so many of these posts are about losing weight, it makes me feel bad to step on the scale and see it go up even though I've been working out so much. Thank you for posting :)"

Anxiety,eo8f3uy,t3_bqqlfw,1558365031.0,"I recently deleted my Facebook because I have this same issue. Every time I'd post or comment anything, I'd just overthink it and imagine what anybody would judge me for about it and how it's probably not funny, or just a waste of time, or whoever's post I commented on doesn't know me like that, etc. Deleted all my comments and posts minutes after. It feels so shallow scrolling and only being able to react on posts because your anxiety mind prison won't allow you to participate in socializing. Deleting Facebook freed me from a little anxiety but I hope I can overcome this fear and go back to it healthily one day. I have the same issue with reddit but I'm working on it too; the anonymity helps"
