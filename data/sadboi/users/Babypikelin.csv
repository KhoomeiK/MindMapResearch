introverts,flnu1cx,t3_fpxf40,1585325866.0,"It's just me and my partner but we live in a teeny tiny flat. He's usually at work during the day giving me 10 hours to myself. But now I constantly have someone around and some kind of noise going on. I also have ptsd which means I can't relax when another human is around even if their ""safe"".   We're still figuring out what will work but so far him taking the dog for a walk once a day gives me enough time to meditate, do some qi gong and have that lovely silence I need to relax. Having a hour long salt bath whilst meditating and reading every so often helps. I also think agreeing to no tv/music/gameing before lunch time is also helping me. 
We can't be in seperate rooms but his computer is positioned so he is facing away from me so that helps section him off to that side of the room a bit.
 I'm very grateful he's here but the sudden change is very uncomfortable and it's making me realise some things about myself that I need to work on which I'd rather just hide from, so that sucks to!
 Looking for others suggestions on this as the tension in my body from not having the alone time I'm used to is giving me migraines and a whole heap of body pain. But your not alone! Thanks for sharing, I've been looking for someone else in the same kind of position"

My trauma responses are also freeze and fawn when I'm unable flee. 
Thankyou for helping me feel less alone in this, it's an issue I feel very powerless over even after 3 years of therapy. Unfortunately my fiance doesn't quite understand how unsafe I feel on nights out so I'm on my own with this issue."
CPTSD,evs4toq,t3_cksh9k,1564729978.0,Thanks! Was clenched and didn't even realise!
