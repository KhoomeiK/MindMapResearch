Fleabag,f57gw17,t1_f56odms,1572035899.0,"Yes! I agree with this ""theory"" so much. Becoming a priest seems like it was his lifelong therapy that he *needed.* He tells fleabag he's had sex before her, indicating he's definitely been through enough in life to understand what he's getting himself into if he were to engage in acts with her. Him walking away from her was him preventing ultimate heartbreak for her and him. I think he knows himself enough to know what are the signs of him feeling like he's falling in love. Tbh I'm not sure if fleabag understands if shes in love or lust -- *looks at camera* \- unclear. 

Also your point about the drinking makes a lot of sense. There's a clear juxtaposition of when he's engaging in conversation with others versus when he just ""loses"" it with fleabag. He can't stop drinking or touching her when they're together. This show is just so great. I love it so much because of how real and raw everything feels. 

CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE SEES HER MIND DRIFT OFF TO TALK TO US!?!??!!?"

Perplexed, I looked at the screen realizing it was Season 2. Fuck it. Went back watched all of Season 1. Loved it. Then got back to Season 2 Episode 1 and had a newfound love for it all over again.

AskWomenOver30,f4n8vtu,t3_dl1rzb,1571686970.0,"Yes and no. I was around 22 at the time and dating someone about  3 years older than me. He was an amazing partner but had some downfalls, that at the time  I couldn't get over). He was the most loving person to me, but when it came to our future he was less stable. He often poured his entire paychecks into bitcoin and would be left with $20-$30 by the end of some weeks. I totally understood ""the why"" but I couldn't help that he didn't see how much he was burdening me to pay for things. About a year 2 months later, I had a huge mental breakdown and he couldn't take it so we broke up. I should add a major death also happened in this time frame -- his mom's bf, soon to be new husband.

I look at his instagram & twitter now and he is the CEO of two companies that he started from the ground up. He's making great money, currently travelling the world, attending conferences where he's becoming well known. He has a fiance now and looks happy. I'm not bitter about any of it, I just look at that and wish sometimes I could have been the girl with him. He made me insanely happy but I couldn't shake some things. I can't go back and I can't change his or my actions. What's done is done, and I definitely don't want to go back. I just kind of envy what could have been my future life with him. All this in a matter of 3-4 years...........sigh. I guess the lesson is patience is a virtue. That's why I'm trying my best to give my current partner the time they need to sort their stuff out.

I've been suffering from depression all my life, I've noticed the reason why my relationships didn't pan out the way I wanted was due to my depression putting a wall between me and SO. I HAD to figure out me, before I could give my all to someone else. My last SO said something profound to me that made me have my major wake-up call. He said ""I can't allow you to be co-dependent with me. If I did that, we'd both be in our worst places in life.""

If I'm being honest, the minute I heard those words, I nearly wanted to kill myself right there and then.....but then I realized how much that actually meant. He was saving me. He knew co-dependency was making me self implode and the only way to unleash happiness was to find it outside of my relationship.

DesignMyRoom,exiilei,t3_cszzlm,1566329069.0,"So I think the key thing I'm seeing here is that you and your husband like dark tones. Most people want a brighter open space which means adding more ""light and whites"" to the space, but I'm not sure your preference so I'll give options for both.

I think overall comments for your space is that you've got too many elements in the same tone, therefore making the space feel very dark overall. Both dark and light elements have their place, but it's using them strategically that's the trick.

**Keep the Dark:**

* Keep the dark blue and light blue accent walls
* For the dark blue wall
   * Use lighter/brighter colors here (whites with pops of color)
   * Declutter
   * Buy a nice sheet set in gray/lighter tones
   * Cover the window with light color curtains to conceal the air conditioner during the day, and easy access whenever.

**Go Lighter:**

* Repaint all walls white and keep 1 accent dark blue wall
* Use white pops of color against the dark blue wall
* Use black frames and darker accents on lighter wall.
* Use the rule of thumb dark on bottom to light on top when thinking about your space or vice versa. The contrast will give you the ""pop"" you're looking for.

**General DIY's/Changes**

* Repaint the side table and tall dresser to be either white or light grey
* Either get 1 new/thrifted  mirror that is a nice size or just choose 1 of your mirrors. No need for both next to each other.
* Get a cute hamper from Ross/Marshalls to make it less frumpy with the clothes hanging out
* Try to get your tv wall [to look like this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/391742867563303440/)... it'll make the space decluttered by keeping the PS4 and other consoles hidden inside
* Spray paint your cute decor to be 1 to 3 of the same colors. This makes your space feel ""put together"" because you're using the same tones. Example: spray paint vase, candle jars, etc etc."
DesignMyRoom,exhxwt3,t3_ct0gef,1566316720.0,"I would mount the TV like others have mentioned as it will take your eye up the wall. Center the TV to the white tv stand but don't let it go past the height of the black shelf on the left. Then I would probably move around the record player and cool clock you have to make a cool display on top of the white tv stand. Make it more of the focal point for that piece of furniture. I would also switch places with the lamp and guitar. I'd rather see the guitar as the feature piece than the lamp.
