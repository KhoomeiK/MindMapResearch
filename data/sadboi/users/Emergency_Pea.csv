reactivedogs,fpxrg19,t3_gg2mnx,1588988068.0,"This is just my personal experience with one training facility, I don’t mean to globalize, but I briefly worked as a kennel tech at a very popular board and train facility that used e-collars and I found what I saw pretty upsetting. Front end and in group classes the trainer seemed so caring and had what seemed like a solid explanation of why it’s a good training tool. Maybe for the right dog they can be, but I saw e-collars put on puppies and fearful dogs and it made me deeply uncomfortable. I remember seeing a newer trainer using an e-collar on a bull terrier puppy who was trembling and trying to hide, just zapping her over and over and asking the head trainer why it wasn’t working, which was pretty much my final straw there. 

Actually the final straw was when I was bit in the face, but I had been planning my exit anyways. It wasn’t a good place lol

ETA: when I say maybe for the right dog, I mean a very confident dog with a very proficient trainer in a very specific situation. I think the use of e-collars on fearful dogs is despicable."

Not too complicated, but she’s the only owner I’ve ever seen so that. In my experience a consistent routine and knowing what’s expected of them can make a huge difference for a dog, even just things like sitting at every door like you mentioned. 


I like to give my dogs little tasks when I’m doing stuff around the house, like carrying something around and following me. I also try to find little things to ask of them that I know would be mentally challenging for them - with my lab I like to have her stop and wait in the middle of the stairs, because she likes to barrel down them.

Also when I was first hired the staff had a collective habit of calling the dogs chickens. I’m now one of the only people remaining from that era and get weird looks for it.

Dogtraining,fi4xi46,t3_f6aluu,1582150441.0,"I’ll offer a more middle ground perspective on the collar/harness debate. 

My family’s lab was improperly trained when she was young. She became both a puller and a frustrated greeter who lunged towards other dogs. I started to crack down on her training when she was six, so it was a very ingrained habit by then. I tried SO many styles of no-pull harness and no matter how awkward it made it for her pull she still plowed ahead in them. 

A martingale collar has been by and large the most effective tool for us. Rather than making it difficult for her to pull it gives her clear physical stimulus that I could pair with a behavior. It can’t tighten enough to choke or hurt her unless she really lunges against it (I’ll get to that in a minute) but it gives her clear feedback. I worked with her the same way people have mentioned above, turning around each time I felt pressure on the leash, until feeling the collar start to tighten became her cue to stop and look at me. Getting to keep walking is her reward for loosening the leash. She figured it out pretty easily with a fabric martingale, but for some dogs one like [this](https://www.chewy.com/max-neo-dog-gear-martingale-chain-dog/dp/164028?utm_term&gclid=CjwKCAiA1rPyBRAREiwA1UIy8Hk8OQ7tcGs2eEjESxpkPax4bcdm65UPjkjYQsEOtuGxJDcdtjHVrBoCjM8QAvD_BwE&utm_campaign=hg&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google-product&utm_content=Max%20and%20Neo%20Dog%20Gear) that provides an audible cue as well is helpful. 

All that being said, I know she’s never gonna be perfect. Regular walks with the martingale are /always/ training walks and the goal is to push her threshold without putting her in situations where she would lunge, both for her safety and for the sake of our training. If we’re going on a hike or something, where I know she’ll be super stimulated and have more trouble keeping her focus on me I use the same commands/rewards and expect the same behavior but for her safety she wears a back clipping Ruffwear harness that won’t hurt her if she lunges.

I removed the clearly dead/very damaged leaves and got him back on a watering schedule of 1-2x a week, or when the soil feels dry up to my first knuckle, and was finally starting to see some new growth and healthy leaves - and then I left the window open on a 20 degree day and came home to a sad yellow plant :(. 

About half of his leaves right now look good - probably a quarter with no issues and a quarter that feel firm but have a bit of yellowing. The other half are partially or fully crispy/soft and wrinkled. On the bottom left of the picture you can see two in particular that seem okay near the stem but wrinkled on the top.

I’ve tried a lot of different things with my hair and I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m never gonna stick with anything more than, like, one product I can put in when it’s wet and air drying. 

I live in a very dry climate, in humidity I have full on curly, twisty hair which I love but I’ve never known how to deal with it here. This picture is right after a shower, and over the next day it falls flat but if I brush it it turns into a bush and doesn’t go down, so it’s straight but it just looks really bad. I keep it in a messy bun 90% of the time. 

It’s also bleached, but that hasn’t changed the texture much. My routine is pretty much no routine. I use sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner, usually a purple one of some sort, and the only way I’ve found my hair looks good down is if I get out of the shower and don’t touch it at all until it’s dry. Sometimes I’ll add a little leave-in conditioner on the ends. Everything else short of blow drying it just makes it worse, and honestly I’m never gonna blow dry it.

femalehairadvice,ffpu1tr,t1_ffpscwa,1580105709.0,Ty! I think about bangs sometimes but they scare me cause I’m worried they’d just make me go full baby face lol
femalehairadvice,ffprw98,t3_euji7k,1580103498.0,"This is my hair air dried, as in I toweled it off and didn’t touch it. Any attempt at styling and it falls straight, but in a weird way. It’s very thick and fine, and i can’t brush it without it going puffy and staticky. It also settles into all these weird cowlicks on the top of my head that make it impossible to put it in a ponytail or braid without lumps everywhere. I basically only wear it down right after a shower, and it goes in the same bun the rest of the time. 

Also a little bit of damage from bleach, it’s naturally dark and I’m going to start growing it back out so tips on how to do that gracefully would also be welcome!"

AskVet,feczp4r,t1_fecbkba,1578991440.0,Do you know what brand/where you can get these? I’ve been struggling to find boots that will stay on my poodle/Pom mix’s toothpick ankles

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaf8p4,t1_feaee30,1578947941.0,Box DNA test said Pomeranian x poodle. Those tests aren’t very reliable but I think it suits him haha
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,feaf5jv,t1_fea7mzn,1578947890.0,"Pomeranian x poodle, according to a box DNA test kit. Not totally reliable, but I go with it cause I think it’s funny"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9e2u3,t1_fe7drlr,1578936716.0,"funny enough mine would never share a bed! The big one isn’t a snuggler at all and likes to have her own space, so in her mind what they’re doing here is preferable to getting too close lmao"
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9d9sl,t1_fe9bd0m,1578936534.0,TOTALLY unbothered. He’s a little asshole. I love him.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe9d7ks,t1_fe8u8qr,1578936510.0,We’re actually super lucky with our setup! I work at the kennel they’re at so it’s basically a second home for them. Whenever we go out of town they board for a couple days (we want to keep them comfortable with it in case we ever need to board them in an emergency) and then one of my coworkers will bring them home until we get back :)
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,fe6qhjd,t1_fe6ppmk,1578900638.0,"Haha I can see that, she’s just licking her lips. She’s not too happy about the situation but she’d take a bullet for the little guy and would never ask him to move, so she’s asking my friend (I work at the kennel so they know all the staff well) to do it for her. Don’t worry, my friend swapped them right after this!"
ExNoContact,fdjfhrh,t1_fdh9r3x,1578468586.0,I’ve got a Matt who’s been way too on my mind today this is so lovely thank you universe! We got this gang
depression,fd8aaoo,t3_ek3uky,1578215838.0,"Here’s what helped me through a nasty, cruel breakup a year ago: It’s going to feel horrible for a long time, there’s no sugarcoating that, but in the big picture this is a GOOD thing. You’ve been given the opportunity to purge your life of people who don’t care for you the way you deserve. You’re going to have to go through the whole process of learning to live and be okay without these people and it’s going to suck but in the long run the life you deserve has no room for people who have the capability to do something like this. It’ll feel like two big, horrible, empty holes in your life for a while but in betraying you they’ve done you a favor - you now have room in your life, once you feel ready to let them in, for new people who can care for you and love you properly. Your wounds will heal and someday you’ll be so happy with someone and this will all be a distant memory."
DecidingToBeBetter,f9wapwy,t3_e76v9w,1575689698.0,I don’t know what your bf is like but I’d really recommend watching [this](https://youtu.be/OYoIVCHVwKI) video and looking into attachment theory. I’ve definitely got a very anxious attachment style and it sounds like you do too.
