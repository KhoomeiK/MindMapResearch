I‚Äôve had all 3, low iron right now that I can‚Äôt seem to increase. B12 supplements are fine to take, but iron ones suck, lol. What about b12 shots? I‚Äôve had a few of them and they‚Äôre great, can‚Äôt remember any side effects they just made me stay and wait to see if I‚Äôd have any reactions. Ask your doctor about the shots and get on a supplement, 24 mcg (micrograms) is more than enough, anything more is a waste of money. 
I also believe red meat is what you need to eat for b12.

‚ÄúAnemia or nervous system injury from lower than normal amounts of vitamin B12.
Vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to a reduction in healthy red blood cells (anemia). The nervous system also may be affected. Diet or certain medical conditions may be the cause.‚Äù From the internet.
