raisedbyborderlines,ez8kvwj,t3_d086fc,1567746929.0,"When I was 10 years old, my BPD mother thought my dad was cheating on her. There was a stint of time that his job was in LA and he had to fly back and forth to see us. She wanted me to call him and make up a story that I'd overheard her flirting with a neighbor on the phone to see how he would react. Maybe to make him jealous or get revenge? I don't know her reasoning.

At 10 years old, I could only see bad outcomes to this, so I told her it was wrong and I wouldn't do it. She raged at me, but I was past the point of caring (she had turned physically abusive years earlier and I basically just hated her and had no interest in being her doll/puppet/toy anymore.)

Shortly after that, she started playing the helpless victim and trying to get me to take care of her, essentially parent her. It honestly made me sick.

Anyway she died when I was a teen. It fucked me up but my trauma clinician/therapist and I agree it was a blessing in disguise. Those years living with my dad after she died were the best years of my childhood. 

Short answer: you don't owe her anything, no she doesn't have the right to ask that of you, be as direct as possible when you interact with her, don't play her games. Big hugs! You're a warrior."

I am going to remind myself I did a good job today by not lashing out at him. Try to reward myself with some loving, positive internal feedback..."
