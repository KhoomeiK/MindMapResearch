The fact that Trisha has all this backlash and yet she still keeps on trying to convince people that she has DID, instead having different personalities for different people like everyone else.

Okay so that photograph was taken when I was around 7, I'm not entirely sure. It was at a friend's birthday party that consisted of me (in blue), the rest of the kids including the birthday girl (who've been scribbled out because privacy reasons) and my girlfriend (in red). All of the girls including me know each other because we all lived in the same village and went to the same school, but the girl who's birthday it was had also invited a girl that none of us knew at all (she used to be friends with this girl in the village she lived in before she moved to ours and they never lost contact, if that makes sense). So at the party, we all met up at Birthday Girl's house and a Hannah Montana limousine (snazzy af, high class transport) arrived to take us to the place where the actual party and activities were happening (some sort of fun centre, it's irrelevant) and before we left, the moms lined us up in front of the limo so we could take a picture for memories. I ended up standing next to the girl nobody knew except for the Bday Girl. Little me didn't think anything of it and the moms took the pictures, and we got in the limo and had a great time at the party. Now for the time in-between the party and high school, I kept this photo on my wall. I was a proud collector of photos and memories and loved displaying them on my wall, and I still do. So yes, I knew this picture existed and I kept it because I knew the other girls in the photo and I wanted to keep a memory of the fun day. I thought nothing of it; it was nothing more than a picture of a party: pretty regular. 

Fast forward to high school. I was the only person from my school, as I moved to a new area with a closer school than the one other kids from my school were going to. I was pretty lonely, but I soon became friends with a really kind girl who I'll call Megan for the sake of privacy. Megan was really nice and we became fast friends, and I began to hang out with her not just in class but at lunch breaks too, rather that sitting on my own in the cafeteria. Then one day she asked me if I wanted to hang out with her other friends who she'd known since pre school. We'll call them Katy and Lauren (again, anonymity). At first, I was quite nervous and we didn't really speak with each other much, but soon they started acting like they really liked me genuinely. As time went on, I started realising that I felt something.. different around Katy. There was just something about her. She was really interesting, and I always loved talking to her, and she was brave and cool and never cared what anyone else thought about her and had strong opinions. She was also really pretty. Even when I was young I'd always thought that girls were really pretty, but I just thought that was something every girl thought. When I started to think more about things like this and learned about the LGBTQ+ community (still young), I was confused at the backlash that gay, lesbian or queer received because I didn't think there was anything wrong with that, despite what people said. I thought things like ""what's so bad about a girl kissing another girl, girls are pretty! I wouldn't mind kissing a girl THAT much, but I'm not gay!"" (spoiler alert, I am. very.) Back to high school. I started questioning my sexuality and finally accepted that what I was feeling for Katy was a crush. I told nobody, not even Megan about this crush. Even though I accepted myself for being a lesbian, I didn't really feel that it was acceptable to actually like a girl, especially as she was my best friend. So I kept quiet for months on end. As our friendship as a group got stronger (Me, Megan, Katy and Lauren) we became more comfortable with each other. We would hug eachother, be affectionate, stuff like that. This included Katy being affectionate with me. A short list of examples:

‚Ä¢She'd put her head in my lap quite often

‚Ä¢Compliment me a lot

‚Ä¢And on a school trip to London (We were watching Wicked on stage :) lOvE mE sOmE mUsIcAlSsS) halfway through the performance she put her head on my shoulder and stayed like that for the rest of the musical (I died inside that night I could barely breathe and my heart was racing)

And I slowly started to realize that   m a y b e    she felt the same way about me because everything she did was things I wanted to do but was to nervous (that make sense?).
So possibly a month after this school trip to London, Katy went on a vacation to Portugal with her family. I don't know what on earth compelled me to do it but on the day she was set to fly home, I sent her a text explaining how I felt about her. I explained how I felt something different around her but I wasn't sure whether it was platonic or romantic. I got a text from her that day at lunch on Snapchat (texts in another country cost her) reading that she'd got my message and that we needed to talk the following day. I wanted to jump off a cliff. Long story short, I was too chicken to talk to her, and got another friend called Grace and we had a conversation through her (for example: Me: what did she say? Grace: she said..... Me: tell her I said....., etc,.)
The conclusion was, she felt the same way, but wasn't ready for a relationship just yet. We proceeded to break through the awkwardness and began to act like a couple in secret. Bearing in mind, the only people who knew were me, Katy and Grace. Megan and Lauren were unaware, and quite naive too. Despite not labelling ourselves as a couple, we still acted like a couple for months nonetheless and then Halloween last year she asked me to be my girlfriend via a meme. I agreed, and we officially became a couple and decided to tell Megan and Lauren. They both had a very positive response and were really supportive of us.
Skip forward again to all of us having a sleepover in my house for the first time ( past sleepovers had been in Lauren's house because it was hUgE) and were hanging out in my room when Katy spots the photograph from the party on my wall. She asks me who's party this was, and if I was in the picture and proceeds to tell me that it was her the photo standing next to me! needless to say we were laughing hysterically. 
We're all still next friends, and me and Katy (not her real name btw) are still together to this day, and plan on getting married and adopting many doggos and maybe the odd child when we're older.

It's a long story, but you asked for it! Have a great day and much love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
