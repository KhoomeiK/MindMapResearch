No self promotion, except in user flair, and in our weekly Self Promotion post. Our weekly self-promotion post is on every Sunday. This is where you can introduce yourself to the users of BGCr. Any self-promotion will be removed. This includes drama channels and your personal blogs.

 Additionally, no advertising is allowed on BeautyGuruChatter. Do not mention that you are a BG or seek advice on how to better your content. Do not recommend or discuss a video you have uploaded. If you would like to connect with BGCr and have a public channel and want to create traffic- we ask that you message the moderator team to be verified by us. After verification we will add a flair to your username that confirms you are the BG. 

Last, no solicitation of any nature including promoting your own Discord servers or data mining requests. Do not ask for users to participate in your university research study, or for your beauty company analytics. No data mining either! 

Beauty influencers sometimes visit and participate in the sub, and they are very welcome here, but they must be aware that we do not require criticism to be constructive. We'd love to see people keep it lighthearted, but that said, if fans have an opinion to share, even if it is not ""nice"", they are welcome to do so, with these restrictions; no gendered slurs, no body shaming, no armchair diagnosis, no discussion of, or speculation about, personal or family matters (unless the BG is currently discussing them publicly), and no asking for nudes or speculating about their sex lives. Anything that is prohibited at the top of our rules list in rule one also extends to BGs as well.

No low effort pans. A low effort pan is one that you can barely see, a daily use personal hygiene product, or a forced drill pan into a lip balm. These are all just examples but can extend to more things. If you have a barely visible pan, we just ask that you use it a couple more times so it can clearly be shown. 

If you have any questions/comments/concerns we can be reached via ModMail."

PanPorn,fqup25j,t3_gl24f2,1589662392.0,"Thank you for your submission on r/PanPorn! Unfortunately, this post violates Rule 1: 

A quick google search of the definition of “personal hygiene products” includes: shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, soap, feminine care products, hand sanitizer, and toothpaste/oral care. This also extends to dry shampoo and face wash. If it is something that you use and repurchase on a regular basis for personal hygiene, please do not include this in your post. If there are multiple rule breaking items in your post, the moderation team reserves the right to discuss the post in question before approval. We want to be more consistent in what we allow and do not allow on this subreddit, so stricter rules will be enforced (but we encourage you to always give feedback and challenge our decision if needed) If anything also, these are just “low effort” empties and pans.

If there is any issues/comments/concerns please feel free to message us via modmail."

BeautyGuruChatter,fqs9a3g,t3_gko49d,1589601423.0,"Thank you for contributing to /r/BeautyGuruChatter! Unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

>All duplicate posts/similar topics/updates will be removed.

>To prevent clutter, when duplicate threads are made the one posted later will be removed. Updates, opinions, etc can also be shared in the original thread rather than making new ones each time a minor development occurs.

>If a major event occurs within the beauty community, the first post may be made a designated megathread to keep the feed decluttered. 

>For example: If a beauty guru’s brand announces a palette, do not post an update post. You should go to the active thread already posted and post your update/commentary there instead. Additionally, please search for duplicates before posting. Redundant posts add nothing new to previous conversations.
