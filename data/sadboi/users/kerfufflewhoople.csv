AmItheAsshole,fnmabpy,t3_g2gh5m,1587067850.0,"NTA. I'm Parisian and I live in Paris. To be frank, I've been to nice restaurants, but never one where the female company's menu comes without prices. I've been to places where the waiter comes over to have us taste the wine before we buy the bottle and only my boyfriend gets to taste it, though. We all found this pretty funny, laughed about it and joked about how sexist it is (even the waiter agreed). I (a woman) happen to be an expert in wine, my boyfriend has no clue about it. 

Yes, it's a very sexist thing. But making a scene is pretty pointless. Parisian waiters don't give a fig about scenes. They're used to it. They'll just shrug it off and you guys would look like idiots. Kudos for her for realising how stupid and sexist it is though."

You haven't learned yet how to tackle them and you were just doing the best you could with the tools that you had at the time. Trust me, therapists see a LOT worst on a daily basis. You'll be okay. You'll know when it's the right time to start your sessions. I wish you the best."
socialanxiety,feutxzi,t1_feps0sb,1579389870.0,Except exposure therapy only works if the patient is consenting and aware of what's happening.

I was there on the verge of tears reading the same sentence out loud all over again for over half an hour while the other kids laughed and mocked me, to her great amusement
> made me give a speech on the microphone in front of the entire school at every school party, then came after me and apologised to the audience for my quiet voice, stressing in front of the entire school + parents that she was doing this to ''force me out my shell''
> once made me publish a book from writings she found on my secret diary, then sign autographs for 1000+ kids
> regularly shamed me in front of the entire class for my shyness which would ''get (me) nowhere in life''
> called my parents every other month to complain about it and recommend shock exposure therapy

 This is violence. Classic violence. This is a man who cannot control his frustration nor show empathy.

And worse. You showed him the replies you got here and he tried to convince you we were al crazy. That's called gaslighting. One incident, four major red flags:

- selfishness (putting his sleep above your distress)
- violence (slamming a door on your legs)
- lack of empathy (saw you cry, didn't apologise, slammed a door on your legs, still didn't apologise or check on you)
- gaslighting (''you're too dramatic, it didn't happen like that and those people on the internet are all crazy. There's 900+ of them and they're all crazy)

My mum was a therapist and she dealt with lots of handicapped grow-ups, with varying levels of sexual awareness. She had this one adult patient, a young man in his 30s, with a severe form of autism but a very high sex drive. Obviously he had no sense of what's socially acceptable, so if he thought a woman looked pretty, he went ahead and wanted to touch her. His parents brought him in for therapy with my mum, and despite their best attempts to restrain him, he was a big, strong guy and his folks were in their 70s. He got up from his chair and began trying to touch my mum multiple times. She had to ask them to leave and reassign him a male therapist."
DeadBedrooms,exbxdsz,t3_cry0id,1566139637.0,"Oh, gosh, i'm so sorry for you OP.

The part that made me utter a very loud WTF was the bit where you said your pregnancy weirded him out. What. The. Fuck. Really, is he 8 years old? I could possibly understand not wanting to have sex with your pregnant wife because well, it's not very comfortable, some people think it's weird because the baby's technically right there, body changes, etc. But using a past pregnancy as an excuse to not feeling attracted to someone is some of the biggest bullshit I've ever read. 
 
OP's wife, if you're reading this, here's a couple of things I've got to say to you: you went 4 years without touching your beautiful, loving wife, using the fact that you once saw her pregnant as a lame-ass excuse to not feeling attracted to her anymore. Good luck thinking of shagging the pornstars you see on screen. They never get pregnant, their bodies never change and they never get frustrated over your refusal to address your mental issues. Isn't it wonderful? You know what's even better? They'll never ever know your name or have your back when you're down because they only exist on your phone screen."
AmItheAsshole,exbsy0y,t3_cs0bfh,1566137505.0,"YTA. I understand your point and your fears, but a wedding is not ''Bride's Day'', meaning all attention is on wife-to-be and damn anyone who says or does anything that shifts the focus away from the bride.

A wedding is a family event where love is celebrated. Your brother finally felt like coming out after many years and decided that this would be the moment to take the first step since attention is not gonna be on him anyway. 

I understand that you don't want your big day ruined by family gossip, but I think you're focusing a little too much on yourself. This is something he has thought through for a very long time and it certainly took balls to announce it to you that his plus one is his boyfriend.

No, I am not going to cheat, but for some reason my brain is reacting pretty much like an animal brain would."
DeadBedrooms,evc9i5k,t1_evc8npu,1564409893.0,"Very interesting points, i'm afraid I have to agree. No, he has never made me cum, not once in 6 years. Foreplay was never really a thing, but at least he did some exciting things, such as kissing me passionately outside or use moments when nobody was looking to grope me, etc. I felt like he really was into me and my body back then.

As for your second question, nope, he has fingered me a couple of times but maybe for like, 3 to 5 seconds? It got so bad at one point I had chronic vaginal inflammation from never being wet when he penetrated me. Wham bam thanks ma'am is totally his thing. I talked to him about this numerous times but I don't get much of a reaction. Once he went as far as to say that he finds 'fingering' and touching wet vaginas in general 'gross'."
DeadBedrooms,evc59s8,t1_evby7b9,1564406686.0,"It's true, unfortunately. He's always been adamant about not performing oral on women (I believe he thinks vaginas are dirty or something of the sort), but he doesn't try other things, such as fingering me. I have begged him to let me bring toys into the bedroom so he could play with me with those (I get off super fast with toys) but I feel like he took it as an attack on his masculinity or something and refused.

The result is pretty unsatisfying sex to be honest. He always gets off, I never do. He never asks or cares, it's like he legit avoids the subject because he knows the answer."
DeadBedrooms,evc51jo,t1_evc3463,1564406502.0,"It wasn't much better, it's just that we did it more often and he showed evident signs of being more into me back then. I haven't changed much physically during these 6 years, so I don't think the 10-ish pounds I might have gained would drastically make me less attractive.

There is a good chance there is some resentment, that is true, but he knows what I felt like before, he was around to witness my long struggles with therapy and medication before I began to re-emerge from that slumber, so I don't think he thinks that I faked it or that I just didn't care about his needs."
relationship_advice,evbtzn0,t1_ev9jqep,1564394391.0,"Thank you so much for this comment. It makes total sense, it's like you read my mind.

Yes, I am the hopeless romantic type. It's tacky and silly, but if you pick up a half-dead wild flower on your way home and give it to me, I'll melt and cry and thank you profusely, possibly even save it between the pages of a special book with a little note about who gave it to me and when. That's the hopeless romanticism syndrome I suffer from. 

My boyfriend is obviously not the same. I think he loathes sappy stuff of the sort. If I were to bring him a full bouquet of carefully picked flowers, he'd sneer and groan that's allergic and *please get those away from me.* 

At first I felt very hurt by this, then I just learned to swallow it, then I started to question it as I grew increasingly sadder about the whole ordeal. My therapist says I need to be more vocal about what I want instead of expecting him to guess, but in my humble opinion it's quite obvious that I need a certain frequent validation of his feelings for me, and for god's sake, it's not even that hard! (definitely not the type of girl who expects expensive presents or diamond rings)

I don't think he's narcissistic but he's known to be a selfish person who doesn't always stop to think of how others might feel. He just says whatever comes to mind and only realises how harsh that sounded when he sees me in tears. It's very frustrating because I literally have to tell him every single step of the way how I *need* him to act in a relationship, otherwise I feel like he won't make an effort to guess.

Back to the engagement thing. I told him yesterday that I felt a little bit hurt that he was so vocal about disliking my gift and immediately putting it aside. He acted like he had no idea his attitude could be hurtful and since then is making a show of wearing the thing, but I still feel quite bad about it."

We agreed that this was a yes but that we'd talk again about logistic in a few months. I totally understand, but I can't help but feel sad about how the whole thing went.

To be frank, I think he's a little scared of losing his freedom, especially when it comes to the image he reflects on his buddies or even family. I think he might feel weird about the whole 'guys, I'm getting married!' step up. I don't know if this has anything to do with me, though.

Ashamed of being engaged, ashamed of me, possibly, I don't know, maybe it's not that at all but right now my self-esteem is at its lowest."
relationship_advice,ev9hltm,t1_ev9gki3,1564321946.0,"Yes, multiple times. He brought it up first months ago when we were in the process of buying a house. ''After that, we'll need to marry and then perhaps have children'', he said in passing. I was very honored that he would mention marriage but to be frank, I was a little bummed that he would mention it like that, like another chore. I told him I'd sure love to marry him, but that I'd also like one of us to pop the actual question first with a bit more passion than that. He said sure but didn't jump on it. After a few months, and as I saw that he wouldn't take the first step, I decided to stop being frustrated over something I had no control over and to sincerely ask if he would marry me. The rest is in the post above but tl;dr, he said yes, but requested that I do 'more than that' (just ask), that's why I went for a more formal proposal with a piece of jewelry."
relationship_advice,ev9h8ws,t1_ev9geoj,1564321629.0,"Haha, thanks for making me feel better about my taste in jewelry dude xD I thought it looked classy and timeless, reason why I went for it instead of a cheaper option."
relationship_advice,ev9h5x4,t1_ev9gvzb,1564321556.0,"Thanks for the insight. My own father doesn't wear his wedding ring either because it's not very comfortable, but well... I'm pretty sure he was very grateful for it and didn't immediately put it aside literally 20 min after my mum put it on him. I don't expect someone to wear something they don't like but well, him declaring that it was a 'gay' bracelet and that he wouldn't wear it minutes after I popped the question was sort of like a bucket of ice water, do you know what I mean?"
relationship_advice,ev9gxwu,t1_ev9glhu,1564321366.0,"Thank you. I think so too, both times I didn't want to make a fuss so I smiled through it, but I felt very hurt. First time because he literally made me feel like he ''was worth more than this'', second because he took it as just a random present that he could afford to openly dislike and put aside immediately. I totally don't want to fuss over a piece of metal and I don't give a fig what people will or not think if he wears it or doesn't wear it, I just wish my intention had gotten a bit more appreciation."
relationship_advice,ev9gpu7,t1_ev9g6y5,1564321167.0,"It could be that, it's a fair point. Maybe I didn't explain it well enough on my initial post, but I had actually proposed a few weeks before and it didn't go so great. He said yes, but also that expected me to do 'something more'. As in, bring him a present or a piece of jewelry or do something special. That's why I decided to do just that and redo the proposal with an actual token. But like you pointed out, maybe he doesn't feel okay with letting other people know I proposed, instead of him. He won't admit this, though, we talked and talked and his only reason is apparently that he 'doesn't like it much'. Maybe he's afraid to hurt me if he says it plain and simple that he feels bad that I did it and not him, though, but I thought we were more solid than that."
relationship_advice,ev9fkm6,t1_ev9f5ci,1564320100.0,"Thank you for the sound advice. As I said before in a different comment, even if he proposed to me with the ugliest ring in existence, I'd still wear it proudly everyday and cherish it for its meaning. He once gave me a bracelet I wasn't crazy about and I still wore it every single day until it broke apart, and even then, I picked up the beads and put them on my necklace. 

To be fair, what hurt is not only that I put thought and money into this, what hurts is that I know part of the reason he won't wear it is because his buddies will ask what it is and he doesn't want to tell them that we're engaged. I asked if I could tell my family and he said not yet as well. I feel as if he was kind of ashamed of being engaged to me and it sort of throws me into this loop of bad thoughts where I feel like I'm never good enough and that I'm always a side dish that shouldn't take up too much space. I thought the engagement would maybe reverse that and make me feel a little bit more valued, but his attitude made me feel even worse."
relationship_advice,ev9e78p,t1_ev9drj8,1564318717.0,"I know, I'm usually not one to fuss over this kind of thing. I'm not the controlling type, I don't give a fig for things like presents and material possessions but I confess that this kind of hurt me. I don't make a lot of money at my job and I used a significant part of my savings to buy him a good quality, custom token with the date we first met engraved on it. I know he has his own taste and it's hard to please him in general, so I went for something as classic and subdued as I could find. I wasn't expecting him to be crazy about it, but I was expecting him to not mention it if he disliked it and that he'd wear it. He once got me a bracelet that wasn't 100% my style either, but I wore it for years until it literally broke apart. And when it did, I used to beads to make a necklace that I still wear."
relationship_advice,ev9dx19,t1_ev9dm5z,1564318422.0,"He had previously told me he didn't like rings, and since he wears bracelets, I decided to get him one. If we ever do get married, I would obviously prefer rings, but I'm pretty sure he'll never want to wear his. Not that it matters much, but I'm not really hype about spending a ton of money on matching rings only I will wear."
relationship_advice,ev9ds64,t1_ev9dnz1,1564318279.0,"I considered that but he told me he didn't like rings. As for me, if he bought me whatever ring, I would treasure it and wear it no matter what, even if it was the ugliest ring in existence. I think what matters is intention, not the object."
NonBinary,ev85yem,t1_ev84xsp,1564270175.0,"It makes total sense. I know not everyone is kind and understanding and if I were LGBT myself, I would like to keep control of who I come out to and when.

I was corrected on pronouns a few times in the past and I felt a little bad, because I know I should have asked but didn't, and I wondered if I had somehow upset the person. It reassures me to know that you wouldn't take it bad if someone accidentally misgendered you."
NonBinary,ev85jnm,t1_ev85262,1564269855.0,"Thank you, very interesting reply. I so sometimes see people with such ''vibes'', but obviously I don't want to make assumptions based on personal style or androgyny - pretty much like I don't like assuming a man is guy just because they are ''effeminate''.

I will definitely take note of your strategy. Next time I hesitate, I will begin by mentioning my own pronouns. Sounds to me like a very gentle and polite way of letting others know their identity and choices will be respected!"
NonBinary,ev858tb,t1_ev84en8,1564269621.0,"Thanks! That's interesting. I have been told by a non-binary acquaintance that straight up asking about gender is a little bit too intimate a question. Usually, when I see someone whose gender I can't identify, I refrain from asking because I'm afraid of offending them. Do you personally feel okay with being asked?"
NonBinary,ev84dc2,t1_ev83qba,1564268999.0,"Thanks for your reply! Forgive me for the potentially silly question, but in your experience, how does one sense a situation where they might want to inquire a person's pronouns? Do you usually judge new people based on appearance? Or do you maybe wait until they say something that might make you think they are not binary?"

To be frank, you need to get professional help first. It does make a huge difference and I don't know where I would be today if I hadn't sought it in the right moment. Besides that, here are a few tips and tricks my therapist gave me over the years: 

\> Look up. I mean, literally. Sit up with your back straight, bend your neck and look up at the ceiling for about 10 minutes. It sounds crazy, but by doing this thing with your body, you get some much-needed clarity.

\> Grab a blank page and plan your recovery in the form of a scheme or drawing. List pros and cons, reasons to be sad and reasons to be happy, and then for each line of the former, write down a possible solution. It can be as simple as ""loneliness"" > ""get a dog""

\> Meditation. Sounds lame, I know, but medidation is an incredibly powerful thing and there's plenty of guided talkdowns on Youtube. Don't question it, the instructions will sounds totally nuts at first, but just do it.

\> Read The Power of Now, by Eckhart Tolle. There is a reason why this guy is one of the world's most respected mental health gurus.

\> Projection. As difficult as it might be, picture yourself in a scenario where you would be calm and happy. It doesn't matter if it's crazily far-fatched.

\> Shower, wash your hair, style it, shave, do your nails, etc. You probably definitely don't feel like doing that now but trust me, you will thank me later.

\> If a kind and understanding friend is available, call them up, go somewhere and tell them everything that's on your mind.

\> If you have a hobby, dive into it, head-first. It can be a really weird thing. Mine is reading creepy articles on wikipedia (don't judge!)

\> But first and foremost, remember that your anxious/depressed mind lives in a body, and if that body isn't properly hydrated, fed and rested, chances are that's making you feel 300% worse. Go get yourself a big glass of water NOW, cook a nutritious meal and take a nap. You can plan your recovery later."

paris,eufw2qr,t1_eufv7bk,1563792795.0,"Definitely try to pass for a local. And do never, ever stop on the street to talk to anyone. If someone walks up to you to say something, chances are it's a scammer or a creep."
paris,eufunsa,t3_cgamn0,1563791374.0,"If that's all that ever happened to your wife when she was alone walking the streets of Paris, considere yourselves very lucky. Here's a short list of all the crap I experienced in my almost 10 years living here: 

\> A creep following me and trying to interact everyday when I lived in a college campus in Nanterre. I complained about it to campus security, the two guards looked at each other, then at me, then burst out laughing.

\> Some crazy dude on the metro once decided to grab my nose. I have no idea why. I tried to struggle out of it and break loose, but the guy kept laughing and pinching my nose. It went on for 2 min. Nobody batted an eye.

\> I was on an escalator and felt an odd breeze on my legs. The guy behind me had lifted my skirt to take a picture.

\> I was eating alone at a mostly empty McDonalds in Ménilmontant. A gay came over and asked if he could sit right beside him. I told him no. He started to loudly insult me, I grabbed my stuff and left. 

\> I was in the metro (again). I felt someone standing very close behind me. I looked back, it was a dude with his dick out.

\> I was eating an ice cream while walking in République. A dude walked past me and spat in it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I strongly advice against living here if crazy people are a deal-breaker for you."
AmItheAsshole,etwikvz,t3_cdr4r0,1563272294.0,"NAH. A nose piercing isn't a big deal and you should just let her do what she want with her looks, but getting a fake ID is something that she can get into a lot of trouble for. Make sure she doesn't do it again and tell her about what alcohol, drugs and cigarettes can do to people."

Have you ever wondered that perhaps the story isn't as simple as you're making it? There might be past trauma associated and wounds they're not willing to reopen. You're a total asshole for forcing them to interact when both had already told you that they didn't want to."
