nextfuckinglevel,fqw4t0m,t3_gl7rak,1589692862.0,I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia since 2017 but have had symptoms stemming ground around 2007. I was keeping many of the symptoms outside of insomnia hidden while in the military and only saw treatment for the other symptoms once I was getting out. It wasn't until then that I found out that I watched a Korean woman from my first tour in Korea (2006) committed suicide this way when I was 19. I blocked it out evidently but it's crazy to think that all those people in the video could have been just like me. It still blows my mind that people find this to be a reasonable way to go out.
