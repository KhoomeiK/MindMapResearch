I've added a link to a 2008 literature review that discusses the roles of probiotics in the vaginal microbiome. There is alot of evidence that preventing and treating infections is largely influenced by the existing microbiome, which includes lactobacillus, a very common bacteria in the GI. The reason we dont want contamination in the vagina from the GI is because of E coli, which can be very pathogenic. So if we beef up the amount of lactobacillus, they're more likely to co-colonize the GI and the vaginal tract. Think of it like herd immunity. The more healthy bacteria you have, the less likely the bad ones can overtake them. This also goes for yeast, which lives in the vagina normally.

AskReddit,f45gerk,t3_djioe0,1571376047.0,"The idea that I am in charge of what I do every day. And what I do is a gift to my future self. If you're struggling, I recommend the following. 

Small things first. The first thing you should always make sure of is have you met your basic needs. Have you eaten something nourishing today? How have you been sleeping? Have you showered? After that, you've already accomplished more than if you hadn't done anything and cried in bed (like we all feel like doing tbh). All it takes is you starting. That initial push to start doing something is the absolute hardest part, but also the most important. So start small. And gain momentum. 

So you're caring for yourself now, what you should focus on next is doing stuff to care for your environment. Do you have clean laundry. Are you out of food. All this moving and focusing on how to improve your situation can add to that momentum of self care we started earlier. 

Now that you've improved your surroundings, do something that makes you happy. Doesnt matter what it is. Anything that sparks joy in your heart. 

These are some basic steps to battle the crippling part. Once you are moving forward and caring for your needs, you need to start dealing with your inner demons. This took me over 20 years to do consistently and I still have to do it every day. Most recently I've been trying to be kinder to myself in my head. I try to think of my negative thoughts as clouds passing in the sky. I can just watch them pass and imagine them just blowing away. 

You cant beat depression all at once. Just like eating an elephant; you must do it one bite at a time. 

tl;dr: 1. Self care, 2. Improve your environment, 3. Do something that makes you happy, 4. Recognize and acknowledge your demons but let go of them. But do that part only when you've done the other ones."
