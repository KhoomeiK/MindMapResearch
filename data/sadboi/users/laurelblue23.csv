Advice,fqhm51d,t3_gizq8a,1589379790.0,"I know that religion doesn't help everybody, and I know for the most part, it didn't help me. But one of the things that really stuck with me from the Bible was ""Lord, forgive them, for they know not what they do."" Now you may be like, ""Forgive them? Why? They absolutely know what they do."" And you're right. People have free will. But they don't necessarily always have the enlightenment to truly understand how others are affected by their actions. When they are in the heat of the moment, they only think about themselves. Everybody has been guilty of this at some point or another.

Nobody's perfect. Some people are vile and awful and there is no changing them. But there are others just like you and I and the people in your life who have consciences. And I'm pretty sure none of those people would deliberately harm a person for no reason, wouldn't deliberately inconvenience them. One of the first things people should know is that the world is not out to get them. The world does not care enough to specifically persecute you. And neither do the people you love. Because if they love you, they wouldn't *mean* to do these things, they wouldn't *mean* to hurt you. Like I said, while there are awful people in this world, there are more people who choose to do good than people who choose to do bad."

1 tablespoon of butter
1 tablespoon of flour
1 cup of heavy cream or 2 cups of milk
2 cups of mild cheddar cheese
sage
salt
pepper

8 ounces of dry spaghetti

3 hot dogs
8 large shrimp
1 tablespoon of butter
garlic powder
onion powder
lemon juice

Step 1:

Melt the 1 tablespoon of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour after to make a paste. Then, gradually whisk in the 1 cup of heavy cream or 2 cups of milk. Season with sage, salt, and pepper. Stir the mixture until it comes to a slight boil, then add the 2 cups of cheese. Stir to thicken.

Step 2:
Salt water in a pot and bring to a rolling boil. While it boils, cut up the 3 hot dogs. Once it reaches the rolling boil, put the spaghetti noodles in the water and let cook for 7 to 8 minutes on medium heat. After the noodles are done cooking, take them out of the water and let them drain over the sink. KEEP THE HOT WATER and put the cut-up hot dogs inside it.

Step 3: While the noodles cool and the hot dogs boil, it is time to prepare the shrimp. Melt the butter in a pan over medium heat and place the shrimp inside. Season them lightly with onion powder, garlic powder, and lemon juice. You only need to season them on one side. Cook them until they're pink and flip them over until they're pink on the other side too.

Step 4: Put the drained spaghetti in a bowl and pour the cheese sauce over it. Take the cut-up hot dogs out of the pasta water, drain them, and put them in the pasta along with the cooked shrimp. Toss and enjoy!"
AskReddit,fqfbbl3,t1_fqf7z1g,1589321879.0,"Homemade Hamburger Helper isn't my own recipe, it's from [this lady's site.](https://divascancook.com/homemade-hamburger-helper-recipe-cheeseburger-macaroni/) The macaroni salad is my own recipe. *It does not have mayonnaise in it, so if you are a fan of mayo, I suggest you either expect a more creamer, more savory consistency or sit this one out.*

Sauce:
1 tablespoon of unsalted butter
1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour
1/2 cup of water
1 teaspoon of chicken bouillon
2 teaspoons of heavy cream
salt and ground white pepper
just a teensy bit of cayenne pepper (like as much as you can fit under your pinky fingernail, but don't actually do that because it's gross so just sort of eyeball it)
1 teaspoon of honey mustard
1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning
pepper, paprika, onion powder (each according to taste)

Salad:
1 cup of dried macaroni
1/2 cup of green onions (or use 1/3 cup for white/yellow onions)
1/2 cup of finely chopped honey ham or lunch meat

Step 1:

Stir the teaspoon of chicken bouillon into the 1/2 cup of water. Whisk it so that it doesn't get all clumpy. Melt butter in a saucepan on medium-low heat and then whisk in the flour so it becomes a nice paste. Don't cook it too long because it'll start burning. Once it smells nice, gradually whisk in the chicken bouillon water and make sure it blends in with the flour. Keep it on medium-low heat, and stir until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Once it reaches that consistency, take it off the heat and stir in the 2 teaspoons of heavy cream along with the salt, white pepper, and cayenne pepper. Move it off the burner and let it cool a little bit. You're going to need that same burner to cook the pasta.

Step 2:
Salt water in a pot and get it to a rolling boil (I personally put it on medium-high for ten minutes.) Next, gently stir the cup of dried macaroni into the water and turn the heat to medium. I personally cook the noodles for seven or eight minutes on medium heat because it comes out al dente.

Step 3:
While the water/noodles boil, start chopping 1/2 cup green onions or 1/3 cup yellow or white onions as well as 1/2 cup of honey ham or lunch meat. Make sure the onions are finely sliced because green onions are stringy and yellow/white onions have a stronger taste. Set the onions and ham aside.

Step 4:

Once the noodles are done cooking, drain them over the sink and let them cool. Take the sauce you made from Step 1 and stir in the 1 teaspoon of honey mustard, 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, pepper, paprika, and onion powder. Make sure everything is evenly incorporated. Put the noodles in a bowl and pour the sauce over it as well as the onions and ham. Stir it so the noodles, onions, and ham are evenly coated. Wait for it to cool in the fridge or eat it while it is still warm. Enjoy! (Sketti 'n' cheese recipe coming after this one because character limit)"
