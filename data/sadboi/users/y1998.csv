Anxiety,fqi2pec,t1_fqhusmm,1589388819.0,is it really possible to quit social media? i always think of what other people might think of me to not have any account in social media while we're in 2020
vcu,fqe0zsa,t1_fqdox7t,1589299975.0,i totally agree with u about having a very disinterested student body and i can see that vcu is trying to build a community regardless of the results

introvert,fqaubgb,t1_fqar2rm,1589225411.0,if you only reread the title you'd know that i'm not saying poeple are happy with having other people dying! i'm just trying to say that it's not proper to share such thoughts during these strange circumstances

vcu,fpsknci,t1_fprznwo,1588875074.0,what i got from the head's last email is that the classes are gonna be in person with some instructions like less number of people in each class and practicing social distancing
introvert,fpj4zvo,t3_gdp5lm,1588656772.0,"my friend always makes fun of my introversion which's weird bc i don't think it's funny at all (it's actually my struggle since i was kid bc even my family doesn't support me and always asks me to make friends and socialize). i think extroverts have a real hard time understanding us. although we totally get and respect their need of social, loud life for some reason they still seem to be in denial about accepting us as who we are and always want to change/fix us as if they're healthy and we're ill"
vcu,fpizjqg,t3_gdqaxv,1588652555.0,"sorry to hear that, hope u get a second attempt if not try talking with ur advisor it's not fair to fail a class bc of slow wifi"
introvert,fpibidu,t3_gdfdq6,1588637516.0,"this... people think that talking is a sign of affinity while it's actually quite the opposite, being silent with someone without feeling awkward is what makes the relationship real. i mean i don't mind people talking if they ""really"" have something to talk about, but talking for the seek of breaking the silence is pretty irritating."
socialanxiety,fp8wi5p,t1_fp7qofl,1588405436.0,the fact that this has nothing to do with quarantine. what's the thing with u and quarantine people ðŸ˜‘

depression,fntj5di,t3_g3swn4,1587242707.0,i wish that too but i'm starting to believe that some people are just meant to be that way and yes it sucks and yes it's so unfair but that's just how it is

socialanxiety,fmr79dg,t1_fmpxgyd,1586315537.0,i don't know if that really help but i always think to myself that nobody know me here therefore nobody is gonna judge me but even if they did they're just people i don't really know and that's what i like about reddit
Anxiety,fmr632p,t3_fwp2qx,1586314739.0,yup sometimes it feels weird to feel better because we're used to getting worried. we always have something to worry about no matter what
Anxiety,fmr5csn,t3_fwm9rl,1586314251.0,"Thank you for bringing that up. although it's not healthy to keep doing that it still feels good to know that i'm not the only who's like that. what's funny is mintues before i read your post i was trying to sleep and i was thinking of some embarrassing memories of mine and the more i try to push them away and try to not think about them, the more they stick in my head and embarrass me as if they happened moments ago"

Oscars,fi7djw9,t3_f6sxzw,1582219304.0,I remember 2018 itself wasn't a pretty good year for the movie industry so looking at the nominations it makes sense why they were nominated

Oscars,fgqmfuj,t1_fgqh89l,1581027004.0,"Yes, the movie was about the story of his life although he added some made-up lines to make a better plot. I really loved the movie and how he portrayed himself but at the end of the day it's just a matter of taste."

Oscars,fgo4udp,t1_fgo3cdu,1580959814.0,I don't think it's going to win best picture anyway. but it'd definitely win best foreign-language although I'm hoping for Pain and Glory to win this category
Oscars,fgo33yd,t1_fgo2wiy,1580958655.0,are you really saying Parasite was better than Joker?

depression,fgh5hyh,t3_ey6pg8,1580777166.0,"This called ""compassion"". We live in a very rough time and this is actually needed because believe it or not knowing someone somewhere on this universe has read what you got to say and wanted to show you that You matter can somehow help some people (even if lil bit)."

depression,fcexz0q,t1_fcdw9gf,1577624766.0,I'm really sorry to hear that. It's quite unfair how bullying can live with the bullied for a very long time while probably the bullies have forgot about it the second they have done it. You deserve all the best.
vcu,f8abec6,t3_dznnov,1574392669.0,I'm thinking of taking elective english class and saw your suggestion. What do u usually do in class? and is there a lot of work? because my schedule is already heavyðŸ˜©
