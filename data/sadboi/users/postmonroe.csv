AskHR,fr20i1m,t1_fr1uk3a,1589829062.0,"360 means a full circle recruiting role. You find the client, you sell your services to them, they give you a position they’re hiring for, you find someone to fill the role.

Especially a 360 recruiting role because it  requires cold calling. If you’re going to be a recruiter, you’d probably wanna work for a company non-recruitment related. Unfortunately, a lot or recruitment roles are for 360 positions at recruiting agencies. It involves a lot of cold calling, maintaining client relationship, etc. It is essentially a sales position.

dating_advice,fqypq74,t1_fqykrwi,1589752515.0,"Right. It’s simple. I feel like on dating apps it’s so selective that you don’t need to preface “no short guys, no single parents, etc.” because you can view a profile and get a pretty good idea about who they are and swipe whichever direction you want.

dating,fqpmn7i,t3_gk6d6a,1589549869.0,"Confidence is key! It’s cheesy but true. Work on yourself. Start working out as much as you can. Try to live a healthy lifestyle. Drink less beer, eat more salad, etc. Find a hobby you like if you don’t already have one. This will give you something interesting to say about yourself other than “oh I just like video games.” If you’re truly interested in using dating apps, my advice is find a girl who you trust that is around your age (sister, cousin, friend, etc.) and have them help you make your profile. Girls are very picky on dating apps so it’s important to showcase your personality as well as have good pictures. Also, I don’t recommend Tinder. Try Hinge or Bumble. 

Once you’re ready to start swiping and get a few matches, DONT open with “Hey, what’s up?” It’s got to be the worst opening line there is. You’ll have much better luck mentioning something about their profile. Never let the conversation slack— make sure you carry it on. Don’t ever reply with less than 3 words. Always make sure you have an open ended response so they will reply back. This isn’t full proof but it will help. Eventually, you’ll be able to at least get a video date since a date in person isn’t all that safe right now. 

Source: my self and my many dating app escapades. 

Also remember, it’s totally not weird that you’ve never been on a date. It’s very normal, especially in college. Just play it cool and remember it’s okay to be nervous! Just be yourself."

AskMen,fqpk8o9,t3_gk42rr,1589548362.0,"Hey man, it sounds like you are depressed. After my ex girlfriend and I broke up last year, I was in a horrible place. I had always struggled with mental health but there was something different after she left. She broke my heart and I felt numb. I tried hooking up with other girls, staying distracted, making a lot of plans but at the end of the day it made me tired. It made me feel like I was faking who I was because I didn’t feel happy or excited, I felt sad and empty all the time. I genuinely wasn’t interested in forming a connection with anyone else because I didn’t have the energy. I stopped doing a lot of the things I enjoyed. I just faked it around everyone. 

The thing that helped me more than anything was opening up to my friends about it. One of my good friends told me “you don’t have to carry it all alone, let me help you carry it” and it was a perspective I never thought of before. By opening up to my friends and eventually my parents on what was going on with me helped more than you know. Eventually I started talking to a therapist regularly to help with things. 

Therapy doesn’t work for everyone but it is helpful for me to get some of the weight off. Being able to work through it with other people has helped me tremendously. But you have to want to get better in order to see change."
