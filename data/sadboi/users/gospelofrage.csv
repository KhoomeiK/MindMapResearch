Also you can spare me with the snide assumption that I don‚Äôt understand that gays aren‚Äôt all bent wrist tutu-wearing fruits. I am gay. Im aware that we look like everyone else kiddo.

I clearly meant that it isn‚Äôt happening at the rate you think it is and _isn‚Äôt something you need to be worried about._  Most genital mutilation is circumcision or FGM at birth."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqafu7o,t1_fqad77k,1589218353.0,"Also I just remembered; there‚Äôs a really interesting story about a [boy whose penis was accidentally mutilated at birth, so the doctor experimented on him and asked the parents to raise him female.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). They performed the surgeries on him as early as possible. He hated being a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù and eventually transitioned back to male, years before finding out he had been mutilated at birth, and the reports on him said that he always preferred typically masculine things as a kid and teenager. 

I find that it‚Äôs further proof of gender having a biological side; a cis male baby was forced to be raised as a girl but his brain always wanted to be a boy."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqaf4kv,t1_fqaesyh,1589218011.0,"... I don‚Äôt see a problem. That‚Äôs just info? Dude, you know it‚Äôs illegal for them to perform these surgeries on anyone under 18 right? And at 16 if you have a parental permission, but even that is rare. 

Are you trying to say that doctors are just willingly giving surgeries to 6 year olds because they like dresses? You‚Äôre insane. 

And no, I never said it isn‚Äôt real. I said it definitely isn‚Äôt a problem like you think it is."

PoliticalCompassMemes,fqae4tg,t1_fqad77k,1589217526.0,"Yeah, well, psychology is hard because you can‚Äôt do a brain scan on everyone who walks in, so I can agree that it‚Äôs subjective. Every psychologist will analyze you slightly differently because they can‚Äôt just see the chemicals in your brain. 

And yeah actually you‚Äôre right, there are some biological gender roles or at least that are clearly biologically influenced, like mothers being good with children or whatever."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqadvvj,t1_fqadgk6,1589217407.0,It isn‚Äôt. Show me an unbiased source that explains how genital mutilation is currently a big problem outside of circumcision.
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqadpvv,t1_fqacky3,1589217324.0,">the woman chose to do the action that caused the fetus to be inside her body

Doesn‚Äôt mean she chose to get pregnant. Do you know how many pregnancies are unplanned? A lot. And no, you can‚Äôt tell people not to have sex if they don‚Äôt want to deal with kids. That isn‚Äôt how our bodies work, were meant to have sex multiple times with our partner, not just when kids are wanted. It‚Äôs a form of release. There‚Äôs a reason you masturbate regularly. Same with sex. 

>killing them when you decide you don‚Äôt want them in your home after all. 

.. Yes. You can do that with an intruder too, in Texas. You can randomly decide you don‚Äôt want someone there and shoot them if they still won‚Äôt leave. Even if that wasn‚Äôt legal, I literally see no problem with it. Still her body, she‚Äôs always allowed to decide who is in it. 

>This exact same argument could be used for murder in general.

But you didn‚Äôt answer the question. Answer the question. Why does it matter? 

>their benefit outweighs the deaths caused by them.

Exactly. The benefit of abortion does outweigh the deaths caused by them. Without abortion you‚Äôd have more mothers _actually_ murdering their young children who DO feel pain and enjoy life. You‚Äôd also have an overloaded foster care and adoption system, which we already have as well. You‚Äôd have women killing themselves instead of just the fetus. And again, killing the fetus causes no pain and no loss because even if it is _alive_, it is not yet _living_ (as in actually experiencing life) so in my opinion nothing has been lost. Just potential. And potential doesn‚Äôt matter more than any of the reasons for abortion. 


A living human with consciousness, emotions, pain receptors, and a life should get to decide what exists inside of it, no matter how much you like the thing."
