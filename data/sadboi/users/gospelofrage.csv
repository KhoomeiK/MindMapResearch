You are part of the reason why posts like these get made in the first place, and your ignorance to how much you hurt the actual gay community and the future of gay rights is astoundingly hilarious.

I get the feeling you want lgbt to be a political identity because it gives you identity. Understandable. But my suggestion is to get off reddit and go find yourself.

People DEFINITELY bat an eye at public straight sex, are you a child??? It’s illegal. Everyone would call you out. Maybe except for teenagers. 

And that isn’t what people mean when they say “making of their identity”. It’s usually just about the questioning teenagers who have every single sexual preference in all of their social media bios, who talk too much about sex, again, the same things people get annoyed with straights for with the added unique distaste for having to publicly watch people go through sexual revelations or changes. Those things don’t need to be public. 

They’re not demanding you hide who you are. They’re asking that identity politics fucking goes away, and I agree. I, and they, want a world where it isn’t relevant that I’m gay unless I’m specifically asked about something relating to it or I’m looking for a partner. 

Also you can spare me with the snide assumption that I don’t understand that gays aren’t all bent wrist tutu-wearing fruits. I am gay. Im aware that we look like everyone else kiddo. 

It’s not homophobia to want a world where someone having an unusual sexual preference isn’t an issue nor is it ever relevant to talk about in non sexual settings. That’s what we’re all saying."

Same with slavery, oppression of women, and other oppressed classes. 

Second, there are a lot of issues regarding how the Bible was translated.

Doesn’t mean she chose to get pregnant. Do you know how many pregnancies are unplanned? A lot. And no, you can’t tell people not to have sex if they don’t want to deal with kids. That isn’t how our bodies work, were meant to have sex multiple times with our partner, not just when kids are wanted. It’s a form of release. There’s a reason you masturbate regularly. Same with sex. 

>killing them when you decide you don’t want them in your home after all. 

.. Yes. You can do that with an intruder too, in Texas. You can randomly decide you don’t want someone there and shoot them if they still won’t leave. Even if that wasn’t legal, I literally see no problem with it. Still her body, she’s always allowed to decide who is in it. 

>This exact same argument could be used for murder in general.

But you didn’t answer the question. Answer the question. Why does it matter? 

>their benefit outweighs the deaths caused by them.

Exactly. The benefit of abortion does outweigh the deaths caused by them. Without abortion you’d have more mothers _actually_ murdering their young children who DO feel pain and enjoy life. You’d also have an overloaded foster care and adoption system, which we already have as well. You’d have women killing themselves instead of just the fetus. And again, killing the fetus causes no pain and no loss because even if it is _alive_, it is not yet _living_ (as in actually experiencing life) so in my opinion nothing has been lost. Just potential. And potential doesn’t matter more than any of the reasons for abortion. 


A living human with consciousness, emotions, pain receptors, and a life should get to decide what exists inside of it, no matter how much you like the thing."
