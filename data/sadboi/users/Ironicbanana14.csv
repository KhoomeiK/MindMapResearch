I do feel like it is their issue for being triggered by it since i can't hold responsibility for someone being triggered simply by existing in the same space. It was not my intention to trigger them by wearing short sleeves/shorts, so i can't be responsible.

BPD,fqu54g7,t1_fqu2z9m,1589652204.0,"Most regular people find validation useful to build their identity, but mostly as a baby. As a baby, forms of validation come like feeding you when you cry, playing with you, and showing you the way without judgement. But when you don't get this as a child, it leaves you empty and searching for it forever in others. Most normal people are able to validate themselves, like you have a good way to do that with how you describe what you do. You are able to validate yourself efficiently. Usually DBT therapy is what teaches people with BPD to search within themselves rather than others. It stems from never having a stable parental figure.

Even as BPD, acting is a core of our recovery. We have to act ""normal"" essentially to heal, opposite action is the skill that can be related to. Say i am upset, so i will pretend i am not, meanwhile still allowing myself to feel upset. That way it doesn't bottle up and manifest in other unhealthy ways, if that makes sense at all.

I'm sure it would help some BPD people if you shared how you validate yourself, because there are many different things that work. But for some, they wouldn't grasp it. It really depends on the individual. In DBT there are so many coping skills because not just one will fix us all. You have to relate to it and find actual meaning for it to stick, personally i just try to stick to the facts, like i know i am worthy so i don't need someone to tell me so. Then i will list all the things that make me worthy.

But most people with BPD will need therapy for life, since it can only be put into ""remission"" rather than ""cured."" It is a personality disorder, unlike a chemical inbalance or mood disorder, many medications will not help with the intricacies, and you have to literally re-parent yourself."

BPD,fqts8z9,t1_fqtqsno,1589645102.0,"Yes that is somewhat true. I actively know what i want to do, but my emotions will cloud judgement and really make it hard to do the ""right"" thing, whatever it may be. It takes a lot of hard work. Usually what helps when im upset is validation. I wont go off nearly as much if someone says, ""I understand why you feel that way, it must be really hard.""

This is called validation. Even if you dont understand really, or you dont think its that hard, you can still give validation. Just make it sound sincere There are some things that you shouldn't validate however. Its kinda complicated so I'll give an example i got from therapy:

""Imagine a child falls off the bike. He is upset. You can validate why he is upset, of course he may have a scrape and it sucks to fall. That's understandable. But say the child no longer wants to ride his bike *ever again*. That is also understandable, but not something you want to validate, because that is an extreme reaction to a minor incident.""

 This is something a lot of BPD people don't receive, and usually validation is what caused our issues in the first place. BPD is thought to originate from childhood traumas, not being able to accurately express yourself or being ridiculed for very minor things. Also it might not be one event but rather many many small ones over time that lead to the development. BPD is close to PTSD, minus the one huge factor that PTSD can be traced to one or two major events. BPD develops over time.

The things you can do to help are things that seem quite simple but are very impactful, like shooting a text message saying you care , or just being able to tell your mom that you understand (even if you don't really.)

There is a tipping point where you feel like you can help deeply, but really there is nothing you can do besides offer support. The work has to come from within the BPD person to really see a change."

BPD,fqtpieq,t3_gks1up,1589643562.0,"Every emotion is very extreme, or either nothing at all. Each person with BPD has a different experience but this is mine.

I went my entire childhood with no emotions. No attachment to anything, probably close to how you feel. Once i graduated high school, it all flooded in, every emotion i denied myself.

Once i hit that point, i couldn't function. The real world was too painful, too hateful, anxiety inducing. I would say i am ""quiet bpd"" which means instead of taking my emotions out on others, i took it out on myself. I would hit myself, and much worse. I tried starving myself. But nothing gave me control. I ended up in a mental hospital for 4 days and got me into treatment. Treatment for me was quite rigorous, i still need it tbh. I was in DBT for 8 months and on meds with it.

I've never denied having bpd though, which is where your mother and i differ.

You cant help someone if they dont acknowledge they even have an issue.

+just because you have bpd doesn't make it an excuse to shit on people.

Yes, i have been toxic and shit to people. But through therapy im learning what is right and what isnt. Your mother may never change her ways without the realization they're toxic.

Sometimes the best you can do, is ignore her. A lot of things will come with that, but living with her im sure you know what to expect, right? Her being very upset, blaming you for her shortcomings. Dont fall for that trap. Many people with bpd are like that, but many arent. Its easy to differentiate after you get to see their behavior.

Anxiety,fqtnehh,t3_gkttro,1589642365.0,"I think the stress of it gave me pancreatitis once. After pancreatitis my insides have not been the same. I get sore in my lower left abdomen often, i cannot press or put any pressure there without it being a sharp pain. You know when you go to the doc and they do the stomach press thing? Yeah, agony.

I have trouble with incontinence too after that.

Im really hoping my pancreas didnt mess up the nerve bundles in there bc my lipase levels were 9000 and i didnt go to the hospital right away, i thought the pain was just gas bubbles or something. I still feel weird in that region. After a day or two, i felt like bees were in my colon, like it was bubbly and vibrating (?) Best way to describe it.

I dont drink alcohol and wasnt on anything but birth control, so idk how i got it. The doctors chalked it up to a fatty diet, but whats funny is at that time i was trying out a diet and i was eating salad, baked chicken, mushrooms, stuff like that. I wasnt eating anything too spicy or compacting in the bowels. So i wasnt necessarily eating things like fast food or fried foods at all. So idiopathic at best.

I had a small bout a couple weeks ago but with bowel rest it helped.

I recommend that if you get pains, try to fast for at least 2 or 3 days. Drink a ton of water, yes you will be ravenously hungry, but that time where your guts get rest will help heal and relax them. Start off eating with broth, jello, light thing, and each day work up to more hearty foods. Stick away from things that are too spicy.

Im sure i should have got it checked out but when i went to my follow up with my regular doctor, they recommended me work on my mental health first and it started a huge thing with going to therapy 2 times a week and having appts with my psychiatrist 1 time a month, so some weeks would have crammed 3 therapy sessions in one.

That would make sense you were sensing the ones that broke off from the majority, especially if they have a sense of protection and honor, for what the believe to be as right.

They may have fled to orion and established a new base or even joined other aliens and interbred if thats even possible, leading to a mixed race that makes it harder to identify."

My BPD gives me all these symptoms alone, plus the pmdd on top, its like a double whammy literally.

But someone without bpd has a lot of similar symptoms if they have just pmdd. Is it purely the emotional aspect or is there really more going on? Who knew emotions could be so negative when you can't control them."

AskReddit,fqmcc33,t3_gjbfui,1589475103.0,"Breakfast burritos.

I cut the potatoes first and cook them with a small amount of vegetable oil in the panjust to prevent sticking until they are slightly done. After adding oil, i use garlic salt, pepper, onions, and a lot of chili powder.

I either add bacon or sausage, but bacon is my favorite. I cut the bacon into chunks and make it a half and half ratio. As the bacon cooks, the potatoes will soak up a lot of the flavor and grease from it. It still gets a bit greasy. I wait until the bacon is cripsy and done.

To use up the grease, i add 3/4 eggs and finish off the tortillas. I scramble the eggs in a bowl and add a few splashes of franks red hot sauce in them. I add them and make sure they absorb the grease. By that time, everything is settled and done.

The best burritos even though its not healthy by a long shot. I love using sharp cheddar cheese when the burrito is hot to bind some of it and then top with green chile salsa and roll that bitch."

raisedbynarcissists,fqm9857,t3_gjhlfw,1589473637.0,"Kinda, more like anything i did was never good enough but they didnt actively put me down.

 I did so good in school for praise, as i got older i did the best possible, all A's and rewards out the ass. Anything less than a 95% was my nightmare. But i never got praise. Just a ""good job"" with empty tone and eyes. When i was younger they threw me $10 or so, but even that faded out. I would get good grades all year hoping for that $10 so i could save to buy things but nah.

My whole identity was the ""academic"" one. I had to be smart or i was useless.

I only got attention by doing good in school. Even then, rarely. Once i graduated, nothing. Because i didnt want to go college immediately i took a gap year, but ended up not wanting to go to college yet bc of my mental health. And that started the journey of healing."
BPD,fqm7k5l,t1_fqm6oqq,1589472844.0,"I'm pretty sure i heard the mom say they've all got some sort of autism, which is horrible. One kid with autism needs so many resources i have no idea how one person can give 3 autistic kids what they desperately need and deserve, because she said her husband does nothing to help. Plus if one kid came out with autism, why keep having kids that may come out the same way? I feel like it is almost immoral. I myself take the responsibility to not have kids because i know they have chances to come out mentally ill and i dont have the knowledge to rear children. Accidents happen, but 3 in a row is harder to dismiss. I couldn't imagine planning to have a child after the first one came out suffering basically.

Its kinda strange because i acknowledge both sides. Having that struggle is something i wouldnt wish on anyone, yet i feel with the husband because if i had kids and didnt expect that outcome. Having kids that are so loud and demanding isnt fun for me for even 30 minutes, i cant imagine being their parents, i would feel like giving up and letting them do whatever. But i wouldnt let my bf do the work alone, if i was their mom i would have resources for them and myself along with dbt for us all."

I had a flip phone with free minutes for calls but only 80 text messages, no data tho so no java web surfing lol. I had to ride a special bus to school cuz i lived so far out and nobody else except 3 kids did, so we ended up using the van from our school to save them money. Most of the time i got to play new games and stuff was kids at school, so i had short times with it and never got the chance to see the internet pre 2015. Which is probably a blessing."
