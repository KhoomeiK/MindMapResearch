EatingDisorders,fqj0txu,t3_givuuy,1589403507.0,"I‚Äôd suggest a therapist. There is usually an unhealthy mental process behind eating disorders (not judging nor shaming, it just is what it is).

When I struggled with eating disorders, I was at my lowest mentally. I had a lot of control issues due to other abuse going on in my life. Once I learned my self worth was not tied to my image and simultaneously started being more social and had more hobbies in my life, I started to regain control. And I learned to enjoy food as a source of fuel for other fun activities. It‚Äôs a long process, but I‚Äôd highly highly suggest a therapist!

Sorry you guys are going through this, I know how eating disorders can wreak havoc on everyone involved. Wishing all the best xo"

Several that I read mentioned hot tea with ginger, lemon and honey so I just passed that info along in case it helps 

I only said sports drinks are better because they contain electrolytes that are difficult to get when you‚Äôre sick and rarely eating, and contain more calories to boost the energy. 

This is the breathing video I watched https://youtu.be/HwLzAdriec0 At the end you do a big cough which can help expel mucus. Not saying it works for everyone, and I‚Äôve never tried it myself"

Lie on your stomach as long as you can everyday.

Practice the breathing technique that‚Äôs gone viral. Even if it is painful, it‚Äôs important to clear your lungs.

HealthAnxiety,fon9tvh,t3_g8cy3v,1587915294.0,"Yes I have this problem too :/ I have a therapist and speaking with her helped a lot. Also, knowing that anaphylaxis will only occur within 20 minutes of being exposed to a substance helped a lot. If I'm having a bad time, I'll just take an extra anti-histamine pill, lay on my couch and watch something distracting and set a timer for 20 min. When 20 min hits, I feel super relieved.

Also, practicing breathwork has helped sooo much. When I actually have allergies or asthma, I can feel my airways constricting, but practicing breathwork has allowed me to identify if my chest is tightening due to anxiety, or if it's actually my airways constricting. I'll take a big, deep breath when I think I'm having an allergy attack, and if the air can go all the way down my lungs, I know I'm fine!

Also, remembering that I can always pop into the ER and receive a shot that will immediately cure me helps. Just focus on your breathing and your conscious awareness that you are safe and have a backup plan if anything goes wrong :)"

CPTSD,fnbvdhj,t1_fnbiqhq,1586823069.0,"Yeah of course, and thanks for sharing! I'm actually surprising myself by saying this, but I used to feel exactly how you're describing. I know just what you mean - the awkwardness of answering everyday questions because it brings up a world of 'unusual' responses in a normal social setting. What really helped me was forcing myself (when I was ready) to get off my couch and start doing things. Being brave and going to that happy hour with coworkers. Meeting a new friend for lunch. Trying to participate in a new club / group in the city. Going out and just exploring on a walk on my own, or trying a new hobby indoors (something as simple as drawing or doing a puzzle). Doing things just really helped me to figure out what I liked and what I might want in the future. Then I started to be able to have responses to everyday questions or conversation - like ""oh yeah, the last time I went on a hike, I got bit by mosquitoes too"" rather than remembering all the hikes I went on with my parents that were miserable. I guess it was sort of like replacing bad memories with good ones by """"re-doing"" things that had bad feelings associated with them, but on my own in an empowering way.

Maybe you can try joining a zoom group online and try playing a game. Or play a board game with a friend in the future. Then maybe your response to ""What was your favorite board game as a kid?"" could potentially turn into a genuine response of, ""Honestly, my family didn't play games all that much, but I recently played X and enjoyed it!""

She would also point people out to me at the park and tell me how ugly they were.

I know it may be sad to not have everyone there, but it might allow better social distancing for those who do come and protect those you care about who are at-risk.

CPTSD,fe06t33,t3_enggmt,1578804542.0,"I think I resonate with most of the other comments on here but also wanted to add that I feel like I know exactly what you‚Äôre describing. And I‚Äôm realizing that my inability to understand what I‚Äôm feeling is largely due to it being an ‚Äúemotional flashback‚Äù (since you mentioned CPTSD I‚Äôm going to assume you know what this is). I too know when I‚Äôm anxious, sad, mad, or happy with day to day things, but when something intense happens with someone close to me, I can frequently flashback into a terrible place and not be able to describe how I‚Äôm feeling at all, but I just know I feel terrible and I‚Äôm unable to physically move for hours sometimes. I don‚Äôt know if this is what you‚Äôre experiencing, but it‚Äôs helped me immensely to know it‚Äôs a flashback, meaning what I‚Äôm feeling are definitely feelings I felt when my mom would scream at me and say terrible things when I was very little. And something in real life triggered me back into those feelings. Most of the time, I am realizing the feelings are terror, shame, and a feeling that I‚Äôm dying or going to die because I‚Äôm not good enough to deserve to live (what my mom would say). Breaking that down when I‚Äôm emotionally ‚Äúsober‚Äù (not in a flashback) with my therapist has helped a ton to be able to cognitively understand what I‚Äôm feeling when I feel it, even though it feels so hazy in the moment.

Also, my therapist too told me I‚Äôm very detached from my feelings. Based on our sessions, she‚Äôs mentioned a number of times it sounds like I had (have?) a dissociative disorder growing up. I think this may also contribute to our inabilities to grasp our emotions. When I flashback, I think I simultaneously dissociate - where I feel absolutely terrible but dissociate enough to survive - where I don‚Äôt feel the severity of the intense and horrible emotions in my flashback but it makes everything quite hazy and still pretty terrible of an experience. But I‚Äôm not bawling my eyes out in horrific pain, which is what my dissociation is protecting me from I think."

Even now buying alcohol at the store - I‚Äôm 25 but I look very young and always internally flinch when I hand the cashier my ID and they scrutinize it for a good minute and look me up and down to see if that‚Äôs really me. ‚òπÔ∏è you made me realize this is something I should bring up to my therapist haha thank you!"

CPTSD,f1k2wjc,t1_f1jzu25,1569531089.0,"Thank you! Yeah so I‚Äôm 25 and have lived in another state than them for a few years. I rarely visit them and don‚Äôt plan on it ever again, now that I‚Äôm cutting out my mom. I hope to talk to my dad more on the phone now. He‚Äôs a pilot so he gets a few consecutive days per week away from my mom where he might feel less hostility from her to talk to me freely. As long as I don‚Äôt hear about it I‚Äôm good. He and I text mostly though. I‚Äôm open to him visiting me more in the future, especially now holidays. I hope you figure it out! I realized I had to go no contact when it got to the point I‚Äôd daydream what it was like to never have to worry about the next conversation she and I would have - would it be emotionally volatile? Would she be pleasant if I pick up the phone? Do I have to visit for xmas? Imagining not dealing with that anymore gave me the most happiness I could imagine. I couldn‚Äôt not cut her out anymore so I just went with it. Took maybe a year to muster up the courage and think everything through. If you want to cut your mom out, you definitely can too (and should)!"
CPTSDmemes,f1jzlxx,t3_d9peng,1569529916.0,Following up (I don‚Äôt know if people comment on their posts on reddit to add something - sorry if this is weird LOL) - but I just realized this whole scene is very relatable. HAHA
CPTSD,f1j4pss,t1_f1idteu,1569518700.0,"Thank you so much. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that though. If you ever need to talk about anything, you are welcome to PM me."
CPTSD,f1j4gbu,t1_f1i0hbd,1569518602.0,"Yes they are. He very much enables her, and I have long recognized how his traumas have allowed him to never speak up for me. I was mad at him for a long time for not speaking up for me when I was little. All I want now is for him to respect my needs, which he is doing. He‚Äôs trying to actively understand, which I‚Äôm really grateful for. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll be able to understand to the extent that he can take those understandings and apply them to his own life (ie, he still justifies how my mom treats him and still says he‚Äôs happy). I‚Äôve lost a lot of hope for a long time now about him realizing this. All I can find solace in now is not talking to my mom, and having my dad be supportive of me in that, and focusing now on the relationship that he and I can have without her. I‚Äôm glad at least that when I am not in the presence of my mom and him together, he is able to treat me how I deserve, without my mom‚Äôs interference or beliefs ruling his mind. And he actively listens with an open mind. This is all I have wanted and could ask for from him."

CPTSD,f1hz4x4,t1_f1giwzz,1569503351.0,Thank you. It took months of mulling it over until I realized I was at the point where not saying something would be more anxiety-provoking than actually saying it haha :)

CPTSD,f0vazfp,t3_d6oc9p,1568973987.0,"Yup! Symptoms were always there but it was the only way I knew life - I didn‚Äôt know any different, so how could I know there was a better way of life?

Then I met my wonderful ex-boyfriend and learned what a healthy relationship was, and it was like realizing all the little things I never had. I mention I‚Äôm tired at 2pm and around 7pm he remembers and tells me to go lay down and he will make dinner for me? I nearly cry thinking about it because it made me realize all the times my mom ‚Äúwas too tired‚Äù to make me dinner so I‚Äôd just go hungry for days, then get blamed for not being considerate of how tired she must be raising a demon child like myself. 

So yes, being in a safe and healthy environment absolutely brought everything into a crushing clarity lol"
AsianParentStories,f0vagfh,t3_d6mnn0,1568973166.0,"Hi- there is a lot to unpack here. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this. I grew up very similarly - now in grad school in the sciences - but on my own choice and not my parents. 

When I was in high school, my parents were very similar and pushed me to take classes I hated. I understand going against your parents wishes may be hard now, but if this helps any ‚Äî I‚Äôve found the most useful and beneficial thing in life is to be a well-rounded person. Maybe this is a given (sorry if I‚Äôm stating the obvious), but it truly is most important to just learn and know things in all areas. It makes you more appealing as an interviewer for a job, and definitely helps in social interactions and networking. Creative writing will hella improve your writing skills which are key in any job! History, philosophy, art, music are all important things that can just overall make you a smarter human being, leading to better decision-making skills in the workplace. Even as a grad student, I‚Äôve been spending free time brushing up on history just so I can have a deeper understanding of the world. Understanding why and how things are the way they are today helps increase creativity and innovation - especially if you‚Äôre interested in business or finance. How do you think large successful corporations rose to power? It takes a strong leader and creative thinking (and a good economy / political sphere) - just overall lots to understand and all knowledge is useful :) 

I totally get if your parents don‚Äôt understand that - but please don‚Äôt let them hold you back. As a PhD student in cancer biology - I can highly recommend taking fun electives such as creative writing over physics. And you don‚Äôt have to publish anything for it to be worth the experience. The skills you will gain in the class will shine through in your college application essays!

I think that if your parents can be convinced, great! If in the past it has been impossible to make them understand, I‚Äôd say just do you and they‚Äôll eventually see that you‚Äôll be the successful person they hoped for. Unfortunately my parents could not change and it significantly damaged our relationship. In my experience - Asian parents can tend to be on the spectrum of narcissism (definitely not all, but a lot more than parents from other cultures in my experience) and if you believe your parents to have these tendencies, they may never understand :/  And please don‚Äôt feel like a failure if you do not live up to a certain standard of success that either you and/or your parents have defined. I felt that way in high school and it significantly (!) held me back. It can lead to an imposter syndrome, and an all-or-nothing black-or-white failure-or-success mentality that stifles productive and efficient self-growth and independence.  It took me years to realize that my obsessions over my grades and getting into good schools was drastically taking away from my genuine enthusiasm of learning and being ‚Äúpresent‚Äù in lectures. If I had stopped worrying about my academic ‚Äústatus‚Äù in school, I would have been much more productive in paying attention and synthesizing information. One grade would not cause me to waste time being down and beating myself up, but rather serve as a healthy reminder to figure out maybe why my studying is not as good as I expected and be excited to improve :)

Be proud of yourself! I know being in high school, there are probably lots of students taking lots of APs and it‚Äôs very competitive. But you‚Äôre in 10/11th grade classes now that‚Äôs fucking awesome! Believe in yourself. The most important thing is to always know that even if a grade or life gets you down, at the end of the day you also have yourself to come back to - a smart, talented writer and student. Never (!) a failure no matter what grade, class, or school you‚Äôre in. Don‚Äôt let your parents ever make you feel any other way. You are an amazing person and never forget that! 

Idk if this helped any but hopefully it did üò≠"

Sorry I didn‚Äôt see this until much after you posted :( but thank you so much. Your response means a lot to me. Thank you for your support. I hope you are doing well in your journey now.

I completely understand your feeling of crumpling under pressure. It‚Äôs been this long and I still haven‚Äôt brought anything up to my parents. But in this time, I‚Äôve managed to find a therapist and write many (MANY) things down lol. My parents are out of the country until next weekend, but I was going to bring things up then. I‚Äôve been suffering panic attacks at the thought of all that might happen - all that might come crashing down on me, and it‚Äôs been difficult for me to work. Especially because my dad plans to visit 4-5 times next month (extended family is all in my city and he‚Äôs a pilot). I just need to dive in and do it. Wishing you best of luck, and thank you again."

CPTSD,eyz2gj9,t1_eyyjexf,1567607993.0,"I‚Äôm finding immense help in psychotherapy - I agree CBT helped me loads for a short period of time, to begin training myself to believe I had worth. But it never got to the source of the issue - psychotherapy (talking things through and identifying patterns that underlie my thoughts that must reside deep in my unconscious) has helped so much !! I can‚Äôt believe it. It has helped me to feel again and identify common themes of my childhood (ie, I believed my existence  was not acceptable to anyone) that manifested as all of the decisions and actions and emotions that I had the rest of my life.
This and Pete Walker‚Äôs books helped break through a lot of my ‚Äúwalled off feelings‚Äù: I‚Äôd highly recommend his ‚ÄúComplex PTSD‚Äù book and ‚ÄúThe Tao or Fully Feeling‚Äù."
