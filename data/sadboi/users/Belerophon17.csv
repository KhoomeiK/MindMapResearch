WhitePeopleTwitter,fqqgiiu,t1_fqq3mej,1589565122.0,"I don't work there anymore. It was a big bank/insurance company. It wasn't all 100% free like we still had to pay for food and daycare and stuff just a lot of it was very discounted (Like $3 for a custom burger or sub, etc.). They relied heavily on office ""culture"" which meant they routinely gave out goodies, prizes, and treats and tried to make things look really hip and progressive. 

They recruited a lot of people directly out of college and convinced them that they were just a cooler version of corporate America. At the end of the day though, it was just a shinier coat of paint on the same kind of car. It was a call center. This meant that they tried real hard to make everything look like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory but the reality was you were constantly stuck going through that scary-ass tunnel every day. If a call came through, you answered it. Sometimes calls would take 3+ hrs if we had to do a mortgage application. If you were scheduled till 8pm and a call came through at 7:59, you were expected to stay until it was done. There were nights I was there until 10-11pm in the dark because they shut all the lights off.

They paid substantially less than smaller competitors and tried to tempt you with a large-ish bonus once a year (13% of your salary routinely). They could have just skipped the bonus though and paid everyone higher wages but that would mean they couldn't A) Earn interest on the money and B) Keep it if the person ended up quitting. It was a carrot on a stick that a TON of people bought into but I was brought in from a completely different industry outside of the snow-globe so I wasn't really willing to drink the kool-aid.

Bathroom breaks were timed. Idle phone and computer activity was timed. IM's would come  through from people on the other side of the country asking why 3 minutes had passed since you answered the phone. Your manager would have to make a point to bring up the 5 minute bathroom break you took so you knew they were aware. Overall, I was a grown ass man paying a mortgage and if I needed to take a bowel movement during the day, I wasn't really willing to be chastised for it during a coaching session.

I ended up leaving on good terms and going back to my original industry for about $15,000 more per year. I didn't have to work nights/weekends anymore and days go by where I don't have to pick up the phone a single time. I miss working with people in my own age group as I predominantly work with old men again but it was a better trade-off in the long run."
WhitePeopleTwitter,fqpvgzj,t3_gk72fr,1589554716.0,"I used to work for a bank that would routinely try to send scam emails to it's employees to catch them up. If the employee clicked the link, their name would be sent to their manager and department director and then they had to take an online class about phishing scams before they could use the actual internet again.

The majority of these things were ridiculously dumb (ie: click this link for free car insurance for life, etc...) but I got caught up one damned time. 

For perspective, the office was more of a campus with a gym, a clinic, fully accredited daycare for your kids, recreation courts, game rooms, meditation rooms, cafe, shop, multi-station grills and salad bars for food. The amenities were absolutely up there. Food trucks came every Thursday, ice cream was served every Friday. You could even use a service that hired an assistant to pick up your dry-cleaning, take you to the airport, take your car to be detailed, etc. for just a few bucks an hour.

I give this information mainly to showcase what a dick move they performed on the one link that got me. ""We're offering a new service where you can schedule food to be directly delivered to your cubicle!"". That was it. I'm like, wow yeah I need that because these calls are pushing me through my break that's awesome! NOPE.

Next thing I know, i'm getting called to meet with my manager and the director to get talked to... I admit. They got me. They offered something so believable I truly thought it was real. Uncool. I didn't feel as bad when I found out they got record clicks on that specific email though."
Fishing_Gear,fqph8ey,t3_gk5z2m,1589546339.0,"Looks like they were made in the early 50's as was stated. The patent was first issued to:  
 Jacob M. Goldberg, of Denver, Colo., on October  
16, 1951 (Pat. no. 2,571,440). Goldberg received at  
least three more patents for his reel, which was  
manufactured by the Magic Fishing Reel Co., a  
subsidiary of Goldberg Brothers Manufacturing Co.,  
Denver. 

Some information on [Goldberg Brothers](https://goldbergbrothers.com/) itself:  
 Established in Denver in 1897 as a family-owned tinsmith shop, Goldberg Brothers is best known for manufacturing motion picture film reels and movie theater projection ports. Â The company began building steel barn door hardware for interior sliding doors in 2012. More than 20 employees work at its Reel Factory building in the Ken-Caryl Business Center in Littleton. 

As far as the reel itself apparently it could be used for spinning, fly casting, bait casting and trolling and came in a red velvet draw string pouch. Value is not very well known as there is very little information.

I was not by any means a spectacular looking guy with chiseled features. They didn't care. They cared that I treated them like they were people instead of just kids to shovel around from place to place getting talked down to. That I was honest with them and listened. That I was fair. 

They also cared that I was in touch with the same things they were in touch with and could engage with them on. I grew up with pokemon and backstreet boys, comic books, and played video games. If I didn't know then I asked them what it was and the words would just flow from their mouths because they were excited to teach someone something they thought was really cool.

There were times in every group where a student or a few students would get on a high horse or feel like because we were chummy that they could cross certain lines and misbehave. Just had to be direct, stern, and consistent with where those boundaries were. I explained what they did and why exactly they were reaping consequences for their actions. It didn't hurt to ask them how they could avoid those same actions in the future.

ender5,fqddhy5,t3_gi676y,1589287181.0,"The only information I would tell you to accurately take away from the responses in this thread is to realize that each answer is talking about a different brand of silky filament so you can see how widely the brands differ from one another. Take the ""absolutes"" with a large grain of salt.

My personal experience:

I use an unbranded purple silk filament from Amazon on my stock printer (1.75 on 0.4 nozzle). It's no less brittle than regular PLA and it runs on my stock machine with no nozzle degradation to date. I had to crank my temperature up to 212 as anything lower and prints would fail every single time. The key to this stuff is to do multiple small test calibration prints to find the sweet spot.

It's not going to be as strong as PLA+ but that's kind of the point of PLA+ in general. I still wouldn't have any issues using the silky filament for bed struts and the like as all mine are Amazon basics white PLA (super cheap stuff). I just made sure to give it 3 walls and at least 60% gyroid infill and they've been doing fine for at least a year now.

The silky stuff is great if you find the brand that works for you. It even looks a bit like glitter when printed with Cura's fuzzy skin feature:

3DprinterHelp,fpnvf21,t3_ge7bay,1588773385.0,"So from looking into the Micro3D printer, the comments on their kickstarter page are not particularly favorable in regards to the quality control or practices of the company in general which isn't all that uncommon for crowd funded 3d printers. I'm not stating that to discourage you, I just want you to be aware.

The first thing I would do is make sure you are trying to print at the right temperature for the filament you're using. Companies usually have it printed on their spool label or box.

I would also double check that your hotend is clear and functioning by preheating your printer and trying to manually feed filament through the nozzle. If melted filament is feeding through, then you at least know the issue doesn't lie with your heater cartidge or thermistor. 

I would then take the opportunity to make sure that your extruder is functioning correctly. Make sure it isn't slipping or skipping or grinding the filament. If the extruder isn't working, make sure it's plugged in to your control board and that there isn't a short and that the feeding gear isn't worn. The board might also have a bad driver.

If filament does not come through when you manually try to feed it, you have a blockage for some reason. You're going to need to try to do a pull, or remove the nozzle and replace it, or clear it with some needle nose pliers. Depending on the type of hotend equipped on this thing, it could be that the bowden tube was not inserted flush into the hotend  as far as it would go and the melted filament just seeps into the gap causing a clog.

That's about as far as I can think in regards to your printer. Sorry you have to deal with this, we've all been there and no matter how ""consumer proof"" companies want to tout their printers, there will ALWAYS be tinkering and detective work to fix problems. 

If by the end of all this, you're at your wits end or the company wants to charge you an arm and a leg for replacement parts shipped from Slovenia or wherever they are, I wouldn't put the money into it to be honest. Their facebook page has an email screenshot of someone being quoted a nozzle at $9 and shipping said nozzle for $135.00. Their shop shows a lot of specialized parts that you HAVE to get from them which honestly sucks. Your money would be better spent on an Ender 3 for a very similar cost and a much larger support community and less proprietary materials. That's just my opinion though. Best of luck!"

Other than that little hiccup it was an extremely quick install and I didn't have to flash anything and the sound reduction still blows my mind."
NoStupidQuestions,fndi0pz,t3_g0wa02,1586870457.0,"Youngest of five here all biological. My parents were by no means wealthy. My mom ran a home daycare and my dad worked at a call center for a telecomm company (less than 100k per year for them combined easily most likely closer to 70-80k). We lived in a small house with 3 bedrooms, a re-purposed garage, and 2 baths. 

My parents worked magic every day of my life. They scraped by, and went without, to make our lives possible. My dad lost his job twice due to layoffs and we still had dinner on the table (albeit a much more creative version). We had generic clothes on our backs and our big night out every once in a while was a family dinner at Burger King on a Friday night. Life was like someone shoved a bunch of angry cats in a small cardboard box. There was screaming, fighting, blood, and bruises. The pain hurt bad. The good times were great. A therapist most likely should have intervened at points.

I wouldn't worry about how many kids your BF wants. You don't have to commit to anything and I can assure you after the first one, you'll know if you can handle a second and that cycle continues. Is it possible to afford a large family like that? Absolutely! Does it take it's toll on your relationship with your significant other? Absolutely. You don't want to sacrifice who you are as a person and who you are as a couple because your partner wants to play a numbers game so just make sure you're heard and are both on the same page going in."

3dprinter,fm7ptc9,t3_ftc4e4,1585834057.0,"If you're looking for N scale model sizes you're going to want to go with a resin printer. Anycubic Photon, or the Elegoo mars will be your best bet for your price point. The Mars takes less to get the plate level, and has stronger UV array I believe and I really enjoy mine. I also find their customer support is substantially better than Anycubic in my own personal experience but either will work.

Be prepared for a few things:

1. You will at some point need to replace parts on your printer (LCD screen, FEP film, even the vat) so be prepared to open it up at some point because all of those things are prone to wear out after a while. This is the case for resin or FDM.
2. There will at some point be a need to tinker with some settings and learning how to properly support your models.
3. The cost is a little higher than FDM with the supplies needed (gloves, resin, washing agent, curing station, etc...). Some resins are more expensive than others especially if you splurge on the stronger resins for print durability.
4. Ventilation is a wise idea and should be fine in your wife's craft room. Mine is in my office in a closed cabinet that has a vent to a nearby window. I prefer to not be in the room when I print regardless though. Some resins smell more than others so consider an inline fan in your ventilation setup.
5. Resin takes a lot more focus on safety protocol. Some people have negative reactions if the resin touches their skin and it can cause burns and other issues. You have to establish a stringent cleaning process to handle this stuff safely. Be smart. Be vigilant.

There are a ton of groups available to help you figure out a process but resin is very accessible these days. It's daunting to look into but there are Facebook communities focused on miniature printing that help you troubleshoot, figure out supports, and learn about what works and what doesn't. One suggestion I have is to look at tabletop gaming 3d printer groups and you will see that the majority of them swear by resin for the detail.

IPA is not the only agent around to wash your prints. Some people use acetone, mean green cleaner, some use soap and water (they make water washable resin), and some even us windshield washer fluid. There are options that are available and cost effective.

I'm not knocking FDM but for what you're trying to do and what you've listed, it doesn't seem like the better choice. You want something that's going to be mostly workable out of the box and I own 3 FDM printers (Anycubic, Creality, and Monoprice) and **all** of them have required fine tuning, tinkering, and fiddling to get them to work to the level I want. They don't do small details better than resin because you're essentially drawing with a melted strand of plastic where resin is going layer by layer. The N scale precision is not going to be there like it will with resin unless you spend a ton of time fine tuning your printer and even then you may never get it.

I use rustoleum rattle can primer and the models from either method and never had an issue. FDM will show layer lines more prominently than resin though once painted just as a note. Even at a low resolution, if you put a wash on it you will see the lines somewhat.

I mean Miami-Dade county is topping the charts of cases at a whopping 2,202 but even out of that many only 36 are non-residents. This obviously doesn't single out New York as requested but there's not much of that data to go off of at the moment.

DeSantis made the argument that closing the borders and shutting everything down would only cause people to flee to other states and spread the infection that way but there has never been any data to really back that up. It seems more like an excuse than anything else to pass the buck so that when the economy falls on hard times, it can't be totally blamed on him."

Meanwhile, we were there as Mom and Dad for his first words, Christmas, birthday, his first steps. I still remember the day we had to drop him off at daycare so his uncle could pick him up for the last time and hearing him cry as we left knowing we were powerless. We pulled into a restaurant parking lot down the street and just broke down. I have over 650 photos and videos in my Google drive and that day is when Google decided to send me one of their automated montages titled ""They grow up so fast"". Fuck.

It's been a year now. I still have dreams about him on a weekly basis like it was just yesterday he was chasing me around with a bucket on his head or stomping the shit out of my tupperware. The only way to describe it is to imagine that a family is like a car and each time they have a kid the car spontaneously grows another wheel and moves a bit more like it's supposed to. When you lose that wheel though, the framework is still there but now it's just kind of dragging along. Like you still feel like a parent, all those instincts and everything is still there, except now there's no kid. 

After a year, i'm still torn up. I've dealt with increased anxiety issues, and depression off and on but i'm making it.
