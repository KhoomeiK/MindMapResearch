AskPsychiatry,fqy4fsv,t3_glidxe,1589742419.0,"I'm not in psychiatry, but I resonate with this post a lot. As a woman who grew up as a tomboy nicknamed princess and made to wear dresses, I have wondered if I was transexual as an adolescent.

I wish I had known earlier that it's okay for a woman to have more masculine preferences and tendencies and still be a woman. I don't have to be a man to enjoy traditionally masculine hobbies, or to be heard and taken seriously.

There is so much media directed at young children that perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes. I grew up despising the feminity depicted in television shows and movies. The message I heard was that women are shallow. Women are petty. Women are too sensitive. Women like shopping. Women like make-up. It seemed to me that because I didn't identify with this, maybe I'm not a woman.

I never interacted with the LGBT community in my pre-pubescent or early teenage years, so I don't know if my life would have been much different from how it is now if I had.

I don't know your child enough to suggest any course of action for you, but I hope my experience gives you some insight. Maybe respectfully share your thoughts, but let them explore and experiment with their identity without any shame or judgement. Early pubescence can be a very tumultuous and confusing time, both physically and mentally. I wish you the best in raising your child."
