BipolarReddit,fpd7ewq,t1_fpd6bui,1588521383.0,"Agreed!!!!  We are all human and will have ups and downs. Yes, we have bipolar disorder. But saying I am bipolar makes it sound like a defining trait. It's not. It is just something we have to deal with."
BipolarReddit,fpd77hy,t3_gcrsy7,1588521261.0,I agree with this list. I would say medication and sleep have made a huge difference in my life and help keep me stable.
BipolarReddit,fodxaon,t3_g6ydx4,1587691886.0,"The world would not be better without you. People would mourn. There would be a hole in their lives that would never fully go away. I'm so sorry you are going through this. Please know it will get better.  I know it sounds trite but it's true. The bad times don't last forever. Think of the people you love. Reach out to them. Honestly, the only way I got out of high school without killing myself was to think about what would happen to my mom if I did. What she would look like when she found me. I'm 43 now with two grown children,  a husband, two dogs, and a cat. My life is far from perfect, but I would not have it any other way. Things will improve. You have no idea what life has in store for you. Hugs to you. You're a survivor. You've got this"
BipolarReddit,fodvl9e,t3_g6u28e,1587690956.0,"I drink but I don't take a mood stabilizer. I am on seroquel which I know reacts to it. But i don't overindulge. A glass or two of wine or a couple of beers. I haven't noticed depression from drinking but it is harder to wake up in the morning. Of course I'm going on 18 years since I started taking meds. So I'm pretty stable. Bottom line, it would be better if you didn't. But it's your choice. You have to make the best decision for your life."
BipolarReddit,fjo7xlr,t1_fjc7syz,1583522364.0,Oh yeah!  It's the worst.
BipolarReddit,fjbvey0,t3_fcncc3,1583202282.0,I have been on that combo before. We ended up adding abilify because I was still getting overly depressed.
BipolarReddit,fj2nupd,t3_faxptx,1582948624.0,I went off lamictal with my doctors help. I still take seroquel and abilify. I would never have gone off it on my own tho. I am very strict about taking my meds and have been since diagnosed 17 years ago.
cisparenttranskid,fi5sn68,t3_et9djj,1582169786.0,"I'm sorry. It seems like this is going to be a tough conversation to have. I had a hard time accepting my daughter was trans at first. She was 16 when she came out to me. I just could not believe it. She showed zero signs. I found out later that was by design. She knew and hated the feminine side of herself so much that she hid it from the world. But at the end of the day, I really really love that kid. I love both of my children. I did everything I could to understand what she was going through. Now if her dad accidentally calls her ""he"" I get all sorts of pissed off. Even though she is away at college and cannot hear him.  It sounds like you might need to do some educating of your parents. And family counseling might be a good way for you all to get support. I know if my daughter didn't have an amazing counselor I don't know where we would be now.  Sending you all the love and support. Hugs."
BipolarReddit,fi4spea,t1_fi4ccce,1582147670.0,Anytime! :)
BipolarReddit,fi3h0el,t3_f5xlc6,1582118652.0,"If she is having memory issues, that could be the reason for her behaviour. Maybe. I don't know her. I do know that my Grandpa at 95 was nothing like my grandpa at 85. People change as they age, and not always for the best. I applaud you for stepping up and being there when she needs it. She may never act appreciative and may continue to hurt your feelings. But the woman you loved, who raised you, is still in there somewhere. Blessings to you for being so good to her. I do encourage you to find a way to take care of yourself. Caregiving is so hard. I'm sending you a virtual hug internet stranger."
offmychest,fhqlt33,t3_f4enfb,1581806440.0,You are awesome!  Women need allies (women and men) to step in sometimes. Sounds like you handled this situation well. Kudos to you
offmychest,fhqlhbq,t3_f45txu,1581806307.0,You are awesome for recognizing how great they are at a young age!  I am the older sister and I never appreciated my younger sister till I was grown. Keep up the good attitude kiddo!  It will serve you well in life.
BipolarReddit,fgsx6ts,t3_f04cs6,1581094513.0,Agreed. And the term is thrown around a lot. Like the weather is so bipolar. So annoying.
cisparenttranskid,fgfxn48,t3_ey9ri8,1580749839.0,It takes some time to get used to. I 100% support my trans daughter. Up to going against my own parents because they are not supportive. I love my kid and would do anything for her. But there was a mourning period for me. I gained a daughter. But I lost a son. There is a transition period for parents too. You need to allow them time to wrap their heads around the situation. I am not playing the victim.
cisparenttranskid,fczt7ba,t1_fczqk5u,1578108198.0,True. People can show their true colors. I should have specified that this was a work friend. Probably wouldn't have come to our house. I hope he makes some new friends this year too.
cisparenttranskid,fczanm2,t1_fcyk4d6,1578097079.0,That's a good way to go about it. Thanks for the support!  Hugs
offmychest,fbm0bp8,t1_fbk5htm,1576974947.0,"I call my trans daughter and her brother you guys. She doesn't mind and has told me it's used so often, it's pretty gender neutral. I wouldn't worry about it."
BipolarReddit,f7q9ve2,t3_dxbi1v,1573960842.0,"I've been on seroquel for about 13 years at least. I take 200 mg at night. Despite its side effects,  it has been a miracle drug for me. I know my life would be so much harder without it. Like other people are saying, I urge you to find a new doctor and get off it only with help. It can be very very bad to just stop taking it. Your body is used to it now."
cisparenttranskid,f7aq4xs,t3_duq9tu,1573536189.0,"It was a little hard to give up on my daughter's dead name. I fought her dad tooth and nail when it came to naming her. I tried to get her to choose her middle name which was unisex but she wanted something closer to her old name.  She did end up keeping both (yes she has two) middle names that we named her as they fit the new gender. It's been over 6 months since her name change was official and I don't even think of her as her old name anymore. Like others have said, this is about you, not your parents. It gets easier in time. Much love to you on your journey."
cisparenttranskid,f5snrou,t1_f5rxn4r,1572437976.0,They are excluding themselves is a great way to put that. Thank you for the input and suppoet!
BipolarReddit,f5ru6m8,t1_f5rq4h3,1572403120.0,Whew!  Glad I'm not the only one
CisparentsTranskids,f5rsjvd,t1_f5gfhk3,1572401955.0,"I second this. Find a counselor who can help navigate this with your child. My daughter (previously son) showed no outward signs in childhood either. The counseling at first was just to find out if it was real. It was. I'll tell you, now that she's actually transitioned she is so much happier with herself and life in general. Much love to you and your kiddo."
BipolarReddit,f5rnwi2,t3_doug1j,1572398780.0,"How on some days, I just can't. I work full time and part of my job is to call people. I hate this portion of my job but I suck it up and do it. But sometimes I just can't. I can't handle it. I know it's the bipolar and I tell myself to get over it. But calling people who aren't expecting my call and might not appreciate it, is sometimes overwhelming. Also how I get unreasonably cranky. I don't mean anything by it. I don't hate you. Even if I'm thinking in my head that you're a major bitch. I don't really think that. This illness has a mind of it's own sometimes. Sorry if that doesn't make a lot of sense. Just my experience."
offmychest,f5qnrg6,t1_f5qlphg,1572380067.0,"If she could, S would adopt her. She is an amazing aunt. 

Pedophiles and rapists are allowed to have and be around their own children Unfortunately. Unless the kids were his victims"
BipolarReddit,f3g0zgk,t3_dgq0xh,1570905960.0,Yes. But I always thought that was a side effect of my mental breakdown. I do feel less intelligent. But I get sanity which I'm so grateful for.
BipolarReddit,f355fwc,t3_dfq9qc,1570668881.0,Yep. I've been medicated for 15 years. I'm thankful for the meds. They allow me to live a fairly stable life.
cisparenttranskid,f3555me,t3_dfq0ez,1570668676.0,"My kid just sat me down and said I need to talk to you. I think I might be trans. What followed was me saying I loved her no matter what. Then we took her to a bunch of counseling with an LGTBQ friendly therapist. She didn't actually transition until college. She was 16 when she told me. She wrote a letter to her grandparents to tell them. Everyone has been surprisingly supportive. She now lives as a girl with a new driver's license, SS card, and birth certificate. And she's happier than ever which is what really matters to me. Good luck to you!  I hope it goes well"
cisparenttranskid,f0lkj2m,t1_f0kruuk,1568721558.0,Dude you are blinded by your hatred of something you know nothing about. And obviously have no interest in learning about. Also my child is an adult so she can't be taken away
cisparenttranskid,f0kmuev,t3_d4vzj1,1568682945.0,"My child has never been as happy as she is now, living the life she always wanted to live. Yes, she is in HRT with plans of surgery. You don't know these children and what they go through in life. If she could have in any way lived as a boy, she would have. She isn't stupid. She knows the statistics of violence against people like her.  She knew her life would be harder just because of who she is.  But she was not happy as a boy. I am proud of her and proud to be her mom. You don't know what you are talking about. You haven't lived her life or our lives as parents. So either try to learn or go away."

They seem like great people."
relationship_advice,f0a83t1,t3_d48n6d,1568511697.0,"As most people have said, she's being overly dramatic. Pregnancy is a wonderful thing right?  I would just apologize in the way of ""I didn't mean to hurt your feelings"" and cook for her for a few days.  Rub her feet. Be extra nice.  I remember being pregnant and freaking out crying because it was going to take the pizza 45 minutes to get to us. These things happen. She'll get over it."
BipolarReddit,f0a6lph,t3_d4dsf8,1568511206.0,Loved them!!!  I really related to a lot of their songs too. But then they took a break. And kicked out the lead singer. Didn't even tell him. They just released an album without him.  I've refused to listen to their stuff since.  He's on his own now. I think his name is Shem or Shim something. He came to our town this summer in concert.
relationship_advice,f0901oy,t3_d45gyi,1568491252.0,She needs to apologize. And get that psychopath into counseling. He's 16 not 6. He knows and should be able to control his actions. Very disturbing.
BipolarReddit,f05yj1m,t3_d3uawp,1568423537.0,Don't do it. You said you had loving friends and family. What would that do to them?  Reach out to someone. And if you aren't in therapy find someone to talk to. Life is hard. And it's especially hard when you have illness and it takes over your life. But life can be beautiful too. I was suicidal in high school. The thought of my mother's face when she found me dead kept me going. Now I have two amazing kids and an awesome husband. Life can be bleh sometimes. But I'm so glad I'm still here. Hugs internet stranger. You can do this.

BipolarReddit,ev72ms6,t3_cicfyf,1564254459.0,"I agree. Summer is rough for me. The one real, horrible episode I had was in summer. It was 17 years ago but you don't forget these things. Whenever I get any type of mania I worry that I'm going to spiral out of control again. So it might feel good to others but not to me."
BipolarReddit,eunrfwf,t3_ch1f16,1563932511.0,My suggestion is get back on your meds. That is a dangerous way to lose weight. Start exercising. It can help your mood and help you lose weight. It's a struggle with mental illness. But purposely messing with your meds isn't doing you any favors.
BipolarReddit,eune1j3,t3_cgyu2k,1563927591.0,It's easy to start feeling this way. Cut yourself some slack. They may care more than you realize.

What you say now could very well stick with them forever. Please keep doing what you are doing. They need someone who cares about them. Much love and respect
cisparenttranskid,eucmxv0,t3_bspou3,1563679845.0,I'm with you. If someone is homo or trans phobic they have no place with me. My daughter is trans. She came out to us in high school but didn't transition until college. She has really become so much happier and self assured now that she is living the life she wants. We live in a very conservative state but she's been lucky and so have we in that our friends and family have been understanding.  Her dad has a rough time calling her she sometimes but he's making progress. We all are. In a couple of weeks we are getting pedicures together and she's getting her ears pierced. Just fun mother daughter things I never thought I would get to do when I thought I had two boys. Much love to you and your family.
offmychest,eucg0fh,t3_cfsrbm,1563674024.0,That's awesome!!!  I've gone from 18 to 6 mg but can't seem to go lower. But I did smoke for 17 years tho. At this point I'm just happy to not smell like cigs anymore.
confession,euc287r,t3_cfq1gl,1563663066.0,Sounds to me like your mom is using you.  I'm sorry you feel like you can't say no to her. You should not feel bad. Your dad doesn't sound like he's helping.

BipolarReddit,etdxrnc,t3_cb2oa1,1562717877.0,I feel like being manic is almost like being on drugs. You have very little control. Some people like that. But I'm with you. I hate it so so much. Yes depression is absolutely terrible. But mania is too. And as my doctor said what goes up must come down. And down is usually way way down. I take my meds faithfully and always worry when I think I'm getting manic.
BipolarReddit,estwnq4,t3_c8xai5,1562274459.0,I had the same problem with lamictal. I ended up being able to go off it with my doctor's help. Now I don't take any mood stabilizers. Just Seroquel and abilify. But I've been ok!  My husband still takes it because he isn't stable enough to remove it from his cocktail. He also has memory problems. I think it's a pretty common issue with that medication.
relationship_advice,ep25b85,t3_btk2ek,1559002213.0,"This sounds like my Mom when I was growing up. It was very damaging. But the worst thing is that my Dad only stood up for me one time. I was probably around 5. But I remember it so well. She told him not to tell her how to raise her child. And so he backed down. He never did that again. He just let her treat me (and to a lesser degree, my sisters) like crap. As long as you are with her I suggest you continue to stand up for your kids. They will remember and appreciate it always."
cisparenttranskid,eohhu40,t1_enejic9,1558581959.0,I second this. A good therapist can help you both out.

offmychest,eohfx0d,t1_eohekwc,1558580521.0,Cold sores are from the herpes virus. Just on your mouth. They can become the other kind with mouth to genital contact. A lot of people do have them but that is why they are being discussed as an STD. Hope this helps!
