reddeadredemption2,fpwi1or,t1_fpwh69f,1588963813.0,Thanks for the response! Do you mean my game progress or my ultimate edition content? I just want to be able to get the special edition horse and clothing again.
reddeadredemption2,fnel5ch,t1_fnekcv7,1586891319.0,Check out some tutorials. I think some times of day are luckier than others. But I definitely think foxtrotter and turkoman are the best horses.
reddeadredemption2,fnek8jo,t1_fnejmud,1586890858.0,You can also get the silver dapple foxtrotter as early as chapter 2 I think. It’s arguably the best horse in the game. Check out some videos on YouTube.
reddeadredemption2,fnej84c,t3_g1b3zg,1586890345.0,"Look up how you can get the dark bay turkoman in chapter 3, it’s an exploit but it’s awesome because you have a nice little Braithwait brand on it too."

AskReddit,f0vb5f2,t3_d6hyci,1568974256.0,Guy at my school was super popular because he was from Australia. Turned out he was faking his accent for an entire year. He got exposed when someone from his previous school transferred to ours. He ended up being the senior who only hung out with freshmen.

BPD,euhxj6w,t3_cgedfm,1563836143.0,"My brother has BPD but hasn’t realized or admitted it yet. He lives abroad but his relationships with the family are strained to say the least. As a sibling I feel nothing but sympathy for him and will do what I can to always be there for him emotionally. I have set clear boundaries about topics I don’t want to discuss — mostly events from the past he wants to revisit all the time — and I think this has helped avoid full on fights. He is my brother and I love him, and if he would show the self-reflection you have I would be really happy. Reading posts from all the people who suffer from BPD has really shaken me. The turmoil and pain is something that just seems like such a burden and I feel so bad for him despite everything he’s put the family through. From my own experience, I don’t see his BPD as what defines him but rather a burden he has to bare. Know that even in the worst times I have always loved my brother, as I’m sure your siblings do to. Your mother’s words are really hurtful and you’re justified to be hurt by them. Even if there is some truth that your siblings might find life a little easier without you in their life always, that doesn’t mean they don’t love you and want you to be healthy and happy.

I wish you all the best."
BPD,euenlts,t3_cfy198,1563748948.0,"Hi thank you for sharing. For a long time I didn’t know what was wrong with my older brother — eventually I read about BPD and everything made sense. I’m just wondering how you became self aware, and if there’s anything I can do to help my brother see this.

Also, you should know that knowing my brother has issues made me feel nothing but love and sympathy for him. I would hate to think that he could feel worthless because of his disorder. He is by far one of the most brilliant and amazing people I know and I love him despite all the madness our family has been through because of his problems. I hope you can separate a mental disorder from the person you are. Yes, it is a part of you, but it is not the totality of your person.

Any advice on how to talk to my brother would be greatly appreciated."
