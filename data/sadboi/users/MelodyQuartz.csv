mentalhealth,fqv7e1i,t1_fqv4kvf,1589671372.0,Yeah maybe go see a professional. I'm not an expert but this could be linked to either those or some other disorder? Idk..
mentalhealth,fqv3va7,t1_fqv39zm,1589669345.0,Erm.. Have you had intense anxiety attacks? That could be something.. Again I'm not a professional so talking to a trained therapist is the best idea
mentalhealth,fquzv4n,t1_fquyq8m,1589667087.0,Oh.. I might have that oop-
mentalhealth,fquu0hz,t1_fqutjb6,1589664556.0,Oh.. No? Can you give me a definition? I've heard of it I think but idk
nosleep,fqutwwp,t3_gkztwf,1589664509.0,Well this was a story that I have never red before o.0
mentalhealth,fquss6a,t1_fqusakt,1589664035.0,"I'm actually not a religious person but usually the only thing that saves me from doing these things is ""Charlie"" who ends up arguing with ""Cameron"" Although it rarely happens that ""Cameron"" will say these things he will usually shut up about it later and go back to his grumpy self. Thanks for the advice tho ^^"
mentalhealth,fqus9pz,t1_fqurxh6,1589663807.0,I'll try my best  (I do acknowledge that these people don't exist since they told me themselves) I also hope your anxiety gets better ^^
mentalhealth,fqury9w,t3_gkvjak,1589663674.0,It's kind of hard to say since I'm in the same situation with my mom too. Maybe ask her to seek help with a professional such as a therapist? It could really help her and maybe even you.
mentalhealth,fqurkgn,t3_gl2en3,1589663502.0,I assume it might have something to do with certain trauma or depression but I'm not a professional so I can't say much. I suggest to go talk with a professional like a therapist about your situation. (And I also suggest to do it online because of the Covid 19 situation)
mentalhealth,fqur8qa,t1_fquqmse,1589663356.0,I agree with alot of your points but I'm personally most worried about Cameron. He seems to be hostile to those who anger him (Which is easy) and will usually tell me things to do to them that are obviously illegal. Like harm them in a way. It just kind of worries me a little.
mentalillness,fqunjju,t3_gkpmfn,1589661729.0,Truth lmao ðŸ˜‚
Vent,fquiwy4,t3_gk5s27,1589659680.0,Aww your grandpa is so nice! I'm sorry my heart can't take this beauty-
Mentalillnesstalk4u,fquicet,t3_g8pts0,1589659424.0,I advice you try to talk to a professional or a loved one. I hope this helps a little!
mentalillness,fqhzbzt,t3_givn1n,1589387186.0,I'm not sure if this is the best advice (I'm not great at advice) but I would recommend maybe covering the windows so you don't see light? That's what kept me awake when I couldn't sleep. The fear that if I don't sleep I'll never see the light again. These thoughts were very hard to ignore but trust me things will get better.

F*ck them."
