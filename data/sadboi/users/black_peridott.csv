In my opinion, if there is anyone to blame it's your parents."

Plus If you mess up the worse that could happen would be them not calling you back. It won't be a big deal, don't worry, if you don't pass you will get other opportunities. For your phone situation I am sure your dad was happy to give it to you. He wouldn't have done it if he didn't."
