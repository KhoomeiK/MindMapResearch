Anxiety,fqriou1,t1_fqr5vp2,1589585136.0,"While these numbers seem high, it's important to note that nearly 50% of deaths in Indiana have been from 80+ years old. Over 92% of deaths from 65 and older. I imagine a large amount of these hospitalizations consist of this population.

Adding to this: Indiana Department of Health admitted this week that many of their negative tests were actually positive (about 30% false negatives). Plus the revelation that Indiana has had 7.5 times more cases than originally thought means that hospitalizations aren't too bad (all things considered).

So while Holcomb is reporting nearly 5,000 hospitalizations with 19% of patients, 5,000 with IU's survey about the added cases makes hospitalizations around 2.6%.

edit: Misread the article. Adjusted percentages."
