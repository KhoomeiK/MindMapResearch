madisonwi,f6qz97a,t1_f6qyq2p,1573089750.0,"I have a valid South Dakota learner's permit but never had anyone teach me how to drive. I've had people promise they would and then they never did. My dad also screwed me out of driver's ed when I was in high school. I know living in Madison I should probably try to get one but I can't realistically get one before starting work. I currently am in San Jose and it hasn't been as much of a problem here since I was just taking the lightrail to work. We also have the Amtrak, Caltrain,and BART train here in addition to buses and Uber pool is a thing here. The opportunity I got though is too good of an opportunity to pass up just because of my lack of transportation."
cscareerquestions,f6ptloa,t3_dsgyv7,1573063988.0,"People working at a FAANG not only get paid more because it's a FAANG but also because all of the FAANG locations are in high cost of living areas (The bay area, Seattle area,New York City). Places in Silicon Valley are always going to pay more than a place in a low COL area. My first FTE role out of college I started at 95000 in San Jose. When I got laid off a month and a half ago my salary was 97000. I just accepted an offer in Middleton,WI for 85000. Yes that number is less but when you factor in the COL difference I am technically making more. According to COL calculators on the internet 85000 in Middleton,WI is like 128000 in San Jose."
bipolar,f6h9f6y,t3_draagz,1572840348.0,"I once took a leave of absence from a job in part because I was depressed because my cat died. Like I can't function and do anything other than watch tv depressed. I couldn't do my job and just wanted to cry. And it wasn't the typical week of someone crying about a lost pet or family member; I was crying for months. I have another cat still and while I love them they obviously aren't the same cat. It didn't help that my cat was too young to die(7) and I felt responsible for it. They were being treated for an upper respiratory infection and I was also told they had heart disease so they were given medicine for that as well. They stayed at the vet for a bit to get their medication via injection (my now ex-boyfriend took them there while I was asleep and left them at the vet because they were doing open mouth breathing and the vet said to bring back if they started doing that). Since they were sick and not drinking enough water the heart disease meds made them constipated so then they had be given medication for that. Their upper respiratory infection seemed to go away for a bit but then came back so I was given more amoxicillin for them. On the last day my poor kitty was around I'm pretty sure he suffered a stroke as when he would try to walk he would fall over. 

I have also been sent home from work for crying openly at the workplace. This was during a time that there were major layoffs that triggered depression.

Long story short if you are going to be crying at work or just in general not feeling well enough to perform your job it's fine to just stay home. I definitely feel embarrassed if I start crying in public."
bipolar,f6h736y,t3_dracu5,1572838597.0,"If there are differences in a bipolar person's blood vs a person without bipolar would it not be possible to accurately diagnose bipolar with a blood test? Bipolar has similarities to other disorders and isn't always accurately diagnosed. I was originally diagnosed with ADHD and depression then another doctor said bipolar while another doctor said I wasn't bipolar at all but have Asperger's and the most recent doctor is saying bipolar again. I also have been diagnosed with PMDD. Getting a proper diagnosis is important to getting proper treatment. I'm worried because my little brother was recently diagnosed with depression, ADHD, and PTSD and he is 16. He is on an anti-depressant and a ADHD medication but they aren't really helping him as far as I know and if it's bipolar they won't help him. My one sister who is 17 was also recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. She tried to commit suicide while on Zoloft and got switched to Prozac but is still depressed. My other sister who is 25 was diagnosed with OCD a while back and I have an aunt who also was diagnosed with OCD and I myself obsess over things and know its part of bipolar so I wonder if their diagnoses or mine is even right as I know all of these disorders have similar or shared symptoms. It would be nice if we could all get blood tests to check for bipolar."
bipolar,f6gux2j,t1_f6fz63c,1572831105.0,SSRIs are bad for people with bipolar because they can cause a manic episode. That's why psychiatrists typically only prescribe mood stabilizers and antipsychotics to people with bipolar disorder and if they do prescribe an SSRI it's always with a mood stabilizer.
cscareerquestions,f5xsb0y,t1_f5xkhdr,1572545522.0,"Exactly. On my resume, I have links to pages on my portfolio for projects I worked on at jobs and then I have videos and screenshots for ones that I am able to show off. For all of my personal projects, I have videos and screenshots as well as links to them on Github/Bitbucket(one of my projects was a game jam project and we used Bitbucket for it) as well as links to download them from my dropbox or google drive. Not many people will take the time to build and try out a project, also a lot of projects won't even get tested so having a video on a portfolio site is good."
cscareerquestions,f5vtima,t3_dpb8om,1572499516.0,"I started at 11. I learned HTML and CSS from the mods on Nickelodeon's forums and also from reading tutorials on other websites. I also began teaching myself Visual Basic at 11. I made some simple text programs with Visual Basic and I made some websites with HTML and did some cool blurred and glittery text things on the Nickelodeon forums. In highschool at 14 and 15, I took Computer Science courses where we did Java. In my Junior year, I took a Digital Design and Multimedia class. I made a website in Dreamweaver where I was supposed to use the design tools to make a website but I asked if I could do it all in custom HTML and CSS instead. My teacher said that I could but that they wouldn't be able to help me. I made this awesome website about Peter Molyneux with a purple glittery background because that's what I wanted. I later made another website with another tool about Will Wright since we had to make websites about well-known people. In my Senior year I took Advanced Digital Design and Multimedia where we touched on ActionScript a little bit when we were learning about Adobe Flash. After high school I went to college and got a Bachelor of Science in Game Programming. It was mostly C# and Unity but we also had some C++ classes, a Java class, two classes where I did Python and one Lua class."

cscareerquestions,f2duzon,t3_dcnc7i,1570166114.0,"Hi! I'm presently in the interview process with several companies. I had one final interview with one company today and I have another final interview with a company I am more interested in on Tuesday. I have also had 3 secondary interviews and some initial interviews with other companies. This is only my second job search ever so I have some questions. One is if I get an offer with one of the companies I am currently interviewing with but am still interested in others can I try to get them to speed up the process? If so what should I say? Do I e-mail the recruiter I initially spoke with about it or the hiring manager if I have spoken to the hiring manager? 

My other question is if I get multiple offers or even if I don't how do I go about negotiating salary? Also how long do companies usually give you to make a decision about an offer? I am interviewing with mostly game studios. My last job I started as an intern and then when I graduated Uni they gave an exploding offer with only the weekend to make my decision. I appreciate any and all advice."
cscareerquestions,f285rr3,t1_f284q1g,1570053358.0,I did get a little money from the game. The project's team was all students and one alumnus from my Uni who has an indie studio. I had a full-time job while in college and working on this game. I eventually took a leave of absence for 6 months from my job and finished the game and then moved for an internship. I then got offered an entry-level job from the place I interned and worked there until I got laid off. I have 5 projects on my portfolio that are a mix of school projects and game jam projects. I don't think they would all fit but I can try changing the margins and fitting some of the best ones in.
cscareerquestions,f267jcn,t1_f26568u,1569996808.0,Ok.  I can bold the company names. Also for the last point it was a contract for an indie game where I got paid in royalties. I have projects from game jams and university classes but if I add projects then my resume will be over a page long. Should I add some anyways? They are on my portfolio and GitHub. Thanks for the advice btw.
