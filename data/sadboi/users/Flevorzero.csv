Anxiety,fp96gfk,t3_gbnjuv,1588416169.0,"I’m scared to go back to my work(work shitty long hours in a bakery,but alas good pay atleast)

With an annoying boss who always brags about how good he is at everything and his expensive audi where he always tells the story about how more expensive it to change any part compared to my car.

Oh yea and he always tries to find ways to keep me working longer so he can go home earlier.

Luckly i work with great colleagues who don’t like him either.

But yea i’m anxious of going back to work because i’ll have to deal with his shit again.

I don’t want to go back i feel good here being able to rest and relax in the comfort of my own home."
