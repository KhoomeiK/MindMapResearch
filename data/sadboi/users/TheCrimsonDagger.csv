After 8 years of the GOP bitching and moaning about the deficit under Obama. Only it’s actually worse under Trump because his deficit spending went to tax cuts for billionaires so they could artificially boost their own portfolios with corporate stock buybacks. Deficit spending is *supposed* to go towards things that boost long term GDP, or economic stimulus to protect people during a recession. Not further inflating the net worth of the wealthiest people in the country. Both sides waste money on stupid shit, but the GOP are worse by far with 1% tax cuts and endless wars (Obama didn’t do a good job in the war department either, one of my main criticisms of him is that while he didn’t start the wars in the ME he certainly didn’t make the situation any better) while at the same time cutting education and healthcare.

I’m not saying that this isn’t worse than 2008, that’s not the point. The point is that Trump wasted valuable time denying that there was problem and calling the pandemic a “Democrat hoax”. It’s not rocket science to understand that ignoring a problem, especially infectious disease, makes the pain exponentially worse at a later date. I’m not trying to quantify exactly how much worse this made things, but to try to act like it didn’t make things worse is just being dishonest. There are other western countries that did a bad job too, like the UK. There are also countries like South Korea or Germany that have performed well. None of that makes what we did any better though. But we can certainly look at how South Korea and Germany reacted quickly and aggressively and are faring much better. The bottom line is that we would be in this mess no matter what, but we can say for a fact that the Trump administration’s actions or lack there of has led to a worse outcome both financially and in lives lost, even if its impossible to quantify exactly how much."

They’re not dumb enough to vote for someone like Trump or Moscow Mitch, but they still have a primal fear of the word “socialism”.

We don’t have a lot of information on the full capabilities of the Spartan 4s but we do know that they only have very limited augmentations. Chief did get upgraded to Gen2 armor same as the 4s in Halo 5. So armor wise they are equal, but the augmentations Chief has are insane, not to mention his experience. If Chief wanted to he should of been able to hospitalize Locke before he even had a chance to react."
halo,fm5wjqw,t1_fm5sfue,1585781413.0,"Johnson isn’t immune to the flood, just resistant. Spartan 2s are the best of the best. But also incredibly expensive to make. The armor alone costs nearly as much as a frigate and they have personal starship class AI with them. All together making a Spartan 2 means not making multiple starships. Not to mention the time required. Also worth mentioning for the moral issues is that the Spartan II program was created to fight human insurrectionists, the Human-Covenant war conveniently started towards the end of their training. So they weren’t even created as the lesser of two evils to save humanity, they were created to suppress rebels. The Spartan 3 program was designed to be cheaper than its predecessor by cutting back on equipment and augmentations and making up for it in teamwork. While the 2s were extremely valuable asset, the cost prevented large numbers from being made. The extreme augmentations also lead to around 50% dying from them. The 3s however were still very effective alone, no match for twos though. They could however be made by the hundreds and sent on critical missions that had to be done even though they would almost certainly die. The Spartan 4s further lean into quantity over quality, teamwork, and not kidnapping and cloning children to make super soldiers. They have very limited augmentations and instead make up for it with the advancements made in MJOLNIR armor. As far as I know they don’t have their own AI like the 2 did, I don’t think the 3s did either. The 4s are little more than taking the best normal soldiers available and throwing them in MJOLNIR armor with some extra training. The armor is still very expensive so it’s not like every ODST could just be given one. There’s still only around 3-5 hundred Spartan 4s, although the program is still ongoing. This is still way more than the 33 that survived Augmentations of the original 75 is the first Spartan 2 class. If you have to fight the enemy all over the galaxy, even the strongest soldier in existence can be in two places at the same time."

It’s mostly a lack of character development for Locke that ruins him. Master Chief is also extremely confident in his own abilities, but it comes across different in my opinion. To me Chief is more “Humanity can’t afford for me to fail, so I won’t even consider the possibilities” and Locke is more “I am not actually even capable of failing”. I think this is mostly due to Halo 5’s poor writing and lack of character development. We’ve had 4 games to build up Chief’s abilities and character development. It feels like the writers wanted Locke to be at that level without having to do any of the build up. 

Also Locke tried to get my boy Thel Vadamee killed, I’ll never forgive him for that."
halo,fm54x16,t1_fm3mrna,1585766399.0,"The logic plague is method by which a grave mind can “infect” and AI by talking to them for an extended period of time. This happened to Mendicant Bias during the Forerunner-Flood war. There is strong reason to suspect that this happened to Cortana during her time with the Gravemind on High Charity when she had to be left behind. Cortana may not even be aware that she’s working for the flood.

Now human SmartAI have a “lifespan” of 7 years. After that they start to go rampant, and lose control. So normally the UNSC decommissions then at 7 years of service. This didn’t happen because Chief and Cortana were lost in space after the events of Halo 3. We saw Cortana progressively getting worse through Halo 4. Worth mentioning that Cortana is the only AI to be modeled after a human brain, Dr Halsey. So it’s possible she wasn’t actually experiencing rampancy and instead the affects of the logic plague. Anyways at the end of Halo 4 Cortana splits herself into multiple to be able to take on the Didact and save Chief. It is then assumed that she exploded with his ship. Cue Halo 5 where Cortana has showed up seemingly “cured” of her rampancy and is awakening Forerunner guardians. These guardians were created by the Forerunners to police troublesome worlds. It is suspected that Cortana May have somehow ended up at Maethrillian, the long lost Forerunner capital city. It’s not confirmed but this is a way that she could be controlling the guardians. Cortana also claims to be able to cure rampancy and calls for all of the AIs in the galaxy to join her as the “Created”. She could possibly just be spreading the logic plague to them, even unknowingly. Anyways almost all end up joining her and at this point Cortana is trying to take up the “Mantle of Responsibility”. Basically the burden of the most powerful race to protect all races in the galaxy. This idea started with the Precursors (I was accidentally calling them Primordials last night, it’s been a while oops), who tried to pass it on to humanity. This is when the forerunners betrayed them and decided it was their role. After the forerunners were wiped out they intended for humanity to rise again and take this role once they attained enough power and advancement. Humanity is not even close to that level of power yet, they would need to access ancient forerunner technology. Anyways Cortana is claiming this is the job of the “Created”. And with access to the Guardian ships and the Promethean foot soldiers she could accomplish it. So Halo 5 is, other than Locke’s ego, about trying to stop Cortana before she awakens all the Guardian ships and becomes too strong. This doesn’t go too well, and at the end of Halo 5 she is sending Guardians everywhere to demilitarize the galaxy. We also see the flag I ship of the UNSC the *Infinity* is having to repeatedly make random slipspace jumps to avoid being caught. Infinity could fight a Guardian 1v1 and stand a chance if they were prepared. But Cortana has unknown number of them, but it’s a lot. Enough to police the whole galaxy she apparently believes. In the legendary ending of Halo 5 we also get a shot of the camera approaching unknown Halo ring with Cortana menacingly humming. We have since found out that this is Installation 07 aka Zeta Halo. Possibly the most lore important Halo. It is the only remaining ring that was constructed at the greater ark instead of the lesser ark. Anyways this is where the Forerunners put the now Stone Age humans after their war with them. They even started to build societies there. Against the knowledge of the other forerunners the Master Builder Fabre, who made the rings, began to do experiments on the humans with the flood. It involved these humans “immunity” to the flood. Turns out this was just a flood strategy to fuck with the forerunners and they weren’t actually immune. Faber placed this ring and the other eleven under the control of Mendicant Bias, the lead AI on forerunner defense. Mendicant was charged with test firing the ring. The system it was fired in happened to be where the Primordial, a gravemind left behind by the Precursors, was imprisoned. The firing of the ring accidentally released it. By the order of Faber this Primordial was taken onto Zeta Halo to be interrogated by Mendicant. Unaware of the logic plague being a thing, Mendicant was eventually turned to the side of the flood. Faber was also manipulated into compliance with the Primordial by unknown means. It then took control of Zeta Halo, and ordered Faber to continue his experiments for now reason other than its own amusement. Mendicant then broke the ring’s flood containment procedure and the ring became mostly covered in flood biomass. Some other shit happens and eventually Mendicant take this ring into battle with the Forerunner capital Maethrillian and fires the ring. Lots of other shit happens, and eventually the Forerunners defeat Mendicant, take the ring, and kill the Primordial. Mendicant was forced into a long term process to “correct” his rampancy. Now remember the guy we talked to through the terminal’s in Halo 3? That is Mendicant Bias still around and kicking, seemingly healthy again. The ring was eventually sent through a slipspace portal to remain as a sacred tomb for the millions that died there. It was fired with the rest of the rings by the forerunners at the conclusion of the war. So now a ring heavily steeped in Human, Forerunner, and Flood history and bloodshed is now the focus of Cortana. Very suspicious. So Zeta Halo is looking to be the primary setting of Infinite. We may also go back to Reach, where lots of Forerunner tech and Halsey’s research including brain sample are left behind, to make an Anti-Cortana. This would be a direct parallel to Offensive Bias being created to fight infected Mendicant Bias. Somehow we’re going to have to find a way to stop Cortana, with the Flood presumably making an  surprise entrance at some point. If you want to watch videos on this stuff you should check out HiddenXperia in YouTube."
halo,fm3ljjg,t1_fm3jyfb,1585727846.0,"Once the Forerunners concluded that the Halo rings were the only option there were those in their society that set in motion plans for Humanity to rise again and take the Mantle. I’ll give you a tldr time line.

Primordials create forerunners. Primordials create humans. Primordials create tons of other life. Lots of time. Primordials choose humanity to be their successors. Forerunners big mad. Forerunners defeat the Primordials somehow. Forerunners take the Mantle. Humans and Forerunners fuck off to their own halves of the galaxy. Lots of time. Humans find some weird dust shit that turns out to be a ground up primordial that became corrupted. They feed it to their dogs (not joking). The Flood are born. Humanity starts losing planets to the flood and have to retreat while figuring out a way to beat the parasite. They accidentally retreat into Forerunner space. Forerunners assume war and proceed to fight Humanity. The two species kinda hate each other and so no communication can be established to correct the mistake. Humanity cannot fight two equal opponents at the same time, and ends up losing on both fronts. Only now do the Forerunners realize what’s been going on. They begin fighting the flood. Forerunner scientist creates the 1st generation of Halo rings. Politicians refuse to fire them. Mendicant Bias is infected with the logic plague and defects to the flood. Big damage to Forerunners. Offensive Bias is created to defeat Mendicant and succeeds. 2nd generation of smaller and more powerful Halo rings are created. A group of Forerunners secretly set it up so that Humanity is to inherit the Mantle once life returns to the galaxy via the “seeds” they planted. Forerunner government authorized the rings to be fired. Rings are fired, only life left in the galaxy is on the Halo rings. Eventually all the flood spores die out with no food. Lots of time passes. Master Chief bitches."
halo,fm3koud,t1_fm3fclx,1585726943.0,Also worth mentioning that the only reason the forerunners were able to beat the humans was because the flood weakened them significantly. They were more or less equally matched. Once the Forerunners found out that humanity wasn’t actually invading it was too late. Ironically if the Forerunners hadn’t themselves been weakened from defeating humanity they likely would of been able to destroy the flood. Combined forces the flood wouldn’t of stood a chance. The whole fucking flood apocalypse could of been avoided if the Forerunners hadn’t twice been so petty about the Primordials choosing ancient humanity as their successors over the Forerunner. A lack of communication lead to the destruction of virtually all life in the galaxy.

Universal healthcare isn’t even a question, it’s supported by everyone in the rest of the developed world. The US pays 2-3 times as much per capita for healthcare. While 80 million are uninsured or underinsured. Universal healthcare is cheaper and covers more people, because the goal is to provide healthcare, not maximize corporate profits. Universal healthcare also saves money indirectly. Since more people can go to the doctor they’re much more likely to catch issues early and prevent them. Long term is cheaper because they’re not being hospitalized by preventable disease. There is not “rationing”. You only wait on things that aren’t time sensitive. Universal healthcare doesn’t create more people that are suffering, it just doesn’t ignore them if they’re poor. You’re literally arguing that people should suffer so that you don’t have to wait as long to have non time sensitive procedures done. 

The Democratic Party would be the Conservative party in Western Europe. The Republican Party is looking more and more like the political parties that Europe fought to kick out in the 40s and would be slaughtered in elections.

Conservatives calling abortion murder is laughable. Science and facts say that a tiny clump of cells without any nervous system or function of its own is not a human. There is no sentience, no emotion, no thoughts. At that point it’s really not that different from bacteria. If I have a enough metals, tools, energy, and time to make a car, well I still don’t have a car. Even if your goal is to reduce abortions for some other reason, making it illegal doesn’t actually accomplish that. It simply increases the number of unsafe abortions being done. Providing birth control and actual sexual education beyond “Don’t have sex, it’s bad” is what reduces abortions. Conservatives support policies that actually increase the number of abortions. 

Socialism is workers having ownership of the means of production. This is not directly incompatible with free market capitalism from an ideological standpoint. The end state of capitalism will be corporatism and a single company/person controlling literally everything. Of course people would revolt or society would collapse before it got quite that far though. Without regulation a free market will become a captured market. In that sense socialism and capitalism would not be compatible.

Nationalism logically leads to intolerance, bigotry, and hate. Those are generally considered bad things. Do note that nationalism is distinctly different from patriotism. There’s a difference between “I love my country and want to see it succeed and improve” and “My country is the best in the world and can do no wrong”. 

We’ve been trying to make trickle down economics work since Reagan. Real wages have been stagnant since the 80s for the working class. Meanwhile cost of living and education have skyrocketed. Corporate profits have constantly increased and the 1% holds and ever expanding share of the wealth. Remember the trillion dollar corporate tax cut Trump gave? That was supposedly gonna be reinvested into the economy and creating jobs? Yeah they spent the overwhelming majority on stock buybacks to inflate executive and board of directors portfolios. These companies are now getting even more government money in the form of bailouts because of their own incompetency to prepare for a recession. Recessions are inevitable, there will always be another crisis that comes along. In a free market these companies would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. So much for trickle down economics.

I specifically said that some of the things are not traditionally conservative policies. But when conservative politicians, who represent their conservative voters, are overwhelming in favor of certain  then they become conservative policies. Kinda like how new words get added to languages, or grammar rules change. Now you could argue that these people aren’t actually conservative and I’d kind of agree with you. On one hand you could say that conservatism is a set historical philosophy and can’t be changed, that an evolution of conservatism would actually need it own name. Or you could argue that conservatism is more like a language and things can be added/removed from it as “conservatives” themselves change. I think the semantics is kinda pointless though because traditional conservatism doesn’t exist politically in America anymore. 

Everything I’ve said here is easily found on google. Real wages, wealth inequality, definition of socialism, progression of capitalism, political scale in the developed world, cost of healthcare by capita, quality of healthcare, etc.. None of this stuff is hard to look up."
