GetStudying,fqpsbm6,t3_gjour3,1589553055.0,"This might sound weird but try taking breaks every 20 mins. The breaks don‚Äôt have to be long, but stand up during those breaks. When you do need a longer break, take one. 

That really helps me to be conscious of my time instead of just sitting down, hoping for the best and taking a break when I‚Äôm burnt out. Taking breaks before I burn out helps me study for many hours in a day (collectively).

Another tip, when you‚Äôre done for the day try to identify EXACTLY what you‚Äôll study the next day (at least the first few things). That way you don‚Äôt waste any energy planning the next day.

Keep a list of fun/useful things you can do during your breaks. I like to fill my fun list with small chores, certain treats to eat, an episode of something, 10 min walk etc"

My personal advice is to do your best to keep modifying your lifestyle until you find the right balance that gives you the energy/endurance you need to focus.

Accents,fl97jrw,t3_fgztfc,1584943804.0,"I‚Äôm canadian and while I understand there‚Äôs lots of variations within US English, I do notice some key differences between our English and yours 

Americans seem to say some vowels differently, like really drawn out or ‚Äútwangy‚Äù if you will. For example, in ‚Äú-an‚Äù sounds Americans say it like ‚Äúayynnn‚Äù like there‚Äôs an invisible y. Actually I do see this in Canadians but I notice it more in American English

I notice some vowels are super drawn out like ‚Äúabout.‚Äù I always think, why do they need to open their mouth so wide! Also, Americans get lazy with many constants, like the T in internet sounds like ‚Äúinnernet‚Äù 

In general I just notice the pronunciation of vowels is noticeable. Another example is college, to my ears it sounds like americans say ‚ÄúKAAAAllege‚Äù whereas Canadians would pronounce college the same way as the verb ‚Äúto call‚Äù 

I assume you were mainly asking about pronunciation but I actually have more ideas about word choice if you‚Äôre interested haha"

I don‚Äôt blame Natsumi for having a problem with Minori either but I kind of thought twice about that when I saw Natsumi act similarly with Misaki

Overall it just seemed like she was never fond of either of those girls, and resorted to passive aggressiveness to poke at them. It‚Äôs just that Misaki was more comfortable with speaking up whereas Minori was suuuper passive"

I just didn‚Äôt like that she never knew when it was necessary/appropriate to make a big deal of stuff. Also felt like the stuff she made a big deal of was so small, so she always stashed them away and dished them out in arguments 

Her arguments would sound so pathetic if she actually addressed her issues one by one but seems like she dumps them on others all at once to make it seem legit"
terracehouse,fl5rfv3,t3_fmqiw9,1584843804.0,"TLDR: Natsumi expected unconditional respect from others yet her respect for others was very conditional 

She was always looking for a reason to argue.. 
she could be nice and fun too, but no one could joke around her even tho she roasted n joked about everyone else. I don‚Äôt like her cuz she always plays by her own rules but demands unconditional respect. 

When other members (mainly misaki) did something that pissed off Natsumi, the other members owned up to it in a genuine way. They never talked back. 

Also, it‚Äôs really immature that she always had to drag her problems out. She kept track of petty problems and blew up about them later instead. It‚Äôs like she always wants a reason to be mad. When other people had issues with house members, they usually addressed it within 24 hours and moved on. 

Her immaturity was really apparent when other members (Hansan around her age) and Riko (way younger) told her she crossed the line about various things. She only listened to them cuz they didn‚Äôt piss her off. I doubt she would ever listen to Misaki like that cuz her respect is so conditional"
