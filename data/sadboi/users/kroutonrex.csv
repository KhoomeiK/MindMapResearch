PlanetZoo,fpt5nmq,t3_gfe4cs,1588885285.0,"Absolutely set all of your staff to their minimum wage (225 for vendors and caretakers, 1050 for keepers, gets, etc)

Also only keep a small portion of the zoo running and expand as you go. You can “close” any facilities in the Zoo management tabs or by clicking on the facility itself. When you close facilities, they won’t cost any money to run. Make sure to close staff facilities too, not just guest ones. 

And try to hike up entry fees and food/souvenir prices as much as you can. If you add “ice” to your products in any of your drink shops (it’s in a condiment drop down menu underneath the product and it’s price) you’ll get an extra $0.10 per transaction. This is the only condiment that actually increases profit as far as I’m aware.

Within your esophagus is the Vagus nerve, which either triggers you to sneeze or it triggers you to throw up. Irritation to it (from coughing, sickness, dehydration, acid reflux) can cause you to just feel nauseous without eating anything bad. Smoking of course irritates it.

She’s essentially his right hand, and, discarding his untrustworthy nature, would know all of his plans. She’s also shown to have enough authority to command the evacuation procedures of all Atlas academy, as well as command all of Mantle to obey the curfew. She’s the perfect candidate AS LONG AS she doesn’t become the maiden. 

I’ve had a feeling since she told Weiss about her duty as the Maiden, that her “perfect” future would crumble around her (as most people’s idealized futures do) and her character would become something of a foil to Cinder. They both believe being a Maiden is the key to success, they both believe in “destiny” and hold that destiny with pride. However, unlike Cinder, Winter can probably handle the disappointment if she doesn’t get the Maiden powers. And, in a greater contrast to Cinder, Winter is smart enough and strong enough to move past the failure and come up with a new plan. Preferably one that doesn’t end with her self-sacrifice. 

It’s just something about how they’ve portrayed her to be so organized and dutiful. Her perfectionist nature leads me to believe her character will grow emotionally instead of just dying like everyone suspects."

trees,f356jc8,t3_dfq5mp,1570669663.0,"Heyo, previous anorexic and current IBS patient here.

Let me preface this by saying NOTHING makes me hungry BUT cannabis. Pills and home remedies are completely useless to stimulate my appetite.

But, it’s not realistic or safe for me to wait to eat until my next hit SO here’s how to eat without actually being hungry:

1. Protein shakes, smoothies, tomato soup, beef broth, etc are NECESSARY.
- you’re going to need to put something in your stomach, wether you want to chew or not. When I’m in a mood, the thought of even small bits of potato or carrots can make me dry-heave, so nutrient-rich liquids are always on hand. Even just orange juice will help (but if you have Acid reflux too, stick to something less acidic, like milk!(unless you’re lactose intolerant too...))

2. You’re going to get nauseous. You’re probably going to throw up, too, be prepared.
-Nausea is a part of life, but it doesn’t always mean you NEED to throw up. Anti-emetics are meds that you can find bit above and below the counter: Emetrol is a liquid one that uses sugar to coat the stomach, Tums uses foam to settle acid-related discomfort, and Omeprazol is a minor psychoactive that stops your brain from making you nauseous. Choose one that best relieves the source of your nausea, wether it be physical or anxiety-based.
-you WILL vomit. Sorry, but it’s not the end of the world! Keep some toothpaste, a toothbrush, and some non-flavored gum on hand, and, if you’re able, a change of clothes! You NEED to brush your teeth after you vomit, or else you’ll destroy your teeth overtime with stomach acid. Plus, the taste of vomit just makes you want to throw up more, right? The non-flavored gum helps distract, but it also stimulates saliva production which will help soothe the inside of your mouth and throat.

3. Eat at the same time everyday.
-even if you’re just shoving a cracker or piece of chocolate in your mouth, try and schedule your feeding times. The brain thrives on pattern and routine; you’ve heard of Pavlov’s dog right? Even if you’re not hungry at these feeding times, your body will still be accustomed to digesting at the same time everyday (it learns SUPER quickly) and it will help lesson the pain of digestion and maybe even solidify your Hershey Squirts. 

I hope the rest of you break is as liquid smooth as your dumps. Please eat something, or you’ll only ruin your stomach more like I did 😬"

My solution was to instead make a supporting character EXACTLY like me.

It’s been very helpful, as I have to purposefully reign in this character’s motives and actions. 

It’s also been helpful in a humbling, introspective way. This character doesn’t have to save the world, so what are your flaws that would stop them from doing so? Are they scared or selfish? Do they have what it takes from your own personality to be a hero- and that brings the question, could you really ever be a hero?
