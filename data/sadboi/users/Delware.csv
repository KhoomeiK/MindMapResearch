benzodiazepines,fqcqqul,t1_fqcq0k8,1589265870.0,According to Wikipedia it's schedule 1 in Virginia and Louisiana but doesn't look like it's scheduled anywhere else. Would stay away from it if you're in those two states but you're probably fine anywhere else. Although be careful with clam regardless lol
benzodiazepines,fqcc03k,t3_gi1x6e,1589254578.0,I miss diclaz :(
listentothis,fpxa6o2,t3_gg3mr4,1588978654.0,I love this band! I've posted their stuff on here before
Anxiety,fpmxtal,t3_gdwcei,1588744531.0,"Omg yea I've always had this and it has manifested through different ways my whole life. When I was in elementary school a lot of assemblies they had in the gym were too loud and made me have a full on breakdown and I had to be walked out and sat in the hall. Now sometimes if I'm listening to music with really like saturated ""crunchy"" high frequencies it makes me like cringe and my brain hurts if that makes any sense."
benzodiazepines,foswt2h,t3_g9a92a,1588039688.0,Sounds lovely!! 💜💜
benzodiazepines,fokh626,t3_g7zapj,1587841987.0,Yea in a recreational setting I get everything that I would want out of drinking and more but with no negative physical side effects.
benzodiazepines,foc79c5,t1_foc595a,1587667927.0,"Sounds good! No problem, enjoy it 😊"
benzodiazepines,foc4l7l,t1_foc33r5,1587667035.0,"It honestly doesn't really matter how you ingest it. If you want it to hit as fast as possible, drop it under your tongue and let it sit there for a minute. It will absord sublingually and probably hit you really fast. Or you can drop it on a gummy bear or mix it in with a drink, really up to you!"
benzodiazepines,foc14hz,t3_g6ro04,1587665950.0,Figure out its concentration (mg/ml) and probably start off with 1-2mg if you have a low tolerance. Diclazepam has a similar dosage profile to ativan. It's one of my favourite benzos ever for therapeutic reasons.
benzodiazepines,fo5rse2,t3_g5uo83,1587533679.0,Lmao I love it
benzodiazepines,fnuztu2,t3_g3v5zc,1587275743.0,Nah this is super cool!! I find benzos actually really help creatively for me as well. They kind of open the floodgates without worry and you can really just get in your flow
benzodiazepines,fni87ws,t1_fni84dw,1586975634.0,Yeah which I think is a pretty popular mindset for people on benzos
benzodiazepines,fni4nqy,t1_fni47bx,1586973912.0,They can if you're used to being in a state of intense anxiety. Once that is lifted the feeling of relief can be quite euphoric.
benzodiazepines,fnfny3i,t1_fn1p1fs,1586911858.0,Etizolam seems to have pretty easy WD's for some of ppl actually. You're not the first person I've heard say this kind of thing. For others tho it's just as bad as any other regular benzo.

benzodiazepines,fn1m8w0,t1_fmziozc,1586565033.0,Yeah I feel this 100%. I have a freind who on average takes about 2-4mg of etiz a day and he claims that he barely even gets WD's if he stops. Just feels kind of 'off' and tired. Not the case for me but I get how it would affect people like that. It's such an interesting drug tbh! Always finding out new things about it. Sadly though it's the only 'benzo' I have access to at the moment. Really missing diclaz.
benzodiazepines,fmgdp84,t1_fmg3hg4,1586046726.0,Omg pls stay safe hope you can find something to avoid withdrawals. Being cut off from doses that high could be really dangerous
listentothis,fm77my4,t1_fm71iv2,1585816220.0,Hm I would argue that post-demarco is a pretty specific combination of sonic elements that this song has none of. This song is definitely more on the rock side of things and I don't think it's fair to lump her into that scene. If you're trying to make the copy cat argument I think this is pretty undeserving of that claim as far as indie music goes.
indieheads,fm50ik6,t3_ft18p0,1585764060.0,This is so good!!
listentothis,fm4wjp4,t3_ft419q,1585762101.0,Woah cool! Just posted fanclubwallet's talking heads cover here a few days ago.

benzodiazepines,fkuk2pa,t1_fkuij92,1584550863.0,Yeah antidepressants only made my life worse in the long run honestly. I'm off them now luckily and trying to manage my benzo addiction. I've tried to quit three times now and have started back everytime so I know how hard it is. I don't take high doses anymore though.
benzodiazepines,fkuhu23,t1_fkuhoi1,1584549695.0,"I know man it's basically having to relearn how to live life. Shit is not easy, you need to find other coping mechanisms that work for you to replace benzos basically."
benzodiazepines,fkuh4ef,t3_fks6br,1584549322.0,Takes a long time but if you're truly committed it will eventually go away
benzodiazepines,fkrcmlz,t1_fkr81c0,1584466199.0,Lmao yea like these are all the ppl that must be privileged enough to not have to deal with the horrible policies initiated by repubs and corporate dems. Hundreds of thousands of people are in jail for smoking a joint and these ones are in here wanting more tough on crime bullshit? So ridiculous

benzodiazepines,fk3blyi,t3_fg3j13,1583825603.0,"Etizolam is my favourite benzo! It's hella euphoric and really functional (makes me wanna get work done in the 2-4mg range). Only thing is that if you're using it for anxiolysis I find for me it doesn't completely get rid of my anxiety like alprazolam or diazepam does. There's always a little bit lingering, I feel like that's the trade off for me anyways. Have fun!"

doordash_drivers,fi6bov8,t3_f6pudm,1582187010.0,"Thank goodness, thought I got deactivated lol."
TurnoverVA,fi0zhsb,t3_f5gjag,1582047736.0,"This is probably wrong and how I'm personally interpreting the song but I always thought that line referred to just letting go of the desire to change your state of mind and letting your sober mind be. Also because of ""I could just take a little bit less."" But I have a feeling that Aus is speaking more generally in the chorus than that honestly. Just always how I interpreted it :)

Edit: forgot why I thought this. The first line ""sitting up there so high you'll never get to look at something like you would from the bottom, it's lonely staring down at everyone. Where am I gonna go when there's nowhere left to climb?"" Heavily insinuates to me that the lyrics are questioning always being in an altered state of mind."

TurnoverVA,f9ndfnd,t1_f9nd471,1575482231.0,"Agreed! By saying he had a hand in it I didn't mean he was a little bit involved. What I meant was I think there was a lot of formulaic writing going between him and Austin that we lost with altogether (ie: harmonizing guitar parts that bounce off each other). This was kind of essential to their sound for PV and GN. And yeah the fact that they put cutting my fingers off back is extremely telling, really good point."
TurnoverVA,f9l9ybp,t3_e5mjjc,1575417967.0,"It's so hard to tell with this band. I think they're going to see the numbers and realize that peripheral vision is what really stuck with people and that they're going to need to create that kind of magic again in order to really move the wave to their newest material. Whether or not they'll be able to do it I'm not sure but I really hope Austin has it in him. Eric's departure was necessary but I worry his contribution was essential to creating that magic as he had a hand in Good Nature and you can also hear PV magic in that record for sure. I don't think altogether ever gets to the euphoria levels that PV and GN get to even though it's still a wonderful album. What altogether has that the others don't is instrumental expansion. We're finally hearing synths, strings, sax. My hope is that their next album will be a more organized and sonically potent version of everything before it. But this band always throws curve balls so there's really no telling. I'm just high and really invested in this band lol."

TurnoverVA,ezw5iqj,t3_d2fyr7,1568208463.0,Yes but unfortunately that's the scene they got lumped into and even though their style drastically changed they never really got out.
