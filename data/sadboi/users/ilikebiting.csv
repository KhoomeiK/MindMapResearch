Self harm really is much easier for me. Been cutting for 11ish years now. Cut last night. Helped me fall asleep."

depression,fovwi0h,t1_fovvto2,1588108744.0,"Ah I wish I could walk in the woods alone. Living alone in a city centre so there aren't many places to walk where its not too crowded unfortunately. Can only go for quick walks. 

I am working from home so mainly I do that. If not then I usually just lay in bed or browse the internet. Nothing special."
depression,fovve8v,t3_g9ujo0,1588108188.0,"Really bad, especially lately during this lockdown. Can't even read a book or watch a show to distract myself."
EDAnonymous,fn9r9ym,t3_g0gf4l,1586782530.0,i also need to research menus before i can order and i feel so anxious when restaurant plans are made suddenly.
EDAnonymous,fn9ouyr,t3_g0glfd,1586780569.0,"Sorry you're finding all of this hard :( I'm finding the lockdown really hard too. Yesterday I purged for the first time in 3 months and I feel really bad about it. I find it easier not to restrict or binge and purge when I am around people and keeping busy at work. But being at home alone all day means I just slip back into my ED habits. 

Eat the noodles - you deserve it."
EDAnonymous,fn8hw7l,t3_g066mj,1586742021.0,Feel absolutely disgusting and guilty and terrible about it but... I've also thought this.
