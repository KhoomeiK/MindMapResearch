StarWars,ffcgisq,t1_ffcg57m,1579798969.0,"It's very different to have an opinion on something, than to state something as a fact. And yeah, obviously, if you're not a professional, you shouldn't criticize what professionals are doing as if you were one of those professionals too. I'm not saying you're not allowed to have an opinion, but giving your opinion and stating it with such conviction, AND making it sound like you know what you're talking about, when you're not one of those professionals, is pretty bad. As someone who works in the industry, if someone with a not-creative position tells me what I'm doing as a professional creative is wrong, I can laugh in their face, because there's always a reason I'm doing what I'm doing, at the end of the day, that's why I was hired for the job, and not them."

suggestmeabook,ff98mv8,t3_eschdb,1579707378.0,"I think the best way to go with this is to find something that they‚Äôll truly enjoy and look forward to pick up again. There are some awesome YA books out there (I still read YA , even as a grown up). Ned Vizzini has awesome books, he was a very clever and fun writer, and although he wrote about mental health, his books are funny and have a positive outlook. I‚Äôd recommend Be More Chill, which is also now a Broadway Musical, and has a movie in the making. He also co-wrote some fiction books, I haven‚Äôt read them yet though, but I think they‚Äôre called The House of Secrets. 

There‚Äôs thousands of options, I think another good way to start is by getting a novelization of a movie they really like (Star Wars, for example. They have tons of books that extend the stories of the movies, get in-depth about specific characters, and a lot of their books aren‚Äôt long). I understand you may want something that has a more advanced vocabulary, and if that‚Äôs the case I think it‚Äôs better to start with something simple and easy to digest, so they don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed, or like reading is a difficult task. 

Horror books can be very good too, good ones can make you not want to put the book down! So maybe you can consider that option as well :) 

You can also introduce them to GoodReads, they have virtual book clubs, and they can share reviews, and connect with other people and discover new books! Super fun site.

Hope this helps. Good luck!"
