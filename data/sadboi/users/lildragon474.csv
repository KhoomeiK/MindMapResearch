genderqueer,fpkq91k,t3_gdwazs,1588699150.0,"I battled a long time with gender. AFAB, and had plenty of dysphoria for quite a while. Around age 6-forever, I enjoyed breaking the stereotypes for female; around age 14 I was being most commonly misgendered as male in public (short hair, baggy clothes) and I got a bit of a thrill from that, not necessarily because I didn't want to be considered female, but because it was a triumph in that I was not stereotypically female. It was probably around age 20 that I started to feel comfortable in my skin enough to understand this dysphoria was not that I was male, but that I wasn't quite female 100% either. In this entire story I was always comfortable being gendered as male, female or anywhere in between. I settled on gender queer, because I don't feel different  day to day, and I like playing with gender norms more than I care about what pronoun is used. I feel that if there were no gender expectations, I would never have had issues being female, but I hated to be put into that box.

As the other person said, gender being a spectrum means it's okay to fall somewhere in the middle, and depending on how close you are to the middle, or the other side, will dictate how much you may want to change. There's something liberating about telling your truths to people who will love and accept you, so I'm all for telling people if you want to. You may be surprised at how many people feel some degree of similar - I was shocked to find that my mom did. But as I'm fiercely private and I don't actually care how I'm gendered, I just live the life I would regardless and let the chips fall where they may."

In the lifecycle of the tapeworm, whichever creature ingests the eggs (and tapeworm egg packets are amongst the most disgusting adaptation of a parasite), if they are a potential intermediate host, gets immature tapeworms in cysts in their liver and muscle. Good news, humans are not an intermediate or accidental host for the most common cat tapeworm. 

You get tapeworm from two sources. Most commonly, undercooked pork. Less commonly, ingesting the prey item that hosts the tapeworm - for one of the cat and dog tapeworms, that would mean inadvertently eating a flea. 

You can get roundworm from your cat (or dog), so practice good hand hygiene and clean up poops promptly before the worm larvae has the chance to mature to an infective stage. You can also get roundworm from raccoon poop, and those worms have the tendency to migrate terrible places, like your eye."

I'm glad you have Andrew. It sounds like he's lucky to have you too. Can you make a part of your mental health care to do something positive for him? One of the projects I'm working on is improving something in my snakes' enclosure every week. Could you do something similar for Andrew? If it makes him happy that might help. It's okay to need the positive external influence while you work on yourself. And your friends are right, it's ok to be not ok - but I'm sorry they are violating your confidence. Do you have access to a therapist who you would be able to talk to?"
SuicideWatch,fkg9xut,t3_fiaxsv,1584153731.0,It's actually the biggest reason I will never own a gun. I don't trust myself with one in my house. I hope that you can get to a point where you no longer want one.
SuicideWatch,fkg9r8r,t3_fib0c8,1584153593.0,"That's honestly such a good point. Doesn't matter if we know the votes don't mean anything, on a platform where upvotes rule most subreddits, having them on a subreddit full of emotionally vulnerable people just seems silly. I know it doesn't matter if my comment has 5 or 6 upvotes, but when reddit tells me it hit x number of upvotes, I'm going to notice if it went down."
SuicideWatch,fkg8wkz,t3_fi7iws,1584152947.0,"One of the most important things I learned in life is that how other people act is not your responsibility. They and they alone are responsible for their decisions and their actions. Please never feel like you being around is making other people feel or behave a certain way, that is not your fault."
SuicideWatch,fkg86ls,t1_fkg7qce,1584152405.0,"Survival instinct is an amazing thing, it's powerful enough to make a person cut a limb off to save their life, but allows for someone to sacrifice themselves to save a child, or another person. Maybe it's a force we shouldn't argue with when it's telling us something?"
SuicideWatch,fkg7ylw,t3_fi8och,1584152241.0,"I see in your earlier post that you're stuck abroad, I was just wondering if you would have any luck with an embassy? Or heck, hitchhike to somewhere different just to do it. You mention people who would understand, can you talk to any of them?"
SuicideWatch,fkg7m38,t3_fi8p07,1584151980.0,Sorry you're in this situation. I commend you for the effort you're putting in. Are there any local resources that can help with debt?
SuicideWatch,fkg7e35,t3_fi8ugq,1584151814.0,"I think, sometimes we put a lot of stock into the way things are supposed to go. We follow the steps that people lay before us because that's what we're supposed to do. I think it's probably at least part of why you're waiting by that bannister, because you made your plan and you have decided that's what you should do. But you write in your post that you don't want to die, and you want to spend time with your girlfriend. I implore you to listen to what you've written. Does anyone in your life know how you're feeling? Also Friday the 13th is a sweet day to have a birthday."
SuicideWatch,fkg6uqo,t3_fi94ad,1584151417.0,"It's an awful feeling, and it sucks. I wish I could give you an exact timeline but heartbreak is one of those things where it's okay to recover ar your own pace. Do you have anyone you can talk about these things with?"
SuicideWatch,fkg6lsg,t3_fi9963,1584151233.0,"I'm sorry that you're feeling at the end of your rope. I'm not here to encourage you to take your pills, but to let you know you've got people here wanting you to be okay, and wanting to help"
