It's a console and a handheld in one so you can use it much more than the PS4 pro which retails at $400 or the One X which goes for $500 (at full price, often on sale though).

On top of that while the graphic quality doesn't quite compare to those other consoles you have access to a truly unique library with a lot of the games that are made for switch.

>The vast majority of Xbox users probably use them (although I lack proof on that).

So why even make the argument without proof??

I work at best buy and sell both Xboxes and batteries. I can guarantee you people only buy single use batteries in bulk for their random small electronics that are often don't require constant changing (tv remotes, smoke alarms, maybe some extras to have for the kids toys around the holidays). Almost everyone who says they need batteries for gaming will get the rechargeable set that includes a charger for $20 or they'll get one of the branded rechargeable battery packs/controller stands specifically for the Xbox. 

You say you were using rechargeable batteries in 99 on your Gameboy. Can I ask how old you were then? Do you seriously think the average Xbox gamer who is buying their own console/accessories (so likely 20+ years old) is unable to consider the options when it comes to buying? 

Because of their decision you have 4 options for your controller:

1. Single use batteries, who knows how much $ down the drain over 5-6 years of a console lifespan.

2. Rechargeable batteries, get a four pack specifically for gaming and you should always have a pair on the charger ready to swap.

3. Rechargeable battery pack. Had a best buy brand pack before I got my elite and it would last my entire 7-8  hour gaming sessions and I could just put it on the charger over night. 

4. If you're using any of those options and they happen to fail (out of batteries, someone borrowed your second set, or you forgot to charge over night) then you can plug in with a cable if absolutely necessary."

That date/title has no significance to anyone who didn't watch the stream. He could've promoted it but didn't. Not RCA's doing, I'm almost positive that was completely Donald's choice.

So he had 2 festivals and 1 wasn't exactly like the other? I went to both and believe me I was expecting a full new album, but it just wasn't ready. He had an injury and family death literally right before this event. If he isn't ready to perform an album that is still a WiP then he shouldn't. 

>Teased Guava Island and made it seem like it'd connect to his album.

 Don't know where you pulled this from. He showed a trailer off at Pharos New Zealand. That was it until he announced it was premiering at Coachella. Besides the tag ""A Childish Gambino Film"" there was no indication that movie had anything to do with an upcoming album, especially when the vibe was completely different from songs like Algorythm. I always took it to just be a project he wanted to work on. He got to dance and sing with Rihanna. Regardless of if it was for an album I'm certain it was a special project to him. 


>Had a Grammy commercial with an unreleased song (Human Sacrifice)

Promotes a collab (Google x Gambino) with new music. Literally nothing crazy about that. Later at a concert he explains why this song might not ever see full release. Disappointing but he was honest with us.

>Teases an album drop at Coachella

Don't remember this at all and was all over those Coachella streams. He did drop some shoes though.

>Song leaks indicating new album might be coming ""Nightlife""

Since when do instrumental loosies that leak indicate a brand new project is coming? Don't believe leaks especially from an artist who rarely has leaks.

>Saturday, Atavista, Human Sacrifice, All Night, Nightlife, and Die With You

Saturday and Die with you were tracks made for Guava Island. Atavista unfortunately is just a cut intro. With We Are being the intro to the album wouldn't make sense for another one before Algorythm. Human Sacrifice and All Night didn't make the cut according to Donald. He didn't like where the songs were going. Nightlife again was a leak. Donald probably didn't want anyone to hear that.

>Then he drops an album out of nowhere with no cover or album art. And the album we get doesn't have half of the songs he's been teasing for 2 years.

>but things are different when you promise fans one thing and get their hopes up, only to completely not deliver on what they had been waiting years for.

Maybe let the dust settle on this one before you judge him. My personal opinion is that Gambino isn't done yet. It's not like him to drop something and have nothing to say about it. Maybe this is just an appetizer for his fans who've been patiently waiting? Remember the title of this album is the day he originally released the album online, with most of his fans listening since then, with it coming to streaming a week later. 

Like you said this release seems a little scattered compared to his ones in the past. I'll be one of the first to say don't use Donald's past to try and predict his future, but I agree with you and it's because of that I don't feel like it's over yet."

xboxone,fkxulll,t1_fkxo2bs,1584635737.0,Major Nelson has literally made a joke post about how their New Zealand base seems to magically grow around every major release. They're aware of it and are not concerned at all. You've legitimately purchased the game and are just trying to play a little earlier. Doesn't really affect them at all
xboxone,fkxucb8,t1_fkxf4fe,1584635595.0,Nope. Purchase it from your store and let it download. Then just change your location in the settings and enjoy the game

LegendsOfTomorrow,fkw1boi,t1_fkvu3yw,1584581221.0,Heard rumors of an elseworlds superman show where they explore different versions of the Man of Steel. If that's true I'd would be mind blown if these two weren't cast in some version of that.

xboxone,fkqwnb0,t1_fkq3yah,1584457146.0,"Which part is a terrible decision and how exactly are they putting their employees health at risk?. The implementation of work from home policies that are designed to keep them away from large gatherings? Or the apparent ""rush job"" you think they're doing because they communicated that they still intend to hit their Target Date, which I might add is already an extra 5 months from their original release date. 

They are in the endgame now of checking/testing for bugs and adding in side quests/street stories to beef up the game. Nor is this a guarantee that they'll do whatever they can to hit that goal. 

They say they'll continue to monitor the virus situation as well as assess how the team does with the new circumstances. They left it pretty open to interpretation that ""If the release date rolls closer and we notice that were behind then we'll delay."
donaldglover,fkoqjtn,t3_fjs9m0,1584392918.0,I'll pm you

xboxone,fjigccw,t1_fjifegj,1583367012.0,"I'm sure he knows that. He's just saying they never updated it to be Xbox One X Enhanced, which is just a software update"
xboxone,fjhkdxx,t1_fjhk3yf,1583349821.0,Same here. Still gaming in 1080p (for now) but this will be my first day one console (purchased with my own money).  But I felt the jump from One to X and I want that again.
xboxone,fjhjssq,t1_fjhjb87,1583349496.0,eBay or facebook marketplace/local people. Remember the One X will be supported for at least 2 more years. Take advantage of that as a selling point and try to sell to someone as an upgrade from their day one console possibly. Not everyone buys the new consoles day one but if they can upgrade from their dying One to an X  they might go for it
RedDeadOnline,fjhi5ch,t1_fjbf1e9,1583348573.0,Bro you've still got 6 days and you can literally knock out 8 levels in 3-4 hours of gameplay easily. Run any of your role missions non stop. Each level only requires 1500xp. This pass gives you John and Arthur's outfits and I doubt you'll be able to get them again after this.
xboxone,fjh15o3,t1_fjgy02d,1583339315.0,I wish EA hadn't released it a week after battlefield and a week before call of duty effectively killing it's sales. That might be the worst release date I've ever seen

xboxone,fj5bl51,t1_fj59k36,1583028818.0,"I'm almost certain they'll have a decent deal for it. When you consider the fact that these consoles will still be forwards compatible to an extent, GameStop could make some decent money selling them pre-owned to people who don't want to upgrade to the series x. That coupled with some of their stores closing at the start of this year might make their next fiscal year look better in the long term."
