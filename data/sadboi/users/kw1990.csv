edmproduction,fqzomgk,t3_glj2uy,1589771847.0,Excellent. Their warm tape saturation is always my go to coupled with its oversampling. Throw a nice subtle micro pitch shift chorus plugin under it and you’ll be amazed by the texture it brings to your tracks

TameImpala,fqw878d,t3_gl9md8,1589695664.0,Usually comes from heavily extremely distorted sine waves I think.

edmproduction,fmnlz01,t3_fwbsbi,1586229192.0,"I didn’t really have much experience with music in a terms of theory and knowledge but grew up with a Panasonic keyboard that had all sorts of crazy sounds and synths since I was 8 when I asked my mom for one at a store for Christmas. It just naturally called to me and I remember it vividly. Which is strange because 10-20 years later (I’m 28), I’m basically doing the same thing making stupid and crazy sounds with a keyboard and expressing myself. With that being said, I started DJing at 16, when you learn DJing edm you learn structure of edm tracks and the energy of it. I then picked up fl studio at 18 years old and just went with it with hard style samples and stock plugins. I eventually hit a brick wall because I didn’t know how to mix eq etc so I learned that on my own on YouTube etc. 

Given that my father was a multi instrumentalist and a singer and my older brother is a rapper, I too had an innate instinct for music so it wasn’t like I was completely shit at it at first. In fact my first ever song I dropped on nye 2009 during my hard style set. People actually moved to it. It was Hilarious because I look back now and hear how terribly mixed it was but it still had that energy and pacing of an edm track. 

Maybe learn music theory with piano first?
Or DJing. Learn to count bars etc and study structure of edm. 
Once you understand it to some basic degree, try opening a daw and grab some sample packs to use for awhile just to get the idea making down then learn synthesis etc. 

Learn learn learn. Listen listen listen. Play play play. It’ll come to you, I promise"
