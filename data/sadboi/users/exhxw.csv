antidepressants,fi57ocs,t3_f6j95u,1582156771.0,I take 10mg and this happened to me for about a month. it got better the longer I took it. I've been taking it for about 3 months now.

Anxiety,fct0193,t3_eikh73,1577929379.0,welp I'm having a bit of a crisis now üòÖ
Anxiety,fcsk6pf,t1_fcqh5r0,1577918211.0,I had that done! i was freaking out but once i realized i wasn't allergic to the dye i felt much better. it did make me feel warm and like I had to pee a bit but that was all normal.
HealthAnxiety,fcsk3eb,t1_fcqqx0o,1577918155.0,"oh I gotcha. I had an allergy test about 10 or so years ago, I don't remember them doing blood work but I don't know if they do now or not."
HealthAnxiety,fcsjxif,t1_fcsfwgs,1577918059.0,yes I'm also afraid of the risks! especially when it comes to when they have to put meds or anything in me via an IV (I'm super afraid of the HIDA scan for this reason.) I'm sorry your family put a lot of fear in you! I understand so much how you feel.
HealthAnxiety,fcs70up,t1_fcpnuvt,1577912331.0,"oh my that sounds scary. i can understand your fear there, I'm glad you made it through though!"
HealthAnxiety,fcs6v8l,t1_fcppegg,1577912265.0,it truly is.
HealthAnxiety,fcs6t8l,t1_fcpwux5,1577912242.0,you can get a sugar meter and check it yourself at home! you can control how deep the needle goes and it's not so bad at all! but I understand your fear. I have to get someone else to actually poke me because I can't do it myself.
HealthAnxiety,fcs65sa,t1_fcqzj1e,1577911981.0,I'm so sorry that happened! why wouldn't they operate if you were panicking? I had a colonoscopy/endoscopy Monday and I had a very high heart rate and blood pressure because I was extremely nervous (not panicking yet) and they went ahead and did it. I always get that fear about not waking up from the anesthesia.
HealthAnxiety,fcs4v13,t1_fcr57na,1577911490.0,oh yes for me the waiting is the worst part 90% of the time. like the wait time between when you are told you need testing and then when you actually get it. gives me so much time to be anxious. but I agree about getting checked out and getting it over with as soon as possible.
Anxiety,fcryvdl,t3_eihiwy,1577908592.0,so happy for you!
Anxiety,fcpkpu0,t1_fcpg8vz,1577866467.0,I should feel lucky but it's very hard when I'm terrified! I'll try to keep it in mind when I have my HIDA scan though.
HealthAnxiety,fcpkmc8,t1_fcpevyw,1577866407.0,"I'm 19 too! you're very welcome. I highly doubt you will have cancer, I don't know if you research your symptoms or anything but if so, try not to! so many things have basically the exact same symptoms so there's no way we can know and it just makes the anxiety worse!"
HealthAnxiety,fcpk9hs,t1_fcpgi3r,1577866200.0,do they test for other things? totally understand your fear though
HealthAnxiety,fcpk800,t1_fcpgt6j,1577866177.0,yes the days waiting are sometimes worse than the actual tests. I'm glad everything turned out okay for you! so far it has for me too!
HealthAnxiety,fcpk4li,t1_fcphmmi,1577866128.0,have they always been that way? one of my tonsils is bigger than the other and always has been. I saw 2 ENTs and one wanted mine removed because I was getting a lot of infections but the other dr did not. I understand your fear. I was too afraid to go through with my surgery.
HealthAnxiety,fcpjyln,t1_fcphnev,1577866033.0,"that's exactly what freaks me out, the fact that I can't control what's going on. I hope everything turns out alright for you though! I also love that it helped you realize you're a lot stronger than you thought."
HealthAnxiety,fcpjstu,t1_fcpjqbu,1577865936.0,it's so terrible when that happens!
HealthAnxiety,fcpe4nk,t1_fcpdhvb,1577860094.0,I'm hoping for the best for you! they said I wouldn't get my results for a while but they actually came the same day I got my ultrasound. hopefully yours won't take more than 3 days! best of luck to you!
HealthAnxiety,fcpddua,t1_fcpd9mc,1577859242.0,do you have the results of your ultrasound? I'm hoping you're all good! but yes the testing is so stressful. especially if it's a long time between your drs appointment and your test. like for my HIDA scan it's been almost a month since I knew I had to have it and that's given me so much time to be anxious! üò©
