unpopularopinion,fqz2en5,t3_gknhqx,1589758692.0,"Boy Scouts is a dying organisation that needed to revitalise itself as well, this isn’t just some gender equality bullshit.

It started dying due to urbanisation, failure to adapt, changing demographics, and so on, but two main things hurt the Boy Scouts badly:

- Homophobia. The Boy Scouts had to be dragged kicking and screaming into modern times. For years, they hated and despised homosexuality; until just seven years ago, their policies strictly forbade homosexual members. This archaic bigotry is as old-fashioned and embarrassing as if they, say, forbade entry to Black or Jewish people.

- Widespread sex abuse. For an organization that was all about morals, morals, morals, God, God, morals, God, morals, upstanding, God, morals, morals, the Boy Scouts had a difficult time coming to grips with widespread pederasty and sex abuse in its ranks. They just filed for bankruptcy under the weight of liability for rampant sex abuse: Boy Scouts of America files for bankruptcy due to sex abuse lawsuits. And their bankruptcy filing contains a ticking bomb: notice that they intend to try to escape liability for any abuse that is not reported within about 11 weeks: Boy Scouts says it's safe, and offers sex abuse victims just 80 days to file claim. Victims balk. (How’s that for morals, eh?)

In a lot of ways, the Boy Scouts is a fossil, an aging relic of the worst parts of the 1950s (bigotry, intolerance, authoritarianism, and unwillingness to address structural abuse). The rest of the world is moving beyond those ideas, while the Boy Scouts remains firmly rooted in the past.

Even today, the Boy Scouts maintains that atheists and agnostics are barred from participating. It hearkens back to a time when only straight Christians were real people, and the best way to deal with abuse of power was a piping hot mug of “shut the fuck up and get in line.”

Furthermore, I would argue that the Nazis were strongly right wing (fascism is a right wing ideology) as they were reactionaries - they wished to return to a German nation state that they believed existed at the time of Otto Von Bismarck. Right wing throughout history has essentially meant reactionary, or the wish to preserve the status quo or go back to an idealised version of the past, rather than the beliefs that we think of as right wing now."

I don’t have an issue with movies discussing the impacts that being gay or black often have on people, i.e. I think it’s fine to mention the fact that our gay time traveller was rejected by his family in the 1950s but the whole entire story plot shouldn’t be centred around that and his flamboyant gay-ness."

Perhaps the second thing was just in the heat of the moment. But not letting his daughter watch star wars and play with lightsabers, or go camping and fishing?

BeautyGuruChatter,fqcx39z,t1_fe69lsw,1589271915.0,"Why do you have such a large issue with this guy who is just spreading general skincare knowledge and encouraging his audience to do things such as going to the dermatologist/aesthetician or using Paula's choice ingredient dictionary? Most people who watch his chanel do it as a gateway into becoming more involved in the skincare community and watching experts, including Dr. Dray, whose videos he has linked and referenced, and Kenna.

As for your reply to alynkas, that was extremely rude, generally unwarranted, and frankly immature. You compared someone's lack of knowledge or will to learn about skincare to be similar to reading books with pictures, which makes absolutely no sense as being able to read normal books is a basic life skill. Knowing about specific chemical reactions, beyond college level, most defintely is not. Alynkas is not stupid for not having an interest in learning in depth of chemical reactions, and within your reply, as you continued to bash her for this, you also failed to address her actual concern about her dermatologist not viewing her mole. Many dermatologists are bettering at addressing more serious health concerns, and I personally had to visit a aesthetician because of the fact that my dermatologist was not as interested in skincare as he was in specific skin conditions.

Furthermore, you call this the decline in education among US/UK citizens. This is again preposterous. College education rates have been steadily increasing, and it's not as if the average person 30 years ago had a deeper understanding of skincare or chemical formulations. Not spending large periods of time researching into something you're not deeply invested in isn't instant gratification, it is just becoming a slightly more well rounded person.

Finally, how is wanting to become an astronaut a more nobel or intellectual thing? It is not as if Chinese children wish to become researchers or astrophysicists, they're just attracted to what they see culturally popularized and a ""cool job."" Perhaps they are the idiots for believing there's a chance they'll become an astronaut."

This not only affects men negatively, who aren’t allowed to take care of kids or be goofy as fathers, or whatever other “girly” activity they enjoy, but it also forces moms into being the primary parent. In general, sexist behaviours negatively impacts everyone involved, stereotypes people, and forces us into roles that we may not like or be suited for from a very young age.

German troops don’t do anything outside of NATO, the EU and the UN. The federal government is extremely cautious about exercising power. Many people have a strong dislike of politicians that even sound like demagogues. 

This just proves how wrong waving the confederate flag is. Something can be part of your history and affect your culture without being good. Your people can do bad things and you can look back and say “woah we should never do that again.” Taking down statues isn’t erasing history, it’s enforcing what we have learned from history."
