He cheated, basic decline in respect for my body, stuff like that. He then ghosted ME and broke up with me days later via text. Yeah, I was like ""byeeeee"", bullet dodged. A couple weeks later, he shows up at my work ( a small pub at the time) and acted like everything was cool, he was trying to talk to me about like ""inside joke"" stuff and I was not engaging. He asked to stay the night at my house ""for old times sake"" and I told him no fucking way, dude. He left and after I closed the bar, I went to a friend's house for a few drinks myself and then went home. My house was TRASHED, my mattress was halfway down the stairs, food was thrown out of the fridge and cabinets, my electronics were smashed, it was chaos. He was waiting for me to get off work to ambush me and when I didn't show up, he got mad and went fucking atomic. I am SO glad that I went to an after bar that night as I got a skeevy feeling from him just showing up at my work like that.

I don't want to be handcuffed to methadone for the rest of my life, going into the clinic, getting drug screened all the time, being knocked back on my phase if I don't meet all requirements. It was never a life long thing I wanted to take on. I will admit, the past few days, I've been trying really hard to convince myself that going back on methadone was not what I was going to do. I've always just suffered with things. I told myself I wasn't going to beat myself up if I needed to go back on, but I already am. I'm at a huge crossroads and it's been eye opening. I know that telling my Gastroenterologist that stelara actually isn't working for me at all means I'm going to have to have surgery. Surgery means painkillers and it will be so easy at that point to say ""you deserve some relief"". I Don't want to be going to the clinic anymore. I don't want to do it for years and years. I just want to be free of that burden and get over these withdrawals. I thought they would be done by now.i just want real relief. I want to be content. I want to feel normal."

A big fear I have with being on such a low dose would be 'if this what sobriety feels like?' because it's not comfortable. I keep trying to tell myself that I'm just having slight withdraws and it will settle after I'm done for good, but what if this is just the normal setting for me now? What if I feel anxious and discontentment and kinda sick forever, with the Crohns it is a possibility that this is baseline. And if that's the case, can I resist the temptation to resist the relief? It all started with just wanting some relief from all the bad feelings. So, that's my biggest fear right now. I was happy, I thought I was. I was so calm and just content...I tricked myself into believing that with heroin, I was just better. I was more outgoing, had more energy because I didn't have to walk doubled over, had some basic human rights style relief. It was a trick though. I was deeply depressed, and I wasn't making myself feel better, I was ignoring the fact that I was feeling bad. Big difference. I hope you can get off it, too. I don't think it's too late. It'll be work, and you'll have to start with baby steps, but they will add up. 

Everyone talks about how if we ever traveled back through time, one slight misstep, one little action, could change the course of history. Nobody ever talks about how one little action we do now could change the course of our own future. I always liked that idea. I hope it helps."
Methadone,fgrn5yu,t1_fgqbxgj,1581051276.0,"No, Crohns is generic and incurable but the opiates cause constipation and pain relief, which is great even you're in pain and have diarrhea all the time. It's an immune issue, basically immune system sees interesting tract as a threat with certain things you ingest. Can't absorb any nutrients because they leave quicker than you can break even. At one point even they were trying to figure out what's wrong with me, I couldn't even keep water down. It's pretty horrible."

Methadone,fgpb91o,t1_fgos2c2,1581001219.0,"Thank you! And good on you as well :) biggest obstacle was my own fear. Of failing, of relapse, of not being strong enough, of my Crohns literally killing me, and in a way, of losing opiates themselves. They've been a part of my life for a really long time, and they are kinda like the warm blanket of depression. Not good for you, but you still find comfort in them. But, it's time to say goodbye to the toxic relationship and face that fear. I have to, or I WILL die. I saw a forked road, one way was keep doing what I was doing and die for sure. The other was do something about it, take a machete and cut my own path. I'm so happy for people in this program who are using it as the too they need to better themselves. Super awesome work."
Methadone,fgpaiw7,t1_fgowoaz,1581000751.0,"Yes, Crohns is a big reason I turned towards opiates in the first place. And I have a lot of bleeding issues/issues with the constipation being TOO much. For a while, going to the bathroom was worse than childbirth. And now that I'm really low, I think the worst part for me was also being afraid of what comes after. Crohns is breaking the surface now that I'm so low, but it's mild. I'm also on stelara. When I was regularly doing heroin and other opiates, that time muted the Crohns, but the Crohns kept getting worse under it all. So going from then to now, it's like.. I'm just worried that I won't be ready for it, that even 6mg is holding back the dam. That's part of the reason why I'm in these support type subs.

Methadone,fdj723l,t1_fdhp2ii,1578460273.0,"First off, congratulations on such a HUGE accomplishment! Over a year clean is amazing!! And getting SSI is difficult so I hope it goes through for you. They deny most claims the first time at least. I have Crohns disease and was in the hospital literally every month or two and lost my job because of it. and I was still denied. I honestly ramped up my opiate use around that time just to make ends meet and be able to get out of my situation. I'm in housing too, and I wouldn't be able to survive if I didn't have this place. First place in not dependant on an shitty boyfriend or a crappy roommate. Or my Nmom. 

As for the lower doses, they've been okay so far, not as bad as I breaded myself for, although I don't want to speak too soon because I'm still not done yet. I think this next part might be hard. Wouldn't feel right if it wasn't a trial of some kind. If I need to stop for a bit, I will. I know that being okay with stumbling and remembering that it's not a failure unless I don't get back up is important."

Methadone,fdf0z9x,t1_fdem9dp,1578350852.0,"First of all, congrats to you! And props as well, it takes courage to do this. I consider myself sober, because I'm not getting messed up or abusing methadone, but just me, I have always been super hard in myself and at the beginning it was really tough for me to even admit that I was proud of myself for something. I've always felt like a failure. It's been drilled into my head since I was a kid that I was a disappointment.. Different story..

Tapering down from 110 wasn't so bad. I did it at 2 mg per week and if I felt like it was too much to handle, I would plateau out until my body caught up. I also have Crohns disease so finding the balance was especially crucial, if I went too fast it spun me into a flare up. 

I was informed that the lower doses would be the hardest, and it makes sense if you think about it. Taking 2 mg off 110 is barely a drop in the bucket, but taking 2 mg off of 10 is cutting off a much larger percentage of your dose. So I'm a little anxious about these final 16mg. But slow and steady seem to be the best option, with plenty of time and patience given to yourself to recover and catch up if you need to. 

I wish you all the best in your journey, and let me know if I can answer any more questions for you. Stay strong!"

TooAfraidToAsk,fd7el1v,t3_ek0v8h,1578203252.0,"In 2007, I tried going to college and I was in a really bad place in life.  I did horrible, got a 1.8 GPA and dropped out after the first semester. Wasn't my time. I wasn't mature enough and didn't know enough about the 'real world' to take that on. ( I didn't have supportive or even present parents growing up until my mom married my now step-dad, but that's another story)


I'm a mom now. I've battled addiction and won. I've survived traumas and failures so maybe that there almost taken me out with them. I've grown so much. I funny even recognize that mindset anymore. Familiar and yet so distant..


I recently completed my first semester back, and got a 4.0 GPA. As proud of myself as I was, I got an email saying I was in danger of losing financial aid because my cumulative GPA was just above a 2 and my completion rate was below their minimum. They had to include my GPA and the fact that I withdrew after the second semester waaaay back in 2007. It was a LIFETIME ago. It felt just like the old me to leave a time bomb capable of reaching decades into the future to get me, though. 

I'm dealing with the blow. I'm getting a 4.0 and still barely keeping afloat. I do wish life wasn't so hell bent on teaching me the whole 'succeeding in the face of adversity' lesson ad nauseum, but maybe there's something there that I've missed."
TrueOffMyChest,fc9iga4,t1_fc8yiy6,1577553147.0,"For my major, I had to take a speech class. The first speech I did, my breath caught in my throat, I kept losing my place in the speech, and the loud, buzzing coming from inside my head made me almost pass out. I was shaky, hot, could feel my face turning red, my voice was wavering, I cried at one point.... But....

I got through it. And the next one I did was a little better. And the very last one I did was deemed ""powerful"" by my proffesser. Even with a shaky voice, and the deafening loudness of every silent eye staring at me, I got through it. I took my glasses off so I couldn't see anyone and focused on how important the message of my speech was for me. 
Wouldn't want to do it again, but going through it helped. I'm NOT comparing this to potlucks and after work drinks, because that forced camaraderie between co-workers is bullshit, and being seen as 'less than' for not wanting to participate is even bigger bullshit, I'm just saying, some lessons are more difficult to get through than others, but are worth it in the end.

The strength in the struggle."
TrueOffMyChest,fc9g2cj,t3_egly0r,1577552155.0,"The "" you should smile more"" thing is what drives me up a wall. I would look like an absolute nutter if I just walked around smiling at nothing all the live long day. YOU need to get out of my personal space more, including my personal head space. That and the "" you should get out more"". Like, no thanks... And then I get looked at like a psycho for not wanting to engage in these ' extracurricular ' activities. I do plenty, I paint, I have an extensive movie and book collection, I have a cat! I'm FINE. 

The absolute opposite-of-my-personality job I ever had was working as a bartender in a little hole in the wall bar. I learned my most valuable, stand-up-for-myself lessons there, though. As an introvert, I didn't really like confrontation but I was forced to use my outside voice and as a 5'4"", 105 lb petite woman, had to kick out big, scary, DRUNK men and sloppy, catty bitches so, I got my confidence. 

Don't fucking tell me to smile. Your version of fun and mine are NOT the same."
