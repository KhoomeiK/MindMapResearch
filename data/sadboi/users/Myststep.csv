We gave him CBD (Enlightened Organics) which definitely helped in the mornings, and evenings. The whining didn't mostly stop until I got a dog of my own. My dog would tire out my boyfriends dog to the point where he'd hide from my puppy or lay quietly in his cage.
Maybe your dog needs a friend? I would consult a dog trainer first. Maybe it's just a behavioral thing from not getting attention as a puppy? I think a professional would be able to better help you.
In our case my bfs dog just needed CBD and a friend to help get built up energy out.
(I was already planning on getting a dog. Talk to a trainer. Record your dog being bad, or have the trainer come to your home. Your dog may react differently in a new environment that smells like hundreds of dogs)"

Anyhow the first two weeks weren't that bad, I was vaping 0mg - 3mg occasionally and taking A LOT of CBD plus adding it to my vape juice. I think the CBD helped a lot honestly. I stopped vaping after week 2, and once the 3rd wk got over I've been fine
A few things I've noticed since quitting:
‚Ä¢I rarely cough now
‚Ä¢my skin is a lot better
‚Ä¢my headaches & migraines are happening less
‚Ä¢*most* cigarette smoke smells bad to me now
‚Ä¢my nails aren't as brittle 
‚Ä¢hair is healthier
I really recommend going cold turkey. Weaning yourself off doesn't work imo. I tried and I just ended up still smoking just less often. I also recommend CBD. I used Enlightened Organics, cause I don't like oil or flavoring. I've heard a lot of people like Charlotte's Web, though that one is on the expensive side.
Just do whatever you think works best for you! 
Maybe figure out what you like about smoking? Does it ""help"" you when you're anxious, upset, etc? Figure out out ways of coping 

I really hope you quit for good:)"
