Drugs,fmyxcig,t1_fmyx4ks,1586498724.0,We had to find what was needed to extract it from and then did the rest.  My husband did it so not entire sure what he did. I do know I trust him though as he is actually very I intelligent man luckily enough. If you look up how to make it I‚Äôm sure you can find what you need. I personally would never make my own as I don‚Äôt think I am capable enough to.
Drugs,fmyx744,t3_fy8m8s,1586498582.0,"As someone who is on Setraline, alcohol has been fine for me although each person can react differently. I still get tipsy/drunk as any normal person would and without having had side effects. As for smoking stuff I haven‚Äôt had it yet. Just remember sertraline is there to keep your serotonin levels at a consistent level so they don‚Äôt drop or increase. It doesn‚Äôt create serotonin as such but keeps your levels at a normal functioning level to create mood stability. Taking anything substance may react and cause these levels to fluctuate that may joe be felt till later on."

depression,ffm7n4j,t1_ffiu7kv,1580049879.0,I‚Äôm glad to hear it‚Äôs better for you now. I used to play the victim as well but came to the realisation that I can‚Äôt change them and I would need to leave my home environment ass soon as I possibly could. Now that I am away I can actually think better. I‚Äôm in a place that safe. I‚Äôm still battling battling depression but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be here now typing  today if I stayed there.

I cleaned the house the other day and he asked where I put his protein shaker in the most annoyed condescending way. Like why did I clean the house cause I do it wrong.Seriously WTF?! (FYI I left it in the same spot it normally sits, on top on the microwave) I try to be the happiest I can around him but sometimes he is just a so snappy it‚Äôs almost impossible some days.  Ahhh , thanks for the vent !"

depression,ffhtann,t3_etoolf,1579952802.0,"How do you get the motivation to get up? I started to walk 1 -2 hours a day recently. I did it for 3 days and when Wednesday showed up, I don‚Äôt think I moved from the bed. The next 3 days were horrendous. Walked again but could go longer than 15 mins. What gets you moving?"
depression,ffhsm1x,t3_etp61i,1579951789.0,My Dad is in a similar way. I support him secretly as I don‚Äôt want him to feel like he is failing as a father. I always ask his advice for what I should look out for when I get my car serviced and that usually turns into a 2 hour conversation. I try to bring his favourite food over when I visit as this gives him something to look forward to at a later time. I also encourage him to come on a walk with me as it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to walk 2 dogs when he‚Äôs around. This means he gets out of his house. I don‚Äôt know how supportive this all actually is but I want to get across the point to him how important he is to me. I can see it motivates him to keep going and to keeps him wanting to do better by me

depression,ff2pvnm,t3_edhcd2,1579518499.0,"Yep. I feel like if I wasn‚Äôt even there, wasn‚Äôt even apart of the group my absence would not make a difference to the group dynamic. I feel like I‚Äôm there to even the numbers up as everyone in the group is a couple. I have nothing of value to add and when/if I try give speaking a go, I get shut down by someone‚Äôs comment. I think to myself,  best if I keep quiet till‚Äô night is over."
