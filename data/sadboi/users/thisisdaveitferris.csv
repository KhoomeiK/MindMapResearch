bipolar,f7y1y00,t3_dy1anf,1574084056.0,"As a Bipolar singer-songwriter-musician myself, this topic can get a little murky. Let me explain why.

Most musicians are careful to not bang the same lyrical drum, especially on a structured release. So you're unlikely to find 3 songs about 'lost love' in sequence. Songwriters worth their salt are much more likely to sequence their releases to stagger their stories, so it could be;

1. *Song about Love*
2. *Song about hating oneself*
3. *Song about Nostalgia*
4. *Song about being a success*
5. *Song about loneliness*

So, it might come across quite Bipolar given the disparity of the topics. Also, most songwriters hoard their content over many years \[as I do\], so you may be hearing feelings from a decade or so ago that would feed into the up/down narrative, as opposed to a completely fresh batch of songs somewhat in the same vein, lyrically.

Personally, I'm a big fan of the '.com' test. Essentially, if you can get the .com for your business name, It's likely to be original. I use [namechk.com](https://namechk.com) before II launch any side projects and I ensure I get the .com \[then all the socials seem to be available, too\].

In terms of promotion, I don't really do a whole tonne If I'm being honest.

\- One component of a website that instantly gives it credibility is legit **testimonials**. I'm not implying your few are fake, but it's easy to type *'Awesome store! Tom, New York'.* Consider embedding facebook reviews, setting up a trustpilot, or at the very least associating these people via their full name / link to their profile.

\- You have the '®' symbol after your company name on there, but considering you mention in the comments you don't even own the .com and have considered changing the name, I'm guessing this isn't a legit? I'd remove this if i were you.

\- Your contact email via the website is [*crowncharmsstore@gmail.com*](mailto:crowncharmsstore@gmail.com) \- I would change this to something more professional like [Hello@CrownCharms.store](mailto:Hello@CrownCharms.store) \- It's easy to set this up and it adds a professional sheen to your site.

I know your predicament very well. I currently make music under three guises and I'm the only person involved at all; from the writing to performing, recording to mastering. It can be a tough \[and very lonely!\] journey.

Here's a few tips I've found to work in the past;

\- If you have 20 or so songs ready to roll, record a live take of all 20 of them and put them into a private soundcloud playlist and send them to some musically aware folks to help you hone them down to a much more manageable 12 or so - that'll remove some stress right off the bat. You're probably too close to the songs already to objectively whittle them down; so let others intervene.

\- Try and focus on one song at a time. I know you have a much bigger picture here, but don't allow the enormity of 'concept album' to spoil the individual parts. Pick a track and work on it like it's going to be your last ever contribution to audio. Then repeat until you have an albums worth.

\- You've taken a great first step by posting on here, If you need further help, post your ideas/songs/demos/mixes up here - you'll always find someone willing to help.

Best of luck!"
