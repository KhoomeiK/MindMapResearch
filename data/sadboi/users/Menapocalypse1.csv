EatingDisorders,ff63406,t3_erslfn,1579617929.0,May ask to Try Wellbutrin / bupropion as it helps with depression /anxiety and doesn’t make you gain weight .  You have ONE life. Think loooooong term .... do you want a healthy marriage? Kids who look to you for everything? How to eat? What to eat? How to take care of yourself? How to love yourself? How about being able to see the world? It’s all worth it to be healthy and strong for all life offers. Focusing on just being skinny.. well .. no one cares but YOU. No one is looking or judging.  It’s your own personal hell and life is too short to be known as the “girl who starved herself to death.” Your family will be devastated and for what? Be grateful for a strong body and mind that you nourish. Be grateful you live in a country that has too much food.. I doubt sub Saharan Africa has this problem. It helps to think outside yourself and have perspective. You don’t want osteoporosis or to make yourself infertile. Hope this helps.
