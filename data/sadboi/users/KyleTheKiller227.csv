FiftyFifty,fkfeguu,t1_fkegmv4,1584132613.0,And a literal fucking 13 isn't supposed to be a virgin or something? From what you sound like you prolly lost your virginity to a dog. I don't think being a host of dozens of STDs is something to be very proud of ngl
depression,fkfcra6,t3_fhu4s5,1584131578.0,Around other people I act like I'm happy (which momentarily around them I kinda am) and like I'm funny but when in reality I both want to like pretty much sink into a corner as well as become friends that can trust each other. I feel like if they knew how I really am and that I'm numb and apathetic most of the time they might not like or except me for who I really am. But like usual something happens to take that short period of happiness away.

FiftyFifty,fkd1vtl,t1_fkcxczx,1584066352.0,Yeah it's better to know that the person is fucked up and did horrible things to have that happen. If it's just  domestic violence for the sake of lack of trust issues it makes me not want to watch it even though I already unfortunately did.
FiftyFifty,fkd1m28,t1_fkcs54n,1584066170.0,So for the first time in a few months I'm actually mortified. I thanks for the link but I don't think I'll be needing it anymore.

Animesuggest,fk8kam1,t1_fk67157,1583957661.0,Yeah. I do like fairy tail but I love memeing about that
depression,fk8ji43,t1_fk68lx4,1583957227.0,"Yeah same. Not trying to sound edgy or anything but since I've come into 7th grade I've lost my ability to make friends like I used to, lost my self confidence and set up this sort of barrier from others in my grade and who used to be in my life."
depression,fk8f77k,t1_fk81yrc,1583954918.0,I kinda wish it were the end of the world because of all the damage humans have done for their own greed. And yeah I don't get the point of freaking out about something that you most likely won't get and even if you do most likely won't feel that bad.
depression,fk7fui3,t1_fk5rxvi,1583935563.0,"Ok will do. I'm sorry you have to go through that, and you're probably right. When I get mad I get one of the closest things I have and either hit it or as you described, have a strong urge to want to destroy it. 

After reading some of the other comments Im deciding that I should try and talk to people and try and get help."
depression,fk7f51g,t1_fk6h01p,1583935124.0,"This sounds about right. I usually have to bottle up my anger as well as having possible anger issues, but yeah I am having other possible symptoms. Unfortunately I don't have many friends or really any  people I trust and games usually build up my anger. Attempting for a therapist would likely be my best bet. 
Thank you for your input, It gave a bit more info on what could be going on."
