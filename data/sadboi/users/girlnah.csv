I am also a business owner and I have pretty severe GAD (generalized anxiety disorder)  that pretty much cripples me when I first wake up most mornings,  but I have found ways to manage it as soon as it happens so that I can be a functional adult.

I dont like telling other people what their experiences are when dealing with a mental ailment, but she is clearly using her anxiety as an excuse not to fulfill her job duties, and that is extremely annoying. 

Anxiety is not systematic. You cant plan it out and you definitely cant choose when and when not to have it. She is responsible for her mental healthcare and you are not obligated to kiss her feet and ignore the fundamental duties of running your business the way that it should be ran, simply because she has anxiety."
