HPPD,fr46nev,t3_gmkq4i,1589877674.0,Maybe you should give it a couple of months and/or not drive at all.
bipolar,fq5t5py,t3_ggzfks,1589116769.0,How did you get so many sections on daylio? I need that!
bipolar,fpyeiqr,t3_gg8vr4,1589002513.0,"Agree. I lost my best friend of 6 years, who is a self proclaimed depression-anxiety-PTSD advocate, etc. Can no longer support me because of that 'thing I have'. And I think he skipped out because he was afraid and didnt understand. If someone that close to me feels that way how will other people I haven't told yet? I dont expect to be understood, but I expect to be treated the same and with respect."
HPPD,fpm89ej,t3_geaawu,1588727586.0,what are your hppd visuals lile if you dont mind me asking?
LSD,fpjkvhl,t3_gdut6g,1588672338.0,"Try to calm down, listen to some relaxing music, lie down on the grass if you can, go for a run somewhere safe. You're going to be alright. If you've peaked its only going to settle down from now on."
bipolar,fp1gf9o,t3_galjs0,1588234658.0,Would be great to hear how you're managing! :) I'm also not on medication and would like to hear another person's perspective of coping
bipolar,foy0k3i,t1_foxubdi,1588162193.0,so sorry to hear. cant imagine how painful that would be.
bipolar,foy0iqh,t1_foy04xc,1588162161.0,I would never tell my parents either.
bipolar,fmnmo66,t1_fmnecyc,1586229684.0,"this is exactly how it appears to me as well!! I'm wondering if its remnants of HPPD from years of taking too much LSD, and when manic my brain goes into hyperactivity and brings back these types of visuals. That or just the mania."
bipolar,fkfjbev,t3_fi3uqz,1584135665.0,Wow I would buy this!
bipolar,fk3qrqp,t3_fgbmdk,1583843695.0,"I can relate to this, it's exciting and makes you feel good when someone you like likes you too, so everything feels good and amplified"
