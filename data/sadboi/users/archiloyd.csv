whatsthisrock,fqen5th,t1_fov75qq,1589310329.0,In that area ( Glendale Narrows) only the sides are concrete.the bottom is semi natural.places where it transfer's from concrete to natural there is drops holes and  places where heavys accumulate  .tons of metals and junk .in some places this stuff turns into a big black rock similar to asphalt.I call this rock( LA River clusterfuckite) if you can find it and break it down . you can't always get at least 1 piece of broken jewelry sometimes (au) or 925 or just bling.my wife found a platinuim diamond engagement ring valued at about 10k.its not always we find good stuff down there but it's fun to look.

infj,fpg9b1a,t3_g3plnn,1588597694.0,Much feelings of inadequacy and just shutting it down in quarantine and some over analysis of why humans say and do what they do.just taking things to personally
whatsthisrock,foxpm6j,t3_g9krq1,1588151819.0,"There Alot of pot holes and crevices and places where heavy things stay
I dig in these holes and find what I call ""cluster fucks "" it's a bunch of all kinds of metals nails bolts nuts sometime broken Jewelry rings and Alot of other junk ect rusted together to form a rock that looks like red asphalt I smash it up and go through it."

ptsd,flfxtqc,t3_fok9ew,1585122105.0,Absolutely so it's been a treat when nothing triggers you and that you can actually have alone time in ones mind to unwind the never ending analysis of everything and everyone. It's so different and I just want to be happy and for all to be happy.

bigfoot,fkdlfqp,t3_ffbuyt,1584083544.0,I am native and I am from the salt River Pima tribe and I was working for a all native youth summer camp . We came across some big foot tracks on a hike and there was some pictures taken. (Mysteriously the camera was lost.) We headed back to camp and we told the elder of  the Paiut'e  (local tribe) and shared the news about the big foot print. He directed us to the Eldest lady who was like 98 years young. She told us without no hesitation that it was real and they come out mostly in summertime to drink water and hunt. She told us that they have characteristics of a bear. What was surprising was that she wasn't scared and that is actually normal behavior around the place we found the tracks. That is all the information I have unfortunately without the photo. Things that your not supposed to talk about traditional people don't talk about much.
spirituality,fjmycw4,t3_fe4db8,1583490178.0,Yeah thanks for that sometimes u think things like that were supposed to happen to you especially when u put yourself in those kind of situations and if it happens to me then it was supposed to happen. That is what I think.
