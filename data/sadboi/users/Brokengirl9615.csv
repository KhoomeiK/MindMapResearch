My husband is aware and understanding of this, it’s more like a “need” than a “want” I guess I haven’t really healed from my past yet either, I’m on medication and tried therapy as well, I think the best bet is to just accept and embrace that you’re different. Being mature isn’t a bad thing, and a good friend will understand that you were raised differently (mine do) sometimes if you’re really craving closeness to a friend you might have to explain these things to them, because while there’s nothing wrong with you, or the way you cope, we are different and we can’t expect everyone to just understand with no backstory. Anyways I’ll wrap it up, there’s nothing wrong with you, embrace who you are. This is your life, and he is no longer in control. You are."

Which means SOMETHING happened, and you’re not lying to yourself. What would be the point? That’s what I ask myself when I questions stuff, not “AM I lying?” But “WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT in lying”?

I started working for the company I currently work for, when I was 16, male dominated as well, I fell for every authority figure, I ended up dating my boss, and he ended up being abusive and raping me. I guess deep down we KNOW being with these men is not what we WANT but what we NEED. It’s exhausting, I agree. But it can heal. I’m married now, my husband and I are both the same age, and I’m HAPPY. I found that it’s not their age I’m attracted to, but their personality. Find out what it is you’re seeking in this older men, and try to start finding it in non-married men, you’re fully comfortable being with. It’s hard, but there are men that are mature younger than 40 (rarely). Also as embarrassing as it is, being a submissive and letting my husband be in control sexually, actually was a MAJOR help.

Now that’s not to say he’s ever hurt you or abused you but it is possible, I have the same feelings about my dad, and he was abusive. I don’t think it’s fair to yourself to compare your situation to others, you are allowed to feel what you feel, now harboring resentment is exhausting, now that you’re 18 it may be time to look into therapy to see if you can get to the root of these issues, and that way you will find the best ways to solve them.

Essentially a way to remind ourselves that it’s dangerous to sleep. It always helped me to lucid dream.

I was saying “nope she didn’t mean to kill him and it was self defense” I never said it had anything to do with color or not to do with color?? I actually agree she was unfairly treated her mom spoke about it as well. I never said it was her fault??? I’m so confused.

People don’t lie about this stuff, and even when they do, every lie has some truth in it. I believe you."
IAmaKiller,fi5u2yd,t1_fi5tx9q,1582170645.0,"Nope! She messed up and that’s what she said at the beginning “I’m not a bad person, I just did a bad thing” just ironic how she got imprisoned for this whole time, and the people that assaulted her for her entire life got nothing."
adultsurvivors,fi5ttp4,t1_fi5q21d,1582170488.0,"I agree that it affects us, but we have the power to control how and what we do to control ourselves. We can choose our own paths. Not all of our power was stolen from us."
adultsurvivors,fi5tp3l,t1_fi5qqem,1582170412.0,Yes!!!! Or how you should act and if you don’t act that way you’re lying!
adultsurvivors,fi5tn7s,t1_fi5rirr,1582170384.0,Ugh same! I’m so sorry about that :/ I have the same issue people find out I was abused and worry I’m abusing my son. (Whom I would never hurt EVER) and it pisses me off
IAmaKiller,fi5tia3,t3_f6mh95,1582170305.0,"This one bothered me too!!! I mean even if she DID lie about spending the night Friday, and if she DID lie about forgetting she had the gun who cares??? If he was gonna force her to perform sexual acts and she killed him, then that’s self defense."
IAmaKiller,fi5tetw,t1_fi5t0dw,1582170251.0,I’m thinking she meant the prosecutor was an old white man.
