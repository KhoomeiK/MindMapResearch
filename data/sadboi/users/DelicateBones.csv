Your body is going to want to redeposit fat where it’s most necessary (around vital organs) before it goes anywhere else. I read about this on some recovery website that noted the initial gain as a potential trigger for people trying to recover from eating disorders. They said that the tummy gains are temporary and fat will begin to deposit more evenly with continued weight gain. It could also be bloat.

When I went home to visit my family, I had just told them about being diagnosed with an ED.

So of course as soon as I walk through the door, I’m greeted by disapproving and concerned looks from my step father, and then my mom chimes in that I’m not /that/ skinny, and the recovery center is probably just using me as an easy insurance claim lol. I’m not underweight, but I’m close to it, and even now after hashing it out with my mom about how minimizing my disorder is NOT helpful, she still maintains that x amount of pounds over the underweight category is totally fine, and I probably don’t need as intensive therapy as recommended. But let me tell you, it was suuuuuuuper awkward just standing there for about an eternity with both of my parents studying my body, making comments about my weight, and even arguing with each other about it. I think people who aren’t stuck in an ED mindset, don’t really see how much of an impact their comments can make. We’re getting to a place in society where there’s more bOdY pOsItIvItY, and women are striving to be “thicc AF”...  So even though your mind immediately takes those kinds of comments and runs with them, most people probably don’t mean it in a negative way, or mean for it to be perceived in a negative way.

Definitely give it another try! If you’re lucky enough to live in a big city like I do, with multiple clinics, try a different clinic. My care team takes on the approach of yeah, I need higher care, like NEED it, but what can they do in the meantime to give me PHP level care and support with the time they have working with me, and get me on track to being more stable to try getting into PHP with everything else I have on my plate, or find the next best option. Recovery shouldn’t just be an option for those with perfect life circumstances, and I really hope you find a team that realizes that, this time around! 
Also, just going to warn that a lot of RDs won’t work with someone needing a high level of care if you don’t already have a psych working with you, because they won’t, in good consciousness, take your money if they don’t think it’ll be beneficial for you.

I find that’s where all the calories come from, even when using sugar replacement like swerve. If you are just dyyying for cookies, and that’s what you want/need. I suggest just making a normal recipe, and cutting down part of the calories using swerve sugar replacement. You can find it at most Whole Foods stores, or check the website for the store locator. Call ahead though, because I found that it can be misleading. They have 0 cal brown sugar which will be relatively handy for cookie baking. Honestly though, I’ve found the easiest way to get a dessert fix while keeping it low cal is just making a mug cake with the replacements. Under 200 calories for a decent sized treat. Otherwise, you’re just going to have to tweak a recipe and still focus heavily on portion control."

EDAnonymous,evht3x5,t3_cjw96l,1564531772.0,"I’ve been really digging this recipe:
2 tablespoons of miso paste
3 tablespoons of rice vinegar 
Teeny dash of sesame oil
1/2 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
And a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.
Then just water to desired consistency. I like mine a little thinner so it comes out to around 35 cals for 2-3 tablespoons worth."

I’m sure the people who are close to them, and know them, can intervene. It’s nice that you’re concerned and you want to do the right thing. But if someone I wasn’t comfortable with approached me about my weight, I would be pretty taken aback."

fuckeatingdisorders,evbois4,t1_evbobha,1564386404.0,Why are you even on this sub? Just to give out advice on something you have no personal experience with? Weird.
fuckeatingdisorders,evbogex,t1_evbobha,1564386312.0,Rash of you to assume I just want attention. But again. I’m not taking treatment advice from a chronic failure. I don’t have to disclose my current recovery plan with you. That’s between me and my psych.
fuckeatingdisorders,evbo1cs,t1_evbngsg,1564385731.0,"I’m saying that you should really reconsider handing out recovery advice. I like to consider the source of where advice is coming from, aka “stalking”. Really renders your opinion as invalid."

fuckeatingdisorders,evbmpyx,t1_evbmk26,1564383936.0,"I’m not actually. I don’t have the time for that, dear. It’s just common knowledge what alcohol dependency does to one’s body. Organs, teeth, skin. Yuck. At least with AN I can focus on harm reduction. There’s no stopping alcohol from deteriorating all of you. Or what’s left of you for that matter."
fuckeatingdisorders,evbme6p,t1_evbmac9,1564383495.0,"So is raging alcoholism. Makes you nice and bloated. Also says the person who is spending so much of their time and energy continuing this conversation. You seem really triggered, and at this point this is really just entertaining for me."
fuckeatingdisorders,evbm3wp,t1_evblyci,1564383119.0,Cool story. Again. Good luck on your next recovery. Should be a breeze this time around.
fuckeatingdisorders,evblq8v,t1_evblhyg,1564382626.0,Didn’t take so much stalking as it did one click and a top post from only a month ago. Maybe make sure your own shit doesn’t stink before you go handing out the expert advice.
fuckeatingdisorders,evblday,t1_evblaae,1564382173.0,"I don’t have that issue. Alcohol has calories, but I’m sure you’re a pro at recovery from so much practice. That must be why you’re the expert here."

fuckeatingdisorders,evbd8in,t1_evbd2mu,1564373277.0,"No, because you’re making actual treatment recommendations when you’re not part of my treatment team. Your pursuit to be right about something has gone completely off topic, which was asking for help in goal development. General goal development. And in the process, making (me), the OP, even more apprehensive about recovery. That’s what you’ve achieved here."
fuckeatingdisorders,evbcy2u,t1_evbcv6y,1564373003.0,Cool story bro. You’re not helping.
fuckeatingdisorders,evbcp7q,t1_evbbr5l,1564372765.0,"Well thank god you’re not my RD then, and hopefully she doesn’t share that sentiment. Because to me, it’s like being asked to jump into the deep end without knowing how to swim. The result is drowning. You need to start in shallow water before taking on the bigger challenge. For me, drowning is an absolute mental breakdown and withdrawing from treatment entirely. I need to be able to be comfortable with the skills before submerging myself in harder tasks. And I beg to differ that it’s like drug addiction. You need food to live, you don’t need drugs to live. You don’t learn how to coexist with your drug addiction, but you do learn how to coexist with your food triggers."
fuckeatingdisorders,evbb9xq,t1_evbb3i5,1564371454.0,"Thanks! I’ve considered this. Daily sounds overwhelming, but I was thinking maybe she’ll negotiate twice a week, moving up to every other day, and so on. She kind of has this attitude of, “you’re PHP level, so sink or swim 😐” so I’m not sure how flexible she’s willing to be with me after one meeting, which adds a bit to the anxiety. But I could definitely work on a gradual increase."
EDAnonymous,ev9vjow,t3_cixdkg,1564332314.0,"Probably useless advice because I know how hard it is to put action behind the words, but damn bby, take the care. ☹️ Do what you need to do to get better. It probably momentarily felt good to get the b/p out of your system, but now look at where it got you. It didn’t make you feel happy or fulfilled, right? It just satisfied a temporary urge, but made you feel worse in the long run. So recovery is probably going to be the opposite of that. It’s going to be really hard, and really uncomfortable.. but you have a shot at being better if you just go through the motions and try to get through it. If you’re having really strong urges, talk them out with your care team. Tell them what you’re going through and why. Maybe if they understand, they’ll be able to help you get through it and stay accountable. I’m not recovered, but I’m working with a team currently. I definitely want to run for the hills just thinking about what’s expected of me, and goals that I have to meet. But I’m actively trying to push past some of that discomfort and set up a safety bet of a few trusted individuals who can help urge me forward when I want to turn the other way and run. I wish you the best of luck, and I really hope that when shit gets tough, you get tougher. 💜"

fuckeatingdisorders,ev5ytah,t1_ev5q6nx,1564240416.0,"I guess that’s where I’m having issues. I’ve never been ritualistic, or had many “rules”.. but I have a lot of fear foods. And the thing is that I can eat fear foods here and there on my own accord. But the idea of someone challenging me to do it when I don’t want to is really not sitting well with me, and making me really hesitant to jot down, “incorporate more restricted foods into my diet”. I also know that the amount of calories I’m consuming is unhealthily low, so a reasonable goal would be to increase my intake, but that’s another thing that’s making my anxiety shoot straight through the roof."
fuckeatingdisorders,ev4cqef,t1_ev4ciip,1564211642.0,"Thanks.
All of these things sound absolutely terrifying to me right now. :[
I know the go to goal is to incorporate fear foods back into my diet, but the thought of actually eating those things makes my skin crawl and makes it hard for me to actually write it down on my list of goals."
