As a rule of thumb, I avoid the scale for at least a week if I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm going to see a lot of water weight in the number. Second. Don‚Äôt over compensate and get extra restricty on yourself. Drink lots of water. Last time I had a lot of retention from eating stuff I don‚Äôt normally eat while on vacation, and I was feeling extra bloaty, someone suggested dandelion tea. It seemed to help a lot. The most important thing is to just get hydrated, don‚Äôt punish yourself, and definitely don‚Äôt beat yourself up over it."
1200isplenty,evmqeo6,t3_ckf8f6,1564611736.0,"I‚Äôm vegan, so all of my recipes are of that variety. However. Cookies are especially hard to keep the calorie count down because they use a lot of butter. I find that‚Äôs where all the calories come from, even when using sugar replacement like swerve. If you are just dyyying for cookies, and that‚Äôs what you want/need. I suggest just making a normal recipe, and cutting down part of the calories using swerve sugar replacement. You can find it at most Whole Foods stores, or check the website for the store locator. Call ahead though, because I found that it can be misleading. They have 0 cal brown sugar which will be relatively handy for cookie baking. Honestly though, I‚Äôve found the easiest way to get a dessert fix while keeping it low cal is just making a mug cake with the replacements. Under 200 calories for a decent sized treat. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just going to have to tweak a recipe and still focus heavily on portion control."

2 tablespoons of miso paste
3 tablespoons of rice vinegar 
Teeny dash of sesame oil
1/2 tablespoon fresh grated ginger
And a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper.
Then just water to desired consistency. I like mine a little thinner so it comes out to around 35 cals for 2-3 tablespoons worth."

fuckeatingdisorders,evbcp7q,t1_evbbr5l,1564372765.0,"Well thank god you‚Äôre not my RD then, and hopefully she doesn‚Äôt share that sentiment. Because to me, it‚Äôs like being asked to jump into the deep end without knowing how to swim. The result is drowning. You need to start in shallow water before taking on the bigger challenge. For me, drowning is an absolute mental breakdown and withdrawing from treatment entirely. I need to be able to be comfortable with the skills before submerging myself in harder tasks. And I beg to differ that it‚Äôs like drug addiction. You need food to live, you don‚Äôt need drugs to live. You don‚Äôt learn how to coexist with your drug addiction, but you do learn how to coexist with your food triggers."

EDAnonymous,ev9vjow,t3_cixdkg,1564332314.0,"Probably useless advice because I know how hard it is to put action behind the words, but damn bby, take the care. ‚òπÔ∏è Do what you need to do to get better. It probably momentarily felt good to get the b/p out of your system, but now look at where it got you. It didn‚Äôt make you feel happy or fulfilled, right? It just satisfied a temporary urge, but made you feel worse in the long run. So recovery is probably going to be the opposite of that. It‚Äôs going to be really hard, and really uncomfortable.. but you have a shot at being better if you just go through the motions and try to get through it. If you‚Äôre having really strong urges, talk them out with your care team. Tell them what you‚Äôre going through and why. Maybe if they understand, they‚Äôll be able to help you get through it and stay accountable. I‚Äôm not recovered, but I‚Äôm working with a team currently. I definitely want to run for the hills just thinking about what‚Äôs expected of me, and goals that I have to meet. But I‚Äôm actively trying to push past some of that discomfort and set up a safety bet of a few trusted individuals who can help urge me forward when I want to turn the other way and run. I wish you the best of luck, and I really hope that when shit gets tough, you get tougher. üíú"

But the idea of someone challenging me to do it when I don‚Äôt want to is really not sitting well with me, and making me really hesitant to jot down, ‚Äúincorporate more restricted foods into my diet‚Äù.
