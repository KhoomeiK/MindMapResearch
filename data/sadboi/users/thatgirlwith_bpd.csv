I can feel the pain you are going through now, but maybe be mindful on how you may recover in the future and if you may regret removing them completely- coming from a very impulsive person lol.

I would wait on responding and really think how YOU want your relationship with her to look like. It sounds like you truly want a good relationship with her, but maybe reflect on if there is any pressure to normalize things for you. For me, it was so much easier pushing down emotions to have a relationship with my family. I want a loving family and to be a part of it, but I can‚Äôt forgive the abuse I suffered and how it‚Äôs affected my life now.   Would having a relationship with her be the healthiest thing for you?
