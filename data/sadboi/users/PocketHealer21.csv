A solid team is flexible. It's nice to have a hammer that aids in knocking the monster out. You need someone to play DPS to get that damage in. Insect Glaives specialize in mounting the monster, allowing said Hammer to do his job etc

So if he's pursuing being the damage dealer, then you want to find your own role and play and learn it. Personally, I play a build that uses the ability ""wide range"". It's a Healer build essentially, and it works by consuming potions that the rest of the team also gains its effects. Making sure everyone stays alive makes the game really fun for me."
