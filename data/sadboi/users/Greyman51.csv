I certainly tried. I burned out of three stints at some very costly colleges that have just indebted me for life. all prior to diagnosis.

correctional services, policing and addictions counselling. I worked in mental health facilities as a security guard from 2012-2018

May 2019 i was kicked on the street by my then spouse while in the policing college (she wanted kids and i said i was not comfortable with that) I had to withdraw from school and go to newfoundland to live with my cousin, left my pills at the apartment so then I ended up suicidal in psych assessment on my birthday, NL family kicked me back to Nova Scotia a month later where I tried two more times and ended up on a secure unit, it was here that BPD was introduced. 

the last three years prior to diagnosis ive been beyond exhausted, debt sky rocketing and nothing has been going right, was on an anti depressant for a long time that I guess.. the way the ER doc explained on the night that I was put on unit was that.. essentially the meds went opposite to their intended use on me. 

I was on this anti depressant for at least a solid five years, unchanged. I never have been good at talking it out with my doctor or explaining those kinds of things and now i just feel fucked beyond repair. 

decreased inhibition and risky endeavours got me into drugs and alcohol, i didnt self harm before the meds. I cleaned up my act in the last month as far as quitting weed and drinking and thought I was ahead but it feels like it was pointless.

im renting a bedroom for 600 dollars in the city and had to get some work lined up at a college as a security guard, i hate this business. its so low paying, its low respect, long hours, the public are one giant collective bag of cock and the schedule is just beating the shit out of me. 

im on 3-11's with a 2 hour commute by bus each way. I cant keep this up and im only two days in. my weekends are occupied by training for pro wrestling (now thats a wild ass dissociative episode for another time how this happened) 

indy wrestling shows have been like my one happy place in life for the last 3 years, 

but right now im so poor i cant eat right, I eat a single meal a day usually a ""day of expiry"" (discounted) deli sandwich from the grocery store or a muffin from a coffee shop and have no money to get gym time in outside of the ring to get in proper shape 

so im getting things hurt and tweeked a lot.

im almost 30 and the only jobs i can get are security jobs, i could not even get a grocery store to look at me, and because I had training on the weekends all of the call centers in town i tried would tell me to fuck off for not being available between 4am to midnight every single day

PEI and NB also deliver a lot of transport for care to be provided at the QEII which certainly extends things. All of these things probably get compounded by the doctor shortage.
