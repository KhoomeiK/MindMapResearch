nextfuckinglevel,fqqezu2,t1_fqq3yet,1589564376.0,"I do contact staff juggling and most of what he's doing is actually the easiest shit in contact juggling. Staff spinning requires some arm strength, coordination and knowledge of how the staff behaves, but it's really not that hard to learn, especially with such a light staff. 
However, throwing it, doing a pirouette and caching is somewhat tricky, but still managable. Hard are the few contact elements he does, letting the staff spin around his body.

It still looks cool, though."
HistoryMemes,forw2ho,t1_forfjm9,1588019518.0,"Bc communism doesn't have eternal war, ethnic extermination and such written into it's ideology. Whatever you may think, at it's core communism is a utopian idea about a society in which everyone is a free and equal person.
It's the (extremely varied) attempted execution of that idea that cost millions of people their lives, and that is horrible. But the fundamental idea of communism is not equally horrific as the idea of national socialism.
Also, communism is a very diverse school of thought without one percise definition."

Please don't put yourself down over what happened, you are Not at fault here. Do you have somewhere to go where you could spend a night or two to rest and rehabilitate away from your husband? If you feel ready for it and they're available in your country, maybe try calling an emotional Support hotline or talk to someone you trust who is Not your husband. I am so sorry you had to go through this, stay strong and don't let him or anyone gaslight you into thinking it's your fault."
