BipolarReddit,fjzdu6t,t3_fcwlm4,1583717397.0,"I don’t know. I used to smoke more often before I was diagnosed and it helped me relax after a long day but now I’ve noticed that sometimes it’ll trigger anxiety and panic attacks. I smoke rarely now, usually when I know I’ve been sleeping well and my moods have been stable but I’m scared to smoke more often."
BipolarReddit,fjzd5s3,t3_dvqs5e,1583716941.0,Therapy and I started taking magnesium and iron which I think is helping me get less anxiety and panic attacks.
BipolarReddit,fjzcupl,t3_fe71r1,1583716738.0,"I feel you, I get this. Let him know how you feel. I always try to let my husband know how much I love and appreciate him and all that he does. I get fixated on things, pick fights and give him hell sometimes. I know I can be a lot to deal with especially my rage which I’m getting better at controlling. When you’re arguing with your partner and things start getting heated, let him know you gave to cool off and step out of the room until you can talk to him calmly. This is something I still struggle with but at least he’ll see that you’re trying. I hope this helps."
BipolarReddit,fjzcc9e,t3_ferl81,1583716395.0,I constantly worry about this all the time when I think of having kids and I’m so sorry you’re going through this. My husband always says that even  if my child does have bipolar disorder they will have me there every step of the way to help them manage the symptoms and have a stable life. I hope this helps!
BipolarReddit,fjzbdpl,t3_fdw20o,1583715752.0,I don’t know if it’s normal and everyone with bipolar disorder goes through times like these but it happens to me once in a while. I try to think about how devastating it will be for the ones I love and care for. I take it dat by day and try to think of everything I’m thankful for. Stay strong!
BipolarReddit,fjzb0ek,t3_fe3cvh,1583715502.0,"I have a lot of guilt and shame for my past actions and words before I was diagnosed and even afterwards. We’re all human beings, people make mistakes. Everyone fucks up and shit happens. You can send out the letters if they will make you feel better because sometimes it’s good to get things off your chest and apologizing for your past mistakes regardless of the how others react, is a step towards bettering yourself. You just have to learn from it and forgive yourself for whatever happened."
BipolarReddit,fjzaadw,t3_feigrh,1583715013.0,I took it for 3 years and it helped manage my moods but I was always dehydrated and it really broke me out. I switched over to lamictdal last year and it’s been great! Plus I have clear skin again!
BipolarReddit,fjza55a,t3_feowng,1583714915.0,Shoot me a message! :)
BipolarReddit,fjz9ysa,t3_fewsx3,1583714794.0,"I thought about telling my boss as well but I decided not to because of the stigma about mental health disorders. 

I told my boss at my previous workplace about my PTSD and regretted it immediately after all my coworkers found out about it and started acting differently towards me. 

I would advise you against it."

mentalhealth,fjw2qi2,t3_ff26fd,1583633817.0,"I was in and out of the hospital for suicidal ideation after being in denial about my diagnosis of bipolar II. With the right medications, Drs, and support of family and friends I’m a lot more stable and doing better. There is HOPE. Thank you for sharing and I’m so proud of you :)"
