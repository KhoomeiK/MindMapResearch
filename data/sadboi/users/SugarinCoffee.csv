cna,fmw1x8i,t3_fxqbdy,1586437599.0,"You will probably be orientating with an experienced CNA. Learn what they do, ask questions, be nice to all the staff you meet! You‚Äôll be seeing them a lot and will probably be asking for help for the first month or so. Everyone has experienced being a green CNA, you‚Äôre not a lone in that"
AskAnAmerican,fmw1mpr,t3_fxjcxk,1586437388.0,"I love it since it allowed my boyfriend to start two businesses from nothing, both still growing successfully. He gets to make is own hours, doesn‚Äôt have a boss. Gets to do what he loves without the hassle of having to do it for someone else. There are good and bad things about capitalism but I like that he has the opportunity to do these things"
cna,fmw18e4,t3_fxrgkw,1586437103.0,Put it in a scrub pocket so you can feel/ hear notifications but not actually wear it if in a nursing home job. I wear mine on my wrist for hospital jobs but never in a nursing home
cna,fmeys94,t3_funekj,1586016430.0,"Your back will hurt after awhile, feet always sore. You‚Äôll probably see residents being mistreated, most nursing homes are run very poorly with terrible management and uncaring staff. A lot of coworkers are lazy and will leave residents soaked in their own feces and urine before turning that assignment over to you. Nurses will ask you to lie for them on charts. You‚Äôll have to remember to have compassion and never cut corners, you don‚Äôt want to end up like those people. Hopefully you end up at a good facility, just know that it‚Äôs tough work and you‚Äôll see a lot of heartbreaking and difficult things in your career as a CNA no matter where you work. I love my job but it‚Äôs no cake walk"
RhodeIsland,flzbruq,t3_frtx2r,1585619983.0,"You should talk to local nursing homes, they‚Äôre the ones forced to use plastic wrap instead of temperature probe covers and wearing patient gowns instead of isolation gowns, as well as reusing face masks by putting them under UV light to kill bacteria. Care New England is also accepting donations I believe."

You could always bring another CNA in with you to help with particularly combative pts. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask more experienced CNAs for tips on dealing with it

rapecounseling,fhb61u0,t3_f29sc6,1581435568.0,"She was drugged if she doesn't remember anything. What part of ""she remembers nothing after she and her friends were handed drinks ..."" obviously the drinks were spiked. She was  so out of it she had no awareness of who she was, who the men were, or what was going on. You're an idiot if you think she was a willing participant in that. She was in an altered mental status due to the drugs. Literally re-read your first paragraph and ask yourself if anyone would be a willing participant in that situation. To be honest if you're too weak of a man to be able to put your own pathetic ego aside about this, you should leave so she can be with a man who won't judge and victim blame her."
