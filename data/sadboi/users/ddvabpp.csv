BipolarReddit,f9lo83l,t3_e5nuqg,1575427859.0,"Same exact story here, Thanksgiving was my 1 year mark. There was so much anxiety surrounding it. You are so right, self care is important,  knowing your limits, taking care of your body, and especially making sure to get good sleep. We made it through a huge milestone. Congrats dude"
bipolar,ewdjrvg,t3_cnc3r0,1565301973.0,"Same, my sister remembers so much more of our childhood than I do. To the point where I feel like she makes stuff up but then it started happening with my husband too so I just tend to have big lapses in memory :/ this was before meds too"
bipolar,ewc39k7,t3_cnc3r0,1565277135.0,I've experienced something similar. I don't quite remember everything from my manic phases or when I do awful things. My husband will tell me what I've done and I'll have little to no recollection sometimes... it's scary
BipolarReddit,ew9tt8g,t3_cneem9,1565231044.0,It gives me a lot of energy unless i take in as soon as i wake up and usually with coffee. If i take it in the afternoon then i start to feel antsy or  pretty energized
bipolar,ew4sejk,t3_cmqywy,1565117305.0,How amazing!!!! I'm so proud of you! Those are MAJOR reasons for celebration!!!
bipolar2,evvhefz,t1_evtknva,1564836943.0,Okay üòä
bipolar2,evkbytw,t3_cjvg1d,1564579142.0,"25 f tx, also have 2 kiddos which makes me feel older than I am sometimes ü§£ 

How have you been lately? I'm always looking for someone to talk to so feel free to message me üòÅ"
BipolarReddit,eucj239,t1_eua503s,1563676531.0,"What you've written makes sense. I really want to be able to talk to him. I told my best friend everything. Even if it was something mundane or just a random thought in my head. I want that kind of relationship with my husband too but I am also a pretty negative person and it can be too much for him.

I like the idea of a nightly talk or a check-in. We need something like that. I do need to find other ways of communicating how I'm feeling instead of just reacting and saying the first thing that comes out of my mouth. I've been writing the past couple days and I feel like that has helped a lot. I basically write things I want to tell him and it eventually works itself out to what I'm actually trying to say. 

Thank you for the response, I really appreciate another point of view."
BipolarReddit,eu9uq2v,t1_eu9ueyz,1563591364.0,Thanks. I still have my bad days but I'm able to reign it in better than before meds. I mostly just drown out my thoughts with Netflix or podcasts.
Asexual,eu64vh5,t3_cev2dv,1563492198.0,"I wish I had references to share with you but I only have my personal experiences. 

I don't exactly have ""fantasies"" or anything I particularly want out of sex either, at least none that I would ever dream of acting on. What my husband and I did that was helpful was we went really slow and we basically talked the whole time about random things and telling each other what felt good so he would know since we don't get turned on in the same way.  He gets turned on just by going down on me but I need a physical sensation to get in the mood. I don't know if that makes sense."
bipolar,eu4i9tr,t1_etwu6dl,1563454725.0,Target has plastic plates for $0.79 (we have 2 toddlers) we haven't bought real plates in a while. Also we only have maybe 6 plates total for our family of 4 to cut down on the amount of dishes that end up in the sink

bipolar,eq9pw75,t1_eq9oko0,1559914795.0,Sunday Service was amazing! I wish I could go to one
bipolar,eq9ohgc,t3_bxudhp,1559913659.0,"I feel like he was still written off at some points though, I loved Kanye's part of the interview, I didnt like the audience or david letterman so much. I broke down when Kanye was talking about being manic in the hospital. He described it perfectly"
BipolarReddit,eq9n9x9,t3_bxsa6v,1559912631.0,I was in the same boat not too long ago. I had a full blown psychosis episode in front of all my husbands family. It was really embarrassing. I was terrified of going back. In the end though it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was scared I would become manic again but things ended up being okay and my anxiety subsided a lot. I was proud of myself for facing my fears and going through with it. I hope the same goes for you! Good luck üòä
