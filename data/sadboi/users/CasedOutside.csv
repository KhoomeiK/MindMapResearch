Did you hear that oil prices went negative? Are you aware of the implications this will have for countries like Nigeria and Venezuela? It could mean a complete and total collapse of their societies. How many people will die?

Do you know the impact it will have on the continuing price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia? Do you know what will happen to ex USSR oil producing companies?

Do you know what will happen to US oil producing companies? Are you aware of how that will affect prices when things reopen? (A massive inflation since only the Saudis and Russia will still be pumping) Are you aware of what impact that will have on the supply chain in the United States?

Are you aware that the rates of severe child abuse cases has gone way up due to children being cooped up with abusers?

Are you aware of the wealth transfer that’s occuring? Billionaires in the USA are $280 billion dollars richer since corona started.

The last time we saw an economic collapse of this magnitude, the next thing that happened was World War Two.

People are going to start losing their homes, their families, and their lives, in much greater numbers than the Corona.

Are you aware that between 50-75% of patients who end up on ventilators die anyways? Are you aware that most of the people dying are old and have severe conditions and short life expectancies already?

How many lives are we actually saving? And what is the quality of those lives ?

How many lives are we destroying? How much quality life years are being loss?

BPD,fiuihm9,t3_f9v4bn,1582742034.0,"My perception having lived with someone who has BPD for several years, is that they are often perceiving *something* but not necessarily a lie.  

For example, I can say I really care about someone and feel frustrated with them at the same time. Both things can be true, so when I say I really care and I’m currently feeling frustration, the person with BPD often takes that as “you hate me!” Which isn’t true! They are perceiving that my in the moment affect is not one of care towards them but one of frustration. 

So my in the moment emotional affect can differ from my overlaying care and value system, when these two are not congruent the person with BPD often gets triggered and thinks I’m “lying”. 

I think what often happens with BPD is they perceive things and then make up a really complex story that isn’t true! So yes they are perceiving an Incongruity  but the story they tell themselves about that incongruity in my experience is usually quite off! No I don’t hate you and want you to leave my life!"

spirituality,f5pyov9,t1_f5plr4l,1572369960.0,"My friend, the key is not in detachment, but in non-attachment. There is a big difference!

Non-attachment is to allow each and every experience to flow through you, to not judge society as good or bad, but to love things just as they are. The thing preventing you from experiencing bliss is your belief that things need to be different in order for you to do so. 

Our beliefs are built up as children, we projected our pure innocent love onto the world and as such we learned that we only got love if we behaved in a certain way. We bought into all of the programs and they still run in us. 

Ask yourself hard hard questions. How can you love a murderer? How can you love a thief? A rapist? Jesus loved all of these characters. Jesus prayed to God to forgive those who were crucifying him. 

I’m not saying Jesus is the only path by the way, he was just one of many enlightened beings to walk this beautiful earth.

Your post and it’s wording leads me to believe you are still at the stage of looking down on society as wrong or bad or evil or something like this. The rage you are experiencing directed at you is quite possibly a mirror of the anger/judgement you feel towards society. You use words like “society’s grasp” and “nothing has meaning”. I believe you are probably repressing or suppressing anger.

2. You are 100% right it’s deeper than not caring. It’s about realizing the beauty and perfection of all that is. It’s about loving all of it, every single grungey grimey part. Unconditional love means without condition. 

3. It isn’t the grasp of “society” that you are trying to break out of, it’s the delusions of your mind that keep you separate from experiencing the ground of freedom and bliss.

Libertarian,ew1a1jq,t1_ew074g1,1565018749.0,"I would say ignoring laws is bad advice. I’d say consider that the laws exist and be aware of them,  but if it comes down to breaking the law is a more loving/moral act then break it, but be aware that you are breaking it so you can find ways to avoid jail!"
Meditation,evdqb5e,t1_evcemp7,1564444703.0,"I agree, blaming period is illogical, because the truth is that it’s all connected. Indras net and all that. Blaming is not effective or true because causality doesn’t actually exist. There is no A causes B, it’s all context dependent, it’s part of the intricate net."
atheism,evaohy0,t1_evali3q,1564352985.0,I think you are coming from a place of thinking that an absolute eternal morality exists. I think it’s safe to say that human morality evolves and expands over time. I don’t believe an absolute morality exists.

Futurology,etpuhy4,t1_etpoama,1563064983.0,A large part of the math in Macroeconomics specifically is based on unfounded assumptions about human psychology. There is a whole subset of economics called behavioral economics that is based on human psychology. Economics is both math and psychology.
ChoosingBeggars,etlhvpz,t3_cc8btz,1562936873.0,"""Devils Advocate"" here, since when is asking rude? Can't people just say no? feel like asking should always be fine. People aren't obligated to give them money. Also, a lot of them seem to be honest about it, like hey will you support my trip? I can either be like ""sure thats cool!"" or ""no I want to spend my money on other things."" 

&#x200B;

A lot of the arguments on here are basically ""The begpackers should take individual responsibility!"" but then like why not turn that argument around on itself?  Why not make everyone else take individual responsibility in how they decide to hand out their money?"
GoldandBlack,etc998e,t1_et9qqoy,1562679048.0,"Ultimately all ideas are programming. In Buddhism there is a concept called “right view”. The main idea as I intrepret it is, “is my current viewpoint engendering greater love or compassion?” If it is then it’s “right view”. Otherwise I am holding it in such a way that is somehow damaging."
GoldandBlack,etc92gg,t1_et6fi5y,1562678900.0,"Here is the thing about economics, it’s based largely on human behavior. Human behavior is based in part on our instinctual nature, and in part on our beliefs. Strictly speaking one cannot be totally “right” about how economies work. Economies are dynamic in the same way people are, it is an evolutionary process. People’s beliefs and value systems are in a state of flux (now more than ever). Thus, how the economy “works” is in a state of flux. 

Furthermore, the left right dichotomy is sort of simplistic. It’s in fact I believe a dying axis, as can be seen with the rise of someone like Donald Trump. I think we need to be asking ourselves different questions. Are we acting in ways that both respect the individual and consider the whole? We are part of a larger ecosytem, one that is in fact dying. Both the parts and the whole matter. Left and right need to be scrapped, they are smoke and mirrors as far as I am concerned.

GoldandBlack,etc8ajw,t3_c9w1fg,1562678292.0,"I think the biggest problem with libertarians is how right they think they are. The level of pride I have seen amongst most of them is huge turnoff for most people. Most libertarians I have met have a hard time listening and just want to spout their ideology, which makes sense if you think about it, their ideology is all about the self and individual freedom.

 They come across as self absorbed because honestly the ideology attracts a lot of self absorbed people."
GoldandBlack,etc4sj3,t1_etabm4z,1562675308.0,"This is really black and white thinking and sort of a straw man argument. You are basically saying there are only two options here, which isn’t the case and the economy is way more complex than that. An increase in their wages could mean a decrease in profits for the owner, not necessarily a loss of the persons job. It could also mean a lot of other things.

Also though as far as where your money goes, you could choose to spend a little extra on a shirt where someone is paid better, you don’t need a bunch of super cheap shirts. I 

Also, if you take a look at how a lot of these situations came to be. You will see tons of disruptions to people’s ways of being and tons of “manifest destiny” type of shit where governments are intervening to support industry. 

The main problem with a total free market system is the accumulation of capital, which is the same as saying the accumulation of power. You ever heard the phrase it takes money to make money? Once capital/power starts accumulating, corruption sets in. 

Anyways, my main point that I want to drive home, is that if you are creating a black and white situation with an argument, then your argument is far too simplistic to accurately represent reality, and I notice libertarians do this a lot."
