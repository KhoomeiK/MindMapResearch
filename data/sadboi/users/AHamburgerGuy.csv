Something tells me this was the last interaction out of at least two.


Whether you think it's stupid to attack someone with a gun or not (and I would actually agree with you) that doesn't provide a solid legal defense. Think about it, can I just drive up to you while you walk down the street, flash a gun and make you fear for you life, and when you defend yourself I get to kill you? Is getting away with murder that easy? Just instigate the conflict and wait for a physical response?"

That sort of perception can easily seep into friendships, relationships, and work relations so that taller men gain their confidence through the validation from others. Other men respecting you and women being more likely to desire you can do that. 

Tom Cruise is short but cinematographers always attempt to portray him as taller in his films through forced perspective. He is also known to wear elevator shoes often - look at his photos with Katie Holmes. He isn’t exactly known for embracing his height, like most short actors.

I don’t understand what happened with the portal or why all the people would suddenly want to enter a world where the Nazis won the war. The multiverse subplot was cool at first but as the show progressed practically nothing came out of it. It was useful for the character development of Juliana but aside from that I don’t see how it benefited the plot. Yeah, they had the “Allies Win” tape but not much came out of that once they wrote it off as fake to the public when they kidnapped the titular character. It didn’t change Smith as a person, just radicalized him further (not that his journey there was needed to portray this radicalization). They (alt-world) didn’t help bring down the Nazis. There was no invasion. It felt like there were so many subplots injected in the fourth season that the importance of the portal was pushed to the side.

Wow, I guess I’m not actually NEET, I just leveraged my options in life in a way that allows me a near infinite amount of leisure time while I’m in school while still guaranteeing a high-paying finance job when I graduate. That’s what happens when you do life right, my man. But that’s alright, blame your whiteness as if it’s a handicap instead of a privilege, haha.

It’s funny because most successful whites agree with the notion of white privilege - it’s always the ones who failed to make something of themselves that feel like they don’t have it...what a surprise."

That’s ok man, your type makes me laugh. 37 y/o, never managed to accomplish anything in life despite being born into a fairly privileged family....lol. It’s always the most pathetic people in life that have these views. Sorry man, hating other people and having a victim complex isn’t going to make your life any better."
NEET,fc5vk9t,t1_fc5tfpr,1577466824.0,"What Asian prejudice? Wow, yet another under-educated buffoon that I schooled suddenly starts ranting on about bullshit that doesn’t make sense.

You asked how whites benefit from affirmative action and I gave you an answer. AA tends to apply to top schools and elite jobs - other places don’t need AA because they don’t have issues with representation. If you aren’t discussing school admissions or job applications then what the fuck would AA even do for anyone? Complete idiot you are, lol. 

That’s was TWO examples actually, and that wasn’t the goalpost. You asked how whites benefit from AA more than blacks or women and I told you exactly how. You were wrong, and I was right - you realize that, correct? Try to stay on the topic that YOU brought up, lmao. I see why you’re NEET bro."

The test score difference between Asians and whites is as big as  the gap between whites and Hispanics/blacks after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. So if Hispanics/blacks are displacing whites because of AA, then whites are displacing Asians at an even greater rate since most applicants to the best schools and most elite industries are Asian or white to begin with - thus making most spots a “competition” between mainly white and Asian applicants. Whites are more likely to be accepted than an equally qualified Asian, simply because they are white. 

That’s why Asians only account for 20-50% of the student body (elite schools) or workforce (elite industries) instead of what would be 70-90%+ if we lived in a true meritocracy - their test scores and credentials are just that much better than whites. Top-tier whites would only be able to compete with above-average Asians, not even close to top-tier Asians.

Again, most applicants to elite schools are Asian or white. Hispanics and blacks are under-represented virtually everywhere these metrics matter - meaning  1) schools/elite industries don’t actually lower their standards to let any minority in and 2) not enough qualified Hispanics/blacks are applying to these schools or jobs to allow for equal representation, let alone displacement of whites or Asians.

This means that the biggest beneficiaries of AA are whites. If it wasn’t for AA (among other privileges accompanied by whiteness), Asians would be in nearly every position of power, filling every seat of elite schools, and working in the most elite industries."
therewasanattempt,fc2sb5g,t1_fc2rcns,1577372585.0,"I think it’s a useless opinion because most of the time, just like you said, the character’s race and sexuality are irrelevant. Except that makes me say “oh, ok whatever” but it makes the oppressed gamers say “WOW! Why bother including it, then? FORCED diversity!!! Why do you hate white men?” 

The grievance doesn’t lie with the change, it lies with this false notion that this piece of media is a weapon in a broader culture war against the white man. Like, what the fuck are you even talking about? 


Each new depiction of Parker/SM creates a new universe in Marvel. They wouldn’t be suddenly making an established character gay, they’d be exploring one of the infinite amount of universes in the Marvel lore in which this particular Parker is gay, just like there is one where he is a talking pig and another where he was never born. 

I agree that established characters shouldn’t be changed via race, sexuality, or sex but I define established characters as, say, Peter Parker in the MCU right now. We are 3 movies in, he is established. Any new iteration of a Parker creates a new Marvel universe and therefore a new character. When you learn to look at the Marvel universe properly these sort of changes shouldn’t bother you because it’s just one out of the infinite amount of Marvel universes out there."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fc2rggc,t1_fc2pxbv,1577371862.0,"That’s a bad assumption. Just because a woman is ugly doesn’t mean she finds ugly men attractive and certainly doesn’t mean she has to settle with them. I think you just underestimate how many options that women, even the ugly ones, have when it comes to dating. 

It also brings another argument into the arena: if his self-proclaimed traits *are* true, should he *have* to settle with an ugly girl and not aspire for more just because he is ugly himself? Doesn’t that mean none of his accomplishments or personality traits really matter, and dating is really just dependent on physical looks?"
therewasanattempt,fc2qpim,t1_fc2qbz7,1577371209.0,"That’s the thing, you are so biased that you don’t even care for or know anything about the source material but still find yourself justified in your incorrect statements.

Marvel Comics has a universe where Spider-Man is a fucking bipedal talking pig. The idea of a universe with a gay Peter Parker is not even remotely outlandish, what the fuck do you even know dude?

Exactly, you “don’t care” but still feel the need to inject your unsubstantiated opinions on diversity on someone who is familiar with the source material or actual work being discussed. I’m sure you’re just an oppressed gamer buddy, I’m sorry about that but you lost. You will see more and more non-white gay portrayals in the future. Can’t stop this train but I look forward to taunting you losers as it occurs."
therewasanattempt,fc2q6r0,t1_fc2prly,1577370744.0,"Well, first off, you don’t know a thing about Parker or else you’d know that in the Ultimate rendition (source material) his relationship with MJ and Kitty aren’t really what define his character. MJ is just a generic damsel in distress most the time and could be switched with any woman that has a name, and the relationship with Kitty wasn’t very long. 

Second, yeah making Parker gay in the MCU now would not make sense since he has already been shown in 3 movies now as a straight guy. No shit, that’s not exactly a profound realization. 

This is not reality? It seems like you virgin reactionaries are bitching about a new black or gay or Asian character being included in something damn near every other week. It’s very much reality because I’ve been enjoying your bitch boy tears for the past 3 years now."
therewasanattempt,fc2ofak,t1_fc2medh,1577369093.0,"Oh, so basically “when I deem it natural and when I deem it forced.” Gotcha, that’s actually what I thought you meant. 

In this case, the MCU largely sources it’s material from the Ultimate Universe of Marvel which was a modern reinterpretation of classic superhero story arcs. It included such acts of appeasements to the SJWs (oh yeah, they were really active in the early 2000s.../s) like a black Nick Fury, a black Spider-Man, and a gay Colossus. The gay X-Men story arc was actually pretty big....back in the mid 2000s.

A gay Spider-Man would actually be consistent with the Ultimate Universe and its reinterpretations aka the source material for the MCU. 

So, knowing that the MCU is based off of the Ultimate Universe and that the Ultimate Universe has a history of reinventing established characters before social media even existed in its current state, how are you able to do distinguish? 

Something tells me you can’t. You see a black person in a piece of work and instinctively find a way to criticize their appearance - “forced diversity”. There is no natural diversity to you people.

I’m so happy you lost and this is reality now.

And no, your deliverance day is never coming. This is the new normal and that is not going to change. So sorry for you buddy but don’t worry, we’ll have a place for you in this new world."
