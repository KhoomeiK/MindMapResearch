offmychest,f8a9v1u,t1_f87szq2,1574391500.0,"This is really hard for me. My wife left me two months ago. I had hit rock bottom a few months prior. I started therapy and was slowly working my way back up. Then I found out how much the therapy was costing us, and knew we couldn't afford it. I had told her previously that I was jealous, that it wasn't fair she got to have therapy, when I needed it too, but her health plan covered a lot more than mine. I suggested I could make some progress on my own for a while, and switch my healthcare plans during open enrollment in October. She seemed to be on board with the plan, or at least said she was. I wasn't refusing to get help, but I think maybe she saw it that way. 

I was journalling daily, reaching out to friends, and my mood tracking was gradually showing improvements. I was doing better at work, even though I still had awful days. I was so proud of my baby steps, but worried that she had been getting more and more distant. I tried to share with her the stuff I was reading about healing from PTSD, and philosophical writing about the meaning of life that I felt was really helping me gain perspective and break me out of the depressive cycle. She complained that it didn't make sense to her, that she didn't understand the philosophy or how the books were helping at all. She got uncomfortable and defensive when I tried to talk about feelings, hers or mine. Her own mental wellbeing started declining, but I wasn't really in a place to help her. I mean I was improving, but... 

The night before she left was maybe the worst relapse in months. She crashed her car into a curb. I told her to call a tow truck and call me back. I texted and offered to come get her and help, but she didn't tell me where she was. It turned out she was three blocks away, but she called her dad from two cities away to come help her instead. I had a meltdown when she got back, when (in hindsight) she needed me to comfort her in a time of stress. I was beating myself up for not being there with her when she needed me, and felt like a failure. It must have been the last straw.

The next morning she left to go to her own therapy session. She told me ""I love you, see you in a couple hours"" and four hours later sent a text message, saying that she had moved out and wanted a divorce. She refuses to explain why, but I can only assume it's because of my issues, and her perceptions of where I was. I was honestly so proud of myself, and felt like I was finally getting somewhere -- right up until that moment. I'm crushed at losing her. She hasn't spoken to me since.

I already had abandonment issues, and my whole world feels like it has fallen down around me. I also now can't get new health insurance to try to get back into therapy. Since the divorce isn't final, she still shows up as my wife. I still can't afford it, and she refuses to give me the documentation I need to apply for government assistance.

I'm really struggling. And it's hurts so badly to be left like that. I wish she could have said something, anything, to let me know what she wanted, but she kept a lot of secrets from me that didn't come out until after she was gone. I still love her. It's just so hard to accept and move on."
