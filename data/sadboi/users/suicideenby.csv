Again minimum wage hasn't been enough to live on since before both if us were born so lets start there. With inflation it should be 25/hr in the US, and we're still fighting for 15. Goods & services still keep going up though so the people at the very bottom have been pushed into the streets just by inflation alone though often it's medical bills or medications as well.  Then the opioid companies pushed addictive drugs and created an epidemic of addicts. This increases crime which again increases homelessness and that just one sliver of this ugly puzzle you only have a few pieces of. 

Usually poor disabled people DO NOT have family to take care of them because they're all jerks to each other bc they're so poor or ill, and many suburban Americans especially are legally disabled and don't even know it, like my own parents. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you of any of this reality. You seem like you prob have a decent home and so can't imagine it. You prob shouldnt be anywhere on this platform except the teen forums if you're really that young. 

The refinery emits chemicals and gasses that get into the water and air and make people sick, sick people then make sick babies, it's genuinely not that complicated and happens all over the industrialized world.  Smoke and exhaust particulates can enter your bloodstream through your lungs and affect the blood vessels in the brain. Drinking them they enter the gut and may travel that way to the brain or other organs. 

Exhausts, or chemicals like PFAS, are what are called endocrine disruptors, they get into our body and mess up its ability to produce hormones properly (which is prob why all the trans people have messed up hormones, native Americans often slept right next to fires and that's likely why they acknowledged more genders, but it'll take decades, maybe even whole human lifetimes, for science to prove any of that, let alone the general public to accept it as fact). Hormone levels in the womb are also implicated in autism, which means we think that might be what causes it, but again, the science is still out for some years yet. 
Plastic is also an endocrine disruptor and we still eat and drink from it.  And that's just what these things do to our hormonal system, they probably also disrupt other bodily functions. 

And yeah, homeless people are just very unlucky, NOT lazy. I promise. Before bike helmet laws a lot of people were and still are very brain damaged. Young people with no head injuries have better working thinking/emotional management, but then have to live and try to cooperate w the older generation in charge that's always messed up by something else, including old attitudes. 

The world is way uglier than you can imagine yet, especially if they internet is the only place you're not sheltered. 

Lots of people feel entitled to both partners and kids and it's a genuine problem today, so It's great that you don't think you should have kids unless you can afford them, but what happens when you *can* afford them when they're born and then you lose your job because the govt doesn't manage a global crisis like it's supposed to? You end up homeless with kids then.  And that's millions of Americans right now and about to be more. We're in another depression and it may be the rest of your teenhood or more before we're out of it again.   Very sorry you've been growing up in the world you are, but I've no doubt with some education you could help to improve it. You seem like someone that cares.

If you can sneak in ways for her to automatically think highly of herself when she thinks to reach out to you, you may even be able to help when she can't get ahold of you. 

Essentially this is what therapists do with Sucidal Ideations.  They teach you to interrupt the SI when it happens with other positive thoughts. It's like training a dog not to shit on the carpet except the dog is your thoughts, the carpet is your memory and the shit are the ideations. And just like with dogs, it helps to be consistent with intrusive or obsessive thoughts. The more she interrupts the thoughts the less power they have. 

Repeatedly reinforcing songs or memories/thoughts that make her happy every time no matter what (we all have these little dopamine triggers locked away in our memories) whenever she's feeling like ending it could help. Again especially reminding her of times she was a great person and did fun or good things. These memories are IMPOSSIBLE to access when battling ideations. It's like they're not even there. They are, they're just buried. 

I'm not a therapist and every coping mechanism has a shelf life/half-life depending on if it's useful or toxic, so keep that in mind. But distraction, asking about or reinforcing positive moments in her life, and sometimes focusing on future goals (for me its live music and events) can help.

Make plans so you don't make plans has been my new ideation survival mantra. The thoughts are still always randomly there, but then so are the future plans to deter the follow through.

Another good coping mechanism for spending time alone is KNOWING how to get yourself outside of your own head and into the moment. Meditation is just being aware of your current reality above thinking about the past or future (both REALLY common ideation triggers). Stuff like people watching counts as long as you're thinking about nothing else not even how dumb that hat is. But maybe for you, you hyper focus on cleaning grout. Whatever works.

EatCheapAndHealthy,fi3yc57,t3_f5zmk1,1582130213.0,"If you can't manage whole meals for yourself, figure out where your food banks and occupy/anarchist community are serving community food (Ocpy tend to be city central and healthier than the church food banks, but also be more like a spaghetti dinner you have to get to at a specific time. If you can't find one here on Reddit somewhere just reach out to a local Food Not Bombs or any Occupy chapter and they can prob direct you to your local free nondenominational food) and honestly get over and get good at stealing some food. Not even going to lie. I lived mostly on shortbread cookies, just because its a shitload of calories not at all healthy, pb + bananas, apples + cheese, knicked meal bars or drinks, and whatever green stuff I could pocket, beg, or buy. Bag salads are good for right then and can be eaten with one plastic fork right out of the bag. Cheaper than a fast food salad and usually more filling, better if you can cup o soup w it from a gas station or even better buy a hot cup from like Tim Hortons or a diner. This was a treat when I could manage it though because it's still like $5/6 all together, but that $6 goes just a little further than a #6 combo. Soup is honestly one of the better ways to get lots of nutrients in one meal.  Just eggs + toast is another super cheap combo that most diners will make for $2-4. Diner eggs and toast are better than $2 egg McMuffin. It shouldn't be that way, but it is somehow. Street style tacos are also always dirt cheap, even from restaurants, and usually better than fast food if you are lucky enough to have real Hispanic food anywhere in your area. 

If someone turns you in for stealing groceries look them straight in the face and ask them where the fuck they shelved their humanity while they were stocking groceries. Ain't no one going to stop you unless you are hella overt about it, *look* like a scary criminal or someone that obviously needs help. And just don't hit the same stores over and over. Keep it moving. I didn't realize this at first and lost like 30lbs before I said fuck this and just started taking apples, granola bars, n cucumbers from somewhere. 

It sounds like you can tell that the food you get to consume, especially when homeless, really impacts how well you can function. Pb + apples, pb + crackers, crackers and cheese when you can get it cheap, are all much better snackmeals than fries. Pretend you're a toddler you have to feed and it's a little easier.

Hare krishnas also do a once a week veg meal for donations. They were my favorite to accept hot food from, but also the oddest, just don't get sucked in. 

If you can clean up at a gym or friends house and get to the nearest aiport, change into business or business casual clothes with the cleanest bag you have, and do rounds at baggage claim/arrivals claiming to have lost your wallet on your trip and you're just trying to get a few bucks for dinner. If you smell like a street person or harass too many people they'll boot you, but if you seem clean and genuine you should be able to net a few decent bills and possibly even a meal. Bathrooms are a good place to both get caught harassing people bc someone told security and also not get caught at all bc security isn't in there. Again your guts here are everything. 
(parking or getting in without looking suspicious or noticeable is the hardest part, I liked to park at a hotel and use their shuttles but without a hotel key they can be shitty, just depends on the driver/how busy it is, I eventually had a nice one that recognized me and either knew what was up or just thought I was a normal business traveller ""back again this week?! Haha Yep!"") I mention all this because for me, the airport was the place a random bored stranger on a long ass layover or just getting home from vacay was often willing to buy me a whole ass meal just for a chat and might have been the only one I had in several days (and there was wifi). I suspect some employees eventually had to be able to tell something was up w me, but they might have also just thought I was a strung out project manager. I'll never know, but I'm not homeless rn, and know it's sad as hell we have to trick anyone into helping us eat. 

Good luck, street people everywhere. Stay fed.

I was raised agnostic inside a Presbyterian family, and quickly recognized that atheism is the only sane concept when it comes to sky daddies that can hear our thoughts. This is important for understanding how physically ill I am when this happens. 

Fast forward to I'm in my late thirties, recovering from alcoholism mostly alone because everyone still thinks like drug war soldiers instead of harm reductionists, and I'm both autistic and bipolar and in the worst physical shape of my life. I discovered during this period that your typical rocking, kneeling, desperate ""prayer position"" (i always see documentary footage of groups of people in SE Asia praying when I think about it, which tbf could be the reason *my* autistic ass does this) is apparently just something my autistic ass does in a state of extreme physical duress (clasping hands feels like holding another person's hand and clasping them to your chest simulates hugging, from a perspective of evolutionary psychology it makes total sense). 

So I'm in this completely desperate physical and mental state, alone, suddenly ""praying"" for help, experiencing dimentia symptoms moving in loops and not recalling anything, and I'm having what is a legit ""manic panic"" one random weekday morning, my state is such that my anxiety is through tf roof and I'm speaking and thinking rapidly about nothing and nothing good to exactly no one. I'm talking and walking around in circles in my apartment like a textbook mental case. Stimming, flapping, ranting, crying, unwashed, naked except for socks and underwear, the kind of shit people win Oscars for mimicking. 

I'm panicking and desperate to understand why I can't ever do anything like I'm supposed to, pretty typical self loathing meltdown for me just cranked up to eleven by my physical state, etc. ""I can't understand, I'm the worst person ever, I'll never get well, why are tptb all sadistic twisted narcissistic dickbags?! I should write a medium article about it, that'll show them!'"" kind of nutjob thinking. 

All of a sudden I see this angelic figure like a ball of bright light with arcs of light as wings hovering above me and just off to the side a bit, I look around and the arcs move crazily with my vision and for a breif moment in spacetime I bought into the woo and I asked this apparition, out loud, for realz, ""are you an angel?! Can you help me?!""

When it didn't answer because my diagnoses thankfully don't include voices, and I realized it was going anywhere my eyes went, at which point I recognized that I'd just had a fucking seizure for the first time in my life. 

It took me split seconds to work out I'd just had a minor seizure and the next time I saw my doc I stepped down off that med, and in retrospect was likely just being overdosed a very incorrect medication.

AskPsychiatry,fh2ktgh,t1_fh2eins,1581256380.0,"As much as treating people y'all know you already hate? Because I swear to all that is holy to anyone, the next professional that treats me with open fkn disdain for any reason, I guess I get to sue for just that.

It's already awful business. Can you imagine if it was easier for the people being treated to sue? There wouldn't be any professionals left at that point, I suppose. 

I have problems talking to doctors at all because so many have physically and emotionally abused me as just an autistic since I was a child in the 80s. 

My peers can't help me, and neither can professionals, but I'm supposed to just keep hanging on to hope, for what? 

My point is that the chronically mentally ill are already flat out abused just by having to reteach each professional who we are, ourselves. It would be MUCH easier for me to have a profile on a secured site they could go learn my actual history from and any bits of it I contest because the Dr and I didn't communicate effectively with one another. It would also help me if that same site functioned as a matchmaking site for me. I would move to be near any atheist that loves Dr Sacks and was willing and able to treat me. For real. It's that dire. 

Telling chronically mentally ill people they are in charge of their mental health for their whole life themselves is pretty gd fucked. 

It's difficult to maintain ambulances too, but we do that because it's necessary. This imo, is equally necessary."
