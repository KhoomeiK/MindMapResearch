Couple of days ago another brand whom I just become a supplier to asked me if we could partner up and merge our businesses. He did this because he could see all the skills I have and how he could utilise it to improve his brand. Money could have been good, but by doing so I would have just killed my brand in the process. 

People show interest because they see potential in you, it should be other way around. They should be able to convince you that they can solve some problems within your business.

2. Cheers!

I am getting an office because I want to hire some people, and get that experience/responsibility/seriousness owning a business. I've been operating from my room/office/bedroom floor for over 4 years - I wake up in front of the computer it's just a tiny space with loads of boxes and shelves. Did this while I was working full time, so didn't really need an office space. But, I fell in to really bad habits and depression due to some tragic events in my family. Recently my sister suggested that it would good if I plan to get an office space so I can get out of the house. She's right, if I can get in to a routine of ""going to work"" it'll help I think. 

This is what brought me to think about getting an office space. I think if I can get someone to handle part of my work, I can spend my time on other things. I also wanted to hire someone so I am not locked down to one place, take care of things when I am not around.

If you don't need to have a office space, and if you can still work from your basement/garage. Just stick to it till you ""must"" have a office business place. This is my personal opinion."

Entrepreneur,fc2f82u,t1_fc0zppu,1577356774.0,"1. Well I was too naive and too young to know anything better. People I reached out to, thought who could mentor me were interested in my business in the early stages. But I never got a single penny from them nor any help. All they did was to show me how difficult to get a task done (in paper), but all it took me was to make few phone calls and figure shit on my own. Stop believing what people say, that's what I learnt from the so called startup-experts/ or angel investors. I probably got served a bad card, but I am not willing to risk it again with these silly things.
2. Friends - early stages of startup, you would want to hire your friends or partner up with them. This is what most of the articles/guides would say. Me being a nice guy - I expected good from my friends. I thought I'd get my closest friends involved and help them out,.   
\- I had one guy who just stole my idea. Started his own business and ditched me. He's doing pretty well, but he still lies to my face saying it's a client project that he got. I let it slide, I just pretend I don't know.  
\- Had another friend in the business as a partner, was with me for 2 years. He just got too distracted with his own problems and money became the priority. He'd do a half-ass job and ask me to do the rest when I point things out. Got to a point I just couldn't deal with it, and it was easier for me to do things on my own then getting him to do it. So yeah, he'll be out of the picture in few months.
3. People who think life is about partying and drugs. No seriously, I had a startup that I closed down in 3 months. I loved the fact that I can talk about business problems and close deals. This is the last set of skills I taught myself working at an ad agency. I quit my job to join with few talented people in my network. I closed 4 clients without even an office space or the business name. Funded all what we need using the first month's pay. Unfortunately 2 out of 4 partners were too busy, smoking too much shit or popping pills - didn't see this coming till it was too late. They spent all the money for weed, pills or partying. I had to call it quits when we lost few clients and had no money to pay the people whom they had hired. The team was too busy fucking things up and planning orgies. All they wanted was me to make money so they can party.

I am pretty good at recovering from worse case scenarios and planning out the future. This year (2019) was by far the worse, too many lessons in a short period of time.  I kinda foresaw all these things, and had contingency plans as a backup. I most definitely lost few people on this journey. You live and you learn."

tip 1: Reading, writing, audiobooks - all of these have helped me throughout. I started with listening to audio books. 

tip 2: I used to have a punching bag in my room, it helped me with dealing with pain and negative thoughts. I just work the bag till I can't anymore. Then just crash... For the past  few months I had no access to it, thanks to some construction work at my place. The other day I was at a really bad place, so I just punched myself in the head so I can shake off the thoughts and fall asleep. I eventually did, dunno if its because of the hits or just I was tired.

bonus tip: Sleeping helps, you just have to do something till you feel tired and fall asleep. I read somewhere there are two ways you can shut your thoughts, one is by death the other is by getting some damn sleep. Have a good one!"
Entrepreneur,fbzzryb,t1_fbzyhgn,1577270788.0,"1. Well if you could pay for the loan, without getting sucked up in to debt go for it. Spend wisely. If I was going to start another venture I will just play it safe, start with what I have or what I make. Really don't like the idea of being in debt. 

2. Yup. I am actually in the process of getting a small office space in the near future so I can hire an assistant. For the money I will pitch in from both of my businesses. For the past ten years all I did was train people to do my work. So I am pretty confident when it comes to doing that part. 

Hiring someone is really important. But plan how you will do it. Like training, introduction to the business, paper work, HR etc... I think it would work out because by doing so you can spend your time in more important areas of the business. This will help you get some load off from your side as well. Plus the responsibility of having someone will help you be more serious about your venture. Find someone with the passion to learn not for what they are on paper. I am planning on getting paid interns who interested in marketing as a career or just some kid with a clean slate."

I played it safe and just dropped them a mail asking for reference. So they just turned around and hired me. Worked 2 out of 2.

Try to find small but enough to sustain retainers and make sure they are happy. Where I come from I don't need to make thousands of dollars to survive. So as a consultant you should be able to provide not so expensive but quality service."
Entrepreneur,fbzmc5g,t3_efaxaa,1577251622.0,"I started two businesses on my own with nothing. One is a consultancy business, and the other is a ecommerce + manufacturing company.

I worked as a marketing executive from 20, when I had an idea what I needed to do for the ecommerce/manufacturing business I invested with salary. I didn't save much but I managed to get few credit cards and a personal loan to pay for these along the way. Skip 4 years, now I have a operational business with two retail store deals.

I quit my job early this year and started on my own as a marketing consultant. Secured two clients so I can pay my bills and focus more on the business.

If I could go back and change things I would have quit my job earlier and stopped looking for people to join me on the venture. You see, when you are an entrepreneur you need to realise that you are alone. You will be for a long time. Stop trying to find help or partners in early stages. Just do things on your own with what you have. I ditched everyone who latched on to me. There are tough decisions you need to take.

Edit: toughest parts where when I was in debt, had no money to pay my bills, plus when I realised all the people around me were just there for the money or to fill their void. So yeah ditching them and focusing on myself was pretty tough. Mental health is really important as well, if you can get professional help. Pay someone to listen to you and get constructive feedback. Not a friend, nor a gf/bf. A professional therapist.

I had some ideas which I thought I;d execute, one of them were to start my own mens grooming brand. I was never good at saving money, but then again I didn't make that much. So I saved up a little, took some credit cards, and personal loans along the way to fund this venture. I spoke to few close friends, and only 1 stuck around. I had no clue how to do things when it comes to business so I reached out to people whom I used to work with. Though they initially was super excited about the venture, they later had other commitments to spend the money in. Which not only slowed things out for me, but added to my expenses. All these things I did while I was working a full-time job, luckily I ended up at an Australian company with early shifts. So I had enough time to finish up at work and make sure I spent enough time on developing products. 

My business partner did help me with the website and some financial expenses but I had to run the business in all other ends. Since I wanted to make our own products, I spent quite a bit of our budgets in RnD and finding sources. It was a good learning curve and I surly enjoyed every bit of it. 

Early this year, I quit my job to focus oaths business and few other things. But it didn't pan out very well for me. So I ditched the new venture and stuck to what I knew. All these years I was telling myself I;d quit working for a company at the age of 30. As I wanted at the age of 30 (will be 31 in few months). I am working as a consultant with 2 retainers and running my business which I started 4 years ago as a hobby. If I could change things any way, I'd tell myself that I could do things on my own.
