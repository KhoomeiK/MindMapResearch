So I'll definitely look in the recommended products section for protein-packed products (love alliterations, omg).

Do you know why the Palmer's Protein Masque would not have a positive effect? Is it due to the coconut like the Cantu products? I thought coconut was good for hair!

I saw some scalp. Lil upset my hair isn't as thick as I thought haha. The other test said to hold a strand between your fingers and if you feel it, you have thick hair and if you don't you have thin hair (????). I feel it when I touch it but if I hold it I no longer feel it?? I don't know if I'm doing this one right.

I also have red hair which I've heard often looks thicker than it is, is that something you have heard?

Products:

Cantu Shea Butter Sulfate-free Cream Conditioner every other night. Used to use do it every night (but with Palmer's Coconut Repairing Conditioner, again, felt little to no difference as with their masque) but I felt it made my hair dryer. When I condition I squeeze most water out, squish to condish, then put in bun for rest of shower.

As I Am Coconut Co-wash once a month at most for when my hair feels extra greasy or gunked up.

After shower I know use raw shea butter on the ends/shafts.

Deep treatment masque every couple weeks. Was the Palmer's for a long time and now Shea Moisture's Manuka Honey Masque.

It's a simple and sad routine, haha. I've tried so many products and oils and stuff over the years and man, I can't get this under control. The dry and frizziness is getting to me now."

xxfitness,foif6fy,t3_g7i0qy,1587785227.0,"What a great idea for a workout!

I have zero rythym and used to be terrified to dance in public, and felt silly even dancing by myself at times. My boyfriend on the other hand, *killer* dancer (huge white guy as well, you'd never guess, haha). We've gone to shows and festivals and I got sick of the anxiety and said ""Fuck it, I wanna dance"" and after a few of those (very) anxiety-provoking ""fuck its,"" the anxiety lessened drastically. I suck at dancing! I look like a fool! But I have fun! No one cares. If you ever go to a music event, look around, most people aren't even looking at others, they're doing their own thing. That whole ""dance like no one's watching"" quote doesn't sound so cheesy once you're able to do it. But really, *no one cares.* Would you look at someone dancing silly and think ""Oof, they look stupid"" or would you think ""They look like they're having fun!""

If you wiggle instead of twerking or shimmying, join the club, girl. That can be *your* twerk! *Your* shimmy! The more you put yourself out there and let yourself be uncomfortable (and you will feel incredibly uncomfortable), you start to realize how much pressure and judgement you've put on yourself, how much time that has only wasted and stolen joy.

So it sounds simple, but it won't feel like it. But keep going! I used to have severe social anxiety and let me tell you if I wanna dance now, I fucking dance! You'll get there. Maybe try different styles of dance workouts, wearing clothes that make you feel more confident, look in the mirror when you do it or maybe not. Find something that works for you and build from there.

So from one hella white girl with zero rythym to another, you got this! Go kick ass and break a sweat. Enjoy your young self and appreciate how your body can move now because it won't always be able to. Own that wiggle twerk!"

Although, over the past few days I have limited music/TV/etc for most of the day to get used to silence and being with my own thoughts. It's almost addicting now, but I think it's easier to be in silence *while* I am moving.

I have had a couple 'sessions' that have helped make my days more peaceful but like you said, it will come more with time. Wow, I almost feel silly for not realizing the refocusing as the exercise. Suppose I just needed someone to point that out.

I do sessions ranging from 5 to 15 minutes usually. Shorter ones, obviously, are easier. Focusing on sensations is a great tip. I'm currently having some issues with body pain so maybe the sensation of massaging the painful areas for relief would be something to focus on.

I knew someone who also had it on their butt and back of thighs closer to the butt. Head and Shoulders has worked for a lot of people, I hear! As well as Nizoral, another anti-dandruff shampoo. I have tried Nizoral but used it incorrectly (it has to sit on your skin for at least a minute. I just washed it off like regular face wash). I'm going to pick some up soon and hope for the best. I guess the ingredient that treats the yeast is called ketoconazole. I also recently learned anti-fungal oral medications like flucanozole (usually used when us ladies get yeast infections) can clear it up *a lot.* It can be ordered online so I'm gonna do some more research into it and possibly order it. Maybe it could work for you! Although I'm not sure if there would be an issue with expanding your fam like Spiro would cause.

I have been through similar (I was 15, he was 20) and it wasn't until a few months ago (we have been broken up for 4 years, together for about 4) I truly realized how perverted this man was. He continues to stalk me to this day and it has recently brought up a lot of scary thoughts and memories in regards to sex.

I wish I could offer good advice, but all I can really say is you CAN scream and yell and cry. You are allowed to feel your feelings. They are uncomfortable and maybe scary but they are there, they are valid, and unfortunately we must often feel these things in order to recover from the things that triggered them to begin with.

Do you have a therapist? Maybe there are support groups in your area for 'people like us.' Practice taking care of and loving yourself. You deserve peace.

I would also suggest not following or looking him up (or his GF) online. Block him/them. It becomes easier the more you distance yourself from them and the relationship.

Personally, I have deleted all of my pictures, accounts, as much personal info as I can from the internet due to his stalking nature. Is this an issue for you at all? Does he attempt to contact you?

Psychosis,flnauo6,t1_flm9ouq,1585314236.0,"Yup, so there's the ""recurrent"" part; it comes and goes. I'm really sorry to hear you're feeling this way now. It's not easy, but we gotta keep going. There is a lot of confusion and fear that comes along with mental illness, remember there are subs like this out there and there are wonderful people in the (real) world who would love to help and support you. Keep kickin' ass, asking questions, and just doing your best."
Psychosis,flm8tjt,t1_flm7gnb,1585277322.0,"""Recurrent"" means happening often/repeatedly. Like a ""recurring dream"" is a dream that is experienced over and over.

Psychosis,flm5io9,t3_fpnl39,1585275061.0,"MDD is major depressive disorder.

SchizophreniaArtProj,flgtz1k,t3_fon5ij,1585150269.0,"Oh shoot, I do this a lot, especially when I'm not doing too well. There is something about the sharp lines and the mixing of different ""blocky"" shapes. And pages of lines and lines and lines.

Do you ever find yourself suddenly doodling these for seemingly no reason? It's become almost an automatic coping skill in a way. It's satisfying to my brain, if that makes sense."
