I do need some advice however..I'm a backend developer but I still have to do the frontend for my side projects and I haven't used any frontend framework yet (either plain html/css or ejs). I want to learn a frontend framework/library that isn't too complicated or won't take a lot more time than the backend. So which of Vue, React and Angular suits me best in your opinion?

haiku,fmhldwo,t3_er4fcz,1586084993.0,"I don't want to say this in a separate post in case it violates some rules so I'll ask here. I learned that a Haiku follows the 5-7-5 syllable structure but it's not wrong either to use any other structure, i get that.

My problem is what can be considered a haiku and what not..shouldn't the first line **always** talk about the setting then the second line about the subject then finally an action done by or to the subject?

I see a lot of Haiku on this sub and I don't know if it really counts as a Haiku or not.

Like this one for example which belongs to the user ""Crinchy"":  is this the real life / or is this just fantasy / it's Bohemia.

How is this a Haiku exactly?

Or ""foxofok""'s one for example: First they said no masks / Now they say to wear a mask / I donâ€™t own a mask.

I'm pretty confused"
webdev,fldfjr0,t3_fno0br,1585063515.0,"UPDATE (PROBLEM SOLVED): I'll write here what solved it for me in case someone searches for this problem in the future doesn't get stuck like me.

&#x200B;

I kept researching and found out that Twitter and LinkedIn check their links against a database of ""bad"" domains called ""Spamhaus"". So I checked there via [this link](https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup/) and indeed I found that my website is blacklisted but I still didn't know why but at least I knew what the problem was. First off, Spamhaus offers to manually whitelist your domain for free if you provided a non-freemail email (i.e: no gmail, hotmail...etc.), and luckily I had my college email and it worked, it took about 30 minutes and my domain is no longer blacklisted.

But this isn't a solution it's just a temporary fix (it would be blacklisted eventually if i dont change something) so I kept looking and found this great article and I discovered that the security HTTP headers were NOT set for my website through Netlify, and this is actually strange because I thought this was something automatically handled by them. Anyway I just had to set the security headers in the `netlify.toml` file and then I was finally able to post my URL on both Twitter and LinkedIn!

The article that helped me: [https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/04/11/site-security-cloudflare-netlify](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/04/11/site-security-cloudflare-netlify)

`worker: python app.py`

I normally connect my GitHub to Heroku, watch as every module gets built and then the build succeeds. What should happen is that [`app.py`](https://app.py) should be invoked as soon as the build finishes because I specified that in the Procfile (right?). Instead, nothing happens, I check Heroku's log and it says that the worker changed state from starting to up. This should mean that the command in the Procfile should've been executed by now but that's not what happens.

I have to manually disable then enable the worker from Heroku's dashboard (or scale to 0 then rescale to 1 from the CLI) which will lead to the same log output as before but this time the code is actually running. That's the only part I can't understand.

How to link domains from Godaddy to heroku: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKGSGT7mSnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKGSGT7mSnQ)

Now there was a link explaining some problems with linking Cloudflare to Heroku but I can't find it but I can still remember the important parts: 

If you ever get to the point of configuring Cloudlfare. In the ""DNS"" section, make sure to link your root and www domains to [**yourname.herokuapp.com**](https://yourname.herokuapp.com) and not to the CDN address Heroku gives you when you add a custom domain there. And then in the ""Crypto"" section make sure that you turn on ""force HTTPS"" and set it to ""Full encryption"" and not ""Flexible."
generative,evaio3a,t3_cj0w4t,1564348665.0,"I haven't done it myself yet but I know some options.

If your website is just a portfolio with no backend logic or heavy programming (just a way to display your art, that's what a static website is), look for github pages. You get free hosting but iirc your website will look like this ([yourname.github.io](https://yourname.github.io)). Another free alternative that lets you buy custom names is Netlify, I've only heard good things about it.

&#x200B;

But if your website involves payment or any form of backend programming then the cheapest solution is Heroku. Sign up for a free-tier account. You get 1k free hours or dynos (their currency or whatever) per month. People calculated it and it turned out that if your account only has this website then it can be up 24/7 without using all of your free dynos. Heroku's free tier puts your website to sleep by default after 30 minutes of inactivity but you can easily work around it by using service like [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com) . You can set it to ping your heroku website every 5 minutes and so your website will be active 24/7.

&#x200B;

Oh and Heroku can do static websites pretty well too but it would be overkill. your heroku website will look like this ([yourname.herokuapp.com](https://yourname.herokuapp.com)) but you can always buy a custom domain and link it to heroku for free (they only need your credit card info for verification. no payment needed). And regarding SSL, if you really need this green lock to appear on your customers browsers, Heroku offers SSL but not for free. Instead of that you can use Cloudflare with Heroku, they give free SSL certificates.

&#x200B;

Either way, you'll get a running website completely for free unless you want to add your own name but it should be pretty cheap like $3\~$5 per year.

I'll reply with some links with more details shortly."

I can go with that but I won't actually like using their service; I will go to the first alternative with no ads.

&#x200B;

I can imagine it like that: Yesterday you ate pizza. Today you want to buy a TV. So you go to the store, find yourself one of the employees and ask him about good TVs and he does help you and you end up buying a TV.

BUT, most websites don't have any settings that let you tweak the kind of ads that you get.. for example, I've been eyeballing a certain product on amazon that I wouldn't like anyone to know about for different reasons. Then I have to do a slideshow or share my screen with other people. It would be pretty embarrassing if that product just keeps showing up on other websites and people now know what secret product I'm interested in. It's just like forcibly sharing your browser history.

&#x200B;

For me it was just a guitar, maybe for other people it was a dildo, sex doll or whatever product that's not appropriate in a professional manner.
