We live in this duplex, its okay for a small family or roommates (it has two rooms, one for me, an only child, and another for my parents). 
It happened when I was a junior in highschool, my mom woke up before me and she saw a dark figure in the living room. She thought it was me and when she turned on the lights, it was gone. When she told me about it, me being a paranormal junkie, told her she might be seeing shadow people or something, or maybe she was half awake and was just seeing things, its very common in my family that we all have issues with sleep (I have insomnia and my mom and brother get sleep paralysis). Maybe about months later we decided to move somewhere else and my mom's friend decided to take the duplex (we don't own it, we rent it). 

Same thing happened to her, she saw a dark figure, except it was outside. 

Spooky shet out here man."
AskReddit,forff2f,t3_g90325,1588011308.0,"The area I live in has a lot of brats roaming around. Mostly they're from young and single moms who aren't fit to be moms by the way they let their kids go on and about. 

I witnessed a kid throwing tantrums and knocking things down at a local grocery store, the mom just standing there doing nothing. I worked at a thrift shop, and I had so many kids in the toys section with no adult supervision, gets all mad when me and other workers tell them to go back to their parents. 

A more recent one is this woman my mom recently befriended. She sleeps around, all her five kids and current baby in the oven have different fathers. One of them, a girl who is around 13, I hate with a passion. She bullies and abuses her younger sisters, disrespectful to everyone, goes into anyone's bedroom without permission and start messing with their stuff (I was visiting a friend who's parents are friends with my mom and the girl's mom, we caught her in my friend's room trying on her clothes and shoes without any permission). The younger kids are tolerable, but when they want something they ask their mom rather than say my mom or whoever they were visiting. The mom is the worse too, she uses her kids as sympathy objects and does nothing to discipline any of them. She questioned why I don't let her girls in my room, and I straight told her that one of her daughters have a nasty attitude and I don't want her stealing my stuff (which got her mad)."

My mom is also the type to talk about my therapies and issues at school. 

And it's toxic enough that she thinks I don't know trauma because she ""been through worst"" (and she has gone through hell in her childhood, teenhood, and adulthood).

My mom would just dismiss my troubles and just say have faith in God. Not to be mean to anyone who's religious, but that phrase means nothing to me and it doesn't help."
SuicideWatch,ffgzijg,t3_etia6b,1579919088.0,"Same goes to school counselors. They sent me to an organization specialized in ""troubled youth"". First time was because of bullying and being suicidal, second time was just a plain old panic attack. 
I was sent to another organization dealing with domestic violence survivors (my father abused me and my mother-) 

My therapists were nice, and while some of their methods works for a time, I grew bored in our sessions. It felt like they're repeating themselves. 

And years later now, I graduated and now I'm willingly going to seek mental help because I was never diagnosed in my time of school and my mental state is getting worse (I was never ""normal"" since childhood, I had signs that I may have ADHD, but my parents don't believe in mental health).
I actually went to see professional help after having another breakdown and self harmed myself. When I went to seek help, my mind is set to get help, not suicidal mode. This woman asked if I wanted to go to the ward for a few days or take medications, which I told her I can't do medications in fear I might overdose like I did in the past. I was suppose to do a psych exam to know what the hell is wrong with my brain and why I am getting worse, she told me they couldn't unless I agree to take medications. 

Its been months since then and I don't know how to get help."

Its strange because my friend does not like my boyfriend, like at all. I guess she just thought he makes me happy (which in the beginning, sure. But not sure right now). 
Even she gets irritated with his behavior, she tries to give him advice on about sex and how to be more romantic etc. Of course, he never takes them smh."

My best friend does play a part in this though, she thinks that we're meant to be and just have to talk through our problems. My other close friend, he disagrees and told me that it won't get any better, but he still supports me in my decisions. The argument was over on the phone and he was there with me quietly listening. My friend wanted to beat my bf up with all the things he said smh. 

Overall our relationship is complicated and I have thought of breaking up with him. Though my bff keeps telling me that we both just need to talk, but I know him and how he is, and he didn't his lesson. Idk she wants us to try and rekindle our relationship, I dunno if that's going to work."
relationships,fdw4b15,t1_fdvznmx,1578754866.0,"I've been in therapy before, mostly cause my schools forced me to go (in middle school, a teacher found my suicide poems over my bullying and home life, and in highschool I had a panic attack and literally the school put me back in the same program I went in middle school). 

In my time of being in the therapy around my junior year, I went to another organization that was specifically for domestic survivors and their families. My father verbally abused both me and my mom, though he physically abused my mom more. In that I met a therapist that had a one on one with me as a group therapy didn't really got me engaged. That's where I told her about my relationships, both from my parents, my friends, and romantic. And I do still love my dad, even after everything he done to me and my mom, but I don't want him to be in my life. And I still talk to my dad, he's in another country at the moment. My therapist thinks because I still hold on to my dad, no matter how much he puts me through, I would do the same with my other relationships. But at the time, I didn't realize how many of my relationships were toxic, and how it affects me today. For example, when I was 12 I dated my first boyfriend for a couple of weeks or a month idk. He was 16, so that was a red flag, and he didn't want my parents to find out. He tried to pressure me into sex, though after a while I rejected and broke up with him. Now grown up, I felt disgusted looking back. 

Now that I'm 19, I feel like my mental health has gotten worse. This time, I actually want to see a therapist on my own will, my mom doesn't have control on me over what I say to my therapists (she was a paranoid woman, she didn't want me to be completely honest and open to anyone). 
Though in order to finally get a psych evaluation supposedly in the city I live in, I have to agree on taking medications (I hate pills and I told them that I had a history with overdosing, especially nowadays all I could think about is death). So now, idk what I have and idk if I'm gonna try again."

Turn off thing is he doesn't really does any work to get me on board like making out or kissing my neck or anything. And he wants to top, something I doubt he can do.

I have a bad habit of giving people another chance in relationships, which is something I got to break. 

He's stubborn as hell for a soft guy. Normally he's a nervous wreck who says the wrong things around people, my friends questioned how I even like him. He gets so nervous when he tries to seduce me, which I try to calm him down about it. His insecurities gets the best of him a lot, though."

Coming from an abusive household, these types of parents expect that you will take care of them regardless of how they treat you, guilt you with ""Oh you're gonna leave me when you're older"" or ""Oh you're gonna drop me off at a old people's home"". My dad is a mooch, and once I start having a steady career, he'll quit working and live under my checks. He would brainwash me as a child that it was going to be my responsibility to take care of him and all of his troubles. It honestly fucked me up when I came to the realization that my dad is only around for financial benefits.
