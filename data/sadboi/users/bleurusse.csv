piercing,fl8yfnt,t1_fl8wiof,1584935580.0,i checked and you’re right they’re not gold gold. they’re gold plated stainless steel. im not sure how much of a difference that makes though if you can tell me? i think the originals were 9/16 and these ones are 1/2 but when i first changed it they were fine and the hoop didn’t seem too small but i think the irritation has made them a little more swollen
piercing,fl8xkyd,t1_fl8wtrn,1584934922.0,they’re both 14g
piercing,fl8wk66,t1_fl8w7dc,1584934144.0,i just took it out to put the barbells back in but i can’t get it into the piercing hole. it seems like it’s closing but i dont know how it would do that with a ring in it
piercing,fl8w4cq,t1_fl8w280,1584933821.0,i wanted to but im worried im gonna irritate it even more by changing it back
piercing,fl8vwr2,t3_fnczkq,1584933664.0,i got the piercing back in october. originally 14g 9/16 titanium bars. switched it to gold hoops without a problem. a few weeks after i switched i got the irritation bumps and have had them for about a month. i leave them alone the best i can other than cleaning them in the shower + with the saline spray i got from the piercers. i dont know if it’s allergy related or what. it doesn’t hurt but i generally have problems with healing wounds so im worried about them not healing right. they constantly scab over because the skin around them is so dry but it’s really only one of my nipples that seems to be irritated. i dont pick the scabs i usually just wash them and they fall off on their own. idk what to do to get the bumps to go away n its pretty frustrating at this point. kinda just wanna get rid of them lol
BPD,fjzjc38,t3_ffkikf,1583721091.0,"i have the same problem. i have trouble recalling specific details about ppls appearances, even family members or loved ones. its like if you’re not in my direct line of sight then the only thing i have is the concept of you existing as opposed to all the features that make you up, if that makes sense"
BPD,fjvhs27,t3_ff2rvs,1583627286.0,i never believe people when they say they love me so i definitely need constant confirmation from people. i feel like its more truthful if they just do it unprompted though but usually i cant stop myself from being annoying and asking if im still loved
BPD,fjvgzwg,t3_ff3nqc,1583627079.0,"honestly im the same way but it also depends on my relationship w ppl bc like. if we’re super close, even if they’re very composed ill end up losing my shit lol"
BPD,fjedjd3,t3_fbqptk,1583269884.0,"i have very few memories, usually bad ones. sometimes if someone mentions something i get some vague recollection of it but for the most part it’s just a constant “i don’t remember that but i believe you” kinda thing when people talk about parts of my life. i never understood why i don’t remember considering a lot of my memories are of trauma. my best guess is something worse than what i remember could’ve occurred. don’t really know. wish i did though because what you don’t know can and will find a way to hurt you. i feel like im missing a part of myself but ive always been too afraid to ask about it"
BPD,fjec14v,t3_fc1980,1583269049.0,honestly i feel this way a lot. sometimes my emotions feel so raw that i feel like i genuinely might end my shit if someone even looks at me the wrong way. it sucks not wanting to leave the house because ur afraid someone might kill yr vibes
BPD,fjebtf2,t3_fc2mfh,1583268932.0,i always take pictures or videos of myself crying and honestly i have never understood why lol sometimes the tears just make your features hit different yknow? like i genuinely cannot cry without taking a least one selfie aksjdj
BPD,fjeanex,t3_fcci3m,1583268284.0,"any time i have particularly bad days when i cant come in due to my mental health my boss always asks me if there’s anything we can do to plan accordingly. like do i need time off from work, less hours, etc. and im just like. i dont know??? i cant tell you bc idk how long this is going to affect me. i go through emotions so rapidly that i could literally be perfectly fine tomorrow. i dont plan my breakdowns and therefore cant really plan any way to alleviate them as far as my job goes"
BPD,fje8z2x,t3_fcptyq,1583267349.0,i feel the same way. ive been at my current job for almost a year and its the longest job ive had. i actually really enjoy it. most of the customers are great and i get along well with my coworkers but doing the same thing every day gets extremely overwhelming which. really makes no sense to me. lately ive been feeling so burnt out that i called out three times and one of those days i actually went into work fully intending to work but just literally started sobbing out of nowhere in front of my boss too and had to go home. i actually had to ask him to schedule me less hours to take the stress off me because im so worried im gonna snap and end up destroying everything ive spent almost a year working on
BPD,fje7t9y,t3_fcsiuk,1583266702.0,"im exactly the same way although i usually do it subconsciously. but because ive always felt like sex is my only good attribute due to past trauma i guess i just unintentionally try and entice people that way. i want to be sexy and feel noticed but at the same time when i get the attention i expect it makes me uncomfortable and dirty. it’s a constant battle with myself because im really not a sexual person and the only person i sometimes feel comfortable expressing myself sexually with is my fp and even then it’s not always because im in the mood. dressing provocatively, even if im just going to the store 5 minutes down the road is sometimes the only validation i get lol"
BPD,fje6v9m,t3_fcv98s,1583266375.0,honestly yes. i genuinely feel like an entirely different person after my meltdowns and afterwards when i reflect on those emotions im just like “hm couldnt be me”
BPD,fje6j2b,t3_fcy6qt,1583266189.0,im the exact same way. sometimes my paranoia is so severe it extends to me believing i can’t even think without someone reading my thoughts. it’s very stressful because it’s both terrifying and embarrassing to feel like someone is watching me every time i sing in the shower or the car or while im folding laundry or some other mundane thing. it’s really strange but sometimes i just feel like the walls themselves have eyes and ears
BPD,fhd8wgj,t3_f2kgkn,1581479939.0,"im the same way. i struggle with being highly sympathetic but having little empathy to back me up. i constantly feel like an asshole bc stuff that normally upsets ppl doesn’t upset me. i dont cry at movies or when i hear something bad happened on the news. im able to fully recognize that the situation is horrible and that other people in that situation are upset or angry or whatever but i cant apply that to myself. like unless it personally affects me i just. dont care. anytime people try to tell me problems going on with them im just like. i mean that sucks but why should i care? i feel like a monster sometimes. 

i do have the tendency to feed off other people’s emotions quite aggressively. im upset because they’re upset not because i understand what they’re going through if that makes sense?

so with that being said i wouldnt say i empathize with my fp so much as i just integrate his emotions with mine to kind of. idk minimize his trauma i guess"
BPD,fhbx7tq,t3_f2cb8m,1581451785.0,im the same way. i have to micromanage every part of my day so that way i have energy and motivation to do what i absolutely 100% have to do during the day. it sucks because i have nerve pain on top of being mentally ill so i literally feel like i can do nothing other than homework and going to work without feeling crippled
BPD,febxa5n,t3_eo9pjm,1578963808.0,i fluctuate between intp and istj but usually when i take the test i get intp
BPD,fe9qr63,t3_eo2er2,1578940655.0,"for me, the emptiness is a strange thing to describe. basically i feel like im completely hollow. not like i dont have any bones or organs but basically like i have no soul. like there’s nothing there that makes me human or nothing that makes me, well, me. i feel like i have no backbone as a unique person and im not really living, im just alive. it really does feel like a constant deep seated pain or longing that nothing can really fill. i constantly switch hobbies and interests to try and fill the void because it kinda goes hand in hand with my lack of identity. i dont know who i am on the outside so i dont know what i am or how to feel whole on the inside 


as for the emotional aspect.  being depressed is like. my mood 90% of the time but it’s always more severe than what the situation calls for. like im depressed but when a situation triggers me (and it can be something as stupid as being out of my favorite juice) i react strongly and (obviously) inappropriate to the level of seriousness. i also rapidly cycle through emotions within the span of hours, sometimes even minutes. no matter what though my emotions are theyre always extreme and exaggerated, not that i can really control it that well. sometimes when im having one of my episodes i feel like my reactions are justified but afterwards when i reflect and can see that even though i didnt feel like my emotions were wrong they weren’t healthy responses. most of my anger and aggression is internalized so i never really get interpreted as aggressive, it’s always usually just depressive which almost always ends up working against me"
BPD,fe9of3i,t3_eo5kq8,1578939966.0,i struggle with skin and nerve problems and my flare ups are definitely much worse when im triggered or under severe stress because of my mental state. right now im currently dealing with eczema like symptoms and nerve pain on top of my emotional outbursts
BPD,fcwqsfl,t3_ejbiu4,1578033957.0,i get pretty strong attachments to animals to. right now my cat is basically the crutch of my emotional support. i hate thinking about her dying or running away or just being gone in general. i literally feel like i’d die without her
BPD,faimtpo,t3_e9chvx,1576111669.0,that’s me all the time. i also have a problem with regressing which doesn’t help but ppl always assume im giving them the cold shoulder but like. im really not i just literally cannot bring myself to speak
BPD,fa31rae,t3_e7phne,1575789389.0,i usually never dream but when i do they are almost always super vivid to the point of feeling like real life or like. very psychic and intuitive. other times they’re just point blank nightmares
BPD,f9pzhan,t3_e64zv0,1575552332.0,this is exactly how i feel
BPD,f9khyzn,t3_e5k7qy,1575400840.0,"i feel this hardcore. i fluctuate between never wanting kids and having serious baby fever. my coworker brought her grand baby to work yesterday and i actually started crying because of how badly i felt that i wanted a child. rationally though i know it’s a horrible idea, me having children. im too unstable to care for myself most days and i wouldn’t subject the absolute ugliest parts of me to any child, especially not my own. i just turned 20 a week ago and the urge has seem to have gotten worse"
BPD,f9khdtn,t3_e5ltfv,1575400488.0,exactly how im feeling right now
BPD,f9bsvjj,t3_e4in47,1575215953.0,god this is literally me rn. im being to develop an attachment to someone at work because he’s always so nice to me and im just like. please leave me alone because i dont have the energy to force myself to be on top of my game around you every day but also im too paranoid to stop. i feel like i have to do my best to please them or they wont be nice to me anymore even though realistically i think they’re just a really nice person regardless but my brain tells me that people are only nice to me when i do something to make them that way
BPD,f8xcjtl,t3_e2rxmt,1574914606.0,"i feel this. lately ive been fluctuating between never wanting children and having serious baby fever but no matter my feelings i cant justify bringing children into this world that may end up like me. i wouldnt wish the way i am on anyone, especially not my own children. it sucks but ive resigned myself to just treating my cat as my baby lol but seriously, aside from genetics, i know how badly i struggle to take care of myself and i know i could never provide a child with the physical and emotional support it would need"
BPD,f8w51ok,t3_e2awes,1574883451.0,i know exactly what you mean. yesterday was my birthday too and although i had family and friends i still just felt miserable and alone. it sucks not being able to enjoy the one day out of the year that belongs to you.
BPD,f8t4qxa,t3_e1rybr,1574795768.0,i completely relate and i especially hate it because im not really into sex but ive been used for sex in the past so now my brain just automatically thinks that’s all im good for so anytime time someone is nice to me i just assume thats what they expect from me
BPD,f8h133t,t3_e0rypd,1574568025.0,i think baby refers to somebody newly diagnosed and quiet borderlines dont outwardly display the typical symptoms you think of when you hear bpd. they tend to internalize their emotional distress and act inwards rather than outwards.
BPD,f8h0798,t3_e0s13i,1574567659.0,i have both as well. it’s just an easy way to exert control over myself since i cant control my emotions. or literally any other aspect of my life.
BPD,f879r10,t3_dzdlaa,1574322099.0,i 100% understand. im mostly sex repulsed and have a very low sex drive. if i ever do feel the need to get off its usually out of boredom or as a way to punish myself in some way. i really used to be into sexual things when i was uncomfortably young but now it’s just a nuisance to me. it’s led to me avoiding being alone with my bf because he has a very high sex drive and i feel bad telling him no but it really doesn’t do anything for me. it just feels like something that’s done to me rather than something im participating in. it’s really frustrating because i want to be able to enjoy it so i dont upset my partner but i just can’t feel anything other than indifference.
BPD,f862s0x,t3_dz99ys,1574288576.0,i feel that. i always wonder what parts of myself to share and which parts to deliberately avoid so they don’t realize how unstable i am but also i wonder which parts of myself are even real as opposed to what ive absorbed in an attempt to craft an identity for myself
BPD,f81uwxv,t3_dyli8z,1574177895.0,Mine is a pillow I got from my uncle that I’ve basically had since birth. I’ve had my grandmother repair it several times with new pillow cases and stuffing. I refuse to give him up and can’t sleep unless I have him. It’s also really the only way for me to self-soothe bc if i’m upset I’ll rub my face or fingers against the stitching and it helps calm me down
BPD,f80i028,t3_dy9nlu,1574129507.0,this was me today. my bf texts me good morning almost every day but today he didnt and it drove me mad. i spent all day checking my phone and he didn’t message me once. i honestly wanted to kill myself tbh
BPD,f7erlq8,t3_dvoqeh,1573664277.0,im the same way but i think it stems more from the fact that it’s very hard for me to sit down and focus on something long enough. like i lack motivation to do the things i enjoy so much that i cant even form the attention span for them
BPD,f7bfkjq,t3_dv7zrx,1573567494.0,this literally sums up my entire thought process on the daily
BPD,f6vlh0d,t3_dt92xs,1573189987.0,i have two fps currently so i think you can definitely have that attachment to more than one person.
BPD,f6unklr,t3_dt5dwz,1573165352.0,im the same way. im extremely motivated and passionate at work but ridiculously lethargic at home. i think it’s because im such a people pleaser and im terrified of failure so the idea of impressing others really motivates me to get my job done but at home the only person who im pushing for is myself and well. i really dont care about myself so i dont care about doing anything.
BPD,f6pghhp,t3_dshj4a,1573055819.0,"i do the same thing. i always pick at everything until it ends up scarring. i’m bad with scratching too, even if it’s not something that itches"
BPD,f6pgbxm,t3_dshn08,1573055720.0,i’m an intp
BPD,f6fjiqz,t3_dr3u8d,1572815066.0,I feel this way all the time. It’s hard for me to get close to people because i cant tell the difference between genuine feelings and what ive warped and idealized in my head. sometimes i just wonder if im actually capable of loving when my emotions flip flop so much that i dont actually know what love is at all. i mean my family and friends tell me they love me all the time but i cant really trust them because i dont comprehend love on a level that doesn’t involve obsession and devaluation
BPD,f6cq8dg,t3_dqxxu6,1572787714.0,honestly when my ed resurfaces its all i can think abt. im 100% preoccupied with myself so i cant even really think about my other problems and like. it makes me so numb to everything that my emotional outbursts are seldom if non existent. i think that’s one of the reasons why i do it though because that feeling of being in control of myself is at least somewhat permanent for that time being
BPD,f5fwefk,t3_dntyl9,1572187444.0,i honestly feel the same way but i usually dump all my effort into a relationship in the beginning and then my efforts being to burn out after i realise that im probably gonna be abandoned in the end
