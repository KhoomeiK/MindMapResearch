doordash,fqul09e,t3_gkvcq0,1589660606.0,This is just a theory so take this lightly but I feel like this has to do with the outdated (old head) view of a job where commitment and loyalty to a company meant you were doing your job correctly. I feel like people in my generation (20 years old) realize that jobs are more of a partnership between DD as we are both essential to the other. This is the same view with people who accept low paying orders instead of carefully choosing what orders are worth it for the demand/area/mileage aspect.

BipolarReddit,f1ckvib,t3_d8jc0i,1569359705.0,This may sound like a vague answer but maybe write down some guidelines/warning signs of manic symptoms you have. Keep a checklist through the day and keep note whenever you feel yourself getting carried away/anxious. Whenever you notice that those things are happening more focus on using techniques that work for you to calm down and bring yourself back to ground level. While taking new risk is a sign of manic behavior wanting to further yourself is a normal human behavior and I wish you the best on you and your aunts buisness
