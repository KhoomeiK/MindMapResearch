I've been there and I feel for him heavy. It's really hard to come back from those experiences 100%. I can see why he may be paranoid sometimes when his past consisted of, well, inconsistencies. 

*However*, that gives him no excuse to call you names and have uncontrolled bursts of emotion, even going so far as to make threats! It not only makes you upset, but damages your relationship with one another. 

If you really want to attempt to give him another chance, put your foot down girl. Set boundaries. If his insecurities *really* bother him that much, he needs to communicate with you about them rather than immediately coming at you with hostility and accusing you of things just by hearing noises in the back of your phone calls. 

Most importantly , I mean this 100% with empathy as a person who's been in his shoes, he needs to see a therapist. You will not have a healthy relationship moving forward unless he learns to cope with his past and understand that not everyone in his life is going to hurt him. Even if you do break up, he needs it for his future connections with others."

 Whilst the mother definitely could have gone about it in a better manner- I don't think constantly blaming a kid's actions, who is perfectly capable of responsibility in their teens, on the parent will teach them anything.

Having an animal to take care of is a huge one and it teaches them a lot of life lessons for when they're older. that's just my opinion, obviously we don't have to agree on everything :-)"

I find really fucked up things funny, especially things that should be serious– 9/11, deaths, and yes, there's some racist jokes out there that are funny. But as long as I *know* I'm not a shitty person and don't actually believe in those things, I'm happy laughing at it.
