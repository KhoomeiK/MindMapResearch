If the safety precautions are taken, and there no leaks from the propane tank to the ooni, and the area is vented, what danger does it pose that a traditional gas range does not? 

You can't answer that question, and you have done nothing to try to answer that question. I'd be happy to be proven wrong but you have done nothing to try to prove that specific argument wrong.
