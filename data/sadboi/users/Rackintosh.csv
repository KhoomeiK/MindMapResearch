depression,fm9ozyq,t1_fm9mftj,1585873336.0,"That’s lovely that you shared all of that about yourself because I was just thinking of asking how you were doing but decided not to because I guess I thought it would be too personal, intimate or intrusive to hear from me, a stranger, randomly. I actually double checked to see if I actually sent it and thought I was going a little nutso buttso! 

I’m really glad to hear you’re doing better today and that video games helped you out in such a way. Also wonderful that you were able to have the energy and ability to exercise to boot. I play a lot of video games, but mostly just to get me through my entire days, distract and make my life more bearable, satisfying and enjoyable. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn’t. I also play music—albeit a depression playlist—on Spotify, while I play my games, in the background. Not much else I can do though, when I’m at my lows. I’m a romantic, so what comforts me the most, unfortunately, is the dependence of intimacy, comfort and personal care of another."

Thought, at the first dozen times of watching it, when he was playing, that he was talking too much, but after my several dozen times of watching the clip, I'm glad he did. Great, endearing stuff. Really adds to it.  


Edit: Dammit. I forgot to mention his choice and warm, gentle timing in chord progression too—similar to Vangelis. Whole reason why I wanted to spotlight the guy in the first place. So damn cool."

I struggle with severe mental illness as well and a lot of the comments in this section are bumming me out and are hardly ever that helpful. Not all that understanding. While I'm not all that experienced with self-harm, as I've only done it a couple times—years ago—by busting my forehead open with a frying pan or my fist, I do struggle with severe depression, social anxiety, and just all-around miserable. You have my sincerest best wishes, OP, and if you're really short on friends or people to chat with, open invite to talk and vent to me. I'm a bit on the old side—almost 30—but if that doesn't bother you, I'll try and be the best and most friendly company I can be. Again, open invite. Please feel free to decline, okay?
