I know charities and their management pay almost very little attention to GP margins but that's a GP margin of 85%. Very high for a chairty.

It's funny how people are like ""her salaries are only 60k from the charity"" but they forget about her passive income like rent from the charity.  

Her supporters claim that BCR don't run the sanctuary like a zoo, and that the documentary shows it incorrectly, however, they have raised approx. 18% of their total funds from letting people tour the sanctuary. In 2017 and in 2018 it has rissen to over 25%. They may not be abusing the cats like private zoos but they are also profiting from their sanctuary and contradicting their non-profit status.

>Big Cat Rescue Corporation (the Organization) is a nonprofit organization in Hillsborough County, Florida which was formed under the laws of the State of Florida on April 4, 1995. Our Organization’s mission is to provide the best home we can for the cats in our care, end abuse of big cats in captivity and prevent extinction of big cats in the wild. We accomplish this through educational guided tours of the sanctuary, which houses a substantial number of abused, abandoned, orphaned or retired big cats, school education programs, multi-month training programs including housing for interns from around the world, advocacy, and support of in situ conservation projects. The primary sources of income from the Organization are derived from educational tours and contributions from individuals, foundations and corporations. 

Both in 2017 and 2018, more than quarter of the funds raised was through educational tours and activities."
