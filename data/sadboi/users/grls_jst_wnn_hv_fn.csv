BPD,f6uxrp0,t3_dt0vqq,1573171331.0,"Oh my fucking god! Preach! They call us paranoid and then do the things we predicted they’d do! And then write it off as “self fulfilled prophecy” well, maybe we are a tad more perceptive because we are over analytical, did they ever think that?"
BPD,f6usvoe,t3_dt0vqq,1573167893.0,"Ha! The number of times I have been called an overthinking psycho, by some of my closest friends, and then ended up being right about a situation I suspected. Maybe being borderline does make you more perceptive of others’ shady behaviour because you’re so fucked up in your head, you anticipate the shitty behaviours that non borderline people suppress? So when they come to surface, they are no surprise to you. Sometimes I wonder if I seek out the situations I end up in or I just see the shitty outcome more clearly than others would because I’m borderline. Worst superpower ever?"
BPD,f6nxz5e,t3_ds7mni,1573002863.0,"Oh dear, so it’s not just me?! Anticipating the next low? Thank you, darling! Maybe one day we’ll be there?"
BPD,f1g19hd,t1_f1g08uj,1569457655.0,"You sweet sausage! They won’t, unless you tell them, and I know that’s the hardest part. My paranoia has almost pushed some of the closest people away. And ruined some close relationships, and I still battle with myself, every waking hour, but the ones I opened up to have them opened up to me about their own mental health problems. And it made us even stronger. Unless we discuss these issues, we’ll never find comfort. Yes, it’s scary, but you’ll be surprised as to how many struggle with similar or other issues. And if they don’t, you always have reddit and other people around you who might"
BPD,f1g0n08,t3_d9any5,1569457249.0,"Ah, yes, the lovely feeling of being left out and a burden, don’t we all love those? If your friends are not familiar with the issues you are going through, then, unless you can (and should, because they’re your friends) step over the feeling of being a burden and educate them, you have the option of finding the support network of people who do understand.
Isn’t this why you’re here? Because there are so many like minded individuals who will support you! Just be honest with your friends, really honest, but in a constructive way. And know that there’s a community of people you don’t even know who support you"
BPD,f1fzvut,t1_f1fyjj6,1569456762.0,"They are still there for you, they probably just don’t know how to cope with this. Talk to them, constructively, show them articles, let them in, you may be surprised at the level of support you may receive in return"
BPD,f1fzh9e,t3_d9any5,1569456501.0,"Mate, I still sometimes attack my best friend with “you hate me, really, don’t you? You all do!” But I came here because I needed to talk about the shit that I’ve felt, for the past couple of days and instead I noticed a kindred spirit, at the top of the page, crying out for help for the same things I’ve cried for help for. You may feel like this is the final setting of your life, but it’s not. We all have each other, to say the least. I don’t know you, but I feel you and want you to be ok at least to the point of being able to take a breath without that painful knot of anxiety pressing on your chest. And to smile and have hope for tomorrow"
BPD,f1fz1eu,t3_d9any5,1569456216.0,"And that’s the hardest part of having BPD. Those around you not hearing your cries for help, because you’re always too scared to express them. I often found myself on the same trap, actively pushing people away because all I wanted was for them to be there for me because I mentioned my mental health. This is not to say that people will never recognise what you’re going through, but you need to talk to them, educate them, explain what it’s like for you. And yes, some will fail you nonetheless. But I can vouch for one thing: those who have stuck around and accepted me are alike those that others like me most likely also have in their lives, unknowingly"

BPD,f1fwcbn,t1_f1fw34v,1569454482.0,"And I’ve felt that way myself. Just a few days ago. And then, I grasped onto a small glimmer of hope and it pulled me through. So no, I won’t. Because you are worth it. I know how hard it is to find a reason to not give up, when you’ve pushed all the people around you away, but the right ones won’t allow to be pushed away! Don’t. Fucking. Give. Up!"
BPD,f1fvy4i,t3_d9any5,1569454228.0,"OP you’re not alone, and though I myself am going through a tough time, I find solace in remembering all the good things that have happened and knowing that someone else may feel the same way I do right now makes it easier. Not because I’m glad someone else is miserable, but because I know that feeling the warmth and support towards them without even knowing them means someone else may feel that towards me. Please know you’re not alone and things have been better and they will be again"
