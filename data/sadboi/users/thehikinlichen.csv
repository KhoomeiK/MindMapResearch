childfree,fgkudjc,t1_fgkrt6s,1580873816.0,"Chiming in as an anti-natalist though I certainly do not speak for all who are childfree. So everything in this comment is coming from my personal perspective and should not be construed as being emblematic of all or even a majority of Childfree people. 

Of course I ""accept"" people having one or two kids like... They're here already and I don't believe in genocide. Those children are here whether they like it or not and have to participate in creating a better future. You made the decision to have some progeny and that's well within your rights. 

I do view bringing people into existence as unethical though. Partially because most people who talk about their decision to have children talk about it as if it weren't a decision at all and put more forethought into their coffee order than into understanding that they are bringing someone into consciousness *without their consent*. That that life is every bit as rich and valid and ripe for incredible pain and suffering as your own. I feel like I've never met  a parent who has honestly thought about the incredible struggles their child might face. I'm not talking just systemically, people are even *more* resistant to taking a hard look at what they are bringing to the equation. Relationship instability, financial instability, emotional maturity, chronic illness, mental illness, etc. If you are dissatisfied with your life why on Earth - why is the ""moral"" or ""normal"" thing to bring another person into it ""so they can grow up to change the world"" instead of *rolling up your sleeves and fixing it yourfuckingself*. 

Another is many people are imbued with an awful ideal of ""fuck you, I got mine"" when it comes to raising their progeny. How can those sorts of people claim moral superiority and call the childfree ""selfish"" and then turn around and espouse an ideal where nothing is more important in the entire world than their own DNA? How can we be seen as the  ""selfish ones"" when some of the greatest crimes of oppression and rrasure in history have been committed by people claiming it's ""for the children""? How can people call us selfish yet turn a blind eye towards the hundreds of thousands of children who are already born and suffering and without homes while they spend thousands of dollars and their health on IVF? 

we as a species are nearly incapable of any sort of objectivity and many people struggle with even relativism. What you say is a ""great life"" may not be your child's definition of what constitutes a great life - what then? Did you fail as a parent to instill your exact beliefs upon your child or did they fail as a growing person to willingly conform to your expectations? 

 A child born in the United States today will consume many times their share of global resources than their counterpart born in most any other part of the world and is born into a country with incredible wealth inequality that they are most likely to be on the worse end of - which brings us to one of the grandest hypocrisies of our age - those who are ""scared for the future of the world"" but unblinkingly sentence their children to it."

I am currently a junior doing undergrad work for a degree in history, however, I am a transfer student and have completed all my requisite courses already and only have 2 more required history section classes to take to fulfill my degree requirements. I spent a long time in and out of community college so I have the pre-reqs fulfilled for Humanities, English Lit, and Poli Sci. History is my passion and no matter the field I end up in, I absolutely want that to be my focus.

But I still need to fill 3 semesters worth of classes to meet the unit requirement for graduation. This semester ended up being 5 upper division History courses and frankly it was a nightmare. I want to explore some minor options but my department counselor is literally useless and I can't get reassigned another so I am lacking perspective and sound advice from people who are in the field. So I'd love some advice or even just to hear what sort of path you took! 

So far the path I'd like to take is:
- BA in History
- MA in Public History

I have not ruled out the possibility of going for a doctorate, I'd love to, but I don't want to get wrapped up in worrying about it yet. Pie in the sky dream goals would be either opening my own museum or going on to a doctorate in archaeology or I also love the idea of public service and public policy making and have considered that a law degree might be something I'll eventually pursue if I head that direction. (The latter is honestly probably the most pragmatic from my current point of view - I live in a capital city and thus have a lot of opportunity for involvement and internships).

I have kind of narrowed it down to my minor being Political Science or Anthropology but then again, there's so much out there I'm probably not considering so I'd love to hear about the paths and experiences of others! Thank you!"

And I don't want to believe how many NParents have done this by reading these stories, but also... my NBirthGiver did the exact same thing. 

She and my NStepDad bought a little house in a ""hick town"" because they like to pretend they are ""country"" but began running into problems because while this ""hick town"" was cheap, it was a 1-3 hour commute on average for each of them. They also both insisted on driving ridiculously inefficient trucks (again with the ""country"" thing)  so it was working out poorly. At the very height of the bubble they bought another house in the suburbs for $750k. It was a total piece of shit ticky-tacky McMansion that had so many issues, not to mention they couldn't afford to furnish it (and literally never did until they moved out again like 2 years later). 


So 2 houses, 2 duallies, a commuter car they took turns driving, a new baby, they each had a degree from an online school that folded as a scam later but was like $30k, and somewhere in the neighborhood of $20k in credit card debt. . . bankruptcy time. They drained my college account (that my grandparents and dad had contributed roughly 80-90% of) to buy their trucks outright so they couldn't be repossessed, and made me get a job at 15 so i could ""learn the meaning of hard work"" a.k.a. pay for literally everything they deemed as ""my responsibility""- food, clothing, rent for my unfurnished bedroom, gas, etc. I was never a ""bad kid"". I had college coaches already watching me at my sport and had perfect grades and took a dozen AP classes, while also forced to raise their kid (my half-sister) whenever I was at their house. They refinanced and leased newer, stupider trucks like less than 6 months later. 

I don't really know why I haven't gone full NC. 10 years ago and I'm still seething whenever I think about it. I am 27 and have paid my way through my first three years of school without a cent taken in loans so I'm fucking exhausted all the time, and I can't help but feel the last 10 years of unmitigated disaster and hardship in my life would have been much different if they hadn't shot me in the foot at the starting line."
