amazon,fp12sv2,t1_foz1wie,1588222861.0,Yes true but amazon also has a very high turnover rate. They have been hiring non stop to replace the ones that donâ€™t make it not even a week. Sure that is why the robotics work out best. Itâ€™s very physical work. I stay because I need to lose some weight ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜‚

Hopefully it helps me feel better and will start working out again, eating better, lay off the alcohol and drink vitamins.  Need to get out of this depression hole. Much luck to you!!!"
