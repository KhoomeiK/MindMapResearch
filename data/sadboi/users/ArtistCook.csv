You could also think about getting some lighter tones. You can always darken markers woth colpur combinations or layering, but its not always easy to lighten colours."

The 4th book of a series I absolutely love! It was a second reread after a couple of years abd I remember why I like it so much!

Started: The Black Echo by Michael Connelly
The first book of the Harry Bosche series. I read Two Kinds of Truth a while back and wanted to read more. I was given a bunch of his books so now I can start at the beginning!

books,folwbb5,t3_g5v5wp,1587872031.0,"I had always been a reader growing up, but in high school I was very genre specific: fantasy adventure kind of stuff. I did read a few books outside of these for school assignments, but I was not open to the majority of them. I had the switch from being genre specific to trying out many genres. Found out I loved modern thrillers in this experience.

I feel it can be a mix of a lot of things for kids not to read. Force read books (not just schools but family and friends), not being pushed enough to try books, more accessible ways of entertainment without books (YouTube, social media, Netflix, etc.). I feel like theres more than this but these seem prominent from what I can tell.

It's one of those things where I wish there was a perfect solution to get kids to read, but sometimes it may not match to their personalities."

truezelda,fmhs5ni,t3_fvar0y,1586091900.0,"Ocarina of time is one due to it being my entry way of learning how to play a game. It sounds weird, but I never really played a game fully until this one. I did use a guide, but it was my foundation for later games without using a guide.

Wind Waker is also nostalgic to me. It was the second one I played and I love it from start to finish. I only beat the main story line; I didn't complete a lot of the side quests or build my map to completion.

Four Swords Adventures for the Gamecube is one I don't look back on often, and I don't classify it as a favourite but it is one I throughly enjoyed and get nostalgic about. Sadly I played it alone and I played it years after its release and didn't own a Gameboy Advance, so i didn't get the whole experience."

Not having 4 of the 6 memories for Harry and Dumbledore to investigate. These were important in not only the story of Voldemort but also what the future horcruxes would be. That's how they figure out the important things to beat Voldemort.

I also missed the scene between Harry and Dumbledore where Dumbledore is telling Harry he has a choice, and that Voldemort is the reason why the prophecy came to be. That Harry wants to take Voldemort down not because of the prophecy, but that Harry actually wants to.

Both these scenes also play on the importance of choice, that choices make us who we are, not what we were born to be."

harrypotter,fkd0fyy,t3_fhow05,1584065389.0,"I am so glad you pointed this out. It's something I needed to hear.

have been recently reevaluating my view of the movies. I did not enjoy them a lot of the time because of cutting out many scenes. I love stories with a lot of content and subplots.

But in the last while, I have shifted my view on the movies, and even watched a couple of them so far. (Philosophers Stone and Order of the Phoenix). I took out comparing them to the books and just watched.

I throughly enjoyed both movie. Especially Order of the Phoenix. I understand a lot of the changes made, and a lot of the choices were really good ones. And the movie was enjoyable as heck.

I'm looking forward to watching the rest of these movies with a better perspective.

While there are changes that I will not enjoy, for the most part the changes make sense (timing and visual) and I feel there were times they did what they could."

AskReddit,fj09lke,t3_fanoll,1582894023.0,"Scrolling through social media constantly.

I got into a bad mindset, so I uninstalled all social media apps off my phone and got rid of all my shortcuts on my pc. 

The first week of this, it blew me away how many times I'd pick up my phone without thinking about it. Since I had uninstalled all the apps, it was easier to not do it.

These moments changed how I deal with spare moments; I'm not in bed nearly as long, I end up reading a lot more, I watch more meaningful YouTube videos, I'll put on music when I want some noise but don't want to watch something, and I have moments of calm because I'm not comparing myself to others.

Now I have popped on social media on occassion via pc, but it's not as comfotable scrolling because it's not as convenient, so I end up not being on for long. I end up feeling bored and wanting to actually do something.

To me, social media is a great platform for connecting and getting inspiration, but it can be toxic if it effects you physically and/or mentally."

Hiding it in an empty room wouldn't have been effective enough. The room may have generated stuff to make it easier to hide. The room did generate stuff when the DA needed items for practice. And it provided beds and things for when people were hiding in Deathly Hallows.
