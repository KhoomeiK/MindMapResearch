reactivedogs,fbevy99,t3_ecws94,1576795232.0,"I found my local place on the recommendation of a friend who also has a reactive dog. It's primarily a training facility, but they do offer daycare and boarding. Each dog gets their own room and my dog is taken in to the play area alone or with another dog she is comfortable with. It's competitively priced and my dog loves it there."
dogs,fbe3q3g,t3_ecto4v,1576777518.0,"I found a new treat recipe my GSD loves. You slice up a banana, freeze it, roll the slices in peanut butter and unsweetened shredded coconut, and freeze the slices again. 

She absolutely goes nuts for these treats and you can make a bunch and keep them for a few days."

dogs,fbbbld2,t3_ecfqwc,1576697063.0,I switched my GSD over at about 14 months. That was the recommendation on the package and my vet said that was fine. Check with your vet for best results.
dogs,fbarb9i,t1_fbalt5f,1576685044.0,That sounds like a great idea! I've seen similar buckets at my dog's daycare. I'll try it out. Thanks!
dogs,fbaqank,t1_fbaiprz,1576684400.0,"It depends on the day. Typically, she's crated from 8:30-5 with a short walk and pee break at around 1:30. She is also crated overnight from about 10:30-6. If I have an exam at school then she comes with me.

On days I work she is crated from 7:30-5 with a short walk and pee break around 1:30

On weekends she is typically only crated at bedtime."
dogs,fbaimcl,t1_fbai19k,1576679150.0,"I'm pretty sure she's either clumsy or playing with the bowls. The bowls are always in perfectly fine condition, just knocked over or loosened."
dogs,fb967we,t3_ec0ufj,1576630401.0,"Chuckit balls, antlers, and Himalayan yak chews are great gift ideas suitable for a variety of dogs imo"
reactivedogs,fb89v4e,t1_fb868s6,1576609292.0,Glad I could help! You sound like you have a really good attitude. I'm sure you'll do well!
reactivedogs,fb82etl,t1_fb811s7,1576604662.0,"Honestly, If there's one thing I wish I learned sooner, it's that whenever you work with your dog you have to be calm, unstressed, and have your anxiety under control. I don't know much that applies to you but that's what it took for me to see my first major progress. The mindset is really important."
reactivedogs,fb7w2yo,t1_fb7tm2o,1576600684.0,"You can also position your hand such that the V of your thumb is along the spine. This position requires you to curve your hand a bit more for effectiveness. Have 4 fingers on one side of the spine and the side of the hand on the other. Apply pressure using the entire thumb and side of the hand, in addition to the 4 fingers on the other side"
reactivedogs,fb7v2rj,t1_fb7tm2o,1576600046.0,"You can do it either way. Personally, I have limited movement in my left hand so I only use my right hand. I like to position my hand such that the thumb and first finger are on one side of the spine, the middle finger is on/above the spine, and the ring and pinky fingers are on the other side of the spine."
reactivedogs,fb7otum,t3_ebw1y6,1576595853.0,"One thing that took a long time for me to understand is that your dog feeds off of your emotions and anxiety. Once I was able to control those, it was like everything clicked and I saw significant improvement."
reactivedogs,fb7hvus,t1_fb7gbea,1576590520.0,"She's definitely better at the training facility. But I've absolutely seen improvements at home and outside as well. Prior to becoming reactive, my dog was in training to become my service dog, so we also train at a local outdoor mall and various dog friendly stores. It did take a lot of work to see gains outside of the training facility though."
reactivedogs,fb7h9th,t1_fb7fr3g,1576589985.0,"Sure thing! I'll see if I can shoot a video when I get home from work.

What you're basically doing is using the heel of the hand and the pads of the fingers to provide comforting pressure and relieve muscle tension in the dog. This, combined with the positive talk and treats, calms the dog down.

If you've ever played the piano, the hand position is similar. You want your hand comfortably spread out but slightly curved like they're resting on a small ball. You then press into the dog's flesh with your hand and apply pressure downwards starting from the base of the neck to the base of the tail. Release your hand, bring it up to the neck, and repeat. It is important you stroke only in one direction. You should see the dog begin to relax within a few minutes but this can vary with how stressed your dog is.

Does that help explain things? Let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can clear up!"
dogs,fb63d62,t3_ebnb8p,1576540369.0,"Is she crate trained? If not, that may help. Some form of regular training sessions is also something that may provide good mental exercise in addition to puzzle toys. Fetch and flirt poles are good backyard options for exercise if long walks don't work."
Dogtraining,fb5kakq,t1_fb5h5z4,1576529209.0,"Got it. How can I make sure my dog doesn't get too exhausted because I already practice our training twice daily for about 20 minutes each?

What is a good goal to set for daily training?"
Dogtraining,fb5jzfd,t1_fb5hmq4,1576529050.0,This sounds like a solid idea. Thanks for the advice!
Dogtraining,fb5hrd0,t3_ebkfuq,1576527839.0,"Do you reward her when she gets off by herself? My GSD used to constantly jump on the couch and when I started rewarding her when she got off on command she started improving much more quickly. Also, training a solid leave it may be helpful."
reactivedogs,fb1q16v,t1_fb1l2mx,1576439592.0,Thanks for the tip! I had never heard of CARE before. To be honest I'm pretty unfamiliar with all the different terms. I mostly just do what my trainer says and it usually works. I'll look into it and try it out! Thanks again!
aww,fav7ptx,t1_fav6zkc,1576356421.0,Yup! She got to stay right there and take a nice nap after our walk.
dogs,fape67n,t1_fapdh17,1576286442.0,She developed some separation anxiety. The daycare I use wouldn't take her during heat and she chewed through her crate pan so I had to take her with me everywhere. Thankfully the anxiety went away after the heat was over.
dogs,fapbeu9,t3_eac9eh,1576284729.0,"My GSD actually got more reactive post-heat. It's something we're working on now, months later. I took her everywhere but I bought tarps and cuttable car mats off of Amazon to cover carpet, furniture, and the car interior. 

My dog was taken over by heat nuttiness so be prepared for some unexpected behavior. Also consider getting some doggy diapers. I found them pretty helpful although some dogs just chew them up.

Best of luck!"
dogs,faoow9k,t1_faonjvg,1576269217.0,That's definitely something to consider. I'm not sure it was the food since it started about 3 months after she switched over. You never know though. I'll keep an eye out. Thanks!
dogs,faon1i3,t1_faolp06,1576268006.0,"Yeah, that's a good point. I was hoping I could avoid the vet bill but I'll call the vet and make an appointment. Thanks!"

dogs,f25r81s,t1_f25q0xw,1569981704.0,Thanks! That's good to know. I didn't consider her age. Hopefully she will mellow out a bit as she ages. I love her but it can be a bit tiring at times.
dogs,f25r3up,t1_f25qadz,1569981618.0,"That's a good point. I usually walk the same trail every time since it's close to my place, but we have a lake nearby that might be a good option. Thanks!"
