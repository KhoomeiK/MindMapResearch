        my_list.append('something')
    
    while True:

learnpython,fm7zuyp,t3_ftngqt,1585840099.0,"Yes, yes, yes to your first three questions.

For the function, I'll re-write it a bit:

    def insert(s, c):
            N = len(s)
            for i in range(0, N + 1):
                if i - 2 >= 0:  ##Rewrote the if statements
                    left = i - 2
                else:
                    left = 0
                if i + 2 <= N:

                else:
                    right = N

Now the last part of the function, let's assume we're working with ""a"" and the string is currently ""aabbac""

Let's also assume that left is == 1 and right is == 5.

The if statement is saying `if ""aa"" not in ""abbac""` (which it isn't) then do something.

That something to do is to add ""a"" in the middle of the string. So it splits the string (`s[:i]` and `s[1:]`)from the current position (i) of the for loop where it met the correct conditions (`""aa"" not in ""abbac""`) and adds ""a"" in the middle, and then returns True and the new string with the added ""a"".

        ##I didn't change any of this code.  
         if c * 2 not in s[left:right]:
            s = s[:i] + c + s[i:]
            return True, s
    return False, s

In your example, the for loop is extracting two variables from the enumerated object. This is done so you can reference each value in a list.

Taking your example and changing it a bit:
