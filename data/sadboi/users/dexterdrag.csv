Anxiety,foyct5w,t3_ga4evn,1588170152.0,"I was in a similar position, did flunk my semester and had to repeat it. Prior to that incident, I was a good student producing consistently good results. It took such a mental toll on me. For me, it was the humiliation from those who knew me. I kept thinking in my head that everyone will look down and sympathise in that disgusting and embarrassing manner. I feel like dying then. I feel like a total failure. I do still carry some of the embrassment till now but that is mainly because of how I am as a person, never able to let bad episodes pass. In truth, no one actually cares and no one has brought up that topic after reasonable time has passed. I'm able to make do and go through life normally as if I've never ever flunk that damn semester. The only lasting impact is the emotional trauma since I myself refused to let it go. Otherwise, if I am mentally strong, it really is a thing of the past. Despite me holding onto remnants of the humiliation, I can honestly say it is merely a shadow now. Notwithstanding, my horrible trait of holding onto depressing moments, I'm able to continue with my life and I can safely and honestly tell you that my current problems do not stem from that incident. What I'm trying to say, from an objective angle, this issue is not a long lasting issue if I choose so. I wish you only the best"
depression,foy9r0o,t3_g9z4ge,1588168430.0,"You know how movies sometime romanticised beautiful people who suffer. You always see in movies, how the broken are so beautiful and there is this desperate need to save them because they are more than their problem. I can't say the same for myself. I am avegerage looking, normal and nothing special in most if not all aspects of life. I don't have a terrible life either. I should be fine yet I am unhappy, unsatisfied, hopeless. My self destructive traits justify my unhappiness. In a way, it tells me this is why I am unhappy. I've tried restraining from these habits but I actually feel worse. Once I take away these self made issues, I'm just nothing. A bleeding boring blob. My problems keep me grounded, in a way."

In the first place, I don't want any attention but the absence of attention on a day people deemed it is customary and normal to receive attention, highlights that I am severely lacking as a person. This highlight makes me feel less of a human.

As if the happiness is weighted down. I have this constant urge and desperate need of wanting things to be done and over with but I don't know what it is. All I want is this undefined feeling to be over. At the same time I don't feel like I want to actually die. I do however wish I can find out when I'll die so I will know how to apportion my life accordingly. I look forward to the end of the day because that means the day is done but at the same time I get anxious because a new day will start soon and this feeling is really tiring me out. There are many times that I just want to disappear into thin air. I don't know how is that any difference than death but to me apparently it is. Ultimately, that is it. I don't want to die but I don't feel like living either. I just want things to stop"

I used to sought help that it was terribly affecting me but I was dismissed and I felt even worse. I think I've now grown to not want people. I hate going to any gathering even.

Point is, it is not impossible to be unhappy"

If I could have it my way, I would want to isolate myself and earn just enough to survive and live my life quietly. I can't though. I have to work, interact with people, make mistakes and these give me anxiety. I use bulimia to cope with my anxiety which gets worse if I can't vomit. Purging to me feels like I'm also flushing out my negative emotions and thoughts out too. If I don't have my bulimia, I'm not sure how to cope. I tried to force myself to stop and somewhat believed myself to have recovered for an embarrassingly short period of time until I succumbed to it again. Funny thing, just today, I was wondering if I can just die. Don't see a point in living if it really is just routine. Bulimia, in a way, made me feel alive. I mean, bit hard to ignore when your heart is racing."

Work, home, sleep, repeat cycle. My friends most likely find me annoying for even complaining. How do I explain to them that hey, I am unhappy and just because I have the minimum covered like a job that can pay rent and buy the basic grocery and other necessities, doesn't mean I can't I feel this way. I know there are other people that have it worse than me, far worse but I just am not happy and I feel meaningless. They probably go here it goes again, the complain. The thing is I only complain because I feel like this is crazy, how can I work for 10 years and still unable to find a purpose in life? I talk so much about it because feeling my life has no purpose has become part of the of this rudimentary routine. Sometimes I wish they can just terminate the friendship and tell me the truth rather than either ghost me or passive aggressive tell me off. I wish they end this with me. I wish everything ends with me. So tired with life. Same ol same ol"

I used to read similar anecdotes and wonder if it is true, I mean it is something very routine and simple at the end of the day but that was until I tried it myself. Mine was in the same vein. I told myself I'm going to wash my hair, iron my clothes, leave the house at a certain time and catch the train to get some stuffs. Today, I did that and thereafter felt calm, like I can breathe.

Why, as you so correctly point out, I find myself trapped is because I don't know how to even go about to figure out what makes me happy in the first place. I feel even more helpless when I see other people around me happy and thriving in life whilst I only skate through it. I've had satisfaction, contentment, enjoyment but never achieved true happiness and this inability makes me feel that my life has no purpose."

Funny when someone asked if I enjoyed working and when I replied I'm indifferent because it is just work to me I was told that I'm too young to feel like this and how am I to survive if this is my outlook at this age. I was told to look for other jobs that pay more and allow more flexibility. I feel so depressed hearing that because it makes me feel extremely dumb and incompetent like it is that easy to get a high paying job with great flexibility and I unlike the mass am not able to clinch such a job. It also makes me feel so low, like I am that worthless that I have to settle for this job and lifestyle. Unfortunately, I don't have the qualification that is in demand where I can just go around and make demands. In my current position, more money means more work and boy, do I feel what is on my plate is enough. I hate it when people kept saying impliedly that, at the end of the day, I am not successful.

depression,fe8i0jf,t1_fe6xqci,1578926390.0,"Oh wow. That line ""to fund a life I am not entirely sure is worth living"". I question myself a lot on this. We spend most of our waking moments at work. The money from work, we spend it on holiday, clothes, items, which provide a temporary boost of enjoyment. However, at the end of the day we still clock in and out. I feel the money spent on those enjoyments are as a goal for us to look forward and to be happy but I also feel that it is there as a goal because we are generally not happy in the first place otherwise it wouldn't bring us so much enjoyment and thereafter depression when we have to go back to reality (talking more about myself here). If we are not happy then, realistically and statistically, it has to be due to what we have mainly be doing with our life which is working. Then again, I need to work, otherwise I can't even live. I mean I need a roof, food and all those necessities to survive but it also begs the question, why do I need to survive in the first place? What is the purpose of me being alive?

bulimia,fe8b6fy,t3_enxhs9,1578924391.0,"The thing is I'm unhappy with and without bulimia. I hate that I look at it as a method to cope with the negative aspects of my life. As much as I derive satisfaction from the physical sensations of purging, I hate that I actually enjoy it. Also, I hate that in the span of time I do not succumb to bulimia, I feel like I am hollow and bland and cannot justify my state of unhappiness. It doesn't make sense to me that when I don't purge, I am still not happy. I know it is not easy and I shouldn't treat it as a mental switch but I am so frustrated that when I stop purging, I feel more unhappy. I feel so pissed at times, like what else do I need to do to be happy and content with my life? Shouldn't dealing and overcoming the constant struggles to purge suffice? What else? Why do I feel even more depressed and shitty when I don't resort to my bulimic tendencies? I actually try to be better but don't get better (although I have to admit that the longest I spent without purging is 2 weeks, not long by any standard). At this juncture, I am just tired.

I have this buzz too but it is very specific to prior to a binge. It really is an all consuming emotion. I can feel the emotion spreading in my body and numbing just about everything but the thought that I'm going to binge. I keep telling myself that please treat it like a normal meal and stop it at there. Everyone has a normal meal and it is normal. Human beings are expected to eat to survive. Getting a meal is perfectly and absolutely normal. But when the buzz is there, frankly speaking, no matter how I try to rationalize with myself, I know that I will binge then purge. The buzz actually makes my head and body feel as if white noise is coursing through it. Numb and expanded with the sole emotion that I will binge then purge. I've never been successful from not succumbing to BP when the buzz is there maybe with an exception of circumstances like I cannot escape the meal to purge in time. But it is such a rare occurrence and too risky to rely on something that only materialise by chance."
depression,f7nqsa5,t3_dx2la6,1573913323.0,"I can definitely relate to this. I feel extremely and terribly inferior to the people around me. This results into me escaping more and excarbates the inferior feeling when I am required to appear in public. Also, the fact is, escapism makes me numb to the depression and anxiety, so I escape and will always choose that route to the extent that I hardly care about anything that doesn't provide me the same results as escapism. This, in my opinion, is slowly resulting into me becoming a version that lacks depth and personality because even if there is a version that is remotely rich in details, it is the version that I am not willing to share with the world and even those close to me. In the end, I don't even know how to partake in conversations with people. Either I am not interested or I am anxious to provide any details because I am paranoid that any actual small truth will lead to the real me. And that, results into an empty person who can barely hold a conversation or make decisions when people are involved."

Sometimes when I binge, I am not even hungry or even crave the food items. I binge just because something happened that triggers my anxiety and I need to address the anxiety and this generally manifests into a full b/p episode. I'll buy food items without much thought, just as long as it is a lot. I even acknowledge while binging that I don't want to eat, I am not enjoying it but once I start, I can't stop until the whole damn process is over. I keep on bringing myself to read on the consequences of vomiting your food, the heart problems, the possibility of death, but everytime I'm anxious or stepped out of line, I spiraled out of control. I binge and purge and promise myself it is the end but it never is. I don't even believe myself when I make that promise. I'm so exhausted that sometimes i feel that my bones ache. Weird.

depression,f7nk671,t3_dx3vt8,1573907802.0,"I have general anxiety and also anxiety stemming from body issues. I run, obviously, to burn the calories, but lately, I discovered that it is a method for me to appease my anxiety as a whole. I feel like if I push myself, make myself feel tired, feel sore, the physical feeling is significant enough to drown the anxiety momentarily. My anxiety will come back. My fear and disgust over my body will come back too. But in that moment, I feel that I am in control and my problems are solveable. In a way, I can relate to your post on the need to just run. The in the moment feeling is amazing, although I do feel like a fraud when I tell people that I like to run without providing the actual context. Ironic that people assumed I'm healthy and well balanced when in truth I love running for that momentary amnesia from my reality.
