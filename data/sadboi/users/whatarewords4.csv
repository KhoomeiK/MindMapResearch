Xenoblade_Chronicles,fls5iz4,t1_flr8pye,1585434798.0,"Wow thanks! This is super informative. It sounds like the biggest difference then is in combat-related aspects like how it’s done and number of characters and such, but I’m assuming it’s similar in terms of depth of plot/world and investment in graphics? 

I did enjoy battling in XC2, but I think it helps that I didn’t have anything to compare to. XC1 combat style actually sounds pretty fun too, and I think both would have their pros n cons for me at least.

I am honestly a bit disappointed that they altered the art style so heavily, even never having played the original. I think they could have changed it at least more subtly, or just tried to enhance the original style with better details and such instead.

Also, the image link didn’t work for me, but no biggie. (403 forbidden/ no permission?)"
