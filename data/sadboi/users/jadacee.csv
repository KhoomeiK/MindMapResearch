with other things its a little hard to stay on track, like working out and making sure im eating right. ive also been smoking alot to pass the time which isnt always the best idea. 

sometimes im stuck in my apartment with just my thoughts and it causes me to panic and stress out a lot. other times im thankful i dont have to go outside. it really just depends on the day ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
