It helps me fall asleep and doesn't result in any form of hangover for me. The biggest draw back is that because it's a supplement there's not set dose to tell someone to take.

Your description of how sleep is integral and how it feels like you're turning over power to a drug is interesting. My experience has been that melatonin is in no way a knock out drug. In fact, for it to be effective for me, I have to decide that I'm stepping away from the computer and putting my head on the pillow or I can just stay awake after I take it. It's part of a good sleep hygiene routine, it's not a chemical sledgehammer.

Taking the bottle's recommended dose strikes me as low risk, but maybe you could ask your family doctor? You could also put a call into a local pharmacy and you'd probably hear that lots of people take it successfully. It might help you work through your concerns over time.

You are in control. You have the power to take something or not but it sounds like it might take some time to really feel that power. Wishing you the most restful evening possible."

I respect that you're trying to heal yourself, and I know some of the desperation that comes with feelings that intense. 

Can you do something else right now that contributes to living with anxiety? Take out digital library books on skills for coping or Eckhart Tolle? Researching mindfulness might help you in the short term and decide how you want to approach therapy going forward.

You've said that you've seen your mom take and it and you know intellectually it's safe, but your feelings are working against you. I've been there and it sucks.

If anxiety-driven paranoia is getting in the way of taking prescription strength ibuprofen for relief, could you substitute OTC ibuprofen in a smaller dose or an acetaminophen? You might still get effective pain relief. 

I don't know if you have a relationship with a therapist or the prescribing doctor, but you could try this trick with your mom if you don't. Make a plan with her that if you start having a heart attack, you'll go to the hospital. It's something that's worked for me. Then, take a dose. I've done this with medicine where I've believed it was going to hurt me, and knowing that we had an emergency plan helped me take the dose. If there was a therapist involved, I might have texted them saying, I'm taking these meds now, if I really think I'm having ulcers or a heart attack, can I call you in a half hour?
