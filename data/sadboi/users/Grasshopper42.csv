Look, you could only hold that opinion if you have never taken responsibility for anything real. I know the difference because I have been in both places. Before I had my, now 4 year old, I was trying to do the least as possible to get by and I was trying to depend on others and food stamps and whatever to get by. I took responsibility for my childs life and it was scary, I made big changes to my psyche and stopped feeling bad for wanting to make something of myself. From that hippie time of lsd and Phish concerts I learned how to seriously play music and express myself and feel. I am a Reiki master, and had a massage license for a while, just working enough to pay rent.  12 hours a week lol. Now I take care of my family and understand what it is to work for something bigger than myself. They depend on me and it is awesome that I am handling it.

Sometimes (before 2003 i think)  they can have subframe issues and it may need to be reinforced so it doesn't tear when you corner hard. make sure you always use the correct type of oil because there's fine little holes that the oil needs to pass through for the self-adjusting lifters to work correctly. It probably Burns oil so keep an eye on that. if they have not done a suspension refresh you probably at least need to do the control arm bushings, which in that case you should just replace the control arms entirely. I'm 99% sure you can get control arms with pre pressed bushings so you only have to undo a few bolts to put them on.
