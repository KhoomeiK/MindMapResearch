I look at my partner as if we are running a business. We both have to do our part for the business to run smoothly. Now, in our relationship, that means we have certain roles that we stick to that were prediscussed, and we stick to that unless one of us needs help, which happens sometimes and is okay. In our relationship, that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to be the most loving or affectionate person.

I don‚Äôt find it all that weird that your mom was talking to  her boyfriend about what was happening. Perhaps she could have worded it differently, but some people are just blunt. It sounds like she was confiding in her partner in a stressful time in a moms life. 

Also, just Bc OP had only met the boyfriend a few times, doesn‚Äôt mean that mom wasn‚Äôt around the boyfriend more than that.

A relationship is a mutual thing where both people have to be comfortable. Your partner has to respect your unique needs in the same way you respect theirs. 

It‚Äôs okay if you aren‚Äôt there yet. It‚Äôs okay to still be working on yourself. But it does get better with time (if you aren‚Äôt still in a toxic environment).
