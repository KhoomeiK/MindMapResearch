There are better solutions like taking vitamins, exercising, and breathing. But those things are difficult if you don’t want to do them. Medication is an easy fix.”

I laughed as soon as the call ended. She’s young so I’m surprised to hear this attitude from her, but she’s probably one of those “essential oil is a cure” type of people.

UBPD mom had some delusion that I was hiding information from her and had a huge meltdown where she threatened to kill herself in front of my brother who lives with her full time. She said she had nothing to live for if I was dying. I literally just have POTS from mono, and when I had an autoimmune disorder in high school she didn’t take me to the doctor until I was dying from it. So ridiculous.

They didn’t know she was a violent alcoholic behind closed doors. I don’t think any of them ever saw it. The sad thing is even if they did see it, I don’t think they would have believed it anyways.

I have two ex-friends with diagnosed BPD and they cling to each other insanely.

The two of them spend 20+ hours a day together and that was even before quarantine, no kidding. They enable each other’s destructive behaviors like doing drugs and physical violence and tag-team to destroy the lives of anyone who ‘threatens’ their friendship. (Unfortunately, they deemed that person to be me.) They both become extremely manipulative and jealous of each other’s friends and demand constant attention from each other. It’s a toxic cycle I’m glad I escaped from. 

I have noticed in online spaces especially people with BPD and other personality disorders group together to enable each other to not get better and to use their mental illness as an excuse to behave however they want regardless of consequences.

I have learned so much about myself and am able to identify when my different parts take center stage so I can identify when I’m triggered. I can learn why and when each part originated so I can identify triggers for each part. Understanding why I am the way I am I guess also helps me have more compassion for myself, which I struggle with."
CPTSD,fq1suow,t1_fq1039h,1589048806.0,"I don’t know who sent it but I assume it was a prank given that it was sent at 4 am out of nowhere. Now I’m panicking thinking of every interaction I’ve had with people in the last year and I just can’t wrap my head around it, my brain is just latching onto that very small chance that it’s possible. I was just starting to get over my fear of intimacy and now this happens to make me afraid of dating again. People are so fucking careless."
CPTSD,fpzuz0t,t3_gf7sby,1589024052.0,"Omg yes I do this with food, gifts, clothes, and skincare stuff too. I’m so afraid to use something now and regret not having it in the future when I’ll need it. I sometimes won’t even open new books if I’m afraid to tear or rip them, I’ll just sit them on my shelf for a long time. I think that’s why I started thrifting clothes and books because I’m less scared to ruin them since they’re used. I also get very upset when I damage something that can’t easily be fixed and obsess over it so that’s probably where the worry comes from. I’ve heard hoarding is a common symptom of anxiety associated with trauma. I grew up with food scarcity at times due to my parents’ neglect and it really took a toll on me."
CPTSD,fpzt2ho,t3_gg4ago,1589023187.0,"Oh yeah. I have swallowing anxiety surrounding choking and so small things like rice or seeds or chewy things like marshmallows give me anxiety. Certain kinds of alcohol trigger me especially. Tequila, warm beer, bag wine, certain flavors of vodka..."

CPTSD,fpyde5i,t3_gg9ic6,1589001842.0,Also I literally can’t financially afford a meltdown right now lol. I want to fall apart but my bank account says no.
raisedbyborderlines,fpybrlj,t3_gg3u0p,1589000736.0,"I understand this a lot. It can be the result of being a “caretaker” type after having a parent with BPD make *you* be the parent. I have had 2 therapists now say my uBPD mom trained me to survive and navigate her chaos so she could continue using me. Part of my uBPD mom’s parentification was making me learn to deal with adult stress from a young age. I practically raised my younger brother because of her negligence. Cleaning up messes, solving problems, and being a caretaker feels right to me despite how much it hurts me and brings me stress. I do better under duress especially at work and at college. It’s both physically and mentally killing me but I’ll admit it does feel like an addiction after living in a hellish household for years. I feel like I’m filling the void of my uBPD mom with stress and chaos because I don’t know what it feels like to live without it.

It’s a hard cycle to break out of though. To this day, most of my friends call me mom because I’m a caretaker to them. My uBPD mom really isolated me from friendships and relationships so most of the ones I have now mirror the kind of relationship I had with her, which was dysfunctional at best. I am doing Internal Family Systems therapy right now and many of my parts are parent figures that feel trapped; this therapy really has helped me to see the effects of parentification on shaping how I cope with stress and chaos. Learning to be at peace with peace is a constant struggle."
BPDlovedones,fpyaedc,t3_geou4x,1588999704.0,"I really relate and I’m sorry you’re going through this. I currently live with an ex-friend who only disclosed they had a specific BPD diagnosis after we’d moved in and I started to see toxic behavior, and our mutual friend (who I don’t speak to either) also admitted to having a BPD diagnosis and visits nearly 24/7 so they practically live here too. I’ve dealt with a lot of projecting, carelessness of my belongings, messiness, screaming and yelling, having guests over despite me saying no, and blasting music and TV. The best way I’ve found to get along with them is to just ignore them and mind my own business. They lashed out at first and then left me alone when they realized I wouldn’t give them the attention they wanted anymore. I move out tomorrow thank God but I’m not sure I could take their bullshit any longer lol. Headphones, locks on my belongings, and timing when I’m in common spaces so I wasn’t around them was key."
LandlordLove,fpqy0h3,t1_fppqkvi,1588835719.0,Thanks so much! I actually found a similar color of paint in the basement so I’m going to try to cover them up. The walls are pretty busted up and have been clearly painted over dozens of times so I doubt he’ll notice if it’s painted.

excatholic,fpp3omp,t3_ger7f7,1588795407.0,My Catholic religion teacher told me in high school that wearing condoms during sex would prevent the holy spirit from entering the uterus lol
raisedbyborderlines,fpmup9i,t1_fpje3ii,1588742230.0,"Thank you, you’re totally right. I have to remember that withholding truth from her isn’t lying, it’s protecting myself and the people around me. I’m sorry you had a similar experience. I know for me personally it was difficult not having any mother figures in my life to help me through that time. I had to be my own mother and it was so hard. Hugs. <3"
raisedbyborderlines,fpmuhic,t3_gdtxy6,1588742065.0,"6/6. I needed to see this today, thank you. Her lovebombing and my deteriorating memory issues due to disassociating have me sometimes forgetting the fucking hell that she put me through. I forget that I had to survive being her child."
CPTSD,fpj3z16,t1_fpj2j3v,1588655931.0,"I have wondered if I had pure-O OCD after reading about it on here once. That unfortunately sounds exactly like what I’m going through, and you’re right it is pure hell sometimes. My obsessive and intrusive thoughts get out of control to the point where I get suicidal ideations or think I’m “broken” somehow. I’ve done EMDR and DBT with little success. Does medication help with controlling the thoughts? I feel like I sometimes get into nearly psychotic states where I stop being able to tell myself I’m being irrational. I had one the other night after not having one for a while and it terrified me so badly I locked myself in my room and hid under my covers. I hadn’t done anything at all but had a bad nightmare :("
CPTSD,fpiya0v,t3_gdia22,1588651623.0,"Yes. I wish I was more of a pain in the ass. I wish I snuck out, partied, went on dates, skipped class, got piercings and tattoos... My parents didn’t deserve my endless people pleasing and fawning at fucking all. I convinced myself if I was good at everything, then they would have no choice but to love me. Wrong. I just didn’t know at the time that nothing would ever be good enough for them, so I was fighting a losing battle for a decade."
ainbow,fpigydg,t1_fpigf1g,1588640693.0,"You could have requested resources instead of posing this as a debate. You can do your own research if this is for a paper or something. There are plenty of articles, studies, and interviews that you will find with a simple Google search. You will not get any answers by starting an argument, it just invites people with hateful opinions into this space."
ainbow,fpigars,t3_gdnvag,1588640308.0,"Your question is invalidating. Queer identities do not need to be debated, especially on this sub."
raisedbyborderlines,fphrcmv,t3_gdk4hw,1588626395.0,"I’m a caretaker type so I have always had the mindset that there is no giving up or “I can’t” for anything I do, which can be both good and bad depending on what the problem is. I’m really self-reliant and responsible which helps me stay high functioning despite my CPTSD. But the downside is that I get easily frustrated by people who can’t help themselves or who frequently are self-destructive."
raisedbyborderlines,fphcb34,t1_fpg2888,1588618730.0,I’ve tried flowers. She accuses me of trying to poison the cat lol. Some years she’s okay with chocolate and some years she just gives it away to other people and complains I didn’t get her anything useful.

CPTSD,fph8akx,t3_gd20up,1588616727.0,"I feel this. My maladaptive daydreaming and dissociative states are weirdly comforting to me because they keep others out, but they also trap me inside. I’m safe but I’m alone. I feel disconnected from others which I both hate and love at the same time? It’s a hard feeling to grapple with."
