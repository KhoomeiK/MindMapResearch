The only way to see your real screen would be to swipe in a combination of your choice. 

Might be worth you looking up"

Hello, i couldn't help but not message you. This sounds like major warning signs for what's to come if you stay anyway. 

Going through your phone is a warning sign you need to break up with him in a public place with his stuff already packed and brought to him. Maybe a coffee shop or something. 

I stress again all relationships are great in the beginning and they all seem sweet, hence why it's called the honeymoon period but again i stress he has shown a major red flag it starts with asking questions where you been to going through your personal shit. 

Make sure you ask for you key back before you break up and ask friends to be close by without him seeing. 

Be safe x"
