Greed drives a neutral evil person and most are selfish and untrustworthy. However, Neutral Evil people will not commit evil acts unless there is some sort of payoff. 

Conversely as that link states, Chaotic Evil people go out of their way to disrupt law and order and cause chaos *for the sake of chaos* (emphasis mine). Trump *does* cause a lot of chaos, however, based on a character alignment chart, his propensity to cause chaos does not on its own make him chaotic. As you note, chaotic alignment is anarchistic and doesnt value rules and laws. Trump weaponizes these things and from the White House uses ""Law and Order"" as a cudgel to attack his enemies. He may not apply them personally, but the law is his playground. Chaotic people dont sue others, they just retaliate.

What this year? 200k is a reasonable lower bound on a ""2020 SARS-CoV-2 Death projection."" I dont really look to forecast this sort of thing as its not really useful but theres good reason to suggest we will see perhaps significantly more than 200k dead this year.

So [currently the US has counted 90,973 deaths, and is seeing about 1,500 people die a day](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/). We will likely pass 100k deaths next week. This is a *long* way from anything resembling ""over."" 

The projections from IHME (in the link above) suggest we will continue to see <1,000 deaths a day until the second week in July, and that by August we should see about 145,000 deaths directly attributed to SARS-CoV-2.  Thats still a long way from 200k being the ""lower bound"" right?

The good news is that things are beginning to trend down in the US. Though in other nations that trend has been gradual, and considering the sort of inconsistent and hackneyed response the US has made, expect a long ""tail"" on the death rate for a while. This is assuming everything stays ""status quo"" with everything locked down as its been for the past two months or so. Of course, as places begin to reopen, we will likely see some areas have fresh outbreaks, this trend is not strong, and can have its trajectory shifted easily. That variable is kinda impossible to project around. From an Epidemiological perspective this is a dangerous and critical inflection point in the story of how SARS-CoV-2 plays out in the US. If cases spike again, lockdowns will be the order to control it. Will people listen? How much of an 'uptick' in death should we expect as a result? Everyone is bracing for that answer.

This is still only talking about ""through August."" We still dont know if we will see a stronger wave in the Fall/Winter, but the consensus view is that we should definitely expect it, and the available models suggest it will be more severe. If people cannot keep social distancing practices, the remaining 4 months of the year may see a LOT more death than the past 2 months."

For drugs in special circumstances, the FDA will ""Fast Track"" them, allowing them to make some assumptions and meet a lower threshold for ""effective"". These drugs still generally take 6 years or more to complete their trial endpoints. 

The reason these take so long is in part because of some of the risks you identify. Every drug will have potential side effects. Every drug will have potential long-term side effects. They may include some really undesirable things. We can still put these drugs out. At the very *least*, before a drug can be administered, we have to have *some* idea of what those effects are. We need to make an informed decision about the effectiveness of the treatment and the potential risks involved. Without knowing what those risks are, that is not possible. So even *identifying* which folks should and should *not* get this vaccine, requires testing. This is why the expectation is 18-24 months, because even *that* would be a world record in drug development. 

In the past eyebrows raised globally as China's FDA had been approving drugs in record time of 3-4 years. There have been ongoing questions about how they're accomplishing this safely. It may be that China has shared some miracle drug testing methodology, but that's less likely than ""China's been cutting corners and has either gotten very, very lucky, or is good at keeping a lid on the fallout...""

So what is the US doing thinking it will have a vaccine in 18-24 months? Its an aggressive timeline. I mean, we can make a new influenza vaccine very quickly, but that's because we know the pathogen so well and we've been making them so long, its like the grilled cheese sandwich of vaccines. Some coronaviruses have been challenging to develop vaccines for, which is why several of them are lumped under the ""common cold"" umbrella (along with rhinoviruses), as things that no one has bothered trying to cure, because they're hard. But things have moved quickly here because the world is on alert. The companies involved have appeared highly confident, despite the high failure rate of new therapies. So we shall see.

COVID19,fqur2x9,t1_fquhmxf,1589663286.0,"In general the, clinical trials process from start to finish takes several years. You can see the general breakdown of what happens at each phase, and how long they take [here](https://www.healthline.com/health/clinical-trial-phases#phase-ii) 

Some therapies (like any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, will) qualify for FDA's Fast Track status, which allows for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review of these therapies. [Here](https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/accelerated-approval) the FDA outlines the way approval is accelerated. Its can be dense so i'll try to summarize below.

Usually Phase II and III can take several years, as we need to see that the subjects are not having adverse events as a reaction to the drug, and the dosing is not only safe for humans, but effective in the primary endpoint goal of inoculation. 

For fast tracked Phase III trials, we've set some additional targets. Targets that say, ""hey if we see these kind of results, it indicates things are going the right direction, and this *probably* is working as we expect."" So we don't wait as long to make sure this vaccine doesn't also make you susceptible to other infections, or doesn't cause some weird unexpected overwhelming cytokine response or some other thing, we just see that it looks like its ""good enough"" and we send it out, following up with more safety trials later.

Essentially, the more we rush to market, the more blind we are about what we're doing. We need to weigh the balance of ""how effective is this?"" with ""how risky is this?"" Even fast tracked drugs can be withdrawn if its shown that the clincal benefit does not justify the risks associated with it. 

If you look [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm) you can see some side effects for other vaccines, and while many are relatively benign, some, like the Yellow Fever vaccine comes with a handy warning of ""Life-threatening severe illness with organ dysfunction or failure""

There is no real way to set a date on how long this will take. It will take as long as it takes. Every trial phase results in a lot of data that needs to be considered before moving to the next phase, or may scrap the remainder of the process. For example, if its determined your vaccine inactivates the virus, great, but in figuring out the right dosing you start seeing people get any adverse side effects, and the only safe dosing isnt enough to provide immunity, then it may be back to the drawing board. This sort of determination just takes time."

How soon can we get it, and will it be covered by insurance (because of course I have insurance), and what will the out of pocket be, and how self righteous and smug can I be on Facebook after I get it?""*

I see a storm coming."
MurderedByWords,fqu044o,t1_fqtyxzl,1589649432.0,"Neither are necessary. My entire point is that while its easy to lash out verbally, its not productive, and there are alternatives to the false choice of 'verbal violence' or 'physical violence'. We may not, as a society avail ourselves of any of the more rational options, but the options are there, and can save more lives than either the verbal abuse, or the ""guns will fix it"" options. How about tens of thousands *less* dying because we decided to help people find reason rather than laugh at them through shitty memes?"
MurderedByWords,fqtzbva,t1_fqttwul,1589648998.0,"Don't worry, we'll probably see it more. This was a fresh comment and people dont always sort by 'rising' or however you may read reddit, and this comment was not in /r/MurderedByWords. As a result, people will see this comment and and then check here to see if its been posted before, but some will not. Those that do, will have seen this thread, and won't bother reposting it. Those that dont check, certainly won't see this comment. Because this behavior pattern exists across all subreddits, and because crossposting is easier or screencapping and data anonymizing is already more work, changing this behavior is unlikely. Voicing this frustration will not be effective in reducing the frequency of reposting. Ever. Its easier to ignore it and move on than it is to respond. Ironically as I have done here, at length."
