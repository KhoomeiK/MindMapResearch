Drugs,fhz1ni0,t3_f59gud,1581988810.0,Bro if you’ve never done it before I’d say it’s possible to stay awake 24-36 hours off of one dose but that’s mostly if the meth is definitely high purity. If it’s cut meth it could range anywhere from 4-12 hours I’d guess.
bipolar,fhxstm4,t3_f5asc6,1581961538.0,"I have bipolar as well bro. First off, I’m so sorry you deal with bipolar bc absolutely no one deserves that. Secondly, there’s only one drug that’s been medically documented to my knowledge that causes actual bipolar. That drug is methamphetamine and isn’t caused by mushrooms at all just so you know. I have put a decent amount of research before into if I caused my bipolar by using drugs too. I can say with almost absolute certainty mushrooms never ever would cause bipolar to surface or develop in a person."
treedibles,fhxqq2y,t3_f5amxu,1581960269.0,I’ve bought edibles from medical dispensaries here that were labeled sativa or indica before. Personally I can’t tell a difference between those different edibles but on the bright side you’ll still get high as long as they’re good edibles. I think edibles feel more closer to an indica’s effects rather than a sativa.
oilpen,fhxn7w1,t3_f5182x,1581958114.0,I’m just guessing here but I’d say you shouldn’t have any issues if you stored it in a cool and dark place. I can’t think of any reason why it’d go bad even after leaving it alone for a year I’d say. I’d confidently hit that cart after pretty much any amount of time you’d set it aside.
oilpen,fhxmoob,t1_fhw8dyr,1581957783.0,Ehh I’d respectfully disagree with you tbh based on personal experience. I’d say if your tolerance is WAY up there then it’ll take a whole month for a full tolerance reset. After that month waiting any longer will help you forget the high more and more like you said. I think after a month you can get pretty close to feeling like you have zero tolerance again. But if you really want to have a significantly intense high like the first time you smoked then I’d say it’d take 3 months to get all the magic back when you smoke again. I’ve taken plenty of tolerance breaks in my time smoking and I’ve never felt like 2 weeks could completely reset me before.
Drugs,fhx9ig8,t3_f3rsng,1581948744.0,Depends on your friends imo. I have one friend in particular that he and I have this unspoken rule that we always got each other’s back if the other is out of bud. Most times I pick up I’m picking up more bud than I’d get for just myself. I typically factor in that I’ll be sharing some usually each time. I’d say it shouldn’t be an issue unless you’re feeling taken advantage of for your generosity specifically. Tbh no ones gonna have a solid enough answer for you and I’d say bc it’s ultimately just personal preference on your part you shouldn’t be concerned really.
Drugs,fhvs3gh,t1_fhon9mg,1581900647.0,Bro I realized while hitting the nitrous like a fiend once before that in that moment I actually craved something (the nitrous) more than I had ever craved breathing oxygen before in my life. Nitrous kinda scares me bc it’s one of the only drugs that’s made me care more about staying high than fucking continuing to breathe in to stay alive. Like nothing has ever made such a substantial essential bodily function feel so much less important than it ever should be.

Drugs,fhviiv4,t3_f4d24d,1581897760.0,"I went on a 6 month bender after someone broke up with me in a fucked up way. During those 6 months I was sober for maybe 72 hours total that whole time. I didn’t stick to one drug either. Tolerance to drugs is the enemy when you’re on a solid bender. So I would alternate between different classes of drugs. Opioids, benzos, stims, psychedelics, dissos, and I also went pretty heavy on the cannabis concentrates. Basically I took a drug class until it felt like my tolerance built up too much and then I’d switch it up to something else that was up next after that drug. Obviously there was still a tolerance build up with everything I was taking but I think I greatly minimized how much it actually built up. I definitely don’t recommend doing this bc the mental breakdown I experienced at the end of those 6 months was quite literally unbearable and filled with constant suicidal ideation. Getting relatively used to being sober again after all that and it was a difficult task to take on to say the least. Thank god all that isn’t going on in my life anymore. Constantly needing to be inebriated before during my bender just to feel like I could keep on surviving through the life I’m stuck here living gets really exhausting. No matter how carefully you dose out your shit and you’re high constantly for months nonstop then you’ll inevitably loose control of your emotions or sanity at least somewhat."

Drugs,fhtnr9i,t3_f4azis,1581876191.0,"Just to add onto other comments already, I’d say you definitely didn’t relapse. You didn’t take meth, and that was the problem drug right? You didn’t count it as a relapse when you drank or smoked weed after getting clean. I’d say according to your logic you’ve stated clean. Now there are plenty of people in recovery that would say you did relapse but don’t focus on that rn I’d say. I’d try to be focusing on the fact you still haven’t touched meth again (good fucking job btw). Two years off of meth is no easy task. I think the guilt you’re feeling has to do with how similar mdma is to meth effects-wise. Mdma isn’t the same drug tho and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for having fun and letting loose. Nothing wrong with that. If you truly think the mdma was a bad decision for you to take then I’d say just avoid it from now on. But my main point is I think you’re doing a great job in recovery and there’s no need to stress over this"

Drugs,fhszd06,t3_f4g5g0,1581867758.0,"Bro I used to occasionally do the pressed perc 30’s occasionally like every 2-3 months or so. Never was an issue before. Then semi-recently I went pretty heavy on the meth for like 2-3 months. After I took a break from the meth I seriously felt like I needed something else to help me stay off it. I did the percs more often after taking a break from the meth. I always snorted them but eventually started to smoke them on foil like my dealer did. After snorting all the meth before and then snorting the percs my nose needed a break badly. So I made the mistake of smoking them. I still don’t believe how much it effected me psychologically after that point. I became obsessed with them, more or less, after that. I started to sell stuff of mine I normally wouldn’t ever sell. Thankfully I’ve put them down, hopefully forever, and I don’t plan on doing them ever again. I’m not even that big of a opioid fan tbh but smoking fentanyl grabbed ahold of me so profoundly and significantly and I honestly won’t ever be quite the same after feeling that particular high. It’d be nice to feel that way all the time but I knew I had (thankfully) stopped these lil devils right before the WD started to settle in too badly for me. If I had gotten dopesick after my little pill bender here I honestly might not have been able to stay off them for this long and without relapsing since then. 

I’ve been seriously dopesick before and it’s just the fucking worst thing man. I’m praying the initial WD doesn’t last long, and that you are able to make it through this no matter how hard it is.  I’ve made it through some seriously tough times that were caused by my drug usage and the most important thing to remind yourself is the pain is only temporary. There will be an end to all this. Just push through. You got this."
Drugs,fhsvdwf,t3_f4qpb3,1581865947.0,"Cotton mouth that’s cannabis related isn’t caused by the smoke. It’s an actual side effect of THC in your body. How do I know this? Bc I’ve dabbed, vaped flower, and taken edibles and I’ve gotten cotton mouth from each of them and no smoke was inhaled any of those times. 

I haven’t used the specific oral rinse you’re talking about but I’ve tried something I suspect is quite similar which is a mouthwash designed for people with dry mouth. It increases your saliva production I think bc after using this mouthwash you’ll have almost too much saliva instead of too little in your mouth. 

On a random side note that’s barely related, the best thing for cotton mouth was smoking the Amanita Muscaria’s cap’s skin. Idk why but it increases your salivation after smoking the tiniest bit of the mushroom. I loved smoking the mushroom’s skin combined with weed. There was a lovely synergy between those two."
Drugs,fhstxnn,t3_f4gc28,1581865326.0,"I realized that drugs have allowed me to stay comfortable with wherever I’m at over the years.

I’ve stayed stuck in basically the same place for years now and I’m just now realizing that I’ve done hardly anything at all to make my life better or more worth living.

opiates,fhsrghu,t3_f4egl7,1581864427.0,"Ime, having done a decent amount of pressed fentanyl pills on purpose many times before, I’d say fentanyl can definitely be euphoric or it can make you feel like you described. I think it all depends on the specific analogue you have in your shit, bc different analogues of fentanyl can feel so different from each other. I’ve noticed certain batches of shit I get have the good fent in it and others have the shitty kind. Totally random which ones which and no way to tell unless you send your shit to an actual testing lab."

No major euphoria. More cardiotoxic than most other commonly known stims too if I remember right. I can spend a decent chunk of my money on coke all in one night basically, or I could buy literally any other drug I like even more and those other drugs would last me 2-10 days getting high for same amount I’d spend on the coke for a night. I’m left feeling much more satisfied than I ever could after coke by doing almost any other drug. Even weed or nicotine has historically left me more content after buying them more than I ever could be after buying coke. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll never turn down free coke but I think I’ve actually purchased it myself a grand total of like 3-5 times ever. I’ve done tons of coke before tho. It’s just never as satisfying or worth it unless it’s free basically imho."

Stims,fhsca71,t3_f4ofbq,1581858537.0,"This doesn’t work for every drug (but works well for most hard drugs ime) but here’s what I do when I’m in your shoes. 

You have to be pretty good at reading people and also will probably need to go to a sketchier part of town to have the most success. The type of person you’re looking for is most likely gonna be homeless, and you want a specific kind. They should look like they do drugs obviously (so you’d look around for a tweaker), look like they aren’t too “far gone” (a super hardcore addict, as apposed to just a regular user, who’s also homeless will be much more likely to try to steal from you), look like they got their side hustles in order (they’ve figured out a way to get their money, semi consistently, to get their drugs, food, etc. most days it seems despite having no job or income), and look like they got the hookup for the good good drugs (probably the hardest one to figure out. I look for things like cigarettes, drinks, or whatever and I see if they got the cheapest one or got a pricier specific kind. Basically, if they spend any extra money on things they care about besides getting the cheapest one then there’s a better chance they care about their drug’s quality too. This isn’t as helpful but I feel like you can just tell this quality about a person in your gut mostly. You should get a pretty good potential sense of their drug’s quality after talking to them for 5-ish minutes.) 

Ok so you’ve found your homeless homie. Start up a conversation. Most people out on their own like that hardly have people look them in the eyes, let alone talk to them. Ask how they’re doing. Start to get to know them. This next part is crucial (idk why it’s so important but this technique works best when you do this part), take out a cigarette to smoke yourself and immediately offer one, for free, to your new friend. While you’re both smoking your cigs, and they’ll be super happy to get a cigarette, establish that you use drugs as well. For example when I’m looking to score some meth I’ll say something like, “Man I’m pretty bummed out since this morning. I was supposed to get some adderall from my plug earlier today but they fell through. I mean I’d rather do G (it’s slang for meth here, it’s short for ‘Glass’) but I can’t find any good shit around here very easily.” It’s casual enough to not feel forced, it establishes you use drugs, and opens the convo up to discussing finding/scoring other drugs. Hopefully they are happy with just the cigarette or two you give them but sometimes if they’re gonna help you out then you’ll have you help them out some too. Never immediately offer to do this, but sometimes you have to buy drugs for both yourself and your homeless buddy for this to work. Personally, I’ve never really had to pay extra for them and I think it’s bc I try really hard to be super friendly, nonjudgmental, and compassionate at the beginning of each conversation. Ime most people who do hard drugs will help another user find shit if that person is just nice, treats them like just another human being, and you’re generous towards them without any provocation on their part. The only other thing I’d add is it’s really important to establish and prove that you do drugs yourself. Just feel out the convo and talk about things that other users will recognize (like talk about your fav ROA for your shit, maybe it’s side effects, symptoms of withdrawal, or something only other users would generally know). 


Don’t let go of your money until that good good shit is right in front of you. This may be obvious but don’t give them the money unless they’re in the process of handing you your drugs. If they ask you to follow them to get your shit it’s advisable to just stay where you are, but I’ve followed a select few people to nearby motel rooms, apartments, etc. and nothing sketchy happened and I got hooked up. 


Best case scenario: your new friend introduces you or takes you to their plug. 

Worst possible case scenario: you have an awkward conversation with a homeless person who can’t help you and you’ve lost a cigarette. 

If they can’t hook you up with a plug, sometimes I can still buy a bit of their own personal stash off of the person still. If this this happens expect to pay slightly more money then the amount you get is worth. I’ve been able to buy off of random people’s personal stashes plenty of times before and it’s almost easier to just buy their own shit off them right then instead of going to the trouble of getting to that new plug. Its just much less risk then traveling somewhere you’ve never been to before rather than just getting what you can from them in the moment. 

Is this all a little risky? Sure. But finding any drugs in general is inherently dangerous anyways. There will be risk regardless of what you do. I can’t ask any friends for their plugs for the harder drugs bc I’m pretty much the only one left who does them still. Plus I don’t want most people knowing I do any drugs (besides like weed). So my options are basically what I’ve written here. I don’t do this much anymore but this technique has helped me countless times before."

Stims,fad8qud,t3_e8mglj,1575959671.0,"Well I’d say adderall is a decent stim that, when dosed properly (your personal “sweet spot”), can be quite recreational and is relatively safer than meth. Propylhexadrine is a structural analog of methamphetamine (according to psychonautwiki) (Having tried both I can say meth and propylhexedrine are quite different tho ftr but there’s also some noticeable similarities). Don’t do meth. I’m just saying definitely don’t do it if anyone possiblys  suggests meth bc of it’s similarity to propylhexedrine. 

So yeah adderall is a great option imo that’s relatively safe. Vyvanse can be fun as well but I’ve only tried it once so I can’t vouch for it a ton. If you can drop some decent money you could get enough cocaine to last the whole weekend. Tbh I think coke is overrated. It’s only sort of worth doing if it’s a very high purity. 

Keep in mind this is just my opinion. Some will disagree with me possibly. But I think these are solid options.

I think another part of it is the “we know this is really really bad for our health but we continue to do it.” Theres the shared addiction and similar coping mechanism there. When I smoked cigs and went outside to smoke, at a bar or work, and met another smoker there was almost always a connection there before we even really talked.

Stims,f9yab43,t3_e7djnr,1575725855.0,"I prefer to have friends that are drug users in general. Not just stimulant users. Stoners, psychonauts, coke heads, tweakers, bartards, or opiate users/addicts, I’ve been friends with em all at some point. I feel like I relate to users more than most other people. We understand parts of life that others just don’t understand and tbh can’t understand. Like having the knowledge that: simply ingesting a certain chemical can just completely change your emotional/psychological state, or escaping from life’s troubles (at least mentally) for a period of time is completely possible with a little money and knowing the right people. 

As far as meeting other users (and there are tons of druggies out there, it’s just inherently kept hidden bc of its legality), I just start off by casually mentioning cannabis use (if they seem like they’re cool and not just a goodie goodie). If cannabis is something they’re into then it’s way easier to bring up other drugs. Maybe bring up psychedelics next? Or prescription pills like Xanax, or vyvanse? I just carefully ease into finding out if they dabble with anything harder. You gotta be a good “people reader”. Once you mention something they’re uncomfortable with it’s hard to recover from it usually. 

Also sometimes I’ll say things at work in the smokers area like “God I wish I had some adderall. Work would go by so easily.” Or “Thank god there was no drug test when I was hired haha!” Plenty of options for meeting other users. You just gotta use your head and get creative. Obviously you gotta be careful depending on the kind of job you have. I’m in retail and they don’t drug test all new hires. So it’s safe to assume that there’s an increased chance my coworkers are using drugs too imo. Another thing I’ll say (but only after I’ve established to someone that I’ve tried many different kinds of drugs already) is something along the lines of “Yeah but I’ve also tried some drugs I probably shouldn’t have.” Tbh most people will reveal their former drug use if I say this. But still others will admit that they have done the same (meaning they tried a drug they probably shouldn’t have) and said that they still occasionally use. 

Obviously these suggestions for meeting others can cause problems if the situation turns sour. But you can’t find other users without a little risk imho and ime."

Stims,f9fcb4c,t1_f9fbq0z,1575266165.0,Remember it’s only gay if you actually like the meth
Stims,f9fbofm,t1_f9fbke6,1575265519.0,Live trip report in this bitch! All or nothing
Stims,f9fbhx8,t1_f9fbdz6,1575265338.0,Tell me again when you spun enough and decided to do it afterwards how I was right
Stims,f9fbc4q,t1_f9f773s,1575265177.0,"You ain’t a real boofer until you’ve boofed somewhere in public. Butt chug kratom in a room full of people and tell me it isn’t the most euphoric experience of your entire life.  /s 

Lol sorry I’m stoned and starting to come down."
Stims,f9f73vm,t1_f9f7068,1575261349.0,Thanks for the suggestion but I’m not interested in this ROA. Don’t need my meth high any more recreational than it is! Anymore would quickly become problematic
Stims,f9cmulo,t1_f9cmojp,1575225374.0,I’m looking into making several harm reduction purchases next couple paychecks and that is definitely high up on my list.
Stims,f9ckiwf,t1_f9cj3mr,1575224758.0,"Much appreciated I’ll look into those metered dosage inhalers. Never even heard of those tbh. And one of the main reasons I’m looking into a nasal spray is to minimize damage to my nose. I’ve snorted so much shit (not just meth either. Done my fair share of pills, coke, etc up the nose too) that it seems I’m left with a permanent (with occasional relief) case of the sniffles regardless if I’ve snorted anything recently or take a break for my nose. Time to start taking care of myself and be safer with any insufflated drugs from now on."
researchchemicals,f9167r1,t1_f90mvq2,1574983081.0,Thx for the concern man! Definitely a very strict rule I follow for myself is never any needles. Glad you got your shit together after IVing became problematic. Hope you’re doing well :)
DreadAlert,f8zb7vs,t3_e2xbwz,1574959222.0,"The massive amount of work you’re putting into this is incredible! I’d just like to personally say thank you (and if you’re celebrating at all, happy thanksgiving) to you and the other site admins that care enough help our community so much!

researchchemicals,f8uij02,t1_f8uighn,1574830564.0,Sprinkled 5mg of what? I’m guessing baking soda?
researchchemicals,f8uh5xs,t1_f8ueb7o,1574829302.0,What was your process for freebasing your 3-meo-pcp?
researchchemicals,f8uh4m4,t1_f8ub8xi,1574829269.0,"My reasoning behind wanting to vape/smoke it is faster onset. I love snorting my drugs but I’ve read it can take between 1-2 hours-ish for the pcp analogues to kick in after insufflation. That seems kinda disappointing to me tbh. I like the quick onset snorting generally provides with most drugs. Not ever interested in IVing any drug (nothing against it, it’s just a personal rule for myself)."
researchchemicals,f8ugm7e,t1_f8ueui0,1574828816.0,True totally agree. I was also leaning towards the ammonia technique bc it seemed like it’d be less likely to leave extra byproduct if too much ammonia was used. Whereas it would be more difficult to use the correct amount of baking soda  with the 3-ho-pcp I’d imagine.
researchchemicals,f8udygg,t1_f8udhpq,1574826527.0,I’ve read that freebasing coke specifically with baking soda results with a less pure product than ammonia produces. That’s the logic going into it.
researchchemicals,f8ud6ic,t1_f8ua5kr,1574825874.0,Using some chems would fuck up your coils in your vape. Depends on a lot of factors tho. I’ve never been interested in using coke in a ejuice form. Just concerned with pcp analogues.
researchchemicals,f8ua0db,t1_f8u9thj,1574823326.0,Oh I see. Tbh I’ve read mixed reviews on lacing ejuice with various chems. Generally I’d say you’re right about the appeal of e-cigarettes as a helpful ROA. I just don’t want the 3-ho-pcp to degrade at all so I’m just trying to be safe I guess.
researchchemicals,f8u9hqu,t1_f8u6wvi,1574822917.0,Isn’t pcp commonly smoked in cigarettes tho?
researchchemicals,f8u9g38,t1_f8u98zf,1574822879.0,Well with cocaine I’m quite certain you have to freebase it before vaping/smoking it. That is well known online I’d say. PCP itself is commonly freebased and cigs are laced with it. If the pcp is in the hcl salt form it isn’t smoked/vaped effectively.
researchchemicals,f8u8u53,t1_f8u6wvi,1574822401.0,Could you provide a source please?
researchchemicals,f8u8tv1,t1_f8tzgpe,1574822395.0,Could you provide a source please?
researchchemicals,f8u8rf2,t1_f8tzdjy,1574822343.0,Not necessarily but I’m quite certain it needs to be freebased to not degrade as a chemical when it’s exposed to hotter temperatures.
Stims,f8memuh,t1_f8md553,1574630620.0,This [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FADQ/comments/azikg1/dangers_of_dental_anesthetics_in_combination_with/) explains it pretty well I’d say tbh
Stims,f8md4v3,t3_e14631,1574630236.0,I found out Satan uses reddit today and his username is u/Cumdumpster71 lmao /s
Stims,f8mcfw2,t1_f8m8pmm,1574630117.0,Meth definitely has potentially fatal interactions with anesthesia as well. Tbh I’m not sure about regular amphetamine specifically
Stims,f8k90dv,t1_f8in2ev,1574608718.0,As a pansexual guy I may be biased but prostate orgasms are so fucking great. Add any drug to the mix and it gets even better.
Stims,f8k5alj,t3_e0ygv4,1574607566.0,"“Commonly prescribed antidepressants such as SSRIs can inhibit CYP2D6, which can in turn increase serum concentrations and side effects of amphetamines.9,34 Second, amphetamines can increase serotonin release and inhibit reuptake; concurrent use of amphetamines with SSRIs can lead to dangerously high extracellular serotonin levels (serotonin syndrome).” 


Literally just typed “amphetamines SSRI” on google and found this on the first page.

Edit: coke is overrated I agree. Fuck caffeine, I consider it to be a shitty stimulant and hardly even worth comparing to the others here. Amphetamine is the best drug out of the three imho. But this is ultimately just personal preference. Amphetamine is typically cheaper, longer lasting, more euphoric, more functional, has more ROA options, and can be redosed more often with less negatives than cocaine ever could be. 

Serotonin syndrome is pretty serious usually and even if theres not enough of an interaction to medically warrant any concern it would still likely be quite uncomfortable if you got close enough to serotonin syndrome. Either get another med prescribed that’s not a potentially dangerous mix with amphetamines or don’t do amphetamines at all yet. Also SSRIs can have lasting effects up to 14 days I’ve read. Waiting a full 15-16 days after discontinuing the SSRI would be long enough before safely using any speed-paste/amphetamine."

Stims,f8gvxv5,t1_f8ghdzo,1574565896.0,I’m really comfortable with psychedelic experiences imo. Plus I want a more intense experience than what I’ve read mdma alone can offer
Stims,f8gh95b,t1_f8ggzvf,1574559671.0,That candyflip I’m planning on will be my first time using mdma. But I’m pretty sure just mdma would disappoint me bc of it’s shorter duration. And I don’t have enough to redose with it either sadly.
Stims,f8gge9u,t1_f8g4use,1574559320.0,Lol I’m gonna wait to candyflip until I can buy adequate amounts of weed/shatter and nitrous hopefully first. So it’ll just be my weed and meth this weekend. But that’s still a great fucking weekend.

Stims,f8dzg0p,t1_f8dzc6q,1574514455.0,I’m just so happy lol. I had to share! I’ve been working a new retail job and the hours are way more than I’m used to unfortunately. But it’s nice to see my hard work pay for this.
