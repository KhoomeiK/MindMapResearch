Especially over something as trivial as bedtime.

Only problem is that I don’t. I’m 25 and I know people who are actually talented, they have nothing in common with me. I only learned this by going to a top school and realizing I had nothing on any of these kids.  My mom told herself I was special and forced me to believe that too. But it wasn’t true.

Kind of a bummer looking back and realizing YouTube taught you to shave cause your dad was never around. When you count the economics, it’s insane. Most of my friends came from upper middle class families and had money. They legitimately do not understand what it is like to just have a little less, let alone what actual impoverished people go through. It gets really old having friends ask me why I don’t have a car when their parents bought them theirs. None of them had to have part time jobs in college. None of them had to have part time jobs for their “fun money” PERIOD. A lot of them still benefit greatly from their parents (full disclosure, my mother helps with things too, like medical bills).

Favorite beer on draft? A appetizer to snack on? Maybe a small batch bourbon that’s only local to the area or some shit like that. Can they tell me the history of the establishment? Seriously, some of these places are 100 years old and got stories to tell. If I make it clear I am a tourist, do they have suggestions on things to see/visit? And keep in mind, the only person making anything up when it comes to tips is you. We have nothing to do with that. We do the job and do it well for everyone. I make a point of not picking up the checkbook until the table has left. If it’s a good tip cool, if not, that’s life. Don’t get defensive just because the US has a tipping culture, nobody is forcing you to leave a tip."
TrueOffMyChest,fe6n80g,t1_fe6k6a4,1578896757.0,"It’s because there is certainly service involved, but 5 minutes opposed to 45-60. It’s not executing the tasks exactly as instructed, it’s doing all that and being a host for EVERYONE (doesn’t matter if it’s not your section) in the restaurant. You’re the tables go-to for everything from the second they sit in your section to the time they exit the parking lot. Seriously, if you see a cell phone left behind, you run that out to the parking lot to see if they are still there before leaving. That’s why sit-down restaurants have a stronger tipping culture than fast food. I am in no way opposed to tipping fast food workers, and I highly encourage it. If you can pack care and knowledge of the menu into that five minutes, maybe give me a favorite of yours too, that’s excellent service. Service is service regardless of time."

intermittentfasting,fe01ra1,t1_fdxkc26,1578800919.0,Well thanks for making my family wonder why I am laughing in the bathroom. Best masturbation joke this whole thread lol
intermittentfasting,fe01cj2,t1_fdzxj13,1578800647.0,There’s an intermittent fasting subreddit you should check out. Good info on what I assume OP was doing
whitepeoplegifs,fdq9get,t1_fdp92ze,1578660179.0,"I remember this song being such a big deal when it came out. I thought it was super interesting, and cool. The video was eye grabbing and powerful. Then I tried just listening to the song. The song is boring as fuck without the video. It’s not a bad song, but when it relies so heavily on its video to be interesting... it’s definitely not a great song."

NarcissisticAbuse,fdq603i,t3_empc05,1578656382.0,This post is so right. I need to cut out my father for good this time. It’s just difficult. I need to do it though
massachusetts,fdq3ut3,t1_fdotpl1,1578653564.0,"Grew up in MA, moved to CO right after MA legalized. When store bought ounces cost more then what I used to buy on the street, there’s a serious problem. It’s absurd. We have a few illegal states around us who all have citizens that would be willing to come here for their bud. We should be pulling in tons of cash from this. But there’s no point in buying overpriced bud when all the street dealers we know and love are still here lol. They’re making a killing while brick and mortar stores can’t keep up. Without competition, the stores will never get better."
unpopularopinion,fdnwrip,t3_em3xxm,1578594417.0,"I’m on the fence. I am a huge stoner, daily smoker, but people don’t get that vibe from me. Most people are surprised to find out I even smoke at all. In that regard, I kinda treat weed the way religion should be treated. Practice as much as you want in private, be quiet about it in public. But damn the people who have to show off how much of a huge stoner they are suck lol"
politics,fdknnqb,t1_fdjtueb,1578507342.0,"I have insurance, but somehow I still ended up paying over $100 to go to a clinic. Not a hospital, not a doctors office, but a nurse practitioner at a fucking Walgreens. Not that $100 will make or break me. But when you have insurance you shouldn’t have to pay $100 for a thermometer that confirms what we already knew (I was running a fever) and to get some ibuprofen/ other over the counter items. The whole reason I had to drag my sick ass over there anyways was to get a note to be sick from work. If I hadn’t gone to the clinic, my options were go to work sick, or lose my job. I work in food service by the way. Anybody going out to eat during flu season, I can almost guarantee your food has been handled by at least one person with the cold or the flu because they couldn’t get out of work. Been in restaurants for 9 years, it’s the same story everywhere. Employees unable to go to a doctor, so they come in sick as hell and get everyone else sick. All out of fear of losing their jobs."
dating_advice,fdkli7z,t1_fdkg3mg,1578506026.0,"You misunderstood my post. I don’t lie to myself when I feel terrible, or when bad things happen. At least for me, you can’t lie to yourself. You lie to the people around you so they don’t abandon you. You hide your real emotions to protect your relationships. I know somebody else in this thread said that if you have to do that, they aren’t your real friends/family. Which is true, but I can’t afford to lose more people in my life, I am already lonely enough as it is."
dating_advice,fdizog4,t1_fdhyr1u,1578454765.0,"Great perspective lol, and it’s true. Some acquaintances of mine thought I was too negative when going through a rough patch. Needless to say they are not really parts of my life anymore. People in pain need support systems, not someone trying to take them down a notch for having feelings."
dating_advice,fdizfof,t1_fdhrhkx,1578454599.0,How so?
dating_advice,fdids8r,t1_fdhvvu5,1578440618.0,"No, thank you. People act like I am crazy for pointing out that people with extreme depression don’t want to be that way. It’s like saying someone with cancer chose that. It’s just abysmally wrong and hurtful. Thank you for keeping an open mind to other’s perspectives, even if you don’t agree with them. You can’t really disagree until you’ve tried to empathize and get what they are feeling."
dating_advice,fdhq2th,t1_fdhpa1c,1578427923.0,"You literally don’t understand what you are talking about. And I hate to admit I was on a different page too. What you are describing is a narcissist, not a depressed person. And sorry dude, but your messages are written from a place of ignorance. I can sense you’re getting upset with these messages, so probably best to let this conversation go"
dating_advice,fdhp6rv,t1_fdhmowk,1578427390.0,"There is not a positive outlook in everything. There is a lot of good, but there is not positivity in everything. That’s just being disingenuous when you say things like that. It’s a complete lie."
dating_advice,fdhn6kd,t1_fdhkbya,1578426198.0,"I am not doing any of that lol, I am just trying to point out that your attitude towards depressed people and people who got a hard hand in life is incredibly toxic. In fact it’s borderline offensive. So what if someone talks about sad things all day? It literally might be all they know. By calling them names, and blaming them for “being negative” all you are doing is in fact making the situation worse. I had a friend who was so depressed it honestly got annoying. But I never stopped talking to them, I never belittled them, and I never acted like what they were saying was inaccurate. I just did my best to be open, and I am not going to fight someone and act like their situation is better than they say it is, it would honestly be nicer to just slap them in the face. Who am I to judge? Who am I to say you’re wrong? Who am I to say you’re not trying hard enough to be happy? This person saw a therapist every week. This person was a talented artist who dumped their pain and anguish into their art. This person hanged themselves about seven years ago because for some people, it’s actually incredibly difficult to feel just okay. A lot of people liked to call her a Debbie Downer. A lot of people insisted she wasn’t trying hard enough to be positive. After medication, therapy, psyche wards, and whatever else she did, what else can someone do? There aren’t a lot of options (psychedelics, ketamine treatments were not options at this point). Then you still have to deal with people putting the blame on you and acting like you don’t want to be better. What I am pointing out, is that the way you talk about people going through hardship, depression, extreme pain, whatever, wreaks of ignorance. You sound like the type of person to ask a rape victim what they were wearing. Some people really do not have the ability to feel good. It’s not okay to belittle these people and call them “Debbie downers”.  “There are a lot of pessimists that work really hard to be miserable”, this is such an unbelievable fucked up mentality. So you personally have met every depressed person? This is like saying “every poor person wants to be homeless”. It’s victim blaming and nothing else. All I am trying to point out is that your attitude towards people in extreme pain is almost as toxic as the pain these people are going through."
dating_advice,fdhja1p,t1_fdhirxp,1578423832.0,"It sounds like you have a huge bias to just assume people are Debbie downers when they just talk about life the way it is. Some things are good, some things are bad. If I talk about a negative thing in life, it does not make me a Debbie downer. But it always seems like there is always some jackass that wants to discredit what other people have to say. So they demean them with names and act like their perspective is not as valid. It’s a bully tactic, and a great way to get depressed people to feel worse about themselves and ultimately stop talking to people all together."
dating_advice,fdhibrg,t1_fdhham3,1578423253.0,"Without being condescending, can you give me a reason why my answer is a “debbie downer” answer? Why are painful things less valid than positive? What is there to be gained by hiding things you would rather not focus on? In fact there is a huge argument that facing adversity is a good thing. So why is treating a “negative” answer with the same validity as a “positive” answer a Debby downer/bad thing to do?"
