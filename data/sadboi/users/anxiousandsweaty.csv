mentalhealth,f0o6rdy,t1_f0mj7r0,1568798616.0,"I would look at cutting down on coffee (maybe try to switch 1 or 2 of those mugs for decaf to start with), and increasing your exercise. Don't set a difficult goal like a daily run, but maybe something more manageable like 3 runs a week, or to walk or run daily. This way you don't get defeated (I didn't run today so I failed) or it gives you an easier out if you don't feel like running (you could go for a walk around town or something).

These are things that would make someone more tired, but it's a different kind of tired. You will probably sleep better and deeper after more exercise and less stimulants, and eventually wake up feeling more rested.

Exercise is also great for depression in many cases, and might help you feel a lot fresher in the head and give you back some of the motivation that you've been missing.

Good luck!

Edit: I know someone below has said more coffee, and for one day that could work and give you a boost. But if you're tired after 4 mugs it probably isn't having much of an effect anyway. Cutting down will lower your tolerance, and it will gradually have a stronger effect again. Sleeping when you're full of caffeine (those 4 mugs a day mean caffeine is always in your system) is possible but the quality of sleep is not good."

But if it happens when I'm out or with people it will usually last until I'm out of whatever situation I'm in.

If it's in an office for example, I will often end up leaving to go to the bathroom, or anywhere I can be alone for a few minutes which helps calm down. Usually after that, I can return to where I was and be calmer after the 'attack' has gone away.

Maybe one thing to look into is a different system for you to keep track of what you need to do, deadlines, etc., so you can feel a bit more on top of some areas of your life, to take some pressure off of others.

Another piece of advice I have, which is easy to say but I greatly appreciate is not possible for many people, is to take some time off.

Hyperhidrosis,f03t83o,t3_d3lxgc,1568369306.0,"Great job and transformation, congrats for not letting HH stop you from improving yourself! I love exercise because its one time when you can get really sweaty and it not be 'weird'.

Have you been doing anything to manage the HH? And have you found being more fit reduced it? Presumably yes because more self confidence = less anxiety = less HH = less anxiety about sweating... I guess its hard to know if its the fitness or confidence."
Anxiety,f03ml9a,t3_d3joyo,1568360813.0,"You're not a failure for leaving an exploitative workplace. That's braver than staying there to be used. Well done for leaving, hopefully you can find somewhere that you're treated with more respect."

[https://www.medicaldaily.com/life-hack-sleep-4-7-8-breathing-exercise-will-supposedly-put-you-sleep-just-60-332122](https://www.medicaldaily.com/life-hack-sleep-4-7-8-breathing-exercise-will-supposedly-put-you-sleep-just-60-332122)

Interestingly, there was a BBC programme on anxiety with someone famous, can't remember who, and she was talking with a therapist about what she does when she experiences an anxiety or panic attack. This basically involved a breathing exercise like you linked. 

The therapist asked her to do the breathing and show him, and as she did it she ended up having a panic attack. What they discussed was that because the breathing was linked in her mind to trying to traumatic times and panic attacks in the past, by doing it she was actually making her attacks worse not better!

I'm not saying not to do the breathing exercise, but this was just an interesting case where it was actually doing more harm than good!"
Hyperhidrosis,f03m2tr,t1_f02yiv3,1568360205.0,Have you tried high strength antiperspirants for the armpit sweating?
Hyperhidrosis,f03lyza,t3_d3kt7u,1568360080.0,"Yes, I'll assume you're talking about underarms: generally you'll need to apply it every night for a week or so before noticing a reduction. But because it makes skin very sensitive and itchy, and because the armpit naturally has a lot of friction, this is the (only, in my experience) place where the skin gets most red, and can result in a rash. 

My advice is apply it as often as you can, but stop if the skin gets red or inflamed. It's a strong chemical and this is your skin reacting to it. But over time the reaction will be lessened. If you go past this point and keep applying you risk a rash and the skin getting broken, and this will prevent you applying for a lot longer (trust me you don't want to apply this stuff to broken skin!). 

It will take a lot of applications at first, but slow down when your skin is telling you to. Eventually it will kick in and then you'll just need to do 'maintenance' every week, month, or longer depending on your personal situation."
mentalhealth,f03lpkq,t3_d3jk7z,1568359773.0,">My sister occasionally will send me stuff about how exercise is the best thing for depression when it's proven that exercise only relieves minor depression, not MDD. While it does help me a little my overall mood is still meh.

It really is worth increasing your exercise if you can though. I understand its difficult, I've been there. Even if it only has a small effect on depression, over time it will lead to a healthier body and a healthier mind. I thought the effects of exercise were comparable to taking antidepressants(?), so even if it isn't a cure, any improvement is worth trying for.

Anecdotally, I know a few people with depression/anxiety ranging from mild to major who found improvements in some form or another when they started running.

I can't offer advice on anything else you mentioned and I'm sorry you're going through it all, just wanted to highlight that its really worth trying to exercise more."
mentalhealth,f03l57u,t1_f02ue7p,1568359124.0,"Thanks for such a detailed response, it's interesting to hear more about how it can have a positive benefit, some of which I knew but good to read another perspective."
Anxiety,f03l0bm,t1_f00sqjg,1568358965.0,Are you me? It's amazing how so many of us are affected in similar ways.
Hyperhidrosis,f02196t,t3_d2wzpl,1568321771.0,"I have a pack but only used once so far. I used in the morning and noticed it working by the afternoon. It also seemed like the effect lasted through the next day too (but wore off after that). Did you notice it had a longer effect than oral glyco?

Applying at night is a good suggestion, I'll give it a try, thanks!"
Anxiety,f01zxes,t1_f01eik9,1568321215.0,"Yeah it's expensive :( How much were you taking each day? I found I need about 25-50 mg to feel much of an effect, which works out quite costly and I'm not sure the benefit is enough for the cost."
Hyperhidrosis,f016ks5,t1_f00vvod,1568311042.0,All this is great advice!
Hyperhidrosis,f0145t6,t3_d3bc1a,1568310219.0,"I find the same, sweat a load but don't smell. If you stay clean, then when you sweat it likely won't be smelly!"
Hyperhidrosis,f013ywu,t3_d3avz7,1568310157.0,"It is just advice that you can find online, there's nothing new, and there's no miracle. If you search you'll find the pdf. It's also an ebook originally written by someone else. All in all it's a scam, and you'll see from time to time people posting here telling you its got the miracle cure in and to just buy it and find out."
Hyperhidrosis,f00vvi8,t1_f00uqp0,1568307165.0,"That sounds about right, with most people it starts happening around the teens/late teens, probably hormone/puberty/development related. And fyi, full honesty, it doesn't really go away on its own in most cases. But now you know, you can work out how best to deal with it, good luck!"
Hyperhidrosis,f00vf9b,t3_d2xwhl,1568306992.0,"Does sound like HH. For some people it is highly localised, typically hands. For others its full body, usually with some focal points. (Interestingly, in my experience and from some other people's that I've read, those with it all over often don't have it bad on their hands, which is weird but one saving grace I guess).

The most accessible treatment is getting a high strength antiperspirant like driclor, odaban, drysol etc. which you apply at night and then wash off in the morning. Look into them as a first port of call."
Anxiety,f00use3,t3_d371xe,1568306738.0,"Yes! And (less so now) I always got an intense heart pounding whenever I stuck my hand up, and even just thinking about putting my hand up. I was sure people sat next to me would be able to see my shirt moving because of my heart beating 😂

Edit: I know its easier said than done, but try to get involved more, and if you do it with smaller things, the anxiety barrier will be lower but you'll get yourself more used to speaking in front of people and the worry about being wrong or whatever will gradually get less and less."
Anxiety,f00ugch,t3_d380s5,1568306607.0,"Yes, and the anxiety usually means a loss of appetite and dry mouth which means not wanting to eat, which makes the stomach problems worse. I recently have been forcing myself to eat breakfast at the start of a anxious day (like an interview) because its easy not to eat, but getting something will stave off the stomach problems and give you some much needed energy. 

The key is finding something small you can eat to get your appetite going."
Hyperhidrosis,f00u3x8,t3_d38nkz,1568306471.0,"How long has it been going on for? 

Sounds like hyperhidrosis but if its suddenly appeared its worth talking to your doctor. But   
 you'll find a lot of useful advice if you have a nose around the subreddit. Main things to look into that work or help for a lot of people are: improving your overall health through a better diet (and avoiding trigger foods like coffee) and exercise, using high strength antiperspirants (they have a lot of aluminium chloride in them, around 15%), and glycopyrrolate which comes as a pill and works on the whole body, or as a wipe you can apply to specific areas, both of which your doctor might be able to prescribe.

But welcome, hope you find some useful information here and can get on top of it."
