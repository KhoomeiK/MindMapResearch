astrology,fqxo3rs,t3_glgpnz,1589735294.0,Hmmm i think open enemies is actually 6th house. This may be more of a traditional astrology standpoint though. But i think it makes more sense especially if 6th house represents house of bad fortune (and i think 12th is house of bad spirit). Try looking at your chart from this standpoint and see if the placements may resonate more.

The candida diet says no fruit, but i can eat fruit because it doesn‚Äôt case flare ups. Processed foods and simple sugars cause flare ups for me. Its also a good idea to stay away from fruits that are high in sugar like banana and mango. At least for the first few weeks. I don‚Äôt eat meat so my anti candida diet consists of fruits and veggies. Sometimes ill make wild rice. Its tough and this what feels like my 1,243rd time trying it because i always slip up at my 2nd-3rd week mark. Ill eat a pastry and boom, vaginal yeast infection. It really sucks but its necessary if we want to live yeast free lives. I seriously feel like guys have it so much easier. Because if I didn‚Äôt have a vagina, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be in so much discomfort. Good luck!
