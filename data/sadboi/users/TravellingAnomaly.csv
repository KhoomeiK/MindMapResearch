It's totally fine to want distance when you feel drained.I don't think she herself realizes that it's draining you since she's probably in such a negative headspace where she just needs to let it all out ,but it seems like simply her doing that isn't help with improving her coping skills to prevent herself from getting to that dark place.Perhaps therapy might be a better way for her to learn the tools that may ease her situation,so that even with her not complaining towards you,she still has an outlet so she doesn't bottle in all her feelings and dig deeper into her headspace."

You aren't being over dramatic at all!If you were,instead of letting things slide you would've went berserk on him.

I think it's best to address this problem to him and if all works out,boundaries are established.(A simple no means no should suffice)He should love you enough to respect and abide by them.You're a human being that deserves respect and no one should ever treat you otherwise."
