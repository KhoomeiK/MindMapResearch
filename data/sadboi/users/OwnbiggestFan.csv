unpopularopinion,fphm89l,t3_gdeckw,1588623753.0,It is a false equivalency.  Girls may clown on a guy for being small or finishing fast or even make up stories about a guy being those things.  But a male who sleeps around is also called a slut by some and men can be harassed and catcalled as well.  If a guy makes fun of a girl for having certain nipples or if their boobs are not symetrical or having protruding labia that would be like talking about their dick.  And being bad in bed can go both ways.  For many reasons.  I would say calling a girl a dead lay is similar to saying a guy is a minute man.  But saying someone has a small dick or that they are a minute man too their face or via electronic device could technically be sexual harassment while calling a woman a slut or catcalling her is almost always sexual harassment.

mentalhealth,fofe64c,t3_g6zh1d,1587733848.0,"I tell people that I see things in dimensions and from many perspectives.  I imagine how things can go wrong on a spectrum and how they could go right on a spectrum.  What is tough for me is seeing things going as planned not wrong or right just normal if you will.  I also have paranoia which I am aware of so I can reality check it but what I imagine seems very real.  I catch every nuance and microexpression in others body language and words.  I read people deeply as a protective mechanism and I have to constantly remind myself that the World does not revolve around me even though my own world does.  My World is all I have.  I can empathize but it is still through my own personal filter of experiences and analysis of life.  And the thing is my paranoia is sometimes spot on which makes me wary of other people and their motives which always comes back to me as I am aware of projection and I analyze myself to see if that is what I am doing.  When I am depressed I think of all of the things I could not accomplish or the impulsive things I have done that sabotaged me in the long run.  I think of how my anxiety from a young age crippled me as I was hyper-sensitive of what other thought of me when I just wanted to be accepted if not be seen as extraordinary.  When I come out or depression I think of the times I was extraordinary in my mind and the fun times I have had and I wonder if I will ever have fun again like I have had.  Aging is tough for me to deal with and at 45 I have to resign myself to the reality that this is it for me and I will never accomplish what I wanted to in life.  I cannot hold a job.  I cannot foster healthy relationships consistently and I do not fit in with society.  I am always am outsider who, at times, can function at a very high level but who is overall low functioning.  I am not able to buy into the seriousness that others apply to their lives as far as their careers and families go.  I love very deeply and feel connected to the universe and am capable of making deep connections with other humans but it is the normal connections that I do not make very well.  I was able to be a good, single father as my daughter was born when I was 19 but I was not able to give her a traditional family her Mom and Step-dad did for awhile.  I do find myself being bitter about having had the added anxiety socially and otherwise that I got from my mental illness.  The paranoia and the attempts at people pleasing and being held back by fear for most of my life.  And I also have keen memories of the glimpses I had at being who I set out to be and more even but it was always fleeting and then interrupted by a relapse into my mental illness and into my own head. I was able to marry but only briefly.  I have had many failed romantic relationships and at this point I do not think I can go through another one.  I am able to be grateful for the people who have stayed with me.  My parents, my brothers, a few friends.  I also find myself withdrawing more and more as I age and I have to admit that I feel like I love my cat more than anything in the World.  I also feel most connected to her.  I know I love my daughter and I am grateful she is not afflicted.  I love my family and honestly I love all humans while I also fear for the future of all of us.  Why do we hurt each other and why do we leave each other and how can you be indifferent to someone you once loved so deeply.  Who I still love deeply.  The pangs of nostalgia can bring me to tears while the passing of an old friend does not.  I only learned to control my emotions 6 years ago.  Before that my amygdala was driving my ship.  Emotions would cloud logic and impulses would be indulged in order to soothe my brain for the short term.  My higher levels of executive function could not stay on the same page so my thoughts and my life remained disorganized.  I can regress terribly and it is distressing to not be able to consistently keep my life organized.  It can feel like a huge chore just to pay my bills on time even when I have the means and to make appointments.  I make plans and find myself wanting to not follow through with them when it comes time.  I can also get lost in my head for long periods of time and am known to go weeks not leaving my apartment other than to throw trash and get my mail.  I know I do best on a schedule but my sleep has been off for 2 years this time and so I do not keep a normal schedule.  It used to be up at 6 am.  Eat breakfast and watch the news and read my paper.  At 7:30 I would go to the gym and do 30 minutes of treadmill and 30 on the elliptical.  I would come home and shower and then do my household chores like picking up, cleaning, laundry, cleaning my car, and going through my emails.  I would then eat lunch at 11:30 and read or surf the web until I worked at 2:00.  I worked part-time from 2 to 8:30 Tuesday and Thursday and 5 to 8:30 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  I worked every other Saturday 11 to 2.  After work I would relax and watch television or visit a friend.  I would come home by 10 and read or something until midnight.  I took my meds at 11 pm and would be asleep by 12.  But I lost my job after 10 years.  I went through a divorce.  I stopped going to the gym.  I stopped sleeping from 12 to 6 and I stopped taking my meds consistently.  I do get injections now.  I am going to get a gym membership when it opens back up.  It is across the street.  I am working with Vocational Rehabilitation to get back to work.  I am lucky to have Social Security Disability and a nice rent controlled apartment on the 4th floor of a locked building.  And I have a good support system.  I just get restless and I struggle with the state of my life as I want to be able to do more.  I have a degree I only used for a few years and I have not worked since July of 2017.  I did do a month long work assessment and it went well."

AmItheAsshole,fodly40,t3_g6qw2f,1587686331.0,The worked for a Wireless provider my first job out of college.  It was in 1997 and 1998.  I was a Senior Customer Service Representative based on me sales for a small town store and I would meet people from corporate along the way.  The manager who hired me and I were close and I was and he moved me from outside sales to inside sales and we worked closely together on inventory control and sending paperwork to the regional office.  After 18 months working together he left and bought a radio station and the new sales manager was a Senior sales representative who had a lot of corporate accounts.  She made more money in sales.  I had made a connection at corporate who helped me to quickly and fairly solve customer service issues.  It would usually take an email and that was that.  My new boss found out about this and put a stop to it and later fired me and put in her own guy.  I knew the CEO who had given me an award one quarter but I never C'C'd him on anything that reflected badly on someone else.  Only on positive things like compliments from customers and numbers from sales contests.  If I had an issue with a co-worker I handled it myself and helped them fix the problem.  Usually this was them having lied about coverage or a customer was overwhelmed by their first bill.  I am pretty sure that if I had C'C'd the CEO or even the regional sales manager on an issue with a co-worker they would tell my manager to tell me to cut it out.  This is tantamount to tattle tailing.
