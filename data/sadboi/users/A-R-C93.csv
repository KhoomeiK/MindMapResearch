drunk,es1ii9e,t3_c59pcj,1561497595.0,Lol that's a telltale sigh that she's a keeper!
relationship_advice,es0v1ae,t3_c561jz,1561483586.0,Well although that's a good reason not to tell them because then sides would be taken and some would urge to leave her etc.. But think about certain situations where ur having issues in the future (not like cheating issues) but lets say out of sync with each other u cant really vent to ur family/friends about things without bringing up some part of her cheating (its inevitable) then they would be shell shocked asking questions and you would have to go over all of it again but its ultimately up to you if u decide to tell them I do believe you should get tell your families and friends  together so nobody is blindsided or certain details are neither downplayed or blown out of proportion ur both there and its all one big fuck story (keywords are ONE STORY)
