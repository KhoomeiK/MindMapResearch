therapy,fl5hhy4,t3_fmljgn,1584836839.0,When my psychologist retired he had me write a few paragraphs about the big stuff from my past to give to my new therapist. It was nice for her to have a head start & know what she‚Äôs dealing with even if I‚Äôm not ready to discuss it all yet.
selfimprovement,fkmb65z,t3_fjb4x1,1584324857.0,My husband has stopped this lifelong habit too. Well done!
EatingDisorders,fkif8cs,t3_fifqok,1584218605.0,My husband & daughter are home for a month which means I can't binge all day like I usually do while they are at school. I am so thankful for this because I've been unbelievably out of control & didn't know a way out. This may really save me.
depressionregimens,fjhy7ek,t1_fjhdos6,1583357245.0,Thanks so much for this. I think I could actually give it a good try. I feel the way you did when I try to say I love myself. What crap. But being able to accept positive parts of myself would be nice.

disability,finzc20,t3_f8scqw,1582573231.0,"Just sending love to all the DAC out there! Ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of getting married. Not for a wedding (no, thanks), but to change my last name (long-ish explanation). Now that‚Äôll never happen due to that damn marriage thing.

I‚Äôve been with my ‚Äúhusband‚Äù for 15 years. We have a 13 year old daughter. I used to be so upset by this but have learned there is no changing it so I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. They like to tease me & call me a ‚Äúkid-dult‚Äù."
TalkTherapy,fi18osp,t1_fi0hq26,1582052844.0,"Yes, the ‚ÄòHey! Just change your thinking!‚Äô is so frustrating. I was lucky enough to have a great psychologist for 3-4 years (and many nurse practitioners & therapists in the past 10 years before that) who hand picked a perfect new therapist for me within the Mental Health Center when he retired.

She‚Äôs great. A woman, about my age, past addiction & mental health problems. I can almost tell her anything. We are slowly dipping our toes in EMDR. I feel hopeful."

BingeEatingDisorder,fgua13h,t3_f0flqz,1581115842.0,"I started taking it for BED, too, but it isn‚Äôt helping very much. I still obsess over food & binge if I‚Äôm home alone. I‚Äôm on 50mg so can still stand another dose increase or two.

One thing it has done is allow me to sleep through the night, every night. I had a huge problem of waking up & eating in the middle of the night so at least I‚Äôm not doing that anymore.

Good luck! I hope it works for you!"
EMDR,fgu2u96,t3_f0gg33,1581112561.0,I do alternate hand tapping on my thighs. I like to be able to make no eye contact while I talk through the memories.
EMDR,fdhrfwm,t1_fdds7i4,1578428719.0,Thanks so much for this reply. I definitely don‚Äôt feel like much of anything happened with that single session. I was hoping that it didn‚Äôt mean I was doing the whole thing wrong. Now I have hope!
EMDR,fdhr2gg,t1_fdbthxy,1578428503.0,This makes sense. All my problems go back to me being worthless & not deserving of love.

I have lots of mental health disorders, Bipolar type 1 being the biggest & it wrecked so much of my adult life. I need to work through being ok with things I‚Äôve experienced & done.

Thanks for your response!"

I was even able to laugh with my 70 year old psychologist who eventually retired. He was awesome. Therapy is so much better when you get breaks from the serious stuff.
Anger,fa177bw,t3_e7m165,1575765669.0,"I have problems with this. Even if I know I should apologize, it really hard to do. My husband is an elementary school teacher & tells me how to properly apologize. State what it is that you are apologizing for instead of just saying ‚Äòsorry‚Äô."
EMDR,f9n5jwp,t1_f9m4rrl,1575477468.0,Thanks for the reassurance. I really love the idea of a house. It doesn‚Äôt feel quite so overwhelming.
EMDR,f9n5cw3,t1_f9l01w4,1575477349.0,"Thanks for the tip! We talked about a safe place & I really couldn‚Äôt come up with one. She eventually suggested my bed which I agreed to & sounded fine at the time, but I have memories of an abusive ex who beat the shit outta me for breathing too loud in bed & also maybe being raped while I was sleeping. I still feel weird saying that & really don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs rape."
EMDR,f9n50l9,t1_f9ktn1k,1575477137.0,I knew I had a lot to process. I‚Äôve been in therapy for 13 years & I feel like I‚Äôm finally doing the nitty gritty work. The majority of those 13 years seems like I was just trying to survive with all my diagnoses.
EMDR,f9n4qns,t1_f9kqr7g,1575476967.0,Thanks so much for this! I love the idea of a house with different rooms. It doesn‚Äôt feel so full now. The emotional pain is spread out but easily contained.

I see my psychiatrist on Friday & expect him to raise the dose. I‚Äôve had such high hopes for this med."

Fast forward to age 17: my parents divorce. I had to move far away from the small town I grew up in & didn‚Äôt get to experience Senior Year with all my friends I went all through school with. It was shitty. We had recently watched a movie about a girl with an ED Health class & I just thought I‚Äôd try it.

Fast forward to age 38: Stupid fucking ED really screwed things up. I wish I never would have tried it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù & have weighed anywhere from 95lbs-160lbs. History of Anorexia, Bulimia, & I just today was prescribed Vyvanse for Binge Eating Disorder.

Wish me luck!"
BingeEatingDisorder,f48gtys,t3_dii3mu,1571438954.0,"I just saw my psychiatrist this morning & asked if I could try Vyvanse. He is starting me at 30mg.

I have Bipolar 1 Disorder, Generalized & Social Anxiety Disorders, OCD, Eating Disorders, & Dependent Personality Disorder. I‚Äôve been in treatment for 13 years. I‚Äôve had an eating disorder the longest of all my disorders. 21 very long years.

Currently on Lamictal, Trileptal, Luvox, & Clozapine. Recently out of a nearly two years long mixed episode. It feels so good to make it out of that but the stupid ED just won‚Äôt let me win. I‚Äôm really looking forward to trying the Vyvanse. I‚Äôve never taken a stimulant before & am really curious to see what it does."
