I have issues showing people new music or tv shows I enjoy because I worry they won’t like it and will judge me. I always start with “if you don’t like it let me know and I’ll change it”. Even with my girlfriend, she says she is fine watching the tv shows I enjoy, but I get to anxious watching them with her to enjoy them myself"
ActualWomen,fqerrk9,t3_gi3gff,1589312518.0,"Hi

I saw someone already directed you to [r/latebloomerlesbians](https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/).  And it’s pretty amazing to see how many woman go through a similar problem. Many woman on there have debated for years (including myself) if they were asexual, bisexual or gay, which reading the [master doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT3f5IIzt5PG-M7G9_Z-gjY4gZaiUneTdMlYrFAcdBGcJo0-N-RDQcj2JfxOaBTxKa6J_DiDQNgqVpg/pub) helped a lot of them.  Here’s also a cool [video](https://youtu.be/Nl_Ja4_7Rfo) of a YouTubed going through a similar problem as well that I really enjoyed. 

If you are serious about giving polyamory a try, then there are many books that help you navigate that path seriously, such as More than Two and The Ethical Slut. 

However, I suggest you take some time to think this through. I don’t want to scare you but this is going to change things for you. Since you have a crush on this girl, feelings will arise and it will be very different than what you have been dealing with (just your husband sleeping with others). 
Whether it’s that you want to explore this with your husband by your side or going solo, you’re going to think a lot through. 

Don’t beat yourself up for not knowing. I grew up in a liberal area and I had no clue I was a lesbian until later in life. But remember that your exploration affects your husband too. And if your husband is an amazing person, then you need to consider his feelings too and if it’s worth holding onto him “just in case” it doesn’t work out. 

Good luck!"

Now as for finding an everyday job to pay the bills. She should be willing to do that. Most entrepreneurs need a side job when they start out. Many are not fortunate enough to have a partner support them. However, now is a difficult time to do that due to the virus. Very few people are hiring and many are trying to find a job due to high unemployment. Some are hiring (grocery stores, cvs/Walgreens) and if she is willing to work through the virus, then there are things she can do. And while it’s not the most amazing, this is the time we live in.
