AnorexiaNervosa,fled7wt,t3_foc7k8,1585082134.0,People say don't drink your calories because some overeat and dont recognize they're full from drinks. Personally I've never had a problem with it and normally I count my calories anyway so theres not really any risk of me overeating.

fasting,fk5zcnc,t1_fk5y5ql,1583890695.0,Everything food wise was super gross to me until I forced myself to eat some watermelon and now I'm hungry. I haven't had another vomiting or nausea episode since then but wouldn't be that surprised if I did. I've fasted alot before and this stuff has never happened (apart from when I drink to much which I figured was probably gastritis)so I'm just a little confused. Will restart in a few days and see if it happens again. Thanks.
