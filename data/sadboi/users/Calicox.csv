FigureSkating,fljbq0m,t3_fp0i42,1585205868.0,"Right now, the best thing you can do is off-ice conditioning. Here’s what I’ve been doing. 

Flexibility. I’m basically targeting every muscle in my body right now because I’m as stiff as a board, but more specifically, I’m targeting my hamstrings, inner thighs, groin muscles, hips, back, and shoulders. Flexibility in these places are needed to preform spins and spirals if that’s something you want to do. Yoga helps with this, there are a lot of good stretching videos online. I wish I could give you recommendations, but I’ve been so busy lately. I do a few toe touches and lunges, then flake to do homework haha. 

Strength. Of course, you don’t want to be a weak noodle, but I think the most important parts to strengthen would be your core and legs. A strong core helps with balance and power. When/If you decide to do jumps, a strong core is needed to achieve the tightness needed to do those rotations. Strong legs are good for pushing in general, but those are also needed when it comes to jumping. Even if you don’t plan to jump, it’s always nice to get stronger.

Minor things... You can practice whatever you can remember as if you were on ice. Watch videos and copy them for refreshers. Improve balance. Practice shifting weight. Practice positioning your body. Those last two are things I have trouble with and it makes moving much more strenuous sometimes. 

Hope that helped! I need to get more on top of my conditioning myself :("

I’m still breaking into my skates in since I have the wackiest feet ever, but I recommend taking a short break every half hour or so to just sit down, shake your feet a bit, rub it and try to bring it back to life, then put them back into your boots whenever you’re ready and go back on ice.

I had two more questions actually if you don’t mind. 

A) Now that we got the idea that skates need to be stored with soakers through my head, where do you personally keep your skates? I was thinking about placing it in a storage box with cloth lining, but I’m just worried it’ll turn out that you can’t do that either. 

B) Are creases in (new) skates normal? I’m not sure if creases affect the lifespan of skates or if they’re abnormal, but I just noticed creases along the bottom of the tongue.

What I’ll do if I ever happen to make it to any level higher is up in the air for now. It’s not much, but I hope that helped you out a bit more. 

Thank you kindly for your advice though. Are there any particular basics that you think people generally forget to focus on? For example, maybe people ignore the importance of actually learning to crossover and as a result [...] or something like that. Everything’s important of course, but surely there must be a specific thing that deserves just a bit more attention?"

I can’t compete in the Olympics anymore like I wanted, but that we’re a lot more well off, I can start taking lessons. 

I really wish my parents forced me to do a lot of things as a kid too, because I find myself in classes with toddlers that are basically prodigies nowadays. Anyhow, I’m not too discouraged :’) I’d like to continue taking lessons regardless and see where that takes me; it’ll be cool to pull a few tricks from my sleeves with friends that have never ice skated before lol.

Good luck with your lessons!! Which skates did you get?"

But I feel like I'm constantly searching for an excuse to try to be rational with myself. But I can't help it, I'm paranoid. I would go back into days, weeks, months, even years' old conversations to compare the past with the present. 

""They used to respond every minute to every five minutes here. They haven't respond in a week. I'm giving them time. Well, maybe it's because we're in college now. Yeah that's it. But last week they respond every hour or so . . . ""

I'd think of the circumstances and why their response time was that and why theirs was this this time around. I would log onto all of my other social media that I haven't checked in a while just to see if he's online texting other friends, or playing videos games, have they been on reddit lately, where are they right now? Maybe they're busy . . . 

And I try so hard to make some excuse for them and try to be rational with myself, but -- I've learnt that it's often what I'm expecting. I can't help, but be pessimistic and paranoid, it's just always the same ending. I don't know what to do and I can't let go of these habits because I'm so scared that it'll hurt more once the walls are knocked down.

EDIT: And I'd also obsessively check the time too. Watch it go from one minute, to an hour, to a day, to a week . . . just hopelessly waiting and not wanting to spam their inbox with texts or they'll think I'm crazy, clingy, or hopeless. I wish they could see how hard I'm trying to hold back those urges and not seem ""BPD"", I'm trying so hard right now."
BPD,fb2mnmq,t3_eaea34,1576453823.0,"Same. I can be rational, but I choose to be irrational. It feels like a survival instinct, I need it. I need it or else somebody will deceive me, people are horrible and I need to be vigilant to prevent it. 

“They don’t text back? Maybe they’re busy, after all it’s finals week, or maybe they’re driving, or maybe they’re enjoying their time alone — or maybe they’re deliberately ignoring you because they actually don’t want to talk to you. Yeah, that must it. It must be it. Let’s see if they’re online. Let’s see if they messaged their favorite friend. They’re messaging their favorite friend. They hate you. It’s not because they’re busy. They don’t care about you. You almost tricked yourself. They’re not busy. They say they’re not busy, they’re NOT busy. People are horrible.“

“I’ll text you back in a bit” and not getting a response for a day while they’re consistently texting somebody else ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ What else can you do? 

I’m trying to be rational about it, but I’m honestly so tired of trying. It’s like trying to trick myself. I’m hoping every hour is the last hour of waiting, but it never isn’t. There’s so much I would do, say, whenever they respond — but as soon as they respond, it just all melts away and I suppress everything I want to scream to them. Can’t they see how hard I’m trying to be “normal” for them and not obsessive, attention-wanting, bpd-like? Idk."

It’s like I need something to trigger my intense emotions to survive, it’s the only way I know how to live almost. 

I find myself crushing on people often and I’m very into them until I realize they are as well. Unrequited love or a taken love breaks me — shatters me to pieces —, but I cannot love somebody that loves me the same way they do.

2) Something I can tolerate and enjoy doing
3) Something that is not my passion or creative outlet

Truth is? I honestly don’t know. I just found myself enjoy reading medical journals, webpages about diseases, psychology, helping ill patients, etc. and I just kind of figured: “I guess I want something health related.” 

Over time, I learned that I wouldn’t be a good doctor or surgeon. I was too squeamish and can’t tolerate being something intimate like a physician/therapist/psychologist. Over time, I learned that I really just liked reading about diseases, learning how we might be able to cure them, how we could try to cure them, and spending time in the lab. A few more of these cycles and I eventually ended up with the final outcome of biomedical engineering(it might change by college) after some Google searches.
