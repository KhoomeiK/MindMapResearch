FigureSkating,fljbq0m,t3_fp0i42,1585205868.0,"Right now, the best thing you can do is off-ice conditioning. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing. 

Flexibility. I‚Äôm basically targeting every muscle in my body right now because I‚Äôm as stiff as a board, but more specifically, I‚Äôm targeting my hamstrings, inner thighs, groin muscles, hips, back, and shoulders. Flexibility in these places are needed to preform spins and spirals if that‚Äôs something you want to do. Yoga helps with this, there are a lot of good stretching videos online. I wish I could give you recommendations, but I‚Äôve been so busy lately. I do a few toe touches and lunges, then flake to do homework haha. 

Strength. Of course, you don‚Äôt want to be a weak noodle, but I think the most important parts to strengthen would be your core and legs. A strong core helps with balance and power. When/If you decide to do jumps, a strong core is needed to achieve the tightness needed to do those rotations. Strong legs are good for pushing in general, but those are also needed when it comes to jumping. Even if you don‚Äôt plan to jump, it‚Äôs always nice to get stronger.

Minor things... You can practice whatever you can remember as if you were on ice. Watch videos and copy them for refreshers. Improve balance. Practice shifting weight. Practice positioning your body. Those last two are things I have trouble with and it makes moving much more strenuous sometimes. 

Hope that helped! I need to get more on top of my conditioning myself :("

As a beginner, I don‚Äôt know much brands other than the well-known Edea and Jackson Ultima brands.

But I feel like I'm constantly searching for an excuse to try to be rational with myself. But I can't help it, I'm paranoid. I would go back into days, weeks, months, even years' old conversations to compare the past with the present. 

""They used to respond every minute to every five minutes here. They haven't respond in a week. I'm giving them time. Well, maybe it's because we're in college now. Yeah that's it. But last week they respond every hour or so . . . ""

I'd think of the circumstances and why their response time was that and why theirs was this this time around. I would log onto all of my other social media that I haven't checked in a while just to see if he's online texting other friends, or playing videos games, have they been on reddit lately, where are they right now? Maybe they're busy . . . 

And I try so hard to make some excuse for them and try to be rational with myself, but -- I've learnt that it's often what I'm expecting. I can't help, but be pessimistic and paranoid, it's just always the same ending. I don't know what to do and I can't let go of these habits because I'm so scared that it'll hurt more once the walls are knocked down.

EDIT: And I'd also obsessively check the time too. Watch it go from one minute, to an hour, to a day, to a week . . . just hopelessly waiting and not wanting to spam their inbox with texts or they'll think I'm crazy, clingy, or hopeless. I wish they could see how hard I'm trying to hold back those urges and not seem ""BPD"", I'm trying so hard right now."
