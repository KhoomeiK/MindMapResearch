This has been my biggest gripe that doesn't directly concern the virus through this process. Yes, this virus is BAD. Yes, there have been far too many deaths and there will continue to be far too many in the coming months. But the way that so many news outlets and people in general have handled things has effectively ruined the trust I can put in news and people whom I originally deemed to be trustworthy. I live in a small state, and while we have actually done a very good job of preventing the overcrowding of hospitals and effectively being able to care better for our citizens, the constant blatant lies that these people come up with for attention and the unethical local and national news actions has really rubbed me a way I can't ever really recover from."

My thoughts behind the Jones pick centered strongly around Incognito's age and the fact that I didn't see too much value here outside of other positions of need, which centered around WR (Jeudy taken already), safety (Jon Abram and Lamarcus Joyner remain), corner (Jones to me is more valuable than Noah I. and Diggs) and inside linebacker (Jones to me is more valuable of a pick in a league where the trenches dominate and a need will open up soon than Queen, Murray etc at this spot).

Pick: Lakers -6 @ Grizzlies (8:00 PM EST) 

Excited to get the ball rolling here with my first POTD! Here we have a really juicy line with the Lakers a 6 point favorite at Memphis. The Lakers are potentially going to be missing LeBron in this one (questionable and we will likely have more clarity after their morning shoot-around), but they will likely have Anthony Davis and the rest of the squad minus Danny Green.

The Lakers, as we know, are one of the deepest teams in the league and are playing great basketball right now. The Grizzlies, on the other hand, are really feeling the impact of having the hardest remaining schedule in the NBA as they have dropped 5 straight. This game is also their second game of a back to back and they will be without Jaren Jackson Jr. again as well as Brandon Clarke. With or without LeBron the Lakers should take care of business here. I expect this line to move significantly so I would take it up to 10 even if LeBron is out.
