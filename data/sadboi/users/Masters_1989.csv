I could see myself getting sad if I didn't get loved in a certain way; or if I was abused, but I don't see happiness as a necessity: I see it as a desire. However, I understand what you said about sleep (as with your other examples in your previous comment) because it is something that can physically damage someone - being tangible - which can lead to ruin without it. 

If someone hurts me emotionally, I may not like what is being done, but it may not lead me to ruin. Still, I DO wonder if I am making an error in judgement: if any form of damage means that someone is suffering from a ""need"" being hurt.

Again, I don't want to discount any of what you're saying: I just don't understand it. I have been in a lot of dark places, and I have been mostly treated as inconsequential by those around me a lot of the time, so it is difficult for me to judge whether emotional ""needs"" are real or not; and whether it is greedy, irrational thinking born out of an intense DESIRE to feel good."

I actually happen to be involved in Japanese culture to some extent, so I appreciate the word ""nakama"" beyond just the meaning of the word, itself. 

One of the reasons I have had so much trouble with friends is because I was shaping myself more to please them the more that trouble arose in our relationship together. I had been told that masks are part of life, so I got scared because it didn't feel right. Eventually, I ended a lot of my friendships by not responding to them because they hurt and scared me so much that they didn't feel like good friends (which I understand that they weren't). Instead, the idea of NOT having a mask sounds better, and now I do that with everyone when I can: only putting on a mask when I feel scared and don't know what to do. It has been better to let people know who I authentically am so I am not lying to them, and also so I can attract good people (hopefully).

A ""nakama"" sounds very good. To me, that sounds like a true friend. Other forms of ""friends"" sound moreso like acquaintances to me even more than before after what you said, so thank you. Unless I'm wrong, ""nakama's"" sound quite good, while acquaintances sound adequate for just workplaces and social gatherings. Trust is very important.

(I am quite shy and very vulnerable, so I didn't want to be too close to them to protect myself, and to not be ""needy"".)

I have spent a TON of energy in trying to help people in the past that I knew were good, but didn't have deep connections with. Those people DID forget me, or didn't care to stay connected. I think the idea of not putting effort into helping someone else is a very good idea because my level of empathy has lead me to a lot of pain over the ideas of being altruistic and ""good"" in helping others. I usually end up feeling sacrificed for others, rather than feeling like I have done well as a friend.

I'm scared, and curious, though, from the notions you gave. If you shouldn't help other people in those ways, then how can you be deep friends aside from having common interests and feelings of compassion? Whom should you bother to help? Most of all, what is the point of a friend if you aren't willing to help them with certain things, or need help, yourself? If you need a support network, or could use one, why should friends count for anything if you shouldn't put anything upon them (I kept my problems to myself), and they shouldn't help you? I don't want to have friends that are just ""lip service"" or ""yes men"" or only hang around for common interests. If those made a person feel good, I feel like I would just be friends with anyone on the Internet that could be bonded with over something... unless that's okay. It makes me wonder what a friend is if I could just get enjoyment from strangers, or from treating friends as sources of joy for only myself, rather than something more. Again, unless that is how it should be."

I have a good sense of a lot of these things, and possibly more, but some things seep through my cracks of reasoning to the point that I don't know what to do, or I want to abandon an idea altogether. Your example regarding narcissism was very good because the only way to have a deep relationship is with a feeling of community between one another, yet a narcissist preys on such relationships. Because they can prey on it, it has made me not want to have those kinds of relationships, even though those are what I want, and because those are the best kinds for intimacy. There is a way to not allow a narcissist to take control, however, and to allow one to navigate such relationships freely, but I have had so much trouble that it has made me not want them - to my misfortune.

It would be SO nice to get that down, because I get so stressed with the ending to that game that I usually breathe a sigh of relief with sweaty palms each time I finish it. It is the most tense ending to a game I've played, although most of it comes down to how unfair it can feel as opposed to situational tension or difficulty (the latter of which would be much more acceptable - even welcome - to me).

Thinking about the difficulty makes me hope that Prime 4 (or whatever the game turns out to be) does not scale back the difficulty - instead, allowing for more options for difficulty for greater challenge and excitement of future playthroughs! I really don't want the difficulty pared back because of the backlash from this title: just fix the silly stuff and stick with the good!

Anyhow, sorry for getting off topic. Prime 2 is certainly my favourite, too, and I hope to see more games like it within the Metroid series in the future. :)"
CPTSD,fl7e04m,t1_fl6c58q,1584899796.0,"I have a similar feeling, at least. I get into something, and then I don't want to tell people because it feels too ""personal"" or - like you said - ""special"". I especially don't want to tell people because of how reductive people can be about it, such as: Zelda games having a ""formula"", and then me feeling like an idiot for playing a game that is formulaic instead of original when that is not always the case; or liking drawing and being told that I'm ""wasting time"" or being ""stuck in a fantasy world"" instead of living in the ""real world"", which is also not the case, as I just want to draw things I like.

Even now, I don't want to draw things even though I want to because I feel so terrorized by such bad things people could say that it makes me feel like such things are terrible, or a child's game, or stupid. Even with all of the artists out there that may do nice things and get lauded for it, I'm scared of having it talked about so casually that I feel like my work and dreams aren't worth anything; or that I have to feel scared of negative comments that could throw me off from even bothering to draw at all. I'm not just concerned about art, though - although it is one of the things I do that I'm scared of."

What do you eat instead? I'm curious in case I decide to try out a diet like that in case it could help."
Anxiety,fl67dlb,t3_fmqo6j,1584856948.0,"Not really, but I understand. I can have similar thoughts that work in the same way, but not for all things: only specific - albeit many - topics.

I'm sorry you feel the way you do."

Metroid,fkq8eiv,t3_fjxtln,1584434986.0,"I just did this a few days ago on the Gamecube, and it was great, too! Congratulations! (I had to face the Emperor Ing twice, rather than once, like you. ;D)

Also, nice percentage!"
Metroid,fkl391j,t1_fkkahgi,1584297531.0,"Fortunately, I was using the Gamecube. ;)

I tried that too, but didn't do it too much because I was scared of running out of time; doing the strafing strat instead.

I might try that again some time! That is cool how you found that out. Thanks again for your help. :)"
Metroid,fkjwqel,t1_fkfasfn,1584263206.0,"I tried it, and it didn't work too well. I still did it with a combination of the techniques though. I was wondering whether the phazon around me was disrupting me or not.

How did it work for you? Did you sometimes still get knocked out of a charge?"

Thanks for providing a source."

Metroid,fkflmz9,t1_fkfasfn,1584137153.0,"I've thought similarly, but I may have been to afraid to mess up and risk losing... which has happened anyway!

Thanks again. I sure hope the results are better. :)"
Hobbies,fkfl87i,t1_fkamqlm,1584136891.0,"Gotcha.

Well, we have some similarities, then, because I have depression, too - a very intense case.

Thanks for offering a strategy to me."
Hobbies,fkfkvd0,t1_fka20aj,1584136659.0,Not a problem. Thanks for trying.
Metroid,fkfaj21,t1_fkepcba,1584130269.0,"Very interesting. I'll try that. I was afraid that I might get hit and lose the charge, so I'm not sure if I ever tried that.

Thanks. I can't wait to see how it goes."
Metroid,fkcurk7,t1_fka8r75,1584061617.0,"That's what feels like what is going on; like they're going behind me or to the side of me - just like those damned phazon missiles. They're so curvy!

Thanks. I'll try what you said. It's what I was doing, but perhaps not enough."
fitness30plus,fkculwm,t1_fkcu6zb,1584061513.0,"Agreed. I'll see what I can do.

Thanks. :)"

Thanks for explaining your condition for me."
