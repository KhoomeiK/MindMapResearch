China_irl,fqnf68f,t1_fqndz0g,1589493756.0,是的，非常分裂。我觉得现在不只是豆瓣分裂，微博分裂，墙外中文社区分裂。现在的年轻一代都是趋向分裂的，我认识的现实中的人，网上的人，都越来越走向两个极端。
China_irl,fqncwnx,t3_gjrwj3,1589492624.0,"early 20s，完全没有接受过系统的性教育，也没有小册子。相关知识来源于初中时看小说和自己下电影看，小学时身边的男同学就看黄色网站和里番了。性教育的缺席、对涉及性的话题的缄默和回避以及审查的疯狂阉割，结果就是造成变态的压抑。性在很多人的意识上还停留在见不得人的阶段，自然而然就变得猥琐了。我们需要系统的性教育和分级制度。

国内网站上随便看看就知道，几乎任何东西都会被发散成色情的，看个游戏流程，甚至随便看个做菜视频。现在已经很少看b站了，弹幕和评论随处可见和话题毫不相关的意淫，看了觉得无聊又恶心。

再观察一下国内大多数父母老师对青少年谈恋爱的态度。早恋，我觉得这个词语本身就是打压的语气，负面的词汇，大大减少了双向沟通的可能。不关注心理和生理发展，心理上打压，生理上嘲笑，学习比什么都重要。高中时有同学在楼道的门后接吻，被老师抓到后被双双劝退了，这太可笑了。还见过都上大学了父母还不允许恋爱的（btw为什么成年人恋爱要征得父母同意，这又是另一说了）。大多数中国家庭里没有任何情感教育，比如如何处理爱慕、被拒绝，如何尊重。情感教育和性教育密不可分。反正都是负分。

关于目前年轻人的性观念，op可以看看豆瓣上的帖子，数量众多，是个不错的窗口。"

BPD,fk9f590,t3_fh7d60,1583974823.0,"Yes yes and yes. I feel it too. I used to think other people just cannot be able to love as deep and as much as I do. I was born to love. And sometimes can’t help but look down on people who can’t. That’s the reason why I was so sad after diagnosis, the thing I hang onto and be proud of turns out to be the symptoms. My so called love is categorized as fear of abandonment. How is loving so much a illness？

What if the love we thought is just something else, crave for validation, excitement etc? I still don’t know yet. When people don’t give me as much the love I hoped for return, I get really frustrated and hurt them, and that’s not okay. Might be something to do with egosyntonic in people who suffer from personality disorder？https://youtu.be/-yrcphZj2n8"

Mine is a LDR, so I sometimes wonder if we have spent more time together maybe this feeling would occur much earlier. Also during each intimacy I caught myself dissociating. I’m trying what you said, giving it more time and hoping it will go away. 

I used to believe love will fix everything, I still hope I do. Like love is the ultimate cure. I was so terrified to find out that it is not. There’s absolutely nothing can’t be done to reduce the emptiness. I really don’t know how to describe that calm despair, but I think you’ll get it. Sending you a huge hug. I’m also exhausted, it’s okay."
