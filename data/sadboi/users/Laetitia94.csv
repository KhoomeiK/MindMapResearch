But still the total deaths in the whole in my country werent higher the last weeks then the year before. How is that possble if we would have a pandemic now. In Great Britean the total death numbers per week arent higher either compared to last years. 
People throught Euope mentioned on youtube and aocial media there local hospitals dont seem to be much busier. No ambulances no busy ER no helicopters even if they were set in place for the pandemic. 
I really start to believe this pandemic was created by false information and media hype.
Last not least the German scientist, the head of the Robert Koch institute said the statistjc are manipulated by counting everybody that tested postively for Covid 19 even if they died from their pre exting conditions. Also in my country they started adding deaths in nursing homes even if they didnt test for corona at all. There are many ways to influence the statistics. 
Tge best ways if ro see if this years weekly death rates are tht much higher then the years before

 I am not expecting you to believe or agree about this and for me there are still many questions but i am not simply going to follow the official narritive."

dating,fmf17mc,t1_fmez4sd,1586017878.0,The article just repeats what the WHO says about the PCR tests. So that info is not made up. And yes it is very sensitive because it will also test positive with certain other virusses.
dating,fmdvlq2,t1_fmdn733,1585979396.0,You havent still explained why it is bullahit thar a test cant specifically test for covid19 when the WHo clearly admits rhis. You can look it up.

Italy had 7.1 millions of flue cases from october until march. 271 peoole died on a extreme days. You didnt really here about tbat anymore and suddenly it became corona with those numbers."

Theg built emergency houses and rooms for Intensive Care patients in empty buildings in case it was needed but until now are not necessary yet. The problems that might rise with overloaded IC's was because the governement made cut backs in the medical care and halved the amounts of Intensive Care beds the laat few years.
In 2018 there was a big flue epimedic and 11.000 people died in a few months. The lack of IC department beds were a big problem and the government did 0.about  it.
More people on youtube said there local hospital, at least their ER was not so buisy as they would have expectesn"

TwoXChromosomes,fmdejax,t1_fmddkr8,1585965824.0,"Well like i explained it isnt necessarily. You can test all the peope that have the worst case of the flue and amonia and other bad illnesses especially old people or people with other conditions and get them tested positively. There are a lot of peopel dying any way every day. The numbers sound huge but not when you look at it in proportion .

The banks are going to profit from this recession from huge influx of money fron central banks ehich is going to safe their asses for the problems they already had  multinationals wont suffer from this crisis only the middle and small businesses  world leaders will look like a saint.

TwoXChromosomes,fmdbyhg,t1_fmda701,1585964042.0,"Places like Italy had a lot of older people in towns and villages. It actually is the 2nd country with most elderly people. The large numbers of deaths dont seem to be more then a high flue season and general death rates comoared  with 2018 and 2019 are about the same for the lasts weeks, nothing extra ordinary. Furthermore 99.2% of Italies tests were elderly people with a lot of preexisting conditions. This could be that this coronavirus if it wss really there was more or less the last drop for a person to die which makes it not more dangerous than a heavy flue..
I dont know everything abo ut Italy since i live in the The Netherlands but there are a lot of ways to influence statisics. Like here they added people that died in nursing homes that werent comfired as covid19 patients but to be in the sure side they added them tit the list.
Tha same happened with the contaminations. A friend of mine has a grandmother in a nursing home. They thought she might have corona and were going to test it. Next moment the local news brought out this story that the corona virus broke out in this nursing home while his grandmother had tested negatively in the end.
And like i showed you in the article. With PCR test a lot of peoole are going to test postive for Corona because most people cary the virus particles anyway in their body no matter if they bacame ill with it or not. In other words you could die of a car accident and have carry some corona virus particles with you and still technically be listed as a corona victim even if you died from it. Not saying that happens but technically it couldm
I am not saying ir doenst exist but we dont know if it the virus is really here. All there are are false tests.
Btw the fact that the tests are not reliable is also said on the prescriptions the WHO gave themselves with the tests 
And why a pandemic. For political and economic reasons? Like the EU was falling apart and European leaders were have major issues, not anymore now, They are rhe heroes and the banks already had big problems behjnd the scenes. Creating a recession like this makes it easy for al the bank to get free money from the big european banks that is tax money from the people.
In america it might be used to bring trump down and the rest of the world judt follows what the US and EU are doing and what the WHO are saying."

PCR TESTs that are currently done in hostipals cant distinguish covid19 virus from other Corona virusses that we have had in the last decades so in most caees people do have particles of some or other corona virus in their body even if its just a little bit, even if it is one of the older less harmfull Coronavirusses. A PCR TEST wont see the difference and is going test postiive anyway, even if you just have some kind of coronavirus and even if it is just a little bit. It even will test.positive if it was in fact another virus that caused you the health issues like fever or amonia. 
The real tests where virus particles would be virally isolated that are reliable take much longer and costs 20.000 dollar.
So yes this pandemic is not a real pandemic but created by panic by the media and afraid politicians or for alterial motives."
