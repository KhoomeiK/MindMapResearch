quittingkratom,exd2oyv,t3_cs6ckk,1566165727.0,"Like the others said you’ll still have to detox once off the subs but a quick taper with subs does help and also you get all those other kratom alkaloids out of your system for a week before you have to deal with the opiate detox so it helps. I did the same thing but instead of suboxone, I did a two week taper with Vicodin. It actually worked fairly well. Still felt like shit during and after the taper but it was very managble compared to my other CT’s. Good luck and keep us posted on your progress."
quittingkratom,exd1ty4,t3_cs4w8v,1566165123.0,"With the story you’ve shared, I’d probably go the subs route. Find a sub doctor and ask to do a very slow taper (preferably no longer than two months though). But you have to do a slow taper, because of your reaction to kratom, suboxone detox would definitely be too much for you. I would get to as low as .125mg or even .062. You would have to research how to do that. Whether a water taper or cutting the strips very small (like 32 pieces). But I talked about this in another post. You must educate yourself about suboxone and be firm with the doctor prescribing it. Most of the sub doctors want you on it as long as they can. Some even make you pay cash for appointment even though your insurance would pay for both the script and appointment. They want your money. It’s a shitty market unfortunately, and because they took an extra class to become a certified suboxone prescriber that does not mean they know enough. They usually take that class to make more money, not really help. I’m generalizing but I have been to 6 sub doctors (they either moved or died etc), only one cared but even so was uneducated.

Anyways if you do all your research and take it slow, it can be rather painless. You’d only dose once a day so you get out of the habit of redosing and it’s easier to taper than kratom. There’s no jail out of free card. You have to understand that there will always be discomfort but this is probably one of the most painless ways. But this can turn into a catastrophe if you do not do the taper correct. You’ll end up with a even tougher addiction. There’s a reason most people on this sub don’t recommend suboxone.

This is just my input. Please understand I know your pain and hopelessness. I hear you. I now have a gabapentin dependence (not addiction because I don’t even get anything from this stupid drug!) that I got from rehab a year ago. It’s one of the worst drugs I’ve ever had the displeasure of detox from and I’ve done them all. (Heroin, benzos, Methadone, etc. When will I learn?) Let me know if you have any questions. I’ve had a combined experience of 5 years on subs, so I know some stuff.

(Side note: you will get PAWS anyway you cut it. Whether it’s a kratom taper, sub taper, ct, etc that is an unfortunate certainty however it shouldn’t last too long as you’ve only done kratom and nothing else for only 18 months)

You story really resonated with me. I’m sorry my friend. I might get downvoted for my input but I can hear the anguish and defeat in your tone that I see the other commenters might not have grasped."

quittingkratom,ex8d7vz,t3_cqw6xd,1566071874.0,"Treatment centers are very beneficial, I never regretted my time there. The people you meet at a facility is so unique and usually very uplifting. The social aspect is what always kept me there. There’s all the classes that are helpful and the therapy. They also will usually give you comfort meds. I think that’s the route you should go.

If you decide on the sub doctor route, understand that most are snake oil salesmen and your paying for their retirement. Most (at least in my area) don’t listen or really care. They want you on subs forever because that’s more money. Be strong if they do not listen, then get the script and do a taper on your own. Like the above poster said, you’ll want to start on no more than 4mg. I would start with 2mg and add an additional 2mg if your still in pain a half an hr later. Make no mistake the first one to two days you are on it you might be able to get a little high. Do not chase it as it goes away instantly and won’t come back. This drug is not meant for a high and has a ceiling effect. Taper down 2mgs the next day all the way down to .25. You’ll have to use a razor blade as our shitty system doesn’t sell the small milladoses like other countries. I wonder why. It’s because they want you on it forever. Let this scare you. Get off of it by 10 days I’d say. The sooner the better. Good luck."
quittingkratom,ex8auaf,t1_ex749ki,1566071035.0,"I think your projecting a bit.

1. He said he’s only been addicted to kratom so he wouldn’t know if it’s easier than heroin and Oxys. His pain scale is a lot less than ours. This is not something to gloat about.

2. Who says you must suffer a withdrawal completely? “What must come up must come down” There are studies that have shown that withdrawals can cause PTSD. I know a few of mine have. Comfort meds have their place. This dude is at 50gs a day. With my own calculations of my own experience and thats about 100-120mg day Vicodin habit. Sounds pretty shitty to me.

And 3. Treatment centers don’t put people on subs the entire time you’re there. It’s usually 4 to 7 days but it’s a soft taper to comfort the blow.  Some centers don’t even use subs. Now if he goes to a sub doctor that’s different however if he’s educated and does a quick taper, it can be painless as well.

How about we educate and not dismiss?"

I’m going to recommend getting a therapist and being completely honest with them. It is so important and so helpful. It’s makes it so you feel like you have a team against this addiction. This forum is helpful as well but nothing beats a therapist. And if your up for it NA meetings as well. But if I had to choose between the two, I would recommend a good therapist most.

ChoosingBeggars,evyblbu,t1_evxyylu,1564928429.0,"I kind of had something similar. I was driving thru a fast food and a man asked if I had any cash to spare. I said all I have is card but that I could get him something from the fast food. He thanked me and said yes, whatever’s the cheapest. I said nah just let me know what you want, it doesn’t matter. He was so grateful. Never seen someone eat so quick.

Another recent experience was I was driving home late from work one night and saw a homeless woman making her “bed”. I pulled over and asked if she was hungry. She was like “god yes!”. All I had was wedding cake from an event but she was so excited for it. I gave her a couple bucks too.

Never stop being kind. There are always bad apples in every bunch but kindness can reverberate into something amazing."
WagWalker,evyaeko,t3_clsucu,1564927502.0,"Tipping is so strange in my area. I walked a husky the other day, it’s was an ASAP was and no one in my area was taking it. The owners weren’t home and it was late, and even though I was going home, I took it because I felt bad for the dog. It was an hr walk and we walked almost three miles. I got a $2 tip.

Then I have a recurring walk for once a day, every day. The owner tips me $4 every single walk.

You just never know.

But my biggest tip for $10"

It doesn’t matter if your under your dads insurance. However I do agree that when your ready, you should tell them."

nevertellmetheodds,evrzjp3,t1_evqpeze,1564723798.0,"I had the same thing. My bird flew away two years ago in the beginning of July. I was so scared for him with the fireworks of July forth and the absolute heat of southern ca. 

Spent countless hours searching, put up posters, checked the local shelters and facebooks pages over and over. I put his cage out with parakeet sounds on, day and night. I was utterly heartbroken. This little guy is my fucking life.

About a week later when I lost all hope, I got a call from a man saying he found my bird. I literally cried tears of joy. It was unreal the relief you feel. The gratitude. My heart was whole again.

Turns out that my little buddie, after only maybe two or three hrs of flying, found out he couldn’t do the whole bird thing. He landed on a guys shoulder and the guy took him home. Apparently my bird picked a good guy, because this guy had another parakeet land on his shoulder just a month before. He bought a cage for it and had been taking care of them both.

I hope he found the owner for the other bird."

And I did often let myself because at the time I was living at home with no job. Honestly the only thing that helped was time. Your body will hopefully repair itself. It probably has to do with hormones but nothing that can be fixed or seen by doctors, your adrenals are probably shot. How long has it been it’s worst? And how old are you?"
