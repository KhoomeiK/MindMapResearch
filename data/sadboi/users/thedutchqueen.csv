i’m not sure if it’s just simply because they finally got around to it or if it was in response to my emails i’d been sending.

let me know if you need the email address i used i reached out to them about 5 times and finally got a call back! got an email also confirming i’ll be receiving 5 weeks of back pay in 2 business days. no word about the $600 bonus checks yet but i’m expecting those too!!!!!"

look up anxious/avoidant attachment styles and learn how people with these types of contrasting attachment styles tend to gravitate together.

it really sucks. i just want a hug and comfort, and he just wants to leave the house for hours. it makes me sick with anxiety. i don’t know how to fix this.

the man goes and buys some nuts, a fruit cup, and a couple other things thoughtfully looking at prices. He only ended up spending $7. I got cash back from the cashier and gave him another $10. The look of absolute relief on his face that he didn't have to go hungry that night humbled me."
