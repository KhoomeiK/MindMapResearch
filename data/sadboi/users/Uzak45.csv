movies,fqtq05s,t3_gi0kzc,1589643842.0,"What growth? His transition from using slurs to using slurs? Or how he only decides to be a mentor for Thao, in which he just spouts overly masculine bullshit? Write about a character that actually has a good thematic message. Walt was racist towards the end and now amount of getting shot up by a gang can change his backwards thinking"
movies,fqtpnp2,t3_g12mq6,1589643645.0,"For a movie that appears to come off as bridging race gaps and a changing of heart, it does the exact opposite. 

1. The whole time, Clint Eastwood continually uses racially slurs against the Hmong people even with his dying breath. 
2. This films idea of ""being a man"" is performing house matinence and getting a construction job at the age of 14.
Not to mention the horrific barber shop scene. 
3. Thank God Clint Eastwood was there to save the helpless Asians otherwise who else would he shout racial slurs and point guns at? If they wanted to make a good movie about breaking your own stereotypes they should have ended with Thao saving Clint's character in some fashion and Clint would STOPPED being racist."
HistoryMemes,fphalrr,t1_fph9a4b,1588617876.0,"This is where it gets tricky as there's no metric to tell what percent of the army were buying into the Nazi propaganda and which ones were ""doing their duty"". On the whole, it's best not to generalize a group of anyone. They are saying that it's a myth that the Wehrmacht didn't commit any warcrimes and was merely a pawn of Hitler's reign."
HistoryMemes,fpha7na,t1_fph7lbb,1588617680.0,"Neither. They're saying that the ""clean Wehrmacht"" myth orginiated during the period after the war where soldiers took up roles in policy and history, and as such perpetuated to themselves and others that they weren't Nazis, because they were in the ""German"" Army. This gave rise to the idea that the Nazi's seized control over Germany when in reality it was created and fostered by the German people of the 30's and 40's. Of course it isn't as cut and dry as, all the Germans of the 40's are Nazi's. But it would be wrong to assume that all of the citizens were brainwashed and didn't have any ability to prevent it from happening."
