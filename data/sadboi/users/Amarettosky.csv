I havenâ€™t ever thought of that being something that would hold a man back but I think in this day and age being open is a good thing. I also donâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessarily a bad thing. Share the same enthusiasm for panties I like.. like cheekies for example! ðŸ˜Ž"
CasualConversation,fq0bz93,t3_gg2gx7,1589029841.0,"Iâ€™m a manager at a privately owned grocery store.. we have been requiring all who enter as of April 27th, to wear masks. Mind you, all of us that work here have been wearing masks since mid March. Yesterday we had one man who raised hell saying this is America when we told him he needed to wear a mask to enter... while offering him a free mask.

So instead of taking the mask, he gives us the finger and says he wonâ€™t be back.

Good riddance."
