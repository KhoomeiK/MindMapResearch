It looks like you guys asked her in a very palatable way, but maybe back off as soon as you see any signs of discomfort. Her feeling insulted by this is...petty. She should grow up. It would have been a missed opportunity had you not have at least asked.

Sides:
- steamed vegetables with butter
- salad
- potatoes 
- rice
- pickled beats/carrots/literally anything
- fried cabbage with garlic

Main:
- any seasoned protein

Anytime I make spaghetti, lasagna, or anything more involved you can forget about the sides because I just don’t have the time/energy. 

Canned pea soup or canned soup in general makes for a great soup base - just add sautéed [whatever is in your fridge] and you’re set. 

Frozen perogies are your friend. Fry them with some onions and top it with sour cream.
