paralegal,fq3ubsd,t3_gg8w67,1589070368.0,"I could go on forever since I was a director of a Paralegal Program at one time (In California). I really tried to get the academic leadership to get on board with an ABA approval  but ultimately the decision was that the college already had a strict regional accrediting body (WASC)  so they didn’t see the value.  

I can see from an employers perspective it’s a way to weed out programs that are fly by night two week programs.  The state of CA has a few variations in the definition and require a certain amount of academic credits. Furthermore, the ABA has difficult standards for most schools to meet for example no online classes and a complete law library on site. (Not sure if this is still the case). 

The ABA doesn’t accredit they  “approve” paralegal programs and it is worth noting that only about 20 percent of all programs in the county are ABA approved.

I attended a non ABA program at a University back in the 80s when it was all just getting started. The profession is still unlicensed and unregulated to this day and I think it always will be because lawyers want the flexibility to hire whomever they want.  I’m not saying an ABA approval isn’t valuable  just that it’s not seen as necessary in the Academic world where schools have regional accreditation. And It’s expensive.

The ABA isn’t something lawyers are required to belong to either. They have to be members of their State Bar for licensing. 

But it’s exhausting explaining all of this.  It’s Easier to just go to the ABA one if you can. It’s never been a barrier to employment for me because a bachelor’s degree seems to help."

Your situation rings familiar. I made over $100K in Silicon Valley and it was a depressing, dead end absolute bore. (Sadly you can barely live on that in San Francisco). Furthermore I felt siloed, marginalized and ignored when I expressed any desire to move up or get more challenging work. Yes the money is good but at what price?  The high salary becomes a trap because where else can you get paid so well? Yes, nobody wants to feel like a flunkie all the time. I planned an escape route for a few years, moved away and started my own business as an Independent Paralegal. 

It still isn’t perfect but at least I do what I want. You could consider working for a company like Thomson Reuters. They provide Software as a Service to law firms and corporations and they hire people with paralegal (legal assistant) backgrounds all over the country as trainers.  project managers, tech support and salespeople. Think of the daily products you use in IP,  docketing software, DocuSign, Clio, Adobe etc. they all hire for product support. 

I was also an Instructor for awhile and became a Program Director at a community college for a Paralegal Program. But that’s another story. 

Legal support feels like a dying field is because it’s been around forever. We have operating courthouses in California that are over 150 years old. A lot of things haven’t changed and won’t as long as our Constitution is in place.  But at the same time there are innovators so maybe branch out.  These companies appreciate employees who want to be challenged. 

Good luck!"

Unemployed,flmj2h0,t1_fljc6e5,1585285128.0," Hopefully I linked the EDD appeal form correctly.  Fill it in and mail it they are required to respond. If they deny it you can request a hearing. It’s very informal just you and a federal judge. The EDD appears by phone from Sacramento. 

[EDD Appeal form](https://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de1000m.pdf) 


This all may change however with the new stimulus I believe the federal govt will provide money for the EDD to disburse. Let’s hope so. It happened in the 2008 recession. Once you ran out of state benefits the fed govt supplemented them in full automatically for up to 2 years. 


Below is the language I used for my appeal. The EDD lawyer agreed with my argument. If the standard base isn't sufficient they can use the alternate base period of the year before the standard. base. The EDD won't go out of their way to do this. It's easier for them to just deny deny. Most people don't appeal. You have to remind them of their policy. 


”I am appealing this decision in which I was denied benefits due to not having sufficient funds during the base period.  Pursuant  to EDD policy ”There are two types of base periods that may be used to establish a UI claim; the Standard Base Period and the Alternate Base Period. The Standard Base Period is the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the beginning date of the claim. Beginning with claims filed effective April 1, 2012, and after, if an individual does not have sufficient wages in the Standard Base Period to establish a claim, the individual may be able to monetarily qualify for a claim using the Alternate Base Period, which is the four most recently completed calendar quarters prior to the beginning date of the claim.”
