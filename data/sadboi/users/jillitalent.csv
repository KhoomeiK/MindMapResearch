Anxiety,f2dsb13,t1_f2dr9sr,1570163174.0,"I haven't tried the warm bath or shower. I get too fearful? (Not sure if that's the right word) to move... so I try to control my feelings before I even leave where I am even if it is my room.

Also, I didn't think about calling a pharmacy... I just looked up near by pharmacies and they are all closed :(

Maybe I'll try that.. some kind of game to help calm the mind until I can deal. It does seem like it turns into an obsession and I obsess over the feelings and then can't control it.."
Anxiety,f2ds2d3,t1_f2dravs,1570162932.0,"Yes, it is. That's a great way to describe it because moving my hands to type has made my hands ""calm down""... but the other extremities still feel it but not as bad.

And definitely just the symptoms. I definitely didn't like waking up and feeling like I didn't know what time or day it was or where I was... I guess I started to panic that I was losing my mind or my memory... I mean, I definitely don't like being sick right now. A family member I live with is going through chemo, so I worry of getting them sick and them hospitalized even though I'm wearing a mask and gloves and making sure to Clorox anything I touch with my bare hands that they may... so maybe that is attributing to it since I feel like I'm getting worse rather than better sickness wise..."
Anxiety,ewlaf1o,t3_cohwjf,1565513924.0,"Happening at this moment... had slept a bit earlier, but awoken by a nightmare and then my mind kept spiraling no how much I said it was just a dream... had been having a decent 2 weeks too... guess we sometimes take a step or 2 back :/"
Anxiety,evlvzsl,t3_ck6xbl,1564599953.0,Awesome job! I started to stop that and caffeinated sodas recently! Hope I get the same success and thait continues for you!
Anxiety,ev8q5sx,t1_ev8pxti,1564287556.0,"Got it. Been trying to get a hold of them, but I guess since after hours at the moment it's a bit difficult. I probably sound stupid, but I was/am worried it was like an OD symptom since it never been this strong before

Thank you for your reply."
