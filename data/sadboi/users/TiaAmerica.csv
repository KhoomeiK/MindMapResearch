Something that, after being abused by your classmates, family and friends and being called a weirdo for too long, is something that you wish for. Believe that nothing will never affect you anymore  provides a feeling of freedom and rest, and on the same way, they believe that being sociopath will also bring bravery, you'll finally face them and make them pay for all the pain, and that for them is cool.
