I experienced one patient last year, she was just sitting in a chair with head tilted to side, drooling, wailing loudly all day long and on top of that, she couldn't sleep properly. What a terrible life, just a human body with completely deteriorated person inside. It took us almost 2 months to find a combination of meds, that allowed her to sleep and be more peaceful during the day, she even communicated a little bit when she was leaving our ward."

AskPsychiatry,fni7obk,t3_g1lgxi,1586975372.0,"Working in inpatient setting I've seen several things over the past few weeks. Many patients with psychotic disorders have now delusions related to coronavirus (common example - they fear they infected entire town, country or even world with coronavirus). I've experienced suicidal attempts with triggers related to the pandemic (cancellation of their plans, work and financial problems, impact of quarantine on relationships). Older patients (especially with dementia) are suffering from restrictive quarantine measures in retirement homes and their mental health worsens with loneliness and lack of visits from family. Anxiety disorders are now even more rare in our ward, because even before coronavirus they weren't so common at inpatient. We have less patients with personality disorders. 

I anticipate deterioration of mental health of general population even of individuals that were ""healthy"" up until now. As for healthcare workers there is more stress than there usually is and it will certainly takes its toll on our health. I also suffer from depression and anxiety and my anxiety was through the roof when the situation began to worsen, now I experience something closer to emotional blunting and just get on with my day and work and try no to affect my patients with it."

I have one suggestion, that I give patients when they have hard time communicating what is bothering them - try to write down your thoughts and you can read them to your doc or let the doc read them and discuss with you.

AskPsychiatry,fnhzo63,t1_fnezeqx,1586971516.0,"It's hard to tell which medication is ""the best"", since everyone is different and reacts to meds differently. 

The medication you take at the moment is not sufficient for your anxiety, so I'd personally supplement it with other meds - antidepressants with anxiolytic effect. I see you had citalopram and I wonder why not escitalopram, since it's better for anxiety. I also see you used pristiq (desvenlafaxine), but not effexor (venlafaxine) - which is definitely more effective. These are just some examples I can think of right now.

There are still other options, please discuss them with your doc, tell them you're not feeling ok. Sometimes it takes a lot of time to finally get the right meds, so please be patient and don't give up. Good luck."

Learn chords with various voicing - this is super important, because it can have dramatic effect on how your music sounds. Learn a tune you like. Also ear training is your best friend, not only will it give you better understanding of music, it will help you to intuitively compose your own tunes. For producing you don't need to be a piano magician, but it surely helps. Good luck."

My process is different, because I usually hear something in my head and then I try to play it on the piano and then experiment and expand on the ideas. It's very spontaneous, but then again, I don't write music for film and don't need to go for specific mood or setting."
