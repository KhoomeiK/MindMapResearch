grunge,ezxtgqj,t3_d2ux4p,1568249237.0,"Grunge was just the term that described the underground music scene in Seattle. Before the term 'grunge', I believe they called it the 'Seattle sound'. I don't think of grunge as a music genre, it is a very loose term and most 'grunge' bands identified with more established genres (like punk, in Nirvana's case). Grunge was more of a movement, IMO.

I don't think there is a definitive grunge band, but I do think that Nirvana was the 'face' of the grunge era."
AskReddit,ezbmsvz,t1_ezbgu4a,1567822585.0,"Take it how you like it.

That being said, yes, sometimes depressed people use their own illness as an excuse, however, it doesn't mean they aren't sick. Sometimes its done intetionally, sometimes it isn't. It doesn't mean it is okay to do it, it is shitty, but at the end we are talking about someone that has an illness and is in need of psychological help."
