For those who have no problem, that's great! Enjoy your new flair in-game. But for those who do, why on earth would you still not give an option to disable them for the enemy team? You can't hear their voice lines. You can still see your teammates model.

However, he's done some good things, or good things on behalf of others. He's not the devil incarnate. More than likely the GOP's political pawn. 

Unfortunately, the Dems have no clear leader, and because of this Trump will most likely win next year. This will undoubtedly make voter apathy surge. I'm pretty much in this category. So many people vote down party lines, and refuse to have active discussions. If he wins again, it's only another 4 years, no biggie. I doubt he'd do anything too extreme. We're already the laughing stock of the world, and it's not like people are going to stop laughing anytime soon. US politics is a comedy gold mine."

I'm not kosher with several circumstances of abortion, but that's not for me to decide. My personal beliefs have no bearing on my stance that women should have complete control over their bodies. 

Conception isn't a miracle. We live in a time where we should embrace having the ability to decide when and where we bring new life into the world. Again, this isn't up to you, random internet stranger, this is up to the pregnant individual. 

And please don't gloss over the damage that an abortion can have on a woman. It's not easy, and it's not pleasant. I'm sure the majority don't want to get one, but they are. It's not up to anyone but them to justify why. They need to live with the consequences.

pics,fap190p,t1_fap0jub,1576277377.0,"I'm sure that happens more than you think. There are plenty of women that can't get one even if they wanted to due to the risk they'd put on their own bodies. It absolutely is a consequence of having sex. They deliver a baby they don't want, and who knows that can happen afterwards. 

However, contraceptives aren't fullproof. Accidents are a real and common thing. I don't think it's appropriate for a woman to be forced to carry out her pregnancy. I also don't think it's appropriate to cherry pick scenarios where it's suddenly okay for your morality to allow someone to get a abortion. I will always side with women who want control over their bodies."

If a woman chooses to get an abortion for whatever the reason, and she can do so without harm to herself. That is her decision. Not mine, not yours. Do you think they're happy and ecstatic to be getting one? I doubt it. Do you think that people are going to suddenly stop seeking abortions if it's smart for them? No. Do you want to go back to the dark times of coat hangers and women throwing themselves down the stairs? 

We should be providing education and birth control to these women.

You can judge those people all you want, but you or I  shouldn't be in control of what they can and cannot do. It's their decision."
