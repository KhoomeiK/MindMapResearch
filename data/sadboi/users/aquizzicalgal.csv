People that can help are mainly physicians and detox centres, but pharmacists can be part of your recovery team as well. Join an NA group as soon as you can - the only requirement to join is the desire to stop using. Sadly, you may have to cut contact from your parents for a while. They are not helping you - they are enabling you. It doesn’t mean that you can’t ever see them - however when things get bad, when the cravings are hitting hard and the urge gets to you, they won’t be there to support you if all they’d do is give you your drug. It will be painful, there will be days when it’s all fine and then all of a sudden it hits you bad. There will be bad days, but there will be more good clear days than if you were still using.

BPD,fqpj9k4,t3_gjwy7t,1589547730.0,"My mom caught me when I overdosed and I couldn’t move. I was awake and alert, but paralyzed. A failed attempt. But seeing my mom... she got angry. She was angry at me. Instead of calling 911 she cried and kept yelling at her paralyzed daughter, expecting me to reply. If you commit suicide, people will not react the way you’d think. They would actually resent you for taking your own life.

I came to the conclusion that the idea of suicide is of your own pain. Your life matters as much as YOU give it value. The pain they inflict on you could be unintentional - sometimes it’s of our own interpretation of their words/actions. At times it’s how we interpretate things that has us feeling negatively. To prove them wrong, I’ve decided to be the best person I can be. I don’t maintain a relationship with them.

Resentment is such a strong feeling that takes us down. It takes recognition that we’re just reliving the past while everyone else moves forward. People change, but resentment prevents us from changing and moving forward ourselves. It took me a few years to change these ideas. It can get better <3"

You do learn that the feeling, with sobriety time, will be less intense in general, but even recovering addicts have a bad day where they just really want to use. The question lies in how much you want to stop using. Congrats on finding a pattern. I would suggest litterature from Narcotics Anonymous, even just attending NA meeting for support can help. And the best advice I got was to only take it one day at a time. Maybe prepare yourself for when those few days pass and the urge comes back. Any video games, puzzles, readings or hobbies you can set up to fill your time? You might relapse and use, but don’t beat yourself up. Just aim to go a bit longer.

Right now, I’ve stopped using for four days. The past month-and-half have been a roller coaster, but this is actually my longest streak so far. If you need Detox, it’s not shameful, it’s self-care, and it depends on your use. We wish you the best."

Depending on their addiction, you may have to be careful regarding their response - they could become desperate and go on the streets. It’s very unfortunate, but even in recovery groups it is required that the patient takes their recovery into their own hands. Offer them options (the pharmacists here were using guides through CMHA), but don’t expect the patient to respond as well.

Resentment is a powerful emotion in itself. I’ve noticed that a lot of people with Borderline have heavy resentment they carry, which means we carry constant frustration and anger every day. We can’t help but wonder how things could’ve been different if we were given the fair chance we should’ve gotten. People around us don’t understand the helplessness we lived through, and so they expect us to just deal with our feelings by ourselves.

It does get better. The resentment may not go away, but it can be greatly reduced. I came to terms with my life by facts; my parents were not equipped to raise someone like us. It doesn’t stop the resentment, but I realize I put less energy into being angry at them. I put more energy into what I can do now to change myself for the better. Your mother is probably upset about what she did and upset she can’t change the past (doesn’t excuse her to put it on you). But while she loses her relationship with her daughter, you can learn from her mistakes and grow to be better. You are smart and resilient. You deserve happiness. Anger can be resolved. Time is a great healer for break-ups, not just because days pass, but because we have hindsight on what we should’ve/ shouldn’t have done.

If I was your mom, I would’ve listened. Told you that you’re not alone going through panic about work - a lot of people are lost, scared and confused about how they’ll pay next week’s groceries. I would’ve told you that your relationship was maybe not meant to be, but you can’t keep beating yourself up about it.

Another thing we worked on was keeping a healthy, consistent lifestyle, meaning I get enough sleep as often and regularly as I can, we eat healthily but treat ourselves at times, usually together.

I have learned as well that people can seem nurturing and compassionate through a small interaction, but behind closed doors you’d be surprised how people are different. I felt like I couldn’t complain about my upbringing because I was well-fed, had a roof and so much freedom. However I had no emotional support. It took me years to understand that blaming my parents for my upbringing made no difference but distance myself. The “what if’s” just keep feeding anxieties and regrets you can’t change.

Maybe ever refer to what you’d have to cut back in order to keep the dog. I personally would’ve asked your daughter to present some research on raising a pet - she would’ve gotten some info that she wouldn’t reject coming from you.

Now those are all things that could’ve been done before, but this is now. I would make a budget WITH YOUR WIFE so she can actually see how financially distressed you both are. Then decide on what you will have to compromise in order to keep the dog, whether it’s no more take-out, shopping or any other leisure expenses (if any). Since your daughter is home most of the time, I would make sure she is CONSISTENTLY taking care of the dog, be it feeding, walking, picking up poop, playing, etc. And your wife can support her, but shouldn’t expect you to pick up after. Bringing the dog back is a difficult, but reasonable decision. After showing her the family budget, I would have a long talk about trust and expectations towards each other."

I would hear from relief pharmacists that the pay hasn’t been as good especially if they are under a company, compared to an independant relief pharmacist or a pharmacy manager. It also depends on the work environment - bigger cities may have more than one pharmacist on duty, which can alleviate the workload. Rural cities/towns tend to be short staffed or overworked if there can be no relief. I would ask in your area if it’s what you’d expect for work (hours, shifts, breaks if any, what kind of patients you mostly see here).

I live in the east coast, and pharmacy work is largely impacted by the availability of pharmacists (somewhat short), since distance can be far between home and work."

If you don’t call it out, it will keep happening. I would tell her straight out that she brings up an ex too often.

That doesn’t mean you compromise. At this point you can reaffirm your expectations, and decide together either you move on forward or not. Don’t stop yourself from your dreams."

He wasn’t understanding enough of women’s bodies, had no compassion or concern but for himself because he couldn’t get some. It sounds like his reasonings after were defensive.

You had him when he acted childish, but then you did something that overshadowed his comments. Sorry but I wouldn’t blow my snot in a tissue to prove anyone I’m sick. I don’t think just blatantly showing bodily fluids, even on a pad, is appropriate.

I would write for hours, but through that time I would try to work out what I felt and what is going on. Reading back, some was coherent, some entries were fucked up. A journal is a way for someone to sort what comes in their mind and their heart. It’s like reading the worst parts of her brain that she is ashamed about and trying to make better.


However, I do understand you’re not ill-intended. Maybe look into having shared calming sessions (meditate five minutes together or something). Don’t give up on being resourceful, look for information about helping loved ones with anxiety and OCD. You’ve done so much already for her, I hope you can find a better place emotionally for the both of you."

Depending on how long you’ve been together, he may not fully realize the extent of your needs, but mostly the entend at which he can help you meet some of them. That may take him more time and experience.

I think you should sit down and talk more in details. It may be that he has to trust you being with a stranger living under the same roof away. It’s like a roommate, except his presence is important to your progress with work and life, and so he lives there as long as you do. Could your partner bare the idea of you traveling abroad living with others? If not, then it’s up to him if he can accept it. All you can decide is if you’re ok with how he handles it.

I hope everything goes well for you."

BorderlinePDisorder,fi07udr,t3_f5mt9d,1582029540.0,"I say these would be all traits of Borderline. One thing that differentiates with bipolar is how the mind changes. Usually, bipolar causes a shift in thought without rationale, while borderline pursue the thoughts that they are having. It can be hard to tell if the reaction or expression of emotion is radically opposite of the social context because the person alone can either explain or not the change of emotions. 

Between anti-social and borderline, it depends on consistency of behaviour. Usually anti-social behaviours are persistent and consistent with lack of empathy towards others. Borderline might just have you distant yourself radically, usually following a situation or event. Borderline is hard to identify thoroughly because the extreme behaviours are similar to any other extreme behaviours that are specific of another disorder. It doesn’t mean you’re a mess - it means you have the knowledge to change what you want for the better. The impulsivity is the most difficult trait I face, but I’ve learned it takes time and energy to go against the flow of what you’re physically feeling."
