And I don’t know if you can help the heating. But try that too or else get a cheap humidifier or even keep a bowl of water in your room. ( change it often so it doesn’t get gross) the best moisturiser I have found for skin is oiling my body after shower

Hot showers can make the problem worse so idk it could be that.

It’s good you are using conditioner, and you don’t wash overly often that’s also good. 
You also air dry, I mean, you are doing everything it seems just perfectly. Has your hair always had the same texture? It doesn’t look bad..

You might benefit from doing a clarifying wash with a clarifying shampoo and then follow up after your conditioner with a vinegar rinse. Both of those things will get rid of any build up on your hair, and potentially soften the hair. I notice a big difference I. Smoothness and softness just by usi vinegar rinse occasionally.

You can use the cheapest normal white vinegar and mix a little water in, it will smell but once hair is dry no more smell I promise. 

You hair looks nice, it doesn’t look bad to me but I hope that might help you feel better."
