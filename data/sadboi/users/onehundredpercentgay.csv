AskReddit,f3gmg27,t3_dgzyym,1570912924.0,"With my best friend when I was 11 or 12, we were staying in her 2nd home in the south of France as her family did every year, we got given our own little section of the house to ourselves. 2 bedrooms, one with 2 bunk beds and one with a double bed and a bathroom (this is relevant). We'd been there for a few days and had both slept on the top bunks of either bunk beds. We were both sat on the bottom bunk of one of the beds and she asked me if I'd had my first kiss yet, I said something like ""What do you mean H? You'd be the first person I'd tell if I did!"" And then I remember her saying ""I wonder if you're a good kisser.."" and kissing me she pulled away and said something like ""not bad""  and I was frozen - I'd never looked at girls in that way until she kissed me, it was like opening the Pandora's box of sexuality and the beginning of realising I was a lesbian. It's one of the most purest memories I have.That night when I went to get in bed she insisted we go sleep in the double bed next door ""because the air con is better in there"" we slept side by side for the first time and she inched herself closer and closer until she was holding me. Looking back on it, H never did turn the air con on that night.."
