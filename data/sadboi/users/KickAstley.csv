When that happens, their vet anxiety goes way down - they are too tired and worn to care. Besides, you can have the service done in your home.

My girl suffered from kidney failure. I laid down towels on tile when she was no longer strong enough to keep her feet under her on slick surfaces. I made concotions of soft food and high-calorie gel when she stopped eating. I bought fancy fountains when she was no longer interested in drinking. I learned how to give her fluids with an IV bag when we could not longer keep her hydrated through food and water alone. 

After a sleepless night just holding her when she could barely even move, I knew that the cruelty would be in continuing to let her suffer. I was with her every step of the way, just as we'd been together for so many years.
