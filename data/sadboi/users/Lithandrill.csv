What is low RPS a symptom of? 

(As for the experiments it's just a bunch of torque sensors throughout my powertrain and trying to see what, if anything, changes with different configurations of gears, engines and props.)"

But on the other hand there is something frantically exciting about it as well. We are not quite at the point yet where it is too late to change things and, while I believe the chance of something actually changing is very small, now is the time that we can still act. 

Read up on volunteering opportunities, not for some TrashTag photo bullshit but for progressive political candidates or organisations in your areas. Spread the word. Join rallies.

Yeah, the end of the world is upon us, and it's probably a race to see whether it's the impending water riots that kill me or I do it myself, but somewhere it's also a little bit exciting.

depression,f90jquu,t1_f8zamc4,1574973285.0,"It can fluctuate a lot based on both where you live/want to live, and how much comfort you are willing to sacrifice. 

Personally, while I love the idea of stepping out of the rat race, I would still like some comforts/modern conveniences. After all if I am going to be miserable and depressed in the middle of the woods I might as well not bother. 

I reckon that the bare minimum would be the following: 

A plot of land with enough area (and decent weather/soil) for farming, with reliable running water (i.e. doesnt dry up in summer) and some trees.
Some structure. Unless you have the skills, time and resources to build something yourself from scratch you would need at least a house or hut to exist. It can be simple and/or in disrepair (gives you something to do) but good enough to live in year round.

This alone would in my case set me back 50k at the very very very minimum. Keep in mind, no loans or mortgages since presumable we wouldn't have a stable income (if any). 

On top of that it will take a while to become completely self sufficient when it comes to food. I estimate at least a year until you can even begin to imagine a healthy, self sufficient diet year round based on just farming/preserving alone. Hunting and fishing sound romantic but would likely be sporadic at best, illegal at worst.  

Lets say 50 a week, roughly 2500 for a year. Lets double this for emergencies and to also include some things like toiletries and other household items. 

So, the bare minimum for living in a run down shack, without electricity and not starving would roughly be 55-60 000. 

Now lets add electricity. Costs here will vary on how many hours of sunlight you get, angle of the roof, etc. Roughly 5-10k for the solar panel and required installation with another 5-10k for a battery bank. 

Compost toilet will set you back anywhere from 2-8k. 

Tools, initial farming/preservation supplies, maybe a few chickens, some building supplies, etc. Another 5-10k. 

Long story short I would say that the bare minimum not to starve/freeze to death in your own filth would be at least 100k. Realistically if you want this to be sustainable for a 5-10 year period with yearly expenses such as a car, a phone plan, yearly maintenance, etc 200k is probably more realistic. 

I make an above average salary and if I tried really really hard it would take me 10 years to even get there...
I would love nothing more to get out of this hellish endless cycle of meaningless work, but I simply do not see a realistic way to do it that is not a kneejerk, self destructive reaction that would, ultimately, not improve my life in the slighest, just make it miserable in a different way.

And so here I am on the depression subreddit. :)"
