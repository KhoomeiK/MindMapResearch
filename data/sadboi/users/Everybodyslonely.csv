relationship_advice,fikjrka,t3_f88hoy,1582481664.0,"Something I actually have experience with! 

So my husband's family has similar habits (though maybe not quite as bad). I love them, they're wonderful people, but they're hoarders. His childhood home is disgusting, and they have way too many cats and one (1) litterbox that doesn't get changed nearly enough. The whole house is dirty, dusty, and reeks of cat urine. 

This was a huge issue for me, and is still a slight issue sometimes, but there are ways we've overcome it together.

1) He had to acknowledge that there was an issue. This wasn't easy for him, and it didn't happen right away. It's hard to admit that your parents have a problem, and he was ashamed of it.

2) We had to talk about it, and lay out clearly what our expectations were when we moved in together. This we probably could have done better, and we argued sometimes about cleaning at first, but with good, respectful communication, it's workable. I've made it very clear the expectation that I have for a clean house, and how it negatively affects me when that expectation is not met. He's made it clear his hangups and emotions around cleaning, and we're working through them, with me making an effort to be nicer about it. Now that's he's more used to it, it's been getting a lot better.

3) Boundaries. He knows that I will NEVER spend the night at his parents house, and if they suggest it, he shuts it down. I would suggest that you draw a hard line about staying at that beach house. Also we're on the same page about future kids being at that house, which is a hard no. 

4) Sometimes you do have to suck it up. We go to his family every other Christmas, and they do Christmas morning at his house, so for half a day every two years, I grit my teeth and bear it. I just accept that it's a part of marrying into this family, and it's a small sacrifice. 

I think if you're serious about this relationship, and he's willing to work with you, it's very doable! Try not to worry too much and pull the plug just yet, if you really want to keep the relationship."

I don't think it was a reflection of our relationship, it was entirely me being in a panic state (woo anxiety disorder!) and being uber paranoid. It was a weird one time thing, and it hasn't happened since. That, I could understand. Constant checking though... weird."

Edit: whoops sorry, that number is for Canada. In my state, the weekly unemployment pay ranges from $20 to $400. I make 2k a month, so my unemployment would be about 1k a month, but that's not enough to pay my bills. Also I would lose my health insurance."
relationship_advice,fi1iysy,t1_fi0nx88,1582058683.0,"My dad used to be incredibly sexist, and would say judgemental things about women, especially overweight women, out in public under his breath (or so he thought, wasn't great at whispering). I just stopped putting up with it, and I told him how sexist he was. I told him it was gross, and that I hated it. He argued with me of course, and we butted heads for a long time, but I didn't let him get away with that shit anymore. Eventually, he stopped. Later, he revealed to me that I actually opened his eyes, and he admitted that I was right all along. That he was just an old man stuck in his ways, but he could change. 

I don't know how your parents would react, but for sure nothing is going to happen if you do nothing."
