This is Dustin McKissen's statement:

""Due to some of my social media activity, it is time for our family to come forward with something that may soon become public news. To begin with, this is not a joke, a plea for attention, or, frankly, a plot for my next book. This is very much a real thing.

In 2006, during his meth addiction, my father, David McKissen (DOB 4/16/56) told Megan about a sister that was born before Cody and I. The search for that sister has been and on-and-off pursuit for the past thirteen years, ultimately leading to more dead ends and questions. 

This pursuit ultimately led to me to uncover an extensive amount of troubling information related to my father. It is a very long story, and not one appropriate for Facebook, but we have submitted a list of disappearances we suspect my father’s involvement in to federal authorities in Canada. We have also obtained tangible evidence linking my father to this list. 

A few days ago, we discovered a recording of a partial phone call made during the abduction of a young mother from the Edmonton area in 2010. That woman’s name was Amber Tuccaro. 

Her voice can be heard in the link in these comments.

Along with the voice of my father. 

My father has been staying on a rural ranch in the greater Edmonton area on and off since 2009. He is an American citizen, with no legal standing in Canada. Further, we suspect him for other disappearances in Arizona, Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho dating back to the 1970s. 

Me, Megan, Cody, Alisha, our children, and multiple family friends have all identified the voice as my father. It is particularly clear in the portion where he says “50th Street.” 
I am posting this for a reason. Too many family members to count have turned away from us, encouraging us not to air the family’s “dirty laundry.”

That makes me sick.

A dead young mother is no one’s idea of “dirty laundry.” Young men who look startingly like my son are not dirty laundry. Human beings are not bloody rags.

I post this because absent any support from our extended families, I have turned to the relatives of victims and amateur social media detectives to help catch this man, a man who I believe is a prolific killer targeting both genders over an extended period of time. 

(My father is bi-sexual, with a history of violent meth and other drug fueled relationships with both sexes.)

If you know any information about my father, whether you are a stranger, friend, or family member, please help. There are real lives at stake and real justice that needs to be served. 

I desperately, desperately wish I saw this sooner—but before I knew he was my father, a suspected serial killer, he was my dad. He was Grandpa Elfie. I couldn’t see beyond that, despite a mountain of shady behavior, and I will never not regret that—but at least the blinders did come off, and though this may not be the best time to say this, my family and I will have to own both our pride and our shame. 

I am proud of my brother and his wife Alisha as they supported us through this journey and darkness. I am proud of my children, who, despite the bleakness of this, have done everything they can to catch a killer they once called Grandpa. I am deeply proud of my wife, who has supported me every step of the way throughout this, including somehow managing to grow and strengthen our business. I am proud of myself. I stared into some of the bleakest, blackest darkness a human being can look at, set my own fear and trauma aside, and am working as hard as I can to put this man in the dark hole he belongs in.

More than anything, I am proud of the families and friends of victims who have welcomed me into their lives as we work to bring closure and justice, even though I am the son of the man that caused them so much pain. 

You have watched the shows and listened to the podcasts where social media is used to catch a killer. 

We have turned over a mountain of information to multiple law enforcement agencies, but we need your help. If you know anything, please contact me. 

And if you are one of our family members who decides to aid, abet, and inform my father after you read this?

Know that I will do everything I can to make sure you end up in the same dark hole.

And I keep my promises. 

Now, share this post. Help with the chase.

UPDATE: I have shared the voice recordings with Ms. Tucarro's brother, who confirms they sound alike."""
