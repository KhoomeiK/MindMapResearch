KindVoice,ewpt4p9,t3_cpiy24,1565648703.0,"I am sorry that you're going through this at such an early age already. No one can truly understand your pain, except you. I am 21 years old and my teenage years were a huge mess.

What helped me personally was doing something I am really good at. No matter how boring it is. For me it's sometimes work. Progress is something that is powerful enough to keep oneself moving. Its the only single tool that makes me want to keep going with life sometimes. The appreciation I get to hear from my clients after doing some good work makes life worth living.

Just yesterday I bought myself a Guitar. I've never been into it before but I wanted to try something new out. Have you tried drawing? I've heard trying new things make one feel better.

Also, volunteer. Even if its not much. Helping others is something that's always made me feel better during my worst of times. Sometimes I believe that there is no positive human life on earth worth being wasted. Because each one of it is capable of helping someone else.

And it's a fact that during most of the time when you help someone else, you will notice a shift in your mood.

So in case if you don't feel like doing anything, at all just start helping others. It would make life so much worth living. You'll realise how good it feels to help someone else. If you think you cant do much about helping either, at least write a post that can give others hope. Who knows, one post of yours can save someone's life, give someone hope.

I wish you a wonderful day and loads of blessings. Much love from a stranger <3"
