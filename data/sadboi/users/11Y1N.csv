Just a guess that he’s doing everything he can to keep you from really seeing it. Maybe try talking to him and explain that him not accepting help is more hurtful and worrisome than him being dependent on you in any way during a time that he needs support. If my guess is right, he will either tell you how he truly is feeling or accept more help. A lot of people struggle with asking or agreeing to help"

Sometimes it’s hard for me to tell with alcohol. I’ll do shit like buy a 6 pack on a Monday because I want it, and then not drink it until two saturdays later.
