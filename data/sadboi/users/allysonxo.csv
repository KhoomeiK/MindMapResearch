Endo,fozqpml,t3_gag64q,1588195204.0,Yes. I had Horrific pain that came out of nowhere and was severe for 2 days while in hospital. It Was manageable -but still very bothersome for the next few weeks while all of the blood in my abdomen absorbed. It’s pain unlike anything else. Very distinct.

curlyhair,fnf7fzb,t1_fnedig2,1586902800.0,"Oh yeah that is understandable. I’m not sure how much it costs to ship internationally, but I would hope it’s reasonable. For a long time; the product was not available in the US. Only the UK."
curlyhair,fnf7am6,t1_fnefz8i,1586902721.0,Ah okay. It does have silicones. I suppose I kind have my own GC method as I don’t follow it all to a T. In addition: Sulfate free shampoos don’t work so well on my hair. I’ve tried several. Which ones have you had good luck with? I’m always looking to try new wash products
curlyhair,fneda07,t1_fne73a4,1586887299.0,It’s my holy grail product. I’m so happy I found it. It gives me loads of definition without the crunch -it’s not too heavy; and it doesn’t take a lot of product unlike many others I have used. In the past I’ve used 3-4 stylers to achieve decent results. I love that all I need is one product these days. A little pricey but totally worth it if you’re looking to try something new and have fine hair. I’m not sure how it performs on coarser hair.
curlyhair,fne6okr,t1_fndz8nj,1586884009.0,Thank you! It’s come a long way

curlyhair,fne4psh,t1_fne4fkq,1586883018.0,I just spritz them with a bit of water from a water bottle and fluff with a pick. Sometimes I’ll apply a dime size amount of styling gel if it is needed

I don’t have any advice but I just want you to know you are not alone and that birth control has caused very similar effects on my body. I’ve tried them all.
