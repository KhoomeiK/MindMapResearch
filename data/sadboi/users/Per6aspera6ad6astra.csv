Currently learning Portuguese and ESL. 

I don't think I have any artistic talent or skill, I don't play any instrument, etc

I don't have a mathematical intelligence or ability

I would like to practice a sport, but I haven't had the opportunity yet to do so."

And it went OK, I actually thought I wasn't going to cry, but ended up crying at some point during our conversation. The service was provided by a public hospital in the area so we had about 45 min only before the other patient came in. Hopefully I will be having the next appointment by next month.

But overall it was OK. I realized some things still hurt and need to take care of that."

Well, I once had an uncomfortable situation but with another guy, the day after we had sex he wanted to hang out with me again and do it all over but of course I said no. Sex was super ackward and there was some biting and scratching I did not enjoy, he was violent for my taste. Besides that he was kind of rude to me. 

I will go out in a few weeks with a guy and I just wanted some input or advise since he's made clear several times he is not looking for anything romantic."
