depression,fqgidr5,t3_gisgvl,1589347068.0,But thanks for reaching out to me
depression,fqgibvz,t1_fqgi04l,1589347027.0,The pain has become unbearable. It's constant. Can't take it anymore. I just want oblivion.
depression,fq76xtm,t3_gh8q47,1589142575.0,"Same here. I seem to always have to apologize for not getting better. I started self-isolating because I'm sick and tired of having to face all the disappointment and blame. Oh, and the magical remedies, like I haven't thought of going outside for a walk etc etc."
depression,flztj8c,t1_flztfnv,1585633114.0,Have any in mind right now?
depression,flzsnp4,t3_fs6yf8,1585632339.0,"Hope u feel a bit better now that you let it out.... I recommend you read some quotes from Cioran. Helps on the daily. Maybe just two or three.

I stopped actively thinking about killing myself when I found his writings. To him, the first aberration is having been born at all. Then it's jus a matter of dealing with it until you die as naturally as you were born. Plus, he dark-humour funny."
depression,flzs4vn,t3_fs6zid,1585631883.0,"Always found a part of me that I couldn't find nowhere else in sci-fi films. Gattaca, for instance. So kinda feel you."
depression,flzqpr1,t1_fl6cu0o,1585630684.0,Still there??? Please answer!
depression,flzptip,t1_flzpi1e,1585629948.0,"Also.... Have you thought about how ""beauty"" is a rigid social construct and maybe he's smart enough to have liberated himself of that and *actually* enjoys laying eyes upon you????"
depression,flz54fv,t1_flyfzux,1585615722.0,Congrats! I am bi too and - apart from the bigots- it is awesome!
depression,flyferp,t3_fryqfu,1585601140.0,You're not alone. *You* are okay. It's the World that's crazy and absurd. Especially right now. People who cope well with all this are the ones that have a problem (or rather *are* the problem). Hang in there. We are many out here trying to to make it to tomorrow. Stay one of ours please. Hug.
depression,fl5rh8o,t3_fmbsdc,1584843831.0,Hey there. Feeling the same here. Random question: have you gotten to that point where you call yourself names etc?
depression,fl57g5c,t3_fmocj1,1584830220.0,"Hang in there and dot let her vicious words get to you. I know: easier said than done.

My dad, every single time I call: "" Sooooo, I bet you haven't gotten over that depression thing yet.....""

Mom: You know, I've got so many more reasons to be depressed and see, I'm not. Just get up and be normal

Etc."
