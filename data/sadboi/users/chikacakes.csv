depression,fojgizn,t3_g6jgq0,1587820263.0,i relate to all the things you said op. it honestly sucks. friends also tend not to check up on me because they think “oh she’s got everything under control” when i dont. i’m merely finishing my tasks for school and at home because otherwise i’d feel guilty for being irresponsible and making others disappointed.
lonely,foj97xr,t1_foj86gv,1587813360.0,i want to but i’m too much of a coward because she tends to get overwhelmed by stuff about being girlfriends. i dont want her to feel that
depression,fofmwo5,t1_fofe59q,1587739128.0,i hope we both get through this though
depression,fofmryx,t1_fofjxjv,1587739058.0,"hii first off, thank you for taking the time to read my rambling. and yea i actually do have that with them that’s why i’m so afraid to lose them. i know deep down that my friends genuinely care and love me since we’ve been through so much together already but yea i think my depression and anxiety just fucks with my head sometimes and i conclude that “yep i’m probably annoying them.” it’s a constant problem and i just wish i would stop overthinking. about the girl, i honestly don’t know what i would do. all i know is that i might not love anyone else the way that i love her. i mean i know i shouldn’t say that because i don’t really know that and that i’m already closing the door for a potential partner that might actually be for me but i just don’t know if i can invest as much again. geez i hope i’m still making sense at this point. i totally get your point about being prepared for anything so i’ll try my best to figure things out. thank you so much. i hope you’re doing well :>"
