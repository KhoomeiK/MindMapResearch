Of course you do, because that's most people! Very few of us have our shit together... even the most attractive, charismatic people are frequently just on the go constantly to keep from being alone with their thoughts (that's one of the worst things most people can imagine)...

also ""I don't have anything"" sounds like another bit of anxiety-brain lying to you... I don't expect you're actually showered in riches, but if it's not liable to bring on a panic attack, imagine you were stripped naked and teleported to the middle of the woods in some other country... you'd start missing a lot of things I bet. Don't listen to your brain's guilt loop about not deserving to feel bad because other people have less, that's not what this is about, but I guarantee you do have things someone else would kill for... I always think about this story about a North Korean refugee who risked his life to stop and grab a plastic soda bottle while running out of the country because a bottle that would never break was the most amazing thing he'd ever seen... would be life changing... and I stop feeling like I have so little.

also, you're 18, you're not supposed to have anything yet really (and ignore the morons with the latest $300 shoes and designer crap... that's bs consumerism and about the least practical things you can can spend money on... same with people whose parents bought them everything... they usually haven't done anything on their own either ) ... you're also expected to make mistakes, it'll almost always be fine if you do... it's about how well you learn from them.

I can personally assure you... working through the struggles when you're younger to have an actual career is 1000% worth it... especially veterinary training, people will always have pets and they will always get sick.

I'd say bail while you can and switch to something useful... but you seem like you're headed into a real education in a real career... college will be a struggle, but also one of the most amazing times of your life make it through that, and things get easier and you get a much bigger say in your life. 

and if you don't enjoy veterinary, don't do it get a boring ass business or nonprofit admin degree or something useful... you can always voulenteer at a shelter on weekends without a degree in animals 

even veterinary trade... you could work with the public, or for a zoo, or a farm, or a conservation effort, domestically or abroad, or in any number of advisory roles? and that's just off the top of my head, I don't know shit about veterinarianism ( praise be the doggos and the floofs, the birbs and the blubblubs )... and there are always all kinds of support roles around veterinary work, and those are probably a safer bet to climb the ladder and get the experience for higher veterinary roles anyway..."

WebAssembly,fo04xqt,t1_fnzrgsf,1587406150.0,"I hadn't heard that, thought i think it's maybe a bit more complicated than that.

My understanding of wasi is not especially deep, but it seems like it's basically a way for makers of things(processors, operating systems, browsers, vms) to allow wasm to be run on directly on their thing... not just in a browser. That also implies a lot of other core functionality like file system access and networking.

This relates to docker, since docker is a way to wrap existing programs, a file system, and networking (and probably some other stuff) for two main reasons I'm aware of:
 1.) increase consistency ( the same docker container running on my macbook vs your windows pc, vs a linux server... the code inside doesn't know or care about the host machine, so long as it does what it's supposed to... just it's own little pocket universe ), and the maintainers of docker and various operating systems can do all the legwork to make sure they support that abstraction, instead of every single developer everywhere...     

2.) isolate the code from its environment and control access... if a bad guy gets onto your system and scans it for stuff to steal... they won't see the stuff in docker unless they specifically go looking for it, and unlike a general purpose computer for bowsing the internet and playing games and such where each program needs its own network access (so the host needs many network ports open ) docker can run one (main) program per container... and restrict what can come in or out and how... so if program A nees port 8080, but has an access vulnerability over port 22... and program b needs port 22... you can run both in containers, and restrict the container around A to only allow port 8080, and be safe. Furthermore, this is configurable bt the person making the package, and doesn't necessarily need to be managed by every user.

the reason i think it's more complicated than ""if we had wasm+wasi we wouldn't need docker"" is... you can install existing apps into docker, it bundles an environment w/ your app, and the interface is really simple... and we're building wasi w/ docker as somewhat of an example of the sorts of problems were encountered while solving a similar set of problems... so w/o dockers success, wasi might never have existed... we can only see so far because we stand on the shoulders of giants as it were.

On the contrary, for the foreseeable future, wasm needs you to have a program written in a compatible language... using primarily supported APIs (or shimming them), and for you or someone else to rebuild them into wasm, maybe even re-implementing the UI and making some (usually) relatively minor concessions to the wasm ecosystem.

This is entirely my take, but it in the near term... it seems more like wasi will make developing and supporting docker easier... if wasi is supported everywhere, and they re-write or port docker to wasm... they don't have a thousand little edge cases to manage anymore (though probably still some subset of the edge cases won't go away )...

In the longer term... if it's similarly performant, maybe docker goes away, and most compilers/runtimes move to start outputting or running on wasm, so developers don't have to make separate builds for the various OSs and tweak them for all the small differences. ( so long as wasi supports similar levels of code isolation for security )... though docker on wasi would still have the benefit of bundling an environment w/ your app, so you don't need to care what version of the host os the the user is running (or in WASI's case... what version of wasi )... but computers are hard so this'll probably take 5 years or more to hit mainstream.

in the very long term... maybe most processors only run wasm... and everything compiles down to wasm... and everything just works, has better isolation, and ultimate portability. That said, there are always reasons why one bytecode to rule them all isn't ideal... any blanket solution inherently can't be optimized for any one situation. Also, the build once, run anywhere concept is rarely the dream it's made out to be... at the minimum, different systems demand different UI... so one app built for both iphone and android still needs the better part of 2 distinct UIs, and even under that, the platforms have very different design philosophies... writing one app that works for both is easy enough, but writing one that doesn't make both feel like they got the short end of a compromise is near impossible..."

why? if you're doing a lot of compute, or wantto  make us of existing c/c++/rust code... it's way faster (if you're only doing low/moderate stick with js... and thread it with webworkers if that makes sense)

how? you compile some c/c++/rust or a handful of other languages to wasm(webassembly) with tools like llvm or emscripten, and use js to load the output, and map the internal functions so you can call them like js functions
