beauty,fptx323,t3_gex3k1,1588900012.0,"Also, for people saying looks don’t matter, I noticed a significant difference in treatment by society from before my high school “glow up” and after. People, especially men, generally treat you better when you are attractive. At least that’s what I feel."
beauty,fptwryl,t3_gex3k1,1588899831.0,"Shit ton of pressure. Add that onto comparing yourself to other girls who fit the Eurocentric beauty standards that is predominant in the United States, let alone most of the world. We get told to eat more if too skinny. Lose the weight if fat. Too pale. Too dark. It really never ends.

I guess the best advice to give women out there is to be confident in themselves, regardless of that other people may say or think. But with all the “ideal”-looking women being flaunted in the media 24/7, it’s hard not to want to make yourself look more appealing in order to be accepted in society like they are."

dating_advice,fpdvsw6,t3_gcjtmc,1588535238.0,Gross lmao he seems like a possessive asshole who’s kinda selfish by wanting you to himself yet caring too much about his own sexual needs to commit to one girl.

I don’t understand how this is acting “slutty.” You are completely dismissing the entire paragraph stating the issue I am dealing with.  Not everything is about gaining followers.

And for upvoting every comment and replying, it’s because I genuinely enjoy having a discussion with these people. And if it’s a compliment, I am replying to be polite. Not everything is for attention and views. And even if this WERE a ploy to get Instagram followers, it’s not going to change how I feel at the end of the day regarding my confidence.

I’ve just been bullied for this my entire life and that comment from him really hurt because I genuinely feel like it’s true. I asked him to tell me what was so “off-putting” about me in terms of dating and he couldn’t think of a single thing besides that. 

I don’t think that my lack of self confidence is what is getting in the way of dating for me. I come across as very friendly and confident, tons of guys ask for hookups, but no one wants a genuine relationship. I highly doubt it’s just my “age range” of boys because there are plenty of people my age that are dating. The guy I’m talking to right now is Italian and he likes me back but doesn’t seem to want a relationship. My insecurities are screaming that it’s because I’m Indian and his family and friends would think it’s weird for him to bring home an Indian girl.

I genuinely think that if he were to have to choose between me and a hot blonde girl, she’d win."
dating_advice,fol2wf8,t1_fokl7rh,1587853820.0,"It’s not that we can’t score dates with other races, it’s just that being Indian (according to him) gives us a significantly lesser chance of obtaining one.

I just wanted him to be brutally honest and tell me, as a good friend, what is so “off-putting” about me as to why I can’t get a guy to commit to me.

He told me that a guy isn’t going to want to commit to an Indian girl when there are smoking hot white girlies out there. I am obviously aware that not all guys are like this- but it really seems like the majority are."
dating_advice,fokfwn2,t1_fokfhkl,1587841321.0,"Hm I don’t know. He gets a ton of girls and it’s like why would he choose the Indian one out of the toooons of White girls he gets? That’s what I think.
