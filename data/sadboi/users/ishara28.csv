SuicideWatch,fqr2xez,t3_gk7spi,1589576593.0,Wow it's in words. When people ask me what's kept me from killing myself I never know how to explain this to them.
AskReddit,fq7pusr,t3_ggjcz2,1589149786.0,Joe Santagato and Cody ko. They're hilarious.
rapecounseling,fq7pnug,t3_gh5vpe,1589149676.0,I have it whenever I see guys with a similar height in a black hoodie. Creeps me out every time.
rapecounseling,fog052j,t3_g76ca2,1587745841.0,I kinda know how you feel. Bc I just started therapy and I had my first session yesterday. And I just ended up breaking down bc of it. Hopefully I'll be able to talk about it without breaking down and feeling like it was my fault one day. And I hope you'll be able to overcome it too.
