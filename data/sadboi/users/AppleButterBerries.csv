OccupationalTherapy,fqrlvth,t3_gjmggn,1589586996.0,Thank you for asking this question. I use these techniques often but never knew how to document it. I took from the other commenter's suggestions in my documentation today!
bipolar,fq8kw82,t3_gh55fr,1589168593.0,"Haha this is me. I call people when I'm feeling chatty. They don't answer. They call back a few hours later, and I'm not in the mood.

bipolar,folmvx0,t1_folmjlc,1587865723.0,"Lol. Interesting. When I wasn't taking it with food, it would knock me out. But once they told me you have to take it with food for it to be effective, I'm super anal about taking it right after dinner as I do not want another psychotic episode. Thanks for all of your input! Very helpful!"
bipolar,folmfzy,t1_folmc7l,1587865438.0,So then do you not take the geodon with food?
bipolar,follxmu,t1_follm6f,1587865107.0,"Thank you! Maybe I just need to up my dose at night. Do you take it with dinner? I used to take 80 mg in the morning and 80 mg at night, but I was so sleepy I couldn't function during the day"
bipolar,follel0,t1_folktzy,1587864768.0,"When I first started taking geodon, no one told me it had to be taken with food and it would knock me out. Idk if that's safe, or if it's a good option, but I'll ask my psychiatrist"
bipolar,folktzy,t1_folkgcf,1587864405.0,"I take 80 mg geodon with dinner and I feel completely normal. I usually eat dinner around 7:30- 8. I go to bed around 10-11 and on a good night I fall asleep at 1am sometimes I don't sleep at all. How many mg do you take? I know it has to be taken with food, so maybe I should just not eat dinner until I'm ready to go to bed?!"

No offense, just mania has never turned out positive for me. Last time I went manic I got $30,000 in debt. It's no joke. It is real and has real consequences"
bipolar,fo5g2rd,t1_fo5fhsh,1587524789.0,"I'm glad you're taking care of yourself and putting your energy to good use! I just see a lot of ""mania"" being thrown around on this sub and it's frustrating for something so serious to be used so lightly. Take care, friend!"
bipolar,fo5f73z,t3_g5nh79,1587524183.0,"Are you sure this is mania and not just hypomania? Mania causes me to car jack people and try to convince the police I need witness protection. Not trying to be a jerk, I know everyone is different, but hypomania gets me funnier and more organized whereas mania causes aliens to suck my energy dry through the power outlet sockets. There's a huge difference"

OccupationalTherapy,fkjfqtz,t3_fh6z3c,1584244591.0,"Introverted OT here. I was devastated and miserable during my fieldworks (schools and inpatient.) I thought about quiting so many times, but the amount of student loans I have keeps me in the field. I've been an OT now going on 5 years and I've worked in many settings trying to find one that suits me. Pediatrics is extremely draining for me. I just can't do it. I've found that geriatrics is much more calm and easy going. The patients that want to be aggressive and refuse, I don't argue with. Patient's have the right to refuse. I'm a firm believer in that. Adult home health is my favorite setting, but it's hard finding full time work. I currently work at a transitional rehab with adults. It's kind of like inpatient, but your sessions are only about 45 min per pt, not 90 min! I love it so much and I'm really glad I hung in there. Don't give up! OT is so broad. I hope you find a good fit!"

I was on Medicaid too, and when I didn't have any insurance at all, I got sick and was in the hospital for a week. That cost me $30,000. that was 4 years ago and I'm still paying it off. I worked as a hostess/to go/and finally waitress for seven years while going to school. School cost me $120,000 for a master's degree not to mention what I will end up paying in interest. I have a good job now, a career, but everything I make goes towards student loans. My grandma told me she paid a couple hundred dollars a semester in college. A lot of things have changed. Boomers call us lazy and entitled, ha! Shortly after I graduated, I was diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. I qualify for disability, but I'm lucky I found a job that accommodates me and I can keep making a decent living because disability checks aren't enough to get by on. I hope I stay well enough to keep working. I love my job. People who think those on disability are leeches are clueless, it's not a lavish lifestyle, it's not enough to live on. I fear having to go to the hospital again for the bills and potentially losing my job. Things are rough. Stay strong and vote!!"
