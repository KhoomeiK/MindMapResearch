Girls I went to high school with announce they’re pregnant and everyone OOHs and AWEs and gets excited, and while I’m happy for them because they are happy and want the child (or call it a “happy accident” or whatever), I don’t feel anything but pity for them outside of that “glad you’re getting something you want”feeling; I hope that makes sense.

Like all I can think about is how much busier and more exhausted they’re going to be, how they’re bodies are going to be changed forever, and how glad I am that I am not them. But at the same time, “good for you, if that’s what you want.”"
