Your first step is: make a work area. And meaningfully sort the items in that work area.

Give yourself enough time for this task, sort those items even if they end up in bins that are floating on top of everything else. They're still in their place, their place just needs to find its place.

Eta: The other strategy is to go through an area and get the low hanging fruit. So you have one bin a d a room stacked full of laundry.

1) you are developing the god complex to compensate for feeling worthless. You'd rather think about how awesome you are, so you push feelings of self hate down and replace them with prettier thoughts.

2) when you feel other people don't respect you, it makes you angry because you really, really don't want to feel worthless, and that's a basic emotional defense.

3) you want the bad guy to die in movies because you don't see the world in shades of gray. To you there's only good or bad, which is in part why you're struggling with points 1 and 2. You can't see yourself as someone who has some good points and some blah points. You either see yourself as nearly godlike, or completely worthless.

I started with understanding dogs.

In other words, I feel nothing 90% of the time. I never used to stand up for myself, I never used to get upset at the injustices that people forced on me. 

So when I get angry I always am so proud of myself, because it means I believe I deserve human rights. 

I still make sure not to wish harm on others, and not to cause harm to others (don't violate autonomy or consent). So for me when someone is angry about injustice, that's my kind of guy. If he can do it without getting petty or violating consent or autonomy *at all*, that's even better. 

I distinguish between that and the outrage of abusive people, where they are angry that they can't take away autonomy of another. Where their outrage doesn't track with the offense (""so much hate here"", when people are giving legitimate reasons for their beliefs) in those cases anger is used to stop listening and protect a privileged world view.

So, I'm not angry about anger, I'm angry about injustices. The way someone is angry and what they choose to be angry about are how I learn about people's character, and I regard other's anger logically and dispassionately, it's just a clue to their character after all."

No toys, no storage supplies, no clothing, no entertainment and no media, unless I will use it immediately.

I like keeping life simple, having fewer choices, it helps with my executive function issues, and I'm just happier not trying to force myself to like the second best things.

But there's still a scar, you might still need meds if an important organ was injured, you might have a limp. But you're healed. I think the soul is similar, we just don't know how similar, or what the limits of healing are. You just decide how far you can go and do that, and forgive yourself and the world of you can't do more."

TheGoodPlace,fh9bl9u,t3_f1beha,1581377486.0,"I don't know how to put this, but I'm going to do my best.

I've always wanted to be a good person. I've always wanted to be a super hero, I've spent most of my life trying to learn about the world and help people (failed a lot, but I meant well, and when I failed, I kept trying to learn, I had a lost of what I needed to work on that I always, checked in on regularly). I don't feel like the show changed anything for me there, but it had made me finally feel seen and loved. 

I was abused a lot in my childhood, a great deal of my trying to save the world comes from trying to be good enough for people to want to try to understand me and I always believed that I just had to be better than everyone else, because the standard for me was just higher, not because I could do it, but because that's what abuse taught me, everyone but me gets friends, everyone but me gets to be happy if I want it I have to work harder *because*. 

But most people don't even try, a lot of people hate me because I don't make eye contact (maybe on the autistic spectrum) or because I don't get their jokes. This is why I identify the strongest with Jason (even though I'm a woman) I also have a bad memory, have a hard time talking, and my executive function is spotty so I sound pretty stupid and look pretty lazy (like Jason). I also have a lot of anxiety about being rejected that turns me into a sort of a blend of Chidi an and Eleanor. It really helped me see how ineffective I am like Chidi, but also see how lonely I am like Eleanor I don't identify with Tahani as much, but part of my defensiveness when I become like Eleanor is to use really shallow reasons to decide not to be people's friends.

And... The way everyone here loves them and has made really interesting insights especially into Jason, I can take all the shitty ways people have strutted around while they feel justified in how they treat me, just because I don't have a diagnosis and I haven't exposed my whole vulnerable life to them so they can strip away my defenses to inspect me and  violate me with their stamp of approval. 

Watching every one here realize they were selfish and try to do better helps a little. But moreover watching everyone love the show makes me feel like they love me, or they would once they learn how to make a little more space in a conversation and in their assumptions (biases) for a scared little abused girl stuck in a woman's body with a brain that isn't quite right."

Basically I'm chill about people and don't care how they look and I like a lot of people as friends, and really appreciate their existence. 

... that is until men like me romantically, I always feel obligated to like them back. And at first it works out ok, because I liked them as a friend, but then after a while I start to nit pick them. It starts out mild, but then gets more and more obscure... their hands are shaped wrong, They didn't punctuate that tweet properly, Their creative works that I once loved, I stop liking.

Yeah, it's all just my brain's way of saying I'm not really that into them and/or that I'm not ready for a relationship.

So you doing this, makes me think that you actually don't like yourself, and so you're trying to sabotage the relationship because you don't think you deserve it, so you're inventing lists and lists of things to ""prove"" how unworthy you are. 

To change it, start here.

""S.O. has known me for x years. He's seen me on my worst days, (list them) and at times when I looked my worst (describe the times) he knows exactly what he's getting into. He chose this for the following reasons (list reasons he's mentioned before for why he likes you), and and they are valid reasons even if I don't understand or believe them. It's not up to me to choose for him. I only need to choose what feels right for my needs, and I want to marry him because (list the reasons).""

1) there is nothing embarrassing about needing a little help. Make sure your mom knows this. Hoarding often gets worse after the loss of a loved one, that's important to recognize.

2) there are therapists (or even just life coaches and professional organizers) specifically for hoarders, no one has to know she's seeing that kind of therapist if she doesn't want them to know.  Come up with your cover story, like ""I just needed help thinking of how to organize my creative projects"" or ""i wanted to make a really meaning memento for xx after he passed but I needed help coming up with something""

The forgetting is weird, because I will always talk about my family when they come up in conversation, but there is always this small part of me that's surprised like ""oh yeah, they probably want me to talk to them, shit I haven't done that"" and when I think back to why? It's because thinking of something to say was too emotionally charged and stressful, so I just never wrote an email back to them and somewhere along the way,  beyond a vague sense of maybe one day wanting tonreconnect, completely forgetting their birthdays, or to reach out to them or that they would have useful input on a situation.

When I was younger, made me I was constantly watching myself doing things, not like I was  actually doing them. I also daydream a lot to avoid dealing with any current feelings of rejection in day to day life, in a way it feels like putting my mind over to the side, and it's part of how I forget my body/family. When I was younger, it was compulsive, I didn't even notice that when I got stressed I'd start daydreaming, or I'd lose time.

But a good way to feel connected (at least to the moment) is to play engaging videogames, once that are appealing to you and sufficiently complex/time sensitive will make you forget about 'self' in that ""live in the moment"" sort of way. It's not identical to actually living in the moment, but watch if your sense of self feels different immediately after playing, and if your mind goes into a ""more comfortable"" mode after a few minutes after playing.

Edit: I guess, now that I think about it, videogames are something I do for a sort of conscious, controlled disassociation. It forces that in the moment feeling which allows me to 'reboot' and reconnect with life after playing."

It's primarily marked by extremely strong feelings, especially a fear of abandonment so strong that it seems reasonable to your panicking mind you to do *anything* to keep people around, but because you're panicking, anything is often gaslighting and emotionally abusive.

But as I said, treatment is possible, cognitive behavioral therapy really really helps, it's not a cure, but it can get you on the right track. You can get better, but you have to be serious about it. Some people with BPD will either never go to counseling, or only go to psychologists to ""prove how sick they're not"" or to get sympathy instead, which is part of why people are so angry and defensive against people with the condition.
