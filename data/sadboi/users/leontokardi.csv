Acknowledging that I (will) have bad days and bad moments has helped me more than ignoring them. And what helps me recognize these feelings is asking questions. Why do I feel this way? Where does this come from? BUT! I try to give these questions a limited attention span. I might know that there is a rational reason to have these feelings, or I might know that there is NO rational reason to have them, but in the end I cannot actually rationalize my feelings, because they are feelings. I can only recognize them, accept that they are there, and go softer on myself. It's okay to have bad days. And if they are recurring, to the point that they are hurting me, then getting in a conversation with myself can help me understand them. As long as I remember my favourite cliché: I am the sky and the bad feelings and thoughts are my clouds and my storms. But they will come and go, cause above it all I am still the clear blue sky."

plantclinic,fj3e6wx,t3_fbbybh,1582980430.0,"Hello dear plant clinic, I'm a plant lover who started getting to know the magic last summer. So basically still a beginner!

I was given this blueberry plant last summer and she was sitting on the southeast-facing windowsill, all happy. When she got too big for the windowsill I moved her a bit further back (possibly mistake one), but she still got direct sun at least one hour a day - when the sun was shining. I'm in the middle of Europe so we don't get too much of that lately... She started looking a bit sad and I thought it might be because she was getting too big for the pot, so (possibly mistake two) I repotted her using a normal flower soil, that I try to keep a bit loose, because that's what the soil she came with looked like. At some point she started losing leaves and I thought it might have to do with the colder months, but now I'm starting to get worried. Can I save her? I usually water her once a week, sometimes week and a half, and the pot has proper drainage. Help please!
