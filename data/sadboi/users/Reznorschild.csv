You're absolutely right though, a lot of the ""Giant skeleton discovered"" newspaper articles are so old that the scientific and archeological insight at the time of discovery is questionable, and then on top of that the Smithsonian is on some shady shit so you can't really go anywhere else. It is sort of validating to know that despite those things the skeletons, remnants, tools and megaliths are seemingly everywhere across the globe. That is some sliver of validation."

Most people know him from Ancient Aliens or his book Chariots of the Gods, but he really digs into petroglyphs, geological anomalies, forbidden zones, and fringe archeological discoveries in his own speeches. Might be up your alley. Good work, these were really interesting to look at. I love reminders that there is still so much happening on Earth no one knows about or can explain.

We might all be ""aliens""...but that's a whole other thing. In the video it looks like, from what I can see (links above) he seems to not only adjust his pants, but tucks his shirt back in before he stumbles off. I've read hundreds of abductee accounts and majority mention that when alleged abductees are returned their clothes are disheveled, inside out, missing, ripped, not even their own, etc. So when I see the WHOLE picture on this particular case (the lights, technical interference with cameras, man returned in fetal position, the vomiting, not returning to work, etc.) the small detail that he is noticeably re-arranging his clothing, adds a lot of credibility to this footage for me."

Not that he SHOULD, but if he had to, my husband would not only get my tampon, but he would help me clean up and insert it if I couldn't. You have to think long term, what if you get hurt and can't bathe yourself or wipe? Is he going to make you feel bad for being injured and treat your needs like an inconvenient thing he doesn't want to deal with? Its probably going to get worse. You need someone who wants to take care of you just as much as you want to take care of them. You're young now but one day your partner will be the only person you have to depend on. I am not saying he can't change. He may, its not your responsibility to wait for that to happen or to help it to. Be good to yourself and know that you deserve someone who thinks you are the most precious thing on earth. I'm sorry he did that to you, he will be too when you leave. He will have one more hint that that behavior is unacceptable and maybe it will help him grow into the man that the woman he ends up with needs. I am speaking from experience with an abusive partner, his behavior was abusive, lacking sympathy and selfish. You deserve better. No one deserves that. Think about it, strangers don't even treat each other that way.
