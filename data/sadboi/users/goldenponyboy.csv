BipolarReddit,fpvwvoh,t3_gftmhn,1588953280.0,"Yes and no!

Yes:

A few years ago, I reached a really, really low point in my life as a result of my bipolar disorder. I developed an ED during that time. Many people generalize that some EDs are about control, and that was exactly it for me. I felt like my life fell apart because I had no self-discipline, so I started heavy-restricting to test/develop said discipline.

No:

My bipolar moods don't really affect my ED, however (maybe except for how easy it does or does not feel to restrict). While definitely related to my ED, I would not say that my bipolar disorder directly affects it (all that much). I think I was always susceptible to an ED, and my bipolar triggered it, but I don't continue to have an ED because of bipolar. I've been pretty stable with my bipolar for the past several years, but I've had the ED throughout."

Idk, they don't say anything to me about it and I don't say anything to them. Generally in life, I've always been on my own/left to take care of and figure out things for myself, whether school, life, self-esteem, mental illness (all complicated by the fact that I have mental illness).

All this is to say that I feel you, hun. It's hard and I know it hurts. You deserve more.

But if I may: sleep is more important than anything right now. Can you get your hands on some melatonin? You need to break the manic/insomnia loop which is prolly just feeding itself at this point. Do you have a psych you can get in touch with? In any case, sleep is step one.

> I'm changing my number

Try not to do anything drastic! I been wilding out this past week, but once I became aware of my episode, I've been tryna reel it in even if the urges are still there. I know it's hard, but when you're on your own you gotta figure out your own self-awareness checkpoints and your methods of containment.

You might also rethink who you're following. For example, I've since stopped following white, Asian, and mixed girls who I followed solely because they were pretty (i.e., not for fashion, makeup, entertainment, etc.).

French,flmgmzv,t3_fppxqf,1585283097.0,"I've found that you simply just keep doing it. You train your ear until you're better at it. It will come!

When my French reached a point where I could make out most of the the words I was hearing but still missed the meaning of a sentence, I started listening to the podcast [InnerFrench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2afwvUMFnsU). It was the first thing I was ever able to understand 100%. This is a moderate speed and he enunciates really well. He also includes a French transcript for each podcast. I'm guessing speed and articulation are the reasons you are having a hard time synthesizing sentences.

My anecdotal tip: podcasts were not the best way for me to improve my listening skills because I found them largely boring (not because I don't like podcasts but because of not being able to fully follow along and really take in the beauty and nuances of the storytelling), which made the whole ""keep at it"" thing difficult. It's easier when you are actually enjoying the media you're consuming. I switched to watching TV shows and French news, and that was *way* better for me. Plus there's visual context and that helps a lot."

It seems that, either way, he is not super interested in you. Is it possible these examples are not representative of your entire relationship and were cherrypicked simply to highlight the problem you're feeling in your relationship? I think you need to determine if there's a pattern of his failing to include you in his life.

>When the quarantine was announced and stated that the bars would all close tomorrow, he went to the bar and did not invite me at all.

This is a big red flag. I've been there before and I've seen it happen to my friends. For example, my ex was celebrating a thing he did and he went to a party with his friends and their respective girlfriends. Lol he didn't even think of me. At the end of that relationship he admitted that he didn't really like me at all. Another example: I had mutual friends with my friend's ex (who were not friends with my friend). The mutual friends posted stories of the birthday dinner they had for the ex. Ex didn't invite my friend and never even told her about his birthday party. She thought he spent it alone because sometimes he just needed his ""alone time"" too. I mentioned the party a few weeks after the fact (because, well shit, I thought she knew??) and she burst into tears. He eventually admitted that he ""didn't really want a relationship"" with her. Your volleyball incident reminds me of this.

I think you should cut your losses now. There's no talking someone into *wanting* to include you in their life and joy. As cliché as it is, (it seems) he's just not that into you. And regarding  my examples and your worry about this neighbor: neither one of our guys had other people lined up. I'm not convinced getting the neighbor out of the picture would make him any more into you.

EDIT: Also, I completely forgot to address the following:

>His dad came in to town and he took his dad to one of the bars and also invited K, with another neighbor couple as well.

Did he not invite you? If not, leave him IMMEDIATELY. Nothing good will come from this relationship, as you are the only one in it."

That's why I thought considering home values would be helpful. If a lot of black people are living in ""low income areas"" but are not low income themselves, then those neighborhoods become skewed toward higher income when you look at the data? It's also oxymoronic to say that a significant number of black higher-income earners live in ""low income"" neighborhoods, isn't it? At that point, aren't they just mixed income neighborhoods? 

However, looking at the prevalence of middle-to-high income-earners in low home value neighborhoods could tell us something.
