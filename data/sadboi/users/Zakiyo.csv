MagicArena,fr2oo7k,t1_fr2ke0l,1589841009.0,I really have not checked that. It is not such a big deal. It is just a little advantage that on the long run can make a difference. Same for agro decks sometimes for them to have made even just few damages at the beginning of the game because they started first and the opponent had not yet played may make the difference but it is only one of many tiny things that make you win or lose.
Amd,fr24flk,t1_fr215nm,1589830977.0,Yhea maybe 160
MagicArena,fr2431t,t1_fr1sp4g,1589830806.0,So my deck is a combo deck so I need two specific cards cards at the same time on my board to do the Â«Â powerfulÂ Â» stuff. So i first need to draw two specific cards for a combo. It helps to start second because when your start second you draw at the beginning of your first turn. Also i play very few cheap cards so the 3 first turns i almost dont play any creatures but ramp. So it would not help me to hit first. So instead i play second and i have one more card.
Amd,fr22xt4,t1_fr1rk7v,1589830244.0,800
MagicArena,fr1qm4i,t3_gm4tr4,1589824280.0,"My deck is better when second. It is so fucking fun man it is green white and black deck with liliana, cavaliers and ramp. I sacrifice a lot of knights and i use the enchantment [[knight charge]]. And i bring it back every time with [[cavalier of down]]. And i use [[teysa karlov]] and [[conclave cavalier]]

It is basically a combo deck."
Amd,fr1ozx0,t3_gm4yzc,1589823504.0,Ohh and if you upgrade consider upgrading also your power supply
Amd,fr1ojm4,t1_fr1n3ta,1589823287.0,"Yikes check your sources mate. Its exactly the opposite. Intel as a slight edge stricly for gaming if you do anything else with a comparable amd processor it will wreck it.

For the upgrade i see everyone says to uprade your cpu but, i would suggest you upgrade your gpu first. It wont help you for beam ng but i5 from intel at 4.2 ghz is still relevant compared to your 970. What i suggest is that you buy an invidia card like the 1660 and you stream with it instead of your processor. So you wont have to upgrade your mother board, your ram and your cpu. And if you were to upgrade your cpu right now the 970 would hold you back A LOT. And wait a bit much to upgrade the cpu (i would probably wait until amd releases ddr5 cpu) it can still hold on for a bit."

If you have a water cooling on your cpu and the rad exhausting on the top it will be perfect and for the gpu if you can fit the two bottom fan it would also be perfect but as you mentioned it may not fit. It should not be an issue tho just not the best case scenario. Even if you dont have a water cooling and the bottom fans wonâ€™t fit your case if you have two intake fans in the front, two exhaust fans on top and one in rear it will be fine."
Corsair,fqv9ehe,t1_fqv8djs,1589672531.0,Ahh ok soo the best To know the fan direction is really to put your hand in front of it. And you want it to push the air inside the case.
Corsair,fqv7eyi,t3_gl4hy2,1589671387.0,Im not sure of the way those fans blow if it was corsair fans i would know but anyway. You check it is pretty easy and you must change it if the exhaust is toward front of your case and you have intake fans also. I would suggest to you to put it in the top. And even if it is fine you should put either the rad on the top or the two front fan on the top it would be better because you dont need two fans on a rad.
