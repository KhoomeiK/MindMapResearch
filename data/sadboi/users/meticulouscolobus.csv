schizoaffective,f4fg2jc,t3_dkc37a,1571569943.0,Yes definitely. So interesting to hear someone else describe it so similarly to how I feel.
schizoaffective,f48gdew,t3_djrqof,1571438628.0,"Nope. Much better without the psychosis or the mania. And I don’t feel like I’ve lost my personality at all, I don’t know where that saying comes from. I’m more me without the psychosis and moods weighing me down"

schizoaffective,f3fivl5,t1_f3ewou3,1570897800.0,I thought it was too until I took meds and it stopped suddenly. Used to always feel exhausted from the noise all the time
schizoaffective,f390v8z,t3_dg06rx,1570742322.0,I was living in Glasgow and it took a month for my referral. Maybe it differs depending where you are.
schizoaffective,f2zyw2r,t3_dezgrr,1570542351.0,I would recommend trying acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) because it sounds like you’re currently dealing with anxiety by avoidance which will potentially make it worse. Try radically accepting your anxiety instead of focusing on coping strategies that would be my advice.

My running internal dialogue is fine and unchanged. I can control it.

I also used to hear whispers of someone calling my name outside my head. These also stopped with medication."

They said it doesn’t sound like DID but I “miss” chunks of time where I try to look back and it’s like a blank space of time I can’t remember anything. It really gets me when I do things (like make tea, put something on a desk) and then “come back” and see the changes it freaks me out."
