depression,fi0wilw,t3_f5uxky,1582046200.0,"Depression for me is like drowning. I’m keenly aware of what’s going on and sometimes I know that how I feel is irrational but it doesn’t stop this crippling sadness. It comes over you and it truly keeps me from breathing right. It’s like being in a constant state of mourning but what your mourn is something you’ve never had (happiness) but it’s something you’ve always wanted and at times it feels so close to grasp but it’s not ever really there. Drowning in an ocean of emotion and you’ve got no idea where the shore is. 

Anxiety is a little easier to describe: imagine your worst fears (homelessness, house fires, loved ones being murdered, etc) and then imagine you were convinced all these were going to happen to you at any moment, at all times. That’s pretty much how I feel: Every day I leave my house I fear it will burn down when I’m gone, I’m convinced I will die in a car accident every time I drive... it’s overwhelming."

No one talks about the negative side of parenting but a lot of parents feel the way you feel now and guess what: they’re okay too. Find someone you can talk to openly about the negative feelings you have. Be honest with yourself what you don’t like about parenting. Mourn the loss of the life you once had but don’t close the door to a new life you may gain. It’s hard. It’ll remain hard but on that note my siblings find parenting easy and their kids fistfight on the front lawn. Its suppose to be hard I think; that’s what makes it worth it in the end.
