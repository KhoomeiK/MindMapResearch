I came out when I was your son's age and it would have meant the world to me to have my parents be supportive of choosing to be myself. Instead we hardly talked for almost two years and it's still uncomfortable. Just remember that literally nothing has changed and he REALLY needs to know you support him. 
As far as telling him you know, I would just make positive comments when you see things about the lgbtq community. He'll know you're supportive and tell you when he's ready. Coming out is terrifying and if he knows he has nothing to worry about he's going to tell you sooner rather than later."

You're just now figuring who you are and being in your twenties is confusing af. So my advice would be to have patience with yourself and learn to love yourself. Looks are not permanent and the people who rely on them are shallow. Another REALLY important thing, don't expect people to judge you before you get to know them. And if they do judge you then they're doing you a favor by showing you that you don't need to waste your time on them. Quit worrying about your looks, you're fine I promise. You gotta love yourself before you're going to be able to let anyone else love you. If you don't believe you're deserving of love you will reject love from others. If you worked out a shit ton and had a ""hot"" body then yes guys would probably jerk off to you...

Life is to short to worry about the opinions of others. Also HUGE lesson I've learned is that most people like me for me, especially the ones who I'm sure are homophobic. Sometimes there are idiots but the majority of the time I'm the one judging people before even giving them a chance to like me."
askgaybros,fl51xz8,t1_fl4ytpg,1584826657.0,Lol seeing as this got down voted I'm gonna guess people see it as problematic. Although I completely understand where you're coming from and wouldn't WANT to let it offend me it would still kind of hurt since you're associating who I am with something that's bad or stupid. Most gay people don't want to be seen as oversensitive so they probably won't say anything to you and will act like it's fine.
