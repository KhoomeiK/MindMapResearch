I definitely want to say it but it all comes jumbled out. So I figure, for now, I can write it down in a journal. Everything I want to say and then read from that journal instead of just showing him and perhaps that will help me feel more comfortable. 

I have improved in some ways. I grew out of some toxic habits but it’s just about making peace with myself and learning to be honest, cutting away from the overactive imagination that my mind uses as a band aid and whatnot. 

We are doing DBT , meditation, mindfulness and living in the present! And according my therapist it’s not reaching insight or being self aware that’s my problem but more just about living in the moment and I know I have a long way to go... so much to address but I don’t want to be 32 and doing all this work + more later when I could have done it now.

You can get it through BBC or whatnot and it’s really good. This made me fall for the brits and their excellence of comedy. 

• Crazy EX-GF - it’s not for anyone but musical / comedy series that tackles mental illness and sexuality in a way that many before it failed to do so. Gives a raw and accurate perspective of someone w/ BPD 

• Parks and Rec - Almost everyone knows this one and it’s nice to do a rewatch of a series. I appreciate it more the second time around.

CasualConversation,fqbqdke,t3_ghz2lb,1589241892.0,"Yes! Most definitely. 

In real life, I never had the best of luck with friends. I had been bullied, taken advantage of, used, and tossed around and stepped on like a rock on the sidewalk. Last time I had IRL friends I was betrayed and it messed with me so much I developed actual paranoia for a year due to the extreme stress of the situation and I had really bad anger issues and toxic venom spewing from me because of it.

I had met many friends dear to me online. A friend I’ll never forget is one when I was 11 and he was the first one I was ever able to truly connect with. And he’s stuck with me ever since. My first love was an online experience. All my relationships have been and I 100% don’t regret that. They taught me about what truly matters in a relationship. I mean, I did have a brief IRL relationship but someone 30 min away from me couldn’t make me feel so deeply connected and in love with them like someone 1,400+ miles away from me could. 

I had a few good other friends online too. Sadly one passed away due to cystic fibrosis and the other passed away from a drug overdose before he got to turn 18 (we did go to the same school but didn’t become friends till adding eachother online). I have an online friend who I feel connected to and I met my group of friends now in a group chat back in 2015. We are all connected still. I also have friends i met back in mbti groups on Facebook and we are all still connected to. Have another friend I met in 2013 and he has helped me with food during this time. I also have another friend I met at the same time. Saw her have three kids and I even gifted her something for the last one <3 

So yes, it definitely is possible.

I just think it’s still considered very taboo. 

But there is nothing wrong with such experiences. None of them mean any less to me whatsoever."
CasualConversation,fqbpiro,t1_fqbopgt,1589241427.0,"This right here^ I’ve learned not having kids aren’t the end of the world. You should ask her this question: do she’s want to be a *parent* or does she just want to have *kids* ? Cause to want to be a parent vs wanting to have kids are two different things. 

I definitely think you should be honest with yourself and what you want for your own life. We understand that you love her and she’s such an important dynamic of your life, but love alone isn’t enough to merit a relationship working out. 

It is a tricky fence and maybe I recommend seeing a therapist for one session to address this? Sounds like you two could use a professional to help address your issues, concerns which should force her to open up and listen to you and see if she’s willing to sacrifice not having kids just to be with you for a lifetime like you are her. 

Seems drastic but I also know nothing good can come from wanting to have children just to keep someone around cause you don’t want to lose them.

You might not regret having kids, but if you do.. it’s a choice you’re stuck with for life."
CasualConversation,fqbk7o5,t3_ghtlbu,1589238527.0,"You know what, yes!

It’s ok. But liking one thing doesn’t mean you automatically hate the other or blahblahblah.

CasualConversation,fqbjiur,t1_fqb22k9,1589238156.0,"To be fair, TV shows and films are finally starting to get it right. 

There is a show called My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. The title seems incredibly annoying and cliche, but in a way it is serving the purpose of irony and the show is about this character and how she clearly has mental issues and toxic behaviors but the show does well in doing its researching, slaying stigma about the disorder (Borderline Personality Disorder) and giving you insight into the other characters as well. It does it’s job in telling you that a happy ending isn’t going to save you, a man isn’t going to save you but they also don’t go with the whole “I choose me!” thing either that’s become quite common. 

Another show that doesn’t do this and, in fact calls it out in the show too, is Bojack Horseman. The writers made damn sure to address this issue in a storyline of one of the seasons basically saying, “Hey, this character is not an excuse for you to be shitty. They’re supposed to serve as a wake up call for you.” And they make that oh so blatantly clear.

So I am glad a few shows and movies are finally starting to go in the right direction. It’s hard but not impossible either."

These lyrics come as incredibly personal to me and 100% relatable given I am in a current situation in which I was in a relationship where I kept pushing the guy away. I never could understand or come to accept his affection and if often be a brick wall towards giving and receiving such affection. It was through the fights, the push-pull dynamic and being so stuck in my head that I couldn’t see the pain I was causing him or making him feel not good enough that after I impulsively ended the relationship he was just done and didn’t want the relationship anymore. This made me feel really bad about myself but also made me realize some harsh truths about myself and that I’m the heartbreaker and was projecting all my fears and whatnot onto him and fulfilling a self-fulfilling prophecy that I am “hard to love, easy to leave” thus deciding to go to therapy and avoiding relationships for a while until I can truly improve."

I’d walk to the stores and to the cinema quite often. I’d walk pretty much everywhere but this virus situation really made me incredibly sedentary and this caused me to become more out of shape than I could have thought. 

Plus it doesn’t help when I have depression and even that can make doing the things I *want* to do... really suck. So I never kept going. 

But this time I took control of my own mind and said, “Nope, we are going for a walk.” And soon it will be ok again! 

But thank you. Again, it’s the act of doing something outside your comfort zone and whatnot. 

It’s like paying a phone bill. You wish you could just put off the phone bill and use that money to buy a video game you really want. You buy the video game and it’s instantly rewarding. You’re enjoying playing the game but then you’re out of phone service and you don’t know have the money to pay your phone bill anymore. And then suddenly the action of buying that game (receiving instant gratification for it) doesn’t feel so good.

Whereas you decide to pay the phone bill and it doesn’t feel as rewarding instantly. You don’t feel too good about it cause you wish you had bought that game. It makes you realize how spread thin your wallet is that you had to choose paying a bill vs video game but then you have phone service and you’re in better financial health in the long run and it feels better over time seeing you reap the results of a wise decision.

DecidingToBeBetter,fow4u7x,t1_fow2a7s,1588113034.0,It was nice to get outside. My allergies and immune system begins to suffer a lot if I stay in the house for too long. I’m not a fan of the blistering heat but that’s ok! I know daytime works better for me cause otherwise I’d just put it off till night time and find a way to not go
DecidingToBeBetter,fow4pg2,t1_fow46oi,1588112965.0,"It’s not the walk itself that’s bad. It’s the action of *doing* something for once that is not within the safety of my own bubble. The fact that it’s out of my comfort zone to exercise when I’ve been sedentary for a long time. I’d just sit around and say, “tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow...” but then eventually I got so embarrassed by talking up a storm and doing nothing that I just decided to get up today and go for a walk. Even if it left me absolutely winded, especially if it was the first time in a long time that I am doing something out of my comfort zone. 

It sucked because, again, I’d rather have been in the comfort of my own home away from the sun and its scorching heat. But I did it. That’s what matters most of all. 

Though yes now I have momentum haha and I will continue to build that up for sure!"

My favorite movie in terms of Horror: As cliche as it is, I’m going to have to go with Scream because it is incredibly self-aware and pokes fun at itself and the tropes of the genre, but the main character is also kind of pretty smart. And that’s rare in horror films like this, even today. 

But in terms of originality and actually, truly horrifying: Candyman. 

In terms of bloody clever: Black Christmas, the original. Maybe not horrifying deep down, the main character is incredibly smart for her time and Scream actually reminded me a bit of this movie so maybe Scream was influenced by Black Christmas? No idea given I don’t really tend to dig deep for such information.

A favorite movie in general: Another cliche response, but I’m going to go with Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. When I first watched this film, I really didn’t like it. The second time through I was like, “Yeah ok it’s not too bad. I get it now, sort of.” And then I made the decision to buy the shooting script for it after a break up and in reading the shooting script the movie absolutely hit me in a way i thought it never would. Now I’m going through another break up. Eerily similar stances and I’m the Clementine of this situation and I 110% truly understand and deeply appreciate that film now. It just punches you straight in the heart and the punch occurs so suddenly, you don’t have time for any final words or thoughts. You just sit there for a while after the movie and take some time recuperate and let it sink you in further and causes you to look within yourself, within others, and why your previous relationships maybe didn’t work out. It’s a bloody emotional trip."
DecidingToBeBetter,foqitmt,t3_g8ugsi,1587994544.0,"I was with a guy who was really good to me, truly loved me and it was a very healthy experience until BPD came calling and I realized I wasn’t healed and I was in a year long denial of having BPD and this relationship brought that to the table. He gave me so many chances but alas I made it so hard to love me that it was easy for him to leave me. Thus goes the self fulfilling prophecy of fear of abandonment. 

It was a fair situation given I broke his trust, his heart and hurt him many times. I feel like, as self aware as I am, it’s never gonna work out for me cause I lack willpower and I’m definitely addressing this to my therapist today. I’m in DBT and I’ve realized a lot about myself since the break up nearly a month ago. I’m doing better but have yet to forgive myself on this 100% Way to go for improving and constantly working on yourself. 

I hope to be able to be a part of a healthy relationship as a functioning human being one day. That’s the dream."
DecidingToBeBetter,foodlo4,t1_fonckj3,1587937086.0,"I know it sounds horribly cliche, but I suppose it’s cliche for good reason and these are simply tools to help you get there but I know it’s going to take a whole lot of reflection from within and a bunch of ugly realizations about oneself but that’s where self-forgiveness comes in. Just know you have a whole lot to offer and you do deserve more than those type of guys. <3 Definitely take this time to be single and learn what love means to and the way you come to love yourself is the standard you should hold others up to as well so you know that they’re real about you and they’re healthy for you but also that they actually love you and wants to be equal with you. 

We got this!"
DecidingToBeBetter,fon90ck,t3_g8fsb1,1587914810.0,"Hi, OP.

I am in a very similar stance to you. Instead of choosing guys who are low-income/drug abusers, I would just avoid physical relationships in real life and stick to finding people over the internet. I found some really good guys who didn’t care about my looks or my weight, but the problem is I am mentally ill and just couldn’t love myself. I have a fear of abandonment and a bunch of unhealthy behaviors that caused me to lose so many relationships that had the potential to last. I couldn’t love myself. Hate my body and my face so I hid online, never really showing my face. In the beginning, I catfished. And then I realized how awful it was so I decided “Well, I don’t like my face. So I’m just going to not show myself at all.” I posted a body pic once and a lot of people were incredibly supportive and cheering me on for it. Same with my face and displaying features I have insecurity issues about... Again, people naturally flocked towards me for that reason alone. I suppose because it takes a lot of guts and getting out of ones own comfort zone to show parts of yourself that you’re not happy with. 

I guess the first step to any sort of journey is self-awareness and realizing that it all comes from within. The hard part of loving yourself is the fact that you have to learn to accept yourself as you are now. Otherwise, the journey is only going to be so much harder. It helps to avoid harsh language too. Instead of saying, “I’m ugly and I’m fat. I brought this on myself,” how about, “I have physical features about myself that I don’t like. I have fat that I want to get rid of. Okay, now how can I better appreciate myself in the present moment?” 

I say embrace your physical features and embrace your body. I have these thick and wild, bushy eyebrows that most made fun of me for growing up. But then as I got older people began complimenting me on it and so I’d go the salon, get it waxed and trimmed to bring out my natural arch shape. You can always use a little bit of make up to bring out, or enhance features, that may not naturally pop. But also I just highly recommend you learn to look outside yourself and realize that yeah, we can’t change our faces, but we can change the way we think about ourselves. If we continue to be harsh on ourselves, we’re just going to keep doing things that are bad for us. 

I’m sure you’ve heard of this quote from The Perks of Being A Wallflower, but: We Accept The Love We Think We Deserve.

Just because you are someone who is out of shape or someone with features like that of Angelina Jolie/Scarlett Johansson... it doesn’t mean that you deserve to date men who treat you like shit and settle for less in doing so. 

I think we have to learn to be honest with ourselves here. The love and life we want and desire doesn’t come without self-acceptance, self-love and work... a whole shit ton of bloody ruthless effort on our part.

We have to find a way to just **do** what we need to do. Do not worry about not having any willpower and motivation in the beginning. It will build itself along the road. Progress isn’t linear, either. We’re only human after all. All you really got to have in the beginning is a sense of self, a strong desire to change, and some tools in your box.

Thankfully, Reddit has plenty of subs for weight loss, diet, hobbies, self-love, etc. there’s so many resources and I know mindfulness/dialectical behavioral therapy has been a massive benefit to most people lately. 

I do recommend going through professional therapy while on this self-love journey but I get not everbody can afford it and then the waiting lists can be long, but honestly nobody can teach you how to love yourself... but we can help you find a way to get there and support you throughout this journey. 

And there’s tons of resources and people on here you can reach out to. I’m not exactly sure where I was going with this, but I saw a bit of myself in you and I just want you to know that you have people going through this too. 

I suppose for tips... 

- FORGIVE yourself. It’s going to take time, but you just got to say, “Yeah I made some mistakes. I’m not happy where I’m at in life, but instead of beating myself up about it, I’m going to forgive myself.” You got to be easy on yourself otherwise, again, self-love is going to be hard to obtain.

- Let go and stick to your guns.. let go of things and people that are no longer serving you beneficially. If you find yourself in a situation where that thing or person is tempting you into unhealthy behaviors, stick to your guns. This is an excellent way to build willpower and respect for oneself.

- practice self-compassion. Please, please, please go easy on yourself. Notice that you do have beautiful physical traits and learn to embrace your body now so that when you get to the body type you want to be, you’ll be that much more thankful and appreciative of the work you put yourself through. 

- Start with the most basic of needs. Make sure you’re eating well and nutrition / portion size is being met. Make sure you are getting proper sleep. Start exercising even if only 5-10minutea a day at first. You’ll see how those 5-10minutes are extra beneficial in the long run. Baby steps, yeah? 

These are just a few of many ways to help the self-love journey but above all please forgive yourself and go easy. It’s not a simple thing to do, but believe me... it does help. 

Sorry for the long response. But hopefully something here helps, even if only one thing. <3"
