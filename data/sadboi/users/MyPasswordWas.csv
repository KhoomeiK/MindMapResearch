Mental health isn’t something to bring someone else down with. That was weak of whoever you are. Especially if that’s what you choose to support your point of view with. My life experience has several traumatic experiences and I’ve had life changing experiences that happened in my most formidable years of life without ever given the time to turn around to grieve. 

Also, if me and my friends are quarantined and aren’t sick you can go complain all you want if you don’t want us to slip n slide. That’s so petty to look at what else someone else does not knowing them and making a judgement call. Especially when you don’t know what they do on a day to day basis.

I have trouble keeping appointments a lot too because I’ll do a codependency stint by agreeing to an appointment time that doesn’t necessarily work for my schedule but I don’t want to not get one scheduled. 

Then I get stressed, tell myself I’ll make the time and put it in my phone calendar on the drive home and forget about it all until I miss the appt.

First off understand you only live one time, having someone like him is something so special. Cherish what you have and remember that you’d do anything to win what you want out of your marriage. Remember it’s your best friend and who else would you rather work hard with when there’s work to be done other than your besty?

Options I think of:

Go to him and see about marital counseling? Find a counselor you both like?

See if you can step out of your comfort zone and think about maybe watching porn together? Maybe spice up the sex life? Surprise him with a fantasy of his if he will open up to you about his favorite things?

Write a letter to yourself about the little things you love about him. Sit and spend some time in a bubble bath and just think of your favorite moments together over the years. Really hone in your mind how deeply you love and care for your man. Write down things that make you hurt the worst, write down the things that make you feel so loved or thankful for him.

Just my thoughts from a single 25m who is a romantic and can’t wait to spoil someone one day!! 

Best of luck to you both"
