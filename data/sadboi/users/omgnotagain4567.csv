On the other hand, potato salad ist often paired with wienerwurst ( hope thats the right word), there should be a vegan version."

I would eat regional food, if I could afford it (which I can't), I don't eat rice either, because it causes so much CO2-emission. And i do not have the time to fact check every single decision. So I assume things here and there and stay informed in the best effort. Ethical learning is a life long journey, I think."

depression,foy8bgp,t3_ga2tnb,1588167562.0,"I was also a software engineer before crisis. I really hate the Idea that apps can ever replace human contact and caring which is the most healing experience I ever had. Yes I know, people say it should not replace human contact, but help additonally. Nevertheless health insurance companies in my country already think to push Apps to people. What can be more depressing, than getting such apps pushed to you. In my experience, and I used a lot of those apps, they are always insufficient and disappointing. If you want to help, try to help in Person.

Also, as far as my therapists told me, screen time mostly increases depression."
BPD,fmfvybc,t3_fuxiyx,1586035978.0,"I had these problems before. It meant for me that I hadn't made peace with it. For me it helped to write diary. To get it all out. Even if it meant to write the same stuff over and over. Over time I started to accept these things. Maybe this would help you too.
Also therapy helped a lot. It takes a lot of time, though."

BPD,fln6nq0,t3_fptyl5,1585310826.0,"I had the same discussion with a therapist a few days ago. This is what she told me.

It is unrealistic and too much pressure to expect to stop it all at once. This would lead to even more consumption.
Instead, she recommended to postpone the decissions a little at time. Two hours not buying stuff. Then the next two hours. The timeframe goes what you feel comfortable with. Could be 15 minutes, could be 24 hours. It gives a feeling of control. Do not make plans over more than 2-3 days.
She also told me that those actions are decisions I do. Every postponing of unhealthy behavior is a success and that it's necessary to be aware of the success feeling.
Hope this helps. Trying it myself right now to not shop online all day long."
BPD,ffd3fxh,t3_esynji,1579812663.0,"I know this, but for me it's due to depression. Before that I did songwriting and the easiest way to be creative was to be brutally honest. It does not matter what you write or paint or whatever. Let go of judging yourself. My mum is a musician and as shitty as she was, she gave me the best advice. Sometimes it's not about quality but about quantity. At this time I took inspiration by very old punk bands and made my music as simple and stupid as I could. The honesty thing made people like it. 
Hope it helps. 
Nevertheless, depression is a bitch and can kill any creativity. Sadly..."

BPD,fejkhjb,t3_eph8v4,1579177922.0,"I don't like the ""don't go in a relationships""-advices. Relationships are an essential part of the human life.  There might be times to be in your own and get to know yourself. But why cripple yourself even more by forbidding yourself the joy of relationships. Borderline is crippling enough. I currently started relationship again after a year of searching for myself and learning a lot. Now, of course, I struggle with abandonement issues again. But it's  a chance to learn these things."

depression,febmp2k,t1_febjqqn,1578960488.0,"Still thinking about it. Please go, especially if suicidal thinking increases slowly. Even if you do not get your phone. Doctors at the hospitals like to get you there without the detour around the ER. Also, as I experienced it, suicidal thinking can spin really fast to action and to not wanting any help anymore. Also, if you go voluntarily, you can always leave, even the closed ward (after talking to doctor). This is not the case if you are odered by court, which happens, if you come from the ER because of suicidal action.
Speaking from experience in Germany."
depression,febjqqn,t3_eo76it,1578959555.0,"Maybe it depends on the country you life in. Where I was, you could have your phone even in the closed ward and there was also a free phone (not mobile) for the patients. They wanted us to stay in contact because it's healthy."
BPD,fe0t462,t1_fdxn5ah,1578818316.0,"I don't believe that. The fact that you wrote here and reached out for help says that you are no monster. Monsters don't care, they do not seek help, they do not really suffer or have empathy and enjoy abusing other people. 

There will be people who like you for who you are. You just need to find them. Maybe they are already there."
BPD,fdvcozk,t3_en47n1,1578746022.0,"The internet, with all it's stupid clickbait articles formed a very skewed image of bpd. The diagnostic spectrum of bpd is very wide, and it fits to so many different people. You are still yourself, and good people like you, really define what people with bpd are like. Not the stupid public notion about the condition. Nearly all mental disorders have their prejudices. For example, autistic people are not selfish assholes as Sheldon Cooper, and also people with bpd are not generelly abusive. When I told my SO about my diagnosis I also told him not to believe the articles if he googles it, but to get to know me personally, and if he needs information to ask me or get a book from the library, because they are less judgemental. He sees me as a person, and not as an illness, and this is what good people do.
People who discard you because of your diagnosis are not worth your time (nevertheless i would not recommend to start with this information as an icebreaker)"
