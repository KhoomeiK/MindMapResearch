It has something to do with the intrinsic betrayal of our trust at in our developmental stage. There is a part of us that doesn't individuate and stays the betrayed child we were. That child is helpless and doesn't know how to respond to the world or to protect themselves. Because of that that child who is still a part of you and comes out when one drops ones guard as one would with a mate, often doesn't take notice of it when some one crosses a boundary. They still face the world as ""Tabula Rasa"" (blank slate) even if they have otherwise grown into an adult. 

It has something to do with learning and self teaching. In normal situations one repeats something until one masters it. That is impossible to do on your own when it happens at such a young age and involves another betraying you. You have to practice being present and taking a stand on a boundary. Until you learn more make up a boundary and try to learn how to enforce it. That will help with confidence and as you learn more with enforcing the real boundaries you need.

If you want sobriety use the Big Book. It instructs you about seeking help of medical and other professionals for things related to your general well being. Being generally well helps when doing the work of getting sober.

Wow I hope that felt good. You made me feel good to hear so much anger expressed so clearly. I usually cannot be that clear. 
I'd say you should work on remembering that all people are people. First Nations people had not populated to the point of developing societies like in the old world but they did do all the same crimes to each other that all people have done to each other never the less. They held slaves, subjugated women, murdered etc... And as it is in the whole world, it is not everyone who is or was like that. But the fear that the few who do these things causes often gives them more power than their numbers indicate it should. You are a human being just like the rest of us. 
You are not at fault but the only thing you can control in most of those situations is how you see it. People do not do bad things because of their heritage, skin color, hair type, skull shape etc. They do it to cope with their inner self and how that inner self sees the world and feels about themselves in it. Avarice and greed are drives that come from fear/insecurity and a strong desire to make ones self feel safe. Rarely do those driven by that fear and insecurity display signs that someone not knowing them might recognize as insecurity and fear. You have to first know that fear and insecurity cause that behavior to be able to see the connection.

Take notice of your physical environs. Notice what your body feels like. If you are seated what the chair feels like to your body. What the air smells like. The light. What you can see. List the items you see in your mind. The sounds you hear.

As for rumination, I get trapped there once in a while. Mostly its intermittent and goes away after I have a strong reaction to a memory popping in from Tralfamador and I feel the humiliation, anger, resentment... anew. It usually goes away right after that in a few minutes. The main thing I do when I have an annoying loop going is distract myself with something. I try to make sure it is something constructive, but if its bad whatever works works. Mostly I watch documentaries, or I do laundry, or wash dishes by hand or vacuum, or?? anything mundane or necessary that you need to pay attention to to do correctly. 

Alcohol definitely won't help it will only make it worse long term. The reality of making the pain go away at the time of consumption is soon replaced by a dreadful anticipation of something that takes more and more alcohol to obtain until no amount of alcohol works at all and the bad feelings are once again permanent and there is the added pain and feelings of humiliation from what ever has taken place while drunk.

I am dam smart and know how to read a room I have no idea what most of you were taught from 0 to whatever age it is kids are allowed to learn on their own within the boundaries established by then.

When I was at the 2nd foster someone normal must have noticed something about me as I was sent to a doctor for evaluations. It must have been near a med school as her staff all young I now infer were students feared for my safety if I were to be left alone with her at the 3rd or 4th visit. I infer from that that my apparent symptoms going away when the students were normal to me and engaged with me like I was normal brought out my natural abilities and she somehow convinced herself that I was faking whatever those symptoms were. Probably the fawn response.

What's more proof to me that all my time in foster care was all about abusing and punishing me for things I never did was when I got triggered to remember and I eventually recalled having been sent to that doctor which led me to finding her and calling. She answered the phone and I stated my name and was about to say why I had called and she screamed in anger and fear ""How did you find me?! At the time I was still a mess from the triggering process and what was coming back to me and it did not register right away what had just happened. I went forward as if it were a normal question not screamed at me and told her. This gave her time to regather and she pretended it was nothing and told me all records are destroyed. It didn't register with me that she had instantly recognized my name nearly 40 years later etc until afterwards. Apparently she still does not like me or something happened to her because her students reported her. I do not remember what she looks like I only remember her students talking to each other about how they were going to protect me from her. Apparently they felt I was in physical danger from her.

My abuse was specific to me. The people involved had personal stake in preventing me from developing normally to make sure I could not report what had been done to me in ""protective"" custody. I think the doctor was manipulated by playing her known personality traits to get her to do whatever she did. I have no idea what the results of those visits were. But honestly most foster kids face the same things, being alone among people who just assume they are good therefore anything they say or do is good and the bad people. Individuals need individual connection that is long term and stable that sees, meets and acknowledges their personal needs and gives them safety to grow and test the world out so they can become well adjusted adults. Just being nice and giving them food and shelter is not enough for any person to develop properly.

So yea good that your experience is what it is. But you do not know what anyone is, or knows until you ask directly or tell them so that you know they know the thing you need them to know. Even then there is no guarantee they will properly understand it unless you take the time to make sure they do. Again by being explicit and not assuming anything and testing to see they know how to apply the information. Evil people get by all the time because normal folks never bother to ask and just assume goodness."

You can control how you think and behave. Just be nice to yourself when you make mistakes. I think we can be overly self critical by expecting ourselves to have done better before we are actually able to do better. :)"

The reason for gravitating to people like this, similar to those who abused us was explained to me as ""familiarity"". Even though abuse hurt us we feel most safe in places and situations that we lived in as children. The reason is that it is familiar to us. That familiarity lets us feel like we have something reliable and known and that is where feelings of security come from. This can be true even if we know we are not safe and secure.

The therapist might have suggestions. AA is free. Stick with women's meetings or with women in coed meetings until you know what is going on. You meet the same kinds of people you met in bars at AA.

I would expect the anorexic person had their power taken away or was imposed upon by someone abusing their authority or was abused in some way they were powerless to fight back against externally. So one does powerful things internally. It isn't always good for us and it is difficult to change because it is a source of power for a person who still feels powerless. I imagine it goes on after abuse stops as it then suffices as a coping mechanism.
adultsurvivors,fj6vtl9,t3_fbqksd,1583081249.0,"I'd suggest you get a psychiatrist or therapist. I am not sure if there is a different professional designation in French. Talk to them and express your desire for justice.

When I reported remembering I was immediately confronted with the assumption that I had ""recovered"" the memories. Some even seemed to have assumed I had been in therapy to do so. I had not. I had been triggered to remember by people in authority over me gaslighting me and lying to me and otherwise using abuse of their authority to mess with my mind to set up circumstances in which they could further abuse that authority to further injure me. I found out later that I had unintentionally exposed a few decades of organized embezzling by a large group of government employees and private professional orgs which they had ownership in or got paid from.The paranoia of being crooked for that long and innate bigotry led them to imagine things about me which they acted on. The reality of how I behaved and what I said was labelled as some sort of trick or ignored as nothing they said or did matched with that reality. This so resembled the years of focused psychological and physical abuse I endured as a child it made me remember the stuff that had taken place before the day that was always my first day of continuous life memory until then. 

I find that anyone who uses terms that are other than forgetting and remembering are changing the topic from the fact of having forgotten then having remembered. I wouldn't even say ""traumatic amnesia"" as that term is an explanation not a stating of fact. I assume it would have the same effect in French as ""recovered memory"" does in English. That effect is to focus on why someone has remembered instead of what they have remembered. 

I hope that helps."
