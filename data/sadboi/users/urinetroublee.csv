These mass spree killings seem to be mostly younger people with the odd exception of some older people. It's just a theory though, obviously some people are just psychopathic, or insane from birth but I think we may be surprised if we looked more into this how much of it could have been prevented.

I literally have to force myself to move forward against all of my instincts, which anxiety have hijacked  and my instincts tell me not to, but they're wrong. 

It's just an awful war that I intend to win. 

I'm done with alcohol. I won't say forever because that seems like a huge thing and unnecessary, but until I get my anxiety worked out, I'm done with it. 

I ordered some Ashwagandha supplement from Amazon, I'll try this out. I am serious about this.

As far as withdrawal, I don't have it too bad, i feel shit for a few days then i'm regular again. I've slowed way down drinking (one single beer every few days) and eventually I'll stop but after relying on it for so long, I feel sort of out there and vulnerable and just full of anxiety.

 I can't cope day-to-day really. I live a stressful life where I have things I have to do and obligations and the anxiety makes it extremely hard. I'm looking to use a supplement that can make me feel normal so I can begin the process and think in a clear way. Make decisions that will benefit me, instead of the fear controlling my decision making (which lead me to drink in the first place) 

I need to reset the system. But I can't think clearly as it is. I have also been to a therapist but again, I feel that's a long process and I need to get myself right first before I forego all that.

I would say it's the fans causing this and it is to a large extent but the world, the music world, seems to be enthralled by the band and find them very interesting and people seem genuinely curious about them. it's great how theyve maintained this for their entire career somehow.  very rare thing, imo.  especially in modern times. i can't even name another band in modern times that has this  same effect."

And then the  part in the middle where it slows down and sounds marching and those creepy strings are playing, it sounds like a large group of soldiers marching through a town. Those drums just thudding away is chilling in a way, it gets so quiet. again, the drumming can't be praised enough, there's this tension in his playing, he's beating the shit out of the drums in the more intense parts, too.

&#x200B;

But yeah the slow part always gets to me, it really sounds like soldiers marching through a town and people looking on in fear and anxiety from their house windows. really tense parts. also i wonder how they got the string parts to sound like they did, they're distorted and grimy and antiquated sounding, almost like something you'd hear in an old time movie from the 30's or 40's .

then the buildup of guitars towards the back half of the song sound so fucking sad. it's like one of the louder parts but the saddest part.  sounds like they use a flanger on the guitar in the later parts. it sounds like it's cycling.

&#x200B;

One of the things you learn with this band when you first start playing their stuff on guitar is that they are masters of effects and knowing when to play, when not to play, and they have very original techniques probably developed over the years. it's very much that they are masters of knowing which effect to use to communicate feeling. they are geniuses at this and it's probably their best quality and what makes them so effective and potent sounding as a band."

beermoney,eq7txl1,t1_eq7sq4d,1559853171.0," i started on rev.com and other transcription sites and i'm making money now with no catch, if i put in the work, i get paid. usually if you work really hard and learn the system, you can make at least 200 dollars a week from these transcription sites. there's no disqualification unless you are lazy and do a bad job.

being verified on paypal is a necessity on most sites though. you have to be or they can't pay you you can't receive money if you're not verified."
beermoney,eq7du7c,t1_eq78ncn,1559845072.0,"I don't think it's good to bash and yell at the survey sites because they only host the surveys, better to email the actual survey companies. it's unfair to bash the sites. unless point club isn't a site, sounds like one though. it's good to keep in mind who you're yelling at when online. like you may be cursing out just some person who manages a part of the site but has no control over the surveys being dishonest."
astrology,eq73d0f,t1_ef3ugzp,1559839825.0,"I wish I hadn't looked into this somewhat now, I have anxiety in general and I'm worried Saturn will be heartless towards this. I've heard this is the case, that Saturn is heartless with how you feel. I haven't gotten any ''help'' for anxiety (saturn in the 7th, all the anxiety is people based) and I don't know what is going to happen. I've worked for years and been disciplined, I have no issue with doing it but sometimes anxiety makes things to where I make bad decisions out of just being totally not myself.  I don't know, kind of worried about it now."
astrology,eq72qaw,t1_ef3wiho,1559839527.0,"I'm curious how this would play out, what saturn return would be like for someone who had people around them and in their life who shouldn't be there, like detrimental people in general. Time to ditch them with the return or is that not a saturn thing?"

beermoney,eq6rmzi,t1_eq6pdyp,1559834247.0,tried every variation. I use a VOP (I think that's what its called) number and they dont accept them. I literally have to buy a phone to use the site.
beermoney,eq6m3hs,t1_eq6hne0,1559831559.0,"Well when I joined MTURK it had little available as far as surveys. Maybe one every week or so. A lot of unavailable jobs and penny jobs. I am always told I'm wrong and people say they make money on it but I didn't understand how, and I still don't.  

I've read guides about it but it basically said do 1000 penny jobs to eventually make money and I was like eh no thanks."

Enneagram,epno0ot,t1_epniv0e,1559330477.0,"He's definitely intense though, sometimes he'll just stare at people for a bit in  other interviews I've seen, and silence doesn't bother him much and he has like no anxiety whatsoever and is calm all the time. it's interesting, his demeanor."
Enneagram,epnnry1,t1_epnidrc,1559330369.0,"Well I was maybe thinking that too. although his reputation is perhaps a bit overblown, apparently some guy tried to provoke him years back and he tied the guy up and tortured him and tried to ''teach him a lesson'' and he kind of scares a lot of people but he does seem nice as long as you don't bother him."
infp,epiorl0,t1_epinl0d,1559241599.0,well lucky you guys but I ended up hanging with people who wanted me to be like that 24/7 and were seriously confused with me shifting into introvert mode.
AskReddit,epinq1g,t1_epin3ax,1559241283.0,you know whats fucked up I originally had it as that but my spellchecker said it was wrong so I changed it.
AskReddit,epim23x,t1_epikxg0,1559240778.0,well what's interesting is that some people immediately understand they're interacting with another human being and act accordingly but it's like some people never have that thought or concern. It's interesting psychologically to wonder why this is the case for some people but not others

Enneagram,epihlny,t1_epigms5,1559239330.0,"A lot of adult bullying is people subtly trying to manipulate you or use power plays on you, usually in office settings or whatever. If you aren't intuitive about that stuff you can actually end up in really bad situations. It builds up over time. Slowly being worn down but since it isn't in an obvious way (like in High School) the person gets away with the behavior for long stretches and you can't really report them or anything because it's  your opinion.  You can easily be labeled as paranoid also. Anyway, I'm rambling and speaking from personal experience but adult bullying absolutely does happen."
AskReddit,epicuzm,t1_epico0t,1559237335.0,"maybe but can they really look at themselves, even after doing awful things, and see a great person? If so, how did they end up so deluded?"
