And yes, I’m school they’re separated by performance but the different types of education are so far apart people in the lower categories, no matter how much work they put in, often cannot make it to the highest. Yes, people will drop if they don’t, but intelligence does play a very large role. IQ mostly measures how quick you learn, which is needed to be able to put up with all the work you’d get. In our schooling system you should work on school for 2 hours every day at home, but people that work hard and are less intelligent often put in 5. I barely do anything, yet have higher results than a lot of people. I’m not delusional, I know if I don’t pick up work ethic I will drastically fail in life, but I definitely know I have high intelligence and usually try to improve in ways I’m behind. 

And let’s be fair, if you work in lots of jobs that include research high intelligence is a HUGE plus to being effective, and people that have a high IQ can often do the same work in a shorter time span. This doesn’t mean people with average intelligence can’t accomplish the same, but high IQ makes it easier."

Mentally disabled people are also not uncommon, though that might be because of my environment (my brother is extremely autistic and doesn’t love at home anymore and I have high functioning Aspergers) meaning I am more exposed to these people. Though, with education splitting the more intelligent people from the less intelligent (I live in the Netherlands and most people fall in the lower categories of education) you’d expect my classmates to learn just as fast.

And if that means you gotta cut ties with her that’s probably for the best! Like honestly, as someone with BPD I can really emphasize how toxic we can be! This isn’t healthy for you or her, and sometimes a rude awakening is the only option. Good luck to you and your mom <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,flmyk2b,t3_fpu020,1585302100.0,"Damn I relate to this. I either get obsessed with someone or I’m a stone wall. There’s no in between. I have been trying to open up more to people by telling them about things in my life without putting in the emotion, but I still feel like that’s worthless."
BorderlinePDisorder,flmy8qs,t3_fpr85j,1585301725.0,"If there’s ever anything you feel like you need to talk about you can message me, I’ll be there for anyone as long as I’m awake at least. I can relate a lot, sometimes things are actually hopeless. It’s difficult to cope with therapy and that’s different for everyone of course. Just know you’re not in this alone, we all know what it’s like here <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,flmy1v4,t3_fprizp,1585301492.0,"I relate to what you’re saying a lot, I’ve gotten my diagnosis a couple of months ago. I think it’s very possible you have BPD but it could always be another disorder that’s similar, so to know that for sure you really should see a therapist. I understand you might not want to do that right now though, so when you’re feeling bad you can always dm me and I’ll be there. We’re all in this together, we just have to support each other no matter what. BPD or not, if you don’t feel like you’re the person you want to or should be that’s always a reason to look for help <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,flkqa2f,t3_fpcvoc,1585245667.0,"Let’s begin by stating we all feel like this, this is just BPD in a nutshell. That said though, it’s not fair to beat yourself up over that. Trial and error are part of trying to learn how to cope, and failures are ALWAYS a byproduct of trying to change behavior. Behavior simply can’t change without a lot of effort. Stay strong, you deserve to feel better with all the effort you put in <3"
AskReddit,flg8x2f,t3_foohpc,1585135329.0,One of my best friends had her granddad pass and now her entire family is infected. Now she can’t even bury him. Also the fact I don’t get to see my handicapped brother for months.
BorderlinePDisorder,flg8v7k,t1_flg8r8x,1585135273.0,"I get that though, when you’re emotional you let your emotions get the best of you sometimes. Next time try planning what you’re gonna say in advance, but for now just try not to isolate yourself completely! It sucks, but call people so you won’t get as lonely. Cuz honestly, that’s what’s getting me through this."

BorderlinePDisorder,flg6wpk,t3_fonbvp,1585133107.0,"Try communicating that you feel that way in a polite manner if you feel that is appropriate in your relationship. From his part it is not “leaving you to fend for yourself” but simply more efficient to be home. Stay strong in isolation, it’s gonna be tough but we all have to do it! <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,flde4ci,t3_fnw83r,1585062660.0,"I feel like I am caving at the lack of social interaction with my friends. I always complain about school and social situations but I feel soo lonely, and just lock myself in my room and get high. Safe to say I’m not doing well, I can’t see my therapist cuz of Corona and I feel genuinely depressed like 90% of the time."
BorderlinePDisorder,flddfd2,t3_fo4gpx,1585062234.0,"I don’t know honestly, I set very high standards for myself. I’m extremely smart and because I have a lot of interest in children and psychology so I’d love to study pedagogy with maybe a psychology major? I’d love to live near the countryside and have three kids. But other than that it’s all blank. I have a long distance relationship (2 years now) with a man I think I’ll marry, but I don’t know if I will move there or he’ll move here. It’s things like this that I get most stressed out about in life as I hate not being sure about the future. Plus, I have so many double feelings on topics like this. For me the big lines aren’t the problem, more so small details as they really stress me out. That I’m a perfectionist though will ruin me, as I’m super close to a burn-out and can’t see my psychologist now due to the pandemic. I want too much and pressure myself a lot, making me scared I won’t function in society. >~<"

AskReddit,fkyn675,t3_flbnqy,1584652083.0,"While working at a supermarket my supervisor said to one of my coworkers “can you go to the wall fridge please. *insert coworkers name* could use some help.” Then she asked me “What’s a wall fridge?” LIKE B**** YOU SERIOUS?? Wall-fridge. A fridge on the wall maybe??? (I swear, it sounds a lot dumber in my language as everyone just calls it that)"
BorderlinePDisorder,fkyk1c5,t3_flenke,1584650279.0,"Personally I don’t use medication, it doesn’t work that well or damages you. If you wanna use it I don’t judge, but therapy is always better in my opinion. As for me therapy alone won’t cut it, I smoke weed on a daily basis. It’s legal here so it’s not really that much of a problem. I don’t know if you’ve tried that, but I can recommend it."

BorderlinePDisorder,fkyihuc,t3_flf61r,1584649401.0,"Try to build up a strong social network with lots of friends. I know when feeling bad it’s easy to avoid people but lots of friends and family around you can really help! Going out and socializing can be an amazing distraction, and try to talk about it. That’s all the advice I have. You should also try to see your own self worth, even without your partner. For a lot of people I know that’s the most difficult part. Good luck <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,fkyi2gi,t3_fle7mz,1584649159.0,"I have been in a relationship for almost 2 years and it’s going great! He started off being just as obsessed with me as I was with him so no problems there. I think at one point I learned to not go to him for all my problems but to multiple people as I often upset him, and ever since then it’s been a lot more stable! I feel like I am truly gonna marry him"
BorderlinePDisorder,fky5gu8,t3_fkzzq4,1584641842.0,"I know this experience, and even when the chance is there I can never seem to take it. It sucks man"
BorderlinePDisorder,fky2bef,t3_fl75af,1584640030.0,"You can ask to get tested for a personality disorder and explain why. You have lots of personality disorders, ranging from antisocial disorder to narcissistic disorder to avoidance disorder. Bipolar is a lot like borderline apart from that borderline also has dissociating and abandonment issues as symptoms. I don’t know if you have these, but you should find a psychiatrist to try and figure this stuff out. Especially at your age though (I’m about the same age) I would NEVER advise you to be on medication. At our age it can trigger addictions and it will stop your motivation to get better with the help of therapy. I would try (while discussing this with a therapist) to stop your medication while in therapy and to try and find replacing coping mechanisms. I don’t know if my comment was somewhat helpful but I hope it is, as I can relate to what you’re saying a lot. I smoke weed and drink quite a bit, just because I can’t cope with the mood swings I have. Hope you get better soon <3"
BorderlinePDisorder,fky1hee,t1_fky16n9,1584639561.0,"I hope you’ll find the answers you’re looking for. I’m not on any meds currently and tbh it feels better than when I am on them. I am starting DBT soon because I show extreme risk behavior, which is also a big difference. DBT is used instead of CBT when the patient shows extreme suicidal and self destructive behavior, and therefor can’t cope with CBT strategies alone."
BorderlinePDisorder,fky0ysj,t3_fldvda,1584639269.0,"DBT is a lot more intense and takes a lot more time and effort, while for most people CBT is more helpful. I would, without a doubt, try CBT first. If it doesn’t work DBT is always still an option."
