Journaling,fleek05,t3_fnvpk6,1585082875.0,"Welcome, and awesome beard! My favorite part of journaling is how much it has helped my mental health. i spent most of my life bottling up emotions, often times without realizing it, and journaling gives me a creative and healthy outlet for the big emotions i feel like i cant handle."

piercing,etswfm5,t1_etsvouf,1563157437.0,"I would just spray it on and gently dry it off with a paper towel. You would know if youre predisposed to keloids already. Its just extra tissue that forms around a scar, i think. Some one correct me if i have that wrong."
piercing,etsvcco,t1_etsv499,1563156563.0,"First of all never use tea tree oil on any piercing whatsoever. Second, those arent keloids unless you are predisposed to them, theyre just irritation bumps. Try uaing wound wash (can pick up frlm any drugstore),  or LITHA. The irritation bumps probably havnt gone away yet because you are irritating them further with the tee tree oil. Happy healing!"
