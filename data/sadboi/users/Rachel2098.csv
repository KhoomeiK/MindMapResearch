Ayahuasca,fqgvpkt,t1_fqgc5ji,1589358765.0,"Ayahuasca is a local name of the vine, banisteriopsis caapi.
When the most people think of ayahuasca, they think of a powerful psychedelic.
However, ayahuasca is the name of the vine which is the maoi component of the brew. People in the community refer to that as ""vine only."" The highly psychedelic component is DMT. Regular doses of vine only have a very very slight psychedelic feel, but is not apparent with daily use.

I use 15 grams every morning. It messes with hormone levels so if you take it long term expect high testosterone (bad acne!) which can be lowered with spearmint, and low progesterone (bad sleep, nervous !) which can be fixed with progesterone cream. :)"

Peptides,fq9iwbt,t1_f7mu3p9,1589199577.0,"Interesting. I believe you but I'm curious how you calculated or estimated the percentage of peptides sourced from china. That's also been my guess so I researched but still can't confirm.

Do you have any trusted chinese sources? Alibaba is full of sellers impersonating legit manufactures. I just reached out to some of the manufactures outside the alibaba platform but haven't heard back yet. I'm guessing they are not on alibaba and don't sell in small quantities to individuals.

Another thing people don't realize is that these peptides from resellers in alibaba are most likely not sterile as they may receive them in big batches and then fill up vials without sterilization. They will need to be sterilized at home via filtration with a syringe filter. I'm scared for the people who don't understand this."

I'm considering ordering mots-c from alibaba. I'm still searching for a company though. Lots of sellers are inpersonating legit manufacturers and that is discouraging. There are many sellers with excellent reviews, though I don't trust reviewers to always know what they are talking about. I do think mostly they are selling real peptides but
I'm concerned with two things

1) I don't know what kind of impurities make their way into peptides during the manufacturing process. Some impurities are harmless. Heavy metals are not. This information is obtainable so I will start researching.

2) I'm terrified they would give me the wrong peptide and I'd take way too much and end up dead. 

Incase you didn't know for future use, you can filter your peptides with a syringe filter to sterilize them so please do if you decided to use then again.

Have you tried anything else from alibaba?"
Peptides,fq9dygw,t3_eyouj4,1589195092.0,"Mc-biotech (Shanghai) Ltd. has a photo of that same building with an airbrushed sign. I actually just emailed the real company asking if they had a page on alibaba. Now I don't have to wait for a reply. That's so frustrating. They have excellent reviews and none are obviously fake, so their stuff might be real.

My guess is that they do supply real peptides, however I'm very leery because they are so dishonest. I don't know what kind of impurities make their way into manufactured peptides. That's what scares me the most. For some substances you can do a Google search for common impurities and the quantities found in that particular substance. So far I haven't found much on what junk could be in peptides.


It would be nice to organize a group purchase and have them tested. That way everyone curious could be satisfied without paying too much.  however there is still the issue of the purity of future batches.

Also, if you can find a verified seller ( they'll have a little blue check mark next to their name) then you know you aren't dealing with impersonators.

hearing,fq5jo6l,t3_ggu4lt,1589107972.0,"I recommend a niacin flush. If your ears are ringing, they were damaged but that doesn't necessarily mean permanent damage . However there is a small window of time for healing to occur in the inner ears after an injury and I recommend you utilize it. When our inner ears are damaged, blood flow is immediately restricted. This unfortunately is not in our favor. A niacin flush will greatly improve blood flow in your ears at this critical time. Fda has approved hyperbaric oxygen chambers for the purpose of increasing blood flow to ears after sudden hearing loss for this exact reason, but I doubt it's as effictive as niacin. You'll understand if you decide to try it because it's very intense. You will turn lobster red for about 20 minutes to two hours from all the dilated capillaries! There is also a not-too-unpleasant burning sensation that accompanies it. It's nothing to worry about.

Take anywhere from 500 -1000 mg of regular niacin. not the ""no flush"" formulas. Those will not work for this situation. They sell the appropriate kind at vitamin shoppe in usa and it's not expensive. I use it frequently to improve blood flow to my ears as I find it reliving for my tinnitus.

Good luck! I hope they stop ringing soon. If you don't decide to take niacin or can't find it, I would at least lay on a heating pad."

MAOIs,fq3prxi,t1_fq2vxnr,1589068833.0,"Omg finally! I was getting so upset listening to this suicide talk and no one even acknowledged the part of my post regarding caapi, just that they already tried moclobemide. I know it hadn't been that long since I posted but I just felt it was going to be completely ignored when it could have saved a life. Thank you.

Caapi is the maoi component of ayahuasca- the very popular psychedelic Amazonian brew. DMT is the psychedelic component. Many people just go for the combine drink, but tranditionally, just the maoi component, caapi is used extensively before the addition of dmt. Caapi is considered the Healing component. it comes from the wood of the Caapi banisteriopsis vine.
I know of several others who use caapi extensively and claim that moclobemide is doesnt hold a candle to caapi. Caapi has a very loving feel to it and they say moclobemide completely lacks that.
I decided to try moclobemide regardless because I don't think it's good to use one substance everyday for too long and I've been using caapi for more than six months now.

Caapi has only had one bad side effect for me so far. It  raised my testosterone to the point of having acne (which I lowered with daily spearmint 
Essential oil or tea) and it lowered my progesterone which can cause nervousness and poor sleep. I use progesterone cream nightly and that fixed that problem. All other hormone levels seem OK. It Just thought Id mention that because it might help someone who decides to give daily caapi a go and ends up with acne, nervousness, pms or poor sleep. It took me a while to figure out what was going on and then found the perfect solutions. 

Also, it's super important to take in the morning because it gives a nice boost of energy. It will interfere with your circadian rhythm if not taken first thing upon waking. 

I want to write more on it but can't now. Just know it's a really really special substance. I hope more people try it."

Ayahuasca,fmnp7qj,t3_ff307u,1586231532.0,"I'm sure you've already figured it out, but just mix it in some warm water! 

To figure out the dose, first multiple the weight of the paste in grams by its concentration. Example: For 75 grams of 30x paste, multiply 75*30. Now you know that 75 grams of paste = 2250 grams whole caapi.

Next, measure the total volume of liquid you have after mixing the paste with water (I like to measue in mL)

Now you have the concentration in grams / mL. 
For example 2250 g/ 100 mL would equal 22.5 g / mL

This is exactly the amount I take every day for PTSD. Not many people use Aya daily but I highly recommend it for ptsd. I started with about 5 grams and slowly tritated up.

So far it's worked very well for me. All of my ptsd melted away, but recently had a relapse into severe depression and grief from everything I lost. When I was feeling better, I failed to put in the inner work needed to move forward and get out of my bad environment. 
Once you start feeling better, get to work.

Also if you do is this daily, please tritate off slowly when you feel it's time to quit. I have no idea if it's safe to take everyday but its safer than having ptsd. Going to do a blood test to check liver and kidney...

You definitely should keep your boundaries, I'm sorry that means that you won't be able to see your sister very much.

 I had been so desperate for mdma therapy to become available  (2021) and I very luckily discovered an effective treatment before dying waiting. It is possible to have mdma therapy on the DL, but I wasn't capable of putting in the footwork at the time.

And I too previously found temporary relief from opiates. It's a very very dangerous road... Please please don't go that direction.
With ayahuasca i have felt no need to abuse anything. It's pretty amazing. I hope you do give it a try."

It's a slow taper but I feel nothing. I also take harmala alkaloids everyday and I think that helps."
MAOIs,ffvnhoh,t1_ffti80w,1580268296.0,"I'm using harmala alkaloids which are MAOIs. Since I have not taken any other MAOI I can't compare but I will try to do my best to give you an idea of its efficacy. 

I used to have Severe treatment resistant depression, severe PTSD, and constant suicidal feelings but now that's all over. I still feel down and disappointed sometimes because my chronic fatigue limits and isolates me, but the disappointment is manageable now with meditation and positive thinking . 

Positive thinking was not even a possibility before. I would try but the negative thoughts came faster and stronger than I could correct. I was drowning. I was in the depths of despair every waking moment. It sounds dramatic but I literally felt like being burned alive would be about the same level of anguish as what I was feeling. I went three weeks without eating at one point because I was so traumatized and miserable. Every thought I had involved wanting to die, imagining dting, etc... It was my first thought upon waking, my first thought before sleeping and every thought inbetween The only reason I didn't kill myself is due to my religious beliefs in reincarnation. (I will just have same situation or worse in next life if I don't solve the problem it in this life.) 

Then I discovered banisteriopsis caapi and harmala alkaloids and decided to give them a try. 

Now I am fine. I went from that to being fine. I wake up, eat breakfast, do yoga, talk to people, make plans and am getting my life back in order. I'm applying to go back to school and thinking about my future while being at more at peace with my present than ever before.

One thing I can say in comparing harmala alkaloids to traditional MAOIs is that there is less of a chance for dangerous drug interactions because harmalas are reversible MAOIs. There is no two week washout period and if you do end up taking something that is contradicted, it can often resolve on its own because the MAO start to be active again. There are also no dietary restrictions. However, I can't vouch for their safety long term and find it wise to do blood testing every now and then. It also caused me acne which has been resolved by drinking mint tea."
chronicfatigue,ffv9h6n,t3_e59sxc,1580258855.0,"I had terrible mind fog and lethargy  until I started on banisteriopsis caapi everyday.

It increases acytlcholine, histamine, serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. It slighly antagonizes gaba at the benzodiazepine receptor. 

I think the increase in histamine and acytlcholine are the major reason it helps with memory.

Is the only thing that's helped me not forget what I'm doing every two seconds. 

Disclaimer:  the harmala alkaloids in banisteriopsis caapi are MAO inhibitors, so care must be taken when used in combination with other drugs. It should not be used with other serotogenic drugs or supplements as this can cause serotonin syndrome. Also, hypertensive crisis can possibly occur when combined with drugs that  increase dopamine and norepinephrine. It should not be used with dextromethorphan or sumatripan. Unlike other MAOIs it does not have any dietary restrictions."

chronicfatigue,ffuxi5u,t3_eq2hdi,1580251221.0,"So far, the biggest help for me ever has come from banisteriopsis caapi extract. I take around 400 mg of 30x extract. Keep in mind that potencies vary widely as there are no standardized extracts available.

The active compounds are the harmala alkaloids- namely harmaline, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, etc. They all have near identical chemical structures and very similar pharmacology To each other.

They (reversibly) inhibit MAO A, which increases serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine- and any neurotransmitter that is metabolized and broken down by MAO.

They inhibit histamine methytransferase and acytlecholinesterace thus increasing histamine and acytlcholine. 
This will increase wakefulness and improve cognition and brain fog. Histamine has a bad rep, but you will find new drugs coming out for alzheimers and narcolepsy that increase histamine and acytlcholine to increase alertness.
I've really had so much success. I don't have brain fog anymore unless I haven't slept and I have so much more energy. 

Tomorrow I will try adding in a H3 antagonist- conessine, which actually increases histamine and acytlcholine via another mechanism of action. 

Aside from that, good nutrition, strict bedtime and wake-up times, bright light therapy, and exercise have also helped, but not to any extent that harmalas have... I could eat well, exercise, and do everything right and still be completely exhausted, infact putting in all that effort was impossible before starting harmala alkaloids. I'm still tired a lot, but I can do so much more now. 
Also, in the past I, struggled with general pain and achiness everywhere, but night now it's under control. I think minerals and chiropractic helped. The pain also seems less when I have more energy from the harmalas. I've read that harmalas are good for arthritis via COX inhibition so they may be helping in several ways.

Disclaimer: MAOIs have serious drug interactions when combined with substances that increase certain neurotransmitters. Most MAOIs are irreversible, but harmala alkaloids are reversible and that makes them so much safer, in that regard, than classic MAOIs.

Also take first thing in the morning or you may not be able to sleep. When I first started using it, I slept kind of lightly, but now I feel my sleep has normalized after a two months.

Don't use if you plan on getting pregnant."

For good measure, take with citrus flavanoids. The flavanoids in citrus are known to cross the blood brain barrier and can help protect hair cells from damage. When you take them with the niacin, it increases their availability to the inner ear. 

I've tried everything and this always works when I have problems with ear fullness  and tinnitus. 

Niacin is also super cheap. Make sure to get the kind that *doesn't* say ""no flush"" on the bottle. Very important!
If you use it frequently you have to increase the dose. Start with 250 mg.  I ended up having to take 1.5 grams to get an effect after some time. Always take on an empty stomach or if won't work. I also take the citrus flavanoids 15 minutes before the niacin because the niacin will begin to work very quickly- possibly before the flavanoids enter the blood stream.

Our Neurochemistry is just that- chemistry. Interactions and reactions. Remember balancing equations in chem class?... When you manipulate one side of an equation, you must adjust the other side... Inhibiting or disinhibiting one chemical in our brain will have a cascade effect on others. It's the nature of the universe.  And It obviously isn't separate from our mental experience.. Our chemistry affects our experiences and our experiences and thoughts affect our chemistry.

Say you have a hangover, which in part is due to acute withdrawal (as well as dehydration, poor sleep quality etc) Withdrawal makes you nervous. Feeling nervous can trigger negative thinking, bad memories, depression... Your own negative or positive thoughts will have an effect on your brain chemistry and your current brain chemistry will influence your thoughts!

MAOIs,fax32lp,t3_e8pm2f,1576378220.0,"I've been looking into antagonism of 5-ht2, 3 and 4 to combat the sleep deprivation as well as anorexia and sexual dysfunction inducing side effects due to unselective 5-ht activation of many antidepressants.

Several antidepressants that selectively antagonize 5-ht2 etc, have proven to have less sexual and sleep side effects as well as less appetite suppression. All which I have issues with.

I use herbs over pharmaceuticals since it allows more freedom to play around. 

Substances I have been looking to try:

Stephania root - contains crebanine, a suspected (via mass spectrometry) 5-ht2a and 2c  antagonist. It has been used in Chinese herbal medicine for thousands of years but not specifically for sleep.

Polygala: probably works like a tricyclic antidepressant, With 5-ht2 action https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/13880209.2011.621958

Feverfew: 5-ht2a and 2c antagonist 

Also, chamomile selectively antagonizes 5-ht3 and maybe 4 receptors... It helps immensely with my appetite and some with sleep. 

When I see my doctor in going to ask about mirtazapine.

Surely there are other mechanisms that could be affecting sleep architecture with maois... I use ayahuasca daily and it is a potent inverse agonist of GABA A. That could also be keeping me awake at night so I've also looked into magnolia bark and valerian to counter this if possible.

I'll let you know how my experiment goes. As always be careful with MAOI interactions and start low. 
I bought a blood pressure cuff to help monitor myself while experimenting.

If you're having problems with benzodiazepine withdrawal (which if I remember correctly from previous research, upregulates glutamate through a cascade effect starting with GABA A benzodiazepine action) then maybe you just need something like flumazenil. I don't know if it downregulates glutamate, but it can reverse tolerance and withdrawal after a week of use (on average.)
There are other natural benzo antagonists as well albeit less studied. 
Danshen (Salvia miltioddhiza) contains miltrione, a GABA A antagonist / partial agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site (it blocks the binding of benzos and therefor acts as an antagonist in certain situations). I've seen it mentioned several times as a treatment for alcoholism and benzo addiction. 
Another one, Ayahuasca (Banisteriopsis Caapi) contains harmala alkloids, which are potent inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site and is extremely therapeutic as an MAOI and 5-ht1a agonist etc. I haven't heard mention of its use for benzos withdrawal but it's a very plausible assumption. 
I take 8-40 grams of the vine everyday depending on the (highly variable) potency.  It has treated my ptsd and severe depression very effectively. There are many others I've come across,  but those are the two that came to mind.
