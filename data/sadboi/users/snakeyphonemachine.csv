BorderlinePDisorder,fehfmwz,t3_ep4rii,1579115550.0,"Maybe with these “smaller” issues you aren’t necessarily overreacting but you’re just very sensitive. That would also explain feeling numb when something terrible happens because it’s just too much. You don’t know how to feel because it’s such a tremendous thing happening. I have a similar reaction to things. I cry, a lot. At seemingly tiny things but when I feel something I feel it strongly and I can’t help that. That being said I don’t handle bigger things like death like it seems most other people do. I don’t feel anything. I have no reaction. Just shock. And worry for other people who are actually feeling something. I don’t think this is bad or wrong, just different. We all process things so different and human minds are so complicated and diverse that there is no way to determine a “right” or “wrong” way to experience things. So no, you are not a terrible person. Just a little different than the people around you.

I don’t think you should feel guilty about not contacting your friend more before they passed on. Although I know it is hard not to. It is easy to blame ourselves for our every part in a situation. This is just one way to cope. You were close with them at one time in their life and gave them a happy experience at one point and that is enough to offer someone. That is a gift. Life is short and we lose people we really care about but we cannot be expected to call everyone we know every day just in case they go. If you feel hurt at their absence now it’s because you cared for that person, not because you’re guilty or you weren’t doing enough. I don’t know you but it seems to me that you are a very caring and empathetic person and I think you’re being way too hard on yourself. These expectations you have in your mind for grief are unrealistic and you need to accept yourself the way you are and the way you feel and experience things. You have been through enough hurt, you cannot keep hurting yourself like this. I hope this truth helps. And if you feel like you have no one and you need support, I know you don’t know me, but you can message me. I am a stranger who cares."

I think it’s a bigger favor to just be honest and allow them to have their own experience and learn for themselves. As hard as it may be to watch people you care about be lied to or exposed to toxic people, it’s not our place to learn someone’s lessons for them or fight their battles. 

I avoid meetups that she is attending and express my disinterest in an honest way. I simply have no desire to be around someone like that. I do not allow that energy in my circle. Period.

Things were dark before that, growing up with an alcoholic parent. Long before this we were moving and there was this creepy goblin looking statue that my dad had owned for a long time.

They had a lot of knowledge about the object I wish I could remember exactly but this was like 18 years ago. 

But even that was nothing like this. I was plagued with nightmares and debilitating anxiety and paranoia. I would see disturbing things in my room at night.

BorderlinePDisorder,fd3v119,t3_ejtrvl,1578161860.0,"Tw: sexual abuse, sorry this is long and specific but maybe someone can relate

I was never validated in any sense I feel. I felt like I was not a part of my family. I felt like my mom didn’t care about me because she didn’t save me. 

My bio dad was a drug addict and my mom left him for my step dad who became a raging alcoholic after my half sisters were born. He would beat me and my brother a lot. My brother got it little worse than me but only that he would slam my brother’s head into a corner of a wall until he had a huge purple knot on his forehead. He was in kindergarten. He never did that to me. But he did beat both of us bare-assed with a wooden backscratcher until our butts were bleeding. I’m the oldest so I remember everything even my brother’s screams which still play in my head sometimes but I don’t even know what we did that was so wrong.

When he would come home from work no one was allowed to make any noise or annoy him at all or you were stuck in the room in bed all night until the next day. Sometimes without dinner.

He started sexually abusing me when I was 9 years old and it continued until I was 17. He would only do this to me when I was sleeping. The first couple of times I woke up butt naked. The second time that happened I started crying because I didn’t understand what was happening. He came out of his room obviously drunk asking me what was wrong. I asked him where my clothes were and he brought them to me from his room. I told my mom and she told me that maybe I was sleep walking. 

I didn’t tell her anything else because I felt like she wouldn’t believe me anyway.

I didn’t tell her until the last time it happened I woke up with his hand down my shirt. But I only told her that. I wasn’t ready to tell her everything else. Like when I was 11 and I woke up to him rubbing my back and calling me sexy. I was in fifth grade. I thought sexy was a bad word. 

So she thought that was the extent of it. They had a talk about it and she helped him come to the conclusion that maybe he was so drunk he doesn’t know what he did. But he knows. I know he knows. Because for 8 years after he could not make eye contact with me. (I still lived with him and saw his face every day and still have to. Pretending everything is okay.) She took me to therapy but told me not to tell them anything because they might take my half sisters away. That made me feel like they mattered more than I did. I always felt that they did. I was getting THEIR hand-me-downs. Maybe they did. She never listened to the pain I felt and never allowed me to talk about it. 

I felt like she didn’t care and she made me feel guilty for feeling like she doesn’t care. It hurt. It broke my heart. He hurt me but she broke my heart. I didn’t tell her everything else until I was 23. She just cried and said, “I’m so sorry.” 

And that was it.

I had to heal myself because no one wanted to listen. And that created its own wound in myself."

Mind you, they are not driving very fast at all. There was about 2-3 car lengths between us when I got in front of them. Apparently they did not like that because they sped up those car lengths to tailgate me, switched lanes to try and pass me so I sped up so they couldn’t. So they went back to tailgating me. By now the traffic was heavy enough to where they couldn’t maneuver around me so I drove oh so slowly, just to spite them.

BorderlinePDisorder,fbcv2bg,t3_eckwcj,1576734840.0,"I experience this too. I’ve never understood why or how to break out. It’s like my gut reaction is to just combust whenever I’m triggered. I’ve calmed down a lot from how I used to be but I still have a long way to go. I used to think it was related to my mom telling us kids that she wanted to hang herself every time we were especially hard to deal with because we were “so awful.” But I’ve also been hearing this is relatively common with bpd, so I don’t know.

Edit: tapping into the feeling, I think maybe it comes from of place of feeling like there is no other option. Like you’re backed into this corner and there’s no way out or any way to save or protect yourself. At least for me personally."
