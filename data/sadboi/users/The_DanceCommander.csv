Once you get out passed the 495 beltway though the public transport options start to drop off, and most people drive.

I would probably bet that most people drive up here anyway though because the public transport doesn't have very good in-between lines. Like you can get from Alexandria to DC pretty easily using public transport but if you wanted to go west from Alexandria to Arlington or Tysons then it would be much more complicated than just driving. Once you actually in DC you really don't need to drive much, but yeah as with most cities the further away from the urban core you are they worse your options.

I should note though, driving up here *fucking sucks* yesterday it took me like 40 minutes to drive like 8 miles and that's a normal commute it's absurd.

anime,eu52jun,t3_ceu2ns,1563468522.0,"Iâ€™m still in shock at the scale of this tragedy. 33 people killed, the worse mass murder Japan has experienced in 20 years. I just can't imagine the horror of this, I can't imagine what their families are going through. 

I think Americans have become tragically used to random acts of mass violence, but it's so bizarre to see it happen in another country where this kind of mass murder is unheard of. It's just so terribly sad, so awful. I hope everyone involved in this tragedy are able to recover. 

Itâ€™s just, itâ€™s the worst thing that could have ever possibly happened to some of the most talented and kind people. All KyoAniâ€™s work is so full of joy, even their sad works, they are such a positive influence in everyoneâ€™s lives, I just canâ€™t fathom why they would be attacked like this.

K-On! is the show that really got me in to anime years and years ago, and is still my favorite show after all this time. I really owe this studio a lot when you think about it. I hope everyone there, all the survivors and everyoneâ€™s families will be ok."
