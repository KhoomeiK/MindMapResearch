His designs for Xenoblade Chronicles 2 could easily be mistaken for Dissidia, XIII and XV. Also Final Fantasy IX has a unique art style out of the entire franchise not only because Toshiyuki Itahana hasn't worked on many games in the franchise but even then he did the Crystal Chronicles subseries which has a world similar to IX's Gaia yet looks super different. And if you are getting characters from IX mixed up with VII and VIII I don't know what to say.

Looking at the Vita,Wii U,Saturn and Dreamcast I've learned that 3rd party video game developers love nothing more than a self fulfilling prophecy. We have all these games that are digital only only Switch that could have been on Wii U. Some of the same devs who said they didn't know how to implement the second screen were literally making 3DS games at the same time. I bet Kojima giving that excuse only for MGSV to have a second screen companion app is the reason Snake got cut in Smash 4.
