Quite an extreme case so it's worth looking into surgery. Not just for aesthetic reasons but for health. You may be able to get it covered by insurance as a result.

I can sort of relate to what you are saying. I've had a few moments in the library or on the bus where I wished I could give a shoulder massage to the person next to me because I could feel their tense energy crawling up my arm. This wasn't necessarily an altruistic impulse, in the same way that your siding with your friends may be more to serve your own discomfort at their feelings than it is to serve them.

dating_advice,fpb4arr,t3_gc5ar8,1588461812.0,"I'm sure everyone else already addressed the mental and communication issues, so I'd mostly like to address the physical ones if you find that helpful.

First off. Most guys don't care if you're a virgin and some of them actually prefer it due to weird sexist ideas. You say in your post that men will be put off like it's a matter-of-fact thing, but is this really true? Trust in the person to respond graciously. I have told several guys my issues with PIV sex (which I won't get into here) and they responded with eagerness to have other forms of sex with me even in a long-term partnership. Guys love every kind of sex. They might need time to process, so don't take rejection as final.

Now for the physical stuff. My fingers don't do it for me either, sis. I need pelvic floor stimulation to orgasm, and this comes from wrapping my legs tightly around something or having something besides my fingers in me. It sounds from your post like you have not tried much beyond fingers. See what works for you - it's worth investing in some good toys so you can experiment alone. If you feel pain upon insertion, I recommend buying a vaginal dilator set to stretch you out gently at a comfortable speed. Even if you decide insertive sex just isn't for you, you'll find dilation to be quite a relaxing form of self-care. It's like yoga for your cooch. I recommend pelvic floor exercises too to keep your bits happy and healthy, especially if you have less pelvic floor stimulation from lack of PIV. You'll be less likely to get incontinence and prolapse when you're older if you keep it toned. Sorry that's so off-topic but it's worth mentioning in the subject of self-care. :)

Also, have you considered the possibility of being asexual? It's okay to question, and if you never want to have sex, that's perfectly valid."

Thankfully if you're able to fix crooked teeth this way, you will not need a retainer to keep them straight.

Keep following the tropic premise, doing research on orthotropics, and bettering your posture at night. You may want to research appliances and treatment that can help expand your upper and lower jaw.

I stopped wearing my retainer two months ago and my teeth are still perfectly straight so I do think it's quite possible to keep them straight if you oral posture diligently. I am looking into an expansion appliance to undo the harm done by my orthodontic treatment and years of poor posture."

myopia,fp0uv8g,t1_fp069dt,1588217446.0,">[Myopia] is due to the fact that the Corneas are shaped incorrectly to let light into the Optic Nerve via the Retina.

Half-true. Myopia is caused by accommodation of the eye without release. The standard accepted belief is that accommodation is caused by the ciliary muscle. Dr. William Bates's studies found that accommodation, and subsequently myopia, are caused by flexion of the exterior muscles, and subjectly alters the shape of the entire eyeball. The corneas is affected as a byproduct of this.


>The Corneas needs to be re-shaped to change how light enters the Retina. That's the only way to 'cure' Myopia.

The corneas can be reshaped to correct errors of refraction but it doesn't correct the underlying issues in function and form of the eyes. There are natural ways of changing the function such as the Bates Method."
