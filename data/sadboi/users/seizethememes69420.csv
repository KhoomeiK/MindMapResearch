Honestly, the fact that you are a porn creator is pretty irrelevant. If he were messaging/talking to the creators that would be one thing but it seems like he is just paying for porn. The fact that you are a porn creator as well really just makes it baffling to me more than anything. You, of all people should understand that there is nothing going on here except an exchange of services.

Also, stop sharing your profits with him. Either he is cool with it or he isn't, you shouldn't be bribing him to accept your side gig as legitimate labor."
