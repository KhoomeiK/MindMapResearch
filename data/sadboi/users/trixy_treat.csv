I was with a guy for about 2 months, 5 years ago, after we broke up he stole a key to my house and refused to give it back, for ages afterwards, until I managed to get the lock changed, he was coming into my house when I was out and moving things around, leaving the front and back door open, taking things and I think he was hiding in my attic for a while!! 

He still tries to contact me, even 5 years later, I get nasty messages every Xmas from his and every now and then he'll message someone off my friends list about me :/


Hope your crazy leaves you alone after this x"

To listen to people, not wait your turn to talk (there is a massive difference)

Being told 'dont be silly' isn't helpful when you're depressed
