schizoaffective,f6rmflt,t3_dspqye,1573109902.0,"Returning to school is great when you advanced in your coping strategies! I was 29 when I finished my Specialist program (equals Masters in other countries). It was horrible, because I was not diagnosed, was not properly medicated and had only a therapist who was in denial about my shizo stuff. I even had to take a year break for finishing my thesis. I often missed classes and had a hard time even leaving home. 

Now I'm 34 and I returned to university to finish my PhD thesis. Now I'm medicated, have a great therapist and psychiatrist. I know I'm old for being in PhD studies, but I'm in best condition! And I hope I'll finish my thesis.

What I want to say: I believe proper medication, therapy and supportive psychiatrist are the key components for graduation."

I'm currently on Aripiprazole(Abilify), really small dosage and Escitalopram, it's an antidepressant. Me with my psychiatrist have decided to wait on the small dosage to see how I will react, before cancelling it altogether. So far I'm in psychodynamic therapy and it works great for me. I really hope I will be free of meds by new year."

But he's also a psychiatrist with a huge experience, so I think it helps him to understand me. And I saw  Spotnitz on his bookshelves in the office.

I've read  Spotnitz myself and I think he has interesting ideas. I can recommend a book of his student "" The Hate That Cures: The Psychological Reversibility of Schizophrenia "" by  Evelyn Liegner. I think my analyst uses her ideas in his work with me.
