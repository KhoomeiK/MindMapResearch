I've loved the song ever since I heard it on the radio about 13 years ago. I'm one of them people that can love a song and not listen to the lyrics for years. It's weird, I don't really like songs without lyrics, but songs with lyrics, I enjoy for the music. Only exception is Brian Eno - An Ending.

For the actual song, I realised what the lyrics of the song were about a year after hearing it after a bad break up and on a drinking binge. It doesn't remind me of the break up, it's just the lyrics resonate with me, because i feel like I'm not loved and never will be, even though i have people around me that say that they do. But that's my depression for me."

Then they'll set up, over power or under power their shot and end up in a bunker or something.

Watch one guy or girl earlier, fire their 1st shot in the water. Do you think they adjusted and learnt from the 1st shot? Nope, did exactly the same thing.

I also see a lot of people setting up a shot for the green, getting it perfectly lined up for the hole, then under power it. Why?"

However, since I found out I had cancer in February, because of course more things could go wrong when I was starting to get better at shit, I've lost the ability to cry. I nearly fainted when I was told the news, but I haven't cried since. I need to cry but it cant be forced... I hate my life"
GolfClash,fp18uk0,t3_gapau4,1588227757.0,"I played about 2 or 3 years ago, not sure how old this game is, but it was on my old phone and after I got to tour 6 or 7, my phone started playing up, I think I warped the battery so stopped playing games. I got a new phone in January and remembered this game about 9 days ago or so. Before jumping back in, I decided to research what people think is the best way to go. The most common is, gold management, only move up when you 10 or 20x the buy in. Others have said, get the decent clubs from each tour to level 3 or 4 before moving up.

I've stayed in Tour 2, I've played about 400 games so far, still haven't fully figured out a couple of the holes, but I'm getting there. Anyway, I have an 85% win rate. I thought because of my previous experience, I was getting an advantage, but it's amazing how many people I have played lately with a win rate the same or higher than mine. It's also amazing that i beat these guys and the few losses I get are to people with around 35% win rate"

But this is the issue with mental illness I think.
