depression,f26h291,t3_dc7pyg,1570009899.0,"Hey, I've been in your position before. I decided to leave as soon as possible (they let me, because I was having breakdowns in the office) and I think at this point it'd be healthier for you to leave as soon as you can, as well. Let your employer worry about what happens when you leave, because it might take too long for them to find a replacement that it'll just aggravate your current condition.

Best of luck to you, and I hope things will get better for you!"
NintendoSwitch,f1zboh3,t1_f1zb8fa,1569840873.0,"If that's the case, I personally don't see the sense in getting two switches. Consoles are expensive and life isn't cheap. But yeah, I suppose there will always be someone who'll buy as many as they can regardless of how useful a new unit will be."
NintendoSwitch,f1zb4iq,t3_db9knm,1569840483.0,"If it has a different purpose other than the exclusive use of one owner, I wouldn't say it's dumb. Like you said, it'd be good for kids, so if I were to hypothetically buy two switches, one would be for me, the other would be for a sibling or a child. If both regular and lite switch are for you and you only, however, I do see that that's superfluous. Then again, there will always be someone who'll buy everything for collection purposes. 

I own the lite and it's my first switch. I definitely intended to get it as a replacement for my 3DS, and as I have budget constraints that make it a bit hard to put on more for a full-sized switch, I'm glad the lite is here. I might consider upgrading once I get a better job, but for now, the lite serves its purpose and I'm just happy I can finally play Fire Emblem: Three Houses."
