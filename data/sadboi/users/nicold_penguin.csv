Crushes,fptvil5,t3_gcovir,1588899103.0,"Hi _______. I don't know what so say, so here it is. I really like you. I don't want this to become some rom-com, sappy love note, but it can't be helped... everyday, my mind is filled with thoughts of you. Everytime I see you, (which is barely ever now that we're in quarantine,) my heart skips a beat. I become a red tomato. I want to talk to you all the time, see you all the time, but I'm super anxious and awkward and don't know anything about flirting or showing hints. I get jealous so easily... it's something I want to stop, but we're not even a thing and I don't want to lose you... your friends and my friends ship us, I've caught you staring, there were many times were it feels like we're honestly kind of a couple... is that a sign? Probably, but of course I'm too self-depreciating to think that's something. I wanted to keep this a bit shorter, but, of course, I love writing and expressing my feelings. You've mentally helped me during school. My friends are toxic and my life sucks. You're literally the light of my life... I try to not get too attached because of reasons... but I've definitely fallen for you. I miss you and I love you. I hope you feel the same..."
