I wonder every day what my life would have been like if I did say no or if I had resisted or if I had told someone.

I can think of a lot of times people have said ""I don't like this. Do you want it?"" about food because they legitimately don't like it but don't want to waste it. 

3. Why do you feel so pressured to share your food that you have to make up an elaborate lie? Seems like more effort than it's actually work.

He didn't follow me, but instead he started to scream at my mom about how disrespectful I was. I sat on my bed upstairs as I heard my mom escalate the fight. 30 minutes of screaming about how awful I was and everything awful about me.

My mom wasn't even defending me, she'd just scream back how awful /he/ was. It was some of the worst moments of my life. I have a few of his comments burned into my brain. The entire time, I just sat on my bed, numb.

Felt like a coward. I had nothing left in me at that point, and I was just deflated. Eventually, my mom came upstairs and told me she didn't want me to go to my dad's (who she hates), but I needed to leave the house. As if I couldn't hear that conclusion myself.

I ended up homeless for a short while after that. I don't know why I didn't go to my dad's after that, but I wasn't really thinking straight. I remember having an AP test the next day and being so stressed. I had 4 more the next week.
