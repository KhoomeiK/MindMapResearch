costa_rica,etgrrh8,t3_cbl63x,1562797480.0,"Agreed, Jaco isn’t as bad as it used to be. I haven’t been in a while, but here are a few places I like to eat: 
- the taco bar
- there’s a fish monger on the south (?) end of town in front of the gym with killer ceviche. 
 - the green room
 - there’s also a bakery a few blocks north (?) of the beetle bar that’s very good. It’s called something like panadería artisanal.

North and south are based on thinking the beach is west, I’m not sure how accurate that is."

marketing,eo9l5ws,t3_bqul7z,1558394017.0,"I’d test ads with “no hidden fees” or “avoid additional fees hidden in the fine print” - maybe for the latter provide visitors a free printout to compare prices to help them know what to look for when they’re shopping? I don’t know if people comparison shop for this kind of thing.

you may want to remove your price from the ads completely, and provide information about what funeral homes do to over charge people on your landing pages, where you show your price. That way you have an opportunity to explain why your price is higher."
