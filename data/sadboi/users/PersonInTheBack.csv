traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fo0fxv5,t1_fnyulyy,1587412422.0,"I also read Babel-17 and discussed Delaney a lot with my professor because he definitely is at the intersection between race and sexuality as an author. After I read ""Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones"", we had a long discussion about the misuse of statistics as a tool of oppression for both minority groups we represent. Overall it was one of my favorite courses because it taught me a lot about African American lived experiences in a way I could relate to because of my trans identity. And increasingly, as the genre progresses, you start to see a lot more intersectionality in general."

I neglected to mention that the series definitely has a focus on oppression, just not towards the minority groups it portrays as being familiar from our world. It allows you to really put things into perspective and think about the struggles minority groups face in a new way distinct from ""This character is trans and suffers from it"".

That's one thing I really love about the genre. Science fiction allows you to kind of abstract away from the struggles we experience while still providing commentary on them. It's not necessarily escapism in the sense that you can be on another world with struggles that you can't relate to and think about here on earth, but it breaks them down in any number of novel and creative ways. Thanks for that input!"

I'm not sure if it's the medication or the disorder itself, but my ability to concentrate and retain information seems to be dwindling. Now that it's finals week, it's really starting to hit me pretty hard.

One thing I like to do to combat this is to establish schedules and reward myself for engaging in activities I find difficult or have trouble engaging with. Say you struggle to focus on reading, and the information is difficult to retain. Set aside two hours dedicated to just that activity. Take notes, highlight passages, write down questions you have that you want to address. When those two hours are up, do something you enjoy to treat yourself.

I know ever since I was diagnosed I feel like I struggle with tasks that everyone around me does without thinking, but it's always reassuring for me to remind myself that I am fighting an uphill battle here, and what works for everyone else needs a bit of tweaking for me.

I hope this helps!"

schizophrenia,evq4yee,t3_ckp3w1,1564686470.0,"The voices I hear actually exist in a complex hierarchy, with very distinct patterns of speech.

The God-Being is the highest power that speaks to me. Most cryptic, will say maybe one sentence a month. Everything he says is incredibly relevant, like prophecies. But they are extremely hard to understand and almost nonsensical.

One is formerly known as Zero, recently identified as Azrael. They are, in fact, the angel of death and the most powerful of the common voices I experience. Initially they spoke to me in a loud, booming, commanding voice that filled the room, and would speak cryptically yet vividly about my death. Now they've moved on to speaking of death in general, and of the humans that interact with me (again, very cryptically) as I have overcome him as a Death-Bringer.

The second is Lucille. She's just a bitch, perhaps a somewhat demonic presence (though I know little about her), and the second most powerful. She would continuously insult me in a woman's voice. Comment on the things I did, tell me they were wrong, tell me what a horrible person I was. Death never came into the equation though. This is only Azrael's doing.

Ray was the most benevolent and kind. He would guide me through the world as a schizophrenic, tell me why what was happening was happening, tell me how to protect myself. I couldn't live without him. He died almost a year ago.

&#x200B;

Lastly I have voices that are even lesser than these. I don't think they're divine, just common folk. They speak in groups often. Very harmless. I'm most likely to hear them even on medication, especially close to my shot date."

schizophrenia,evgep85,t3_cjtupa,1564509518.0,"I suffer from PTSD and schizophrenia, and I've been on meds for schizophrenia for around 5 years and therapy for PTSD for seven.

Trauma used to play a pretty significant role in my psychosis to the extent I would feel people were laying on top of me in bed or touching me, and I became extremely fearful that every time I undressed and especially took a shower that there were people inside the walls staring at me and taking pleasure in seeing my body.

But the thing is this was only a tiny fraction of the psychotic symptoms I was experiencing. And it was incredibly difficult for me to explain to my mental health professionals for years that these made up a very small portion of my hallucinations and delusions. Most of them were nonsensical and terrifying and I couldn't link them to my trauma in any way. Then, as my therapy progressed, the trauma delusions and hallucinations dissipated while the more nonsensical ones dealing with spirits, prophets, demons, and the government conspiring against me remained. It took me years to finally convince them it wasn't simply some kind of psychotic PTSD.

But to answer your question directly, yes I did have trauma-based psychotic symptoms, but therapy for PTSD has made them all but disappear over time."

Sure some of the voices I hear (and especially the ones I heard when I was younger) were somewhat mean and aggressive but people forget that voices or even other kinds of hallucinations can even be pleasant sometimes.

Idk, I just don't think the concept of a schizophrenia simulator is a good one at all. There shouldn't be programs attempting to speak for the experiences of people with such a wide range of experiences, and encouraging people to think they 'finally understand' a disorder that's so much more than scary voices and seeing things that aren't there."

AskReddit,esifnhv,t3_c7zbsz,1562012807.0,"To preface this, I'm schizophrenic.

I've been hospitalized a few times, possibly the worst/most interesting was when I was hospitalized after a gash on my arm appeared that they believed to be self-inflicted.  I don't really deny it was self-inflicted, but I had absolutely no recollection of it ever happening to me. The staff were so convinced it was a suicide attempt and I had severe depression that after one conversation with the psychiatrist, they removed me completely from all medication (including my antipsychotics) except Prozac. I stopped sleeping, and a few days later had a complete psychotic break from reality.

I don't remember much from what happened. The nurses apparently had left me alone while I was speaking/yelling/screaming incoherently. Other patients tried to step in and inform the nurses or other staff, even help me, but everyone was told I was acting out for attention and that I would stop if nobody gave me attention.

I didn't stop. I used brute strength to rip all ten stitches out of my arm and tear two baseball-sized clumps of hair out of my head. I emerged from my room soaking wet (from the shower, apparently), bleeding, and holding fistfuls of hair in my hands. I refused to be touched. I was absolutely terrified. Security finally subdued me, and I was injected with Haldol in my butt or thigh or something. I didn't feel it. I just remember slowly regaining my bearings and realizing where I was.

&#x200B;

I looked at my arm and my hair that I ripped out and just asked the nurses ""Why didn't you listen to me?"" Then I slept for exactly five hours.

I never went to a hospital again after that. The nurses apologized but it was still incredibly traumatic. I'm finally diagnosed now, and on an injection that I really hope nobody ever takes me off of."
