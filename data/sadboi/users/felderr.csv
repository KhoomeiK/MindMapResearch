I feel the same way, my memory and concentration wasn't great to begin with but things just got worse. My brain dogs get worse by the day.

I used to study to become an Mental Health Nurse. I stopped because as much as I absolutely loved caring for patients, I was always second guessing myself specially when it came to medication administration. I beat myself up for thinking that i was cut for that kind of work. I thought I had enough intelligence to be a MH Nurse, let alone a carer. I feel stupid for thinking I could.

People tell me I should carry on with it. I tell them I will when the time is right but honestly I don't think I will. I'm terrified that my stupidity might cost someone's life.

I absolutely hate the fact that I feel like I should be a nurse, and i want to be one... but my stupidity, memory, and concentration won't allow me to."

I was just about done cooking the meals, welcoming everyone after the clock struck 12, I was just about done. I had to stay in my room and just take a breather, had to tell everyone who knocked I was with family on the phone. Eventually stepped out to mingle. But had to excuse myself to sleep later on as I was really not into it at all. It was emotionally overwhelming.  That's when I realized that the statement ""one is at their loneliest not when alone, but when surrounded by people they love but feel empty still"". Coincidentally, this was the time one of my ""friends"" started talking behind my back and therefore ruining a good relationship between me and one of my good friends."
