depression,fo2jjya,t3_g4trq6,1587464846.0,"I had imaginary friends growing up. At my house people would ignore me, because of that I learned to like being alone. I connected with the characters from my books so bad that sometimes I imagined them holding me tight, worrying about me, comforting me. It's normal to try to get some relief when you're feeling that kind of deep pain, there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you're not harming yourself and/or other people it's okay to do anything to feel better."

depression,fns63dz,t3_g3jolb,1587213777.0,"I understand how you feel...I ask myself ""what the fuck is wrong with me? Why won't anyone find me attractive?"" all the time. I think it's a problem of our society as a whole- see how in movies and Instagram posts and books and TV and series and animes and in any type of media, romantic love is seen as the ultimate goal? As the only thing that's gonna make you truly happy? See how people treat old and single people, virgins, as if there's something wrong with us? See how society is built around the idea of the perfect romantic relationship (true love)? 

There's many, *many* reasons why we (and many other people) are not in a relationship. 

1)The same way ur not attracted to everyone, not everyone is attracted to you. Maybe you're just interacting with people that don't see you as their type- but it doesn't mean that no one in 7 billion people think you're not their type. 

2)Maybe you don't go out as much, you're not very prone to socialize and meet new people. 

3)Maybe you're too anxious around strangers, and being someone with social anxiety I know people look at us and sense we're defensive and tend not to talk to us. 

4)Maybe you're self sabotaging yourself.

 But in any way shape or form it means that there's something inheritely wrong with you and that a relationship will make you perfectly happy and will change your life. Happiness is within yourself and I say this from a place of someone who has only dated one guy that was never in love with me. I've been looking for relationships like crazy and never found anyone; when I was with this guy, I was as miserable as I was before meeting him (don't get me wrong, he's a great person and treated me like a queen) because *dating will not make you happy if you don't know how to be slightly happy while single*. 

I'm learning how to overcome this. How to depend solely on myself and not put my happiness in someone's else's shoulders. It's hard as fuck not to doubt yourself when you have a mental illness, specially if untreated or poorly treated, but I strongly believe that staying single for a while (or maybe forever) will be better for me in the long run. 

If you're not treating your mental illness (that I suppose it's depression since you're in this subreddit) I strongly advise you to. I'll link a website that does online counseling for free in the us, Canada, uk and Ireland if you can't afford to pay for therapy. Wish you the best of luck♥️

depression,fns4te2,t3_g3ljni,1587212664.0,"I know how you feel...but reciprocation can come in many many forms, usually not the form you wanted/expected. They might not be chatting a lot with you but maybe they sent you a song and said ""hey, I think you'll like this band"". My sister rarely calls me or initiate a conversation, but I know she loves me bc she always includes me in her life plans, makes me little presents or drawings and asks for advice- same goes for my bff, he rarely says something but whenever I need help or support he's there for me. If the people u are concerned about demonstrate that they care about you in others ways I don't think the fact that they don't check on you means they don't care- but if you're the only one checking and trying to chat and being there for them and they don't do none of this for u, they're not worth your time. There are people out there who would truly treasure your company."
transstoriesgonewild,fns48o3,t3_g3j6k4,1587212148.0,"I'm kinda curious, how old are you?"
ageregression,fns41fa,t3_g3lud2,1587211965.0,"Hey sweetie!
 
I know it can be extremely painful, and I think you guys should discuss this- if there's a way out of this situation, if you can do something and try to fix this. 

If you already had this conversation and you guys think there's nothing you can do to solve the problem, I think in the long run it will be better if you just let go of him. 

It can be hard not to have a caregiver but you definitely do not need one to be a perfectly happy little one. I'm struggling to make myself happy while single, but I know it is the best decision for now as I don't have the mental stability to be in a relationship with a caregiver; honestly I'm having a great time regressing alone and ageregression is teaching me how to be happy by myself. 

You are strong and you'll make through this♥️♥️♥️"
aromantic,fnrnvd6,t1_fnr9sxw,1587195125.0,Yessss I think it's time for us to challenge that way of thinking
aromantic,fnqyhzs,t1_fnqyb8d,1587175037.0,"I think so, also think that's kinda the problem- how we idolize romantic love to the point that if we don't have it on our lives we worry that something might be wrong with our personality"
aromantic,fnje4ep,t3_g1z489,1586997130.0,"I'm still figuring things out but a couple days ago I realized I was looking for someone to date cause I wanted to feel desired, admired. my self esteem is basically inexistent and I tend to view romantic relationships as a sign that I'm ""worthy"". When I'm feeling ok by myself, dating seems unnecessary."
aromantic,fn7v74x,t1_fn7i2b3,1586728297.0,"Thanks for the reply!! I relate to you in some aspects,  but I think I'm okay with just having someone that loves me platonically with the same intensity that I love them- like my sister. We're super close and I love telling her how good at her hobbies she is and how much of an amazing person she is, and she does the same for me."
aromantic,fn5zvez,t3_fzr53e,1586681959.0,"I know I do 
I'm constantly pressuring myself to be in a relationship but I've tried it enough times to know that dating does not make me happy at all, and my romantic feelings towards people disappear whenever I feel like they're slightly reciprocated. I love the idea of romance but I'm also pressured to be in a romantic relationship cause I associate being romantic loved with being worthy as a person. It's a long journey, but for now I identity as aro, maybe that will change someday."
