I love my friend so much but jealousy is eating me alive. Its not her fault. She just got in a relationship with a guy she's in love with and for understandable reasons he told my ex he has to stop coming over to her place. Also tries to keep communication minimal. She loves me but I hate the fact that my ex is interested in her more than me. But I have no right to be jealous or angry cause we arent in a relationship anymore
My friend is afraid of losing me. I understand. Im afraid of losing her too. She means so much to me. Same from her side of things.
She will never do anything with my ex because shes not in love with him, and also because we are friends. I could never do anything with her ex either.
She says he will get over it.
And that he probably fell in love with the situation instead cause she has a kid and anytime he went over it felt like he had a family of his own. Which I cant give him easily.

I dont care. I could never love him again. I feel so betrayed. And I have had trust issues for a while, so this totally didnt help that either.

Always smell good - wear cologne. Shower, wash your hair, brush your teeth. (Not assuming you arent doing all of that but I know some people that needed to be told this)
