SuicideWatch,fcp9ejk,t3_ei7cir,1577855009.0,It's actually kinda nice to know that there are people out there who feel the same way as i do. I guess i'm not alone in this struggle.
SuicideWatch,fcp9bsn,t3_ei7cir,1577854918.0,Yep that's me haha. no matter what i do i just can't connect with people. when i try to be more talkative i just end up sounding ridiculous then i'll just feel discouraged again. it's just not in me to be more social... it sucks. I have a job that involves communicating with horrible people and it sickens me to the bone. Everyday i want my life to just turn off like a switch
SuicideWatch,ezwzd4y,t3_d2n7fc,1568228550.0,"I feel you man, im feeling so down right now... if only i made the right choices back then, i've wasted soo much time in my youth i could have been a doctor now. Now i look at where i am now and feel nothing but pity over my miserable life. All those wasted opportunites..."
depression,ev563e7,t3_ciclhq,1564228253.0,Currently binging right now bro. Binging all by myself as usual. Its sad but i got used to it now. Still i actually want to have someone beside me but i dont think thats possible.  A loser like me doesnt really have much to go for in life. How are you doing right now man? I hope you're doing good man. Just dont give up okay.
depression,ev54lbi,t3_ciazd5,1564227485.0,"You're not the only one who feels that way man. I guess it has something to do with being an introvert. I want to have friends but i dont like people. Its weird. Maybe im just choosy when it comes to friends. I talk to people that i like and ignore others who i dont. Sad part is that person that i like dont really like me that much but to me i really want to connect with them and spend more time with them, so here i end up being alone as always. Its so hard being a social person and finding happiness in it. Depression really kills the happiness out of everything."
depression,eub4ygo,t3_cfi1xq,1563639793.0,"Been there done that!
It's okay man. Enjoy however you can.
I used to spend my birthdays all alone with an extra large PIZZA, sodas, HD action movies and my PS4..
I was alone but didn't felt lonely. Maybe if i could get a girlfriend someday it'll be a bit more lively."
SuicideWatch,eub4e87,t3_cfez6x,1563639405.0,"I think i've experienced something similar. 
You enjoy the company of this one person so much that you feel content and happy. I felt so comfortable with this girl, she was always willing to listen to everything and was always there to cheer me up. 

To me she was like the whole world,
But to her, i was just one of her friends list. 
To her my presence was nothing special
She was just being nice and friendly
But me, the introvert who found someone who i could connect to was special and precious.

So when she left to work abroad i felt so HEART BROKEN even though we weren't lovers. I cried by myself all alone in my room the day she left. 
I felt so pathetic and lonely
I couldn't connect with anyone else after that
It's so cold and lonely being left behind
It hurts alot..."
depression,et245sl,t3_c9qinx,1562410673.0,"Same here man...
I just cant connect with people
Im not interested in talking with others...
I just like to think to myself...
Its weird... i dont want to be lonely but i dont like people as well
What a fucked up attitude"
