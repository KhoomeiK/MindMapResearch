It is hard to see from the picture, but there are roots coming out of both the bottom hole and the top of the planter. We replanted him from a much smaller pot into his current container maybe 8 or 9 months ago? He is currently living indoors, in a south-west facing window. There is also a grow light on a \~12 hour timer that he is near.

My conundrum is that I have already bought a new pot, that is significantly larger (I don't know what size he is currently in, but his new pot is 16 inches). I need to drill adequate drainage holes in his new home first. BUT, once he gets replanted, I don't really have room for him indoors. I live in a TINY apartment, and the south-west facing window is already full. The Northeast windows at the front of my apartment are also close to capacity, and don't have room for a huge planter.

So I live in zone 8b, in Texas. My question is, can I put him outside without killing him? I have a fairly shaded porch, cause I know they hate full sun. The front porch gets morning sun and then is mostly shaded. But this is Texas and it gets real hot here. Can I increase watering to make up for that? Or am I going to have to sacrifice precious space and put him in front of a door or a set of dressers indoors!

Thank you for your help! He and I really appreciate it."
AmItheAsshole,fn7nm3x,t1_fn7mzis,1586723923.0,"The same thing that is going on now could happen to him. He could grow to resent her cause he feels like he’s doing all the work and she’s not doing anything. I’m not saying it’s logical. People can have a hard time reconciling all the other work that their partners do when they’re not around. It’s just easy to focus on what they’re not doing.

Again they need to sit down and talk about it and decide what works for them. If that’s him doing 100% of the chores, great. If she can do laundry, great. Every couple is different and they need to come to an agreement that works for both of them."
AmItheAsshole,fn7muqy,t1_fn55r0t,1586723488.0,"I agree except that he needs to do every aspect of the housework. Since he is the stay at home now, I think he should definitely be doing the overwhelming majority of the housework. But she can still help around with little things. Maybe a few loads of laundry a week, or running the dishwasher.

But I think mostly they need to sit down and have an adult conversation about how their previous division of labor is now unfair since their circumstances have changed. And together they need to agree on what a fair division is (which may end up being him doing everything, who knows)."
