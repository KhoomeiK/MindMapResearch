antiwork,esi2v4r,t3_c7psmi,1562005758.0,Earlier today my company sent out a measles alert and the first thing I thought was If I would be so lucky as to get it. What a shitty thought just to try and get out of work. What has this all come to?
antiwork,esfooe0,t1_esfdvcl,1561931285.0,Exactly and she is young and lives with family and takes the bus I believe so she should have very few expenses. I'm not sure shes working to any financial goals (she could be) but that's the only reason she would need to work such a soul sucking job for 12+ hours a day.
antiwork,esep12c,t3_c741o5,1561905710.0,"Maybe I'm an asshole but I try not to be friends with co-workers unless I find it comes naturally and we talk about shit other than work. If I'm at work I have to talk about work, go home and family asks about work and it just pisses me off. It consumes so much time in my day there is nothing else to talk about. Then if you become friends with the coworkers you start going on trips together to ""get out of the office"" and you cant find time to see the friends you had from high school or college (the ones that went through pizza face with you and a whole bunch of big life events) because you're working and they are working and there is no fucking time. So you replace your friends with shitty coworkers that don't actually know you from Adam. Then you realize you're 24 and you are barely holding on to your friends, wondering if you'll have to invite your co-workers to your freaking wedding. 

Sorry, rant over."
antiwork,esenibz,t3_c78591,1561904535.0,"We got a new agent a little while ago and she reminds me of myself when I just started out. She works 12 hours a day, taking calls in a call center no less. For some background I'm only 25 and I was asking her why she works so much and she tells me that she has nothing else to do. So I tried explaining to her that she should go home and find something to do like a hobby or something and she just looks at me and says no. It's really weird looking at her and thinking that is who I used to be."
antiwork,esemua3,t3_c7dkqn,1561903991.0,I didn't know this about myself. Clearly I need to work harder so I can get a mortgage at 8.5% that will definitely take me the entire 40 years to repay.
antiwork,esc3drx,t1_esbz4ne,1561819970.0,Not all coworkers are loyal. Some will sell you out just as fast to get a five dollar pay raise and a bag of chips.
antiwork,esaqgxu,t3_c6la19,1561765900.0,"The amount of consumerism that takes place on Fridays, after work, surprises me. It's almost like everyone gets paid and gets out of work on Friday and they just think to themselves ""I'm gonna buy some jeans!"" I have some friends that buy something new every week. The concept of retail therapy drives the economy. I'm not going to lie and say I don't participate in consumerism because I'm not exactly typing this on a stick but I don't just go around buying new shit every Friday."
nihilism,es9xhbb,t3_c6mjce,1561746743.0,"I've always thought about this. The whole point of optimistic nihilism is that nothing matters so do whatever makes you happy or whatever the fuck. You can't just pick up yourself to go to some country if you're broke, you can't quit your job because how you gonna pay your fucking bills and you cant just go out and murder your next door neighbor because their dog won't stop barking... You could probably murder the dog but still..."
antiwork,es9wsed,t3_c6ldsb,1561746298.0,"The obvious thing to say here is work on your book before or after your day job. Try to get it published while your still working and then don't quit your day job until you see that you can be successful. It's ridiculous that you have to fit anything you want to do around work and not the other way around. It's even more ridiculous how you might not even get the time to fit things around a work schedule. You could stop sleeping maybe. /s

There are so many rules to just being able to get a job nowadays that it's an absolute crap shoot. You can't be unemployed for to long, if you quit your last job after only working there for a couple of months then you're unreliable, got fired from your last job then you are a bad employee.

You could maybe work a job that requires you to do very little and in that time work in the book. I've heard security guard is something like that but I cannot confirm."
depression,es4n43t,t1_es46jeh,1561588776.0,Sometimes it just feels really hard to truly let people in to help you carry all of it. I'm just afraid that it's too much to share so I keep it to myself.
depression,es4mqyd,t1_es43mbu,1561588522.0,"I've seen a psychiatrist one time and I'm thinking to go to a different one and maybe start therapy but it's kind of expensive I would actually have to save towards that. I think the things that make me ""negative"" are things that cannot be changed."
depression,es4mkcb,t1_es462zl,1561588395.0,"The people I know don't seem to think so. I'm just really good at avoiding certain topics, conversations and I keep a lot to myself. I'm essentially two people, one broken and sad person when I'm alone and one seemingly whole / fine person when I'm around others."
antiwork,es3nbna,t3_c5q9y7,1561566447.0,"Normal. You can't let anyone else know that you hate work and that you think it's soul sucking because then you are a commi, lazy, have no social life and you are just a waste to society."
antiwork,es3n4hb,t3_c5qs7b,1561566320.0,"The truth is they don't really care. They only want people to think that they care because the customers will feel they can trust that company. My company sent out emails discussing the importance of mental health and sent us information to contact persons if we needed. I will never contact any of the people that they recommended because I just can't trust them to keep my worries confidential. Also, if I speak up about my mental health problems and I take days off I run out of sick days and then they start taking the excess days from my vacation days. 

Don't let the feel good bullshit fool you."
antiwork,es1bzqd,t1_es1ai5k,1561493485.0,Yet still the depressed ones are treated like we are crazy and broken.
antiwork,es1bty2,t1_es19sm1,1561493387.0,I used to love working weekends because I get to be home alone during the week. It's always tough going back knowing there is the rest of the week ahead though.
antiwork,es18tk1,t3_c5cmr5,1561491586.0,I spend most of my year wondering which public / bank holiday is next and hoping that I don't get tapped to work that day. Fridays and Sundays always feel like my hardest days because I know a new week this way comes.
antiwork,es17tz0,t1_es16yr2,1561490988.0,Sometimes I feel that it's just my pessimism or my nihilism that makes me see most of those feel good stories as complete bull. Other times I think people and society have become so unconcerned by the problems around us that they just glazed over everything in order to get to the good part.
antiwork,erz18kb,t1_eryzpcg,1561422994.0,"Apparently chief sustainable officer is not an actual thing. Or she is not interested in you and your colleagues making her job harder with all this research. She gets paid to make it seem like they care, not to actually care."
