from the website:

Peter Watts Rifters trilogy, which started with the publication of “Starfish,” was aptly described by Tor Books as “Psychopaths at the Bottom of the Sea.” For the most part, the three novels take place at the crushing depths of a rift located at the lowest point of the Pacific Ocean. The crew chosen to live in this undersea environment are severe abuse and trauma survivors cybernetically and biologically adapted to survive and thrive in a deep sea habitat. This magnificent specimen of speculative science fiction includes inhabitants adapted to underwater living to such an extent that they have one lung replaced with a gill and gain the ability to breathe using nothing more than water. The trilogy wraps up with “Behemoth” and a frightening apocalyptic scenario. Download all three today!"

Left: The police threatened that they'd frame me. He put some bullets in the pocket of my pants while I wasn't paying attention.

Right: What!!!!! Damn it, are they fucking crazy?

Left: Help me, they said at this point they don't have any evidence to put me behind bars, but later in the police station, they brought me into a dark room. They told me to remove my shirt and my pants and crouch down. They played[sic] me for half an hour, then told me to wear my pants, and led me to touch a bag of bullets in the pocket. They said it's easy to frame me, then told me to keep crouching. They used a bag of bullets to repeatedly rub on my body, they kept rubbing while interrogating me, while also pulling hair from my scalp. 

They said if I don't admit it, They'd put the hair and other things with my DNA on them somewhere that can give me a sentence of more than a decade. 
Sorry, it's a mess. 

Right: Does the lawyer know about this?
