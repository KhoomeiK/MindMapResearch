Constipation,fo4dwzt,t3_fyed79,1587502677.0,"I understand completely. It's beyond frustrating some days to the point where I'm literally ready to cry and beat on my stomach from frustration and anger. And the stress and anxiety it produces just makes it worse. It's something so simple people take for granted. Having a normal functioning body. I'm starting to take magnesium and probiotics daily as well as severely limiting my diet. I'm cutting out all forms of carbohydrates with the exception of some fruits and vegetables. Someone else mentioned keeping a journal and I agree it's extremely important. For me personally, I notice when I'm not active enough (this lockdown has been terrible) when I'm eating certain foods (grains, high fiber foods, starchy foods like potatoes, simple carbs, beans) I tend to have more problems. Bloating, constipation, etc. I think exercising and staying active and very carefully choosing what you eat is imperative."
Constipation,fo4ca78,t1_fo4byd4,1587501865.0,I'm glad to hear! Maybe try incorporating a gentle stool softener into your diet every day. I know it seems excessive but i think it may help. Miralax is good like someone else mentioned. And drink lots of fluids to avoid your colon drying out and masses from forming.
Constipation,fo4bska,t1_fnkeouh,1587501624.0,Any luck? Did u try the magnesium citrate?
Constipation,fo4bkjd,t1_fngznfe,1587501515.0,Yes try glycerin suppositories. They are very helpful. I prefer them to regular laxatives because they work immediately and don't cause cramps. Combine with stool softeners like miralax and PLENTY of warm liquids. Good luck and I hope you feel better!

I think being female makes it more likely as well. Im generally very active, working out at least 3-4 times per week, I had an active job. I was doing best when I was very active and on a schedule. Go to work, eat, go to the gym, eat again. Next morning after coffee I'd generally have a decent bowel movement.

Until some treatment is available otherwise it's literally for nothing because the moment you let people out of their houses it will continue to spread. There is no perfect solution. And the reality is that this virus will have to run it's course be it now or later. Measures can be taken to reduce the amount of deaths such as mandatory mask wearing, providing accomodations for people who are old or sick, etc etc, but this lockdown absolutely cannot continue for much longer."
pics,fnkq1u8,t3_g1x30z,1587036432.0,"650,000 people die every year from heart disease. Yet that doesn't deter people from living unhealthy lifestyles. Why? Because the numbers aren't in front of their faces everyday and they'd probably rather not think about it if it meant having one more donut or one more cigarette. 
There are ways to mitigate the effects of covid19 that don't call for complete shutdown. There are businesses in my city being absolutely torn apart and many of them will not recover. Many of them small businesses that were barely making it to begin with and this was the tipping point. There are many people who literally cannot afford to not work. People who live from paycheck to paycheck. People who are laborers. People who do not have family or support systems of any kind, no one that they can turn to for help. It is absolutely absurd that this is not being considered meanwhile you have many people incredulously believing that all everyone needed to do was to just stay home for a few weeks to allow the medical community to catch up. It takes nearly 2 years to get a vaccine and if something doesn't come out which can effectively treat this within the next month then we need to allow people to return to work because it is NECESSARY."
worldnews,fmyc0hu,t3_fxrbel,1586482670.0,"Honestly, and maybe because I'm in a pissy mood right now for a multitude of reasons, including this quarantine  and not being able to work and make money, it's really hard for me to feel bad for people who don't fucking take care of themselves. It really is. You cause problems not only for yourself but for others as well. And that is a cold fact. More money gets poured into healthcare to help people who are sick simply because of poor fucking choices they made. I can even say this about my own father who I love and who I also live with. His paranoia about contracting this illness is beyond what I can handle at this point but meanwhile he eats like shit, is overweight, has had two heart attacks and a stroke and there is little chance he will ever change despite my efforts. And it makes me so angry.  I'm not rich nor was I brought up with money. In fact we were pretty damn poor growing up. That does not prevent me however from using common sense and using the technology available to us- like this super computer I'm writing on right now known as a smart phone- to educate myself. There is zero reason for ignorance in this day and age. Zero. The resources are there to help you be a better healthier person if you want to be. How about personal responsibility from people."
Coronavirus,fkwuptn,t3_fgi2pi,1584606657.0,"Life has to go on. Businesses have to make money. People have to earn a living. I'd like to know how I'm supposed to pay my rent and take care of my aging parent when I can't go to work and am not getting a paycheck. Precautions can and should be taken. The elderly and other high risk individuals should be staying at home, away from other people if possible (not everyone lives with their parents and grandparents) and  nationwide mandatory mask wearing should be instituted. Even simple measures like this would prevent a lot of people being infected. Aid in the form of monetary assistance and food etc should be given to those who are high risk and cannot leave their homes. However, wtf is going to change in ""a few weeks""  of entire cities like NYC being shut down that's going to make any bit of difference? Are they going to develop a vaccine in a few weeks? No. That may take over a year to get a working vaccine. The reality is that this is being handled the wrong way. If a very small percentage of the population is high risk then those individuals should be keeping themselves away from others as much as possible and for those who can't alternative accommodations should be made or quarantine within certain areas of their home should be instituted. My father stays in his bedroom and I come home and clean and disinfect the house daily. If I should feel ill I would  send him to my sister. But I cannot afford not to work. It is easy for people who can work from home on a computer to say these things. It is unfathomable to me that people believe that this will ""only be a few weeks"".  There are many people who live paycheck to paycheck. Rent is atrociously high in NYC and for many businesses this is an absolute disaster. And it is a disaster for all of the employees who work for these businesses as well. If this is as bad as they say, in ""a few weeks"" when things ""return to normal"" and people go about their lives, unless a dozen new hospitals spring up fully staffed with an enormous amount of equipment, the hospitals and medical community are going to be just as overwhelmed as they would be today."
funny,fkn4nm3,t3_fjflm0,1584353293.0,"Yes the people who are making this out to be the apocalypse and regurgitating garbage information that they've been fed by the media. How can we possibly know that it  has a 3% mortality rate when mass testing isn't being conducted everywhere? Why doesn't this register with people? Why doesn't the fact that Korea has conducted mass testing and clearly shows that <1% of cases are fatal? There are more deaths in Italy because of it's aging population. It's unfortunate that is the case but it is not reason enough for entire cities to be shutting down elsewhere. Businesses need to be able to make money so they can pay their workers. Laborers need to physically be at their jobs to put in their hours. There are many people who can't work at home from a computer and the effects it is having on people financially are already severe and this is only after a few days. 
My advice would be for anyone who is older, especially those who are ill, to remain at home and take precautions. For anyone who is sick don't rush to the hospital unless your fever isn't breaking and/or your condition is worsening after a few days. This is a virus meaning there isn't a cure and you can't just be given antibiotics. Many people will have to ride it out. There are a lot of people rushing to medical centers and hospitals now as soon as they have a cough. The fear and hysteria surrounding this does not help and it puts a strain on the medical community. 
If this were akin to the bubonic plague in terms of how deadly it is I would completely understand the global response we are currently having because that is truly terrifying. But it isn't and for the media to be so misleading and hyperbolic with the information they are espousing, as well as experts coming up with numbers that don't even make sense because they don't have the data to support it, is really a shame. Many people at the end of all this will have suffered enormously financially- potentially losing their homes, businesses, entire savings etc."

funny,fai8tjn,t1_fahp46i,1576102265.0,"Eh...sorry to burst your bubble but the vast majority of what is taught in school is a complete waste of time. 

As a 29 year old I still resent the hell out of the established educational institution for making me learn it in the first place. I struggled with math intensely for years and it didn't help that my anxiety and shyness prevented me from being able to benefit from any sort of tutoring. I passed pre-calculusâ€‹ by the skin of my teeth and I did everything I could to not have to take calculus. Luckily I had enough credits that I could just take a remedial math course senior year and be done with it. It was a breeze.

Apart from the basics, reading, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and yes some problem solving it's an absolute joke what they force kids to study and it has no real life application. In many, dare I say most fields, 90% of what you need to know you learn on the job.

Also, I'm a firm believer that kids should learn survival skills. Like literal survival skills. The flora (and fauna) of the world, particularly the region they live in. How to make a fire, a shelter, how to use a compass and navigate, how to SWIM for the love of God. Basic shit everyone should know but we are so far removed from the natural world that these things are considered unimportant or silly. I can't tell you how many grown people I know who cannot swim. That's just a shame. 

Kids should also be taught trades. How to work with their hands and build, how to MAKE THINGS. How to make clothing, woodwork, etc. THESE are skills that are being lost but are so important."
AskReddit,f8gdyz1,t1_f7w9h0b,1574558094.0,"The problem with that is it doesn't instill the necessary fear in others who are thinking of doing the same kinds of things to people. If someone knows that if they are caught they will suffer it will help to dissuade them from doing these atrocious acts. Will it stop everyone? No. But it will certainly make many of them think twice.  Rapists, sex traffickers, and child abusers especially should have a tracking collar put on them and thrown into the freezing fucking wilderness hundreds of  miles from civilization."

My heart breaks for the little ones who are taken so easily because they do not want to be rude or are too trusting. How many monsters there are in this world.
