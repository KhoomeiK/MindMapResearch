depression,fewlvi5,t1_fewkk64,1579414022.0,"I completely understand. Medicine is scary. Your concerns aren't odd, silly, or anything else. Your concerns are *valid*.

From what you've described, your medicine is beneficial. It helps you get out of bed and socialize. Both of those things are very important. Just because your meds don't fix everything doesn't mean they don't do good things for you.

Personally, I would recommend you keep taking them. While your concerns are genuine, they're also concerns that haven't arised yet. You should certainly stop taking your meds if they cause problems for you.

But they haven't (at least from what you've told me) caused problems with you yet. I think it would not be in your best interest to stop. Keep with it, and if problems you aren't comfortable with arise, then you should stop taking them.

But also, I'm not your psychiatrist, and I'm not you. If you want to stop taking your meds for any reason, do it. I'm just here to offer my own perspective and advice. But I do hope your consider what I've said."

 I'm not a professional, this is not medical advice, i dont want to scare you, and I implore you to take this with a grain of salt, but this sounds like schizophrenia to me. I dated a diagnosed schizophrenic before, and what you describe in this post all sounds very familiar to me.

You need to see a professional as soon as you can. Schizophrenia commonly onsets during early adulthood, and waiting to see a professional can lead to bad mental consequences. Again, I recommend seeing a professional.

depression,fewj51u,t3_eqsa2o,1579411619.0,"Similar problem here. I've had major insomnia in the past, as well as other issues like sleep paralysis. The only way I can sleep now is if I'm drunk (this is not advice, DO NOT TRY THIS). 

My only advice is to not try to sleep. If you're laying in bed for hours, you aren't helping yourself. Get up and do some shit. It's surprising how sleepy you can get when your aren't trying to sleep."
depression,fewihn0,t3_eqs2p0,1579411214.0,"Hey, I think I can help here. Several (intelligent) people close to me have claimed I'm a sociopath. I've been clinically tested for sociopathy twice. The consensus seems to be that I have many sociopathic tendencies, but I'm technically not a sociopath. I say this to let you know that I understand how you feel.

First things first. If you're hurting, if you're worried about yourself, if you're feeling down, you aren't a sociopath, and you aren't going to be one.

Second, being a ""sociopath"" isn't fun, it's not going to solve your problems, and it WON'T make you feel better. Depression makes us feel a lot of horrible things: sadness, anger, apathy, disdain towards life, and cynicism. Sociopathy does nothing to help this. 

As someone who has many ""sociopathic tendencies"" I can tell you they don't make you feel better. In fact, the sociopathic ""feelings"" (can you even call them that?) feel very reminiscent of classic depressive symptoms. A lack of emotion, a numbness, a general lack of emotion and caring about anything...

It isn't a good feeling. A common misconception about disorders like sociopathy is that it's a ""superpower,"" that it will help because if you can't feel anything, you can't be in pain. I'm here to tell your that there isn't a difference. Bad feelings and a lack of feeling is eerily similar; they both feel awful.

My advice? Don't numb yourself. Don't throw yourself into a hole of apathy. It's not one you can easily dig yourself out of.

Instead, as hard as it is, and how wrong as it feels, embrace the thing you hate the most, your feelings. And yes, I mean the really bad ones. I'm not saying you should buy into all the horrible things you may think about yourself. What I am saying is that ignoring these feelings, pushing them away, will leave you worse off.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope you find your peace. What you're going through sucks, and I hope you get through it. 

Take care."
