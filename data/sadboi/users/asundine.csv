I don't know your son or what his goals are but if he's happy with his career choices then that is what matters. Your opinion of them does not matter. This sounds like a classic case of ""dad knows best and he refuses to think otherwise"". My dad had that attitude and that only made me want to go against his wishes more when I was a teenager.

That being said, it is your money and it's your place to do with it what you wish which is why I'm going with NTA. I think though it wouldn't hurt you to support your son a bit in these hard times. Instead of writing him a check, take him car shopping and then pay for the car out of the funds."
