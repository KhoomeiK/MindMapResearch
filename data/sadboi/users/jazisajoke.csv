Jason had a messed up past granted (NAT, Ali stuff) and not to excuse his actions under the whole “boys will be boys” argument cause that’s trash, but he wassss a high school boy when most of it went down (and we know how dumb they can be). 

Ezra was a grownnn when the bulk of his shittiness went down and was her TEACHER!! (Why he didn’t just let her switch classes like she wanted baffled me) 

Jake was a sweetie, as far as I remember, haven’t gotten to him yet in my rewatch but I don’t remember him doing anything shitty so I’m sure they’d be cute af. 

Jason deserved more 😭"

PrettyLittleLiars,fr2s19q,t1_fr2rf2u,1589842781.0,"Exactly, cause it was an already dodgy relationship that you justify cause of 'love' but 4B just destroyed that for me. I would have been totally fine with him still lurking around after redeeming himself, but helping them find A and respecting Aria in her new relationship but I **could not** see a reason I'd ever let him back in my life like that.

bless you hun :( literally only had this awakening last summer, but yeah I was also the friend that was always seeing older guys and everyone thought it was cool 😓😓"
PrettyLittleLiars,fr2o93q,t1_fr2mzgo,1589840794.0,"Like everything he does and everything she says to justify it just makes me cringe so bad I wanna protect her. 

At least I had a few friends towards the end who snapped me out of the daze, but literally none of her friends see it as an issue and I can’t blame them too much cause a lot of mine also didn’t— BUT I still had someone my age who knew it was wrong. 

Her and Jake should have been OTP idec. Even her and Emily would have made more sense."

I 100% agree that this show really helped me out when I needed it. Will be rewatching it whenever I need a boost. Shows like this, adventure time, Steven universe, have so many layers and I hope Noelle takes on another show! I’d love to see her take on another older show (I can imagine the genius she could do with W.I.T.C.H of Bratz) or even just something completely never seen before!"

HIMYM,fqpca53,t1_fqpb596,1589542366.0,"That is fair enough. 

I mean the kids thing to me at least is a bit irrelevant now cause his kids are teenagers now which is generally a lot less maintenance than smaller children so I doubt that things would really affect her too much on that end. And they both seem to love their Aunt Robin. 

I felt it did make sense for Robin to get lonely (definitely don’t agree with them making her look that old but they did the same to Ted so I can’t really complain) but she’s always been one to push people away despite really needing them as we’ve seen through out the show. She has been independent and successful but no one wants to be alone. I think it’s natural that after accomplishing your dreams you start to wonder about family and all those other things. 

I just think the story is about the different types of love and relationships that people end up being in through out their lives. One was Robin and One was Tracy. I’m not saying they’d be together till they died but it definitely made sense that they would both want to see how things would go between them now that all that other stuff wasn’t in the way. 

The Alternate ending wraps things up in a neat, nostalgic bow but I personally liked the more “what does this mean” angle, cause I like a cliffhanger and the possibilities."
HIMYM,fqpadaw,t1_fqp9pan,1589540605.0,"I don’t think he was waiting for the chance. I do believe the greatest love of his live was Tracy. The way he talks about her, the crazy similarities (like the driving gloves). But she died! I don’t think he would have ever thought about Robin that way again if Tracy was still in the picture, at least from what we were shown he never does that. 

Plus in one of the scenes that didn’t make it into the final episode, Robin comes on to Ted and he rejects her. Something 30 year old Ted would have never been able to do. Ted clearly loved Tracy, I just think 6 years is definitely an acceptable time to mourn your wife and consider dating an old flame. And I think it’s pretty natural when you’re telling your kids you’re entire life story to realise things you probably hadn’t. 

Hindsight goes a long way, but I don’t think he’s completely fallen back in love with her, I think it was more a matter of realising how much emotion he had for her, the only woman apart from Tracy (the actual love of his life) that he truly truly loved and that something could come from this. 

Granted those scenes were cut for time, but if you haven’t watched those then definitely do cause I think they give a better rounded view of the series and make things come into view a bit https://youtu.be/WS0xaSTvPQw 

Still I know that’s just my opinion cause I’ve never hated the finale as much as most people did I guess."
BoJackHorseman,fq95kt7,t1_fq8mw69,1589186360.0,Yeah I think questioning voices is the best way really. I started therapy this year for the first time and that piece of advice really helped!! Sadly I’ve had to stop cause of the virus but I’m trying to keep the skills.
BoJackHorseman,fq95gi1,t1_fq8mszb,1589186236.0,Thank you for the encouragement! I do recognise I’m not in Bojack’s boat at all cause I’ve acknowledged my issues early on and I’m trying to do better and make smarter choices and love myself more so that definitely a massive step in the right direction.
BoJackHorseman,fq8dmwz,t1_fq6ota7,1589163823.0,Honestly that really petrified me cause I’m only 18 and I’ve been dealing with those voices for the past 4 years and the thought I could be Bojack’s age and still have them full on sent me in to panic mode. Had to stop watching for a few days.
HIMYM,fq8dea5,t1_fq87vym,1589163668.0,I don’t think it was that they weren’t compatible in the long run. I think it was that they met at the wrong time. Robin was career focused and didn’t want kids and Ted was all about the white picket fence. At the end Robin had had her fabulous career and done all she wanted and so did Ted. They always had such strong feeling for each other and 6 years is a longgg time before you get with an ex again. Idk I guess I’ve never been that angry at the ending. Just wish we got to see Tracy more.

rupaulsdragrace,fpaxy79,t3_gbwp3r,1588458029.0,"Never been more convinced of this shows rigging

This weeks episode has only convinced me 100% that the entire game is meticulously planned out. 

My first suspicion was the fact the library hadn’t been opened yet and if there was no reading challenge that meant it would have to happen next week with only 5 contestants which is not usually the case. 

Gigi Goode not being in the bottom cause that basic out fit was “chic” was another

And then just for them to save Jackie too?? 

That means they knew from the start they were doing a double save and definitely put Jackie in there to assure she’d be able to hold her own against Heidi and make it look less suspicious. 

Do y’all get what I mean?

BoJackHorseman,fmdv0fd,t3_fuc1cd,1585978835.0,"As much as I love Times Arrow, Old Sugarman’s Place and The view from Halfway down have my heart. 

Old Sugarman”’s place perfectly introduces us to the start of the inter generational trauma and it definitely allows us to humanise Beatrice a lot more. It’s a heartbreaking story also beautiful animated with how they use the flashbacks. Honestly stunning. 

The view from halfway down can’t have enough praise in adding to the existential dread of life and the finality of death. 

Times arrow is a lovely episode too don’t get me wrong. Giving us a much better look at Beatrice and Bojack’s relationship and Hollyhocks mothers scribbled face still leaves me in awe. It’s a great episode. But without Old Sugarman’s Place it wouldn’t be as strong as it was. 

Just my thoughts. 🥺"

Sexual attraction is an innate part of human beings. You can’t force/be angry at people for it. I can imagine it’s hard but being bitter doesn’t solve a thing
