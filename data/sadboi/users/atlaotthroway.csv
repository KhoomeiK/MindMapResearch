BPD,fqlfba9,t1_fqlezqh,1589456470.0,Me too :)
BPD,fqkswrn,t3_gj4u8j,1589435363.0,OP. This is me. I never saw myself making it past 18. Now 25 is the next age I truly plan on never seeing. Iâ€™m currently 23 and will be turning 24 in Nov. I really donâ€™t want to make it past 25. Iâ€™m so done with everything & this emotional turmoil.
BPD,fqdjji1,t1_fqcrfw7,1589291022.0,Same. I just had to delete all of it because of this reason alone. I was tired of driving myself insane day in and day out :(
coolguides,fq8i460,t3_gh0suw,1589166719.0,Sooo if I get a tattoo of slit wrists I should receive the level of pain Iâ€™m looking for ðŸ‘€ Good to know.
BPD,fptgyv9,t1_fpseovu,1588891065.0,I use to do this all the time when I worked day shift and I would be driving home at night. I would never remember the ride home. I always remembered clocking out & just being at home. I switched to night shift and I donâ€™t experience it anymore. Well not as much. I find myself dissociating anytime I do something I consider second nature.

Iâ€™m not sure if it works like that in Android as well. 

Hope this helps :)"
BPD,fpd8t91,t3_gcp3jp,1588522187.0,"Yes. 

I deleted FB over a year ago. I deleted IG yesterday. Even when I had both of those accounts I never posted anything & I havenâ€™t spoke to any of the people I followed in I donâ€™t know how long. So I deemed it all pointless and deleted it. 

Now I just have Reddit and Tumblr because I can maintain my anonymity."
BPD,fpbipgk,t1_fp9d090,1588470921.0,I noticed that recently about myself. Whenever Iâ€™m upset I begin to become physically sick.
BPD,fp9d750,t1_fp9c6q6,1588422887.0,"Nope, OP. Youâ€™re definitely not alone when it comes to anger."
BPD,fp9c170,t3_gc4r91,1588421842.0,Yes. Thatâ€™s the one emotion I try to steer clear of at all cost. I loose all sense of control and I end up hating myself for it. Iâ€™m at my worst when Iâ€™m angry.
