GoodPizzaGreatPizza,foi20gd,t1_foi03pr,1587777096.0,"The revenue loss wouldn't be as much as I had previously calculated since the buddy doesn't put the max possible amount of sauce (same goes with cheese as well). As per my new calculation the loss would be around $8. I'll still wait for laciewings to cross-check once if she comes up with any new findings. But I guess $8 wouldn't make much of a difference considering you'd be making ~$100 profit daily. You can always watch some ads for extra cash, though. Oh by the way you can consider getting the cutter buddy. I wish I had it earlier."
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fohzher,t1_fohwfr5,1587775664.0,"Hey thank you so much for the help. I made a post about buddies yesterday, you can check that out if it is of any help to you.  ðŸ˜Š"
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fohdjzn,t1_fohcbfp,1587764160.0,Oops sorry I meant sauce. Can you do the test with sauce?
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fohaxpp,t3_g7d60s,1587762933.0,"I got all the buddies from chapter 1 toppings except sauce and cheese. I don't remember the exact order I bought them but basically I went with the most ordered ones. Well, eventually you'll be getting all the buddies anyway so the order really doesn't matter. I started buying at around day 40 during which I was I was getting more olive and onion orders. I guess it's different for everyone. 

Since you have the cheese buddy, would you be kind enough to do a little test? You just have to place the dough, note the money you're having (say X), then let the buddy put ONLY sauce fully and note the money again (say Y). Could you tell me how much you're getting in Y-X? Thanks."
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,foh7bqt,t1_foh377q,1587761337.0,Damn. I thought you could sync between the mobile and the PC version. ðŸ˜ž I hate to start things over from the scratch.
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fogtfjy,t1_fofb6m9,1587756778.0,"I did some math with putting the sauce. The way I put sauce is going from outside towards inside in a circular manner (I believe most players do it that way) which takes barely a second and costs $0.85 on average (and the customers never complain). To simulate how much sauce a buddy would be putting, I added the maximum amount possible costing $2.5. So that's a difference of $1.65 per pizza. (Screenshot:  https://imgur.com/Ckh52m3)  I haven't tested with cheese but I believe it will nearly be the same so for each pizza I would be losing $1.65\*2= $3.3. On an average I sell 12 pizzas everyday so that's a loss of $40 daily with both the sauce and cheese buddies activated. I guess I'd rather buy the cutting buddy and move on to buying chapter 2 toppings. Please rectify if my calculations were incorrect."
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fof1cwm,t1_fodx5aw,1587722417.0,"Just a question, why do you restart instead of just playing on? This might be a noob question but I actually started playing a few days ago."

GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fo78zcx,t3_g609gb,1587574296.0,I got my chapter 2 at day 30. I thought it was the same for everyone.

GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fo1uhpi,t1_fo1tyyc,1587441780.0,How are things different on the Steam version? Could you list out a few pros and cons? Isn't it a bit hectic to put the toppings on a computer? Seems like it's easier to tap on a small screen than to click on a bigger screen.

GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fnwxa4f,t3_fzubqq,1587327262.0,Does the daily profit stays almost the same? I mean I'm playing day 20 and I've been making about $70 profit daily too.
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fnwjiiu,t1_fnw8eed,1587319571.0,I was also thinking about getting the topping buddies because I am not super fast when it comes to putting the toppings. Applying sauce/cheese doesn't take much time.
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fnw8089,t1_fnw7n5v,1587313261.0,I just had a order for 3 sausage+olive pizzas and I realised I was taking a lot of time to put 3*(18+18) toppings. Also had to make sure those 18 were spaced out properly. I'll still do a test run to see how the day goes.
GoodPizzaGreatPizza,fnw70d4,t1_fnw2fac,1587312696.0,"Hey thanks for the detailed answer. I was going through the GPGP wiki and it said 18 units of topping is the perfect one (just like you said it should be 3 unit/slice). But won't I be overspending that way? I mean the customers seem to be happy with my current 12, they only complain if I do 10/11 or less.  This also the reason I'm skeptical about getting the buddies since they're going to put 18 units."

This practice is pretty much prevelant mostly in villages in some 3rd world countries. It's so sick to imagine people still follow this in 2019. I  don't get it why guys are so obsessed with their girlfriend's virginity. Her virginity is her past. Your bf was clearly a jerk. What a sick man would his father check his girlfriend's virginity! Trust me,  there are more guys like him in the world and I wish they would use their senses. I'm so glad you left him. More power to you, girl. Xoxo"
