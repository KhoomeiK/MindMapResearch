I did feel like mocking or badmouthing her, but as I knew precisely well how lonely she must feel I just couldn't. 

Anyway she did not come back the next day but returned to her old school. 

I have to admit I did mock her slightly a couple of months later once when I met her on the street (I mean she was back with her friends now and had made my life hell for years... still, not proud of that in hindsight...), she didn't react and just stared at her shoes and passed me by.
