depression,fdf7u5s,t3_ekwbox,1578355320.0,Some time ago I gave up getting better. I don't think it's possible for me and failing to do so makes it worse.
depression,f7sgc3e,t3_dxg5nl,1573994456.0,I used to but I've come to realize that people broke me and I'm alone holding the pieces
depression,f76lkr7,t3_duda1u,1573429613.0,Happy Birthday
depression,f4cuusg,t3_dk6vmu,1571534180.0,"For me yes and no. Sometimes I feel awful and lonely and just eat, even if I'm not hungry and regret doing it. And sometimes I just can't muster the strength to make food and feel like I don't want to eat."
depression,f34op2q,t3_cml6ni,1570657340.0,"Moving at the end of the month, uncertain factors related to it just give me a great deal of anxiety. Not feeling like I have enough help with the move, not wanting to make the necessary phone calls or file the necessary papers etc. Taking a leap of faith with the move, just hoping there will be more job opportunities there, more people who accept me, something to keep me going. 

Lately I just feel so tired, unmotivated and unable. Not sure how to keep going and how to start feeling better. Lately I feel nothing I do makes me feel better."
depression,f2krbl1,t3_ddjmzt,1570288574.0,"Yes, to an extent that I'd even say people who don't like the movie have never had issues and don't understand people with them.  I'd say it was very relatable and it made me super uncomfortable."
depression,f0n7a30,t3_d5d5lq,1568762433.0,"Not the same but I feel somewhat similar situation here. I am a teacher, I am trained and supposed to aid and find youth struggling with these issues among the other things that I do but I can't even fix myself. I feel pathetic and inadequate."
depression,f0im76f,t1_f0g5a7m,1568643773.0,"I would argue most social interactions we have are ""seeking for attention"". From spontaniously asking how people are doing to sharing something that happened. I think people just stigmatize what they find uncomfortable and can't be bothered with as attention seeking, which is their shortcoming as a person and not ours. 

We all need attention."
pcgaming,ere0mj1,t1_ere0kzt,1560768368.0,Don't quote me on this but I think it had some crowdsourced translations made and some of the asian translations turned out to be really really bad so they review bombed it.
pcgaming,erdz3vi,t1_erduckh,1560766031.0,Darkest Dungeon review bomb seemd hardly deserved.

But Midgar also has so much potential. Honestly, what happens to Avalanche and how we are suddenly supposed to care would be much better with some context or time spent with them. Midgar is also aesthetically amazing and there is so much potential in the every day of the rich and the poor."
PS4,eqsn55e,t1_eqshkgj,1560288777.0,"If it really is a 60-hour-game (60 hours of story, not 20 + 40 hours of fluff) like implied, then I really don't see a problem with the splitting into several parts."
PS4,eqd5lk8,t3_by4hnv,1559984078.0,"It's in my top 10 for sure, a pretty amazing game."
PS4,epae916,t3_bub18l,1559126568.0,Would love to see an early release date. Just so tired of the journalist / industry pundit circlejerk that Kojima games take 10 thousand years to make. I really hope the change in work environment and publisher has sped up his process.
depression,eohcix7,t3_brsy1y,1558578117.0,"Yes, and every time it comes with a ""realization"" that I won't ever be happy."
