I had tried 10 different meds and my psych was about to put me on lithium. I saw an ad for a drug, asked about it, and they decided to try it before lithium as the last line of defense. 

Shit worked. It’s like a god damn miracle drug, but my insurance doesn’t like paying for it (it’s 1200/mo and I fill that shit religiously) so I live in fear of lithium, but this drug literally saved my life.
