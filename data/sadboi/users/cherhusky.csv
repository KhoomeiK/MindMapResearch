bisexual,folzb1b,t1_folm2ru,1587874141.0,"I think im just a little worked up about the whole ‚Äúliking‚Äù thing because i looked through his likes on twitter before and saw that he was spamming this girls page. Later, i found out that they were dating before but i just found it disrespectful! And later, i looked over his phone and saw that he searched her up. I was a little weirded out since we were together and i didnt know why she was brought up. Its still in the back of my mind and idk if this whole ‚Äúliking‚Äù pics became a think BECAUSE that was a problem. Since it seems like youre a secure person, can i ask you if you thinm its suspicious that that happened? Or am i being a little crazy? 

And yes i totally agree with you! Its a trust thing, and an insecurity thing as well /: so thats a my bad on my part"

mentalillness,fnrxn7w,t3_g3ae1w,1587205553.0,"I wish i had a therapist in highschool, i was in hs almost 2 years ago. I was in your same position, my friends were valedictorians and i was the dumb one in my friend group, failed in alot of my classes. And was even ridiculed by my teachers. I cried or had an outburst weekly. Ill tell you something that helps me get through the day, or something that ive heard: try to get through the day, try your best and if you fail.. who cares? You live, then you die. Thats life really. I was very suicidal in hs and honestly sometimes i still am. But i remind myself that im going to try my best until im around 35/40 years of age. If i dont like my life till then, then i will commit suicide. If you fail, yes it really does suck but whats the point of not trying again? Or a different approach. I feel u on this so much, but trust me and just try till youre 35/40, then you can make ur decision whether or not tl die.

I think of 40 years old as, living childhood, teenage years, 20s is for experimentation and when i ‚Äútry‚Äù to figure out what i wanna do, 30 is when i decide if i like my life, 40 is my ultimate decision. It sounds horrible but it helped me"
relationship_advice,fmwvoyx,t3_fxlmga,1586453864.0,"Everything you explained in the comments and in your story, i was the best friend before. Let me tell you, your best friend can only go so far to help you with this. I too had to pick up my friend from the side of the road because her bf kicked her out of his car. I witnessed my bff‚Äôs bf scream at her calling her a stupid fuck. She also didnt have any friends, but because her bf didnt want her to have friends. When she left, she was so torn but being in that relationship caused her trauma. After a couple months, she healed, partied, made new friends, and she got so much healthier mentally and physically. May this isnt the same situation, bad temper or not NO ONE should disrespect you like that. He can try to be better but he CHOOSES not to. You shouldnt tolerate his bad temper, he should learn how to control it, if he cant then that shows you who he really is and how much respect he has for you."

Anxietyhelp,fitwxnl,t3_f9a67n,1582731133.0,"Like others said, try to embrace being alone. I was in a position where the thought that i was alone gave me such pains in my chest. But I remembered that i was lonely, not alone. I always had someone, but the thoughts that they didnt want to see me or i felt like a bother. I didnt end up talking to them bc of my anxiety, but i tried being logical and i think i was overthinking it (‚Äúthink‚Äù bc im still not sure and would like to hope so). I started by going to in n out to eat by myself, and had a drawing date with myself at a scenery. Then i went to the mall alone, and had a me day where i treated myself out. Afterwards, eating alone and going to places alone became an easier task. Doesnt mean you shouldn‚Äôt completely ignore everyone in your life. i found a balance between me, peers, and work."
