I‚Äôm failing my classes, I lost my job, quit all my hobbies, lost all my friends, lost my girl, lost my sanity. I had a lot of hope starting on zoloft but things got worse so I had to stop taking it and my life is getting worse and worse faster and faster exponentially. My brain is incredibly dysfunctional and people always ask me why I try so hard to be normal and it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm abnormal and my brain chemistry‚Äôs fucked and even the doctors know it. My perception and ability to comprehend what‚Äôs going on and act accordingly was bad from the start but is worsening.  I would much rather be dead than suffer alive. It‚Äôs essentially torture"

mentalhealth,fg0p3ky,t3_ewan6f,1580412264.0,"it feels like I don‚Äôt automatically understand people or have the innate social sense/ability to communicate the way humans do. Like I noticed people are really good at understanding each other and each other‚Äôs situations by instinct/second nature/gut feeling/subconsciously and I just can‚Äôt do that. And I have no sense of identity or purpose like idk who I am. Like I‚Äôm really impressionable and easy to influence. Another thing is that I get really attached to people and when they leave I feel way more pain than what makes sense. It also feels like since I‚Äôve spent 17 years wiring my brain this way, treatment will only tweak my reality instead of transforming it."
