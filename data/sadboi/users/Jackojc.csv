linux_gaming,fe4mdh8,t1_fe4bojc,1578860839.0,Yes but this post is comparing a program from an entirely userspace perspective.
linux_gaming,fe49w9p,t1_fe46kd3,1578857173.0,"Depending on the program, say `htop` here, 400% would signify full utilization on all cores, not 100%. Haven't used windows in a while but last I remember, 100% was full core utilization. Obviously in this case that probably means it's even more efficient on Linux but I was just trying to make the point that it's probably not a good benchmark of performance or efficiency with many differences between both platforms, some you pointed out yourself."
