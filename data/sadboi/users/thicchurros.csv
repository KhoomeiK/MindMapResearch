antinatalism,fdj6mb2,t3_elmojd,1578459912.0,"if the ""demonic shit"" theyre talking about refers to hell or the belief of reincarnation, then i dont think why it would matter. antinatalist wouldnt really cause ""more"" suffering, but just the same amount that the act of being alive would do. that is because if youre alive, you can i guess do good deeds or bad and have youre destiny set for. but if you're antinatalist, or maybe just not born,  then you still have those two options, (only if its true that god or whoever doesn't actually send everybody to hell for ending their life etc) so i feel like it would be the same amount of suffering, not more that the pronatalist give. and we have no proof that reincarnation is real so we shouldn't even get into that, just stuff that we can actually control"
