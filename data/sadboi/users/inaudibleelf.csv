Some stupid bloke came in at me and called me sexiest because I pointed out that he, as a male, has no right to say what a woman could do with her body. I also said that in my mind life doesn't begin at conception, however he kept saying any biologist would tell you it does. 

I checked his post history and he was a contributer to r/prolife and would go out on ""march for life"" protests in NYC. I'm so glad I live in England. Here in England it isn't such a big deal at all, and I've never seen an anti-abortion protest like you get in America."

You'll never change my mind, and I'm lucky to live in a country where fanatics men like you can't decide what right I have to my own body.

To add - closing abortion clinics won't stop abortions, they'll just make them way more dangerous.
