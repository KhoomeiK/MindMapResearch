SonicTheHedgehog,fq28w8k,t1_fq1y5yc,1589053882.0,It has by far the best plot and character development out of any Sonic game. It has the most freedom and player agency in it's gameplay mechanics. And the fucking chao garden. People who shit on SA2 and SA1 for that matter just suck at the game.

INTP,fpwxce6,t1_fpwx449,1588971688.0,Not exactly. In communism everybody has equal pay regardless of their occupation. Not that there is no currency at all. The government is at the highest class where as everyone else is equal. So technically there are still classes.
INTP,fpwx0ht,t1_fpwwn6b,1588971515.0,In a communist system there is still laws being enforced and currency. Why does it matter if it’s stateless?

INTP,fpww5jr,t1_fpwv885,1588971070.0,"But here’s the thing. With political systems like communism and authoritarianism, they both end up with the same result.

INTP,fpwufpn,t1_fpwu1zo,1588970173.0,In socialism and communism there is still hierarchy. Those are the far left positions. Like how fascism is the far right. Anarchism (depending on the type I guess) has no politics. I don’t see how it could be considered far left.
INTP,fpwrq0i,t3_gefffl,1588968756.0,That would never be me. I'm admittedly extremely opinionated when it comes to music. Also Cardi B's music is objectively awful.

progrockmusic,fpu5ygx,t1_fpu4yjv,1588905388.0,"Let me put it to you this way. There are a lot of amazing prog bands that came out during the 80’s-2000’s. Meshuggah, ISIS, Tool, Cynic, Atheist, Death, Anathema, Opeth and Porcupine Tree being great examples. But they’re all standing on the shoulders of giants. It’s the same reason Bill Nye isn’t as respected as Isaac Newton. Sure he may technically know more about science than Newton, due to the time period he was born in.

bigdickproblems,fktg1em,t3_fjze3o,1584518155.0,Could be due to the way your dick bends. I have a hook dick. Bend upwards and to the left. The angle and position that it bends at drastically affects how it looks. Also you could just be tall with long legs and big hands like me.
