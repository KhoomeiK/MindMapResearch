But really, reptiles aren't really ""pets"" and noone should treat them like one. Of course I show affection to mine but I keep in kind he doesn't love me. The only reason I keep reptiles is because they are fascinating and that's also why I go herping and read books about my favorite reptiles."

My mom and dad dont believe me either but I dont care about that. So anyways, I was in the shower and then I just got a thought of my aunt anita's crying at my grave and then I started crying.

reptiles,fqn6sit,t3_gjtx48,1589489632.0,"Okay so there are obviously a lot of choices for a starter reptile. Bearded dragons, Blue tongues, and those ""quirky"" geckos which are reptiles everyone has.

Reptiles aren't really pets. They are more of a looky looky thing and not so much touchy touchy. I keep my reptiles in bioactive enclosures nowadays to instinct natural behaviours. If you want a reptile that not many people have and one that is a bit of a handful, get an ackie monitor. These aren't the best starter pets but since you have 1 to 2 years to research, that's more than enough time for one of these guys. Another one I suggest is the chinese water dragon. Full of personality.

Another thing to mention, a lot of reptiles are pricey. Not as in cost to get the reptile but the things you'll need for the reptile."

BeardedDragons,fqbcpx7,t3_ghv9is,1589234585.0,"Gutload some dubias, mealworms, hornworms, or crickets and let the little one much on some. Then get a dropper and refill with some water and gently put drops on its head and move it around with your finger and if he licks it off keep doing that till he's hydrated. After you could offer him dandelion greens. I have a lot in my backyard and mine loves them. Make sure to wash them thoroughly though because of those nasty pesticides. Also over the course of a few weeks try handling, trust building and enrichment. I love how you really care about your new friend and that is what makes a good reptile keeper. A trick to build trust is to pick up a hornworm and put it away from him and put your arm out in a way that it would have to climb across your arm to get it. I even taught mine that when I make a clicking noise it means food time! Too bad that one passed, I'm focusing on the same things with my new one. Best of luck to you."
