https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/salt-pepper/lo-salt-reduced-sodium-salt-alternative-350g

Your body needs both sodium (table salt) and potassium to survive and on keto you don't get it from food so you'll need 5-10g a day to not have headaches, tiredness and muscle cramps , most people quit keto because they don't get enough electrolytes so I'd recommend stocking up. 

Also magnesium glycinate is another must if you're gonna do it for more than a month, will help with sleep (don't get regular magnesium is doesn't get absorbed by the body) good luck!"
