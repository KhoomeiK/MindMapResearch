She drugged her friends and left them passed out in enemy territory in the beginning of a war to do some stupid plan that didnt work. She married an Uchiha they are known for their visual powers and her child needs glasses. Not only is she useless she also created the most usless child in the Uchiha bloodline."

EatingDisorders,fmfwtm6,t3_fuyyqg,1586036500.0,You've already admitted you have a problem thats the first step so congrats on that. Step 2 is getting the help you need starting with getting professional help and being honest with those close to you. People care and want to see you thrive you deserve happiness. Its going to be terrifying but you just have to keep putting that one foot in front of the other. I belive in you man you can do this. üëç

What kind of role model is that? If he is unwilling to get his act together the relationship is already over dont drag it out and make it worse on yourself. You arent his caregiver if he cant make it work 50/50 find someone better."
relationships,fl6scm0,t3_fmt9ur,1584881828.0,"Hes not a good person to be around and have a future with the golden line of anyone in an abusive or about to be heavily abusive relationship is ""hes great unless hes drunk"" my mother used it to excuse my father and my oldest sister used it on her boyfriend until he killed her. Do not waste your time with toxic people if they threaten self harm or suicide without you definite sign you need to leave. Hes a grown adult and is responsible for his own decisions you deserve to be with someone who makes you safe and happy and right now he isnt doing that so please leave before its too late."
relationships,fl6rvb4,t3_fmc7q4,1584881370.0,Glad to hear you're doing better you deserve happiness and people who wont backstab you. Cutting people out is hard but sometimes is the best option I'm glad you had the courage to not hold on and let them continue to be toxic to you. I wish you nothing but the best.
relationships,fl6rm1w,t3_fmvwgh,1584881128.0,"Take time away from social media and figure out who you are and then stay honest and true to yourself. Its better to be hated for whst you are than to be loved for what you are not. And those who will not accept the real you were never those you needed in your corner to begin with. You cant change your parents but you can try talking to them if that doesnt work arrange skype sessions and facetime those who care about you will make time for you. Don't worry about whats popular and being there for everything people sometimes socially peak later on in life. I'm much more socially active at 20 than I've ever been in my entire life and im grateful I bloomed later because it's made me more grounded to who I am, who I surround myself with, and how I present myself. You do not need anyones approval but your own, the gratification others give you is only temporary and holds as much meaning as you let it."

Shes in the wrong here not you, bisexual isnt an excuse to hoe around (sorey for the bluntness but its needed sometimes). Shes just making bisexuals look bad and frankly my man its time to move on. If you cant trust her (she deserves no trust btw based on her actions) its like a phone with no service, what do you do? Play games. Life is too short to spend time and effort on those not worth it don't waste more time."

I wanted to wait for April so I could be here for my mothers birthday but it looks like thats not going to happen. My boyfriend owns his own cafe and im very worried about how long this panicking is going to ensue and how it'll impact us financially. Trying to stay hopeful though its been a rough month i already lost my Great Grandfather prior to the epidemic, I wish everyone the best though and hopefully we can all make it out okay."

My SO is against me returning which I understand from his perspective since I did get injured, a close friend of mine made some comments about me not going back in and choosing this path and had me questioning if I'm really doing the right thing."
