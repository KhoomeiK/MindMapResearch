DecidingToBeBetter,fll2j0a,t3_fpbt0j,1585252413.0,"You can do it! It's very normal to have off days, but try your best to not stay there. While there isn't much physically social when we can do right now, there are many things within our surroundings. It's all about adjustments and taking it one day at a time. There are many self-care lists on Pinterest that help me a lot. I also like play upbeat music throughout the day, helps keep my mood up. :-D"
raisedbynarcissists,fll21sn,t1_flj5a0t,1585252163.0,"Yes, I know the feeling! One of my big triggers that I've been dealing with is cleaning and organizing. I grew up in a filthy hoarded home. When I was young, I wanted to clean and organize, but I would get yelled at for asking. On the other hand, my mother would yell at us for not helping and get furious so it was a vicious cycle. So now when I try to organize things and cleaning in general, I get a certain level of anger in me. Cleaning/organizing should be something very therapeutic, but for me, it makes me angry. I'm working through it, though."

mentalillness,fl49143,t3_fmbe8j,1584808551.0,"This bothers me because one of the things you do when you have been diagnosed is research and be knowledgeable of it. There are way too many judgmental people in this world especially in professional/educational settings that just don't understand. ""Oh they have disorders?"" Well, this is what I'm going to think about it. It's just ridiculous."
ptsd,fl480vi,t3_fmgms4,1584807933.0,"Ask about virtual options with your therapists, like said before.  My therapist is doing over-the-phone sessions. If your therapist doesn't provide that, there are toll-free numbers for crisis and other things.

&#x200B;

What's helping me in the meantime is: distractions like movies, music, TV, reading books. Keeping in contact with safe people in crucial, like your friends. I've been doing online or APP games like coloring and puzzles that I've found very therapeutic. Also breathing helps, too like said before."
raisedbynarcissists,fl47gq3,t3_fmekv9,1584807589.0,"YES! Also I tend to have opposite issues, too. I was chronically ignored so sometimes I get triggered when I don't get any notification.

Well considering the times I wanted this life to end, no, I don't NEED to love them like it's an obligation. I also hate when people use these certain phrases like excuses for any action that they have been done or currently do. Just because someone else hasn't experienced it doesn't mean they have the right to downplay or disregard/invalidate what happened to the victim. I've been a victim of that many, many times and it's heartbreaking."

ptsd,fkvaleo,t3_fko9ky,1584565360.0,"No, you're not stupid. I went through a massive amount of chronic traumatic events when I was very young (some of the worst of it I didn't know about until last year). When I entered school, I struggled A LOT. I couldn't focus, read, or speak well at all. I even had specialists who tried to ""figure me out"". I failed a grade in elementary school. I struggled through out until the end even during my college days. What it was all along was because of all of those traumatic events, my brain couldn't focus much on anything else outside of that. There is such a thing I call the ""mental/trauma fog"" where the triggers and trauma are your focus, not anything else. So please, please, please do NOT think you're stupid. Your brain is dealing with a LOT of stress and is trying to figure out how to handle it and so is your body. Please be aware of your bodily responses, too, such as nausea and migraines."

Thank you for your validation.

It's been almost a year since my discovery of everything. It's going to be a process and journey. It's still hard, but not as hard as it used to be. Hopefully with time, things will be easier."

raisedbynarcissists,fkp7j7c,t3_fjma0h,1584403568.0,"Yes, this is one of the most hardest things I've been struggling with. Just last year I've found out some heart-breaking information about my whole childhood that left me in pieces. The few loved ones and therapist that know my situation tell me ""live in the present, you cannot change your past"" among many very supportive and comforting things. I completely understand that, I wish it were easier said than done. It's just so hard to process that my whole childhood (up to 18, in reality up to now) and so many different areas of my life have been stolen from me. It's like a trauma life crisis. So many things could have been prevented, but there are very selfish and devious choices made that ruined my life. What's even worse is that every person involved has gas-lighted me and invalidated my entire life saying it was perfect and normal and that I was crazy. While I have my loved ones and a great therapist helping me through this, I feel alone in the processing of this shit. I wish so many things were different. I wish there was a time machine, and I could rescue me as a baby and take me to safety and into loving arms of someone else and give me a chance that I never had. It's so extremely hard to process this.....so fucking hard."

AnxietyDepression,fkodv7g,t1_fkodfqd,1584385243.0,I will agree with you. I tend to hide my emotions sometimes because I feel it's easier for me to deal with it internally and discuss with my friends or my counselor than tell him about every little thing. I've always been to myself with certain things because I had to survive that way. I feel it's much harder for partners who've had normal backgrounds with no illness to understand or connect with partners with this going on.
AnxietyDepression,fkocrm0,t3_fjktpb,1584384614.0,"I've deal with the same stuff, too. Unless the partner or loved one hasn't experienced it him/herself, it's hard for them to fully understand depression's deep depth it can have on people. I have C-PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and some things are just hard for me to comprehend emotionally. My loved one is like ""you're making it way over-complicated than it has to be."" He gets himself upset because I'm feeling well (which doesn't help one bit). He's definitely a more logical thinker than emotional one. The issue for me is: I know there are many, many things I can do like you said in your post, but it's the motivation to do it. I have those thoughts ""It doesn't matter so why bother?"" Depression is one HELL of a beast, and it itself prevents others with that motivation to do things. It's not like we don't want to get better, but our depression is saying ""you're staying right where you're at, you're under my grasp""."
depression,fko15t2,t3_fj8mva,1584378059.0,"Oh yes, I’ve learned to name my anxiety and depression so it feels like it’s not “me”. Mine is named “Arlene” It is the illness fucking with us. Just remember to try and let those thoughts come and go and focus on the happiness and present moments in your life."
depression,fkmixoc,t3_fj8mva,1584330190.0,"Yes, I have been there many, many times throughout my life. I could be with friends and in a room full of laughter then all of a sudden my brain shifts and the darkness hits. Depression and anxiety are strong forces of beasts when it comes to relationships with people. I've always had the high desire to have strong connections with others, but I feared the hurt and abandonment that I have suffered in my past from those closest (family). With depression it just comes with the territory. Hopefully with time you will find others who understand the illness and be there and know the signs. I've learned that even after many years of bettering myself, I still need reassurance from loved ones, ""are we okay?"" ""is our relationship good?"" I'm like you, I'm the ""clown"" of the group, and it can feel like it's torture on the inside because you don't want others to feel the same suffering you do. You got to learn to sit with the feeling of ""I can be vulnerable with my loved ones, and I don't have to hide beyond my clown mask all the time"". I've been there, and you're not alone!"

raisedbynarcissists,fklrs7p,t3_fisl9r,1584313164.0,"Yes, yes, yes! I dealt with this, too. It's almost the mindset of ""you're no longer in my house, now I can act like I like you.""
