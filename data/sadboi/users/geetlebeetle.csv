>1. Is 415cp enough? Will people not group with me because of that?
-Your CP is fine, but there will be people who may choose not to group with you, just as there are similar personalities who kick low cp from dungeons. You're better off running with guildies or friends who are more patient and helpful. 
>2. Should I do it on my DK Tank to make it easier or are tanks not needed.
-You absolutely need a tank, especially for the final boss, final round. 
>3. Can i bring a cp170 stamblade friend with me.
-Yes, but the higher DPS the better.
>4. PUG? Or guildies?
-Absolutely run with guildies, especially if you can find someone who has done it before and can take the lead/explain mechanics, etc. VDSA is a whole hell of a lot easier with decent, patient people who are willing to teach as opposed to craglorn pug trash."
