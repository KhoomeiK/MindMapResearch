AskGaybrosOver30,fahm5u5,t1_fah2fsa,1576088724.0,"What's curious is that the common response to ""hey, the gay community has issues"" is to 1) ignore them, 2) deny their existence, 3) make some claim about how straight people do xyz too (ignoring issues of frequency/proportion, of course), 4) silently downvoting, 5) flat out attacking the person observing them.

The flippant racism, for example. Anyone who's been to a gayborhood or used an app understands there's a clear racial hierarchy. Is this 1) okay, 2) not okay, 3) imagined? And if #3, why are so many people collectively noticing it?  Is noticing and rebuking it ""internalized homophobia?"" (Are we intrinsically racist?)

My theory is people contribute to it and don't enjoy the whistleblowing, so I have a strong stomach for all the abuse, but I figured over-30 was a good crowd where to get feedback.

AskGaybrosOver30,fah6cf9,t3_e987zk,1576080144.0,"So this seems like a reference to my post, and a few comments elaborated as I should have done originally. 

The gay community is the people. And it's where the people are and what they do collectively. If you want to find gay people, you go to a bar or open and app and there you go. I'm very happy there's a gay kickball league somewhere but that's not the median experience by any stretch.

What do you find in those venues? What ideals are expressed? What behaviors go on, and are tolerated? Are these positive or negative?

If you were advertising a product to gay men, what would you advertise? (hint: check your facebook/IG ads, mine are mostly skin cream and workouts and I've never googled for that). There are people who have figured us out.

And these issues manifest in disproportionately high rates of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, self-harm, body image issues, etc.  The convenient scapegoat is minority stress/oppression.

I don't understand the level of denial about the endemic problems - granted, a community of men with the commonality of sexual orientation, it's not terribly surprising - but we have some bad PR. And normalize things that probably ought not to be, even if ""harmless fun"" still directly and indirectly damaging or limiting in a lot of ways.

Dismissing interactions as ""seeking them"" or ""internalized homophobia"" (implying behaving this way is somehow intrinsic of being gay or denying something about oneself) is not helpful."
