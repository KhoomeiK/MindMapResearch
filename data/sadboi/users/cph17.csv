Anxiety,fm07jss,t3_frslfn,1585647824.0,"Thank you so much for putting this out there. I feel the exact same way and I have had two emotional breakdowns this week because I couldn’t logically think myself out of believing I EFFED up but I didn’t! 

I’m from the states, since the shelter in place - it feels I am out of practice on how to be friends with my own friends. it’s a weird feeling but here it is."
Anxiety,fl6tvcy,t3_fmvw91,1584883207.0,"I’m having so much anxiety that my mom or dad could have the virus but not know it because of the incubation period. I’m fearful that if they do have it, I won’t be able to see them due to quarantine, and then they possibly die. Someone help me. I’m up at 5am now due to this stress ):"
