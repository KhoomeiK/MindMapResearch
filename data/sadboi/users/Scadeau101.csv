LifeAfterNarcissism,fr390fj,t3_gm7iyl,1589852390.0,Wow she is horrible. And your dad not seeing a problem with her actions makes me sick. These are the type of people who should be banned from having kids.  Nmom and Ndad are sheep in wolves clothing.
sex,fqzy5ur,t3_glmgt8,1589778394.0,Wow that is intense.  It sounds like he was so nervous that he became super nauseous and was very embarrassed he couldn't do it so he didn't want to see you again as he feels like he is a major disappointment to you.
RelationshipAdviceNow,fqzka4g,t3_glpnc1,1589769179.0,Well at least you found out you still want to be with her. I say go for it

DeadBedrooms,fqxy6mp,t3_gla067,1589739640.0,They always say that the truth comes out when someone is either drunk or angry. She clearly feels that way. She didn't even apologise.  Divorce her. Clearly doesn't care nor  have any respect for you.
relationship_advice,fqxwm5r,t1_fqxokpb,1589738972.0,Wow I think you need to divorce your wife. She sounds so incredibly heartless
relationship_advice,fqxw09c,t1_fqxt097,1589738716.0,Well the wife had a kid so she has to deal with the actions of her underage daughter too
relationship_advice,fqxvggv,t1_fqxlubb,1589738486.0,My mom says the same. She says how she's nowhere in life cause she had kids..its really awful blaming your kids for being born when you were too irresponsible and dumb when you got pregnant
relationship_advice,fqxv5fp,t3_glgmr4,1589738366.0,Divorce your wife and provide shelter and live with your daughter.
datingoverthirty,fqx6sk4,t1_fqwhbo2,1589727064.0,Same.  As a child I've been abused by all the men in my family so I guess I've grown a fear of them
datingoverthirty,fqx5x33,t1_fqvoky4,1589726523.0,So true. Hookup culture has taken over
datingoverthirty,fqx3yj2,t3_gl6p39,1589725255.0,"Probably because people 30 and up are very emotionally mature and know what they want so they refuse to settle with just anybody. 

I cut people off so fast. One red flag and that's it."

RelationshipAdviceNow,fqr67mt,t1_fqr0xxd,1589578350.0,Yeah he definitely expects it now.  Tell him that he needs a job and that you can't afford to buy him anymore if it's not a special occasion. See how he reacts.
offmychest,fqpgxe4,t1_fqp983n,1589546121.0,Nothing was mentioned about kids. Don't go falsely assuming crap about why she was suicidal either. Also I would not recommend any mentally ill person struggling with things to have kids. Do you want the kid to suffer as well?
RelationshipAdviceNow,fqpf41f,t3_gk5ei1,1589544746.0,"I don't understand this. Stop buying him gifts. You're literally wasting your money and being an open book he can take advantage of. I definitely do think he is taking advantage of you. This is why you don't spoil kids because once they are so used to getting their way, they don't know how to do for themselves and go nuts when things don't  go their way. Quit giving him any gifts. Doesn't matter what it is. You shouldn't be giving him anything if it's not his birthday or a Holliday."
emotionalneglect,fqls7y3,t3_gjcsn2,1589465077.0,Wow I feel the exact same way and am in the same boat.

Majority of these men will ghost you and not talk to you if they don't get to have sex without strings attached with you. I hate the dating world now. It's just so awful. I got blocked by just explaining why I was depressed to a dude who asked on the dating app. Can't trust anyone today.
depression,fpnql1d,t1_fpnqau8,1588770396.0,Exactly. It's not fair. There's a damn virus around. What if we're sick or have to care for someone who is sick. These professors don't care man :/
depression,fpnq7yd,t3_gej9t3,1588770151.0,I understand you man. I just missed a second part of a final that he had closed in the fucking afternoon (yes didn't even give us a whole day) didn't fucking tell us about and I emailed him Sunday asking if there's anything else I need to know or do. No response. Now my grade has dropped from an A to a C and I've called him and everything.  Can't get in contact with him. This is such bullshit.
