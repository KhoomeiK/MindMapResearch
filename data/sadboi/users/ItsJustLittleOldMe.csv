HumansBeingBros,foesdpz,t3_g715np,1587713126.0,"Window visits are becoming a thing here in the US, but not with an open window. Here it's usually closed for protection and they use phones to talk to each other. 

Some places do video calls, but that only works when the recipient is tech savvy enough. My dad didn't see my mom for over a month because he's got a flip phone and doesn't do video conferencing. (She had a stroke that landed her in the hospital, and then rehab place.)"
Anxiety,foedsgr,t1_foe78aa,1587701367.0,"Aww, I appreciate your thought out response.

I feel bad. Didn't mean to misdirect you. I'm not actually worrying about Covid at the moment. Totally different symptom. I just don't think we're supposed to talk about symptoms here. 

I have a general doctor appointment next week which was rescheduled from earlier. It's just a 6 month well-visit, but I am due for bloodwork, which another doctor needs for a televisit following up on other lab tests. My doc office does blood draw right there, so I think I will be brave and go in. They're only doing well visits, and it's apparently not crowded and they take you right into the exam room.

I could do a tele-visit, but what's the point if I need to get bloodwork too? You see, I figure, knowing how my anxiety works, if I **don't** physically get examined, I will start second guessing the next time I have some other random symptom. (*I can hear myself saying ""Yea, but maybe there* ***is*** *something wrong, after all the doctor didn't take all my vitals!""*)

I'm angry because I would have had this visit taken care of in February, but when I arrived, they had screwed up and forgot to tell me the doc was on vacation. So it was moved to March, then I rescheduled in March for April.

Granted I haven't left my apartment in over a month, and I know agoraphobia is setting in, but I talked it over with a friend who's had anxiety and now works on an ambulance squad, and she thinks it's not risky to go. She reminded me that you should not avoid the doctor for things you're supposed to deal with, and also noted that the office is very empty now, etc...

Anyway, I'm rambling on. If you want to chat about more details, you can chat or PM me. 

Gotta get off reddit soon for tonight."

Being able to discern when to ignore something and when to pay attention was difficult enough *before* the global pandemic.

All Goodwill ny/nj stores and donation centers are closed until further notice.

Salvation Army wants you to store your goods and clothing donations at this time. They are accepting non perishable food, baby supplies, hygiene and cleaning supplies and paper products. 

I think all these kinds of places are accepting monetary donations now. 

One of the veterans places that normally picks up donations is also closed. We had a pickup scheduled for March 16, but it was canceled understandably. (Can't remember their name)
