Nurse,fle5e0w,t3_flbkgo,1585077910.0,I am a geriatric nurse and I hate to tell you but this is how it is at any home that you go to. It sucks that you always feel rushed BUT once you get a routine and get into your groove you WILL have more time and you WILL get to bond with your residents more. It will get better I promise. Geriatrics is very near and dear to me as well. I can't imagine doing anything different. As a new nurse it was very difficult for me as well but it does get better and you will get your groove and have more time to spend with your residents. Hang in there!!
Nurse,fle51af,t3_flskzl,1585077722.0,So I am a nurse in a nursing home. I am confused. They are telling you to just give a sponge bath? I am gonna be honest...I would never let my CNAs do that. I tell them to give them a shower because that is what we would want if we were home. They are human beings too and they deserve the respect that we would give anyone else. They deserve the dignity of a shower to keep clean and keep their skin integrity.
Nurse,fle4lgu,t3_flnat6,1585077487.0,My dad told me to quit being a nurse because it is dangerous and that I shouldn't be around my 3 year old daughter because of it.

AskReddit,f9r4xyl,t3_e6hjcy,1575571316.0,When my ex husband left me who I had been with for 14 years since we were 15 I spiraled out of control. We had a 2 year old daughter at the time. I don't even remember half of the year which is absolutely terrifying to me. I lost 45 pounds. I stopped eating. Then the worst thing that I regret more than anything is that I slept with like 15 men to try to cover up my pain and distract myself and make myself feel loved and wanted. I started drinking alot (I never drank when having my daughter).I cut myself to just feel something. I just wanted to feel something...anything. I did not care if I lived or died. I found out my husband cheated on me and left me for the woman and was going to marry her. He told my daughter to call her mom and that I am a loser.  Finally the breaking point for me was when I took a 1mg Xanax and consumed 2 bottles of vodka trying to kill myself. Fortunately I did not die. Fortunately I had a good friend that then took me to a mental health facility and I got the help I needed so desperately. Come to find out that I am bipolar and have major depressive disorder and was extremely manic at the time of sleeping with all of those men. That was the lowest and most embarrassing point in my life and I swear I will never be like that again. I will be strong for my daughter because she deserves to have her mother.
