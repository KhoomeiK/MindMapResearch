DUMB COMMENTS EDIT: There’s a movie called *As Good As It Gets* starring Jack Nicholson where he writes books from the viewpoint of a woman and when he gets asked how he writes women so well he says, “I think of a man, then I take away reason and accountability.” That line will stand the test of time.
