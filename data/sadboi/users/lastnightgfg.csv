LegendsOfRuneterra,fqx1c3h,t1_fqwt6di,1589723444.0,For me they should have move it a little closer to the card history or atleast right in the middle of the nexus so when you press it the nexus health is not completely blocked with your finger....
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqwd5wf,t1_fqw7kbh,1589700237.0,I'm trying to say is they have to move the eye a little closer to the history bar.
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqwckku,t1_fqw7vlq,1589699661.0,Tell it to them then...
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqwcgwf,t1_fqw7xds,1589699564.0,"Nah... If you use it, your finger is covering your nexus. So if you want to see the damage dealt to your nexus all you can do is tilt your phone in an awkward way..."

LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw6e7n,t1_fqw630x,1589694165.0,Or is that before or after any of you place a card tho?

LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw5j0s,t1_fqw58i7,1589693451.0,Well that's what i am expecting... I just hope that's what it is... Because it's kind of annoying thinking you could've just earn an LP if they chose to play.
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw5cym,t1_fqw4xmk,1589693315.0,Because if it is less it's better not to play then if their champion is annoying or just strong in the meta...
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw5462,t1_fqw4qof,1589693116.0,But do they lose points tho if they surrender from the start?  And if they do is it less or the same if you play? Because that means that if i find champions who counter most of my decks or are just strong in the meta then it's completely useless to chose to play.
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw4xmk,t1_fqw4nc1,1589692966.0,Oh so they still losses points? Is that the same if you play or less?
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw4vvv,t1_fqw4o5e,1589692927.0,But do they lose LP tho?
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw4tut,t1_fqw4oyz,1589692880.0,But do they lose LP tho if the surrender right away?
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw4r8y,t1_fqw4fcw,1589692822.0,"I think no, i mean LP... Because whenever i play, after the surrender animation the screen just goes straight reward points..."
LegendsOfRuneterra,fqw4hck,t1_fqw44w5,1589692601.0,But if you surrender right from the start (as i have never done that) do you lose points? I just feel like the other player should still have a points right? Because it's not his fault if he chose to play that deck. I play Karma-Lux btw and i hated burn too.
boyslove,fqvn3za,t1_fqugnet,1589680779.0,They never felt like in a real relationship tbh. Sarawat still stand-offish just like Bright irl. Insert squidward eye twitching meme- which is tge only emotion he does in the series...
boyslove,fqvmvd7,t1_fqvg0yw,1589680636.0,"It is so flat my pancake is ashamed. It has always been. From the moment they've been ""2gether"". Sarawat fails to make me believe that he likes Tine because even after they've become ""boyfriends"". He still acts cold and stand-offish like he is irl. I was hoping to see Bright show emotion in the series but he failed. I have never seen him do more emotion other then that ""squidward-eye-twitching-meme"" which he always does in everything, be it confused, sad, annoyed, angry. I like Win tho.. at the end of the series i see a potential in his acting.... This series is just so overhyped tbh."
boyslove,fqc3oqz,t1_fqbuowb,1589249465.0,BL is far from realistic... Especially when you realize that every characters around the main role has a huge tendency to be gay... It's from another dimension where everyone is gay...
boyslove,fqc39bs,t1_fqb5cpj,1589249212.0,"""obsessive gay man"" 
you know what's another problem with most BL? They dont even recognize the word ""gay"" as part of their character... Like ""ok I'm in love with you Bro but no homo"" ""I wanted to kiss you bro but no homo"" that kind of shit. And another thing (btw i like win metawin) i hate the fact that most of these supposed gay character just use women like straight guys do... Gays treat women better than straight men does... I mean there are gay men who uses women as a ""beard"" but usually that happens because they want to be what society views men to be but not to puposefully hurt women... You know that scene when Tines friend invited some girl to go to Tines room to study and Tine just ghosted her? There are a lot of problems about BL Genre and this series has a lot of it despite the fact that they label it as ""feel good series"" ""cutesy"". Also this series is just so overrated AF... Btw I don't like Bright, his character and the actor. From the series he doesn't show a lot of emotions other than being cold. I get it, like what ""Desperate Sarawat Wives"" would always tell me... He's supposed to be cold because that's his character in the novel. But come on... Even squid ward can display effective emotion other than eye twitching... I love, love, love Tine but sorry not sorry... You can barely feel they're boyfriends even after they both move in..."

boyslove,fpznkbm,t1_fpz6k65,1589020857.0,"Insecure? Maybe from the book but that ""insecurity"" has not shown effectively in the series... Yeah that surely is an insecure person giving yourself a title ""tine chic magnet"" (i forgot the title people call him but something like that) i like win so much that even tho I don't like Bright I still watch the series.  But knowing how Win can actually pull off a lot of emotion, but the writer/director/producer or whatever is not using his full potential annoys me...."
boyslove,fpz2o3f,t1_fpyjvmp,1589012685.0,The build up is just poorly written to be honest... I couldn't even feel they're actually boyfriends... Lol... I mean Win's showed a lot of emotion in the series.. but Bright is a meh... All his emotions are just so dry AF...

But as far as I can tell it doesn't really affect anything other than a continuous light source... My idea would be to just make it into something like a tether where you could connect each other but it still works the same there is still one person who leads but  everyone has to flap maybe that way you use less light? And it will also enable other players to move just in a limited distance. Also the ability to reconnect in flight is useful especially if you have more friends.."

Thai BL is like a different dimension to me where everyone (by everone, i mean there are like atleast 10 gay couples in 1 series) is gay and accepted. I don't think, that would help normalize the gay romance. Because in the first place these stories, no matter how gay it is. It's not based on a realistic take. You can tell it's just feeding into the fantasy of straight women and gay men who like straight men. Heck, ""coming out"" isn't even a thing in Thai BL.

It's a shitty mindset inside the Gay Community but that is the thruth. There are gay men who are way good looking than any straight actors in BL but as a bias they would always look for straight men. That also is the reality in western movie culture... People in the LGBT community think, it's a win-win situation, where they can see straight hot men making out, as well as have the representation for the community.

And there's another one that is very obvious why do you think the struggles of ""coming out"" has never been brought out in any BL series?
