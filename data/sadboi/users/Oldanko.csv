You can't have full knowledge of a system which you are a part of. What you can do is to make assumptions, test them against the system and accept the ones that work well enough.

In computer science, there are problems that can't be described accurately with math, so algorithms based on assumptions and correction are used. Example of such an algorithm is a neural network which work by starting with a random assumption and then correcting parameters with every iteration.

Your brain is a biological neural network which solves the problem of life. The problem of life is incomprehensible because there are other such neural networks running around which you can't account for fully. And there are certain assumptions encoded in your brain before you are born, so assumptions are at the core of your being.

Turns out, you have to make implicit assumptions before you start learning anything about the world. You have to assume that the world is real, that you can can study it and that there are more and less accurate models of the world.

Religions contain assumptions that have been tested and selected under conditions of harsh selection for millennia. It would be unwise to reject them just because the conditions are much softer nowadays and some stories do not comply with our modern standards."

Most of them are wrong and will be eliminated from the gene pool. Some of them are correct and will get rewarded with high reproductive success.

You are a member of a lineage of 3 billion years of genetic assumptions that have been good enough to survive. 

People make cultural and moral assumptions about how to live, some live on, others die out. You are following in footsteps of those who survived, accepting their assumptions, some of which might still be wrong but operational enough, others get outdated and have to be replaced.

I only remember justifying the book of Genesis as a symbolic story. I was also seeing religion as an important social binding tool. But I was thrown off this path by circumstances, which I hate myself for.

I started to watch atheistic videos and read atheistic materials, and I became an edgy atheist. I liked how they used reason tm and logic tm to defend their points. And they mainly argued against fundamentalist, who are not that good at defending their positions. Logical refutations of fundamentalist views made me become more confident in my world view.

The turning point for me was my exposure to the ideas of Jordan Peterson. His lectures made me return to my early intuitions, that have suddenly found a strong voice for their confirmation.

Here is my world view now.

1. Religiousness is an evolved instinct. We have evolved under conditions of religious influence. Participation in religious behavior might yield psychological benefits.

2. Religions make adaptive behavior the will of God. Religions exist under environmental pressures. A religion may promote adaptive and maladaptive behaviors. Religions that promote adaptive behavior will be more stable and yield benefits to the host society. Religions promoting harmful behavior will tend to die out. After a while religion becomes a collection of adaptive beliefs promoted as a will of God.

3. Adaptive irrational beliefs. There are such behaviors humans engage in that have evolutionary benefits but do not have known rational explanations. Such behaviors are often promoted by irrational beliefs (god says so). Those behaviors can be rejected by refuting the irrational beliefs (there is no evidence for god), but done so at a cost of losing evolutionary fitness. It is hard to give a modern example of such a belief, because we don't know the rational explanation by definition. An ancient example would be a prohibition on pork among ancient Jews. Open-minded and rational approach would give you paracites (punishment from God, as far as the religious would be concerned)

4. Evolution is functionally similar to God. Evolution can be compared to a thinking process, where ordered, complex and uswful information is created and accumulated in a form of DNA, which is also a kind of language. This process gives rise to humanity. And since the nature of consciousness is ultimately unknowable, you can make an unfalsifiable claim that evolution is also conscious to strengthen your belief system. A conscious thinking process that creates humans? Sounds like God enough to me.

So these are my justifications for believing in God and following religion."

As far as I understand it, the Gnostics basically believe that matter is bad because it gets corrupted and decays, and there's a higher spiritual realm that is good and holy and incorruptible(which why would you think that? I guess gnostics were either very impressed with math or tried to cope with reality by escaping into their minds).

As I see it, corruption is not a bug, but a feature. You take matter, you try to build something with it, you learn in the process, you destroy the product of your labor to make a better one. You enrich your spiritual attainment and you increase the quality of your material possession. That's also what evolution does. DNA is basically an idea written in a molecule, a set of instructions for survival. The instruction set is being constantly revised and improved by random mutations(corruptions!) and selection.

It seems to me that the best way is to accept the pattern with mindfulness and willingly submit to it, becoming one whole with whatever results from it. And perhaps, it will turn out good.

In conclusion, I would propose that both homosexuality and homophobia have expressions which are generally beneficial and others that are generally harmful.

evolution,fof5niw,t3_g764gx,1587726890.0,"I've heard several hypothesis about adaptive benefits of homosexuality.

1. Gay uncle hypothesis. The more children there are in a family, the higher chance of the next boy to be gay. The benefit is that a gay sibling will give up his reproductive success and help out his sisters with raising kids, providing more resources for them.

2. Gay priest. The same principle of giving up personal reproductive success for others, but on a societal scale, benefiting a large group. So a man with feminine features of character and a desire for cock will feel guilty because of social pressures, become a monk or a priest or something. He's a part of a gathering of a large group of men like him, which is the reward, and he also gets to organize society by distribution of adaptive beliefs. (Basically what religion does, it takes evolutionary adaptive beliefs and declares them to be the will of God). Back in the old days priestly men would also mutilate themselves, which is an extreme example of the principle.

3. Gays in military. Serves to strengthen the bonds between soldiers, so that they are more likely to act in a selfless manner on a battlefield (thing Sparta).

As for a thing being natural, I would use a more specific description of whether a behavior is adaptive in a context of pre industrial society. Some expressions of it were integrated into a society and yielded benefits, others were punished by homophobia. So in that sense homosexuality is as ""natural"" as homophobia, both used to balance each other to achieve a stable social arrangement."

evolution,fo4li61,t1_fo4ihl7,1587506586.0,"Here is my worry. Our current technological level creates a mild environment. By allowing not-currently-bad mutations to survive we are becoming more dependant on the technologies. To maintain the technological level a society needs a high number of competent people. Currently, income level, and by correlation competence, negatively predicts fertility. So as we become more reliant on our technologies we might suddenly become incapable of maintaining them. 

A possible result would be that environment will tend to prefer more traditionalist/religious people who are more inclined to have children, might have less mutational load, might not be as reliant on technologies. So in case of a drop on living standards people will already be prepared and the meek will inherit the earth."

Anyone who is born will most likely reach the age of reproduction, so there are little requirements in terms of immune system. I guess, sexual selection could play a role in selecting for features that correlate with good health. Childhood allergies rates and childhood cancer rates are increasing, but that could be genetic or environmental.

Once you accept that consciousness is universal you don't need any evidence for god, you can only have explanations for different aspects of god. This acceptance is, however, a matter of faith. The experience of consciousness is a purely subjective one and can't be studied objectively. You can't create a test to check whether someone or something is conscious or only pretends to be.

Edit: To take it to the extreme, If I was the only consciousness out there, that still wouldn't disprove god. The distinction between I and the universe exists only in my mind and the boundary can be drawn wherever I choose. In the underlying reality we are still one conscious system. So the universe is at least as conscious as I am. And conscious universe is god. But I believe that I am conscious, you are, a cell is, society is, evolutionary process is, because their function is comparable to thinking and to function of human brain. I guess there are no evidence for that tho."

INTP,fnuy6tf,t3_g4147p,1587274347.0,"I (intp/24/m) used to be an atheist for a long time. Then I realized a few of points that make me more inclined to believe in God and religion.

1. Nature of the consciousness. By consciousness I mean the experience of presence in the ""Cogito, ergo sum"" sense. It seems to me likely that consciousness is a feature of the universe, like magnetism, making the universe in a sense conscious.
2. Religiousness is an evolutionary adaptation. Religions are selected by evolutionary pressures, adaptive religions live on, maladaptive religions die out. Successful religions take adaptive behavior and declare them to be the will of god. Humans can engage in adaptive behaviors they don't know the real reason for, but the behavior is remains useful. Let's say, way before the germ theory of disease Jews didn't eat pork because god told them not to. Really, they avoided pork because of parasites. A rational person comes around and says that god doesn't exist, therefore, eating pork is fine. Those who eat pork before knowing how to cook it properly will be likely to get parasites and be in a disadvantage. It seems likely to me that there are many such adaptive behavior still remaining that we lose by distancing ourselves from established religions.
3. Evolution is a form of thinking. DNA is a kind of language. DNA is a highly ordered and complex string of useful information. It contains instructions about how to survive under certain environment. Some bacteria can even exchange DNA, bacteria are literally talking to each other with DNA, giving each other tips. Evolution thinks in DNA. Evolution learns by mistakes. It's a very slow form of thinking compared to human thinking, but it delivers impressive results. If evolution could be conscious, since the universe is assumed to be conscious for the sake of the argument, the thinking, creative, conscious force is deserving of the status of god. 
4. Humans are made in the image of god. Evolution is a creative force that gives rise to humans. Evolution is a process of selecting genes that are fit for the environment. An organism contains information about environment it has evolved for. Organisms are made to reflect the environment = they are made in the image of the environment. 

For a religion to exist and remain useful it has to be adaptable. It has to be updated to reflect the new conditions of the environment. And in times of very dynamic changes like we are living in it needs thinking people the most. By falling away from religions we are harming ourselves by exposing ourselves to maladaptive behaviors, and also harming religions by living them in hands of fundamentalists, who are the least likely to make any useful reforms. The correct approach would be to try to understand religions and continue their traditions in humility."

evolution,fnhbu3o,t1_fnezhv7,1586959371.0,"I said from the beginning that I was a layman. And from me layman's perspective, I see different races, I find out that people cluster together into groups which largely correspond to the races, so I take that as a confirmation. If there is a larger shared variation than between group variation in genetic markers, that's an extra piece of information to keep in mind.

As far as bigotry goes, people high in ethnocentrism will always be sensitive to inter group differences with or without race. It doesn't mater if you call it clusters, populations,  And liberals will be tolerant of and friendly towards other peoples with or without race. 

And the giving up of races seems like a political stunt to turn arguments about policies into arguments about words.

evolution,fneyft7,t1_fner6yh,1586898148.0,"We used to have old fashioned ideas about species, doesn't mean that we have to give up the word species because our understanding has changed or because defivition of species is somewhat vague.

We used to have old fassioned ideas about race. We used to look at people and see different large groups. Cluster analysis has been done and refined our understanding. Doesn't mean we have to give up the term race, on the contrary, our intuitive races alligned with the resulting clusters pretty well.

The fact that the number of clusters may vary doesn't change that much. A higher number of clusters doesn't give you drastically different results, it only breaks an already established cluster into two.

evolution,fnev1ql,t1_fnc9efm,1586896351.0,"Here are my thoughts regarding this matter, tell me if it makes sense. When you are talking about genetic variance, do you mean different gene variants (markers? loci? i don't know the exact terminology) regardless of their function?

I would propose that gene variants can be different in functional significance. If several gene variants are present randomly in members of two groups that live under different environments, there would seems to be no preference of one variant over any others. So those variants would be likely to have very similar functional effects. 

If a certain gene variant is present frequently in one group and rarely in the other, it is likely that either both groups had the variant in common, but it was then selected against under conditions of environment of one of the groups, or it emerged as a random mutation in one of the groups and was preferred by the environment. That variant would be likely to have very high functional significance.

By that logic, variance between groups would tend to be more significant than that within groups. 

As for classification into races, which are surely not the same as subspecies, cluster analysis is enough to demonstrate the usefulness of classification. And it has been shown that humanity can be neatly divided into 3, 4, 5 or 6 groups, where every next number only breaks a preciously established cluster into two, proving the validity of the previous division (you can think of East Asians and Native Americans as one race or two separate races)."
