Advice,fldrubd,t1_flbbnjx,1585070477.0,"> By giving yourself a purpose, you now have a reason to suffer, making it more bearable. To suffer aimlessly, is a dreadfull, empty existance.

thats generally my motivation behind looking for a goal. and it stopped me dead in my tracks when i realized i dont have one. 

at times im motivated and think about learning a language or sometimes unconsciously recur to buying new stuff to use and find some sort of feeling of purpose. but i end up falling down the slippery slope of thinking that these goals too, dont have meaning. whether i speak another language or own a switch it wont change anything. 

ill look into voluntary work, ive been relying on donating money which feels good at first but it has a limit. ill also keep in mind to accept that life indeed has no meaning. maybe that mentality will help me more than thinking that lifes meaning is hidden under a rock im yet to turn. 

to see the same mentality in 2 completely different lights is hard. either everything is meaningless why try, or everything is meaningless so why not. but in both i have a feeling of staying in the same situation as before. im doing it just cus i can. i have no purpose. i dont have a reason to withstand pain on the daily. 

thank you for your advice though. ill keep it all in mind."

Cold showers or meditating. My mind is too loud and I'm not patient too meditate. So I shower w such cold water that I can't think other than abt how it feels. It's a great feeling once the shower is done and u feel quiet. 
If u ever need support msg me. Best of luck I honestly do believe u can get through this. Don't give up on those things u love

Even so consider that many things are extremely pointless but also good to enjoy. Idk what hobbies u have but damn would I not want to live in a world without art. Sure it's pointless but I would die for it to live on forever.

On the outperformed thing, same. Im 20 I'm not even in college. I'm working a not even minimum wage job 40+hrs per week and u can imagine where my skill levels are at. W anything. That's fine. Whatever. I can still enjoy doing shitty songs drawings and reading books I'll never write.

Don't think too deeply into it. Don't take life so seriously. If things are pointless dony give them ur time of day. Just do what u enjoy.

I would highly recomend the usual as therapy and Excersise. I'm sure ure not an idiot and have heard those before but those have kept me alive for longer (not only that but made me genuinely feel better) - also not the gym if u don't like it I HATE it.

Listen. Firstly don't you dare equate your value to having or not friends and a girlfriend. Cus then everytime people don't wanna be with you you'll consider urself to be the worst being in existence.. That's not the case. You are worthy of friendship and all its just hard tbh.
If someone doesnt have opinions or thoughts or passions its hard to bond. You become a question mark instead of a person because people don't know how you think so becoming emotionally evolved is hard. 
I'm really proud of you for trying so hard. It's hard but ure already doing rlly well. I'm in a similar situation and I'm still terrified of dates.
So you clicked w someone but eventually they changed ur mind fine. They aren't worthy if they aren't interested. It's just a way to filter people. Keep trying. Or don't! And just work on being happy. Alone. And people will come. Work on being happy outside.
I just started judo and Im finally realizing friendships start by being first in a situation that facilitates conversation like on a one on one which is less intimidating than on a group setting. On a one on one simple silly questions like - how long have you been doing judo? How old are you? Have you seen that new news about x? Do you watch any series or read any books cus I found this rlly good one u have to read! 
 if u feel these are forced then yes. That's the point. We aren't smooth ppl so we might as well work with what we got. Make it forced make it awkward but MAKE it. Better to make mistakes like anyone else than not talk and become a doll.
Pro tip talking about what u like will get u excited and hyped and ull feel more comfortable. If people judge u you gotta learn to not give a fuck. Get into that punk energy and be free to do your own thing. Ull feel better. Best of luck"

I'm pretty sure he's aware how it impacts the ppl around him but to feel the need to change he needs to consider it a problem for himself. 
Also keep in mind change big enough to make a difference appear after months and sometimes years. So advice him, and let the thought cultivate and hope for the best. 

Also if u worry about him doing smthing to your friend I wish I could say contact the police but I think they won't act unless smthing happens first. So just be extra careful for some time."
