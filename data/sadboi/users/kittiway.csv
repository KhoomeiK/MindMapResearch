SuicideWatch,evc75sx,t3_cj0tqt,1564408153.0,"Please call your mom. My son son tried to slit his throat open 2 days ago. A machete, then a razor. Stitches, blood, 15 guns pointed at him because his girlfriend called police and they thought it was a domestic. It's such a jumbled up mess in my mind. He woke me up asking for a ride home. That's what I arrived to.
So grateful he's breathing and I know where he is. Please don't make them suffer. I too don't want to go on but I must for him. It would destroy him. I don't judge or condemn, I've been dealing with this for 10 years with him. It's an exhausting battle but there is hope, love and victory. Even small ones matter. You are loved"
