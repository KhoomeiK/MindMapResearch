I also tend to differentiate between the two. I have my favourite straight couples too...spoiler alert, none of them have Alexis in it.

I think what's nice is most of the gay couples that exist in media are depicted as very loving...even if the people themselves are stereotypes or meet an untimely demise, which is its own set of problems.

Also, Moira and her fucking wigs kill me.

Also, David is incredibly relateable to me as a neurotic person with trust issues attracted to multiple genders.

The worst fans I find are the ones who think they're smart for yelling quotes every few minutes, and idealize Rick. I find that the latter problem tends to be prevalent with the fans of media with asshole males as a main protagonist, like with Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and Bojack Horseman to a lesser degree. All of these shows however actively tell you not to be these characters. Hell, at the end of the Pickle Rick episode, a therapist calls Rick out on his shit behaviour and tells him that just because he can bend space-time doesn't mean he is excused from routinely work on himself. 

A lot of people however take the wrong message from the show, and a bunch of horrible people see it as defending their own crappy behaviour because they think they're acting like a ridiculously intelligent, rich, or interesting character when they're acting like a total asshole. It honestly saddens me how far the reputation of Rick and Morty has fallen because of these people."

Of the ones I still have on facebook, the South Asian Muslim girls I knew either became really hardcore with age or in the case of the friend I still talk to regularly, she straight up left, but still feel a lot of religious guilt.
