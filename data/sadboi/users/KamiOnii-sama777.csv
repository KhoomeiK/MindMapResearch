Wether that be Porn Novels, Porn Comics, and etc. Too much of anything is a bad thing and if your will is really that weak should you really be using anything at all js = /

Also honestly OP it's just human biological nature. I wouldn't feel so bad about something you hardly can control that's completely new to you. It's honestly quite a big step that you realized ahead of time that something is different with your body. 

But now that you know practicing self control is all you can do. Make a mantra in your head, exercise, hell maybe masturbating before you hang out would definitely help, meditate or distract yourself by wanting to learn something new and interesting. 

Take control of your passion or hormone fueled libido and channel into something else 🙂. It's all up to you OP and I'm sure you'll be able to make it through your feelings that are only natural to have."

The game is starting to look like most of the fighters (Killers) are let's say Melee Mario at best and Melee Kirby at worst. With of course your good three Fox, Falco, Etc. And then maybe like 1 to 2 could kinda be up there but would still 90% of the time get stomped out by how good Fox and the rest are.

This leads to DbD getting stale and honestly kind of just not fun to play anymore and watch. I honestly haven't even touched Oni. I heard he's ehhh. But they've already nerfed? He hasn't even had time to truly be in the meta outside of ptb. No time to even shake anything up at his best. 

I understand they need new things out to keep player interest, but sometimes you gotta stop and let things cool a while y'know?  Idk maybe I'm the only one that feels this way, but I think they should approach Killers like how good fighting games approach there characters when it comes to balancing

Me and my ex gf just got off work at 12 or so after a relatively easy night shift and decided to chill at my place for a while to spend a bit of time with each other since we hadn't been able to see each other that entire week. We were just catching up about what we've been doing that week while cuddling on the couch in the living and listening to some music. She asked me if my brothers were going to be home anytime tonight? 

(I live with my two little brothers in a two bedroom apartment. who are around the same age as me.)

I remembered that luckily my brothers said they were going to stay over at our mom's place for the night to hang out with our other siblings to play video games. After I told her this she did the cutest giggle ever and I immediately started making out with her in the living room. In hindsight we should have just went into the room, but I guess because we hadn't seen each other in a while we just didn't give a damn. 

Side note: I have a incredibly high sex drive. So I can literally fuck for hours.

With that in mind we were most likely literally going to do it all night if it wasn't for my siblings. About two hours or so in I believe I had her legs over her head in a missionary position and she had her arms wrapped around my neck while I was pounding into her. 

I don't know how, but somehow my ears caught the sound of our front door unlocking. I leapt off the couch and out of her so fast even I surprised myself. I literally did a flying kick to the door just as it was about to open. It was my little brother and his best friend and luckily neither of them got hurt. My heart was racing though and my ex was getting dress really quickly and tossing my pants, etc over to me at the sametime. After we were dress my ex was really embarrassed and hiding under the blanket while my little brother was playing Long Sword Style on his phone loudly and laughing at me with his best friend. They left a few games that they really wanted to play with the kids, so that's why they were back so early. 

After getting the games and leaving. The mood was officially killed. So she decided to sleep over and leave in the morning. We had a good laugh about it though even though she was really embarrassed. To this day I will never here the end of how they almost caught me doing the dirty. XD"
