adderall,fqvfq0w,t3_gl14bz,1589676309.0,It’s normal to get hotter easier on stimulants. If your face is red you’re probably on the verge of breaking a sweat. Nothing to worry about

adderall,fqvfg0b,t3_gl42bq,1589676140.0,That happens to me with or without adderall. I can’t concentrate with background sound either way. I just get pissed more easily when I’m on adderall.

adderall,fqg28xe,t3_gidd1h,1589336431.0,How much sleep are you getting? Are you smoking or taking sleeping pills/downers before bed to help you sleep? Doing so can cause severe next-morning grogginess. Try to hydrate more before you go to bed and right when you wake up too.
adderall,fqg1kzv,t1_fqd6ity,1589336035.0,"About 8 months. Honestly it’s not as big of a deal as it sounds on this post the benefits outweigh the costs for sure, I was just frustrated. Frustration is the biggest thing with adderall for me. I need to take a break"
adderall,fpt2cok,t1_fpsq7ah,1588883652.0,That’s an exaggeration haha unless we’re talking 50mg of addy with 2 energy drinks
adderall,fpsqnjb,t3_gf8qzp,1588877965.0,"I think it was made this way to be more physically stimulating. The two types of salts in it are levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. Adderall is 25% l-amph and 75% d-amph. D-amph is the most potent amphetamine, but l-amph is more stimulating. It makes you more alert and energetic than d-amph."
adderall,fpsq4p7,t3_gf9xnx,1588877713.0,You’d be good to take it anytime. That’s not a very high dose and mixed with one energy drink it won’t be dangerous. People mix amphetamine and caffeine all the time
adderall,fpq6146,t3_getxlv,1588815875.0,Holy shit though I was the only one. I would describe it as feeling like your esophagus is trying to push upward for no reason. It only happens every once in a while for me but it’s hella annoying
adderall,fph3x1u,t3_gddz7h,1588614525.0,Probably dehydration/ high blood pressure. Try to drink more water
adderall,fp9te5i,t3_gc8dq9,1588434165.0,Yep I feel this if I’m not doing something my thoughts tend to turn toward myself and I feel like a piece of shit for not doing something with my day.
adderall,fp8fkpt,t1_fp7jc0d,1588391032.0,Haha true. So satisfying to get stuff done yet so frustrating to not have anything to do
adderall,foqqbne,t3_g8ogli,1587998878.0,"Maybe you’re just really sensitive and should try a non-amphetamine like ritalin, concerta, or even Wellbutrin. Might make a difference. If you can’t find a way but you need the medication to focus you could try taking a benzo with it, which may work but is also typically a bad idea because of how addictive taking both together could be."
adderall,fny6u4t,t3_g412ar,1587354849.0,"My experience with sleeping drugs is you will gain a tolerance to the point that they do not help anyways unfortunately. Benzos are sketchy to take every night because they stop working and you either have to up your dose-slippery slope, or just quit taking them-withdrawals and insomnia. I’ve taken tizanidine, baclofen, clonidine and remeron and they all worked pretty well at first but I built a tolerance and they became worthless. Many people with insomnia will tell you the same, that sleeping pills aren’t really worth it. Try taking your adderall earlier, getting more exercise during the day, and avoiding caffeine and sugar in the evening. Also take magnesium and melatonin an hour or two before bed. This is just my experience so take it with a grain of salt"
adderall,fndqd3d,t3_g137cn,1586875481.0,"This happens to me too. I think it depends on how much work you have to do that day and your stress level.

If I don’t have too much to do one then I’ll be a lot more relaxed and feeling better."
weed,fnca0u2,t3_g0l4i4,1586831871.0,"My best experience from weed involved this feeling. I was riding in a car and it was dark. I closed my eyes and leaned my head back and felt a really intense g-force pulling me down, which made it feel like I was going up. Like I was literally climbing. I felt like I was in an airplane performing a vertical take off. It was incredible. Until then I didn’t know weed could give you the sensation of flying"
adderall,fnc8isr,t3_g0rboh,1586830921.0,"Either try a lower dose or go on a tolerance break. If irritability is the problem, a higher dose would probably only make it worse"

adderall,fn83cz4,t1_fn7s9dh,1586733034.0,"Taking it after eating or drinking acids just weakens the effects. Amphetamine is better absorbed when your stomach has a low ph level, so the effects are stronger. Some people even take antacids before taking adderall to strengthen the effects"
adderall,fmt5ifx,t3_fx9dma,1586367190.0,"You might have to mess with your dose a little bit like the other person said. I can’t relate to this problem but try to find something to keep you busy, like a new hobby. When you start to get tired take a freezing cold shower. It shocks you awake it’s quite useful although unpleasant."
adderall,fmmawyl,t3_fvs3wa,1586201995.0,So taking less than your dose still results in the same effects for you?
adderall,fmma7z2,t3_fvu0gf,1586201641.0,"Same for me except I still like soda. However most desserts are disgusting to me. Cake and brownies are the worst. Ice cream and cookies are okay occasionally

adderall,fmgdfef,t3_fux4fo,1586046549.0,Either a blood pressure or blood sugar issue. The likely solution to either of these is eat more food and drink more water. A lot more. And don’t just eat shitty food eat some fruits and veggies also

I had the exact same problem: when reading, my mind is elsewhere and I don’t retain any information at all. Well not since I’ve started adderall. You’ll probably want to get a psychiatrist if you can because general physicians don’t usually prescribe drugs for mental disorders."
adderall,fji2fs8,t3_fdgr2w,1583359479.0,"You could probably take it at 2. For me it lasts about 5 hours before gradually wearing off. I never crash, it wears off slowly for me. The latest I take mine is 2:30 and then I can be tired enough to get to sleep by 11 or so. Taking vitamin c and magnesium a couple hours before bed can help you sleep too."
adderall,fj9q77l,t3_fc6c3c,1583156752.0,Drink tons of water. That eliminates the stim headaches  for me. If that doesn’t work take some ibuprofen also.
adderall,fj2p3t5,t1_fj2bghf,1582949641.0,You could try a higher dose but it might not make much difference if 30mg isn’t doing anything. There are some other options though. You could try ritalin/focalin or non stimulant adhd meds if adderall isn’t working
adderall,fj1ygs0,t3_faw8q3,1582930648.0,"It’s probably one of two things. Either you’re chasing the high, or adderall isn’t for you. 30mg xr is a fairly large dose for therapeutic effects and unless you’re a very large human being it should be enough to help with adhd. So it’s either not working in which case you should move on, or you’re wanting the high from it in which case you should definitely move on because that’s a bad road to go down"
adderall,fj1xur1,t1_fj113tb,1582930247.0,"Do you see a psychiatrist or just a physician? Your docs knowledge seems off. Snri’s generally have more side effects than ssri’s. General physicians don’t usually have much knowledge on most medications. Psychiatrists are the experts. If you don’t have a psych I’d look into getting one. 

You’re probably having more side effects just from starting the pristiq. Both pristiq and adderall increase norepinephrine, so that’s probably why you are having increased heartbeat/jitteriness. Norepinephrine is the “fight or flight” brain chemical."
adderall,fitnail,t3_f9rb1j,1582724853.0,I have very similar issues. Here’s what I do. Get some exercise during the day. If you can’t run or work out even just a 30 min walk in the evening/night can help a lot. Take magnesium glycinate and melatonin an hour or two before bed. If this doesn’t work you could try otc sleep meds like zzzquil. Hope this helps

adderall,ficjfl5,t3_f7l68m,1582349098.0,"First off 20mg vyvanse is a really low dose so there’s a lot of room to increase if it stops working well for you. In my experience developing a tolerance to amphetamine doesn’t make it any less effective for focus, it’s just less euphoric. I’ve been taking 20mg xr for 6 months now with no need to increase.

adderall,fhc94o5,t3_f2fjqs,1581458694.0,"It it’s a capsule than it’s adderall xr, meaning it releases two doses of 7.5mg at different times. 15mg xr=7.5mg ir, released twice. First dose is released shortly after taking the pill and the second dose will be released a few hours later. Keep this in mind because it will last nearly twice as long as a normal adderall would. I would just take it all at once because 15mg xr is a very small dose. For your first time it shouldn’t be too much. However beware that you will probably not be able to sleep for about 12 hours after taking it. 

Make sure to drink a lot of water and try to eat although you will have no appetite. It will help eliminate the comedown. Oh, and coffee is absolute shit compared to amphetamine. Have fun:)"
adderall,fhaw3fi,t3_f245ma,1581428660.0,"I’d talk to your doctor about trying adderall. It has another amphetamine in it, levoampheatmine, which increases your norepinephrine levels (basically adrenaline) which should keep you awake better."

adderall,fdi1v90,t3_ekpm73,1578434246.0,I think that’s common for people with severe adhd.

adderall,fdi1fv4,t3_el97de,1578434047.0,I used to vape with my adderall. I’d say it does make adderall stronger. It’s also more enjoyable and safe as far as I know.

adderall,fb98s2x,t3_ec10pg,1576632304.0,"I would consider taking adderall xr in the morning and then an ir booster in the afternoon. This would probably fit your time frame well so that you would be tired come nighttime but you wouldn’t have a bad crash. Adderall ir lasts 5-6 hours for me and xr lasts 9-10. I take 20mg xr at 7am every day and it wears off by 4 or 5. On days that I have a lot of homework I take 20mg ir at 3-4pm and it wears off nicely before bed. It seems like a better alternative than taking ir 3x daily. 

I think this would work better but I can’t guarantee there would be no crash. I just don’t experience crashes. Another good option would be vyvanse which I haven’t taken but I’ve heard it’s smoother than adderall and way longer lasting so you would only have to take one dose a day. Hope you find something that works"
