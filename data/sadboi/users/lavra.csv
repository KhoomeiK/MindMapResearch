If you don't think that quite applies to you, what about bouts of intense emotion including despair, rage, or even elation? Mastering grounding techniques could help you reign in and control those emotions, bring yourself back to ""the present"". The [54321 grounding technique](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/530782c6e4b05512e6e90a18/t/56d06ceb37013b97b19f7c21/1456499947764/54321+Grounding+Exercise.pdf) is especially effective. Remember to use lots of detail. Let me take a moment to explain the point of the exercise.

You're trying to interrupt an episode of extreme emotion, right? What's the opposite of that? Boredom, benignity, calm. So this exercise is kind of boring. What you do is to look around your surroundings, listen, feel yourself in the moment, notice yourself existing in space and time instead of in your head where all those emotions are. List things you see - but don't just list them, examine them - pick them up, explore their weight, texture, the color, shade, hue, shape of the shadows. You've owned that painting for 15 years? But have you ever counted how many shades of blue are in the water? That kind of thing. Sometimes people don't like it because it's boring, but it's so effective at bringing you out of that emotional moment. Try it sometime! Also, use it to fall asleep, for obvious reasons."

Basically, it really varies, but about 15-20% of the population is particularly emotional and empathetic, more sensitive to noise (not better hearing, just bothered more easily by loud or unpleasant sounds, that kind of thing), maybe even sensitive to things like texture and taste (for example, I hate the feel of rope and lots of carpet, that roughness bothers me more than others).

Drawing attention to the not-so-empowering mindset is surely good, but blaming the author for being affected by society in this way is counterproductive.  I'm just trying to say that because I've seen people get pretty harsh with internet comments and the author is obviously well-meaning and even acknowledged the criticism already and it seems like I came early so I don't want to come back here and see a lot of conflict where we could be supportive instead.

to be clear, my interpretation is this: this kind of self-deprecating humor is easily accepted in real-life conversations among friends and accepted more easily as a light-hearted joke, but in comic form, when shown to a wider audience, suddenly it has a message. Either way it represents a skewed understanding of harassment and self-worth, but as a comic it can be seen as promoting this mindset."
