depression,f7vkhg2,t1_f7vbxvq,1574024526.0,"The same thing happens for me. Sometimes forcing myself to do things that I used to like helps, working out definitely helps, or even just going and spending some time outside. It also helps that I work at a peer support center; the people who work and go there all have lived experience with mental health and understand things that someone off the street might now know anything about. And nobody will call the cops if you share what you're going through because it's too dark or serious."
