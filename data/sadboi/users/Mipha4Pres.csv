Ik its a battle with self esteem but you can't look at yourself as someone that he settled for.  You're a human being with your own life and personality and whoever doesn't love you for exactly who you are can go fuck themselves!  

Also, bringing up ex's in that manner is entirely inappropriate and it's much deeper than him being oblivious.  If he loved you he would boost your confidence not crumble it.  He would make you feel equal, not like he had to settle for you.  Even if you don't believe it, you ARE worth it.  You deserve to be loved and treated with respect.  He sounds like a child who has a lot of growing up to do.  

He isn't settling.  If anything, you are.  Being treated like that means you are settling for a life less than what you deserve."

Then those assumptions would lead to splitting and just regressing.  I haven't learned what is the right thing to do but recently I've decided that wearing the mask is much better than showing the world my face.   Life is just easier this way.

In my experience people only care about themselves so I'll make their vision of me whatever it needs to be to get them to shut up or get what I want.
