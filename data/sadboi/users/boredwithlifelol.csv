sad,fq59bp2,t3_gguqug,1589096888.0,"ha ha ha she literally is so mad at me for not making her a card like the ""other kids"". she even went out of her way to send me all the letters and show me all the posts of the kids saying happy mothers day to their parents. shes telling me. sorry not telling me. i mean forcing me to write her a mothers day card or she'll kick me out. wow. just wow."
SuicideWatch,foeufd2,t3_g717g3,1587715119.0,people like her dont deserve the love you gave her. but she will get her karma so please dont stoop down to her level and get revenge. but remember to everyone that comes in your life will be like that so please dont lose hope in loving again.
SuicideWatch,foeu7uo,t3_g6wuri,1587714914.0,i cant imagine what  you're going through and im so sorry you had to experience this when your daughter just came out of the womb. but please don't kill yourself you are very brave for still being here and planning your daughters funeral. i dont know if you are religious but when the time comes you will meet each other again even if its in heaven or in another life. i know right now you feel so lost and empty but stay strong not because anyone here and even myself is telling you but because im sure your daughter would want you to.
sad,foetvaq,t1_fodvse6,1587714575.0,"u/therenousername wow your ignorance is just incomparable to anything ive seen or heard. yes if i wanted to die i wouldve done it already and i have but i fucking survived. and ffs i wish i didnt. fuck man im so scared to do it over and over again. but i guess you dont get it because you think my problem isnt big enough to go on reddit and just say how i feel. people like you are the ones that encourage suicide and dont even fucking know it. sure you may have gone through some tough times as well and you should know how it feels. but instead you come here and say i took it the wrong way and i should stop complaining if it was most likely a joke. you come live my life and you tell me if it was a fucking joke when she tells you go fuck yourself and die.

u/SublimeNick thank you for understanding me. i just wanted to get if off my chest"

SuicideWatch,fnv4gsc,t1_fnuci4n,1587279930.0,im 17 and i actually am planning on living on a campus for university and im so glad because the university is so far the only way to get there is flying on a plane. but they're having second decisions because they dont trust me. why? because they think ill just go and kill myself
SuicideWatch,fmhjpcv,t1_fmhiew4,1586082991.0,ive already done that and it was so shit and useless and the thing is that i dont want my brother to be away from me because before he was born and i went through police and social works i felt so shit for doing it and my depression became worse and now i only have traumatic experiences from being in a different home.
SuicideWatch,fm412bw,t3_fsqi84,1585743659.0,i always joke around to my friends saying this and they take it as a joke when in reality im dead serious and dont want to stay in this hellhole any longer
