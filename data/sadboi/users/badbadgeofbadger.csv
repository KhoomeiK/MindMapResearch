relationship_advice,fqjlb1z,t3_gipd5h,1589411570.0,Realistically it is a no brainer. It's not like you entered the relationship being aware that this was his plan. It's not a career. It's not legal where you are. If he would rather sell drugs than start a legitimate side hustle then that would be a no from me lol
relationship_advice,fqfzu0i,t3_gipd5h,1589335007.0,Not a complete Karen. Just let him know that this isn't quite the lifestyle you envision for yourself and you feel like the risk outweighs the reward. If he doesn't respect that he doesn't respect you.

relationship_advice,fpudlw4,t3_gfloij,1588910317.0,"""I don't know how to deal with her anymore"" speaks volumes to me. That's your daughter. Try to understand that she is a human and whatever is hurting her is most likely an illness or disorder. Separate the depression from the person. Compassion goes a long way. Even if you don't understand how somebody feels validating their feelings is powerful. That doesn't mean feeding into it but just a simple acknowledgement etc. I'm not saying you haven't tried and arent trying. Just solely based off what you've said here I do worry that in between bouts of trying to be supportive you may have relayed your frustration and feelings of being tired of ""dealing with her"" to her. That's damaging and can be impossible for her to forget. Even among your other good intentions."
relationship_advice,fpud8jk,t3_gfloij,1588910066.0,"You have to understand and accept that she may never ""get better"". Theres a difference between being depressed and having depression. She may have a mental illness as opposed to be going through something. I noticed you mentioned you told her that everyone is scared to talk to her. That seems like it could be  a very hurtful thing to hear. Keep in mind you can be truthful without being hurtful. Theres a way to word things. People who are depressed often feel like a burden, unloved, unwanted etc. Often times they KNOW that their problems are too much for others and that is crippling and a very very isolating and heart breaking thing. As far as your perception of her and her niece, it's important to understand that just because you dont perceive something as being important doesn't mean that that's the way it is for everyone, or that she isn't entitled to feel the way she feels. If it's important to her, its important. It sounds like she feels she doesnt matter and has very little control or meaning in her life so small things like that can be really huge to somebody in that frame of mind. Honestly, if you really want to help talk to a professional. Theres books and meetings and professionals that can provide you with the guidance to learn how to be a source of support for your daughter. If that seems like it's too much for you I honestly worry that could be an indication of where her problems stem with to begin with. I've lost many people to suicide and struggle with mental health myself. Communication is so important and even just adjusting one or two words in a sentence when trying to relay how you feel can make the difference between hurting and helping. Theres resources out there. Find them."

And bipolar is not a type of person it's a type of disorder so everyone's experiences will vary. And if you broke up with somebody because you couldn't handle their mental illness symptoms that sucks but that's one thing. If you broke up with somebody because they ""hinted"" about having a disorder that's kind of shitty but either way they're better off without. Nobody chooses to be mentally ill and having a solid support system makes all the difference in the world."

BPD,fn0z7g7,t1_fn0ynfl,1586551625.0,"I know it's hard and I'm happy you're still alive. I've been in this situation before not with a fiance but I was upset and suicidal and ended up in the hospital and I asked my friend to tell the guy I had been seeing at the time that I was there. He said ""ok."" I was so mad for a  while but then I realized it wasnt his job to save me, or his job to console me, or fair that he had to go through the constant stress and cries for attention. And I felt pretty stupid. Like I said I don't know YOUR situation. But in my case, it's happened a few times, yes I was hurting deeply and that was serious. But I'd be lying if I said there wasnt a part of me (though I denied it even to myself) that wanted attention, wanted to prove a point, wanted to send a message, etc. And I had to come to terms with that and take responsibility for that. Yes your loved ones are supposed to be there for you, but the most important things is that they protect themselves and their energy. It's exhausting being on an emotional rollercoaster, and even worse if somebody feels like they're being manipulated. This doesnt mean your feelings aren't valid or that you weren't seriously trying to die. It just means that you can't expect others to react in a specific way to your actions. All the best truly.

It's understandable that you're upset regardless. Have you tried asking him about it? He may be willing to provide answers, if you'll hear them. But if I'm being honest it seems like he is over the situation. I think if he genuinely cared for you, and genuinely thought you could die, he would be concerned. His lack of concern shows he isn't taking it seriously, which could be for the best. Again I dont know the history so its hard to give rounded advice based on such a small glimpse into somebody's life."

That's a ME problem not a HIM problem, so I'd never voice it or accuse him of anything. It just means you're insecure and don't trust him.

Your children have nothing to do with your wife's sexual infidelities. Why on earth would you want to potentially destroy that relationship? I understand wanting custody, but for the love of god. Children need their parents. Planting seeds of hatred, betrayal, mistrust, and pain between a child and a parent? I am 24 years old. My mom and dad didn't divorce until I was just turning 15. My mother pinned me against my father my whole life, but at 15 she was quick to tell me my dad was cheating on ""us"" with a woman who had kids of her own. I used to be so close with my father my entire life, and it severed the relationship. Nearing 10 years later, it will never be the same. And the internal struggle that comes from two parents telling a child horrible things about the other? You must understand, your children are HALF of that woman. By telling them she is basically a bad person, or that she willingly chose to break up the family? That is basically telling them that half of them is broken. That they weren't good enough. I'm sure others will disagree with me, but CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE FORCED TO DEAL WITH ADULT ISSUES. Don't do this. When they are adults, and able to process and understand at a fully developed adult level- then maybe tell them. If they even want to know. Forcing your kids to pick a side for your own benefit is horrible. EVEN IF she isnt equipped to be a full time parent on her own, as children they will not understand. They will internalize it. Trust me. No child deserves to go through that emotional turmoil. The feelings of betrayal and hurt you feel? Don't put that onto your kids. Dont."

You dont have to date a smoker if you don't want to. But please remember that smoking in itself does not lower the value of a person. It doesn't make them morally corrupt, weak, unintelligent, etc. So if you have genuine triggers based around people smoking cigarettes you need to seek counseling.

It's understandable being uncomfortable, but it doesn't sound like you were in danger or at risk so while your feelings are valid, you can't expect other people who aren't you to agree with your feelings.

No means no, so if she doesn't want to speak with you anymore you have to respect that. And it's so important to say what you mean and mean what you say.
