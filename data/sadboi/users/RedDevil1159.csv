I dated a Libra until quite recently - our breakup was more to life circumstances. Our deal was - if one of us was bothered by something - send an email or write a letter/note to the other person.

My friends and the groups/organizations I'm affiliated with are important to me. I seem to always be the common denominator among making connections with friend groups. I am on track for reaching successful career ambitions. I work hard and play hard.

It is a struggle, of wanting to belong but also having that lone wolf vibe. I have to remember to put myself first and not sacrifice my health and happiness due to my ambition of relationships. To remember it's okay to not meet impossibly high expectations. Or that I cant solve everything. 

It is a weird house. Taking a chill pill and focusing on enjoying the present are both helpful. Sorry I don't have much else except that I feel you.

astrology,fo3dg3o,t3_g5hfjv,1587485007.0,"When I think of Moon signs in general, I think of emotions. Your moon sign represents your emotional tendencies and baseline. And, as you said, motivation is a raw emotion, that is correct. However, that means like, as any emotion - it waxes and wanes (also just like the moon itself). So if you're emotionally spent or overwhelmed, your motivation is probably going to have a hard time coming through. 

Here is what you need to re-think is the difference between discipline and motivation. I am a Capricorn Sun and Leo Moon. My Leo moon may have the motivation to go have fun and play, but my Capricorn Sun is so incredibly disciplined it can take over regardless of what my motivation is or isn't. 

Signs are not good or bad, they are tools and you need to harness them. Your Aries Moon can give you a lot of energy. Your Cancer Sun can probably respond well to direction and is perceptive in terms of what you are feeling and need. Utilize your Virgo Rising and set schedules, routines and habits for yourself. Every day you accomplish your goals/routines - reward yourself. Then get up and do it again the next day. Progress, not perfection."
