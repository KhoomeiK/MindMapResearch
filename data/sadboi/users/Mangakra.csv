If you guys are exes, then there’s nothing to hide anymore. You guys aren’t together. Being on good terms with your ex doesn’t mean it’s romantic anymore. You’ve moved on and got yourself another boyfriend or girlfriend, that shouldn’t concern your ex, you know?

But you have to buy it no matter what. If I want a soda or some juice, I’ll drink it while I’m shopping and then pay for it when i’m checking out. I’ve even finished food before making it to checkout, nothing wrong with scanning an empty bottle/wrapper and immediately trashing it.

A grocery store I used to shop at sold self-serving mochi. When checking out, the cashier asked me how many was there. I got 6, but I ate 2 while shopping and I told him that. He simply thanked me for my honesty and continued checking out.

They informed us that there was a person who found our dog and took her into their home because it was cold outside at the time, but took her to the animal hospital in the morning because they noticed she was wearing a collar.

If it wasn’t for her collar, I’m not 100% sure if my love would be with us right now.

A time I’ll never forget, I once got a call when I was 14 and I was home alone. There was a guy asking for some girl, and he told me that she used to “help him”. Confused, I said that he had the wrong number. Continuing, I heard shuffling and he said “do you know what kind of help?” 

I know I should have ended the call, but I didn’t want to be rude and so I let him continue. He tells me, “She helps me get off”.

It immediately clicked in my head so I let out a nervous laugh and told him “I’m sorry, I can’t help you like that I’m only 14.” 

He pauses for a second before he made strange noises and says, “Oh yeah? and says “Don’t worry, I’m only 22. What are you wearing right now?” 

I remember the fucking dread that just shot up in my body and I hurried up and hung up the phone. I felt extremely disgusted, and unfortunately that was not the first or last encounter I had when I was underaged. A man asking me on a date at that age WHILE holding his young daughter which freaked me out the most, another man inviting me into his car when I was walking to the store, etc.

I even helped out a high school girl who was being constantly followed and physically harassed by an older man. Thankfully, the police were called and he was arrested especially since he already had a warrant out for his arrest. I got the girls number and she still talks to me and thanks me every time I see her on that bus stop. It’s sad how there’s so many girls that feel too scared to speak out, as well. I don’t want to think about what would have happened to her if I hadn’t stepped in."
AskReddit,fpmw0xc,t3_gdn8w2,1588743247.0,"Deciding to have kids and not be in their life as well as screw them over.

My dad did this, But it’s not that he disappeared and we haven’t heard from him, no. I think i would have preferred that in the end; Not leaving our hometown with us, but calling us and making empty promises for 10 years. 

1. Promising he would send money and help us get out of a motel but instead stealing tax money for 10 years straight from my mom which led to us being on the street with a newborn baby in freezing temperatures.

2. Promising he would come live with us and help us, but he never did. I remember my dad told me he would when I was in middle school, and I got excited and told everyone I knew, and he never came. I didn’t go to school for a long time after that because I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and excruciatingly sad.

3. When my brother tried to rape me, my dad treated me like a victim which i hated, then suggested I go across the country to live with him to get away from the side of my family that actually cared about me. 

I stopped believing him, and started treating him like a stranger. I noticed my brothers grew very distant and cold from us and developed anger issues and depression problems and started arguing with our mom, and later revealed its because they both needed their dad in their life again.

It was like this until 2018, when our dad passed away from a mysterious and strange car accident which led him to have a heart attack when he had no other injuries. 

I hated that all my life I wanted to see him and be a family as a whole again, and that’s how I had to see him- 10 years later, in a fucking casket.

Learning that he stole tax money from my mom which could have helped us get out of a motel. Knowing that he wouldn’t see me graduate school, get married, have children, nothing. Knowing that he probably didn’t want to, and will never again have the chance to in my life.

if I knew that I would have kids, I would never put them through this. What a horrible, indescribable feeling for a child to not have two parents in their life, and one of them to not give a shit about you and screw you over.
