End of the pantry muffins

Churchmouse muffins

1 cup chopped fruit (raisins, apples, etc.)    
3/4 c. Brown sugar    
1 c. Water    
1 tsp baking soda    
1 tsp cinnamon    
1 tsp nutmeg    
1 1/2 c. Flour    

Mix all together and pour into greased muffin tins. Bake at 375 degrees for 18-20 minutes. 

This is a great recipe when you're low on pantry supplies, and you can jazz it up as much as you like. Sub milk for the water, maybe a little oil. My mom got this recipe from a friend who would make these back when their family was 'as poor as churchmice'"

Luckily she found out five days later the patient was negative. If they hadn’t been, she would’ve potentially exposed a lot of people in the time she didn’t know she could be contagious."

toxicparents,fhpyxeg,t1_fhpx5gv,1581797028.0,"So I kinda did “have to” because we would have really bad problems she would not handle and I would have to live with the consequences if I didn’t fix the problem. For instance, we had an ant infestation in the base of my window in my bedroom when I was in high school. She wouldn’t do anything about it so there were ants crawling all over my room. It got to the point where I was sleeping on the couch in the living room because I was so revolted. Finally, we ended up with FLYING ants instead that were bursting out of the crack under the window. What was I supposed to do? Ignore it? No, I paid for some pesticide out of my own pocket and sprayed inside the wall. Her lack of action made me pay the consequences, not her.

I actually did go to the school therapist for a few months, but I was getting really frustrated with our sessions and we were constantly butting heads. She really did not understand me at all.  Finally it got to the point where I was feeling worse after therapy than before and I decided we were not a good match and told her I was not going to continue to see her. The one good thing that happened as a result of seeing her is I got on medication for my anxiety, which does seem to help somewhat. Hopefully I’ll be able to afford to see another therapist once I get out of school and get a job.

I forgot to mention she is also a hoarder, so that makes it even more difficult. She’s very attached to material things. She used the horses as an excuse for why she couldn’t get a job at first. She stays home and takes care of them and her other animals all day. She has a running tab with a local feed store and she pays part of it off every time she makes another big order. I’m afraid to know how much she owes them and her credit cards. I know she’s pretty much had thousands of dollars of debt on credit cards my whole life and always makes the minimum payment."

I have a very difficult time being honest with therapists, but I knew I had to lay it all out there if I wanted help, so I did at my last session with the therapist I was seeing. Unfortunately, she still didn’t seem to get it and actually became pretty heated when she was giving me “suggestions” for what I need to do in the future.

Almost every tech I asked about it said they don’t bother palpating and just look for a little bit of light field above the shoulders. I notice that some people lean forward into the bucky, so I’ll ask them to step forward a little on the PA so they’re straight up and down. I’m not sure how you were taught to position the arms/shoulders, but we learned to have them put the backs of their hands on their hips (so their arms look like chicken wings lol) and tell them to roll their shoulders toward the board. I was clipping my laterals sometimes too (posteriorly), so now I check that there’s a little bit of light field behind them. It is hard to remember everything. I forget to check the rotation on laterals a lot too. We’ll learn from our mistakes though."

Radiology,fg72p7q,t3_ex9hsk,1580582591.0,"It’s different at every site. I’m in my second semester and we switch locations every three weeks. My clinical coordinator told us before we started, “There are 0’s and there are 10’s when it comes to x-ray techs. You’ll learn from both.” I’ve been to three different sites so far and most of the techs have been really great teachers, but some don’t like to teach and may avoid you/ignore you. Do your best to not take it personally. The equipment is also different at each site as is the workflow, so it can be hard to get your routine down. The techs expect you to make a few mistakes as you’re new, so don’t worry too much. Developing a routine makes things much easier, so try to do that early on. For example:    
- prepare the computer and equipment     
- go get the patient    
- introduce yourself    
- get them changed if necessary    
- ask for two identifiers    
- chance of pregnancy?    
- details about injury?    
- tell them a brief description of what you’ll be doing (how many images, standing or laying down)    
- take the images    
- explain to the patient what will happen with their images and how long before they will hear back about the results    
- walk them out/tell them if they need to check out or not    

Hope that helps. Let me know if there are any other specific questions I can answer for you."

AskDocs,feidxrb,t1_feibyh0,1579136260.0,I am an x-ray tech student and have observed bone density tests before. You could probably get one of those done if you get a referral from your doctor. They just lay you on a table attached to a machine that takes low dose x-rays of particular parts of your hip/pelvis and femur from what I recall - no pain involved or anything.
