TheMixedNuts,fr379le,t3_gmckvq,1589851370.0,"I was on PTO today, thank god.  I slept til like 11:30 when I got a call from Blick Art Materials.  I had ordered curbside and they needed to get my payment information and have me okay a couple of substitutions.

So I took the day off to get my blood drawn.  I kinda fucked up though... I was talking to the lady at Blick and just mindlessly started eating a banana.  Note, I NEVER eat when I first wake up.  Ever.  I was supposed to fast for my blood test, so my blood sugar is going to be high.  I hustled to the lab after I ate it though, so I'm hoping I hadn't really digested it yet.  I needed so many tests done that it took 5 vials of blood.  I hope it wasn't enough to drop my iron low enough that I can't donate platelets on Sunday.

I went to Blick after that, then came home and painted.  I was going for a beach theme, [but that's not what I got](https://imgur.com/gallery/rRKF69l).  I dunno, it's okay.  I like the colors, it's just not what I intended.  May try again at a later point when I'm more skilled.  I got paint freaking all over myself so I had to take a shower.

Hung out with C for a while, then I made dinner, which was [chickpea tikka masala](https://simple-veganista.com/chickpea-tikka-masala/).  It was really good!  I got the recipe from my sister.  She's vegetarian but often cooks vegan stuff, so we share recipes a lot.

I don't want to work tomorrow."

TheMixedNuts,fqsc7ns,t3_gkjkyk,1589603462.0,"Work was frustrating.  Usual bullshit with some extra bullshit on top.  One of my employees exposed himself to one of our new hires on the damn factory floor and was blowing up my phone because he didn't understand why he was being suspended.  I'm taking a mental health day on Monday.  Basically I just need to get blood drawn, but I'm required to take PTO in 4 hour increments and feel like I get nothing accomplished when I work a half day, so I'm taking the whole day.  My PTO doesn't roll over and I don't get paid out if I don't use it.  Last year I had 50 hours of PTO that I didn't use.  That is not happening again this year.  Plus I just found out that organization-wide we're each being given what amounts to a free mental health day between now and the end of June, which is pretty sweet.

I went to Walmart after work for the last few things I need to paint.  I couldn't find a kitchen torch (important in acrylic pouring), but C has a larger torch we could use in a pinch.  I've seen videos that they didn't use a torch, but it's used to pop air bubbles in the paint and in some cases create designs as well, especially in conjunction with silicone oil.  I might check Target tomorrow.  Worst case scenario I know they'd have a small torch at a head shop, they're just not particularly cheap.  I plan on painting tomorrow.

Apocalyptica did some live stream concert on YouTube yesterday that I watched today, which was pretty cool.  However, they played my favorite song, but the video skipped during my favorite part of the song, which ruined it.  Sigh.

Dinner was meant to be Spanish beans, but my kitchen is an utter disaster right now.  Plus, the recipe calls for canned butter beans, which the store did not have.  They had dried beans, but they take a solid hour+ to cook, so suddenly this 20 minute recipe turns into this two hour affair on top of the time it would take me to get the kitchen clean enough to cook in, and I just couldn't do it today.  I bought a package of Gardein chipotle Georgia-style wings and ate the whole damn thing.  Luckily I had the last of my mango tofu for lunch, so I at least had some real food today."
TheMixedNuts,fqoncb9,t3_gk28c6,1589519432.0,"So my work isn't allowing more than 2 people a day in the office til this all blows over.  I show up to the office today and my coworker is there, which is fine... Til one of my other coworkers shows up.  I hadn't realized it wasn't my day to be in the office.  We have a conference call right at the beginning of the day, but one of us had to leave after the call to work from home, so I volunteered.  Work itself was fairly uneventful, although I did have to fire someone for a shitty reason, which sucked.  C fell out of bed around 11 but was practically comatose, so I had a lot of trouble getting him back on the bed.  He's literally twice as heavy as me and wasn't cooperating.  I would've just let him keep sleeping on the floor if it wasn't for his bad back.

After work I went to the UPS store to return two shirts from LOFT that were too big.  The other mediums I got either fit or were just a little too big, but these were HUGE.  It sucks too because I really liked the pattern on both.  Upon doing more research, apparently LOFT is really bad about their sizes running large, which is probably why I'm a size 8 in their pants when the other jeans I have that fit are 10s.  I'm exchanging the shirts for smalls and hoping for the best.

Lunch and dinner were both leftovers (mango tofu bowl and vegetable bean soup, respectively).  I ate the last of the cookies, which is a good thing because I've been eating more calories than I'm burning.  I need to go back to eating less, and it's hard to do when you've got cookies and brownies."

I didn't sleep last night.  Got to be about 5am and I was only just then starting to get tired, but that would mean I would sleep til mid afternoon and eff up my sleep schedule for work tomorrow, so I just said fuck it and stayed up.  I obviously didn't have work at the restaurant today, which was a bummer.  I miss my coworkers, I miss my regulars, and I miss the money.  Mother's Day is the busiest day of the year.  Even with 4 servers and how inexpensive the food is, I usually clear at least $130-150 in tips in 6 hours.  I think my record was $176.  I miss the chaos honestly.  Chaos in this reality is my stupid computer system not working from home and spending an hour plus a day fighting with it.

We ran a couple errands in the town we used to live in.  Mostly though, we lazed around all day.  I watched paint pouring videos and browsed Reddit.  C ended up falling asleep around 2 in the afternoon.  I made my Kik alicha, which was pretty good.  It's now 8:13 and I'm about to be down for the count.

Edit: I finally got the bulk of my art supplies, aside from a shit ton more black and white paint and some smaller canvases.  I like all the colors I got besides maybe the purple that's quite a bit grayer than the picture.  So I'll have to buy a better purple as well as an orange and maybe a lime green."

It was just a touch bland, but I added more berbere and a bit more salt than it called for.  All in all, pretty tasty and easy, so I'll probably make it again.

Anyway, I didn't feel like fighting with it all day, so I went into the office for the remainder of the day.  Other than that, work was work.

I had to take Max to the vet after work.  He has a little crusty area on his chin that he's had for about a month.  I was worried he had a bad tooth or something that he was pawing at, but no, he's got acne.  TIL cats can get acne.  They gave us some medicated wipes for him.

Dinner was Beyond Burgers.  I bought some more art supplies online.  First of all, I made the mistake (again) of unintentionally buying canvasses that were too big.  Seeing as I'm just getting started, I should be working on like 8x10 or similar sized canvasses til I really get a feel for what I'm doing.  My dumb ass bought 16x20 canvasses.  4 of them.  Sigh.  Also, in watching more videos, I seriously underestimated how much black and white paint I'll need.  I'd only bought 1 4oz tube of each.  So I bought some more manageable 8x10 canvasses and more white and black paint.  My first order hasn't even shipped yet.  I would just order curbside from Michael's, but they don't have vegan canvasses.  The only brand of them I could find were from Blick, and our local Blick store only has curbside 11-4 M-F, and...

Today was okay.  I got a lot more done, although I still feel like I didn't accomplish as much as I set out to.  One of my coworkers may be fired if she doesn't get her numbers up.  She's awfully close to being below the minimum 40 active associates we have to have at all times.  So, as an office, we've decided that anyone working with our office that we assign this week will go under her name.  My numbers have gone down bad the last couple months, but I still have 118 active associates right now, so I'm more than safe, and bonuses max out at 70 active associates, so I still have some wiggle room before my bonus drops.  We need to keep her working.

We're supposed to wear masks once the office reopens and we start having people in again, so we ordered some from a local lady that makes them.  [I got 3](https://imgur.com/gallery/3Bvgidg).  They don't fit as close to my face as I'd like, but they're cute patterns, and unlike the ones I got on Etsy, the straps aren't too big around my ears.

I popped by Michael's on the way home to pick up some silicone oil I'd ordered online.  Still don't have my paint and canvasses, so it doesn't do me much good.  If it still doesn't come by the weekend, I might order a couple of things curbside from Blick.  They've got vegan canvasses there.  I honestly didn't think about canvasses not being vegan, but apparently most canvasses are primed with gesso, which is made from rabbit skin.  Gross.

I brush my teeth after the conference call.

We had some issues with our spreadsheet that we track our applicants with.  We have like 10 people working on the spreadsheet for this client, and somehow people were being moved to different parts of the spreadsheet when they shouldn't have been.  Like people being moved to the part for candidates who have passed backgrounds when their backgrounds aren't back (if they've even been run at all).  We had 2 people who were improperly moved and scheduled for orientation today.  One's background hadn't been run at all, and for that matter, he hadn't even done his onboarding forms at all.  The other's background hadn't come back, but if it's not all the way back yet, you can sometimes see the charges that have been found so far, and the dude was a sex offender.  Both were subsequently informed they could not attend orientation, but because this is the account I'm supposed to be in charge of, it's somehow my fault this happened, even though I'm not the one who moved them on the spreadsheet.  We have too many hands in the damn cookie jar.

After work, C and I went to the vape shop (they only allow a couple people in at a time, so I waited in the car).  He's trying to get me to switch to a smaller vape.  The juices for them have much higher nicotine content, so they produce much less vapor.  I'm on the fence about it still.  I like the big clouds.

I popped by then grocery store later to pick up a couple things the store we usually shop at didn't have, namely dried chickpeas (making falafel tomorrow).  They had paper towels!  Off-brand for sure, but it's literally been months since we've had paper towels.  Napkins just aren't the same.  They limited it to two small rolls per customer, but better than nothing.  As I was leaving the store, I saw a family of four get out of a SUV next to me.  All were going in the store.  It's supposed to only be one person per family in the store at a time, but these inconsiderate jackasses all went in together.  Oh, and none of them were wearing masks either.

 Lunch and dinner were leftovers.  I had my chickpea spinach pie for lunch, and balela salad for dinner.  I still have a serving of chickpea spinach pie to take to the office tomorrow."

I had tried to send it to him on Zelle, but apparently his bank didn't support it so it got sent back after hanging in limbo for a while.  And pretty much up until last week we were in quarantine.  But I did kinda forget til he texted about it last night.  I gave him a bit extra to try to make up for it.

I talked to my parents for a bit.  Mom says she only put my birthday card in the mail Saturday, so it's obviously not here yet.  They sent me some birthday money.  I'm going to buy art supplies.


I didn't read my coconut crusted tofu recipe very closely before I went to make it yesterday at 7:30.  You know, the part where you have to marinate the tofu for 2 hours after pressing it?  Fuck.  We made it today instead.  I managed to find time to step away from work for a few min here and there to press my tofu and make the marinade.  It was flipping amazing.  The sauce was the only thing I was a little meh about.  I made rice instead of quinoa, and roasted zucchini.  Kinda burned myself a bit when the oil popped, but it's barely even red now.  It's only the second time I've made that recipe because, while delicious, it's a pain in the ass to make.

Nova tried to steal my birthday bun right out on my hand."

But I hate lettuce, so I was pretty miserable.  First couple months were all salads and Tofurky wraps.  I legit got depressed eating like that.  After a few months I actually figured out how to feed myself, and in the last year I can probably count the number of salads I've eaten on my hands."

Actually, it saves us a lot of money with me going alone because I mostly stick to the list.  He's always finding snacks and stuff that he doesn't really need, but sound so good when he sees them.

I got cold feet for a couple years, then C was going to have surgery and was freaking out that something would go wrong and we'd never have gotten married, so we had roughly 2 weeks to get married from the time they scheduled the surgery.

TheMixedNuts,fo8u84g,t3_g6agox,1587603941.0,"C and I were up way too late.  Basically the unpleasantness that we were fighting so much was he was fucking with our phone plan.  Like he ordered a new phone without my consent, and then spent like 2 days on the phone with Verizon trying to change our phone plan for whatever reason, THEN he decided Verizon was fucking him over, so he decided to switch us to AT&T, and her decided he needed a tablet, whatever garbage.  So it literally took 3 days and switching phone carriers and I'm still freaking salty about it.  Anyway, we were up til nearly 2 last night.  8 am came way too early this morning.

Work was work.  I was working on a project for most the day that, in the end, really isn't going to make much of a difference.  They're toying with the idea of cutting our hours.  One of my bosses said that's not an eminent threat, but honestly, there's a lot of room to trim the fat without cutting recruiters' hours.  On our team (we have 3 branches in our market) we have 2 in-house temps and 3 RPOs (remote recruiters on loan from corporate) who I would think would come first.  Could be wrong, but I hope I'm not.  The main client I recruit for is slowing down their hiring and actually laying people off from being overstaffed.  My numbers suck right now.  I've only got a few hires this week and our goal is 10.  I spend so much of my day making sure other people's candidates are doing their onboarding, have backgrounds run, and are scheduled for orientation that I have almost no time to do any actual recruiting.  Not to mention all the admin bullshit I have to do managing our associates with that client (assigning in our system, performance calls, terminations).  Sigh.  I'm very stressed.

I went to the vape shop after work.  Our [masks](https://imgur.com/gallery/HuPXa3w) came in today.  They're a bit big on me, but they fit C perfectly.

I made [vegan sloppy joes](https://minimalistbaker.com/vegan-sloppy-joes/#_a5y_p=5243396) for dinner tonight.  Holy hell were they good.  I haven't had a sloppy joe in probably close to 25 years, and it hasn't really been on my radar since I quit eating meat.  I've loved everything I've made from that blog.

It was weird being around a live human besides C (we are only allowed to have 2 people max in the office at once).  I was there with my ""new"" coworker, who is actually the other recruiter I worked with when I was in client programs.  She also had her position eliminated due to restructuring, except rather than going straight to the branch like I did, she did a brief stint in corporate TA, which she hated.  I'm excited to be back working with her.  Work was busy today, so much so that I had to work more than 2 hours once I got home.  I posted an advertisement on Zip Recruiter Friday for a supervisor position that our client desperately needed to get filled, and I had 2 interview today.  They chose one for a final interview, and they seem pretty excited about him.  I hope it works out.

C and I got in a pretty nasty fight.  Definitely just words, but it got ugly.  I haven't apologized, but neither has he, so I'm wondering if I should.  He's been on my last damn nerve for 3 days now, and I reached my breaking point.

Dinner was leftover soup and toast with my homemade bread.  We ate the last of the soup, so I'll have to make something else tomorrow.  I'm leaning toward lentil sloppy joes.  I also have stuff to make chickpea spinach pie, but I want to save that for another day."

The roll out of the virtual orientations has been a little rocky.  We don't have the licensing to use Zoom, so we've been doing them with Microsoft Teams, and people seem to be having an issue with it.  Hopefully we won't take a huge hit to our numbers, because we have 45 or so openings that they need filled like yesterday.

We found out our local Mediterranean place is open for takeout, so I got a falafel wrap, fries, and baba ganoush with pita.  I feel like such a fatass.

May be TMI but I've been having a lot of digestive issues lately.  I'm specifically on meds for my IBS so I won't be constipated, but I still am.

Lunch and dinner were both leftovers (chickpea salad sandwich and tofu burrito bowl, respectively).  I watched some more painting videos.  Kinda wondering how irresponsible it would be to buy art supplies with some of my stimulus check.  We've been spending so much less on food now that we're mostly eating at home all the time that we can pretty much manage with me just having one job for now.  My student loans are in forbearance til October due to the virus, so that's $269 a month we don't have to worry about, plus the medical bill of C's we were paying on is paid off now, so that's another $120 a month we have available.

Dinner was [tofu burrito bowls](https://thefitchen.com/tofu-burrito-bowl-meal-prep/).  I did mine with black beans, rice, avocado, tomato, olives, and salsa.  C didn't eat his.

I know I shouldn't take it too personally when he doesn't eat what I make, but it still feels bad when I make dinner and he takes literally 2 bites and then won't touch it.  Sigh.

We were down to our last roll in both bathrooms, so it was about to be a bad situation.  We also got some fruit, almond milk, cereal, and protein bars.

We had a few more stops to make on the way home.  We popped by the vape shop first.  C's trying to get me to get away from using my big box mod while I'm getting over the bronchitis, so he picked up a pod for one of his other ones that's a pod system (the juice is much higher nicotine, but uses far less juice per puff, so about the same I guess?).  We also stopped at Dierbergs for a couple things.  I'm almost out of Better than Bullion, which I use for everything that calls for broth.  They were out, but C picked me up a couple jars of a different vegan bullion.  However, it's freaking chicken flavored.  Obviously artificially flavored, but now everything I use it in is going to taste like fucking chicken.  We also picked up C's Klonopin from CVS.
