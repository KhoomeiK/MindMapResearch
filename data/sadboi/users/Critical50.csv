EDIT: For real though. I go to local cafes often. Pay HALF the price what our customers are paying for the same drink. The local cafes also source much better coffee. Which for some, could be costing them much more if they're buying from other roasters or roasting themselves. Unless you know, they had their own supply chain that they own, like a certain million dollar company... 

Its also extra annoying that their POS system is quite slick to use because they use a tablet for their POS system such as Square. Ive used it before a lot. 10x faster and responsive than the Craigslist quality shit we have at Starbucks. I feel like Im in a run down Mom N Pop shop sometimes when I go to work after recently visiting a local coffee shop. :|

ZenyattaMains,fr28luh,t1_fr1ewg2,1589833020.0,"But overall my one tip to become better with Zen is hop into as many Deathmatches as possible as Zen. While you're in queue you can hop into a FFA. Sad thing is you'll only get a few minutes. 

The only way you can learn faster is to play more FFA, in my opinion. Give you more time to learn how to play against heroes that are difficult for beginner Zen players to take on, since many people are playing people like Genji, Tracer, Mccree, Pharah, etc. without having to listen to your team bitching. Give you more time to learn to be aggressive. Make mental calculations that come naturally rather than making yourself think about it.

I can give you all the tips I have, but overall learning how to play Zen is like learning how to be a sniper that cant one shot headshots like a Hanzo/Widow.

Thats how I learned most of my playstyle. I would go through FFA match after match."

ZenyattaMains,fr13x13,t3_glzlp4,1589812770.0,"Change the key binding for harmony/discord to mouse wheel. Its up to your own preference if you want up or down assigned to harmony/discord. But this allows me to apply healing to my teammate fighting, and discord whoever they're fighting just by flicking the wheel up and down. Then I can I can continue firing and using discord/harmony does very little to interrupt firing. So while applying your orbs to people, do not stop firing. 

You should also get a mouse with 3 buttons. I use my 3rd button for melee. Its saved my life a lot, having a quick melee button is quite useful. 

Learning when to charge volley and when to use regular fire is important. Going around a corner, charge a volley. No one to shoot at yet? Charge volley. This way you'll be able to get a lot more burst damage out. You can immediately follow up with primary fire to sweep up whats left. 

Hide behind your team. Be very wary of the area behind you. If its really easy for flankers to come at you, get away from there.

If you dont have some good headphones, I suggest you get some. OW isnt the only game that will benefit from good audio though, every game can be enjoyed a lot more if you have good headphones. On OW though, good headphones will help you with things like determining enemy location. Blizzard purposely made our teammates noise quieter than the enemies. I can hear reaper teleporting, doomfist charging, tracer blinking, pharah flying around, if they're on my left or right, and sometimes be able to tell how close/far they are. Sometimes I'll be able to pinpoint where reaper TP'd to, or where Doom is at. This way I can get a volley start charging up while I look for them. 

I also suggest you look for FFA in the arcade. Play as Zen only whenever it comes up. Its possible to win a lot. Keep in mind that you're regenerating health, while most of your enemies arent. Regular matches dont give you enough opportunity to practice with Zen.

Last, dont be afraid to use discord orb for a 1v1. Especially if you're around a lot of things for them to hide behind or take cover with. Discord lets you see their movement, like a really cheap x ray ability. Many people dont realize discords icon floats above them. Being able to see their movement can be a huge life saver. Ive used this on too many Tracer's thinking they're slick."

 However I dont mind that hes slow when it comes to combat. Zen being faster wont make you any better at Zen. Placement is important. Learning when to hide behind the shield and when to go for cheeky flanks. Learning to be aware of your surroundings and use the cover around you. 

What I think Zen really needed was just a buff on his harmony orb. By +5 minimum, but I'd be curious to see what a healing rate of 40 does. Its the main reason why people dont like Zen or dont see him as viable. People dont notice a Zen even when hes carrying pretty hard.

ZenyattaMains,fpy4l7y,t3_gg4uqu,1588995876.0,"My healing priority is flank DPS and other healer first. Then off tanks like Road, Zarya, D.va, Hammond.
Heals on rein feels quite slow. Let your main healer take care of him if available. Orisa is a good idea to heal and support. If whoever is playing Orisa is fairly accurate, you discording her targets and adding on more damage can be deadly.

Discording priority though is on tanks, main healers, flank DPS. 

Against rein, alternate between primary fire and charging volley. Rein players will often throw a fire strike every few seconds. If you constantly charge up volleys, you could have a volley with at least 3 orbs trained on his head ready to fire. You could also immediately discord him after, since theres very little delay. 

Learn to time when to charge volleys in the heat of battle against abilities like Genji deflect, tracer rewind, zarya bubble, D.va matrix, etc. 

Charge volleys when going around a corner. Charge volleys if no one is around to fire at. You'll have a whole lot of burst damage ready to fire. 

If your team is spamming down a hallway filled with enemies, dont spam your primary fire. They take one hit from you and just hide. Charge a volley instead. If you hit one, you're likely to hit more.

This is an outside game tip but, get some nice headphones. Not just for Overwatch though. IMO, having headphones that can help you pinpoint sound gives you a whole new advantage many, many people dont capitalize on. Zenyatta functions like a sniper in many ways. Hes fairly stationary, sits in the back, and provides support for people. Being as aware as you can be of your surroundings is quite important. I hear reaper teleport, I have a volley charging. I hear doom getting close I start charging. Especially since Im always shooting at him..they often try singling me out.

If you do online shopping often, amazon Prime is convenient to have. Not to mention the video and music streaming service. Its $13/month, you dont pay shipping fees again, and it arrives in 2 days. Why would anyone  logically go searching for those individual items off multiple different sites, and have to pay all the additional shipping fees?"

People shouldnt be getting arrested for going to the beach. Im just guessing but, I think that's a much safer recreational activity than letting people go into a confined building like a casino. People going to the beach already kept their distance from each other even before the pandemic."

On the map with the bridge I said we should all go to the left so we dont get blasted by pharah. Then they did something completely different and everyone yelled at me xD never again after that."

Man, being family doesnt gaurantee you'll be forgiven. If she wasnt family, but just a friend, you wouldve cut her out of your life a long ass time ago.

Whenever Im at a moral conflict with something like family I'd ask myself

""If they werent family, would I still be keeping them around?""

If the answer is no, good fucking bye."
AskReddit,fpq2kvy,t3_geelf7,1588813909.0,"A lot of desserts, specifically any chocolate. Except light roasts. (Theres light, medium, and dark) Light roasts can be a bit tart, or ""brighter"" tasting. Not my preferred roast, but people who do like lighter roasts have said fruity things go better with lighter roasts.

But in my experience, with most dark and medium roasts, chocolate is always a great pairing."

AmItheAsshole,fppt9n3,t1_fpprqqv,1588808711.0,"Standard measurement for coffee is 2 tablespoons per 6 fl oz. Her ratio is almost 4 tablespoons per 6 fl oz. I drink my own coffee black on a daily basis. No sugar, milk, cream, etc., I tried her coffee one day, without adding anything. I retched, and spit it out. It was almost as bitter as espresso. She puts creamer because she doesnt like the coffee taste. If she put less beans when she brews, it wouldnt be so bitter. If its not as bitter, she doesnt need so much creamer to mask the coffee taste. This isnt about her being happy or not with her coffee, but more the fact that shes consuming a ton of sugar in just one coffee cup a day. Creamers contain usually 5-6 grams of sugar per tablespoon. Her coffee has at least 6-7. In one cup alone, thats at LEAST 30 grams of sugar. She'll have at least one everyday. Sometimes two. Which puts her up to a minimum of 60 grams of sugar on a daily basis.

Theres still everything else I mentioned that she eats on a daily basis."
