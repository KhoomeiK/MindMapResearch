antiwork,fmed501,t3_fukivq,1585999516.0,"I definitely lack discipline lol. I should be programming, but instead I'll play video games because I code all week and don't want to spend my free time doing what is essentially work."
depression,fl6x1r4,t3_fgi879,1584886306.0,"I know that feeling. The last two days have been a struggle for me and right now I wish I didn't exist too. I often feel the same, that people wouldn't care but the truth is they would. I didn't realise just how much I needed my wife until depression hit me, and if you were gone I know it would hit your parents hard, and like me they would realise just how important you are to them. And with the web development thing, give it a go. Coincidentally I'm a web developer myself, and it can be very rewarding to build your own site that others can use. It will keep your brain occupied and busy as development provides a challenge. Check out The Net Ninja on YouTube, do his Python tutorial series and then his Django series. They aren't that long and you'll have your own blog at the end of it where you can vent. I hope this helps you in some way, and all I can say is that writing this to you has distracted me from wanting to burst into tears, so thank you for reaching out to Reddit."
depression,fl3h0jj,t3_fltp8a,1584783546.0,"No, it doesn't make you a horrible person. You are not your thoughts, plus it came from a good place because ultimately you care about your mum and don't want to break her heart. I've had the same thoughts, so you aren't alone there."

unpopularopinion,f1u0xw8,t1_f1quqsl,1569752965.0,agree. If you propose in public you deserve the embarrassment of rejection.
depression,f0rwg63,t3_d6294z,1568894311.0,"This is how I've been feeling (not the completely ready to make the ultimate decision, but the part about friends and family). I can't make anything better for you but I hope you're somehow able to find some sort of relief. Something that helps me sometimes is when I'm feeling shitty about going to work I just take it one step at a time. I just throw myself into work and try to keep myself busy so time goes faster. I also try to talk to colleagues while working to make work a bit more fun."

ChoosingBeggars,esoehvk,t3_c8m2gf,1562165932.0,You wouldn't expect a supermarket to give you baby items for free so why expect an independent businessperson to do so?
