He says he's fine and is happy that I love him so much, but I can't help but to feel like I'm annoying with how thick I lay it on. And then I feel like apologizing is just coming across as even more annoying and insecure, so I can't really win.

I just have an overwhelming amount of love for him I can't express it enough."

You're suggesting him cheating on her. That's awful advice. 

Dating and sex isn't a game. It's supposed to be partners communicating and expressing their desires to each other. Dating other women on the side to boost your confidence is fucking disgusting for so many reasons. 

Some people have higher or lower sex drives. No amount of confidence is going to necessarily change that."

TrollXChromosomes,eymeo70,t1_eym8orv,1567206945.0,"""If I believed in body shaming""
She is specifically saying she *won't* do that. Because she's not an asshole.

But it isn't because men will feel insecure. That's their problem. Body shaming is wrong because *there is nothing shameful about having a body*. You are a beautiful soul riding around in a beautiful vessel. To tell someone to be ashamed of how they look is wrong. Appearance doesn't physically affect anybody negatively. The way you look doesn't hurt anyone.

Who cares if some misogynistic men feel insecure. Maybe then they can understand how the entirety of western culture makes women feel."

How about ""I'm sorry I came across that way, it wasn't my intention. "" If you truly felt bad at all, then that's what you would say.

Which is a lot better and kinder than ""No, you're wrong for feeling offended. You're wrong for interpreting what I said differently than I intended."""
BPD,exp5ark,t3_ctvogb,1566486095.0,"Personally, I smoke every day. I find it helps prevent spiraling because it slows my brain down, and helps me kind of analyze *why* I'm feeling how I do, rather than just giving in to all the emotions.

It helps me sleep, stops some of the intrusive thoughts and anxiety I get alone in bed at night.

Plus it's recreational and just a decent way to relax. Smoke some weed, watch something funny, do some art, etc. It's a form of self care, really."

But it's important for me to have a place where I don't feel intruded on by men. Men constantly add themselves to conversations they aren't welcome in, and try to make it about them.

I just got a new therapist, and I'm hoping she doesn't say anything like what I've gotten before. But I'm getting to a point where I'm more able to speak up about it. I just need to be able to be calm about it and **not** threaten suicide over it haha... 

I wish you all the best with continuing your recovery, I appreciate the offer to talk. Might take you up on it, and of course its extended to you. Helping others definitely makes me feel better about myself."

I don't want to have to use skills to prevent a breakdown or psychotic behavior. I don't want to have to apply techniques I've learned. I just want to be fucking normal and not suicidal over a glass of spilled milk. 

It's getting so exhausting. I'll have a good day and think, just for a minute, that maybe I'll be okay and things will work out. But them I breakdown and spiral because of some stupid shit, and realize I'm fucked.

It was a rough time, I genuinely didn't know how long I'd be able to last until u did something drastic. But that was a few years and I'm in MUCH better shape. Finally took control of my mental health and listened to my doctors. I'd say I'm lucky, but very happy to be alive nowadays."

I had been getting increasingly paranoid about people plotting against me, bugging my house and car, people breaking in, typical tin foil hat hat stuff. One night, I was scared to turn the lights off because I KNEW the moment I did, someone would break in and do something horrible to me.

Eventually I crawled on the floor, down to the basement and hid in the safest corner I could find. I was hugging my knees, crying and so terrified that i was going to be killed any moment. I don't really remember any events of the days after that, but I know I'm on medication and haven't had any problems since."
AskReddit,eumpme0,t3_cgyyq9,1563918857.0,"My mother died when I was in 8th grade.

I don't think I can say I've ever ""recovered."" 7 years later and sometimes she pops up in my mind and I have a moment of grief. I have to take a break to cry and relive memories of her. And I'm sure I always will.

However, it gets easier every day. It is really hard. But every day you spend letting yourself have a normal life, the easier it is to go on and take care of yourself. I wasn't super close with my mom, but I miss her every single day.

I'm guess you lost a loved one if you're asking this question. My advice is to take care of yourself. Let yourself cry and grieve. But try your best to brush your teeth, take a shower, eat regularly. It will be easier to handle the emotional situation if your body isn't breaking down too.

Everybody grieves differently. Some people get numb, others are all over the place. You might feel anger or guilt. Don't feel bad about your feelings. You'll get through them, and it'll get easier."

I just don't know if it's ok to feel as strongly as I am.

He has helped me love myself so much. He points out the good in me, tells me how amazing I am and how he loves me, challenges me when I talk down to myself and helps show me how i can reframe things positively. He has helped build up my self worth. I am worried I'm kind of basing my worth on how he feels about me, but i definitely feel like I've valued my own health a little more since we started dating. He is just the best thing that's ever happened to me, I feel crazy in love like in movies and fairytales."
