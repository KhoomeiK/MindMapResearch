Tudorhistory,f080j4w,t3_d45jo9,1568472717.0,I recently read “Sister Queens” by Julia Fox and the story of Juana of Castile’s life both saddens and infuriates me. It goes into more detail about the incidents mentioned in this article and is a good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about a woman who has been unfairly maligned by history.
AskWomen,f05vftr,t3_d3uwa5,1568420873.0,"From my own experience, I would make these recommendations:

Make it clear that there is nothing shameful about the female body.  It's okay to wear clothes that show skin, and words like ""period"" or ""breast"" don't require euphemisms or hushed tones.

Talk to your daughters about sex and relationships.  All that I got was a basic explanation of what sex is.  As an adult, I quickly discovered that there was a *lot* that I didn't know about enjoying sex, safe sex, consent, and healthy relationships.

Teach boys and girls how to cook and clean.  My dad in particular made a big deal about the importance of me knowing how to do household chores, but it was never quite as important for my brother to learn these things as well.

Don't shame other women for their appearance, particularly their weight.  I grew up listening to my dad make comments about some women needing to wear a paper bag over their face, call overweight women ""bigs,"" refer to my mom as ""chub,"" and try to push physical fitness on me so I could avoid things like flabby arms or large thighs.  I still have a lot of hang-ups about my facial features, wearing ""appropriate"" clothing, and especially my weight.

Watch how you treat other women and how you talk about them.  Your daughters will learn from both of their parents how to talk about a woman, how to act in friendships and romantic relationships, and how to expect others to treat them."
introvert,f02x1hp,t3_d3dimu,1568339932.0,"I always knew that I was different than other people, but it wasn’t until I got a little older (maybe around 7 or 8) that I started to think something was wrong with me.
