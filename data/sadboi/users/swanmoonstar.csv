bipolar,fkygiob,t3_fle85h,1584648282.0,"Man, I’m so sorry that you are on the supporting end and loving someone who suffers from bipolar disorder because it hurts. I got bipolar. I am married, soon to be divorced. From my experience, my feelings drastically changed when I was manic and I was delusional and convinced that I didn’t love my husband and that I would be happy elsewhere. When I came out of mania, I realized that I was so lost and I couldn’t explain my actions. Unfortunately is very confusing. My memories made no sense either. They were fueled by my delusions so I could only remember what made sense according to the delusion, that he was not available to me. Anyway, I didn’t wanna take my meds because I was doing so great in school and work and it took a depression and then substance abuse and more depression for me to realize that I need meds. Still, I have reservations about my meds because I wanna have children and they are not safe when you’re pregnant, some worse than others... it is a very personal experience. I think I had to see how serious my disorder was for myself for me to decide to seek help, take meds, seek therapy, etc. If you and friends and family come in to the rescue, she might not face the negative consequences of her disorder and thus think she is fine when she isn’t, in my opinion. I don’t know everything. I hope this helps in some way.... I’ll keep you and your family in my prayers."

Codependency,fik0evp,t3_f86p47,1582469613.0,"So I think the underlying fear, this might not be true for you, but for me, has always been, that he is the only one who will love you. That’s it. 

So thinking that, it makes you hold on so tight that the other person literally can’t breath.

I’m glad to have changed my ways, unfortunately, I’m still not so healthy and push people away instead when I’m feeling needy. Still, it’s romantic to think he’s the only one in the whole wide world who could possibly get you and love you, etc. but I think that the more you go out and do, volunteer in your interests, go to school, etc, the more people you meet, and the more chances you have to meet people who get you and click with you.

It doesn’t mean this won’t work out. The history right now is messy. 4 days is an eternity of waiting, I know, and be proud for being so patient. But it doesn’t mean that waiting is all it will take either, and unfortunately these tendencies don’t go away overnight too, like wanting to know where somebody is every second of the day and what not... so in a way you will be doing the work but he has to accept that you are doing the hard work but that won’t change the past and it won’t change everything drastically, it’s more gradual... some boundaries for the future might help.

Maybe this is up in the air right now and he could take this job, and it really feels like he is the only person in the world who could possibly wanna be with you, but in reality you deserve to be loved and to feel like you are more than enough for yourself and anyone else.

Codependency,fia8gbp,t3_f6tdnq,1582295572.0,"So I invited him over because I came to the conclusion that seeing him was not the problem, but rather overdoing it was. It went great and I actually talked to him about not staying at my place for a while since it was very hard on me to get used to the days that he couldn’t stay here. Again he was understanding. New territory to me. I’ve been in relationships where that would have been fought every step of the way. So we spent some time together and were sexually active, which is so amazing with him, and then he left like we talked about. He texted me when he got home. My mom doesn’t live here and is visiting next weekend so I asked him, impulsively, if he would want to meet her. He said he would think about it. I said ok. I’m proud of myself for not pushing the subject. But I’m insecure about it. I slept great since last night too so that is progress. But this morning I have thought about it like 1000 times. Should I rescind my offer. If you have to think about it then you are not sure and that’s ok. Maybe this is the end. This will change everything. He’s not that serious about me. Blah blah blah blah.....

It’s exhausting, but we are all here in this sub fighting this thing together. Perhaps that helps you, focusing more on the positive things that you have done and the people who you have positively impacted 💗"

As great a you are feeling now, enjoy it, but in my experience my depression and anxiety don’t get cured for good. Some things make it way better, like not drinking and not having caffeine or cigarettes. But even after months of not doing any of those doings, I still got depression. I think it can be setting up for disappointment to think it will stay gone...but doing so much better without weed is awesome. Ok."

bipolar,evf9kwa,t1_eveaalh,1564491689.0,"Feeling empty or numb is not right. I don’t give a shit what the doctors say. They don’t go through it, so they can’t say for sure that emptiness is not miserable. I feel like that is worse than feeling depressed to me. I’d rather ride out the mood wave then not feel any of them."
bipolar,evf97e8,t3_cjm905,1564491467.0,I felt that type of emptiness from meds before. It sucks. They’re not interacting like they’re supposed to for you. Hopefully you can switch one of them soon and see if that helps. I still feel that emptiness from time to time even though I’m not on meds for psychosis. I guess the combination of coffee and alcohol can throw me off although I drink like once a week. It’s so hard not to do something to throw my body off tho because the lows can get so rough and seem endless.
