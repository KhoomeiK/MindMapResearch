AmItheAsshole,fr1x52l,t3_gm7aux,1589827420.0,NAH. Some people are just weird about food. At one point in time I was in a situation where I was denied access to food or when I did have access most of it would be taken. It lead to me being very possessive of my food. When my wife and I first moved in together I was the same way as you fiancé. It took quite a bit of individual therapy regarding my odd relationship with food until I reached where I am now and can easily share again without fearing that because I'm sharing I'm gonna go hungry. I'd recommend that your fiancé try therapy. I mean it literally couldn't make things worse and most people find it helpful. I think it would help him come to terms with why he feels this way about food and to help come up with ways to address these negative habits.

In the case of a dating couple the money is assumed to come from a joint source. I also know this from buying a car with a girlfriend of mine. She put in very little I paid for most of it. And even though I could prove that most of the money was mine we had to split the proceeds of the sale of the car 50/50 when we split because it was considered a commingled asset that belonged to the couple rather than an asset that was proportionately 70% mine 30% hers.

And unlike the roulette table wining brings the odds ever more in your favor.

The key is to not let yourself become bitter over things that have happened to you in the past. Yeah I've had relationships go up in flames but I held on to the good times the things that made those relationships worth it and held on to the lessons only gained from losing everything that have lead me to work on myself and becoming a version of myself that I can like.

AmItheAsshole,fqz6npn,t1_fqz1xew,1589760987.0,"It's not one personal interest if you honestly plan wholeheartedly to stay together forever. It's in the interest of the couple as a whole to make a sacrifice to improve earning potential in the future. In the long run while she will not immediately benefit in the short term she will long term.

Once he starts pulling in better money her standard of living will improve as well, down to the kinds of food she will eat, for the rest of the time they remain a couple and depending on how the local laws are possibly even after. 

Part of what makes relationships work long term is unit cohesion. Looking at the couple as the primary unit rather than it's individual members. 

For example, when my wife was my girlfriend she needed a car. She had no car and it would make getting to work for her much less of a chore and she could go places unreachable by public transportation. It probably cost around $5,000 down with another $5,500 on a note.

I cannot even drive. I have a condition that makes it impossible for me to hold a license. I see no direct benefit to her having a car. I still have to take public public transportation to work most days. I literally cannot (not as in don't know how but more like I can't tell any relative distances beyond arms length.

But the car benefits the family unit. With it I can go in earlier than the bus and she can drop me off netting us more hours. She can work later than the bus runs again netting more hours. And together this added money lead to an improved standard of living.

OP sees the improved standard of living they could see as a unit working towards unit goals. OP's girlfriend is not willing to look past individual benefit to the unit. She doesn't see the two of them as a family unit while OP does. To me that would raise red flags. Pretty big ones."

AskMen,fqxbqh3,t1_fqx8zfy,1589729546.0,"There's nothing wrong with passing judgment. Passing judgment is one of humanity's most basic psychological functions. Hell I'd honestly place it as the most important function. We constantly judge everything around us to see what is good for us or bad for us and make decisions based off of these judgments to live our lives.

The problem comes when you fail to think about the basis of your judgments. When you don't exercise this kind of meta-judgment and judge your judgment making you can be lead to make extreme judgments about other people and situations focusing only on one aspect of the situation.

You seem to be mostly cognizant of your judgment making process. You have your own thought out and founded reasons for disliking drug use in general. However I propose that you have failed the most important part of the meta-judgment process in that you are unwilling to see things from the other side.

It seems you perceive all drug use from an extreme point. That you are all drinking as heavy drinking and all smoking as being a massive stoner. You say yourself that using cannabis medically is a non-issue and bears no negative judgment on the patient. Likewise I propose that moderate smoking and drinking are similarly a non-issue.

Any drug can be used as medication. Take Desoxyn it's medical grade dextromethamphetamine used in small doses for the treatment for narcolepsy or severe adhd. It is a wonder drug for those who need it. Likewise a small dose of THC or ethanol can be a small wonder in helping one relieve the stress of the day. 

We all self medicate all the time with over the counter medications. We've all taken ibuprofen, acetaminophen, loperamide, diaphenhydramine, or any other number of other medications without the advice of a doctor. And at low doses this is perfectly fine and not an indication of any moral failing.

I can totally understand not wanting to be around people who are severely intoxicated. I'm not a big fan of severely drunk people myself. But again in and of itself I personally find severe intoxication and even addiction not as a personal failing. Instead I look at them more as a maladaptive coping mechanism that indicates a lack of appropriate mental health care. I argue it's not something to be looked at as a moral failing but rather as something to be seen as sad and something to be looked at with pity.

I'm not saying you have to look at these things as I do. I'm just trying to share my perspective on the matter and promote metacognition regarding your judgments. This type of thinking will help you more and more as you grow older and gets easier and easier with time. I recommend you take a close look at all your perceptions to come to terms with why you feel how you feel."

All my people time was spent with her and when we weren't together I used that time to be alone and recharge.

AmItheAsshole,fquwucr,t1_fquwhdp,1589665757.0,Because after the 100th time you're simply exhausted and exasperated with the same bullshit and eventually you let it all out.
AmItheAsshole,fquwo73,t3_gl2zpa,1589665680.0,NTA. Her constant fascination with your apearence and inability to accept that which makes you happy must be exhausting. It's always an asshole move to harp on someone about something they have already told them you have no intention of changing. Stay strong sometimes these fights blow up huge in your face if it does remember that you are definitely not the asshole
AmItheAsshole,fquvzxk,t3_gl2u4p,1589665392.0,Your name is probably the second most important piece of information about you after your DNA sequence. Continuously refusing to call someone by their name and instead chosing a diminutive to call them by is disrespectful and demeaning to the one who's chosen name you refuse to use. NTA. It's always an asshole move to demean your coworkers and make them uncomfortable and it's on the coworker to know when they have crossed the line.

AmItheAsshole,fquupn6,t1_fqutr2b,1589664841.0,"Judging is a primary human function. It's probably the most primary. It's how you decide literally anything. Judging the wife to the brother is exactly what is necessary in this situation. OP needs to share his judgment that what his sister in law is doing is fucking twisted, that she's sick, and that not allowing a 3 year old to eat enough to gain enough to grow is abuse. OP being a teen has nothing to do with anything you're simply trying to discredit OP based on their age and that is not only fallacious, but also asshole behavior. OP if you read this, this situation may warrant a call to CPS. Not only will they make sure your niece has access to sufficient food but may be able to get your sister in law the help she needs with her obvious body dysmorphia."

As the result of past trauma I cannot feel safe without the means of protecting myself. The boyfriend is not necessarially dangerous or a problem at all. In fact I think that you are the problem for being unable to place yourself in another's shoes and immediately calling for a breakup. OP I think your situation is NAH just a conflict of worldview. But to you commenter you are an asshole.
AmItheAsshole,fqustga,t3_gl2ke9,1589664048.0,"NAH. This seems really complicated on the surface but it's actually really simple. Her children want her ashes, the mother doesn't want them to have her ashes, and the only one you have a responsibility to is your great aunt. It's gonna be a shitload of drama and a whole to do but there really are no assholes here just hurt and imperfect people."
AmItheAsshole,fqurzzn,t1_fqur6hj,1589663697.0,Judgment leads to action. Judgment isn't inharently bad or unwaranted. In this case OP judges the behavior of the mother to be dangerous to her child. It is OP's judgment of her sister in law that will lead OP to protect this 3 year old girl from the psychological damage her mother will cause. In this case I believe the Judgment is not only warranted but is in fact a good thing.
AmItheAsshole,fqur5b1,t3_gl2c2k,1589663314.0,NTA. No matter how much your ex friend is unable to see that girl as an object it doesn't make her one. You can't call dibs on people as people aren't property.
AmItheAsshole,fquqlo2,t3_gl2az5,1589663077.0,NAH what happens at the table happens. So long as it wasn't done to bully the player in question there are no assholes here at all.

AmItheAsshole,fqtr2xr,t1_fqtbior,1589644450.0,No he's simply revising his expectations to fit the new separated finances. That's not pulling away it's not being a doormat.
AmItheAsshole,fqtqipp,t1_fqtgq9l,1589644133.0,Ouch then yeah yta.
AmItheAsshole,fqtbmkt,t1_fqtb73z,1589635445.0,Oh yeah she totally is just admiring these topless pictures. Get a fucking grip.
AmItheAsshole,fqt9xcl,t1_fqt9v5p,1589634203.0,And you are by accepting societies dictates that breasts serve primarily as sexual organs.
AmItheAsshole,fqt9tmk,t1_fqt9q2n,1589634124.0,Idts. You're the one oversexualizing breasts here. They're literally for feeding babies. I see no false equivalence.
AmItheAsshole,fqt94qc,t1_fqt87jf,1589633597.0,The compromise was to take her shower while he prepared breakfast not play on her phone and demand the shower when OP needs it to go to work. An alternative would have been to let OP take his shower and for her to make breakfast. She wanted to do neither of those things. This is straight NTA territory. The skulking about after OP says no he needs the shower first is straight up passive aggressive crap.
AmItheAsshole,fqt8rqx,t1_fqt8hz4,1589633311.0,If op is paying for their ingredients this is simply not true. Fresh strawberries are expensive especially this early in the season. I can literally not buy enough for one good sized smoothie for less than $4. Making a little extra here and there adds up in costs quick NTA.
AmItheAsshole,fqt8ib2,t1_fqt86xw,1589633106.0,It sounds like they had an understanding that she continuously benefited from until she had to put something back in. Her backing out the moment she's expected to pick up the slack OP's been carrying for her smells like bullshit to me.
AmItheAsshole,fqt8a8u,t1_fqt7zjv,1589632929.0,She wanted to separate finances. They're now separate. She has to build the trust to enter back into a shared financial situation. She violated his trust in the relationship. It's not passive aggressive to want to put in some distance now that that trust is damaged. The onus is on her to help fix this not OP to blindly trust her assertions once things aren't going her way.
AmItheAsshole,fqt7u0j,t1_fqt6aa3,1589632576.0,Fuck that. If he covered his wall in topless women she'd be just as upset and all the judgments would be NTA/NAH. While I do think it is a shitty situation I do not feel that OP is being an asshole in the slightest.
AmItheAsshole,fqt7ltm,t1_fqt6mto,1589632393.0,Is it really ESH though. It's definitely more NTA. They had an arrangement and she decided to go back on it the moment it didn't benefit her. That's straight horseshit and you know it.

entitledparents,fqmmmae,t1_fqm23ur,1589479963.0,I had to send a box of sex toys to my parents as packages were vanishing off the porch. When it arrived in nondescript packaging they grew suspicious. I figure they thought it was some dark web shit like drugs. Long story short they opened the package to come face to face with a massive strap on dildo. They've never opened anything since.

AmItheAsshole,fpxxues,t1_fpxt5mb,1588991812.0,Especially computers. It literally probably contains all of OP's personal information on it. Not only is she a thief she completely disregarded the OP's right to have his data kept private.
