self,fqydeuf,t3_glg2ac,1589746787.0,"I have that same feeling. My own dog died in the same way, I actually felt more guilty for the life he had rather than sadness that he died. In this way I have been trying to be better to my living dog, because I feel more guilty for lacking sadness than I do feel any actual sadness. 

When my aunt died I didn’t cry, I was more sad for the people actually crying. In my opinion, sometimes death doesn’t feel real. It doesn’t truly set in that that person is gone, and sometimes it will take a long time for the grief to come because you haven’t processed that the loss is real. For example, when my boyfriend’s friend died and my boyfriend told me, my first instinct was to laugh because I felt it was a joke, it didn’t seem like it was happening. 

For your family and the lack of sadness when picturing their deaths, perhaps it is because that has not happened and it does not feel real. Your brain can’t truly picture the reality of it, or perhaps like you said you just lack the relationship that results in sadness from loss. When my aunt died, when my great grandfather died, I didn’t feel anything and I was guilty. But it is actually because we lack the relationship that creates the depth of loss. 

If my close friend died, it my boyfriend died, I know I would be devastated because I have a very close relationship with them. But if say a family member I just never was close to died, there wouldn’t be any loss. If you have that kind of relationship with your family, it wouldn’t make a big difference if they were gone. I am sure it would be surreal of course, no need to feel guilty or think something is psychologically wrong with you. I think if you lost someone or something you are legitimately close to and they weren’t suffering and it wasn’t their time, you might have a different reaction. 

Right now your dog died but they suffered a lot, and it was their time, and they are at rest. It is better to feel relief than be sad they are gone. I think that’s proper reaction."
emetophobia,fqy2suu,t3_glkcc2,1589741668.0,"I sit under running hot water, drink sprite, and smoke weed when I am nauseous/anxious. I do think weed is something I shouldn’t rely on so I’ve been trying to quit and the addiction has kind of made the nausea a little worse, but every now and again it really helps. Something like CBD is a wonderful alternative. 

However my advice for you is eating fruits and vegetables rather than chips and snacks might be better for you because overall your body desires the natural alternatives. You can’t go wrong eating fresh vegetables and fruits!"
emetophobia,fqy21ft,t3_glklu5,1589741313.0,"I’m sorry you’re experiencing that. Personally CBD helps calm me down when I am experiencing nausea. I am not sure of your opinion on weed but for a while weed would help me every time I was nauseous. I live in California where it is legal so it’s easier to obtain, if that’s not for you however when I am experiencing nausea typically heating pads and sitting under running hot water really really helps me. Just having something warm over my stomach keeps the pain at bay & allows me to forget about it temporarily.

You can do this! The nausea will pass if you let the birthday take your mind off it. Typically for me the issue with this stuff is hyper focusing on it and the anxiety and focus just makes it 10x worse. I feel bad for recommending weed cuz you have a newborn child and there is a stigma about it! But I definitely think CBD is very helpful, and rubbing hemp lotion on my body always helps me to relax. Perhaps try ginger as well if you have not, and sprite always helps me to burp which definitely relieves nausea. Good luck! I hate having this same issue, but it is the fear that gets us and just relaxing and letting your boyfriend take your mind off it might help to ease the nausea best."

My advice is just to have a little bit, if you desire sushi maybe treat yourself with 2-3 rolls every now and again. I also get sushi from more reliable sushi shops, rather than grocery stores or something like that. 

Good luck with your fear, you are not alone and I experience that same thing, but sometimes just a little bit won’t give me anxiety, I won’t eat enough to make me full ever!"

To me that is a lot like that feeling I get where I need to be doing something but I do not know what. A part of being alive is just wanting to distract and do, but sometimes we can sit with what we do not know and find a certain joy in trying to figure it out. 

Perhaps it is something else to you, but that is what I’m interpreting out of what you’re saying. I just find a certain beauty in the fact that there is mystery, and to be confused is perhaps you just trying to make sense of what does not need to be made sense of."

It’s an interesting thing, it’s happening because LSD is the same molecular structure of serotonin. Serotonin regulates our appetite, our temperature, and pretty much most of our senses and such. So when you are on LSD the chemical affects all of these things, like sending extra ‘serotonin’ ( the LSD chemical structure similar to serotonin) to your stomach and therefore activating it in a way that decreases appetite, similarly to when we have an adrenaline reaction we have decreased appetite in the same way. It’s a very interesting thing once understood scientifically, it also explains increased anxiety as this same thing happens when our fight or flight instinct is activated."

After all these supportive comments I hope to confront my boyfriend in a way that he will understand how I feel. Thank you for your comment, it helps me feel more courage and more secure in my own feelings. I do understand kicking him to the curb if he presses the issue too much, because my own body and my own safety is more important than his desire.

Also I think it’s so sweet of you to compromise for your own SO like that. When you really care about someone the things you want aren’t as important, it’s okay to sacrifice a small want when that person isn’t able to do that thing you want. My boyfriend should do the same thing! And I am glad you find joy in your partner enough to know those things aren’t important in comparison to how much you care for them.

The only thing that helps is being drunk because then I can’t fight it and I’m too out of it to feel incredible anxiety. My advice for people is it’s okay to be afraid of it, but the fear is what causes the most pain. If it gets in the way of how you live your life, if you can’t go out and be around people and do certain things, then at that point it’s negatively affecting your life.

But if you get anxiety when your n* I think that’s okay, just got to take deep breaths and accept it honestly. Just accept the feeling, and the calm that comes makes it go away. As soon as you stop fearing it, the pain disappears."

There are no toxic people, really only people putting up rude fronts because they’re afraid of themselves and anger and lashing out is their form of coping.

As long as you work for what you wish to achieve, you can accomplish anything, so long as you don’t give up. 

As soon as you give up it’s all lost. Keep going, you WILL finish your junior year. Things might have fallen off right now, you might be trapped in a heap of shit, but it’s never too late to turn your life back around. People fall into rough times, and pull through it, because they do not give up. 

I believe you can do it! But you’re going to have to pull off some work to do that. Instead of putting it off for tomorrow, force yourself to start it, TODAY. For your future self, your present self needs to sacrifice some time and energy. 

It sucks, it truly does, and everyone hates it, but life is composed of hard work, determination, and the drive to never give up even in the face of all the shit piled on top of us. But you have the power in you to succeed at whatever you hope to, you just have to try. I know not having the motivation, the passion, the drive, it destroys us.

However, my work IS closed due to the virus, my school still costs the same amount as before, and because I didn’t file taxes I don’t get shit out of this. So many loopholes in this plan it’s ridiculous."

rant,fooj42e,t3_g85ax5,1587939976.0,"Even some people in the comments are trying to defend the statistic. Not saying that maybe the statistics are not all correct, but the fact is billionaires shouldn’t exist. Someone out there has so much money they couldn’t spend it all in their lifetime, while other people are starving in the streets. 

Nobody deserves billions. No amount of work or accomplishment deserves that kind of wealth. No matter how smart you are, no matter how innovative your achievements have been, that money can be used for better things. 

Bill Gates for example, sure he’s donated to charities. Sure he’s basically eliminated polio in certain countries. Does he still deserve all his wealth? No way in hell. But if he’s going to have that much wealth anyway, Bill Gates could change the world. He could fund endeavors that could save millions of people’s lives, but instead he invests in specific things like vaccines, and charities, which sure those are good too, but imagine if he invested in creating better economies for poor countries. For example, I saw this African island on YouTube that was starving. The people had no food, no water, and lived in huts. They had to borrow from the neighboring island to get these things. 

One man, not even a rich man, changed everything for them. He planted plants on his island, and then donated them to that island so that they had more ressources, and less bare ground. With the help of other not rich people, he was able to build a reservoir for that island and the people were finally able to start functioning on their own. 

That kind of monumental change was made by a man without billions, and still people claim, ‘ We shouldn’t expect Bill Gates to do anything for anyone, he earned that wealth and it’s his to do what he wishes with.’ If Bill Gates actually cared about the world he wouldn’t have 100 billion right now. He wouldn’t waste his money funneling it into charities which don’t make permanent change, charities are only a bandaid over a much greater problem. People are poor because their hard work earns them nothing, people are poor because their environment lacks resources, they lack self sustaining systems that other larger countries have, and these are issues even millions could solve if they were invested properly. 

Jeff Bezos could do the same thing, and every billionaire there is could make a difference if they legitimately cared, if they legitimately thought things through and looked at the bigger picture. 

And people have this obsession with billionaires, as though they’re some higher form of human being because they have it all. All these people are as human as the rest of us, but people suck their dicks because capitalism has made them believe that if only they worked hard enough, were smart enough, they could have it all just like those billionaires. 

If you had a 100 billion just chilling in your bank account and half the world was dying living on nothing, could you really sit there and watch? I’m sure a lot of people could, and that’s why no one should have that wealth. It makes me sick what money does to change a person, the level of greed these people in power have. 

And I haven’t even gotten into the offshore accounts, the tax evasions. Our society is structured so the rich get richer while the working class slaves all their hard work into making those rich people richer. Anyone who thinks they can defend the billionaires hoarding their billions, only do so because they have it in their minds that if they worked hard enough they could deserve that wealth too, while they also think it’s okay for dumb people to starve because they don’t happen to be as smart as Bill Gates. 

I’m so tired of seeing people suffer while a select few live in luxury. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice to have beautiful things, to be able to be financially stable, to reap the rewards of all your hard work. 

But some people work their whole lives and never end up close to getting out of their shit hole they were born into. And people defending the billionaires, people who think Bill Gates is some kind of legend, I don’t think they grasp how fundamentally fucked up it is for all that money to be sitting there, collecting, while the 22 million people in America have lost their ability to make anything, people in the Middle East and Africa and South America fear for their lives, they go to bed hungry, they live in a society of rags and dirt, and an investment into a better economy is possible for them. There are people out there with the money to do it, but don’t give a fuck enough to ever change anything."

Sometimes people are assholes, get so wrapped up in themselves, that they manage to hurt you in the process. I have that same problem with friends, it hurts that they don’t hit you up first. It makes you feel like they have no interest in being your friend. 

But the best way around that is to not let that determine how you see yourself. You know there are good qualities about you, you are worthy of friendship, and never let anyone’s opinion of you or involvement in your life be a measure of how you see yourself. They are simply missing out on you. 

That’s including Beth. I don’t mean to hurt you, but it might be best to move on from Beth because it seems she has been leading you on. I know what it’s like to love someone who doesn’t give you the time of the day, but then sometimes act as though you matter to them. It’s a roller coast of emotions. 

But you got to do yourself a favor and not let people treat you like an option. Someone out there is going to make you feel wanted, and won’t push you away without a clear explanation as to why. 

Don’t let Beth detract from your view of yourself. She doesn’t know what she’s missing out on. And she doesn’t deserve all your thoughts and care if she isn’t going to appreciate it and return it in kind."

These things shouldn’t matter at all, whether some movie properly represents all characters or not. If a movie has a gay character, or a black character, or an Asian character, it shouldn’t define the entirety of that character’s story, it should just be a minor facet of that person that shouldn’t be specifically hammered into our brains that they’re not classically white, or straight, or whatever."

Watch Serpentza on YouTube, he’s really highlighted how the acceptance of cultural practices in China by certain people allow that behavior to continue. That behavior SHOULD be condemned, even if not all Chinese people are doing it, so that it can be changed and therefore no Chinese people are doing it.

I always try to keep in mind that my emotions are just another illusion, they are also a perception that limits our view of the world. The good thing about emotions is that they fade, and when I am feeling some sort of pain I keep in mind that it is only a temporary state that is draining me of my passion for the world. I might just be lucky enough to not have experienced a great pain that truly makes me question my love for life.

If you’re going try LSD make sure you have not eaten in at least two hours, preferably just an empty stomach. Any nausea would come from your head, and overthinking about your stomach and all if you have anxiety over nausea. 

But honestly a lot of nausea on psychedelics is made worse by being anxious over it. Personally if I get nausea on LSD though, it is easy for me to remind myself it is all in my head and forget about it. Just my two cents, LSD is probably my favorite psychedelic but it’s a lot more stimulating than shrooms and won’t cause nausea nearly as bad as shrooms does. 

I do recommend if you ever want to try shrooms again, do a lemon tek. Completely helps with the nausea."
