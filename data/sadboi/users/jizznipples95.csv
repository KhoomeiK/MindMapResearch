The best thing to do is to let them off and let them get comfortable in the environment and have a chance to run away from the other dogs. If this doesn’t work either then unfortunately the dog park probably isn’t the best option, though you can try to go at a time when it is not busy and there a few or no other dogs, let him get used to the environment and then after a while start going at more busier times. 

My partner and I had to go to the dog park about 5 times before our rescue was even comfortable going in the gate, then we had to go so many times when there were no other dogs and had to slowly introduce her to a busier environment. 

Most of the fights I’ve seen in dog parks at when people keep their dogs on a lead and the dog feels trapped.

My dog was doing her normal annoying barking at random sin the park across the road, so I went to bring her inside, as I got her in the cat saw this opportunity for him to break free, he sprinted outside and down the front steps, I chased after him, panicking (he didn’t have his collar on and I’ve been told rangers are euthanasing cats without ID, so we’ve kept him locked up for weeks) I ran after him forgetting about the door and gates. I tripped and fell down the front stairs, but still managed to catch him and haul his ass inside. On the way to the door though, my asshole dog saw her opportunity for freedom and bolted past me while I was holding an angry scratchy cat, and ran into the park. I then had to spend an hour chasing her up and down the park and back streets. Thankfully someone offered to use their dog as bait and bring him into our yard for her to follow, so thanks to that kind lady.

I’d be happy with a part time/casual job in fast food, night fill, admin, pick packing, basically anything other than sales or manual labour (I have back issues and am very unfit) I’d also consider doing photo shoots as a bit of a side hustle on top of a job for some extra cash.

I’ll be looking into doing all of this. My mental health is at a point where I am right on the edge of starting to live a ‘normal’ life again. These extra tips are very helpful, I’m going to write out a condensed version of this list! 

I am a photographer and have run my own small business before, I’m currently doing a bridging course for uni in hopes to study media and journalism, but while I’m doing so I want to work part time and maybe do photography on the side as a side hustle, it’s helped our income in the past. 

I’m confident I will get to a point with my mental health where I can study and work, I’ve done it before, had 3 full days study and 4 days 8 hr shifts, it was crazy, but I did it! If I could do it then, I can do it again! 

We already have a copy of the barefoot investor (one of our family members is even featured in one of his books), it was gifted to my partner to read, he’s not read any of it, but I’ve read some, we changed our bank accounts and set them up how he did, but if my partner ever sees money in any of the accounts, he spends it. It’s an issue I don’t know how to handle, especially since he’s the only income earner and although we’ve made it very clear in our relationship that we share money, what’s mine is ours sort of deal, it doesn’t seem fair for me to tell him he’s not allowed to spend that money. All the accounts have been drained. So long as he has access and can transfer money in an instant through his phone, it may as well be all in one single account."

It’s not hindering me at all. I’ve managed to receive the correct therapies after being diagnosed, the best being DBT (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy) I was very unwell for years and got to a point where normal therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy were no longer useful, I was scared and confused. I self medicated with pot for a while and shut everyone out, because nobody could possibly understand. Then when I quit pot everything came out and I hit rock bottom, wound up in a psych unit because I was actively harming and trying to kill myself and couldn’t be left alone. 

I was diagnosed and felt relief, I finally had a name I could use to find the right treatment, find others like me that I can share things with and have them understand and validate me. I could look at it and go “I have x problem and this is how I can treat it”. I’ve had many people tell me to ignore my diagnosis and not to label things, but having a diagnoses has brought me a lot of freedom. I don’t sit there and think I can’t to this because I’m unwell. I try to do things and if I can’t I understand why. I 100% believe I’ll work again, I 100% believe I am capable of being happy (I’ve found true happiness within myself again after a long time of numbness) because of my diagnosis I was able to fight this head on and continue to kick it’s ass every day. I’m studying, 6 months ago I couldn’t leave the house alone and now I’m studying and desperate for COVID 19 to fuck off so I can have my social life back.

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fp012a2,t3_gae3ij,1588200494.0,"It’s really no wonder she has so many issues today that revolve around giving Carly away. She was still in her formative years and people were telling her she was the worst person ever for giving her baby away.

Cate knew it was the best thing for Carly to put her up for adoption and give her a chance at life that she never had. She did the best thing for Carly, yet her parents, the main adult figures in her life that were her examples to look up to and seek approval from, they told her it was the worst thing she ever did and she was a bad mum for doing so. 

A lot of people won’t understand this, but being subjected to that kind of mental abuse at that age will tend to shape who you are as an adult. 

I was abused by family as a child, mentally physically and sexually. I was also mentally and sexually abused as a teen by my ex. Now logically I know I am a good person, I am a very kind and caring person, I am useful in many ways and I am intelligent in a few areas. However when I am suffering a mental health episode, I truly believe I am the worst person ever, I’m dumb, I’m ugly, I’m worthless. These are all things I was told by people I looked up to in my formative years, people I couldn’t escape from, I had to live with my parents and accept what they said was true. As soon as I could leave I did, but boy am I messed up from it.

I think Cate has done well to recognise when she is in a bad state and requires help. That takes a lot of strength to be able to do. I believe she is strong for seeking help and trying to fight her mental illness head on. I do believe she could be doing more once she is home in order to continue her treatment and exercises, however I have and am currently in the same position and it is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. Find the strength to carry on and be motivated when you feel you have no real purpose in life. Everyday is a struggle for me and I assume it is a struggle for Cate as well.

It’s even harder when you keep your past abusers in your life. You may say “well fuck them, get rid of them then!” Getting rid of family is much harder than you think. Stockholm syndrome is a very real thing and it applies to after abuse as well. You love and are attached to those who abused you. Although they inflicted some of the worst pain upon you, getting rid of thin can be as painful if not worse. 

I hope some people can see this and be a little more sympathetic towards Cate, she’s never really done anything wrong, she’s just very lost and needs support, definitely not to be enabled, but she needs support."

Unfortunately this kind of stuff happens.

My nan gave up 5 of her kids before moving across to the other side of the country, settling down and having my dad and his 2 sisters. She never wanted anything to do with her other kids, barely wanted anything to do with the 3 she kept. Eventually 2 of the kids she gave up tracked her down and moved across the country to stay with my dads family. My nan disowned them when she found out the woman was a lesbian, her brother left with her and they never spoke to my dad’s family again. 
I think my dad may be in contact with them, I’m unsure, I know one of his siblings found him on Facebook about 6 years ago and he went and visited them and maybe some other siblings in their state, I’m even friends with my estranged cousins and Aunty on Facebook. 

My Nan is very unhappy about it and still refuses to admit they’re her children “must be my sister’s kids” my dad barely speaks to my nan anymore because of the person she is. 

You’re not the asshole here, your mum is the asshole. Even if she wants nothing to do with her daughter, it doesn’t mean you can’t have anything to do with your sister. I’m assuming you are an adult. Your mum doesn’t make decisions for you anymore, you’re free to make your own. If you have a bond and connection with your sister, don’t give that up just because your mum doesn’t. 

Your mum probably feels bad, but doesn’t want to admit it, so she is projecting her guilt onto you."
relationships,fmdrbfi,t3_fu7lbe,1585975563.0,"I am so sorry to read about your horribly traumatic experiences with your father. 

Try not to be angry at you mum, I know it’s hard, but she is a victim of domestic abuse, it may not necessarily be naivety and that she is fine with living the way she does. As someone who has been in an abusive relationship, I was made to believe that I wasn’t worthy of his love, but that he gave it to me anyway, I would never find anyone else because he had “defiled me” and made me “impure” and undesirable. I was made to feel like the abuse was my fault and that I deserved it. It is an extremely hard way of thinking to get rid of.

She is most likely too scared to leave, more than she is too naive. She is holding onto her faith as it will make her feel a sense of control, “it’s okay because this is what god wants for me and my faith in god will lead me to heaven”. 

I would try to show your mum as much support as you can, show her love and caring is what she deserves. If you can find time away from your dad, in a soothing calm tone tell her that how he treats her is not okay, that she deserves better and can do better. Tell her this is not about him, but her, she can be happy on her own and that she will not be alone as she will have you and your brothers there to support her. Tell her you understand that he is all she’s known, but that he isn’t treating her how she should be treated. Yes he is nice at times, but he should be nice at all times. 

This may not work straight away or at all, but support your mother, she needs someone to tell her she is worth being loved and she is loved so much by all her children, and that you all will love her more than he ever will. Continue to support her and love her, comfort her and let her know it is okay to leave if she wants to and that you will always be there for her no matter what.

As for your father, I would suggest trying to distance yourself from him and standing up to him. Don’t engage. The best thing that I learnt to do with my abusive father is to just not engage or raise my voice back at him. It is what he wanted, so I didn’t give it to him. Do things for yourself and for your mother and leave him to do his own shit. It is incredibly difficult, but take his power away. You are an adult, you don’t have to do what he says. Yes respect his house and pick up after yourself etc. but stop doing his ironing and cleaning up after him. If he tries to start an argument, walk away m, disengage. 

I hope this helps."

This poor sweetheart Jessie Cate, murdered at 15 years old. She was murdered by her older sister’s 19yo ex boyfriend. She was picked up by Kyle at a bus stop after her shift at a grocery store.

Kyle then drove Jessie to a remote bushland and buried her body in a shallow grave. Upon autopsy it was found that Jessie was still alive at the time of being buried. Kyle plead guilty to murdering Jessie, but has never given a reason as to why. 

Jessie’s boyfriend was one of my friends, I remember the night she went missing, he posted on Facebook to see if people could help him search for her or even just keep a look out. Kyle (murderer) had called Jessie’s mum to tell her that he had picked Jessie up from work to drive her home, but then dropped her off at a football field after a disagreement. Everything was very strange and out of character for Jessie. I remember sharing a missing persons post on Facebook about her. My friend was driving around all night looking for his girlfriend, even though he didn’t have a license. The police took the case on as a missing persons case after only 12 hours as it was so out of character for Jessie. Kyle was arrested and interrogated 2 days after Jessie went missing, he confessed to killing her, but gave no reason."

Hear me out, I’m not a germaphobe or anything. I think it’s great you’re at least getting him to rinse his plate (my 24 year old partner still struggles with the concept) I just worry this could develop into a bad habit. Like I said, my partner struggles with the concept of washing up, in the sense that he’ll use food soaked cloths the wash dishes, icey cold water and washes the dirtiest dishes first making it so he’s washing dishes with food basically. When I grab dishes that he’s “washed” I can feel a greasy slimy film still in them and have to re-wash them myself. 

I’m mentioning all of this because this one action of simply just finding his plate instead of washing, could lead to bad habits, he may start to think it’s okay to just use water and no soap for other dishes that have been used for just a light snack. 

ESH because you and your wife could be teaching your son a bit better habits with washing up and your sister is overreacting with her comments. Also I understand she is a guest in YOUR house and should respect the way you do things, but also she is a GUEST and you should respect her too."

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fjxxuk5,t1_fjx2pjd,1583685827.0,"I agree with you so much about Catelynn. In November 2018 I ended up being admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to a severe mental breakdown stemming from depression a C-PTSD. Catelynn has been through a shit tonne in her life, look at what we do know about her upbringing and think about what stuff has potentially happened off camera that we don’t know. Going away for treatment for mental health is a real and valid thing. I felt awful and guilty leaving my partner and my cat, but it was the best thing for me, I was away for a month and it helped me heal. I can’t imagine how guilty Catelynn must have felt leaving her husband and daughter to seek treatment, but she must have really needed it. 

I remember when I was in hospital getting treatment, my partner said it was like I was on vacation and at a hotel (buffet food and cleaners etc.) but I quickly corrected him, it was hell, I hated being away from home, I was there because I was sick, I wanted to be at home but I needed to heal. It wasn’t a vacation I was working very hard through some very difficult things, I was in group therapies working through painful things. It wasn’t easy at all and far from a vacation. I wouldn’t want my worst enemy to have to go through anything like that month I went to. The place was lovely, I had round the clock support, but that’s because I was in suicide watch, which I couldn’t be at home. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that Catelynn wasn’t on vacation, it wasn’t a spa retreat, it was treatment and therapy. The brain is the slowest part of the body to heal. Being in a treatment centre or psychiatric facility/hospital is like someone going through physical therapy to learn how to walk again, but it’s for your brain and to learn how to function again or for the first time. Catelynn did the right thing by herself and her family by seeking treatment. It’s so easy to judge people if you’ve never experienced what they’ve experienced."

You have no idea why he gained the weight, it could be medical, psychological, who knows. It’s not your place to prod and poke and ask why. He knows how he used to look, he knows he gained weight, he is most likely very embarrassed and self conscious about it and although he doesn’t go to the gym with the rest of you, he’s probably working on it privately. 

I’m speaking as someone who has slowly gained 35kg over the past 8 years. I’ve tried very hard to lose the weight at times and it has caused so much emotional pain for me. I am classed as obese. I genuinely have a thyroid condition that effects my hormones, making it easy to put on weight and near impossible to lose weight. I’ve tried dieting exercising, personal trainers and even medications, I eat less and healthier than my partner who is a twig eats and I still gain weight. There’s one medication that seems to work and it costs $400Aud a month! I have also been on a lot of medications for my mental health that has made me put on mass amounts of weight, I have come off a lot of them to help with my weight.

One day when my partners mum and ex were visiting I showed them some old photos of me and my partners ex step dad mentioned how I was so thin back then and “what happened?” I was crushed, I already knew this, I’m aware of my size, I look in the mirror every day and it brings tears to my eyes. I can’t fit into a lot of my clothes that I love, I feel like I look like Shrek. I’m disgusted in myself, I don’t see what my partner sees in me. I feel hideous. I try SO fucking hard to lose the weight and nothing happens. I even have a fatty liver now, but I eat so healthy! 

It broke my heart when my partners ex stepdad said what he said, if someone I just recently became friends with asked me that, I’d play it down and say it’s okay don’t worry about it. But I would feel dead inside. You don’t know what he’s been going through, you can’t ask those kinds of things. It seems you are very judgemental about his weight. Teasing him isn’t okay, even though you don’t have bad intentions and you’re being playful, it’s not okay. He doesn’t say anything because he feels like shit and feels like he deserves it, you’re crushing this poor man’s self esteem! 

You need to stop the teasing, you need to apologise to him profusely and make it up to him. You need to realise that what you did was definitely wrong and such an asshole move, even if it wasn’t intentional. The good thing about life is that we learn from our mistakes. Learn from this. This is your chance to change your behaviour. Not everyone is the same, everyone gains and loses weight differently and for different reasons. Just be supportive, be supportive of him and his lifestyle, don’t make comments about his weight unless he brings it up and then try suggesting some helpful strategies. If he doesn’t talk about it don’t bring it up."

It doesn’t matter if someone has cancer, if they only want you for your money then they’re the asshole. From what you’ve written here I gather that they didn’t say they wanted to make amends, that they regret the way they treated you and wanted a better relationship with you before they die. She doesn’t want a relationship with her son, she wants money for her illness. She hasn’t even apologised in an attempt to get money from you. Not that I would give her money even if she did. You don’t owe anyone anything. One thing my mum always told me was that children don’t owe their parents anything and parents should never act like they’re owed anything. 

You girlfriend may know the full situation, though she may not fully understand. Cancer is a sore spot for many people and we are made to feel like every cancer patient is an angel who deserves the world. It tends to cloud people’s judgement. People with cancer can still be assholes not deserving of much.
