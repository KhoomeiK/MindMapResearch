AskReddit,fr612s9,t3_gmlkr7,1589918053.0,"I applied to an arts boarding school when I was 15. I got there and the orientation was a 10-day backpacking trip in the colorado wilderness without toilet paper or clothing, carrying 60 pounds on my back. It was not an arts school. I was a 105-pound, 5-foot-tall, city girl who had never experienced snow before. On day one we got a tutorial on how to dig catholes and I knew I literally could not go back!!! Apparently my year had been the second-worse in the school’s history for weather. The trip itself has caused some great damage to me mentally but led to me becoming a very proficient outdoorswoman in years to come with shorter, less traumatic trips."

For the month we were both there we went about our business and said hi when we saw eachother. The time came to leave, we got our phones back, and we followed eachother on Instagram. 

Fast forward to my senior year of high school almost 4 years later; I was touring some colleges and while in a small Connecticut airport, waiting to board my flight, I heard somebody call my name. He RECOGNIZED ME after all that time (and puberty lol). We caught up a little. It was absolutely wild."

Greysexuality,fikn4np,t3_f7k2rx,1582483487.0,"One thing that I’ve learned about greysexuality is that because it is so foreign to a lot of people, it’s better to collect resources. Like, I collect asexual memes, and when people ask me about it, I just let them go ham on my meme collection. Because greysexuality is so subjective, no one greysexual has quite the same experience, sexual-feelings wise, as another. So just give people the basic rundown and then elaborate with personal examples. 


However it is important to note that you don’t *have* to do anything— you’re not the ambassador of asexuality, you’re not required to make people understand it, and you’re definitely not required to talk about what it is to you personally. It’s such a huge misconception in this community that we are all obligated to talk about our sexuality for the sake of spreading awareness. We’re not! It’s your business. And if you don’t want to get nitty gritty about it, tell people to look it up. Because the internet exists."
