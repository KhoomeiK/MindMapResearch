ac_newhorizons,flbh7bm,t1_flbfpop,1585004561.0,Thank you! I heard someone say all white wind-flowers gave them blue. Do they also have a chance of making purple or are the blue and purple windflowers just the same?
AskMen,fl9jgq2,t3_fnckzj,1584958510.0,"I’ve been in a similar situation except I was the attached one. In this case, things need to end. Be as honest as possible, and make sure to be clear that it’s over, do not imply something could possibly happen in the future. As the person who was on the receiving end of that it fucked me up for a long time.

Alternatively, if the idea of completely shutting down a relationship with her in the future is difficult, I’d say maybe consider what feelings you have for her and giving a more serious relationship a chance."

It was honestly the best thing that could have happened to me because I got to a point where I realized what little I could find on social media wouldn’t give me the dopamine boost I wanted. After a couple weeks I got bored, lost all interest completely, and moved on with my life, which seemed impossible at first considering how painful it was."

BPD,f1agkfa,t3_d8amfw,1569293422.0,"Have you looked into applying for disability accommodations at your school? I'm not sure how different it is elsewhere but for me I can get deadline, attendance, test, and note-taking (depending on the class, another student uploads their notes and I'm able to access them) accommodations and it helps significantly. Also if you haven't already, making an appointment with school counseling services will probably help. 

Also, I got to a point like this last semester and I realized if I didn't do something I was going to at the very least fail my classes and worst case put my life at risk, so I was able to withdraw from the semester and get a refund due to it being an extenuating circumstance. If all else fails this should be an option, and remember, you aren't a failure. I know how difficult it can be to get through classes when dealing with BPD, and anyone who invalidates that struggle is just ignorant."

asktransgender,ez1f194,t1_ez0ryt9,1567647350.0,"It’s all good! Honestly I do agree it’s important to emphasize. There’s too many instances of much more privileged people discussing issues that marginalized people go through while completely ignoring and belittling the actual views and thoughts of people from said marginalized groups. 

Also of course and thank you!"
asktransgender,ez0qrxu,t1_ez0my8w,1567640628.0,">This is why discussion about trans people and what we should do really do need to be had by trans people. We are the ones who actually understand what being trans is like. This isn't to say that cis people can't inquire and contribute to the discussion but, really, cis people need to fuck off when it comes to discussion about how trans people should live. No offense, but yeah.

I definitely understand this and don't mean to dictate in any way how trans people should live. I know it's disrespectful when cis people think trans people owe them an explanation for their existence. Regardless of any answer I get I still believe all trans people are valid and really just want to educate myself as much as possible."

SandersForPresident,ewesbbt,t1_ewemnho,1565335582.0,"I mean defending Charles Murray on the Sam Harris episode. Tim Pool worried about policies that call for racial equality like the Green New Deal. Anthony Cumia defending Gavin McInnes...one of the top comments on a clip from that episode is ""It's okay to be white"" and that's not rare to see among Rogan fans. I do also think even when not explicitly talking about it on the show, being friendly with guests who have a tendency to spout white nationalist talking points also falls under normalizing it. If he's gonna do that he should at the very least have more ""SJW"" people on. I do think he's been getting better with that by having Dr. Cornel West and Bernie on."
SandersForPresident,ewehij0,t1_ewcpkru,1565324259.0,"It really is a problem though when his podcast normalizes bigoted talking points like white-nationalism, transphobia, etc. Even worse knowing that when he did have someone on that was pro-trans (Adam Conover) he seemed to push back more than he ever does for the ultra right leaning guests."
cscareerquestions,etjiu5c,t1_ethc37h,1562874506.0,"Powerful capitalist countries have the power they do because of taking advantage of these less powerful countries, which is a large factor into how these countries became more oppressive. Look into world-systems theory, and for actual well-known examples look into western intervention in Cuba, Iran, Algeria, and well...Mexico obviously."
cscareerquestions,etjhzw6,t1_eth1ufw,1562874011.0,"Even if most people are better off than they would have been centuries ago, that's not a valid justification of any injustice going on right now. Capitalism is based entirely on paying people less than their labor is worth in order to make a profit, that's what people mean by saying it's inherently evil, not to mention it's use of slavery and colonization in order to become as powerful as it has.  It's also easy to say things aren't that bad when you're not someone who's living among the extremely poor and marginalized.

I feel this a lot, but honestly remember that there is a huge emerging group of people who are becoming more conscious of how inherently flawed capitalism is. I definitely feel like this a lot and lose motivation, but overall it gives me hope that things are changing for the better and being involved with that gives me a purpose."
