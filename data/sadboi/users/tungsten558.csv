AskReddit,fmncn6z,t3_fvzqic,1586223056.0,"I was once on a date with someone I’d matched with on Tinder, and for precautionary measures, I had stalked his Facebook beforehand to ensure he wasn’t a catfish/complete psycho.

Cut to about an hour or so into the date, I whip out my phone to look up movie timings (we wanted to go see the new X-Men) and he’s greeted with a safari tab open to his Facebook profile. To make matters worse, my phone froze at this time so we were staring at my obvious stalking for a good few seconds before I could change the page.

Needless to say, there wasn’t a second date, although we did still end up going to see the movie."

it would be really nice for someone to just say ""hey, good job"" which isn't in direct response to me sharing my achievement. i feel like i go so out of my way to celebrate others' achievements and bring it up whenever possible so they can feel empowered and positively reinforced, but i guess i might be asking for too much."

depression,fd6lnvj,t3_cml6ni,1578192818.0,"Not to sound like a stereotype, but the only way i've managed to get myself to sleep the past few nights is by crying myself to sleep. 

It worries me, but whenever I bring up my emotions to those around me, I immediately feel like they're invalidated or I feel like a burden for bringing it up in the first place. 

It's a shame I feel like this, because on paper I have it all - a roof over my head, supportive parents, a promising degree, a loving boyfriend and some really incredible friends, but if I'm honest none of these things truly make me feel better about myself. 

I have a therapist but I struggle to even be truly honest with her. I'm not sure why I feel like I have to maintain appearances with her. I guess I'm scared to disappoint her, or that she'll realize that there isn't actually an objective problem with my current life, and cut the sessions we have together. An irrational fear, I know. 

I have a personal journal, but there's something about shouting this all into the internet void that's more cathartic."

AskReddit,esim5fr,t3_c7qrz4,1562016123.0,"I’m a medical student who had a year long weekly placement on psychiatric wards. 

One day, after leaving the wards and making my way to the train station, I heard somebody calling after me, saying “pretty lady.” I live in a very big city and street harassment is (unfortunately) a common thing, so I just put my headphones in and walked a bit faster. 

A few seconds later, the calls became quite indignant and I heard footsteps quicken on their approach to me. Mind, I had physically left the perimeter of the hospital now, the only path to safety was turning back and facing my pursuer.

He came up right alongside me and said something something along the lines of
 
“pretty lady pretty lady stop! There could be dangerous men around here you have to be careful this is a bad area”

I started to feel quite unsafe at this point but I’ve only ever learned to ignore this sort of behavior which seemed to annoy him further until he said 

“I’m one of the nice ones! But if you keep ignoring me I could be not so nice” 

It was at this moment that I basically shit myself because he had kind of got in front of me and then flashed what looked like the tip of a blade from his pocket 

THANKFULLY, whilst I was physically outside of the hospital grounds I was still in view, and two burly police women immediately were there and apprehended him. It was revealed to me that he had schizoaffective disorder and was currently AWOL from the wards. The knife was later found to be a butter knife, but was still terrifying to be in that situation and wonder if those were going to be your last moments!"
