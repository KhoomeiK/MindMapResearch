SelfHarmScars,fnc5tqe,t1_fnan6ox,1586829246.0,Hey if either of you need any support or would like the users banned from this subreddit them please feel free to reach out as you should not have to go through that
SelfHarmScars,fnc4oya,t3_g0n9fh,1586828561.0,"Hey, a mod here,

Firstly, I’m terribly sorry that you’ve had to deal with that in this community. Especially one where we base so much support from, we want the to be a safe space and things like this should not be happening under any circumstances, it’s awful that you have to deal with this.

Secondly, please feel free to message me or anyone else on the moderator team details of these horrible incidents with any proof you may have, in order that we can look into it and take appropriate action, which if true will most likely result in a permanent ban from the subreddit, do not worry about how bad the incident may seem, even if it may be nothing, if it offends you or creeps you out then please do not hesitate to contact us. I know that it isn’t easy though but please don’t let that stop you. We have both female and male moderators of the subreddit so if you would prefer to talk to either sex then please request so.

Furthermore it will be completely anonymous so the creep/ pervert will not know you reported it and so will have no reason to go after you. And this is all in general not just on this specific post.

Finally, this is a topic we as a moderator team are discussing currently as we all feel frankly disgusted by these sort of actions, we do not want to let a couple creeps spoil the wonderful community we have going. We are planning immediate action which we plan to fully implement in the coming days, we have seen this issue and are planning ways to combat it.

I would once again like to apologise and offer my assistance to anyone with anything they may need.

And right fair enough, that sucks and being stuck alone doesn’t help with dissociation sorry to hear that bud. EMDR has been great for me, as my doctor has not only helped me cope when I’m down but is actively dealing with my trauma and desensitising me to it, we’ve done the smaller stuff so far, and it’s scary but 100% worth it, I can think of some traumatic memories and not have a panic or anxiety attack. I’d say it’s worth it if you can get it, maybe get your psychologist to refer you or smth that way it’s coming from a professional which in his eyes is probably more trustworthy, no offence obvs but I’ve been there and it sucks and they never trust ya. Emotional flashbacks really really suck so bad as you feel so fuckin helpless, but hey your psychologist is back in two weeks so that’s good, not too much longer left"
