When me and my ex were looking to buy, we found the perfect house but it was just out of price range.

I have never, ever, been more grateful. That blessed woman helped us out until we had saved up, and we were in a position to offer to buy the house from her.

nothingeverhappens,fglrpjh,t1_fgl763g,1580909215.0,"I had a fantastic science teacher in school. She engaged every single one of us (it was a really rough school) regardless of ability. She made me love science. 

Turns out she was having an “affair” with not only the art teacher, but also sending nudes and explicit messages to a few lads in her classes. 

She could’ve changed lives. We all grew up poor, nobody expected much from us, a lot of us had absent/drunk/drugged up parents, our school had a piss poor reputation and low exam results. She came to our school when I was in year 10 (14/15). Her science classes inspired one girl to become a biomedical scientist, many of us went on to study the sciences. 

On a side note - she was not the only teacher that got arrested. The school also got closed down when I was 16, just after I left. It’s now been knocked down, too."

AmIBeingTooSensitive,fgiqvs6,t3_eyea06,1580828873.0,"As someone who has also had a “friend” constantly mention my lack of boobs (she is no longer a friend for various reasons) I can say the only way to solve it, for me, was to tell her straight she was making me uncomfortable. I said something along the lines of “I’ve just learnt how to be comfortable with my own body, I would appreciate you keeping your opinions about it to yourself, unless you feel something you see is detrimental to my health.” 

She sulked first a while, acted offended because it was “just a joke,” but I told her I didn’t see it as such. She made one more comment a few weeks later, where I (slightly ashamed of the overreaction) told her I’d dump my coffee on her if she finished that sentence with anything to do with my boobs, and then I heard nothing else regarding it. 

You’re not being too sensitive, but I recommend telling your friend bluntly to stop."

INFO: let’s say you go on this course, spend your 15k+ expenses. You come back, it’s been great. You’ve used your severance pay and unemployment  on this. 

Now you return home. You’re trying to set up home with hubby. That’s expensive. God forbid, the job market is shocking, you don’t find work. You keep applying, but nothing. 3 months, 6 months. Do you still have enough money to contribute to your household? To pay travel/car, rent/mortgage, utilities, emergencies? In a years time, will you be glad you dropped 20k on a hobby, or wish you’d saved it because there’s no jobs and you have no income? Or will you expect new hubby to bankroll you until you find something? 

You need a contingency plan. Long term stability is more important than short term gratification."
