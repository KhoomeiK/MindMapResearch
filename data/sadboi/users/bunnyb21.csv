Yes you need to apologize, but also explain what led to your actions. Tell him about the trigger and your past relationship. You're not physically abusive if you have only done this one time and if you are actively trying to make sure it doesn't happen again. Your bf should be able to respect that you had a trigger and that it was an accident. If not, move on, and don't blame yourself too much."

You can't possibly spend every minute with her and your needs need to be met too. Those are her feelings, and whether they are wrong or right, they are still valid. You also have feelings that are important and valid. This just sounds like communication is needed, boundary setting, and compromising. Reassure her, but also state what you need. 

I love spending time with my husband, but I also like my alone time and that doesn't mean i don't want to be around him. It just means that I need to take care of my needs. My husband and I usually go to bed at the same time, but it's helpful because we have the same bedtime (11 or 12)."

When you come to this realization, it is like grieving, because you're losing and letting go of the hope that your parent will never be what you need. You just now lost someone and it is okay to grieve over the loss and take time to heal and separate yourself from them."

Self-compassion. My dietician told me that I needed to be more compassionate to myself. When my body isn‚Äôt doing what I want it to do ( for example, my body is in pain but I want to go to the gym anyways), I have to listen to my body and acknowledge that my body needs rest, or food etc. Being more compassionate to my body‚Äôs voice and needs, I have started developing self-love. And it doesn‚Äôt just have to be your body, but your mind as well. Listen to your body, tune in to what it‚Äôs saying. 

I think that has helped me the most, good luck on your journey ‚ù§Ô∏è"

I‚Äôve actually lived with my husband before, but last year I was sick and couldn‚Äôt work so my parents let us share rent with them and move in to their rental house for a year ( I wish I hadn‚Äôt gone back to my mom for help). My husband is amazing and is the best support I‚Äôve ever had and so living with him is extremely helpful. Move in is complete but we are missing some furniture around the apartment and so I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù yet. 
Any advice I have about moving in with a partner is to keep up communication. Like if you have a problem, talk about it to your partner ASAP. And talk about splitting up chores and how money is going to work for you guys. I was blessed to have my partner who excels at communication so he taught me a lot."

I recently just moved out of that house I was living in with her and now am in my apartment that I share with my husband.  All this moving has caused me to push myself too hard to get things done (even though I have a back injury) and it seems like I forget to keep in check with my body and end up doing way more than I am physically capable of.
