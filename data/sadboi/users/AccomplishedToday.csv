I agree. Morality is based on the individuals values. Ethics is based on 'universally' shared values. The philosophical question of what, how long, where, when, is it valid, and why the ethical system is formed could be an interesting debate.

The advice that I constantly give myself when things feel so rough that I don't feel as if I can move forward is.... ""Grow up."" Not in an invalidating way but more of ""I need to put on my 'I'm an adult' hat and goggles""

Good news is, you are in control of your behaviors and thoughts. Dream up the adult you look up to in your mind. Label the attributes that you admire in that adult. Then strive to grow into those attributes. Remember, be kind to yourself. Meaningful growth takes time, commitment, and willpower.

This isn't going to help you ""out of a depressive mindset."" There's no easy fix. Something that may seem like it's 'fixed' always has the potential to resurface later, sometimes in different forms.

To summarize:
You can influence your behaviors and thoughts. You are not in full control of your emotions (no one is.) Learning skills to influence behaviors and thoughts will support and influence your emotions.

Keep a mood journal

Track a behavior that you want to start/stop

Practice breaking a pattern (""Oh, I'm being very critical on myself."")

What you can do right now to improve your situation

- Stop all harmful addictive substances (alcohol, harder drugs, [I had to quit caffeine for a time]). They will only continue to make your moods and behaviors worse.
- Note when you started feeling this way (recently) and what behaviors made it worse or better
- If you are struggling with thoughts of self-harm, death, or suicide then please talk to your doctor, call a helpline, ... just talk to a professional. Friends and online strangers help but those are signs that are not to be ignored.
- Exercise. Helps a lot with sleep and appetite.

There are many people who wouldn't mind exploiting children if it were socially acceptable. These are the same people who don't mind exploiting 'college kids'.

Therapy

Responsibility is psychological ownership.

Being too sick to improve living means an approach to death.

That is up to you. It's your life and your boundaries.

> Does someone know more places online to talk about this?

Instead of focusing on the Bipolar aspect of your dad, focus on yourself and what you are going through.

This is IRL: I highly recommend therapy for both parties. You are dealing with a heavy burden at a difficult time in your life. Having a professional to talk to will help the transition to a better life immensely."

You have three roads in front of you

- Continue playing the games as described in this post

- Move on

- Ask the guy out to coffee, have a conversation (Listen first (about 60% of the convo at least) then talk!), and be honest.

I feel similarly when switching therapists. The therapists that 'click' with me tend to not take as much time providing help."

The reason HR was originally designated with the responsibility of recruiting was to holistically grow a culture.

There are alternative ways to collaborate with your dad. You fucked up the relationship by violating the confidentiality of the conversation. What does that communicate to your dad what you think and feel about the relationship?
