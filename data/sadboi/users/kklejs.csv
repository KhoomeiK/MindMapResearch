BPD,f1awlzq,t3_d8fqre,1569311111.0,Constantly! Im currently going through a breakup so this feeling is so intensified.. maybe it’s our brains coping mechanism
BPD,f08p8zu,t1_f05cjdd,1568485181.0,Yup often I think it actually comes from trauma
BPD,f08o5og,t1_f00usc4,1568484585.0,Yes..
BPD,f08o0fo,t1_f02jlxl,1568484508.0,Yes... but I’ve never met another person with bpd irl that I know off
BPDmemes,f0811qw,t3_d3hytn,1568473026.0,OMG ALL THE TIME WITH MY EX..... and when he left me (in a very bad way and acted terribly during and after the breakup) I even ended up comforting him about that too....
BPDmemes,f07ywwt,t3_d3yzkw,1568471776.0,I actually believed my first FP/ boyfriend of 4 years when he said this.. NEVER AGAIN...
BPDmemes,f0727k3,t3_d3xlpm,1568451106.0,Yup yup yup
BPD,f021pjm,t1_ezpqo39,1568321977.0,"And I’m sorry for the bad grammar, I’m from Denmark"
BPD,f021evn,t1_ezpqo39,1568321841.0,"Yea I was very  very recently diagnosed with BPD (don’t have a therapist yet only a psychiatrist who’s described me anti depressants and put me on the waiting list for a bpd-therapist) 

And you are spot on, I’m so hyper focused on my behaviour and will blame myself badly and feel so shameful if I act out the slightest. (Im the person who apologises A LOT, even when it isn’t my fault I just  apologise for being sad) 
But I haven’t acted out, I haven’t yelled or started an argument, even when he’s been pushing and crossing my lines and behaving really poorly. All I do is try to make him see that he’s making a mistake, but I’m trying to stop. 
It’s like I’m addicted to acting like things are fine for a little while. For example: I’ll ask him to come over and discuss the situation about the animals or the apartment and then he’ll tell me about his day and we’ll watch some tv and laugh about the same things and play with the animals and then everything seems normal again, but then when he leaves it’s like being broken up with all over again..  and being left again and realise that he don’t want me anymore, again... 
it’s like self torture and I want to stop. 
At the end of the day it is probably because I find it hard to accept my feelings of disappointment, rejection and sadness. I keep reading the sentence you wrote “I’m not over him, accept it for what it is” and that actually helps me.. 

About the no contact rule, did you tell him that you were gonna do that? And if so - how? 

Again thank you so much, your replies have been a big help thank you for the time and energy you’ve put into them. I hope the breakup you are going through ends up being a good thing for you further down the line. ❤️"
BPD,ezp3amw,t1_ezlndqy,1568032088.0,"Thank u so much! I can’t begin to explain how much your reply means to me and I’ve been reading it again and again since yesterday. I have an issue that I haven’t really expressed clearly and maybe you can give some advice. Because everything you’ve written has been a big help, but what keeps pulling me down is that - I feel like everything I do is, in the back of my head, an attempt to get him to come back, whether that’s trying : no contact or too much contact or hanging out with my friends (showing him that I’m a healthy person, even tho I pretty much fucked that completely over this weekend) 
But yea... I just feel like everything I do it’s for him, even if I don’t want it to be..."
BPD,ezlepr0,t1_ez42fi7,1567975793.0,Yup......
BPD,ezj31xj,t1_ezef1g7,1567937760.0,Are you me??? I always feel so empty after a movie and I cry happy tears and sad tears in every movie
BPD,ez60zrf,t3_czwcod,1567707822.0,"Yes.. and i also have a need of being taken care of, because I wasn’t as a child.."
BPD,ez0fsrz,t1_ez0en51,1567636091.0,I hope it’ll get better.. Right now it’s all my mind wanders to...
BPD,eyyk9r9,t1_eyyjn0m,1567591755.0,I feel you ....
BPD,eyyk4xr,t3_czhkav,1567591565.0,"Yea. My FP (of almost 4 years) and i broke up 2 and a half weeks ago and I’ve over all been proud of how I’ve dealt with it, at least in front of him, but he’s been really mean in this break up and I think I’ve “split” on him for good (I know there were good times I just don’t think he’s worth it anymore). I’m more depressed because it has been a trigger because I’m dealing with it alone and have made me think about how no one was there for me in my childhood and all the trauma and abuse.. now I find myself thinking about sex and alcohol a lot.... (I’ve done drugs and been promiscuous before but I didn’t know at the time that it was coping mechanisms) and now, even tho I can identify it, I can’t stop thinking about wanting to do it, and yea I definitely think it’s some desperate attempt to change the situation you’re in, in that moment.."
BPD,eydbuaj,t1_eydbjiy,1567015610.0,Ended* two*   .. and probably more.. (I’m from Denmark)
BPD,eydbjiy,t1_eycrn8k,1567015411.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to read it all and to give such a good reply. It means a lot. 
I’m sorry about your mother, it’s an indescribable pain to not have that bond and when they never fulfil their role as the parent. 
I have few friends, but I end up feeling like a burden because I’m so broken right now and I feel like I need a lot of comfort and it hurts me so much when they’ve all suggested to go to my mom/ parents for comfort, because that’s what they do in these kind of situations (they all have really supporting comforting parents)
I think both reasons you have mentioned about why the relationship might end is true. It’s a combination of the too. He had some issues he never mentioned until he broke up for good. I knew he was bad at communicating his feelings, but it was a double edged sword for me because if I asked him too much about how he was feeling he apparently felt like I wanted a certain answer, so he lied. And it pains me because from the bottom of my heart - I’ve always wanted the best for him.. I was always open about my feelings (unless when I split on him I 99,9% of the time kept that to myself because I knew it was just a defence mechanism) 
And so I thought he knew he could always be open with me..
I love love love my cat and dog, but sometimes it’s hard because it’s Our cat and dog, that we got together. And I can feel that they miss their dad. 
I’m very glad to hear someone say that my feelings are valid and that it’s okay to be sad, because I sometimes feel like I should stop being sad, but then it makes it worse.
And you are very right that I should acknowledge that I can’t keep wanting answers our dwelling on the questions, for my own sake. 
Thank you"
