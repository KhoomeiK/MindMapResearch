depression,f5caxt0,t1_f5c94rg,1572132481.0,I get it for sure she was your best friend and every time you were with her it gave you a nice warm feeling inside that everything was all going to be ok and almost at peace with yourself and things in your life it’s hard to get over that but now you can think of you first and what’s best for you to move forward in your life go to that place you’ve always wanted but she wasn’t really feeling it so that thing you wanted to but she wasn’t interested in and with all the dating apps and stuff you can always find another woman to connect with when your ready just do you man I’m sure your awesome and you deserve to be happy just like everyone else don’t let this one hiccup in life stop you from being the best you
depression,f5c69p8,t3_dnkzjt,1572130842.0,It may seem like that now but you just need to hang in there and keep fighting the love of my life left me about 5 years ago I thought she was the one then she txted me one day and broke up with me for no reason maybe she found someone else who knows but it ruined my life for a long long long time and I still think about her from time to time honestly but eventually I found someone else and then she left me and that keeps happening to this day I know it hurts cause you care about her deeply and want to be with her desperately and can’t see past that but there are so many beautiful fun amazing women out there and you will find someone better one day and you can have that feeling of happiness again maybe even stronger don’t give up it’s going to hurt I’m not going to lie for a while probably but one day you will wake up and it will slightly be a little better and day after day it will be a little better and eventually one day you will realize that you haven’t thought about her all day and then weeks will go by without thinking about it and eventually it won’t matter anymore just don’t give up I’m telling you from experience you can do it
depression,f5c3jv2,t3_dnkzjt,1572129875.0,Hey man your not alone every girl I’ve ever liked or fallen for has left me and I get that feeling every-time it happened and I know that exact feeling I’ve been there multiple times you may not believe it now but that feeling passes eventually it will take time but you can do it cause if I can you definitely can if you need to talk I’m here for ya man
