EatingDisorders,fqnzbxm,t3_givw4u,1589504395.0,"Have you ever had an sensory issues? Like feeling weird about certain fabrics, textures, sounds? Any negative experiences where you’ve gotten sick from food, or seen someone else get sick from food? I cannot make a diagnosis based on the information provided of course, but there is something called avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) that came to mind. It’s characterized by avoidance of food due to texture, smell, taste, appearance, or fear of aversive consequences (“if I eat this, I may get sick.” Etc.) 

I also see many ARFID patients who describe themselves as “just not being food motivated people.” For example, they would rather play outside or do other things and seem to have had limited interest in food since they were young. 

This may not be the case for you, as you did not mention it in your post, but the avoidance of eating without any body-image related motives rings a bell."
EatingDisorders,fqnyuio,t3_givvft,1589504120.0,"You need to find a new therapist. I work in an eating disorder treatment center and you absolutely sound like you’re struggling with an eating disorder. 

I’m so sorry you were invalidated in this way. That’s not okay, and it highlights the need for specialists as not all therapists receive the training they need to in eating disorders. 

I recommend checking out the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) website where they have resources to find specialists in your area. If you search “eating disorder therapist” on Psychology Today and enter your zip code, that will also direct you to some providers."
EatingDisorders,fqhgpj3,t3_givuuy,1589376628.0,"A lot of people struggling with binge eating also struggle with restrictive eating. From what it sounds like, she has a history of dieting. She could start by seeing an eating disorder dietitian and an eating disorder therapist virtually, I want to emphasize the specialty as some providers who do not specifically work with eating disorders may worsen the problem. 

Food restriction creates food interest which can turn to food obsession. She can be binging to numb out from emotions as well, but if we address the restrictive dieting piece the binging tends to improve. She should eat every 2-3 hours, including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Psychologically, when we know we are able to be fed as often we need to be, and get to include all foods, they start to feel less alluring over time. If you knew you could have cake every day for the next month without shame or guilt, cake on day 30 would just be cake, whereas on day 1 it is more of a commodity that we are not supposed to be enjoying or have to feel guilty about, which is not helpful. Guilt and shame are really big emotions that can make someone struggling with binging actually binge more."

ScientificNutrition,fdwh2d1,t3_en4gw4,1578758606.0,"I don’t know of a way to measure exactly how much vitamin D you are getting from the sun, and would be interested to learn more. Generally, we recommend 20 minutes per day of shorts/short sleeve exposure in the summer. 

As far as absorption goes, it depends on where you live and the time of year. If you live above 33 degrees latitude (think Atlanta, Georgia on a map of the US, for example) you can’t really synthesize vitamin D from the sun from late fall to early spring. I recommend people take 2,000 IU of vitamin D3 from October to April where I live (Northern Virginia). 

It also depends on your skin tone/ethnicity. Very fair skin makes it easier to absorb vitamin D from the sun, vs. darker skin tones tend to absorb less. Other variables include kidney and liver function, co-occurring diseases, deficiencies, and genetics.
