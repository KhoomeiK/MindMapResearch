I've only ever been on T for 3 months (I had to stop early 2018 because of unsupportive family) and when I'm paying attention, my voice can sound very deep/masculine. It actually sounds a lot deeper spoken than it does in my head to my surprise. It doesn't take much effort because of the way I spoke pre-t; my voice sounded feminine but on the deeper/darker end of the spectrum. Though, sometimes when I'm around people that see me as a girl I subconsciously adjust and speak higher.

I thought constant venting would be annoying, too, but they said it was fine or encouraged it. Like ask me what was wrong and i'd say I don't wanna complain. They said it's not good to bottle up my feelings so I'd just go ahead and vent. I remember very vividly one of them had a meltdown and started calling themselves a failure in my DMs because I said I didn't want to talk about what was bothering me that day :/ I also remember at one point I said I felt I vent too much and wanted to stop/just keep a journal until I could see a therapist and they all told me not to do that. In hindsight I should've not told them and gone with what I thought was best, but I listened. We even had ""venting"" channels in the discord server we were in that everyone used regularly.

Ideally I would've had a therapist before we even became close friends, but my mom pulled me out of it twice and sort of banned me from going for awhile. She gave me the option to see one again earlier this year (albeit while trying her best to discourage it) but at that point I was planning to move. I saw a therapist for a few sessions anyway but it wasn't going well with him so I put it on hold until I moved. I would've kept going but i did let one of them know what was going on in therapy before making the decision to stop and they said it what was happening wasn't normal.

I say I don't remember because I really only complained about my mom or being depressed repeatedly. Other things were the occasional problem and i don't remember them all since they weren't that significant. I do know I don't complain much at all now since getting away and because of that my depression is not nearly as bad. They mostly suggested i get away from her and see a therapist. I couldn't pay for my own therapist because of my mom not letting me work a job under her roof so they knew it wasn't as simple as ""go see a therapist"" or ""move out"" but in the end i did both."

They also say I was a handful 24/7 because they were taking turns watching out for me without me knowing during my suicidal episodes. It wasn't always like this, it seems i only became a burden this past year since it was a really bad year for me, but I destroyed several-years long friendships.

Assistance,f8ulug8,t3_e2bffw,1574833894.0,"I need financial help because I have a doctor's appointment soon. Next monday. I may need an uber if i don't have to pay a 40 dollar copay. I also have regular monthly expenses. I'm a little broke right now and can't afford to pay for them all, and I'm also still job hunting (also need an uber back and forth for interviews)."
therapy,f8uku8f,t3_e2b9or,1574832842.0,"It's not lazy. Lazy people don't want to do x thing, don't do it, and don't feel guilt for not doing it. If you have no motivation for video games and don't feel happy, it sounds like you might have depression, low energy, possibly executive dysfunction. It might be worth it to talk to someone"
trans,f8ukgw9,t1_f8ukds2,1574832459.0,That's a smart idea. Thank you!

AmItheAsshole,f8txkel,t3_e240rq,1574813767.0,YTA for not discussing a compromise with the mother. I get that the baby is close by both if your ex-wife isn't comfortable you need to respect that.
SuicideWatch,f8to0uj,t1_f8ti7iy,1574807553.0,That's reasonable. I doubt there's an afterlife too. I hope there's not one so we could all truly rest one day
SuicideWatch,f8thw8s,t1_f8t20gl,1574803734.0,I see. What do you think about death? Do you believe there's life afterwards?
