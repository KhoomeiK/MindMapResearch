MentalHealthSupport,f3ym7z5,t3_diu890,1571256082.0,"This sounds very similar to how I was about 10 years ago. I was diagnosed with chronic depression / dysthymia. And when you have the big dips they call it double depression.

Having a title and a diagnosis made me feel worse, so did the drugs so I stopped taking them. 

Unfortunately it took a tragic circumstance of one of my friends commuting suicide to give me the confidence to speak out publicly. Everyone swarmed to my sides initially to offer their help. After a while it calmed down and my closest friends have now learned that I don’t need pity or anything like that and they have promised to be there when I ask as long as I’m honest and tell them when I’m struggling.

It’s scary, confusing and utterly exhausting. You may find the professional route better? I found the social support route better. I still struggle but I know I have a safety net whenever I want it.

Whichever way you want to go taking those first steps take so much courage and bravery. 
Don’t be scared to ask for help

I’m always available if you want to let off some steam. Keep safe"
MentalHealthSupport,f3yjg1g,t3_dituzy,1571254901.0,"How to help differs from person to person unfortunately. When I have my major depressive episodes I just want to be alone but that’s not necessarily what I need. My friends have amazingly gotten used to the difference.

If he has reached out to you that he needs help then he has had to be so strong to actually ask. Don’t try and solve or rationalise his thoughts or worries. Listen to him and be with him. Even if it’s just to sit in silence and watch movies all night. Just be with him. 

Years ago I told my friends that when I’m stuck in a pitch black room, I don’t want them to turn on the light for me. I want them to just sit with me until I find the strength to look for the switch myself."
