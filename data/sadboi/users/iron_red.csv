Here are some things I would suggest, if you haven‚Äôt already:

-Ask your landlord for an extension on rent due to pandemic

-Contact both local and federal government officials to see *if* there are financial assistance measures available due to the pandemic
       -Don‚Äôt get discouraged if there are not. I‚Äôm an
         American and our government does not have a
         great record here

-Find a flatmate or sub lettor to help you out with rent. I‚Äôm sure others are in the same position as you being unable to afford a place. Move in with one of them or have them move in with you. 

Coping techniques:

-I like meditation. Headspace is the free app of my choice, but there are many. 

-Take walks outside.

-Play an easy free game on your device of choice

-Keep going to therapy

PS‚ÄîI know it sucks, but losing your flat isn‚Äôt the end of the world.

For example, Ini is 17-18 but still immature / unsure what she wants to do with her life, and David is ~ 20-21 to achieve the same age and maturity gap. That way, John (as the hero) can do do the same violent action on a 21 year old, rather than an 18 y/o fresh outta high school"
