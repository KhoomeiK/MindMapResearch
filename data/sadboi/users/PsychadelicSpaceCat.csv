My skin adjusted a little bit, but basically I had to avoid cleansing the patch around my mouth. Frustrated me for a long time bc BP is such a great acne treatment. I eventually switched to an unmedicated cleanser + a thin layer of 10% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment applied over the whole face (except the mouth and eye areas). If your skin doesn't adjust to the Panoxyl after a while, maybe give that method a shot? It's done the trick for me for years :)"
