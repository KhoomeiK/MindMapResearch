One time I heard her down in the kitchen talking very loudly to the cooks about how bad I was and calling me unnecessary names. I think it was only still my first week so ofc I was still learning and making mistakes. 

The funniest part is that the owner and manager of the establishment couldn’t understand why there turn over rate was so bad,, uh maybe it’s because all of your employees bully the new ones??

I was around 15 years old and lived with my father. He had a decent amount of wooded area surrounding his house and it was always fairly quiet. Our AC didn’t work the best so we usually kept a few windows open at night to keep it cool. One night I had gotten up around 3 a.m. to pee and as I was sitting on the toilet half awake I heard this horrible nightmare-ish human/woman like “screaming” coming from the woods outside the window. I mean it really sounded like the screams of a women being murdered! I was absolutely petrified and ran immediately back to my bed where I then hid under the blankets until I somehow fell back to sleep hahaha

I told my dad about it in the morning and he said there were a few animals like foxes that can make human like screaming noises — 

but to this day I still question it"
