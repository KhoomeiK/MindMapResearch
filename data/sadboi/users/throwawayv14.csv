mentalhealth,foywtwp,t1_fmyepl4,1588180654.0,"I’d always be careful with online services concerning stuff like health, you never know how much of that is being tracked and sold to companies for advertisement

SuicideWatch,fn69rgd,t1_fn69p5v,1586692817.0,"thank uou, I may consider contacting someone from uni who’s sorta like a step below a prof, but he has said he cares before"
SuicideWatch,fn69ivr,t1_fn69ak1,1586692573.0,I’m worried my prof might think of me as crazy or overly fragile afterwards
SuicideWatch,fn699om,t1_fn66fbz,1586692313.0,"As I said it’s a small uni but that also means I know my profs quite wel already, and tbh i don’t think the professor would really care"
