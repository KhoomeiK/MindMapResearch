If it's a very strict firm there are rules to abide by, obviously, but if the dress code is followed properly it should be fine. And we all know how strict and sexist dress codes already affect women, after many girls are sent home from school and shamed and denied access to the classroom because their collarbones might ""distract"" the poor male students."
unpopularopinion,fp1p47k,t1_fp1iixp,1588243277.0,"Again, open proper make up rated information and see why it's done. They're not doing it to attract you. It has nothing to do with biology, and redness out of biological reasons can't be helped.  No one *wants* to attract you.  Women just feel good that way, but you wouldn't believe that,  again, because all you're focused on is how women are trying to get pregnant by  a Chad. 

>how there is no point in arguing with you

Because you're not capable of looking at the logical side of the argument and take a small altered part of it and send an irrelevant link to prove your point. If you didnt want to argue, you wouldnt have bothered to straight up write me a mini (useless) essay. But you did, because you likely have absolutely nothing else going for you in life, now or ever. The words and opinions of a sexist MGTOW psycho have no value in the real world and no power over real people."

No, dude, open a make up tutorial and they explain why. If you're able enough to use the Internet for fake ""facts"" and women-hating garbage, you can Google a YouTube video. Different ""looks"" have different types of make up used for them and different reasons behind them. And most of the time, my dude, it's not done for men. Let women enjoy things and go cry yourself to sleep 

>You are proving more and more how illiterate you are by attacking the Person behind the Argument, thats an Ad Hominem.

No, I'm stating that a person part of a group hating on women and forcing sexist and inaccurate garbage down everyone's throat is gonna be * gasp *....a trash human being with no real understanding of how the world or women work. That's facts. MGTOW and all who support it are garbage. And your ignorant ass isn't worth mine (or anyone's ) time anymore"
