Whistling,fnrc9t8,t3_g07e7s,1587184764.0,"So glad you posted another one of these! I’m sure this sounds weird haha but you seem like a really talented musician just from these, so these videos are always a pleasure to hear :)"
rantgrumps,fnmqxk1,t1_fnc49g2,1587076461.0,"I definitely agree with what you said! Again, I liked it more than some of the previous covers Dan’s done, but your critiques are definitely valid and I had similar thoughts. I’ll be sure to check out that cover album, thanks for sending me the link!"
rantgrumps,fn53t08,t1_fn2usz2,1586655253.0,"I loved the video too, and I agree with your thoughts on the most recent NSP cover album! I also do like his voice with renditions that are more acoustic!"
rantgrumps,fn53q8g,t1_fn2rgjs,1586655202.0,Thank you for saying that! :) I respect that!
rantgrumps,fn53o7n,t1_fn223ge,1586655164.0,Yes!! I totally agree with all of that :)
rantgrumps,fn0zw7r,t1_fn0rdqt,1586552008.0,I’m glad you enjoyed it too! I definitely agree with everything you said 😊
Whistling,fiz1qxu,t3_f8nnar,1582852086.0,"This is so nice to listen to, it’s genuinely relaxing to me! I’m glad you’re posting again in this community- it’s great to hear from you, and I hope you do more “messing around” in the future 😊"
rantgrumps,f7mrucz,t1_f7mipps,1573871839.0,"You’re totally right, on both accounts! Like I mentioned, I really enjoyed listening to Dan’s vocals in that song especially, but there were a few parts where I found it hard to hear as well. Thanks for the comment! :)"
rantgrumps,f7mrrfj,t1_f7mil91,1573871772.0,"That’s fair! Originally I thought Dan/NSP made a good choice in removing the song, but I didn’t know all those details about the documentary. Thanks for commenting!"
tifu,f4i08uc,t3_dj95o8,1571598396.0,"I’m sorry you had to deal with that- I’m glad you got that kind of behavior out of your life! Also, your pun in your edit (“It’s shawl over for you...”) and your picture alone (your eyes are beautiful!) make you a catch all on their own :) Good luck! You’ve got a whole community supporting you!"
Whistling,ey429qs,t3_chf71d,1566779881.0,"You’re a lovely whistler, I really enjoyed this! Hope you’ll post more soon :)"
AskReddit,ey2uyyu,t1_exlmjf3,1566748929.0,I like listening to really good whistlers- do you happen to have any videos uploaded or anything? :)
mentalhealth,eryzx8e,t1_erq2kgf,1561421979.0,"I’m happy to hear that! I normally don’t know what to say in situations like this, so I feel like I run the risk of sounding really cliché lol, but I really appreciate the kind words. I hope you’ve been doing well in the past few days :)"
mentalhealth,erctkh1,t3_c1fbio,1560721595.0,"Unfortunately, mental illness isn’t something that discriminates or goes away- I’m so sorry to hear that you’re struggling again, but please just know that all of your feelings are valid! I can understand being worried about people not believing that your bad thoughts are back again after a period of recovery, but you can’t help your thoughts and feelings, and people who judge you for these kinds of emotions aren’t good for you anyway!"
mentalhealth,er9fcoh,t3_c0yutd,1560622940.0,"I would ignore the other comment that’s posted- you’re not bad or wrong for thinking these thoughts at all. You’re still relatively young, and you’re figuring out your identity (even though it’s a lifelong process!), and it’s okay to not be completely sure of who you are yet! I’m cisgender so I don’t have real experience with what you’re talking about, but I think all your feelings are valid. Is it possible for you to talk to a counselor, or some other trusted adult, about this? 💗"
mentalhealth,er9f1lz,t3_c0yy6x,1560622779.0,"Hi! First of all, I’m incredibly proud of you for even thinking about talking to a trusted adult about what you’re going through. You’re so brave! 💗 If it were me, I would personally email them in advance to set up a meeting (especially due to the nature of the topic- it might be good to mention that it’s a serious topic that could potentially be upsetting), but again, that’s just me! You can do whatever makes you feel comfortable :)
I hope all goes well with your discussion- I’m rooting for you, for sure! If you ever need someone else to talk to, I’m just a message away. Keep up the great work 💗💗"
mentalhealth,er9er3t,t3_c0za6d,1560622625.0,"I’m glad you’re still here, even if I may not know you 💗 I’m really proud of you for doing productive things/knowing what your coping strategies are when those bad feelings are flooding back! You’re strong and brave, and you might have a lot on your plate right now, but I’m genuinely so happy you’re alive. If you ever need to talk to anyone, please message me!"
mentalhealth,er9ejsl,t1_er981zh,1560622517.0,"I’m thinking of you both as I type this reply- I definitely understand how you’re both feeling, but I really appreciate your perspective! I know I feel like I’m at a bit of a standstill at this point in my life, but you’re definitely right in the sense that there are still beautiful things in the world that can make us feel again. I’m wishing you both the best of luck on your journey- you deserve friends and supporters and people in your corner, and if either of you ever need anyone to talk to, I’m just a message away! Keep up the good work 💗"

mentalhealth,er8tswt,t3_c0ty05,1560611596.0,"This made me tear up- I’m so proud of you :) I can’t wait to see the progress you’ve made on this goal, and I know this whole community will support you through it! I’m so glad you’re feeling alive again, it really gives me hope 💗"
mentalhealth,er8tmu3,t3_c0wpd1,1560611500.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that 💗 This is a lot for you to deal with, but I promise it won’t last forever, and I’m proud of you for having the foresight to know who you are and what paths you do and don’t want to take. You are strong and loved, and if you need someone to talk to, I’m just a message away!"
