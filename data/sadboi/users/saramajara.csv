2. I saw a teenager on a bike (black male drug runner) get hit head on by a utility van - on purpose - and drive away without so much as tapping the breaks of hesitating. Then watched as a second car (that had been parked, waiting) pulled up behind the kid, watched as two men got out and robbed the (severely injured / unconscious / dying) kid of his drugs and money, then enter their vehicle and speed away. License plates were covered on both vehicles. I called 911, 20 minutes later when the EMT's arrives, the teenager was deceased.
3. I saw a guy on a dirt bike popping wheelies down the street in traffic, loose control of bike, and slam his unprotected head into a the post of a street / traffic light. There was a very large amount of blood, as he cracked his skull - visible, and very obviously died on impact."

OpiatesRecovery,fiku4kc,t1_fikr4qw,1582487336.0,I disagree. My withdrawal from gabapentin was extremely mild compared to any one of my multiple opiate detox’s
OpiatesRecovery,fikt1rg,t3_f89x2l,1582486743.0,"I think it totally depends on how you define “worse”. And if we are talking about cold turkey withdrawal from a moderate to high dose, or the withdrawal after titrating the dosage to near zero. Does worse mean most dangerous? Most painful? Longest lasting?

I’d consider the withdrawal of a cold turkey jump off a higher long term dosage of methadone to be the “worst”. While the withdrawal after titrating down to 1mg of methadone to be on the easier side.

Cold turkey benzo withdrawal is super dangerous, especially off a high dosage, as well as painful. But for me, not as bad as a CT detox from a nasty heroin-fent IV habit.

I think “worst” is so subjective, you’re never just going to be able to pin down 1 drug, and say “ substance x is THE worst. Period.”

MY worst withdrawal was a forced isolated CT detox from long term high dose heroin-fent and Xanax habit together. Although I imagine jumping off 150mg of methadone would be much “worse”."

I don’t think it’s fair to say methadone is awful, you got on it thinking it would be some magic way to avoid withdrawal. It’s not. 40mg for 4 weeks is not a long time. (Arguably not near long enough to even stabilize your dose) If you want off - start lowering your dose now."

If you don’t know what kind of commitment you’re entering when you get on methadone, and try to jump off, of course it’s going to be horrible. I don’t think it’s methadones fault. Its not magic. It’s your doctors job, and your job to educate yourself about the medication before you start taking it. And This goes for any medication."

IMO stay away from kratom ( its too close feeling like an opiate for me and I end up abusing it to chase a high )

I would try to stop feeling so responsible for her situation, you’re definitely not. She made a whole lot of those decisions on her own, and you can support her recovery without enabling her, or putting yourself at risk.

That said, sometimes rehab isn’t enough or just doesn’t work. I could have gone on a rehab tour of the US with every intention of recovery and still relapse every single time. Secondly, stripping, although understandably upsetting for a mother, isn’t mutually exclusive with being sober, having dignity, and leading a healthy life.

The first thing I would be certain of is her desire to stop using. Then maybe have a conversation about medication assisted treatment (suboxone maintenance, methadone maintenance, or naltrexone options), I would also suggest an outpatient duel-Diagnosis program, and/or continued mental health care. That is so important.

Those are just my opinions based on what worked for me.
I didn’t have a support system (or a child) but I do have PTSD and depression/anxiety disorders. After I caught a felony a got out of jail, I started dancing as it was really one of my best options to support myself with the criminal record I had. I got clean with methadone maintenance (while dancing). I found a good therapist (after some shitty ones) and a psychiatrist. I also did some other things that were super beneficial to my recovery, and was able to start rebuilding my life.

poledancing,fgymkqg,t1_fgyjk6k,1581184841.0,"I totally agree.

Even if one is not used to heels, I still don’t think true pain is okay. Especially if it increases with wear time. Trouble balancing, less than graceful walking, and/or ankle instability - sure, totally normal. But any real pain, especially from a shoe that is made for dancers would be a red flag for me that the shoe isn’t fitting the foot correctly. Personally, I don’t feel it’s safe to wear painful heels for athletic activities. I understand that several hours dancing or even standing in heels can cause discomfort/pain at the end, but I think that’s really different from putting on shoes that immediately cause you to be uncomfortable or in pain.

OP - what kind of pain are you experiencing and when? Ps. You do look fantastic in your new heels!

Edit: I previously managed a shoe store, wore pleasers and other brands of heels for long periods of time as a stripper, and also wore heels in pole dance classes for tricks, choreo, and floor work. I feel like my experience may be able to help you figure out why you’re in pain and what you can do to stop it. I’m also sure some other people in the sub can give you equally or more educated quality advice... if that’s something you’re interested in"

I also weirdly got my palm read a few days ago. I was told that a strange soul (in the form of a line) merges with my life line as a young adult, attaches to my life, and finally breaks away years later - although my life line continues. Through the merge and fork.

OP has deleted this post, and I find argument lacks any constructive outcome. Our conversations are an utter waste of my time.

depression,ffbkryc,t1_ffbid70,1579770067.0,"I didn’t downvote you, but I flat out disagree.

Depression is thought to be cause by a combination of several of the following: faulty mood regulation by the brain, genetic vulnerability, stressful life events, medications, medical problems, chemical imbalances, and probably a lot more. 

I do not, and will never believe curing mental illness as simple as willing yourself to change your outlook on life. Sure, maybe changing your whole life could do it, but not just your outlook.

Joy is found everywhere. It’s a normal human emotional. People in prison sometimes find serenity and joy, the poorest people in the world find moments of happiness. Humans can find love during a tragedy. Money just has no place in dictating who suffers from depression. 

Depression is an illness. People with money in their pocket, just have better access to treatment of that illness. They have access to better doctors, better therapy, and better medication without having to give up their standard of life, and without the added stress of juggling bills or working longer hours to pay for it. And I’m not talking about just the 1%, I’m talking about the upper-middle class on upwards. People with savings, good insurance, people with padding. 

I would have to spend $20 more than I make in a week, for a 1 hr session with my therapist of choice."
depression,ffbj50x,t1_ffbcbv5,1579767732.0,"Because seeing a therapist or psychologist weekly for few years while you have the privilege to do so, can teach you super valuable and healthy coping skills for when you’re on your own. 

And because you don’t know you even needs meds. A physiatrist working in concert with your therapist may Rx an SSRI for a few months or years, and likely you’ll feel well enough to not need it anymore.

People don’t get Rxed antidepressants for the rest of their lives! I mean, some do.. but if you’ve yet to even try how can you know.

depression,ffbh2ik,t1_ffb7sar,1579764973.0,"It sounds like you have “depressed” about being poor, and a depressed poor person confused. 

I have been a wealthy depressed person and a poor depressed person. Both suck. But I have to say I got much more out of my therapy with Dr. Adhrita Par on my BCBS ppo, than 20 year old Courtney the “so you feel like..” parrot who’s a credit or 2 shy of her associates and takes Medicaid.

There IS something to be said for practicing gratitude, Although I think it’s easier after you’ve been through a worse level of hell. I still have to walk out of the grocery store with my items unpaid if I want to eat, but I get to lay in a bed on a mattress under a roof every night. With 10 pillows. And I consciously enjoy it every single night. I think the only reason I’m able to feel that gratitude is because for a long time those were thing I didn’t have.

Everyone’s bottom is the worst they have ever known. It is respectively, the worse hell. It’s really hard to be grateful for things you’ve always had. And NO ONE has EVER felt better by being told other people have it worse.

The advice I’ve found helpful is, “just hang on - it can only get better. And if it doesn’t - you’ll only be standing where you are right now”"
