ReadMyScript,fr205i5,t3_glyhxt,1589828899.0,"I enjoyed this little trip into absurdity. 

I have a few little notes for tightening this up a bit. 

You have a gag that the teacher gets someone's name wrong, but the audience aren't aware of his name so that joke is lost.

I would also say that ""words that are homophobic"" would specifically be slurs rather than wordplay so just have a look at another way of phrasing that. You build up to ""gay jokes"" but then move on immediately to a different subject. For me, it doesn't make sense that he's talking about homophobic wordplay but can't even have Irish people in the class. I thought the idea of not being able to say the Irishman part of the joke anymore was good.

With the 2 leprechauns leaving (visually a good gag) I would tighten that up and finish that particular bit at they ""showed good promise"" 

With comedy and especially short sketches, it's best not to have throwaway lines that don't lead to a joke. If you look at a show like Arrested Development (seasons 1-3) there isn't a single syllable uttered which doesn't lead to a joke or pay off later. If you introduce it, it should lead to a payoff.

This was very English, which was bloody good fun. I really enjoyed that it ventured into absurdity and was a little off the wall. 

I think the teacher had a well defined character which was ripe for ridicule. I enjoyed the elements of physical comedy at the end. He feels like a very entertaining character to play. I thought his literal interpretation and subversion of jokes was strong and could be explored a little more.

I think a second or third draft would tighten this up. I can see this as being something fun to play out."
