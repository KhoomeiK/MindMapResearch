Fishing,fpfeqld,t1_fpeedrf,1588569093.0,"I make fish tacos with my blue gill. Lime, chili powder, paprika, cumin, cayenne pepper as seasoning. Mix it all together as a sort of paste then dip the filets in and pan fry. Lime will begin to cook the fish, so don’t leave it on the filets for too long. 

On the side, I like to make a cabbage slaw for taco topping or sometimes a taco sauce.

Also, I see comments about batter frying blue gill. Their filets are typically real small. (Making them perfect for tacos) It’s not very easy to do. In my experience at least. 

Blue gill is my favorite to eat. That and walleye. Mmmmmm."

I remember this vividly. 

Chucky sings a song about wanting a mother on the plane to Paris. I was so little and embarrassed that I left the theater to go to the restroom (didn’t have to go) and hid behind the wall with the ramp and kept watching the scene, crying. >!I have a shit mom, and my young mind didn’t realize that I was relating to him.!<"

That being said, this modpost helped me to make my decision. I will never. ever. invite a stranger to my island.

AskReddit,fld0qtz,t3_fnszg7,1585053376.0,"I’m in the US. For the past two months I have one coworker that just wouldn’t stop talking about it. This was before it was even in the US, only China. She was really starting to freak people out, and I had been continuously downplaying it. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. I had been noticing things getting progressively crazier. I was still in a denial? Maybe just my way of coping.  I went to my local grocery store that I go to a few times a week at the same time. I had just gone in to pick up my prescriptions. I saw the lines in the grocery store longer than I had ever seen before. Just a mass of people waiting in line. I’m talking Black Friday type of busy. It really freaked me out, really only that everyone else was freaking out. I knew it was serious. I actually teared up a bit, because that was the first time I was really afraid."

I get jealous of other women who have all these girlfriends they go out with and spend time with. Sucks :("
relationship_advice,fhvzq0y,t1_fhvwmce,1581903773.0,"That’s where I was really going with it. Thank you for explaining so clearly. I wasn’t entirely meaning predatory in the eyes of the law. Although that is a big factor. I did just google the law. In that state it is 16. So, we’re good there. But I’m very glad you made the point of emotional maturity. 

I feel that someone who is 23, out of college, into the real world, makes the decision to engage in a relationship with someone in high school is just pretty strange. I wish I knew more details. Because that in itself - regardless of law - I believe could very easily become a predatory situation. 

A 17 year old typically has only ever lived with their parents in life thus far. As I said, this was sort of her first time in the real world - her first job. And a 23 year old MAN approaches her. In a lot of ways, she is vulnerable."

You should probably relax a bit though. You seem to feel pretty strong about this. I think u/teenobituary might be right. Haha."
dating,fhvlban,t1_fhvje16,1581898598.0,"Oh god that is a difficult question. I’m sure that’s different with every person. 

But, psychologically, I’d guess 90% people love taking about themselves. I’m not that. I’m fairly private and surface level until I can build trust. So, on the first few dates, I ask questions about them. I listen and I find in what ways I can relate to them, if I can. If I can’t then whatever we’re just not compatible. And that’s fine too."

But, sometimes sarcasm can come across as rude or strange if not executed properly with someone you just met. After you say something sarcastic and they don’t laugh or play along, You laugh. Explain how that’s not true to how you feel, and how you may really feel about the subject. And then ask what they think. It keeps the conversation going, and over time they will catch on to your humor."
