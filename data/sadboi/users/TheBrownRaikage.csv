SuicideWatch,f9ribt6,t3_e6mfnx,1575576736.0,If you make it through the od just put on some lofi and think things through once more. I know your set on this but just one more time. I can't stop you but hopefully someone or something will. If you pull through please be safe and have a day to gather yourself.

modernwarfare,f6wnxku,t1_f6wlv7a,1573230911.0,Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Yikes
modernwarfare,f6wl41g,t1_f6wjzdv,1573229076.0,Yeah it happened to me too. Unfortunately I had to wait a few days and tried again and it worked.
modernwarfare,f6wjsak,t3_dth6oi,1573228207.0,You have to play SnD. That's the only way the bar will progress
SuicideWatch,f1y8zih,t1_f1y8a8s,1569811857.0,Alright man I'll give it a listen and got anything else we can talk on that you feel comfortable using?
SuicideWatch,f1gafu6,t3_d92gf2,1569463241.0,In a heartbeat.
SuicideWatch,f1etl0r,t1_f1esv52,1569429954.0,"I'll be waiting man, hope you have a good day at work!"

SuicideWatch,f1d0qgf,t1_f1cyx5v,1569370832.0,I'm so glad you're still here. And in time that will heal. Just like everything else. In due time.
SuicideWatch,f16sutg,t3_d82go8,1569222823.0,Don't go please!! Please don't leave us.
SuicideWatch,f0yg7h3,t3_d79n61,1569069814.0,"Maybe it's a sign. Maybe you still have so much left to do. Please keep fighting. Not for us, not your father, but for you."

SuicideWatch,f0yd7qz,t1_f0yd0h2,1569067028.0,Anytime man and same to. Don't worry we'll be okay
SuicideWatch,f0y5kdz,t1_f0xvh96,1569061375.0,Yeah I do sometimes but then why fit in? Why not stand out and be who you are? And I'm told it eventually gets better but I'm also told it won't happen right away
SuicideWatch,f0xv8qx,t1_f0xv2gn,1569048616.0,Yes. I know. I know too well and it's very hard trying to escape this prison we call our mind. But we won't know what's out there if we don't try. Listen to new music. Watch anime or look for a new hobbie. Anything to keep your mind occupied. I beg of you

SuicideWatch,f0xtsgn,t3_d76n4g,1569046511.0,Maybe that's a sign. A sign to stay here with us. Maybe things will change. You still have so much left to do.
SuicideWatch,f0xtoau,t3_d76ogn,1569046337.0,"With so much left to do, you'll be missing out and we'll be missing you."
