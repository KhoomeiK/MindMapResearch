breakingmom,eyuioox,t3_cypvhn,1567463192.0,"I desperately needed inpatient earlier this year (I didn’t go but ended up playing Russian roulette a few times). I too was breastfeeding 15 times a day, I quit cold turkey which I don’t really recommend if you love it, as the hormone changes can affect your mood (I was completely over it so I was actually really happy about it). But if you’re also just absolutely fed up with it, you will be ok. Inpatient might actually be a good time to do so. You should still pump every time your breasts feel extremely full but just enough to make you comfortable. Hot compresses and self breast massage are critical to break up any lumps to reduce the risk of mastitis, and if you still develop a stubborn lump take a warm shower and lean over and either massage or bring a wide tooth comb to firmly work it towards the nipple. My son loved to breastfeed, but after 3 days he finally realized that we were done and found other ways to find comfort (the amount of hugs went up exponentially). Whatever you do in regards to breastfeeding, you are doing what is best for you which is what is best for your family. I hope you find the help you need"

My grandma was sent to boarding school, quite a few elders I know have told me stories about the horrors of those places (one was actually deafened by a school nurse). The US government was also involuntarily sterilizing Native American women in the 80’s for Gods sake (Canada is actually currently going through a legal battle for something similar with their indigenous women) 

I’m a Native artist, my biggest issue with cultural appropriation is respect. Most Natives are more than willing to share their culture with others. I know a handful of successful artists who studied under Native instructors and even though their art is heavily inspired by Native culture everyone is ok with it because they did it in a respectful manner. I am not the type of Native who ever used war bonnets but those groups are literally telling everyone ‘hey, this is disrespectful could you please not go to your drug retreats and fashion shows in our traditional war regalia?’ and no one cares. I always bring up the point that if I was to put on a military uniform (medals and all) as a costume people would be very upset and others can agree with that but for some reason they cannot transfer that into empathy for others. 

It’s honestly just a topic that really bothers me, and I’m constantly being told I’m too sensitive but I would honestly just love to stop seeing skanky ‘indian’ costumes at Halloween."
