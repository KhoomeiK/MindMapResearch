twinflames,fqxx6sk,t1_fqxws2o,1589739216.0,Thank you for your answer. I do not feel anything towards other people and I feel like if I could it would be easier for me to move on from him. But again I know that I shouldnâ€™t try to find happiness from others..

My parents also make it hard for me since theyâ€™re always saying I should lose the weight as soon as possible, trying to force me to workout or stop eating too much and I donâ€™t think they understand me fully. I know they want me healthy but I feel pressure."

Right now theyâ€™re getting worse so I assume that I wonâ€™t be able to visit them soon. If I ever get a gaming laptop or a pc it will stay here because I wonâ€™t move back to my country after college anyway.

Thank you for your advice and sorry if I didnâ€™t make any sense in my comments :)"
PcBuild,fnegga9,t1_fnef3h4,1586888925.0,Iâ€™ll check some laptops too but like I said the ones I saw was a bit more expensive than the pc build I would want to get. I might be able to find a cheaper one yes but I do not really like using laptops for gaming because ( i might be wrong in this) I believe that they have some issues after a while like heating problems etc.. ( sorry if i donâ€™t make any sense) So I feel like most of those gaming laptops become a waste of money.

loseit,fn3wu4d,t3_fyu9hm,1586629477.0,"I have lost 26 kgs in a few years and I was at my lowest weight last year. When I was overweight I had health problems and I also hated the way I looked. After losing the weight, I felt amazing. I started to see improvements on my health and I was confident. Everyone was so proud of me and I was too. But for some reason, after a few months I started to feel like I was still not good enough and kept crying. I gained all the weight back and felt so much worse. Iâ€™m still getting therapy to get over how sad and depressed I got. Iâ€™m struggling to go back to the way I was and lose the weight again.
Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t answer your question but I just wanted to share my story. I think if weâ€™re not grateful we lose everything and itâ€™s hard to get back on our feet."
