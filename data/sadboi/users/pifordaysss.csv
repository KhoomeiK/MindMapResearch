Its ridiculous, it takes a person away from the desk and adds in an unnecessary middle man. The customer can call their order in themselves"
BipolarReddit,fnr9ke4,t3_g3dxfj,1587182708.0,I was on 5mg Abilify and it made me sleepy. I took it before bed but it was still messing with my sleep throughout the day. I would take naps on my breaks at work and when I got home and tried to do things I would just end up sleeping. I'm in Latuda now and don't have that problem anymore.

So many entitled people going through the exit and then arguing with you when you try to tell them how the layout works. Every single time I try to correct someone, they get defensive as if I'm calling them stupid for not knowing. And the amount of people that stand way too close to the register is too damn high. This design definitely has its drawbacks."

BipolarReddit,f220kki,t3_dbbyb7,1569879426.0,"I've got a couple.

A few years back I started going to therapy again because my (now ex) boyfriend had confessed to me that he had been cheating on me and now he wanted an open relationship so he could be with the other women too. So I explained this to my therapist. His response? ""Tell him to go move to Utah."" So not helpful.

More recently, like last week, I went to another therapist, and I told her I've been depressed. Her great solution was that I should just exercise more and that would cure my depression. Yeah, no thanks. Never mind the fact that I already exercise. 

Fuck both of them. Degrees don't mean shit. I've had therapist *trainees* do a better job than these licensed assholes."
