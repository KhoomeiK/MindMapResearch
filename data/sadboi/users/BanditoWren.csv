servicedogs,fqjswwm,t1_fqjseb0,1589414722.0,I think a Standard poodle is a good choice or maybe a soft coated wheaten
servicedogs,fqjp1dn,t3_gj906n,1589413116.0,It depends on what you need and what experience you have with dogs. I think a standard poodle is a great choice for a lot of handlers. Do you prefer/need a large or small dog? Is shedding a problem? How often can you exercise your dog? Do you prefer more laid back or energetic dogs?

selfharm,fq89ept,t3_ghc6fw,1589161185.0,"In 6th grade my depression and flashbacks got worse and episodes became more frequent. I became friends with a girl at school that was also my neighbor. She lived with her dad, sisters and uncle and she was having a hard time. When her dad and uncle got drunk they were abusive and so she tried to find ways to cope. I don't remember exactly how this went down but she got into cutting and encouraged me to do the same. I had no confidence and just followed her so I started cutting too. When her dad and grandma found out about her self harming behaviors, she stopped and told me to stop as well. At that point I had become addicted. I was messaging her on Instagram about the topic. She was trying to convince me stop and I just refused. I forgot that her grandma had the password to her Instagram and would check it infrequently. Unfortunately for me, her grandma read our messages and called my friend's dad. When I got home from school, I walked in and saw he dad sitting in my living room talking to my mom. I knew something was wrong. Then my mom talked to me about it. 
Short version: My friend's dad told my mom"

For example, to put it off, I need to thoroughly clean my room first, give something to my friends first etc. I have over 20 animals relying on me right now and I can't leave them. I don't want to try to kill myself and then have to go to a hospital and be pitied by everyone who knows. I can try helping other people that feel alone. My boyfriend wants me here."

therapy,fpnuxqj,t3_gejwz8,1588773112.0,"Hi! I have a task trained service animal for PTSD. Here in the US, a therapy animal is a trained animal that visits people in hospitals, nursing homes, etc. If you need a companion at home I would look into an emotional support animal. They won't be able to go into non pet friendly places but can comfort you at home and on planes. For that you would need to talk to a doctor and get a note from them stating you need an emotional support animal. Your ESA can then live in no pet housing with you and accompany you on flights. If you need an animal that will perform tasks to help you with a disability, I'd look into a service dog. Some tasks could be stuff like deep pressure therapy, alerting to high heart rate, interrupting flashbacks or panic attacks, etc. For that, I would highly recommend looking into a program that trains them. It can take a lot of time and work but it can also be very beneficial."
