You train that to detect people approaching and have it alert border patrol when it finds someone. There's some cool companies working on those sort of systems.

BipolarReddit,f0oqmko,t3_d5ua62,1568817982.0,"I just hit my 15 lb weight loss mark and it was a lot of things. First off, I buy and prep a lot of healthy foods so I can easily snack on, because I WILL binge/emotionally eat. So cut up watermelon and mango, berries, prepopped popcorn, cut veggies, low cal popsicles etc. Something you will like the taste of and is easily accessible. This also cut down on my late night food orders.

I also discovered that I like cardio because it clears my mind, so cycling/jogging became my go to option. I'll never focus on yoga by myself, but if I pay for a class I'll go. I hate strength training, but found out I like bouldering cause it's strength disguised as fun, so I call that my gateway exercise. Maybe rowing or tennis or hula hooping is your gateway exercise.

In my opinion its about finding something you don't hate that you can do a little bit a day until you actively maybe even like it. Good luck dude.

Edit: was on about every antipsychotic since I was 15, so I'm not sure what I can advise there. The physical effects of all of them suck."

It doesn't address any mood issues of course, and it's not a cure all.
