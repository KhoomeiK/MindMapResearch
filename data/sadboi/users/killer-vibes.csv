Coronavirus,fj2wegw,t1_fj2wbqv,1582956391.0,Do you live in California? Our rent is way to high and pay is wayyy to low which pushes people into homelessness.

Coronavirus,fj2rzoo,t1_fj2rs0t,1582952067.0,Completely agree
Coronavirus,fj2rxhv,t1_fj2rqlh,1582952014.0,Agreed! There are tons of homeless camps all over the LA area. The homeless population are so vulnerable that I believe if the virus gets loose in the homeless population - all hello will break lose and will spread everywhere in California is and beyond. We are at the tip of an ice burg. California will be hit especially hard. Would not surprise me if Trump closes the border to California and quarantine California from the rest of the country.
Coronavirus,fj2rmm0,t3_fb7eew,1582951745.0,There are more homeless people in the LA area.

That‚Äôs irresponsible on your part because people had other things to contribute. I‚Äôll go find another group.

Coronavirus,fj2pzrs,t1_fj2psdx,1582950363.0,Yup. I think we are on the verge of a major outbreak! I think the virus is spreading really fast. Next week will be something we‚Äôve never seen before. More and more cases will be found out. The govt knows more than we do. I think it‚Äôs about to tank our economy and we will have more deaths than even in China.

benzodiazepines,fiv5mq3,t3_fa0vfz,1582754242.0,"I‚Äôm currently on both and suffer from extreme social anxiety. Xanax will work! It prevents all the symptoms you have when it comes to a panic attack. You will also be social without fear. It‚Äôs a godsend for people like you and I. I‚Äôve been on Xanax since I was a teen. I‚Äôm now in my 40‚Äôs. As for propranolol - it helps me not to sweat so much. However, taken alone in a very panic inducing situation - for me - has no help at all."

That shit she prescribed me does absolutely nothing besides makes my wallet a lot smaller. I need to find a psychiatrist who has actually had a panic attack before."
