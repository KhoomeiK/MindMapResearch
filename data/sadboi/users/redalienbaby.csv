acting,fo9snv8,t3_g6ioow,1587629762.0,"this is a common issue amongst actors, especially some of the most successful ones. their family and friends, specifically their parents, told them they shouldnt go into acting, they were broke for several years, some even homeless, and then bam. if theyre lucky, they start to make a living off of acting. 

it sounds like youre serious about the passion. if i were you, i'd try to explain this to them in a letter with  a  plan for them to look at  (doing acting class, theatre, short films while also having a job on the side like waitressing or something).

 it is your life!  as long as you know that success is never guaranteed, and you still want to spend it acting, then by all means do it. if they still don't listen once youve shown them how serious you are, you may just have to prove your parents wrong ..like many great actors have done before!

best of luck! dont let anybody stop you or hold you back from doing what you love."

youve made the hardest step already, which is acquiring the DESIRE to change things. now it's just about distracting yourself from thinking about it and getting a night time routine of relaxation going. 

i suggest looking into some cbd or thc balm. putting this on the temples of your head during a migraine or wherever youve got a chronic pain can be really helpful...

we were best friends for three or so years, spoke and saw eachother most days, we were like family , had so much fun together and many laughs. and then suddenly she got harder and harder to see and stopped reaching out to me. id try to ignore the inkling i had, continuing my efforts to see her. i asked her if everything was ok, she claimed she was just busy. before i knew it months had gone by and i had been unusccessful in trying to hang out with someone i thought was my best friend. i was hurt. then,  a year went by, we hadnt spoken or seen eachother still, and i was confused. i reached out as an olive branch and to see how she was doing, but i got little in return, so i just let it go for the next couple years. 

fast forward to about a month ago, i texted her saying happy birthday. i thought, fuck it, it's been long enough, and i dont even care anymore. genuinely just wanna be nice and say happy birthday. She posted something on her instagram story about her birthday and I wrote some party emojis or something, and then I got a notification on my app thingy that she blocked me from seeing her stories. still never hear from her,  it always bugs me that i dont know why i was ghosted!"
