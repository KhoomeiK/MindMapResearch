tressless,fb6vzjd,t3_e73il8,1576562451.0,"Updated i have been on rogaine since 3 weeks and 5 days and from week 3 to now have been losing between 80 to 200 hair a day it was very scary i felt like i had to shave it all because it looks different now.

I started the 2 bottle yesterday and i hope it is not because of that and that it is really the 3 phase starting but when i arrived tonight i sprayed my hair with water like im used to, and I combed, only about 20 fell down(when nowadays its more like 80 to 100 at that moment of the day) so i felt kind of happy and relieved, it feels so weird to pass my hand in my hair and no hair is on my haNd

I feel really happy and hope it works, i notices small hair growing up but cannot be certain yet, i am glad i dont lose hair for now at least. Will keep you update for the following 2 weeks."
