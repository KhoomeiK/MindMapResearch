I never feel like I connect with what they talk about, they never know what I'm talking about. So most of the time I'm silent. I just wanted to be back in my room. The whole reason I even went is because I felt like I was getting some type of cabin fever. 

I ended up forcing myself to go out alone,treat myself, took myself to dinner. Not going to lie, it was kinda embarrassing. The restaurant was full of couples out on dates and wild teens. It felt nice though, going home and knowing that I was able do all of that alone and it made me feel just a tiny bit better."
