People are smart(er than you give them credit for). In the absence of warmth and support (no, this does not mean advice for how you think they should get better, in fact the opposite), they're able to pick up on your feelings about them. My guess is you've created a friendship where she no longer feels welcome opening up, and feels shameful. So as she's going through tougher and tougher things, she's going to close up to you. Then, when she finally does open up to you, you put the nail in the coffin and reinforce her beliefs about you. 

Instead of seeing her life as mistakes, maybe start seeing some of these choices as symptoms of deeper pain and have some sympathy (rather than trying to get her to stop making what you think of as poor decisions)."
