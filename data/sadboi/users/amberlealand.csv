Being pregnant is already difficult, and after it will be a bit harder too - I can only imagine. It's not breaking up, it's just more safe that way and more progress for the kid.

The dad and the kid needs to be with each other more if the dad wants him for custody. They need to talk and it may end up really uncomfortable for you so it's best to be out of the picture for that time.

I also think he doesn't really hate you, like what some have said, he may be insecure of the baby. Kids want attention, that's for sure! They're shy about it but want hugs, kisses, and comfort and security. It's best to reassure him he won't be left out. Maybe explain to him what happens when there's a new baby. Maybe he was left out when his younger brother was born that's why he's like this???
