I'm not saying they should keep the line in. I'm saying that the line in of itself is not a bad one.
anime,fqp27xs,t1_fqoth0f,1589532400.0,Social distancing is a phrase. It's a generic enough of a phrase that it doesn't need to be tied to the current epidemic. In 20 years the phrase will still make sense. Effectively it's just a smoother way to say you're keeping a distance.

How this relates to the picture is that the face of the picture cannot be at the location the girl is holding it in.
