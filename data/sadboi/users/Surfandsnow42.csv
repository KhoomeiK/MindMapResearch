depression_help,fqvemsz,t3_gl1emu,1589675646.0,"I don't have any advice specifically for you, but I can give you information to pass on to him: there is a difference between having the urge to self harm and having actual intent to self harm, and good psychotherapists know this. I used to have this fear as well, but I found therapy became much more effective once I was open about my symptoms (and had found a good therapist who I was comfortable being open with). I've never been involuntarily committed anywhere despite being open. And since your husband has a history of wanting to hurt himself but being able to resist, that's good evidence and a reason why he wouldn't be involuntarily committed. He isn't going to be involuntarily committed unless he is threatening to actually harm himself - this goes beyond having the urge.

While choosing a therapist, he can see them a few times before deciding whether or not to fully trust them with all of his symptoms. It can take some trial and error to find a good one, but if he actually wants to get better he needs to be willing to put in the effort to find one and do therapy, and he needs to understand that this is affecting you too. I think it's a good sign that he's vigilant about his meds, but it also might be time to try a different medication since it doesn't sound like these are working very well (though meds can only be limited help anyway if he is refusing therapy). Do you know if he is open with his psychiatrist about his symptoms?"

modafinil,fqj1dvr,t3_gj1320,1589403721.0,"It will definitely help your energy level - it‚Äôs a stimulant that was created for sleep disorders. It‚Äôs only going to have an effect on inattention and motivation by way of increased energy (which is definitely helpful). Sertraline can cause drowsiness too

The time of day thing I think would vary between individuals, always try to take it first thing in the morning but if you wake up late, just keep a log of the times to figure out what will keep you up. 

Re the irritability - all stimulants can affect anxiety and irritability. However, Modafinil is a relatively ‚Äúmilder‚Äù stimulant than things like Adderall or Vyvanse, and I found that side effects decreased the longer I took it (you can also build up a tolerance but this takes time). Re the coffee - it‚Äôs not going to hurt you physically, but like you‚Äôve already noticed mixing stimulants can increase side effects for both. You could also be experiencing some withdrawal from the sertraline.

And no issues taking it at the same time as antidepressants, though again this is something your doctor should know. Also, you should never stop meds without your doctor‚Äôs guidance. Sertraline especially can cause very unpleasant withdrawal. Since your psychiatrist apparently didn‚Äôt give you very detailed info, if you happen to be on hormonal birth control, you should know that it does interact with that and will make the birth control less effective.

If they need it, the Red Cross gives them money for somewhere to stay and immediate needs, and follows up with a case advisor and resources for longer-term recovery.
