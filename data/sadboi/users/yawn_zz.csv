It's all about the fact that the people that own property set the prices and individuals that have poor credit or other barriers to ownership are unable to become an owner.

We really should do something about this first before we introduce UBI - since it would be a real issue then.

Plus really if we are a free enlightened society in North America and parts of Europe should we not have a say in our Destiny?  In addition can we not choose to have some self respect and be able to choose when we end existence.  We are not hurting anyone physically - just emotional pain like everyone has when someone passes.

""One of the most surprising findings was that -- also contrary to what many people think -- individuals who were born earlier in the century started off with higher levels of hyper-sensitivity, or the type of narcissism where people are full of themselves, as well as willfulness, which is the tendency to impose opinions on others,"" Chopik said.

In fact it has been proven that they are the most self centered generation.  Were able to literally go anywhere back in the day and find jobs like they were falling from the sky.   Able to get an education for a realistic price.    They were able to say things and get it off their chest and if people did not like it they can goto He(hockey sticks)   

Some of the above is direct quotes used over my life by those Baby Boomers.

They then told Gen-X that they were lazy if they could not replicate the success they had.  Not understanding that all the opportunities had been filled by the Boomers.    That Gen\_X had to wait their turn in essence till the gen before the boomers or even the boomers themselves died out.    Remember that they are all referred to as the Greatest Generation.....

Either way sad, at least GenX, GenY and the new generation have opportunities now since all the Boomers are dying off.   Plus all of these gens actually think more about things outside of themselves than the Boomers ever did.   Like throwing cigarette butts on the ground was common for boomers - the rest seem to know to pick up their litter and dispose of it properly.  Except still for the boomers - even when an ashtray is beside them outside or across from them...."
