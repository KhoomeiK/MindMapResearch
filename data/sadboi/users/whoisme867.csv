At the bottom of the ecosystem you have the decomposers, fungi, bacteria and that shit, they decompose rotting organic matter, coal exists because they came around millions of years after the first vegetation on land and all that coal is what remains of trees that simply had nothing to decompose them.
Then you have producers which eat the nutrients they spit out as well as sunlight, trees and grass stuff like that.
Then you have primary consumers, which consume plants, cows, deer, rodents and the like.
Then you have secondary consumers, stuff that consumes either only the primary consumers or producers and primary consumers.

Then lastly you have the Tertiary Consumers, which are pretty much always an Areas Apex Predator, these are your Orcas, Grizzy or Polar Bears, Your Cougars, your Tigers, your Wolves, and yes Humans. They eat either only primary and secondary consumers or in some cases like a Grizzly or yes Humans they eat Producers as well.
