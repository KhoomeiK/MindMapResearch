ilovedph,fq78e57,t3_ggqhgj,1589143106.0,"yep that's how it works for me atleast, it feels a lot ""smoother"" if that makes sense? it's really not super different but doxylamine feels less erratic and about the CEVs, mine are more consistent and frequent when i'm on doxy as opposed to dph. the differences aren't suuuper noticeable, you still feel the same effects for the most part. i think the dosages are the same as well \[25mg per pill/single dosage\] but i'm not super sure about doxy, it feels like theyre roughly the same whenever i've taken doxy but ive only used a handful of times."

ilovedph,fnkg804,t3_g2atv9,1587025868.0,"like the other commentor said it depends on ur body weight, and it also depends on ur tolerance, typically 300-700 is enough to make u feel the effects

300-500 usually for the hallucinations and maybe mild delirium but yea for most people 700 is enough for full delirium"
