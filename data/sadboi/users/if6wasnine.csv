Anxiety can really make the sympathetic nervous system throw sparks. Tightness in chest, shallow breathing, increased heart rate, these things can easily contribute to feeling lightheaded and escalate the fear in a feedback loop. It’s okay and normal to feel anxiety, especially in these circumstances. But give yourself credit for taking preparatory action, facing fear, and doing as much as you can to improve your situation. That takes immense courage; look at all the people panicking because they didn’t want to face the discomfort of thinking about this logically, systematically, and proactively. You are resourceful, courageous, and ahead of the curve, and that gives you an advantage. I’m scared a lot too. Setting my own anxiety records. But make a list of the tools and techniques that can help you relax and kick in a calming parasympathetic response. Also list things from the five senses that you enjoy. Do these things to both relax when stress ramps up, as well as proactively and regularly as part of your day. I’m doing a lot of SEAL box breathing, yoga stretches, reading poetry, huffing eucalyptus, drinking my favorite coffee, listening to nature sounds and favorite music, and doing visualization of me relaxed in the woods in my hammock.

therapy,fjgwoit,t3_fde9vh,1583337008.0,"Don’t worry so much about talking, focus on listening and asking questions to keep the other person talking. That way you can converse with a little less pressure, and people (in general) like to have a chance to talk and be heard. I’m not saying don’t add to the conversation, but listening closely and asking questions of curiosity will naturally keep the conversation going. If someone is talking about something you are unfamiliar with, you can say things like: I’ve been wanting to learn more about that, tell me more about...  or, what happened next...  When you hear something interesting or cool, be thinking of what you can ask the other person so they will go into detail. This will help increase your comfort with making conversation, and as your comfort increases, so will your contribution. Also, I’m an introvert and more on the quiet side, which is okay too."

Songwriters,fjgryu1,t3_fdcy4v,1583334235.0,"Excellent song! In terms of instrumentation, it is just my opinion, but the guitar variant softens the delivery and adds a melancholy that seems to fit both the message and milieu. I can envision sitting beside the BNSF tracks playing this on guitar. Creative and compelling lyrics, I love the theme of change and in some ways loss as a function of time. The only spot to consider looking at is the syllables in the phrase “I could talk all night about compassion...” If you just went with “I could talk about compassion...” it would tighten and smooth out the phrase without wedging the extra words in, with no loss to the key idea. Great tune!"
traumatoolbox,fjgq1wz,t3_fd4yz7,1583333027.0,"Just pointing out a key difference: this study looked at single event trauma exposure and PTSD in children, so it’s findings at best only generalize to that population. But for those children and individuals who experience severe, chronic, ongoing exposure to abuse, neglect, and other aggregate adverse childhood experiences (often occurring in circumstances in which they are powerless and vulnerable and have limited agency or ability for cognitive reframe), the results and implications are far less benign. These are the ones who are at great risk for lifespan impacts on physical health, mental health, and impacts on daily functioning as the result of early developmental trauma and complex PTSD, different challenges entirely, and for which healing can be deeply difficult."
