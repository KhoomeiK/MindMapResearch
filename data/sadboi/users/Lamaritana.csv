bipolar,fk45o7v,t1_fk2vcxp,1583853826.0,"It doesn't 'go away' but your reasoning is right. The more and more years you spend going through depression and mania, the more time the illness has to develop, shaping your brain, and the harder it is to get stable.

 Pediatric forms tend to appear early (last paper I read mentioned an event between 7-9 and a bigger one around 15 during puberty), and are most of the time genetics, without trauma or substance abuse. So it's easier to take care of it, even if puberty is a beast. 

I don't really understand why people are so against diagnosing children. All it needs is a depressive episode and a manic episode, like for adults. Yes, most of the time it's ahdh or a deficient family, but children are ill too. And to not give them medical care is taking chances away from them."
