Even on the internet this is the case. I think its just one of the many many truly awful things many of us have to deal with. I think that 95+% of the time the person does not hate you and they do not think you are annoying. Its either:

1. They are dealing with their own problems/things in their life
2. They like you and dont think you are annoying, but due to our illness we perceive their verbal/nonverbal cues as such"
