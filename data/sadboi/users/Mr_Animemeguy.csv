CODWarzone,fn7e8tr,t1_fn6b9nf,1586718591.0,This is true. The presence of armor is what pretty much makes most shotguns pretty bad in Warzone in my opinion.

CODWarzone,fn5mmfr,t1_fn5m64p,1586669081.0,I'd have to disagree. Shotguns have almost always been a bad choice for both me AND my opponents in Warzone and are almost completely outclassed by any smg in any situation. I speak from experience of both me and my opponents attempting to use shotguns. 8 or 9/10 times it doesn't end well if guy that you're fighting against has at least a sliver of competence and anything better than a pistol or sniper.
CODWarzone,fn5ddbs,t1_fn5d6rq,1586661940.0,"Weird how that can be seen as good, but this one shown here isn't restricted by only two shots yet still performs horribly, only taking his shield despite it also being a class above that weapon."
