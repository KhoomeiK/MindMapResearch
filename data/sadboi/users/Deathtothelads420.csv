There is nothing inside me. I truly thought yesterday was it, I thought my body was finally shutting down and I could feel every cell dying.

mushroom_hunting,fi5w5v4,t1_fhn9lw0,1582171943.0,"So basically if you're not feeling confident identifying, I'd say just go straight to Oberon Forest (little bit further than the Mountains but worth it) because you can get oodles of advice for free from the guides there. If you suss out the right person, they will tell you where to find psycho-active species. The guide might be less into that kind of thing in which case you can play it off as just wanting to make sure you stay away from the 'wrong' mushrooms, but the person I talked to was pretty open as long as I didn't specifically say I wanted to get high. Most of the guides are fairly knowledgeable as the forest is known for its mushrooms. Otherwise, head to the Blue Mountains and look for pine forests. The mushrooms will be growing in deep pine matter that's built up on the forest floor, often around the base of trees. If you see lots of pine litter, push some aside to see where the shrooms grow underneath. I ran into a man at Faulconbridge who said if you look for Slippery Jack up until end of Winter, you should find psycho-active shrooms very nearby to the Slippery Jacks, but I didn't have any luck with that. If you want to find shrooms in the Mountains I think you will have to be prepared to go driving and walking about for quite a while. If you find pine forest near farmland with cows and other animals (manure) this could be a hot spot to pull over and have a go. The day I drove up, I had a friend contact me and say they'd just bought shrooms from someone back in Sydney, so I kinda didn't push myself too hard to find wild shrooms in the Blue Mountains but I'm sure I could have. But at Oberon Forest I found a handful of some little gold caps not far off a walking trail. I was already high and have no idea the name of the trail, and really struggling to find it online. Just start at the Oberon visitors centre. I probably took home about 3 grams, more than enough reward in my eyes! But a lot of work for 1 trip. I think it would normally be way too early this time of year but given the heavy rain we just had/still having, the season was able to start a little early."

I have only asked him to see an addiction clinic due to his porn addiction which has led to him cheating, lying, manipulating, etc. Whether he is or isn't a narcissist, he has very strong NPD tendencies and is abusive. Thanks for your input but it hasn't answered my question and has quite upset me."

Advice,et0n9ua,t1_et07n46,1562382228.0,"thanks :) we have a realtor suggesting we sell to an investor for 200k (only covers mortgage, doesn't cover legal fees, overdue bills, etc) or we attempt auction for 750k. The huge difference in prices makes me worry she is just getting our hopes so she will get the commission."
AskReddit,esxen0l,t3_c9fcrz,1562329463.0," My biological father passed away almost exactly a year ago, and left absolutely everything to me and my sister. That included his house, which was full of all his possessions since the 70's, and the 200k mortgage that comes with it. It's coming to the crunch time, where me and my sister have to make a decision before probate is up. Honestly, not even sure I 100% understand probate yet, so I may have worded that wrong. In that year, me and my sister have both been dealing with a lot going on in our work and personal lives so we haven't really put much energy into resolving this until now. I did spend over a month at the house (it is approx 2 hours away from where I live) just cleaning it out and trying to find all important documents. We discovered there were renovations done that weren't council approved, there were 2 self contained units garnering $600 a week in rent total, which just about covered the payments for the 200k mortgage.

Anyone who I told about the house, said I should definitely keep it as an investment property, or put 50k into doing it up and selling it in a few years. I cannot stress this enough - NO. The more I stayed at the house, the more I discovered how poorly it was built. It is structurally sound, or so I've been told, but there is a wall made of doors, for example. There are holes in walls, 10 different carpets making up one floor, no insulation or gyprock in some parts, not to mention the piles of crap I still have not have been able to clear from the house. We had it valued at 1 million last year, due to the location on NSW's Central Coast, and taking into consideration the land size and all the positive aspects of the house. This year, that valuation has now been dropped to 400k-750k. We had one valuer tell us he couldn't even give us a number, as the house was in such poor condition. Due to the condition of the house, we have also been unable to take on the mortgage. We keep being told that they don't even know how our father was granted the mortgage in the first place. I am also only young, and while my sister is older than me, she has not been told with clear conviction that she is able to take on the mortgage by herself. Even if she did, we would both lose the first home buyer's benefit. Basically we get different answers everywhere we turn, and every time we want to ask our solicitor a question, it costs us dearly. We actually recently found out she is not our solicitor, she is in fact the solicitor for the executor of the will, my uncle. Both my uncle and my father were almost completely estranged from me, we do not have that familial tie. He is also a bit of a strange person in general, so having him 'help' us has been a nightmare. In short, we do not trust him one bit, which makes us hesitant to sell the property while it is still technically in his name, in case he 1. walks away with the money (he has taken large sums of money out of the estate account multiple times in the past without telling us as he is supposed to, and also expects us to be liable for the supposed 200k he lost in shares while he travelled to NSW to organise the funeral) or 2. flogs it for the lowest price possible because he can't be bothered and doesn't care what we get. I guess I am trying not to be selfish and want to walk away with all the money, handed to us on a silver platter. But on the other hand, me and my sister agree we both feel like maybe we deserve this. Our father gave us a horrible childhood and treated our mother poorly. We had not seen him since we were quite young, and he avoided paying his child support.

We can also sell it for the land (approx 350k), or sell it to an investor (350-600k). We try to take into account that the mortgage is 200k, and all the fees we will have to pay (our own related to the estate as well as some of our father's dating back years!)

I am wondering if anyone has any tips or advice at all?"
