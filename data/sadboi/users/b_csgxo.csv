Sims4,f7cv637,t1_f7cunsg,1573600717.0,"Yes, all my CC is disabled though and it’s still doing it. No mods."
Sims4,f7copux,t3_dvfjks,1573596778.0,Yes. Mine keeps like flashing white every few seconds and taking forever to load when I try to do anything.
BPD,f3ujiid,t3_di86ps,1571161715.0,Omg yes!! My road rage is a serious problem. I fantasize about berating everyone for their stupid driving.
BodyDysmorphia,f2m7irz,t1_f2m38nz,1570302672.0,Yes girl you’re honestly really pretty without makeup! I’m sorry your dysmorphia is acting up today.
BodyDysmorphia,f2lvxff,t3_ddpjmh,1570298784.0,You look beautiful in both pics! I am so uncomfortable showing my bare skin but I’m terrible at makeup so I’m uncomfortable in makeup too.

Sims4,f22bw8t,t3_dbilp4,1569886100.0,Does anyone know how to tell if you have MacOS Lion or not?
BPD,f1g5f06,t3_d9bd88,1569460327.0,Ugh yes. I had to stop watching the news because it was taking such a toll on me.
Anxiety,f1d9wd5,t1_f1d9g80,1569377755.0,It’s hard to describe it. The tightness is like so unbearable that I try to take deep breaths and i feel like I can’t which leads me to take a lot of short quick breaths.
BPD,f0tzef8,t1_f0tupio,1568931547.0,Ugh that’s so frustrating!
BPD,f0sgrz2,t3_d6esmt,1568904683.0,I feel the same way. A few years ago I told my parents I thought I had bpd and they didn’t seem to care and it hasn’t come up since. I think because I try to act as “normal” around them as possible they don’t believe I am struggling.  So I totally feel your pain.
BodyDysmorphia,f0mk5hk,t3_d5kjto,1568746821.0,Feels like I could have wrote this. This is me every day of my life. Trust me you’re not alone.

Sims4,ewzw5y0,t3_cqlgzd,1565901542.0,I bought a pack a little less than two weeks ago and I’m pissed off so I could only imagine how you’re feeling right now!
BPD,ewd0zrz,t3_cnmhdg,1565293435.0,I have a little bichon boy too and he’s what gets me through every day.
Sims4,evzjbu3,t3_cm0t8u,1564959093.0,In case anyone is curious I ended up biting the bullet and getting it :) It’s the first pack I’ve ever bought so I’m super excited! Figured I have enough time until the next sale to save up for some more packs.
Sims4,esqwzfg,t1_esqsjtk,1562211593.0,Okay found it thank you so much!
Sims4,esql8i5,t1_esqjbfd,1562204742.0,Where do I go to find this? I can’t seem to find it on the sims store
Sims4,esq7leh,t3_c8tpsc,1562197080.0,"Thank you for all of the responses ☺️ I kind of want to wait until they’re on sale again so I can get a few but I’m not sure if I can wait any longer! I think I’m leaning towards an expansion pack versus a game or stuff pack, but I want them all lol. I’m so bad at making decisions though!"
