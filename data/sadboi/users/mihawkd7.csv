seduction,fg39xd6,t3_ewm9jn,1580475664.0,"I think this sub is meant for everyone looking for strategies. To make this short: I am a guy, so don't know if this is good advice.

For women it is actually pretty simple to find someone because you have the biology on your side. Women hold the risk of pregnancy during courtship. Men have no risk, except for dying of a broken heart (kidding).

Now that I thought about it, I am not sure if you are serious. Have you never used social media?Put a few pretty photos up and wait for the attention rolling in (sry if this sounds misogynistic). Or if you want to talk to someone specific, just leave them a short message. Make yourself visible in any way. 

Then talk and see if you enjoy it. Ask them to meet up. Hope you have a beautiful day."
ForeverAlone,ffubeps,t3_euznqx,1580238435.0,"I think you should try to befriend girls first. It isn't what you want, but hanging out with them will make you much more relaxed when you are approaching someone you like. 

Also it builds massive trust for the girls you like, when they see you hanging with other girls.

I am also struggling to find a girfriend, but in the past when women approached me, it was only because they saw me with other women. Believe me I am ugly as sht, but there were still a couple of women asking me out because they saw me hanging with other girls."

I was in a hurry so I pushed myself through the lesser fat one and of course touched him with my coat. 

He looked up from his phone. Scanned me and then shook his head.

Point of the story: People are idiots, but look at it this way. You probably got angry for nothing sometime in the past, too. So no worries. We're all dkheads"

ForeverAlone,fb8mo45,t3_ebmvh2,1576617217.0,"Let me put some perspective on this (sorry if this sounds like a smart aleck): 

Imagine you were a woman 300 or more years ago. You would have no rights and get told what to do. There was a high chance that someone would just come to your home, kill your family and rape you repeatedly. And there would be no justice for that. 

The complete contrast is today: In our western modern society what you say is true. Women have more biological value and therefore get treated better. But that is a logical consequence. What would be better: Women who have no rights. Or equal rights for everyone, but that leads to women being treated better?"

Well, I didn't do it, but it changed my perspective on life. I don't fear death anymore like I used to. In fact I would appreciate it if it happened right now. 

And I don't know, but righr now it feels pretty good. I am chasing death lol. Feels like the biggest freedom I ever had. Maybe  I will do it next year, maybe in a few, maybe never.
