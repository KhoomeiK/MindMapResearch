It's a complicated mixture of the bizarre nature of the culture nowadays, the disproportionate amount of attention women get along with the fatigue they face in weeding through an endless sea of assholish types, and I suspect my profile being underwhelming. I realize I'm a niche guy searching for other niche girls. I managed to find a few in the ballpark, and have homed in on one recently who I find really intruiging. We've been texting/calling for awhile now, though the inability to actually see each other is frustrating and kinda unfulfilling.

Dating requires a lot of persistence. You figure out what you're looking for and how to recognize it at a glance, then you sort through a thousand profiles sending messages or likes or whatever to anyone who seems promising and go through extensive trial and error until you find someone who meets your needs, feels the same about you, and is willing to undergo the extensive interpersonal labor of building a relationship."

Try your best to understand their uniqueness and find a midpoint between you two. 

You're not crazy, but feeling insecure and in need of reassurance. Your partner may not have the same level of enthusiasm currently, or may not have the same needs you're expressing. 

Personality types serve as a ballpark indicator, but are not predictive of any specific traits. INFPs can be wildly different people, so we can't simply project our own inner thoughts onto them and assume that we're both kindred spirits. There is much more to our identities than our types, so try not to rely on your intuition too much. 

Dating and early relationships should be a period of getting to know one another and exploring compatibility, not neccessarily deep emotional bonds or reliance. Those things should develop more over time, rather than be expected up front. If you lean too heavily on an unsteady post, you risk it falling through and getting hurt in the process.

Every type comes with its own unique properties, and you serve yourself best by playing to your strengths. 

At our worst we're antisocial, insecure, awkward, overly-emotional, unrealistic idealists, procrastinators, doormats. 

At our best we're bridge builders. We're able to understand ourselves and thus able to better understand others, and that allows us to smooth over conflicts and always find common ground. We're highly caring and can make excellent friends. Because we're idealistic we can often delve into possibilities others wouldn't consider, and are capable of amazing things. We're offbeat and unconventional. 

Sometimes I wish I was a thinker rather than a feeler. Sometimes I wish I was more disciplined and could stick to a schedule. Sometimes I wish I was more practical.

It's very difficult in my experience to find those type of connections. I initially discovered an outlet through mental health support groups where I made a number of online friends. I felt such a sense of unity with those people, but over time they mostly have all faded away. Even on dating sites though, we may be a rare breed but occasionally I'll come across someone who fits the bill. 

I'm not saying you can't have a platonic friendship that mostly fulfills this need outside of marriage, and you didn't really come looking for relationship advice, but if you feel your partner is lacking a certain fundamental quality that cannot be fulfilled I'd be concerned.

mentalhealth,fmdx3re,t3_funp95,1585980852.0,"Being aware of your ""rudeness"" and irritability is a great step toward self improvement, and you should take credit for that. Someone in a lesser position would still be blaming everyone else. I've seen it happen. 

The thing is merely being aware that you have a problem doesn't negate it, and that's where I believe your low self esteem is coming from. Our brains and feelings are mechanical, so if things aren't working properly it's almost certainly because you're not getting enough of something you need, not because you're inherently defective or inferior. This problem is a temporary condition, it's something external you're having to deal with and not a permanent character trait. Instead of thinking ""I hate myself / I hate my personality"" you can think ""I hate the circumstance that's causing me to be this way"". 

I wonder what's making you hypersensitive to annoyances? Is it lack of sleep, or poor diet? Poor social relationships? Stress, fatigue, depression? 

If you're able to determine what circumstances tend to produce these reactions, you can begin to form strategies to counteract them. It's all a complex puzzle you'll have to solve, and that can be daunting. However, I can tell from your post that you possess a thoughtful level of self-awareness, and this is likely something you'll be able to get a handle on in time. 

It really sucks that your insurance doesn't cover mental health. Our healthcare system in the US is a total joke and the recent craziness is certainly making that apparent. You deserve to have some assistance on this issue and it's a failing of our system that you don't.
