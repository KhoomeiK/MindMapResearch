BDSMcommunity,fr4lbfl,t1_fr4k266,1589891356.0,I actually haven’t. I wanted to write about how it had helped me accept my sexuality but when I went through the page it was all questions and complaints and I didn’t feel like it fit on the page so I left it.
BDSMcommunity,fr4juni,t1_fr4jr1c,1589890251.0,I see a great lack in positivity on many subs here. It’s really good to see how bdsm helps people.
BDSMcommunity,fr4ijci,t1_fr4hpu7,1589889209.0,I think that when explored properly bdsm helps you become a completely open minded person which in turn helps you accept many things about yourself.
BDSMcommunity,fr4h9x3,t3_gmipwp,1589888164.0,This was great to read! I’m happy bdsm has helped you so much.  It helped me accept my sexuality as a bi person which I have denied my whole life beforehand.

DDlgAdvice,fr1r3rr,t1_fr1jwqg,1589824516.0,When I learned that my little space was for me and my own happiness and daddy’s are lucky that we allow them to join in is when it became much easier to enjoy it alone.

ddlg,fr0ztdz,t3_glsjeb,1589810418.0,When I’m feeling needy but also don’t wana be a bother I send cute selfies or pics of drawing I’ve done etc. It gives daddy something to reply to without it being a forced conversation.
BDSMcommunity,fr0pna7,t3_glpkgh,1589803421.0,"Me and my Dom are monogamous but we met in a pretty vanilla way, tinder lol. Just lucked out that we matched sexually but it does happen!"
BDSMcommunity,fr0oo4v,t3_glmkyz,1589802609.0,"There is some amazing advice here, better than I can give but I just wanted to pipe in to say I think your handling it very well. Crying is healthy it lets out the grief and you will heal and be even stronger afterwards. As for him ghosting I know you say he’s a good man and maybe parts of him are but what he did is awful and I’m angry for you. Ghosting is cruel and in my opinion when done after a relationship has formed is a form of abuse. You deserve better and he does not deserve your submission."
DDlgAdvice,fr0ci8a,t3_gllzfv,1589790786.0,"I was having a similar issue with my daddy, I had to take control of my own little space and learn to enjoy it by myself then its an added bonus when daddy gets in the mood to join in. At first I didn’t like it at all I thought I needed him to trigger my space but tbh now I love my little alone time and the joy I get when daddy gets in daddy mode is so much better than when he used to try and force it for me. I wish he could he daddy 100% of the time sometimes but that’s not fair on him so we found a happy balance. Maybe work on learning to enjoy your space alone? Then your daddy won’t feel any pressure and you might find he joins in more often than now. X"

ABDL,fqwlpwr,t3_gkzxju,1589709103.0,I bound up to my daddy the other day loudly announced I was feeling little and wanted to wear a diapee and he started talking to me all daddy like. Then we had a convo about how I need more daipees. Once I was changed we suddenly realised his mic wasn’t on push to talk and his mates most likely heard it all. They never said anything but I don’t see how they didn’t hear. I’m still cringing 😂

DDLGDiscussions,fqma6wc,t1_fqm9ovr,1589474095.0,I agree that’s all part of communication. If you don’t listen then I’ll ya not going to work.

DDLGDiscussions,fqla0op,t3_gjd02x,1589451521.0,Well there’s some pretty mean comment here. You deserve respect and even daddy’s can feel bad about people being thoughtless it’s not immature at all. Who says a daddy has to suck it up and move on. When my daddy is upset I comfort him just a much as he comforts me. I got ghosted often for 2 years before I met daddy some people are just crappy that way. You’ll find your perfect little eventually and if they’re the type to ghost they’re not right anyway.
bisexual,fql9nsa,t3_gje8gy,1589451159.0,This is great to read Thankyou. I’ve been feeling like what was the point in coming out when I’m in a hetero relationship. Made me feel like an attention seeker even tho I’ve only told strangers online and my bf

bisexual,fqi5h7t,t1_fqi585c,1589390479.0,Yer I get that but labels are very important to some people. And it’s good to understand it fully. Ive found labels to be really helpful in understanding my own sexuality.
bisexual,fqi517y,t1_fqi4d6a,1589390224.0,Thankyou this is really clear. And yer pretty much what I thought but I’ve seen a lot of debate about it so got a bit confused.
DDlgAdvice,fqhvvly,t3_gj1dzo,1589385506.0,I sometimes get the need to be hurt when I get down. I think it’s because a) I’m a masochist and b) it gets me out of my head and all I can focus on is the sensations. It’s mostly heavy spanking I want although daddy won’t do it most of the time because he thinks I need positive reinforcement instead. We’ve settled on tickling as a middle ground. Still gets me out my head and he’s more comfortable with it. That being said if the punishment truly will help you and you and your daddy are both comfortable with it than there is nothing wrong with it at all. Just make sure it benefits you and doesn’t have a negative result.
ABDL,fqhddcx,t3_giryou,1589374545.0,I was 29 when I realised I was into ddlg and 30 for diapers. I just had no clue about any of it existing but when I discovered it wow everything made sense. There was one time when I was about 5 I remember being at a friends house who had a baby sister and stealing some diapers to take home with me. I wore one home and loved how sneaky I felt but then totally forgot about it for the next 25 years 😂
DDlgAdvice,fqhbzy1,t3_giqgmm,1589373631.0,I’m the same as get super shy so I write it down and give it to daddy to read. It means I get to edit it first and I can hide my face in a teddy while daddy’s has a read. It never goes badly. And I agree with the first 2 comments about dirty talk. You can only do what your comfortable with.
BDSMcommunity,fqdcn5l,t3_gi2ma1,1589286562.0,I think It’s an amazing balance of nurture and control. Check out r/ddlgdiscussions there an amazing community there that can help you figure it all out.

DDlgAdvice,fqd3tj2,t3_gi5h6c,1589278783.0,I was the same it felt weird at first but now it’s pretty much all I call him and it feels great for both of us. However it’s it always makes you uncomfortable there are plenty of other titles that have the same meaning as daddy. It can be whatever you are BOTH happy with.
littlespace,fqah4mb,t3_ghpfm5,1589218980.0,"I posted about something similar yesterday. I’d say it’s absolutely okay as long as your happy. I regress anywhere from baby to teen depending on my mood, tiredness and stress levels or what stimulation there is around me. It’s fun to do and helps me cope with anxiety. Whatever you do is the right thing to do because it’s yours ☺️"
littlegaming,fqa8skg,t3_ghf9o7,1589214845.0,"My time in Portia Is adorable, you said rune factory is on your radar I would highly recommend that too. Urm pretty much all pokemon games but the new mystery dungeon is so friken cuuute, animals crossing, harvest moon/ story of seasons, unravel is fun if you like side scrollers with a Bit of a difference. Ooh if you have a 3ds then fantasy life is amazing. Let me think there’s so many... oh Ori and the blind forest it’s sad but beautiful. Zelda games are pretty cute especially the remake of links awakening it’s all chibi characters. I’m sure There’s more lol."
littlespace,fq9j2x5,t3_ghjb6t,1589199725.0,You need to talk to her or youl burn out eventually. My daddy needs times where we support each other equally or sometimes where I take care of him and I’m happy to do that because i love him. You and your gf need to figure out a balance that is healthy for both of you not just her. Communication is so so important!

bisexual,fq1ft4z,t1_fq1fd9z,1589045265.0,Thankyou 🥰 my bf is my D/Dom and he is also bi so it’s not like I don’t have an understanding partner. Still nervous to talk about it with him tho.
bisexual,fq1e3mg,t1_fq1c7b3,1589044821.0,That has crossed my mind before or exploring with another couple. Keeping emotion out of it at least at first is something I want. I’m in the kink community and I gotta be honest my exploration of that plus my sexuality is a bit overwhelming but all encompassing at the same time. I wana figure it out so I can stop thinking about it if that makes sense. I didn’t admit my kinks until I met my bf so maybe he’s the reason I’m now starting to accept my bisexuality too. omg it’s so confusing 😂
bisexual,fq1bdh5,t1_fq1aqbb,1589044061.0,Haha threesome are a definite option for me something I’ve fantasies about for years 😂 I’m a coward tho and I rarely act on desires like this. I even turned a girl down once a few years ago because I was scared and have regretted it ever since. I wouldn’t even know where to begin 😂
bisexual,fq17xrn,t1_fq16gna,1589042997.0,Yer that’s makes a lot of sense. It certainly fits how I feel way better than anything else I’ve come across. A huge part of me is wondering wtf I’m doing. I’m very happy with my bf and I feel like this could potentially ruin it (or make us closer like I said he’s VERY open minded) but I can’t help but think more and more about the fact that Im attracted to women.
bisexual,fq17ijo,t1_fq16x2j,1589042825.0,"That’s okay it’s just I’ve only recently started focusing on this side of myself so don’t know all the terms yet. But yes my attraction does vary, sometimes I’m convinced I’m strait then other days I’m certain I’m not. It’s very confusing."
bisexual,fq1641w,t1_fq15kr8,1589042272.0,The bi cycle?
bisexual,fq14qky,t1_fq14115,1589041719.0,"It’s the varying that I’m starting to come to terms with, for a long time I’ve just assumed as it isn’t 50/50 then I was just strait and could appreciate an attractive woman. And yes in my alone time I prefer watching ff to mf videos. Feels more wholesome to me. I’m not single and would NEVER cheat but my bf is open minded and I think would be okay with me exploring this side of me. At least to a point. I feel like it’s not okay for me to say I’m bi for some reason, not that I have something against it but that I’m not welcome. So far tho I’ve been proven wrong except by the one person I thought would be the most accepting."
bisexual,fq13rig,t1_fq138t8,1589041342.0,Thankyou. I’ve never heard the term heteroromantic before I need to do some research. I am not single which makes these desires mere fantasy although we are both into bdsm and very open minded so i highly doubt he’d have a problem if I ever decided I wanted to explore it.
bisexual,fq136fg,t1_fq12h6x,1589041110.0,Wow this just made me cry your the first person to validate how I’ve been feeling. Thankyou so much! I’d give you an award if I had any money lol.

DDLGDiscussions,fq0w6wi,t1_fq0umbu,1589038401.0,I think for me it’s a combo of my tiredness levels and what I’m doing At the time. The more sleepy I am the more little I feel.
DDLGDiscussions,fq0vvj6,t1_fq0t9t0,1589038295.0,Yer I’m definitely at my happiest when I’m feeling childlike. My main problem is when I’m feeling middle I get bratty because suddenly daddy being in charge goes from something I desperately want to something I wana rebel against which drives him crazy as he is definitely not brat tamer 😂
DDLGDiscussions,fq0ugox,t3_ggad6s,1589037799.0,"The first comment says it all and I back up that advice 100%. I would like to reiterate that this man is a predator plain and simple and the healthiest thing for you to do is cut him out of your life completely and for good. People like him don’t deserve second chances or the benefit of the doubt. 

I’ve had someone get into my mind before (not at a young age however) and letting go after I left him was very difficult but trust me its possible and once you do your life will be infinitely better. 

18 is still very young, you have plenty of time to discover yourself and explore healthy adult relationships when you are ready. Try not to focus on the years wasted and instead look forward to a bright future."

DDlgAdvice,fprcbeq,t3_gewiau,1588849991.0,"You Can 100% be a daddy with depression. My daddy has depression and it doesn’t make me love him any less. Maybe even more now because he allows me to take care of him when he needs it, and it makes us closer. He is after all my parter before my Daddy.  Being vulnerable is sexy and opening up in my opinion is a very strong thing to do. I would advice you see a therapist if that’s possible for you tho and when you do meet a little/sub be open and honest because depressive behaviour when not understood can be misunderstood as not caring. My other advice is finding ways around your down days for instance my daddy has made me a bunch of recordings to remind me how much he cares when he isn’t able to talk. It puts my anxiety at ease and gives him the space he needs. I hope you start to feel a bit better soon and your luck turns around."

Anxiety,fpo4ulc,t3_gek4i6,1588778398.0,"I’d talk to a doctor if I were you this isn’t something the internet can 100% diagnose. However to me it’s sounds like anxiety attacks I have had where instead of the panic everything kinda slows and shuts down. It’s not true paralysis but feels a little like it. If your able to get up when it happens maybe try having a walk around your house, get a drink or something n then try bed again? I’m sorry I didn’t understand your description fully but if it’s similar to mine then that helps me."
Anxiety,fpo3w2k,t3_gejy5g,1588777913.0,"I have social anxiety alongside many other triggers. The main thing that helps me (and it’s a confusing one to deal with) is that I need the opportunity to not respond and to not feel guilty for that but also I’ve found myself feeling very lonely and sad because I have driven a lot of friends away so knowing somebody cares about me and is still my friend but without the pressure of having to respond is an absolute life saver. I have a couple of freinds who just send me the odd message like “love you” or rambling on about there own lives without asking me about mine and they are my least anxious messages to respond to. 

My biggest bad triggers are being asked why I’m anxious (it’s impossible to answer sometimes) and people telling me to just be happy, go for a walk youl feel better. That kinda thing. I know it would probs help but its just not an option sometimes. You sounds like a great friend, I’m sure just knowing she has you has a great positive influence on her anxiety."
