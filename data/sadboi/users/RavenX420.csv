Sometimes u dont have to just be straight up yea i stare hardcore cause my brain focusing on my hyper thoughts or just the vast blankness of nothingness.

The only kids who didnt r those who didnt care or didnt try to at least fake care lol. If u look like a semi hard worker u basically passed every class. (kinda like life) Tbh I havent experienced what everyone had after school cause my after school was video games all day. I wasnt raised to care about how to survive or live until I found out some stuff that forced me into that mindset. So Now I finally understand the ultimate struggle we all face and tye lack of understanding and education and laws that should be in place so society to sound stupid af like what that dude said in ur title. All almost 800,000k people need to sigh a petition and send it to the senate, state govts, and all across the USA to enforce certain rules for our help and bring awareness to the public.

Twitch,fosybwm,t3_g9eq8j,1588040616.0,Yes why not if u have to ask JUST DO IT ;D but be patient u aint gonna get 20 view in a month maybe if ur lucky but patience and a lot of advertising of ur stream. Twitter is great source for gaming/streaming id start there. Twitch is good platform and use regular obs for less cpu usage. Should hit ur CPU round 20-25% depending on ur pc specs. internet is key if u dont have a beast computer. Ethernet is best
Drugs,for4mgn,t1_fop9n5e,1588006089.0,It be like that sometimes. I can still control myself while drunk but some things tend to slip. Its all about what part of the brain/nerons these substances r activating. I find too that when ur dopamine/serotonin is raised to a certain degree it obvious takes away anxiety and makes it easier to speak without actually feeling the negative side effects ya kno

Drugs,fop6061,t3_g8rmin,1587953843.0,Dis is Why they sometimes call it a truth serum.  Its tbh in my opinion meant for not only partys(which can be highly dangerous if not hydrated) or for therapeutic purposes. Ya just want to chill with a friend n just talk bout life or whatever.

Anxiety,fo6wntx,t3_g62gsx,1587568116.0,This is why the human race needs to invest their tike in learning the basics of survive skills. Tbh r kids get of school not even knowing how to pay a phone bill. So at least they can teach us how to grow our own food. Its probably the safest and healthiest way to live better get on that read grind. And invest in some garden tools just wait there will be a day when heating/cooling will shut down for months then what? No one knows how to use reusable energy so the only ones who r saved r those who built like a wind power or have built/bought solar power.

Drugs,fllyp86,t1_fllxbw7,1585270597.0,Im sorry but if u know how to properly use it to ur mental health advantage than ur depression wont be so horrible in the long run. And tbh most the time i come down off E (alone) I feel more um uplifted! Now always down. You should read some articles on how MDMA can really help a person mentally when used in the right set and setting
weed,fllwy84,t1_fllwg2f,1585269496.0,Then ur the perfect culprit cause why would u suspect him of  jippin u right? cause he nev has before? I fell for it couple times people change & at the end of the day even if u kno ur dealer personally they can and would screw u over. But this is not a definite i mean it could have been out of his hands. He may have been sold a bad batch who knows right? Thats the dealer life
spirituality,fllwbu3,t3_fpizg1,1585269112.0,I dont believe natural selection is horrible. Everything has a way of balancing even if its bad. We harm animals so dont harm ourselves to find the best medication to prong our life span. Thats not right nor far but in logical sense it does bring a balance to our selfishness gain. So i mean if mother earth wants to send out a virus to kill us why not? Technically we could be the cause of our own destruction. For ex. Climate change (we caused) is melting the icebergs away. What do u think lies dormant in that ice? Millions of bacteria that can wipe us out. Like. Black Plague but whos fault is it really?

weed,fllvq19,t3_fpmxje,1585268746.0,Its not uncommon to get tainted up weed. Especially with this virus everyone trying to save or earn a buck. He prob added something to it. Was it a dub or an 8th? cause u can look up pick and weigh it to see if it accurate.
LSD,fllvhvr,t3_fpmzfq,1585268608.0,I had a similar experience with ur time frame. I tripped just as hard BUT i kept the tike frame up and my tolerance lvl was rising so the trip weakened. Thats why they be like wait 2weeks. So dont take it often cause u will risk raising ur tolerance. I bet if u popped both tabs u‚Äôll still have  similar to ur last. One im not so sure.
spirituality,fllv63p,t3_foqz64,1585268407.0,Okay im reading a lot of fighting back darkness and gloominess but did u ever think that there may be something to learn from this situation? Maybe something from ur dad? Im not saying its gonna be an instant light bulb epiphany. But in darkness there is always light. Ying and yang balance and stuff! Find the light between u and ur dads relationship what use to or what might grab his interest and work with that. Sometimes it can be simply sitting and watching tv and letting him rant about life. There could be something in there that you can relate to. But thats just ex. Theres so many other things to do.
spirituality,flluq5y,t3_fp265h,1585268134.0,U have a gift of sight. So do i. Im getting use to the psychic stuff. But sometimes like not everything is as straight forward as u described. I think ur spirit just made it clear so u can finally start understanding what ur really capable. Just wait ur gonna get dreams that dont make sense or r like riddles or puzzle pieces. For ex. You might see your mom go crazy and start arguing with lets say ur dad. But reality she probably just trying to solve something in her head between her and ur dad. I hope that made sense
spirituality,flluaam,t3_fotaf3,1585267869.0,Absolutely. Sometimes it feels like shit and other times it feels great. End result is me just cuddling with something or my dog
spirituality,fllu5pu,t3_fpizg1,1585267801.0,U cant automatically say something or someone is evil without proper facts or proof. There is scientific proof that earth is alive full of energy going to many different organisms including humans. I wouldnt call giving us fresh food evil. Whats evil is the human race manipulating the earth and using it to their advantage without a care of the consequences it could have to not only us but the planet itself.

ADHD,fjddp1x,t3_fcw9n0,1583251164.0,"Yes i totally acted like this. But i got traumatized from society because no one is educated in how to handle adhd kids.  Say try to explain to him to be less loud and to pace himself before saying what he needs to say. Think about it and then say but even I still struggle to do it especially in high tense situations where I need to answer fast. Why I hated the game jeopardy.  Its gonna take a lot of patience and repetition but if ur kid will eventually understand how to ‚Äúproperly‚Äù speak. & will find his own group. Everyone does & he exploring his social skills so it may take time or none at all. Ya either click or ya dont and most of u dont think twice unless you‚Äôve had feeling of abandonment. I hope this um helped. 
Its all about communicating to him sometimes using games as a way of learning is the best cause i find if we hear the same thing over and over again we wont retain it anymore cause we get ‚Äúbored‚Äù and that not like us trying to be mean its just how our brains work.
