raisedbyborderlines,fi54h43,t3_f6b1sm,1582154728.0,"Similarly to other commenters, I have not been tested for ASD, but I spent a few years working with children with ASD and realized that a lot of their maladaptive behaviors were quite similar to ones I showed as a kid, and to some extent very similar to those my uBPD mom exhibits to this day. I don't want to diagnose myself or my mom (though I guess I already have while being on this sub/using the term ""uBPD""), but I definitely see the similarities between my mom, myself, and the textbook behaviors of folks with ASD. 

I don't know if I necessarily think either of us have ASD. I think my mom has extreme, constant, every day anxiety, and I think growing up in that environment required me to adapt in ways that worked with her specific needs. I have a documented anxiety disorder, depression, and cPTSD, which I think can explain the behaviors I have that I think are reminiscent of ASD. That all being said, I wouldn't be opposed to being screened for ASD, nor would I be especially shocked if I recieved that diagnosis.

I do have a really hard time with social situations, and am really bad at reading the emotions of others, but I have attributed this mostly to trying to read my mom (unsuccessfully) for so many years. There's others, but every time I start thinking that I may be on the spectrum because of one or more of my behaviors, I am able think of a trauma-related explanation. I think certain coping mechanisms for trauma are maybe very similar to certain ASD symptoms? I'm not an expert, but that's kind of what i've noticed."

Eventually your dog will become a part of your routine. Taking care of his needs will become something you just do every day, kind of without thinking. His needs will stop being chores, they'll be activities for you two to do together. 

Beyond this, the best part of owning a dog is that they very quickly become your biggest fan. Nothing makes me feel better than coming home from a long day to my dog wagging her tail so hard it looks like she's dancing. Dogs and humans have evolved together. There are studies to suggest they can interpret human emotion, even laughter, and respond to it. My dog, even though she's not trained to do this at all, knows when I'm about to have a panic attack and comes right to my side. 

This is all to say that the first few weeks are usually really hard, but if you can get over that hump, the rest is extremely rewarding and fun. 

Also, dog training isn't super hard to do at home. There's several good youtube channels dedicated specifically to dog training, and most dogs only require 15-20 minutes of training a day to get started.

AskReddit,ffacrmd,t1_ff94vns,1579732487.0,"This is basically what I was thinking. I had my first real depressive episode at 13 and had a hard time keeping friends as a result. I'd probably just take little me to Hot Topic, buy her a stupid fucking shirt, and then just be her friend for a day. Jam to some of our favorite music from that time, dye our hair blue, and just live a little. I think she and current me could both use some of that."

She called and said she would fly home immediately to attend the funeral, but all of us agreed that grandpa would be angrier about her wasting money than he would about her not attending the funeral. She didn't fly home, missed the funeral, and no one ever mentioned it."
AmItheAsshole,ff7if8y,t1_ff6au05,1579650284.0,"See, I vote YTA because of the way OP delivered the ""no"". If she really felt strongly about not wanting to go, she could have made up a lie or some other nicety, but saying ""we're not that close"" is a real painful way to decline the offer. I've declined offers from coworkers for similarly large events, but only with the understanding that I was not the only person they could contact for help/support. 

I've been alone in a big city with a new job before. I struggle to make friends, too, and would be completely crushed if someone declined by saying ""we aren't that close"". This ultimately tells her that you have no interest in being a friend when she clearly needs one, which I think is especially shitty. I would probably never talk to OP again because of the way she declined the offer. The coworker probably knows they aren't close (since they never got together outside of work) and still doesn't have other, closer friends to ask.

In this situation, I think even a ""I really don't like dress shopping, but will go if you need a friend to come along"" would have been better. I've found, in the short time I've been an adult, that sometimes you just need to be a pretend friend for people. Adulthood is lonely, and sometimes we need to be someone for someone else, even if we don't want to."

Sometimes I will make a comment about something my mom has done or is doing that is frustrating and people will try to be helpful by suggesting things like talking to her about the issue. This is not possible.

At work, we have a long office closure over Christmas, and it's normal for folks in our office to ask each other's plans over that break. So many of my coworkers were excitedly going to visit their families and came back from the long break energized and fresh. I also went to see my family for the holidays, and in contrast, came back more tired and stressed than before the break! Some of my colleagues noticed and were all ""what, you didn't have a good time with your family?"" Actually, I did, but a ""good time"" with my family is not a good time in comparison to my regular, everyday life."

raisedbyborderlines,fea4j5x,t3_eo4d6e,1578944296.0,"Congratulations! This is a big deal, and I'm glad you've been able to come to this idea. 

I struggle with the same issue - ""she's my mom, I have to"". She has destroyed every major friendship she has ever had, and every time she comes to me talking about how I am her best friend, I'm the only person who understands her, being a mother is the only thing that makes her happy. It's hard."
raisedbyborderlines,fe9zza2,t1_fe5lrx5,1578942985.0,"Yes! My mom used to gaslight me into thinking my childhood and relationship with her was normal. ""Why would you tell your friends that? You're making me look like a bad mom!""

I have an objective and obvious fear of abandonment. In college, I made one of my best friends of my entire life and the first thing my mom said when she met her (to my friend's face!!) was ""I wonder how long it will take before courtneat pushes you away"". She wasn't wrong that I hardly maintain friendships past a few months, but what a horrible thing to say to my new friend.

My mom also had this way of being an objectively good mother figure to my friends. Almost to the extent where I was jealous. One of my friends was largely left to her own devices in middle school (her sister died years earlier and her parents didn't cope well) and her grades started dropping significantly as a result. My mom started checking in with my friend, asking about her grades and talking to her about her problems. At one point we all went out for ice cream because my friend had gotten good grades. I was happy for her, but why was my mom more supportive of her than me? 

These two things kept me from acknowledging the problems I had growing up. I have a friend who I've known for over 10 years, who is very familiar with my mom (from a distance). When I told him of the trauma and everything I'd gone (and am still going) through, he said he believed me, but that it was ""hard because [my mom] has always been so nice and supportive""."
raisedbyborderlines,fdsr8qk,t3_ems83j,1578706905.0,"Yes! It eventually got to the point where I would compulsively tell her things because I was afraid she knew. I didn't have a ton of friends growing up because I felt completely obligated to share everything with my mom. 

I distinctly remember once when I was about 10 when my friends wanted to get milkshakes at a restaurant across a major thoroughfare from our neighborhood. I wasn't allowed to cross this particular road without my parents yet, but I went with my friends anyway without my mom's permission.  On the way back, despite the fact that there was literally no evidence I'd done this, I had a panic attack and called my mom to confess. She went completely ballistic and told all of my friends' parents and they all got in trouble, too. One of them was grounded for the entire summer. No one wanted to be my friend after that. 

When I got my first real boyfriend and things were getting serious, she trapped me in a long car ride with her until I confessed to having sex. When I begged her not to tell my dad, she promised she wouldn't and then did anyway. 

Even now in adulthood I feel compulsed to share things with her. Sometimes I have to stop myself and ask if she actually needs to know or if I feel that way because she's made me feel that way. My mom was always ""you can tell me anything and I will be here for you"" and whenever I would trust that she meant that, she would remind me that I can't trust her with my secrets by either blowing up or sharing my secret with as many people as she could."
