In any case, cheers - thanks for being a good person."
SuicideWatch,eojftia,t3_bs4wb7,1558637307.0,"It is very sudden, and very brutal. People often don't think of suicide as 'being visited by violence', but in every sense that matters, it is horrifically violent. It feels like a bomb just went off, and as though your life will never be the same again. And it won't. This will change you forever... just make sure it only changes you for the better.  


That's probably not what you want to hear right now, but I have been there, and this was the lesson I learned from it, every time. It will likely be soon that you start counting your blessings, and appreciate everyone, and everything, just that little bit more.  


I'm really sorry this has happened to you. Warmest regards in this terrible time for you."
