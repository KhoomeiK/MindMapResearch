vegan,fqror5g,t1_fqrnqlv,1589588701.0,"agreeeeeed!!! also, it‚Äôs actually my preferred burger substitute, over beyond and impossible because of the price and how good they are. my omni friends were so impressed!! they have a good texture and flavor, like a grilled burger. i‚Äôve had them cooked in a skillet and on the grill and loved them both ways!"

you are not disgusting. you are worthy of having peace and a good relationship with the food and your body."
Codependency,fnawaj4,t3_g0k7kt,1586804947.0,"as someone who has struggled a lot with self harm and codependency, i can relate and i sympathize. i think it‚Äôs brave, with a lot of self awareness and honesty, to realize you need to take a step back from a relationship for your mental health. i am doing the same right now and while it is hard, i have seen a different side of myself. 

i do recommend you talk to someone close, as well as a health care professional. these things are hard. you don‚Äôt have to struggle alone and without the resources to help yourself grow."

congrats and keep going!"
