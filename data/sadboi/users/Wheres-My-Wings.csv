I'm not stupid.

Ignoring that I'm immunocompromised and part of the at-risk group, if I got someone sick, and they became no longer living, I'd feel like poop. These protesters don't care. It was brought up to me that there are people that would protest Jurassic Park/World being closed because the dinosaurs got out and were killing people. So it's a lose-lose. History repeats, and any severe outbreak like this, like Spanish Flu for example, killed more the second time around than the first. People like this are the cause. Yes we are all bored. Yes 99% of us need haircuts. It isn't worth risking others in my opinion."

Your MIL sounds like she won't stay 6 ft away however despite being a RN. The fact she won't stop asking to come over says enough. Ask her to video chat instead. If she refuses, then tell her outright that she won't see them any other way. Tell her you don't want your babies sick and remind her that she can carry it even if she has no symptoms. No one is immune to this. As a nurse, she should know. Tell her you'll never forgive her if she gets them sick, even if the worst does not happen."

This constant feeling of ""mama's having a baby"" ""grandma and daddy are mad at me"" ""are we gonna move again?"" is what Furbaby feels. Giving them a break away from stress would help a lot.

Luke had really flaky, itchy skin. Get vaseline and put some behind his ears each night, then every few nights when it clears up. He also had wounds from scratching. Theres a kind of neosporin gel that is safe for them. Water based I think. Use that. Make sure to keep chew toys in the cage to keep their teeth from growing too much. Finally, make sure to give them vitamins. I had some vitamin treats I gave Luke to help his joints and overall health good. Hope this helps."

Pet store hamsters are usually too young to be territorial yet, but it won't take long. My late boy Luke (RIP) was kept in plastic storage boxes I made into cages. One had mesh and the other had holes drilled in for air (my room is kept cold because I am not a fan of sleeping when its hot). He was quite happy with it. Would highly recommend. They are cheaper and bigger than regular cages. Connect tubes to them using duct tape so they don't cause an escape.

Do this. Film/record her. If you have to tell her, do it flippantly and make her forget you are. Bring up the tattoo. Tell her no. Record her manipulation.

Hamsters can be allergic to wood shaving bedding. So can humans. It carries a LOT of dust. Plus I don't like the idea of splinters. I used Oxbow paper bedding. Its soft, absorbent, barely any dust (none are perfect), and Luke loved it. It's a little expensive (17 USD) but WORTH IT!!! I and Luke were allergic the Carefresh and Kaytee paper bedding. With Oxbow, there are also no dyes.

If you stick with wood shavings, pay attention to you and Hamster. Do you sneeze more? Does Hamster sneeze and/or scratch a lot? That's how I figured it out with Luke not liking Carefresh, and me too. 

My younger sister (YS) had a hamster before I did (RIP Ginger) (she had to talk me into it lol) and she had wood shavings. She sneezed lot and Ginger itched and scratched and YS found out that wood shavings do that a lot. I started buying her and myself Oxbow bedding (Chewy .com) and they got better. 

Wood shavings? DON'T RECOMMEND!!!!! Paper bedding? RECOMMENDED!!!!!"

relationship_advice,fc14z98,t3_efauim,1577308410.0,"As a woman, reading this, I see two possibilities: jealousy, or attraction. 

I fully support your reason for losing weight.

Going the jealousy route, it's easy to deny being jealous. She has seen you lose weight easily before, and may be envious that it's so easy for you, and difficult for her, but is too embarrassed to admit it, even to you. I'm fighting with my own weight loss, both for health reasons and my clothes not fitting right, and got jealous myself when you said you lose weight easily. LOL.

Going the attraction route, she may find that you are more attractive when you are heavy. I know some people that I feel look better heavy than skinny, but that is my own opinion. She may be finding that she likes you better heavy, and is having trouble accepting the skinnier you.

Definitely go to counseling. Bring this up. I imagine you have told her your reason for losing weight.....right? Get her opinion. Help her to understand your reason. Listen to her opinion, too. If she still refuses to listen...its up to you. Just remember it'll hurt her BAD if you cheat. Trust me. I know.
