unpopularopinion,fqp7jso,t1_fqp7c1m,1589537836.0,"I absolutely agree that older movies have do have awesome effects that were often done by hand and super detailed. My point is that sometimes when a different director gets their hands on it, it can make it a really awesome experience, or music is added and used in a new way, or they remove some of the more problematic things of the original, it can be just as good as the original. And also, movies are made for the time. The older movies are often best enjoyed by people who were around when they were made because they connect to it better."
