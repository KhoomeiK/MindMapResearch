Back in high school, I had a lovely Spanish teacher, let’s call her Ms A. Ms A was in her late 20s and was loved by all her students, as not only was she a great teacher but also a great listener if you ever had to talk to her about anything. On Valentine’s day she gave the entire class chocolates and told us she loved us all. We all found it to be a super sweet gesture. Right after Ms A’s class I had math with Mr B. Mr B was a middle aged man, a great teacher and very well loved but I couldn’t imagine him giving out chocolates to kids, especially on Valentine’s day, or him telling us he loved us. It just seemed... wrong. That’s when I realized how small actions can be interpreted differently depending on the gender of the teacher. It’s unfair, really."

I think it’s a product of my black and white thinking: either i’m hot shit, or I’m ugly and unattractive. I try to recognize my black and white thinking whenever I feel either of two ways and remind myself that objectively I think I am decent looking, and wearing clothes that suit my body type make me look good.

BPD,flu53hl,t3_fr6uyu,1585495408.0,Relatable. It upsets me so much when people talk about their childhood best friends or high school friends and how they are still super close to them.

BPD,flu4p23,t3_fr6vol,1585495152.0,"Yup I completely relate. People call it “attention seeking behavior” and guess what, they are absolutely correct. I do want someone to give me their attention, to take care of me, to hug me and say it’s going to be ok. Being affection starved can make us do extreme things. Unless I hurt myself badly, no one will notice me or feel sorry for me. When I was younger, a lot of the time my parents ignored me/refused to engage with me and that affected me a lot. Now I provoke people when I need affection or reassurance instead of just asking for it like a normal person."
