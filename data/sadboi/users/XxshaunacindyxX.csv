You just have to, it shows you're confident and brave and dominant, girls like that, it's how's her you can protect her etc. Old psychological patterns coming into play.
Guys if you flirt with a girl more than likely she'll catch feelings.
I liked this guy and he's kinda shy so he never texts or talks first and it's painful because I know he likes me, but girls just want it proven, if you text her first it shows her you want her.
See I had another guy who text me all the time and was really talkative, he told me I was pretty so obviously I developed a massive crush on him.
Like it's just your presence makes someone develop a crush because the more your present in their mind, the more they think about you. So talk!"

He went onto Instagram saying fuck girls all they tryna do is mess with you and have fun, I was trying to create a relationship but he didn't even care about me and then went on to say I was leading him in because we kissed and then i wouldn't have sex with him. I'm interested, not a whore you know, obviously he had different intentions. But he misinterpreted that and flipped it back on me. I didn't say I was unitntersted in him I wanted to get to know him as a person, guys never want you for you.
In my opinion this girl got scared shed get hurt or she was being reckless and decide she needed to stop before it got too serious because she wasn't emotionally stable. If she seemed genuine that's probably it. Girls are emotional."
dating_advice,f7wqx78,t3_dxuuee,1574036532.0,I would also like to know this
dating_advice,f7wq1l0,t3_dxuv7f,1574036206.0,"Its so true sadly, I think because of very basic things, guys like feminine women right, guys love girl on girl action because its hot for some reason, idk why they like that Its a major problem for lesbians, anyway!
Women like masculine men they want a protector someone who will defend them at whatever cost.
I think bisexual men might not necessarily fit that bill for alot of women, coming across as more soft. Now that's just a generalisation but every Bi guy I know has this sort of feminity to him. My friend dated a Bi guy and really liked him but when I talked to him he was like a gay best friend to me although he has a deep voice, he just acts differently and I think it's that blurred line of him seeming gay that puts women off. Because if I was to introduce him to my parents you know they'd think he was gay. Same with another friend not gay but Bi but all his friends parents call him gay because he just seems more that way than straight. So if a straight woman was to talk to them they initially seem gay. It just suggests a lack of dominance for the woman if they can both cry over a Rom com, it leaves her wondering how he'll be in the bedroom. But some people love it, me and my sister swear my uncle is Bi because he's so eccentric and I mean he speaks fluent French, okay that was another generalisation and a joke! But even with all eccentricities he's married to my aunty and I'm telling you they have one of the best marriages ever because the two of them are so emotional and bitchy together.
I think for Bi woman it's the same because they can still be really feminine as there's fem lesbians etc so men still find that appealing. But there are those Bi girls with riskier voices and a bit more badass in them, which are more drawn to girls and less attractive to guys. But can also still be attractive to different types of men. But you see the whole feminity masculinity of a person really plays into it and at the end of the day you can't really change people's attraction Because maybe bisexual men is not their preference even if them themselves are bisexual. Its odd it's very odd taht it occurs but psychologically it makes sense. You won't end up alone I promise you that many bisexual men are in a relationship with a Woman, you've probably just not met the right one yet."

dating_advice,f7wkuzf,t3_dxuoae,1574034393.0,"OH MAN, okay let me tell you from the girls point of view, for me I have an Instagram friend who is a boy and then and Instagram now Snapchat boy who let's just say we met up and eh stuff! 
So the first guy I swiped up to the things he'd post because we had similar interests such as songs or pictures of actors he'd repost and I'd just say as love them or something and then he'd do the same for me and we'd get to talking and we talk everyday now and to be honest he's the best online friend I've ever had, but he said he didn't want to compliment any actual pictures I put up because he didn't want to be weird which I super respect.
The second boy added me, knew an old friend apparently, straight away he went through my highlights and DM'd me, started off with emojis and shit, classic fuckboy and normally I'd be turned off especially if the account was worldstargymboy with a pic of him flexing his muscles but it wasnt it was a chill well thought out insta and he was fine as hell so obviously I'd liked the message, he didn't text until I text back which is good because boundaries. We talked for ages he actually wanted me to old school call him on the phone, and we talked for hours and then we added each other in SC and the rest is history I guess.
Swipe up on her INTERESTS make her feel valid as a person first not an object but if you think she's beautiful tell her that it'll make her day :-) but don't ever expect anything from her as she doesn't owe you anything."

So I was talking to him we went for a walk to the beach one day and he was fluent in French so obviously I was trying to get him to say something for me, which of course he wouldn't ahhahaha, but he told me when he goes to France people think he's a foreigner and he can hear them talking racist things about him everywhere he goes. I was really in shock, I mean obviously the French are assholes, sorry if your from France! Fellow European here! But like the things they said, like if only he'd ever go back to his country etc. Honestly it surprised me, because I wouldn't never think of racism in everyday life like that obviously effecting me, obviously I was like damn fuck that dumb bitch but he said he just kept walking, and that's why i like him, level headed, even when he's treated that way, you can think it's not real but racism very truly is, to me it sounds like some of those girls are dumb af and others are just ignorant, I think you just want life, why talk about skin colour if its really not necessary, I think the only thing that's important in an interracial relationship is understanding of hardship and cultures and having the up most respect for them, if you live in a 90% white are, these people wouldn't have had much contact with black people if you get me so they're just ignorant of your behaviours and want to act like they know your ""culture"" because black culture is a very real thing and it should be celebrated, it seems like some of these girls just want to try and partake in it but in the wrong way, or maybe your just dating dumb women Idk, but here I am a white blonde girl extremely interested in this boy who just happens to be from another country and to be honest I just like listening to him talk and he talks about his culture so I'm extremely interested in it and totally respect it."

What's meaningful to you, when you think of a meaningful life what do you want.
Draw a mind map. And don't tell yourself you can't have it. Dont tell yourself that other people have more meaningful lives than you. Because it's not true. Every single human is capable of amazing things, just like everyone is capable of murder. You create who you are, I think that's what I was trying to say, obviously for me freedom is the most meaningful thing to me. You find what that is for you and you stick and commit to It, you work hard everyday and treat yourself right. Take a bath watch a movie and then work at your life.

Love works exactly like that, it's not what you have, its who you are to them and them to you.
On the other hand my friend needs to be in a relationship constantly to feel valid and her and her boyfriend are constantly fighting and crying over her issues and I think she puts too much on him in all honesty, because trying to make a depressed person feel okay is impossible if they don't really want to.

When your depressed you feel empty right. They're both pretty much void of emptiness right? But death is a permanent void. Still living even while depressed makes more sense to me because if you want to die you feel like you have nothing to lose, you can basically do anything you want at that point. You don't want a job? Fuck a job! You get to decide what you want to do, tell that person you think is pretty thta they are, if they don't like your compliment oh well, nothing to lose, pride? Where's that if your dead. Think about it if you were dead you wouldn't care about pride, so just act that way in your living life have all the care in the world as a dead person but don't die. Because if your dead nothing. But if you're alive with nothing to lose. It does open many new doors and experiences and maybe by just not giving a fuck and doing whatever you want while living you might find a reason to actually live..."

It was really nice, cleared my head. 
We really vibed.

We sat in this shelter that's on a cliff walk and it was just after sunset so the sky was a sapphire blue, the beach was below us and the land wraps around so there was beach ocean and then land, dotted with millions of warm lights. He said it was really nice, he was glad we came here.
He kept joking about how romantic a walk on the beach was.

Things escalated.
And we got caught in the rain.
Sounds like a movie if im being honest.

Our eyes were like magnets, I couldn't stop staring at him.
He kept kissing me randomly.
I was shaking from the cold so he opened his jacket and held me in it.


We're still texting but I dont know if that's it for us and we move on from it.
I acted like i didnt care, I dont think he thought i cared too much, but actually I really do...and now idk what to do, it sounds awfully romantic but, he's an 18 year old boy he's not looking for romance if you get me... got really mixed vibes of what he wants us to be so I'll have to wait and see."

If your mother is insecure she'll just take it you need to fire the shots babe, If you don't wanna tell him to fuck off atleast call him out and say why did you say that? And react negatively to him everytime he does it, give him a bad look everytime. It shows him that he doesn't have support and most importantly he'll feel a lack of control, tell your mother to do the same and if he continues it's abuse and basically tell him to leave.
