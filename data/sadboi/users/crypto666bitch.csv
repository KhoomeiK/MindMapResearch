skinsTV,fm1hqlx,t3_fscpw0,1585678640.0,honestly i enjoyed every generation. the third gen was definitely set up a bit differently than the first and second but i found it make it interesting and i still really enjoyed it more than i expected to
skinsTV,fly7ybf,t3_frt9wz,1585597203.0,cook and effy. they were more alike. freddie’s experience with his mom made effy a little dangerous for him imo. like he threw his whole heart into helping her and it ended up costing him his life.
cocaine,flmog8p,t3_fprj2h,1585290290.0,"i feel like it’s kind of important to try to not think of it as ‘justifying’ yourself to your friends because at the end of the day you have complete control over what you decide to put in your body, period. i’ve recently had an experience with my 2 closest friends letting me know they’re really worried, and it didn’t occur to me that i hadn’t really updated them. they just saw that i was using, they didn’t know i was aware of the fact that it’s risky and i need to detox my body and take at least a good break from it soon. before i could explain that one of my friends got extremely angry with me as i attempted to explain that the stigma and criminalization behind drugs like cocaine when drugs like alcohol and nicotine are overlooked. now i get these things don’t equate, but the point was that criminalizing and stigmatizing it all (especially without any first hand experience with it) and assuming things about those of us who do choose to use these drugs, will ultimately end up doing us way more harm than good. their reaction kind of made me find myself ‘defending’ the drug more than i even meant to or wanted to because their reactions, and made me rethink being completely honest with them about this stuff. hopefully this all kind of makes sense but basically what i’m trying to say is i think it’s important to explain to your friends and loved ones what works and what doesn’t in terms of how they can help you stay safe during this period of usage. stay lifted & healthy! ✨"

skinsTV,flfsurk,t3_fod0oe,1585116544.0,ok wait she slept with cook after thomas said he had to go back to the congo because his mom was pissed so i don’t rly think that’s cheating. she should have been honest off the bat tho... but thomas cheated too. 90% of these horny ass teenagers on this show are cheaters. she was an angel imo and everyone constantly underestimated her and she ended up surprising everyone at the end. her and thomas are both pure af and i love them both 😩🥺

skinsTV,fks18ob,t1_fks0zr8,1584480175.0,THIS! i always thought of her as a member of both generations but i definitely preferred her in the first generation. it took me a minute to warm up to the second generation but i kept going for effy and pandora because we already knew them. and then i started appreciating the second gen when i got farther into it and effy started to annoy me a little. it would have been neat if they had tony in the background of the second generation maybe helping her through her shit at some point. i think i was just more put off that she made effy and freddy do the MOST for her and then her psycho therapist murdered freddy and it was just a whole mess for me LMFAO
skinsTV,fkrw2dp,t1_fkrvtm0,1584477184.0,i think for me tony became a good person in my eyes after the accident. i feel like effy didn’t really get that chance to have a redemption because she started hitting rock bottom near the end of her generation. also i had a soft spot for freddy and i just wish she wouldn’t have fucked him around as much as i feel she did. i hate the overhype of effy but she is definitely on the cusp of being good tier for me.
skinsTV,fkrvb9b,t1_fkrug3u,1584476753.0,also i haven’t finished the third gen i haven’t seen a ton of stuff about alex so maybe when i finish this generation things would change a little
skinsTV,fkruq4x,t1_fkrug3u,1584476418.0,i think i just put effy there because most people put her really really high and i like her but she went through a lot of questionable periods and i don’t think she’s as amazing as people think. for me she’s more borderline ok/good tier. also i agree fuck frankie i had big hopes for her character. thought maybe she was gonna be a queer or trans storyline but then she just turned out to be a bit sociopathic and very immature.
skinsTV,fkrt4ha,t3_fkc0bn,1584475502.0,i'm almost finished the third generation. i'm glad i waited til now to do this because initially i thought i would love franky which was a complete letdown... i was ready to put her near the top before they went a completely different direction with her character than what i had expected/hoped

skinsTV,firuzqz,t3_f9hvyz,1582671711.0,"well, no, because i think the whole idea was that he had an absentee douchebag of a father who couldn’t, or didn’t, provide him with anything. and then in contrast he has a selfish mother who had all the resources and then some to take care of him properly while he was growing up, but didn’t want to have him around as he reminded her of his father. she thought of him as a bastard child who was a mistake and a burden. i think it kind of speaks to why he is the way that he is. when you have a character like chris, who has 2 shitty parents, that’s all he knows is shitty conditions. he knows that neither of them really had anything to give. but cook has a shitty parent with no resources to raise his son, and then a parent who could absolutely help him and provide for him, and neither of them are doing so. i always thought that was why cook was more angry, aggressive, and impulsive than chris was. his mom and dad are ultimately both dickheads, but in 2 completely different ways under 2 completely different sets of circumstances."
skinsTV,ficbf5f,t1_ficb9rk,1582342398.0,makes sense! i just always took that storyline as less of him hating maxxie for being gay and more him not wanting to tell his dad (when maxxie said he wouldn’t go to his party unless he told his dad) because he knew his dad had more traditional beliefs? idk i just thought it was more him wanting to avoid his dad potentially disliking his best friend because of his sexuality.

skinsTV,fi7zwrv,t1_fi5kzu0,1582230891.0,"haven’t seen the 3rd gen yet, i’m just starting it now so i can’t speak on those characters. but in terms of 1st gen i would have loved if they developed maxxie’s story a little more. his biggest storyline was pretty much just relying on sketch. also if they had explored jal’s backstory a little more it could have been interesting. for the 2nd gen i would have liked to have seen them develop JJ’s storyline a bit more just because i have a soft spot for him. maybe also katie just because a lot of her storyline just relied on her family and how she treated emily. but sketch was definitely the most underdeveloped character imo, but they did wait to introduce her until later in the season so i guess it makes sense.

mind you this is just me being nitpick-y. one of the things i noticed from the get go with skins was their ability to fit what seemed like 5 season worth of content into 2 seasons per generation. i think they did amazingly in general with character development but of course some characters weren’t as looked into and seemed more like secondary characters in that sense."

BipolarReddit,fhhx4tu,t1_fhgeyoh,1581613488.0,"i don’t 100% remember the dose, but it was definitely just a small dose that they put you on when you’re first starting the medication (either 25mg or 50mg? they had started me on seroquel at the same time as well so i forget which one was which dose). but the rash started about 3 days after i started the medication. it began as a small rash on my inner arms and eventually within about 24 hours my entire upper body was covered, including my pelvic region, under my armpits, my entire abdomen, etc. it was super uncomfortable, the rash was really itchy and dark. my psychiatrist was shocked when i showed it to her, so i guess the lamotrigine rash that i got was maybe bigger and more dramatic than the rash people usually get from it? either way i stopped taking it, went to my family doctor, and she prescribed me a low dose of steroids and the rash started to clear up. although it did take about a week+ for it to completely go away, and even then i had some darker, dry patches on my skin for a couple more weeks after that."

Drugs,fe3yj31,t3_dn2uiv,1578854006.0,"coke literally gets you feeling nice for 30 minutes then your body is insisting it needs more. it gets out of hand a lot quicker imo and i’m really starting to come to terms with that myself. i love it when it’s good. i feel like coke is a more subtle high as well (i’m also someone who can easily get carried away with stims bc of mental health issues, i enjoy being more active and wanting to socialize as the only time i’ve ever experienced that is during manic episodes which i’m actively being treated for) and it’s just not worth it for how much damage it can cause. i have been binging for a little bit now (nothing crazy just way more than i’ve ever done even though i’ve used coke long before this) and i need to stop. i think with ketamine (unless ur railing fat lines and trying to k-hole) you take a few bumps and you feel calm but also happy. you can function fine but it’s not tweaking you out like coke because you don’t really need that much to feel nice and you don’t have to redose as insanely often as you have to on coke. but this also depends on if you drink and stuff too and if you’re on other medications etc. i take 300mg seroquel & 75mg effexor bid and i never drink. alcohol is poison to my body it just doesn’t react well at all."

Drugs,fd42tle,t3_ek0lfs,1578163847.0,"idk but the comedown sounds kinda like you snorted molly... but molly is also pretty different to snort compared to coke (harsher to snort, smells like black liquorice kinda). but maybe if you were drunk you didn’t notice the difference? when you snort molly too it affects you differently than ingesting it (hits faster, lasts less than the normal 4-6hr range). or maybe the shit was just potent coke hahaha"
