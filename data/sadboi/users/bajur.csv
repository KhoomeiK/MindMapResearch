And if for some reason I don‚Äôt feel like running the dungeon, I can just buy the set from another player because a game economy exists. Where as with destiny it can take months, if not longer to get the gun/armour with the roll your looking for. It‚Äôs an artificial grind that was barely rewarding as it was. 

And this is without going into the massive skill and passive ability trees you can unlock and rank up, essentially making your character and play style exactly how you want it. 

Destiny has the grind of an mmo but not the pay off nor the sheer amount of content and loot. (Tho it claims to have all that and more) 

It took me three seasons to build 3 sets of armour in destiny. 1 for raids, 1 for crucible and 1 general set. I switch out pieces as I come across new ones with better stats. I have zero interest to do that intense grind once again to make even one set relevant to my play style. This isn‚Äôt even touching on the subject of my favorite weapon, subtle calamity, that took me over a year to get the roll I wanted. (And pinnacle weapons... I‚Äôll stay off that soapbox) 

I get sun setting. But maybe leave our armour and pinnacle weapons out of it. And if armour HAS to be sunsetted than maybe a better system overall. Let us pick where the armour stats go. We earn points by doing something and we can plunk those points into that armour piece up to a maximum for each stat. Mods take us the rest of the way. And a much better masterwork economy would be amazing too. I play destiny a lot, but I barely managed to get two characters into master worked armour for 1 set each.

And when I say big content drop I mean somewhere between forsaken and shadowkeep amount. Forsaken taxed bungie a lot as it was a brand new game level of content in a relatively short span of time to create. 

Would be cool to have resolutions to stories that have been hanging for years in a reasonable amount of time. The uldren story had been on hold for a year and a half with only a small cut scene and lore entry to keep it going. 

No idea of anything like this is even possible with the current scope of the game, but it would be cool to see.

Edit to add: I‚Äôm not even sure what my battlepass bought this season. I could have just gone with the free content and had basically the same amount of stuff to do."
DestinyTheGame,fmcbtxl,t1_fmc47er,1585942685.0,"Yes and no. At least with vex offensive you have multiple chances for loot and since it was match made you typically had a group to run it with. So all in all you had reasons to do it. And there was the mission prompts in the right hand corner to help new players figure out what was required. 

Seraph tower you have the one chance at loot and it‚Äôs very sub par and not worth the amount of effort required, getting a full lobby or even one with more than 1-2 people, let alone that want to do the event is a pain and there are no prompts to help new players so you fail more times than succeed. I can‚Äôt even begin to guess the amount of times other players keep defending a plate that isn‚Äôt active while ignoring the currently active and now overrun plate or the ones who are throwing the orbs at adds instead of at the red glowing floating orb thing (what should I even be calling that thing?!)

But all in all, all these event wore out their shine pretty quick. Some just took less time."
DestinyTheGame,fmcb4ga,t1_fmc4o27,1585942303.0,"Tbh I still play reckoning, I‚Äôm weird like that. 
Sundial was a chore, I really really dislike the champions so it wasent even fun for a couple play throughs (until the wishender bug, that month was a blast). Nothing like having to get up close and personal with anti barrier rounds because lord only knows why the rounds are only available on close range weapons and being one shotted. 

But yeah, replay ability is low on all these activities. If they could revamp some of the old match made stuff with new enemies or some new mechanics and have new/better rewards, it would help breath life into a lot of the old activities that stick around."
DestinyTheGame,fmc33mq,t1_fmbz841,1585937998.0,"At least the vex offensive was fun for a bit. There is less to do this ‚Äòseason‚Äô than any of these other half assed seasons. 

We have escalation protocol light that is a repetitive activity until you get to a joke of a  ‚Äòboss phase‚Äô and that‚Äôs if your lucky enough to load into an instance where there other players who want to do the activity. 

There is trails, which is currently a dumpster fire of problems. Highly doubt it‚Äôs been in the works for 2 years and if it was, might want to see what the team was actually doing in that time. 

We have the repetitive grind of years old content to get bits to upgrade the obelisks, I mean bunkers. 
 
And the core content of this season: bounties. Bounties for bits, bright dust and vendor tokens (which is the same vendor content we have had for years) 

I‚Äôve played 2867 hours of this game and up until shadowkeep I‚Äôve been having a blast. Took breaks when I burned out but always came back.

Hard to practice when your continually getting stomped and getting so frustrated you quit for good. 

As people below mentioned trials of the nine had a pretty good loot system. You get something for wins, which motivates players to keep going. When players get the exact same stuff for winning as they do loosing, aka nothing, they have very little reason to keep playing. Can‚Äôt call the game a looter shooter if there is no loot."

Raids are the top tier activity for PvE. I get rewards for each section cleared.

The reason I willing to bet this is: people are gullible and stupid. Saw an article today saying cineplex is closing during the outbreak. People were pointing out in the comments that they won‚Äôt be compensating their employees during this period. An employee argued against this saying that cineplex was. A commenter asked how much, EI covering 55% and cineplex covering the rest? The employee responded with just EI. 

This is not cineplex covering the wages. Cineplex effectively temporarily laid off their workforce, but some people are attributing the EI they get from the government to cineplex paying them.

Childless = wants children but cannot currently or ever due to various reasons. 

Childfree = does not want children, even if they have the means to do so. 

It‚Äôs a small but very important distinction and getting it wrong can be very painful to people depending on why they fall into either category.

That and the horrible lag when playing couch coop. Turned my husband and I right off the game. Which sucks as we sunk a vast amount of time into BL2 and we‚Äôre excited to do the same with BL3.

We used to have a full roster. Last season players just stopped logging on. Went from having a page to 2 pages of active players at the start of a season to a whole 10 that we had for this seasons reset.

To make it easier on them finically and in general we all agreed that it was cool that the babies came.

Now my cousin was an asshole and brought his 2 older kids (aged 7-9) even with the invite explaining the event was child free  these two kids were/are raised by their nannies. Meaning my cousin and his wife have zero control over the kids. 

We couldn‚Äôt even tell the two babies were there but the two older kids and a friends drunk boyfriend who became an ex midway through the night and proceeded to try to start a fight were very noticeable.

One should never arm chair a diagnosis based on stigma. Stigma is generalized and typically only entails the worst information about something.
