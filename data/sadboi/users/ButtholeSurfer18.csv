Showerthoughts,exhuak2,t1_exhs9us,1566314285.0,"1) I say Yes 100% anarchy for all, then hopefully the human race will wipe itself out from all the chaos.

2) Ideas aren't real, if I believe in magic unicorns that doesn't mean they are real in the physical realm. Morality is just what people deem right or wrong and puts people in boxes. It's often contradicted in desperate situations, survival, religion, laws, history and etc. If something can not be scientificly proven it's just a concept that doesn't exist in the physical world therefore fake. Psychopaths have no sense of morality, the same can be said about the first homo sapiens.

3) So according to your communism example, something is made into a set of rules therefore it's real? It's not, DIVORCE YOURSELF from the false idea that bc an idea becomes into a set of principals used by people that it becomes real. It doesn't, if it was it would exist without human arbitrary feelings. 

4) The wisdom part of the qoute is referring to his immoral acton's, calling him a monster for what he did. Again, morality is subjective therefore it doesn't make it true. You may argue he was a monster others may say he wasn't justifying it some other way. Wisdom: the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgment; the quality of being wise.

Of course we will never experience death without actually dying but we can make an educated guess with the knowledge and scientific research we've collected this far. 
   Autopsy's are conducted to learn how someone died which is why we have people that devote years of their lives to become medical examiners and forensic pathologists.
