But after that the rate of cell growth drops and the rate of cell death increases, causing us to be considered dying instead. 

So basically, I agreed with what you were saying. But was clarifying instead of using the word everyone since anyone below 25 wouldn't be considered dying from an existential level. That's literally allllll I was trying to say. I'm sorry I upset you, but that wasn't my intention and only meant to add to the topic. If it bothers you though. I don't have a problem deleting it."
