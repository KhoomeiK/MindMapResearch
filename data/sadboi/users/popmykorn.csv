If I had a chance to do it all over again, I would without thinking at all. And, not because I feel I could have made some better decisions, but just so that i can relive the happiness that once my mother said she could see on my face. The pain and the sadness would come anyway because I am naive. And to think it is a curse, would be a shame because I once expected a son, who would have looked like me. I wake up and look at myself in the mirror everyday, disgusted. My words are nothing, my body is scarred, and my soul is degraded. Where am I lost? No way to understand, how this is the way I am."

She wrote a 5 page letter about me and what I make her feel like before she said she needs to pursue her career and go back to Germany but we are together always. Last week i messaged her that I am lost and I am reading her letter and I missed her being around. She says, and I quote ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help you‚Äù. I don‚Äôt I will ever be the same again.

Language is not a barrier if you can speak Russian, but it is not a problem if you don‚Äôt. There are many English speaking people. And everyone is so nice. I can speak basic Kartuli[Georgian language] and i did not take a course or anything and i am all self taught.

On the other hand, the future of EU lies with Ukraine and Georgia mainly because of the strategic location of these countries, i am sure you can check that online as well. The more you read, the better.

I was able to buy my farm here and i am homesteading in 5 acres with my own produce and livestock, there is a river flowing out the back that reaches all the way to the Black Sea, and there are mountains all around. I spend time nicely here, and life is so much better. I can share some pictures as well if you would like to see around!"

And hopefully what I say can help you decide about your future plan."
Sakartvelo,fcycxju,t3_ejejn1,1578078247.0,You should search for groups on Facebook where they hold language learning sessions across Tbilisi. A lot of Georgians are keen to learn other languages as well just as much people like us are keen to learn Georgian [kartuli]. I learnt a lot by using a translator and brainstorming myself in a meaningful conversation with someone who had patience. I recommend learning Russian before learning Kartuli as many people in Georgia know Russian. So it will be comparatively easier to transition and it will add one more language to your name.
