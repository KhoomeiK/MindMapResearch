Jk sorry I‚Äôm poor."
AmItheAsshole,euzfbqe,t1_euzddm2,1564118547.0,Oh right. Makes sense then if they‚Äôre a small family.
AmItheAsshole,euzc82j,t1_euz3gwe,1564116962.0,"The one on one birthday dinner with the stepdad is pretty weird too. Usually birthday dinners involve a group of family members and friends. If it‚Äôs one on one, it‚Äôs usually with a significant other not just your stepdaughter. Where was her mom in all this?"
AmItheAsshole,euzbplg,t1_euysz5f,1564116699.0,"I know right? The way she describes her stepdad being ‚Äúinto it‚Äù is creepy af.

I personally wouldn‚Äôt wear this out but I think this could be reasonably worn to a nightclub. Not with family wtf"

AmItheAsshole,euz92o8,t1_euxcucp,1564115377.0,"That makes a little more sense. Usually comparing people to cows is considering insulting bc the connotation is that they‚Äôre fat, slow, and stupid but if you have a personal connection to cows then that‚Äôs kinda different. Still 

you‚Äôre NTA but either this is a shitpost or you‚Äôre weirdly sheltered. Where did you grow up and where do you live now? Did you go to college?"

I know there was a trigger initially. I have an Nmom who insists on having access to my Facebook and email for example and have my phone sync up with the family iPad so she sees all my communications and photographs. It‚Äôs a long story there. 

I have had her randomly call me to scream and cry over something I said to a friend or a selfie I took in an outfit that offends her. 

It‚Äôs like the feeling of terror and guilt except that feeling often just randomly strikes now without any communication from her"

raisedbynarcissists,etbjnib,t3_cao785,1562649122.0,Exact same. She‚Äôd even call me pathetic for being insecure and I had to laugh at that irony

AmItheAsshole,et8lmyj,t1_et84ies,1562560410.0,That‚Äôs fair enough. I guess personally I would prefer that in a more secluded corner of said beach or my own backyard bc I am someone who would be distracted by others‚Äô nudity

I feel like mine is ‚Äúquiet‚Äù or atypical but everyday is a battle against my own thoughts and trying not to self harm. I am struggling thru grad school and have 2 more years. I finally made time for therapy after like months of neglect and just focusing on law school to the detriment of my health. I try not to compare myself to others but I feel bad knowing I don‚Äôt work as hard on school as most of my peers and my grades show it bc we‚Äôre on a curve.

I have the same problem as ur gf just not as severe. My last bf indulged it on occasion w clear boundaries.

AmItheAsshole,ergdf32,t1_erga7u1,1560834714.0,I‚Äôm a woman. I wear thick enough dresses that allow me to wear normal underwear without anything showing through. It‚Äôs not hard.
