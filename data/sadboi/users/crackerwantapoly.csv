I noticed that when I would masturbate I'd get short with my wife. One time she even asked me why I was so snappy towards her.

Suicidal thoughts - like it suggests, thoughts about taking your life.

Suicidal plans - actually making plans to end your life.

Wanting to die - wishing you were dead, wishing you hadn't been born, but not to the point of thinking about taking your life or making plans to do so.

A friend of mine told me that his son had expressed suicidal tendencies. I asked him which of the 3 his son was experiencing. He did not know the difference. I explained it to him. He was quite intrigued. Thing is his son was in a partial hospitalization program and is now in an out patient program with the same place. The therapist has never asked the questions. Say what? That's a bad therapist that supposedly specializes in teenagers if she's never delved in deeper.

My BIL took his life almost 4 years ago. It was devastating. He was on my cell phone plan. He smashed his phone before taking his life. So I put a SIM card in a spare phone and the text messages people sent after his death were so heart wrenching. My son texted him, ""Hey [uncle's name]. How's heaven? RIP."" I cried so hard when I saw that text. It took me at least 8 months to tell my wife. Suicide hurts, a lot, really bad.

It takes courage to be vulnerable. And being vulnerable is how we make meaningful connections with others.

SuicideWatch,ffzzqmh,t1_ffzca48,1580396960.0,"Motivation can be difficult to find. Especially when life goes sideways. My parents were married and divorced a total of 7 times. I wanted to get married once and stay married. Then my wife essentially cheated on me and I noped the fuck out of that shit and got divorced. I had wrapped my entire identity in being a husband. This past November was the one year anniversary of my wife rejecting me. I got so depressed. Took me two months to get out of the funk. 

The problem was that I had wrapped up my entire identity in something that could be taken away. I was so focused on being a husband that when I lost that title I lost my purpose. Look for purpose in something that cannot be taken from you. Education is something that you will never lose. And there's endless possibilities to learn about. I use Excel and spreadsheets all the time. I learned how to write macros (like programming). I love to learn and I love to help out others with my knowledge. This gives me purpose that cannot be taken away and I can use to help others.

It's good to have ideas of what you want to do for a living when you're an adult. I wanted to be an SR-71 pilot when I was a kid. Then I got glasses in the 7th grade so there went that dream. Then I wanted to be a mechanical engineer and design sports cars. But I failed calculus so there went that dream. So I eventually got a degree in accounting. My GPA was so bad that I had a hard time finding a job when I graduated college. I wound up becoming an auditor which eventually turned into the perfect job for me. I love my job. And it's nowhere near being a pilot of a secret spy plane. Oh I'd switch jobs to be a spy plane pilot in a heartbeat. My point being that we don't have to have life all figured out really ever. 

So take life one day at a time. That's how it comes anyway. Find something to give you purpose today. Maybe it's study for an exam. Maybe it's take a shower. Make it anything you want. Talk with someone new. 

Focus on something positive. Find something good in your life. Anything. Then look for the next thing. Keep searching. Google what to be positive about if you need ideas.

It wasn't needless to say because that gives us something to talk about. It's good that you recognize that you self-sabotage. Why do you self-sabotage? When do you self-sabotage?

You are correct that you cannot protect the world from him. You don't have proof that he did anything criminal. He may have said he looked at cp just to see your reaction.

Definitely unfriend him, block him, and forget about him. Change your number even. No matter what happens it will never be your fault. He is in charge himself. He's responsible for himself. You can't control him.

Our smart phones are making us dumber and causing so much anxiety. People are too busy comparing everyone else's outsides to their insides. We are literally driving ourselves crazy with social media and such. Put down your phone and go for a walk. Do something. Anything. Read a book, watch a movie. Talk with a therapist.

I'd venture to say that you feel like you don't have any friends because you identify how your dad treats you. So you send out the same feelings he shows towards you because you see yourself in the same way. 

I know what you are going through. My dad caused me lots of pain. I too thought about running away or suicide. Now he's dead and my life is going well. My point being that some day he'll be gone either through you cutting off contact with him or he'll be gone.

Hundreds of years will be spent on the ""if I had only known"" situations. They all care deeply about you. More than you will ever know. 

Let's flip the ""make them regret losing you"" message. Who is causing you the pain? Cut off contact with them. You don't need them in your life. If you can't right now, make a plan on how you're going to do it. Make whoever is hurting you regret losing you by getting yourself out of their pathetic miserable existence.

Pero no podemos convencerte de eso. Es tan triste que tus padres te echan la culpa todavía. Ellos todavía no han procesado su dolor y nunca van a mejorar mientras te echan la culpa así. 13 años es mucho tiempo para llevar algo tan pesado para ti y para ellos. Quizás nunca van a cambiar. No puedes controlarles.

No sé qué estás pensando. Me imagino que piensas que si tuvieras más cuidado quizás no hicieras que la estatua se caía en tu hermana. Tienes que dejar de pensar en todos los posibilidades que no pasaron. No puedes controlar el pasado. Solamente podemos controlar el presente y la mañana. Mi terapeuta me dijo que tengo que enfocarme en lo que yo puedo controlar. Me tomó un año para poder hacer eso.

Escucha. Solamente tenías 5 años de edad cuando eso pasó. No fue tu culpa. Cosas pasan. Cosas buenas, cosas malas, cosas tristes. Eso fue algo triste. Te sientes culpable. Tienes que perdonarte porque fue un accidente y nada más. 

Quizás sería mejor para escribir una carta para tus padres.  Que extrañas a tu hermana muchísima. Que amas a tu hermana muchísima. Que te sientes triste por lo que pasó. Puedes decirles que fue un accidente y nada más. Puedes rogar por su perdón. Que quieres ser una a familia feliz y vivir en el presente. Que no quieres olvidarla. Quizás pueden empezar una tradición para recordarla.

Espero que tu famila pueda sanar de la tristeza. Las tristes de ayer están robando la felicidad de mañana. Abrazos mi amiga. Manténte fuerte.

exmormon,fcxgoh3,t3_ej9df8,1578062458.0,"My (now ex) wife one time found a bunch of pictures of Victoria Secret models that I had downloaded. Oh man, off to the bishop she sent me to repent. The bishop wasn't overly concerned about it. More about the masturbation than the pictures. He kind of laughed when I told him about the pictures. 

Then a couple of years later she caught me looking at actual porn. Different bishop this time. I repented and promised to never look at porn again.

The problem was I had a lot higher libido than she did. Way higher. So I started looking at porn again but got better at hiding it. We left the cult and I think her views changed. We were on vacation and she says to me, ""Want to watch porn together?"" SAY WHAT?!?!?! Oh hell yeah baby! So we watched a porno and I'll leave out the details. But she wasn't offended anymore. She'd catch me watching porn and doing my thing and join me.

I guess she finally figured out that I wasn't replacing her with porn. It was my outlet. She'd offer to watch porn with me sometimes. I only like softcore stuff. No abuse or shit like that. Watching porn with her was a crazy turn on."

You can pretty much say anything to anyone, call them names, tell them to fuck themselves. Freedom of speech. But freedom of speech does not protect threats of physical violence.

He gently moved her to the side. He went to jail even though the girlfriend said he didn't hurt her.

However, if the dad has punched a wall that's a different story. That is called intimidation by proxy and is practically assault. You can go to jail for that. I learned a lot from my two months of anger management group therapy.
