Then bone-thin women are idealized in other societies. White people are glorified in certain societies, etc. attraction is becoming more varied because culture in society is becoming more varied. Everyone isn’t following a mainstream culture because the cultural gatekeepers are no longer there (media fragmentation, for example).

If anything, I think that there are more universal traits that everyone can agree on that are ugly or unattractive. But when it comes to what’s attractive? Much more variety. There is a difference between the two."

She had tried to break it off several times because she was constantly unsure of herself. Needed to be alone. Struggled with mental illnesses and was exhausted in hiding it from me. Not knowing that that what was attracted me to her even more. In retrospect, as amazing as a character as she was, it wouldn’t have worked out for us long term for many, many reasons. I mainly just miss the warmth she provided. And the sex. Just the two of us in her apartment. I’m more scared of being lonely again. I’m talking to other girls right now. But it’s not the same as it was with her for some reason."

What kind of men are women attracted to when their hormones change on a contraceptive?"

antiwork,fdziws7,t3_en92ek,1578790616.0,"I have a serious question. Why does it feel like people had more time to do shit back then (1980s, 1990s) than we do today? Like cooking, spending time with family, personal hobbies, dating, leisure, vacation, etc.?

Now most people just rot away in front of screens after work..."
