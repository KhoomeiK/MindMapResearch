One way to cope is to direct your attention toward all the resources at your disposal which ARE under your control which you can use to solve problems.

Physical resources (you are under control of your physical body):

Grounding techniques— breath deeply and focus on your breath, focus on your sense of touch, then focus on objects around and name them (your boss’s red button down shirt, green fern, white water cooler.)

Emotional:

Name the emotion you’re feeling and process it instead of acting it out. You’re likely feeling shame over making mistakes. Making a mistake doesn’t make you a mistake. Even if you made the mistake because you are in fact fundamentally flawed in some way, so is everyone else in some other way. A fundamentally flaw doesn’t make YOU a flaw. Psychological problems are solvable. They aren’t catastrophes. The bottom line: You aren’t defined by your flaws or mistakes— even if they are persistent, they are fixable. Most of you is good anyway. 

Cognitive:
Direct your conscious mind’s attention to the task at hand. You have trillions of neurons. Make plans. Think ahead. Adapt."

Confidence comes from preparedness. Preparedness comes from competence. Competence is earned through consistent practice. So, you have to earn your confidence. You can't just ""not give a fuck.""

Repeating to yourself ""I don't give a fuck"" releases adrenaline and prepares you for a fight (the fight or flight response.) So, it hypes you up for a few minutes in preparation for a fight. It's a short-term solution. It's not authentic confidence. It's more like fleeting courage.

No one is on the side of the person who won't respect social mores. Trying to destroy the neural pathways responsible for ""giving a fuck"" until you literally ""can't give a fuck"" leads to mental health issues. You also deteriorate the mental health of the people around you in your community. That's why your community won't be on your side and will probably stay away from you.
