I feel exactly the same when on my hell week, I feel very sensitive to rejection (and most of the time the said rejection is only on my mind), I become too self-conscious, my anxiety rises. It helped my partner a lot to understand how I feel about it and learn how to reassure me. Maybe you can both track your symptoms every month to see the trends and be able to objectively identify which phase you and your partner are on at the moment..."
