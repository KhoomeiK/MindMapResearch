aromanticasexual,fop5szd,t1_fop1752,1587953717.0,It's just how I am. I don't know how to explain it.
aromanticasexual,fooqx5w,t1_fooqdr7,1587944568.0,"Oh no, I don't hate others who are different, everyone is different no? If I can word that better it's mostly I'm dissapointed in myself for failing them. I really felt like I let them down, leading them on a path to nothing in the end. I hate myself or, to put it lightly dislike this side of me. I want to feel love if that's a good way of putting it? I feel like I can't. And that's what I hate? It's hard to explain?? I'm sorry! I should seriously get a real life therapist because it's probably a bit overwhelming to understand some blabbering online."
aromanticasexual,fooqhd8,t1_foopw7o,1587944306.0,"Thank you. I've for a while now considered getting one but I find it hard to convince myself to physically ask for one to my mom. I worry about so many different scenarios coming out of it that I simply don't expect anyone online to understand. Venting online to people you don't know is just so easy compared to having to do it in person.. it's odd how we work as people I suppose. I wish you luck out there, ok?"
aromanticasexual,foooxay,t1_fooopp3,1587943379.0,"Oh. Wow thank you I didn't expect a reply that fast. I think they cared about who I was, as they did research on it but I think after a while it became overwhelming for them and their emotions. Thank you man. I hope you have a good long life, ok? I'll keep trying."
