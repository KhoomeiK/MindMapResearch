Anxiety,fiuvgsm,t3_f97q02,1582749005.0,"Oh, jeah, thinking about something I did when I was 5 years old, thinking about things I did 5 years ago, thinking for example about the time I was at the supermarket buying pastries for breakfast, and you have to put a barcode sticker to the bag of the pastrie, and I realised at the self checkout that I forgot the sticker, so I had to ask the shop assistant what to do, and she maintained my place as I ran to get the sticker, and this happened not once, but twice, and I was so embarassed, now I’m extra careful about this"

depression,f6jzhda,t3_drkz4k,1572902571.0,"I feel this so much. I constantly think in situation that it would be so much easier if someone would just stab me. There was a time where I was watching a tv series about superheroes, and at the end of the season they were dealing with some really difficult situation, and I was just like, why wouldn’t they just try to kill themselves, it would be easier. 
Despite all of this, I thought about it, and I would never actually try to kill myself, because in my current state I always can say to myself, that I don’t have to think about this, everything is fine.

So here I am wishing that my mental health would got worse and would reach a point where I would no longer think this through, and also wishing that my mental health would get better so I just could live my life."
