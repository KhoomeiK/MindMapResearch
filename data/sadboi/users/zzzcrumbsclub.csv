TalkTherapy,fqrojux,t3_gk23xr,1589588581.0,"You are worth about as much as what others consider you're worth

Kindness often hides truth, be real to yourself

Your emotions are gateways to thought

We are all fundamentally flawed

Everyone deserves only what they get

A bad day, week or month is ok as far as you feel it is ok

Time moves only forward

You must nurture and protect yourself, else life will humble you

Relinquishing control to survival mechanism is nothing to be calm about

See point 5

Innocence does not chase pain away

You are emotionally programmed

Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to conformity

See point 1

You are allowed in public spaces or your privately owned property

You were forced to exist

Struggle asks no permission

See point 3

You are the collective of your experiences

???

patience is a skill, love isn't easy

This motherfucker is a clairvoyant

some people are alone in the crowd, some people survived when they died

&#x200B;

peace"
