That’s a pretty massive jump to “Sweden stopped using it today.” I could point out your source is known to be pretty negatively biased towards Trump, again, I’m no fan, but as I said, little to no side effects and SOME people are legitimately downplaying the effectiveness because of their dislike for the man, that’s a fact. Your source says one person had some temporary side effects, and gave zero statistics on its claim that the drug works for some and not for others...while myself and others have linked numerous studies from doctors all over the world with near 100% success rate in all their trials (I’ll let you track those down just sort by new and start reading). This will be the last time I engage in discussion with you. All drugs have some side effects, whether it be in dosage, length of time prescribed or combining with other medication. No one is refuting that, however there is clear evidence this does work, that is based on...science! No one is refuting the science either.
