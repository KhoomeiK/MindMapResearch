Look, just treat her like you found her watching porn or something because the most embarresing thing that can happen to me when i was 10, was my parents reading the stuff i wrote to people at MSP. Don't tell your parents but make fun of her in not a rude way ofc but say you don't want her to be mean and if she keeps this up you're gonna show that to your parents."
confession,eojdmwv,t3_bs295f,1558636462.0,"Even if how bad you treated him i'm sure he loved you and wouldn't want you to get sad like this. I lost my grandma' years ago but i still have nightmares about how badly i treated the poor woman, i was a hot headed young bratt that would thretan her to tell my parents that she stealed stuff from us just because i was mad or shout at her 'you're gonna die soon anyways so shut up' and these things are horrible even to thinking back now.
I did apogolise many times to her and she always accepted it like she wasn't crying a minute ago, she was wise and humble from the fact she aged to mature and she thought my behaviour was because of how young i was. Just because she accepted my apogolises all the time i didn't think much of it. 
All the stuff i put her trough started to come at me so suddenly after she died and what's even worse was the feeling of regret, but there is no where to go other than praying to God and hoping she was so so happy in heaven. This type of sadness is unbearable but i didn't pray to get better i prayed that i would got even sadder and all the things i've done to her would happen to me ten times worse, i thought i would do anything she would tell me to do if she was alive for a minute but when i opened up about these feelings to my sister. She said ""grandma wouldn't want you to do these things to yourself, because she's not you, she always loved you and would never want you to torture yourself from heaven looking at you, she always wished good for people and she wouldn't be mad about such things you did to her because she knew you. So if you wanna do something for her, get better for her. She would want that."". 

I know it's not some hell of a advice but it worked for me thinking back how i stopped having nightmares. The loved one you lost would never want to see you upset or in a dark place. So get better, not for yourself but for the sake of that person. They would want you to be happy trust me!"
