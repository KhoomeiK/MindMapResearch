So it is at least partly an apples to apples comparison. Given that Communism is now a flexible ideology? I mean, anarcho-communism exists. Democratic-Communism can theoretically exist. Command economy and authoritarian government are separate ideas, that happen to converge in communist countries. 

So what is the bill coming forward to do? Because at the moment, it's bringing forward an idea to a topic no one is having in seriousness. It sounds to me like trying to ascribe a tone of defiance to any economic model that is in any way related to communism, so that we can vilify those people who support those ideas."
