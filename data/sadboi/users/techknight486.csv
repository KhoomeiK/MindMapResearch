As far as your rating comment, that's a lie. Google Star Trek Picard ratings and you'll see several articles claiming strong ratings for the series. I do see some reports of drops but that's common for any television show. And as far as reviews it looks to be average. Pretty fair for a series that just started. 

CBS wouldn't be going all in on Star Trek if the ratings weren't there. That's the indicator. Not people that come in here and parrot the nitpicky opinions from YouTube reviewers whose job it is to nitpick things for money.

Plus I thought I was responding to OP of the statement I responded , but I just noticed you're an entirely different person so that changes my perspective on who I'm talking to a bit, so I've adjusted because it seems you're open to actually having a conversation which I appreciate. 

You make a fair statement, though I don't totally agree. The scene where Raffi is using her connection with an old colleague and essentially had to blackmail her I thought was a good example of character development for instance. The defeated look on her face when she hung up and then how insensitive Picard by clapping at her for burning a bridge was there I think spoke volumes about their current relationship. You can also imply that she's had a troubling relationship with Starfleet since she got sacked immediately after Picard resigned. She was likely an Ensign Ro type character Picard took under his wing and he essentially abandoned her leaving her to be a bitter person. So when I see someone say things like ""they had as much character development as a CW show"" I find that to be incredibly disingenuous, when it does exist and well. 

I thought the episode where Jurati is trying to figure things out about Rios through his holograms was another great bit of character development and one of the best scenes in the series. Before that episode I didn't care too much about Rios but once we saw it pieced together the way it was I think it created a good foundation to build upon. 

Another example, and I think this scene presented was kind of the thesis, is when Jurati was gushing to Soji about her being an android and she basically shut her down and said ""am I a person to you"" gave a huge amount of development not only for her character but any other synthetic character we see going forward. She does come off as a bit of a blank slate, but that's because she is! She doesn't know herself yet so it wouldn't be fair to expect the audience to. We'll likely see this touched upon in more detail especially now that Picard himself is in this class of people. 

I can agree it should be developed more in the following seasons, which is my point. This season he got the team together, next season we'll (hopefully) get to see them acting more as a team. I think alot of what people are perceiving as flaws is something that will fade away as there's more of this show out there. In fact I think releasing it on a TV schedule was a bit of a mistake personally as I found it more enjoyable on my second watch with the context of the entire season. 

I'm still not sure it's fair to compare it to Game of Thrones, who had tons of material to draw on before the TV writers even sat down, but Breaking Bad is an example I can see being fair since that was an IP that was developed from scratch. It's also fair to point out it also perhaps failed in some aspects there. Many people think Skylar for example is a bit of a cold hearted bitch, despite the fact that she was right the entire time about Walt. We weren't really given any reason to emphasize with her in their first season, so we ended up identifying more with the man committing literal crimes and not seeing her as a victim. 

Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever made, but even that example has characters that got more development as a the seasons went on, something I think people need to give Picard more of a chance to do. I think Breaking Bad season 1 is better than Picard season 1, but I've never claimed the show is perfect, but enjoyable and fun certainly and I think that's a point that alot of people are missing when they come into these subs and just harass actual fans of the show.

I gave you examples of character development, things I thought of from the top of my head when I was bored at work, and you say those don't count because you apparently have an axe to grind. Just because you didn't care to pay attention doesn't make it true. I was able to connect with most of the characters just fine. The only character that I think this is true about is Narek. He was absolutely handled hamfistedly so I'll give you points there, I guess. 

Also GoT had the benefit of an entire book series that already established those characters. It's better sure, but they didn't start those characters from scratch. Even then from a Television perspective we didn't know shit about many of those characters until later seasons. You gonna tell me Jon Snow was fleshed out right away? How about Sansa?

Star Trek throws out canon for plot all the time. It's a valid criticism, but a petty one given history. I never claimed the show is perfect, but I found it to be very well done overall.

You're keen on nitpicking every time they violate it (in your perception, many people's hot takes on this are flat out wrong or exaggerated) but seems you're overlooking all the times they do great things with the canon. And there are plenty. I've seen all the shows enough times to pick up on the little things, which PIC respects in abundance. A franchise spanning 50 years with dozens of creative teams is going to slip up once in awhile, and even then it's easy to think of ways around it: temporal anomaly, unreliable narrator, straight up wrong narrator. The most egregious example is the Romulan computer thing.  I raised my eyebrow on that too, but it was an interesting idea and using your imagination you can come up with ways to explain it. 

>The conclusion of the story and emotional impact it's supposed to have >being entirely reliant on a totally different television show, story and >relationship that's external to this show is terrible, terrible writing.

None of this is an example of poor writing. Many pieces of media have relied on the foundations of other things it their franchises to continue a story. By your definition The Empire Strikes Back or Back To The Future II would be considered awful storytelling. Who's this Thomas Riker guy in DS9?  What an awful show!  It's a continuation of Picard's story, using themes from his past to tell this present story. If someone decides to start watching without the context of the previous series that's on them. Your example is terrible analysis and you're grasping for straws to justify not liking this show. 

Throughout the show they established who Data was, why he was important to Picard, how he died, and his impact on the universe. Someone who hasn't watched Nemesis may have less of an emotional impact then someone who has, but it's unreasonable to assume people aren't going to put it together at the conclusion of this series. Sorry but you're flat out wrong on it depending entirely on previous media. Plus I know a few people that watched the this show without watching any other Trek and liked the series.

Your paragraph just proves my point?  Use your imagination. Your lack of imagination is not bad writing. What we were shown was not explicitly shown to be the entirety of the simulation. You don't know the extent of the simulation and your argument here is in bad faith. 

>We know Data was incapable of ending his own life in his current >circumstances and was required to request Picard to do so. Considering >that makes him tantamount to a prisoner without any mechanism of >escape positing what Data may or may not have wanted seems asinine. 

It's reasonable to assume that he couldn't have ended his life himself yes, it is unreasonable to assume he couldn't have requested someone else to do so and decided to ask Picard to at that moment. 

Or maybe you're right that it was a bad design for Data. But that doesn't make it bad writing. I work in IT, professionals design terrible things all the time. 

>Data's given reasoning behind the decision is nonsensical. It's >philosophically vacuous.

To you maybe.  This is not a valid criticism. This was a choice this character wanted to make. His motivations are not up to you to decide if it is right or wrong. This was his point of view, not Picard's, not mine, not yours. You can disagree with his viewpoint, but that doesn't make it wrong or bad writing. 

>If he lived ten-trillion years his life would still be finite. Data was never a >human however he always strove to be as close to one as possible and >he now actually had the possibility to become one in virtually every >possible way. He could have lived as an actual human, with an actual >humans lifespan or had a longer/shorter one of his own design.

Data literally was offered to become human by Q and refused him. The Borg Queen offered him flesh and blood and he decided to pass on that. This reasoning is flawed. It may not be how you would write it, I would have also liked to see that personally, but what you want and not getting is not bad writing. Again you proved my point, maybe he lived ten-trillion years and now he's bored. Picard showing up seemed like as good of time as any to end it. Seems like a nice end to his story to him maybe?  You don't know his motivations and neither do I. Speculating on it is part of the fun. Voyager explored this theme with Q and Q and it's a valid philosophical theme. 

Just a short list of things that ""don't make sense"" in Star Trek if you give it a puddles worth of analysis. 

In Star Trek IV what was the whale probe doing there?  How does it know the whales?  What was it's message?  It must be bad writing we never find out. 

In Star Trek VI we see a Klingon Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. Yes it was the prototype, but did they destroy all the plans? Did someone else not think to try again?  Must be an awful movie not worth watching. 

Why are the Borg so interested in humanity?  Doesn't it seem a bit odd they keep sending one ship across the Galaxy to assimilate Earth?  Best of Both Worlds must be the worst TNG episode of all time. The Borg's motivations make no sense. 

Why do the Cardassians leave a (mostly) functioning space station in orbit around Bajor when they leave?  Why didn't they just blow the whole thing up?  Sure they destroyed some equipment but it seems like an odd choice to just leave it there for the Bajorans to use. Deep Space Nine must be an awful series with terrible writing. 

Why does almost every space battle we see depicted act like space isn't infinite in all directions?  Why do they act like submarines when they can literally just flee in any direction. Balance of Terror must be the worst TOS episode ever!"

Picard,fp3lzdp,t1_fnx3xjs,1588281659.0,"But just because you don't have the answers to these questions doesn't make it bad writing.

Sure he's been in there for 10-14 years, but do we know how he perceives time? It's a complex simulation, so perhaps he experienced everything he wanted to experience and decided that was it. Maybe Data didn't want a new body? Maybe he wanted to experience the afterlife in a more human way and decided that seeing Picard again was his way of calling it and ending his life. 

I don't think Data's wishes to end his life conflict with Picard's. Picard said he was 10 to 20 years. Not everyone views the world in the same way. Maybe someone else in the same situation would have wanted the golem to be immortal and think Data's viewpoint is a bunch of bollocks. 

Part of the fun I've always had with Star Trek is using my imagination to fill things in. Expecting the writers to spoonfeed you the answers to all these questions would be an example of bad writing, not the other way around."

I say this as someone that would be very tempted to do what you did however, if you know the actual value of something like that you really should disclose it in a private sale like you're describing, especially since it was an inheritance like that.

scifi,flz66cf,t1_flyy7th,1585616391.0,"Disagree. I thought every episode ranged from very good to excellent. Maybe if I laid out exactly why I liked it better. 

I also didn't really answer the dislike part, so here I'll get that out of the way. I certainly didn't think it was perfect. Anybody that says anything is perfect is wrong or being hyperbolic. Some of this is boils down to choices I may not have made personally but I accept the writers did for whatever reason. 

Didn't like that they introduced and killed Dahj immediately. Even in that short time I developed some attachment to the character.

ICHEB NOOOOO!  (thought it was a good scene though regardless). 

HUGH NOOOOO! (Okay thought this was pointless.)

Also thought Raffi overdid it on the JL, though I do like the nickname overall because it shows that Picard has thawed a bit in the interpersonal department, which does really show as he reflects on his old crew, and specifically his relationship with Data. I think the end of Nemesis may have really shaken him.

The Borg cube scenes were boring until they weren't, but I enjoyed them alot more on my second run through. I think the weekly format hindered the pace at times and it will likely be more enjoyable now that it's all out. 

The concept grew on me the more I watched it, but I did roll my eyes at another super double mega secret Romulan intelligence agency. Though when they presented it more like a cult it made more sense to me. 

Yeah the copy and paste Starfleet ships were pretty disappointing. However I enjoyed pretty much everything else about that scene so I didn't let it hinder my enjoyment. Did really want to see the Enterprise or the Titan though. Ah well. I think the Starfleet has become Uber militaristic point makes sense, I would have preferred a smaller standoff tho. 

I prefer episodic shows overall and do miss that. Or at least I prefer the DS9 mix of episodic and serialized. I liked that Discovery took an occasional bottle episode break in their first two seasons. Star Dust City Rag came close though, as I found the heist element to be very fun. 

Also agree the AI plot is pretty overdone, since it's been handled by Discovery... Fallout 4...Altered Carbon... Black Mirror... Ect. However I liked the use of the androids as a stand-in for the subject of human rights. The entire season to me was a great sequel to Measure of A Man. The evil AI part takes a backseat for me anyway, the important part was conveying that these people are being unfairly treated. It was a great analogy for alot of things going on in the world. I would have preferred the super evil AI ended up being benevolent and they very well could be. The writers seemed to keep it intentionally vague. 

Jurati killed a guy, although she's my favorite despite that. Although they forgive people for alot of similar things in the course of Star Trek. 

I didn't like the magical imagination tool until people started comparing it to the Exocomps. I probably would have preferred they presented that tool differently, but I chalk it up to the characters seeing it that way, not it necessarily being a magical fix everything tool. 

In the penultimate episode I thought Soong and Sutra were being a bit too evil. I think it was misdirection but it was a bit over the top,especially in Soong's case since he 180'd right away. Didn't spoil my overall enjoyment though and it did remind me of times in my own past I jumped on a bandwagon because it felt right,even tho I was wrong. I think Soong took a similar path. Sutra I think got caught up in the vision and drove her mad somewhat. 

Wanted more from the Borg cube, but I didn't feel like it was a waste. I hope they use the Short Treks to show the xB community living among the synths. Maybe this becomes a plot point later on, as Hugh hinted he wanted Picard to be an advocate for them. 

What I liked. 

The callback and Easter eggs were done very tastefully. I don't recall a point where I was annoyed by any of them and they did a really good job putting in things that only someone like me who has watched the old series a zillion times would get. I was pretty happy with all the Voyager representation. A show I feel is very underrated. 

Seeing Seven again was so cool! I never thought I'd see her again. I love that they made her a freedom fighter, as she never seemed to quite fit the Starfleet aestetic during Voyager. I like that they showed her regretting taking part in the revenge by killing those people. She did live on a ship full of Maquis so must have absorbed some of their philosophy. 

The entire episode with the Rikers. This is also where I felt the show went from very good to excellent. 

I like them showing different types of Romulans. 

Narissa gleefully gunning the the xBs in front of Hugh and him breaking down crying broke my heart and made me hate her with a passion. I really felt for Hugh there. 

I really like the crew. The time they spent on character development in the second half, especially on Raffi and Rios was fun. 

Raffi's backstory really broke my heart. I'm looking forward to seeing more from her. 

Rios' holograms was such a fun distraction while doing a great job filling in his backstory. 

Picard having PTSD on the Cube gave me major anxiety for him. I thought it was presented very well. I've seen some criticism that ""he's never shown that before."" We've never seen him dealing with it. As someone that likes to shove my problems in boxes and deal with them later I can relate. I've also seen people say it undoes the growth done in the original episode with Hugh. I disagree. Emotions make people do weird things. People in real life aren't always monolithic and consistent. I don't like it when fictional characters are either. 

When Jurati was gushing all over Soji being a work of art and she confronted her by asking if she saw her as a person it felt really powerful to me. That was the lesson I think this series had, we don't treat ""others"" like people. 

Picard and Data getting that last scene together is something I've been wanting since 2002. That scene turned me into a human Waterpark. While it seemed weird they decided to kill him off again, my assumption is living in a simulation like that really throws out the meaning of time. Data likely was able to simulate everything he'd ever want to experience in that place. Really reminded me of Quinn from Voyager. 

I like that they left alot of things kinda vague so we can speculate on how things work and the world overall works. We have hopefully a whole series going forward to fill some of that in, and if not... I have fun speculating. 

I think it's a mistake to view the legacy characters as being the same people we saw 30+ years ago. People change. I am not the same person I was 10 years ago, 20 years ago. I would not expect that to be the case for anyone. I'll being up something I keep seeing people parrot from RLM about Picard and Data not being close. First of all that's not true, there were many instances of Picard helping Data with his interests in humanity. They were friends, they were close friends. Data and Geordie being best friends has little relevance to that scenario. Picard in this show even admits that his capacity for showing emotion was limited and also admitted as much in the TNG episode where he dated the Geologist. He kept the crew at arms length because he felt like he had to. He is no longer bound by that now that he is retired. He also likely views his relationship with Data much differently post Nemesis as he saved his life and he didn't understand why. He is suffering from survivors guilt. Data even shows surprise in the scene when Picard is admitting this to him. I don't think he knew. 

And finally. Characters making strange decisions that don't make sense sometimes isn't bad writing. It's human. Sometimes people make bad choices even when they know they are making a bad choice. People expecting fictional characters to be perfect makes for boring characters. I like when characters are flawed, wrong, or inconsistent. That's life."

There are many scenes that show Picard having a significant relationship with Data in TNG, and the show even awknowledges Picard had difficulty showing his feelings towards a member of the crew. Add to it the 20 or so years of Picard suffering from survivor's guilt he also most likely developed a different view on their relationship over time, perhaps regretting not being closer to him while he was alive. Nothing that was shown in this series is out of place with what has been established."
