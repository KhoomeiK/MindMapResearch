depressed,fisbiyc,t1_fisaupf,1582681673.0,Ending shit at thirteen is not the way to go.
depressed,fisaauk,t1_fis9efo,1582681012.0,I think a big part of it is not having strong friendships and school. My only friends are my ex girlfriend and my boyfriend. So yeah just that sentence explains a lot.
depressed,fisa1hk,t3_f9l5rj,1582680875.0,You are so young and have so much time to turn your life around. People will forgot when someone else does something. You will move on to another school. Just don’t focus on the social aspect as much right now. Tell your therapist and dad you feel suicidal and get help. You still have a chance!

StardewValley,ffrjo6x,t1_ffriop2,1580159392.0,Good point. I didn’t really think about that but it’s kinda a waste of time to make paths right now. I’ll focus on clearing more space!
