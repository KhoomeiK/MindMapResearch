EatingDisorders,fdk20tp,t3_elr3zg,1578494105.0,"It hurts when the people we love the most come up short.  Sometimes the sanest thing you can do is accept your mom loves you, despite its imperfections. And flawed as it may feel, holding onto anger or resentment towards her will only really hurt you . It’s okay to say “I have a mother who doesn’t get my e.d but I know she loves me”."

You may well decide you hate what life is like without an eating disorder and go right back to it, or you may decide that it’s a welcome relief.   You won’t know until you are in that space."

EatingDisorders,fdey3bh,t3_eksgr8,1578349049.0,"You need to be so much more compassionate with yourself and give yourself a giant break. First, there will always be someone prettier, thinner, more perfect , more wealthy, etc etc etc than you. If you look to compare yourself with people around you, you will always find someone better at x,y.z.   So forget all that noise, forget all the girls on campus who look like they have their act together and focus all your care and attention on one girl: you.   The only girl you are in competition with is YOU.   Make goals for yourself based on where you’ve been and who you are. This is how people blossom. And your guy friends, bless their hearts, I assume these are 18/19 year olds trying to help you- they aren’t. Don’t ask them for validation or their opinion.  You validate your worth for you - not them. Seek the advice a guidance of people sensitive to eating disorders; perhaps a support group on campus or talking with professionals who can safely help you feel healthier in your body."

This disease is so insidious, if you are honest with yourself, is this someone who does more to trigger or would be supportive ? I personally couldn’t live with anyone who was already fat shaming women.  You will drive yourself insane wondering if you are thin enough for him.  Given your decade long struggle, does it make any sense to be with someone who you know would have a problem with weight gain?"
