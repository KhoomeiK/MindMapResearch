destiny2,f1rn9t0,t3_dao6p9,1569717696.0,"its never too late to hop in, but Def helps if you find some people to play with. I would recommend the DLC tho just cause it'll be hard to either find people to play with plus you'll miss out on a lot of great story and many unavailable features that come with the DLC's. but, if you don't feel comfortable buying the DLC's right now, you still have a lot of content with the free package to give you time to really get used to destiny."
