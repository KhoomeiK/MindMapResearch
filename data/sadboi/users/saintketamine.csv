ADHD,fna74hf,t3_g0gqel,1586792284.0,"remember a lot of it is behavioral. he doesn’t think any differently of you, he’s just in his head. there are ways to work through this.

kind words and activities together (movies or shows
you enjoy, listening to an album
together, cooking, etc) work well to pull someone back to the present as long as they can focus on it. 

i would also recommend building a small routine of
some sort. my partner and i have had success in the past by sticking to a morning routine together while long distance (wake up, coffee, cook breakfast, now adding yoga). just having that little bit of structure at the beginning of the day helps a lot.

most of all, ensure you communicate your feelings in a productive way towards them so they can understand that you love them, you’re just needing something that you know they’re already capable of but haven’t seen recently. there’s no point in suffering through something they aren’t even aware of. talk it out, you’ll probably be pleasantly surprised. 


all the best to you both 🥰"

terracehouse,fm0xnc8,t1_fm0ulz0,1585668182.0,"> A chaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from himself suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.

>Chaotic neutral is the best alignment you can be because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.

>Chaotic neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it seeks to eliminate all authority, harmony, and order in society."
