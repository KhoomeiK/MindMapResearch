seduction,fh8q4bt,t1_fh8q0fw,1581365052.0,What is?
seduction,fh8fzgb,t1_fh8etcp,1581358925.0,You are right but this is definitely a good thing to do in general
seduction,fh7yu3h,t1_fh7xwxw,1581348157.0,"I have been talking to some people at my school, but I dont know how to make it so that they start inviting me to hangout with them. It is usually just a quick conversation and that is about it."
seduction,fh7u3s3,t1_fh7ty9c,1581344755.0,You got any links to videos that I can watch. I will definitely try to do this!
seduction,fh7tqvu,t3_f1q7y6,1581344483.0,"This shit is so underrated, but it is also pretty hard to do for someone that is introverted and isn't that social."
sex,fft3jnk,t3_ev3fbe,1580205187.0,I wanna know as well because I have no clue
sex,fft1lew,t3_ev22qn,1580202172.0,"Basically happend to me as well ""I never came like that before, you're amazing"""
NoFap,ff4f0et,t1_ff4dljb,1579562040.0,Okay I will also try some meditation in the morning
NoFap,ff4dkvg,t1_ff4ddq2,1579561087.0,"I will definitely try that, so I am off to bed now."
NoFap,ff4d04y,t1_ff4cvf0,1579560709.0,But what is something that I can do right now?
heartbreak,febzkvk,t1_febytpe,1578964609.0,Do you know him?
BreakUps,fdqd1el,t1_fdqazu6,1578663402.0,"But now after she has him and we are not allowed to talk, she still sends me messages and replies to my stories on insta and sends me emotional posts on insta. What should I think of that?"
BreakUps,fdq2dr1,t3_emj3dq,1578651481.0,This is exactly how I feel. I dont want to forget those things.
BreakUps,fdpzwti,t3_emnez4,1578647959.0,I had the same thing it took me by suprise after a 6 year relationship. I am now 6 months out and just had a mental breakdown for the first time since the break up. She told me she had someone newin her life and that he doesnt want  us to talk. We had been best friends after the breakup.
BreakUps,fdoj7v2,t1_fdoiq3i,1578606240.0,"Dude deep down I feel the same way. But if you keep on saying it and talking/thinking like that it is only going to be harder for you. Just for one day I want you to act like you dont need her and that she was the worst decision of your life and just chill with friends and family and go party or something. Even if it is not true you will start to feel like it. 

Since you are only waiting might as well just make the best of it. If she texts you it makes no difference if you have been missing her or enjoying your time. It might even be better if you have been having a good time, because you will have good vibes and that is what attracts people."
BreakUps,fdohr9e,t1_fdohl0f,1578605396.0,You got this man if you ever need to talk to someone just PM me
BreakUps,fdohq0u,t1_fdohl0f,1578605377.0,That's what I am saying. I also just had a mental breakdown after 6 months. And I am starting to feel better again. You just have to go on with your life again and meet new people or do new things and keep busy.
BreakUps,fdohf8u,t1_fdo4ut7,1578605205.0,You know what they say. Fake it till you make it. These people will help you take your mind of her.
BreakUps,fdo3zyw,t1_fdo3q24,1578598483.0,Have you already tried putting yourself out there again? Reconnecting with old friends or new people?
BreakUps,fdo2wy8,t1_fdo2la9,1578597909.0,Well I never said that she has completely forgotten you I am just saying that she is trying to move on. I am currently trying no contact with my ex but I have only been truly no contact for 5 days so dont take my advice to seriously. But if you really need closure you can always hit her up and ask her to talk. If she says no then you have your answer and if she says yes you can decide with her what options you still have. But dont expect anything from it or you will get hurt even more.
BreakUps,fdo22xa,t1_fdo1d4g,1578597470.0,Okay well in that case you should assume the worst and that is that she moved on and if she thinks about you she will quickly try to think of something else. This might be hard to hear but you should try to do the same. Deal with your feelings and replace them with other things.
BreakUps,fdo0r82,t1_fdo0bis,1578596746.0,She broke up via text?
BreakUps,fdnzdtx,t1_fdnwese,1578595941.0,"I am not exactly sure, did she have any intention of staying friends after the break up?"
BreakUps,fdnvtgm,t1_fdnvdo3,1578593868.0,No I am not saying you are not doing anything. I am just saying that you are not letting the things that you do take over your mind for a bit.
BreakUps,fdnuq40,t1_fdnucno,1578593228.0,Just try to do things with a purpose if you want someone bad enough and you spend alot of time and energy on it the  that will take over your mind even if it is just for 5 minutes. And then just keep on trying to get those 5 minutes until it takes over your whole day.
BreakUps,fdnsk45,t1_fdnrvik,1578591975.0,"Yes my plan was to atleast not contact her for the next 6 months since I am going abroad for my study abroad anyways. And after that see how I feel about her and ofcourse see if she still has a relation(hopefully not). 

Still wondering what I should do if she texts me or replies to my stories. Like she has been super nice to me and tried her best not to hurt me with everything and was there for me during my mental breakdown even though she was not allowed to. What should I do if she texts/calls or replies to my insta story?"
BreakUps,fdnrqki,t1_fdnrjms,1578591506.0,But what if I just want her even if it is just a best friends? What can I do to atleast have a chance at that in the future
BreakUps,fdnrl33,t1_fdnrccx,1578591434.0,I know how you feel because this is exactly how I feel right now. But I think you should atleast enjoy life and start making friends men and women and build a connection with them and enjoy your time. Just try to be too busy to think about her all the time and you will definitely feel better.
BreakUps,fdnr5t0,t1_fdnqskm,1578591227.0,See my response to the other dude above
BreakUps,fdnr48c,t1_fdnqrtc,1578591205.0,"Thank you I just dont know what to think right now. Basically she was my best friend even after the break up. But this new guy doesnt want us to talk and she told me that last weekend and that was also when she told me that she has someone else. I basically had a mental breakdown for 5 days since then and I am finally getting back up a bit again. 

She is still sending me random text and replying to my instagram stories eventhough she is not allowed to text me. So I am not sure what to do."
BreakUps,fdnqnkh,t1_fdnqkuq,1578590977.0,And I feel exactly the same way. But my ex has someone else in her life now...
BreakUps,fdnqkuq,t1_fdnqfzn,1578590940.0,I can understand your feeling. I lost my first and only love of a 6 year relationship 6 months ago.
BreakUps,fdnq2b4,t1_fdno8w3,1578590699.0,"Okay so my honest opinion is that you should try to let it go. Like you said you already begged her and that didn't work. She is definitely not interested in a relation at the moment, but that doesnt mean that she does not think about you. However the best thing to do for you is to focus on creating new friends and meeting new people. If you already feel like this after 3 years with her, just imagine what it can feel like with someone equal/better after 5 years. Just out yourself out there and enjoy life and the things that you can control. If she ever messages you you will be a different person and you might already have someone better and then you can show her what she put you through."
BreakUps,fdnmkrh,t1_fdnmdwk,1578588927.0,I am 100% sure that he has thought about you this week atleast once. Can you tell me a bit more about what happend. Like why did you break up and what did you do after the break up and why no contact?
BreakUps,fdnm7ur,t1_fdnid15,1578588718.0,"Let me tell you one thing, there will be times where she thinks of you no matter how long it has been. Even if she has moved on."
BreakUps,fdnlheg,t1_fdnlcef,1578588287.0,"Oeh that is still fresh, how long was the relation"
BreakUps,fdnh7ew,t1_fdng7rp,1578585735.0,Well it just hurts me more when she talks to me and I respond and then she just starts responding very short
BreakUps,fdnfy9l,t1_fdne11b,1578584975.0,"I feel you man. I think I messed it up as well, we were 6 years together and she was my first love. I tried to be friends for the first 6 months, but she recently got someone new in her life and I had to go no contact(she still messages me every now and then) because he doesnt want us to talk. I hope that they break up and she realizes that she needs me. And then I will see if I still need it."
BreakUps,fdnczcd,t1_fdn4x1s,1578583146.0,How long has it been?
BreakUps,fdncv5w,t1_fdn62cp,1578583073.0,I drank so much last weekend (6months after breakup) and I also had a mental breakdown for the first time in my life and it is still going a bit 5 days later...
BreakUps,fdncrnb,t3_em9ige,1578583010.0,"I feel you, I want her to want me and then I can make the choice and see if I can still work with it."
Anxiety,fdn8vlq,t1_fdn8ckq,1578580394.0,I feel you on the depression/anxiety but I am not that critical on my body at the moment. I prioritize my mental health over my physique
Anxiety,fdmv0jo,t1_fdm7sq7,1578567100.0,I feel you man. I dont even know what to do anymore I just feel bad in my own body.
BreakUps,fdhtoxy,t1_fdhnwpc,1578429969.0,I wish you all the best. And I can only hope that I can try again with my ex of a 6 year relationship (I am only 20 years old)
BreakUps,fdhagbn,t1_fdh8qso,1578418855.0,"I think this might be true, maybe I was still hoping to reconnect or atleast be best friend. But as of now I am still hoping that for some reason we can still be best friend or atleast when their relationship ends."
BreakUps,fdh3ora,t3_elcixp,1578414698.0,Well I know that feeling and I dont know the reason for the breakup or your current relation with her. But some times it is better/easier to find a similiar fish in this big ocean then to waste your whole life on this one.
BreakUps,fdh21on,t3_elcixp,1578413683.0,But the answers do those question matter. Like if she cries when she wears my clothes it means that it was real. It means that she still cares and that maybe all we needed was a break and to explore things and that maybe 5 years from now when we both have become what we wanted from life that it can still workout.
seduction,fdgtxni,t3_elbvs9,1578408238.0,Hey man I am also from the Netherlands (Arnhem). However I will be in the UK for 6 months but I am still willing to work on this with you.
heartbreak,fdf3pc3,t3_el1ols,1578352597.0,"I know this feeling, this is exactly how I feel after 6 months. Stay strong!"
BreakUps,fdedp1k,t3_ekwo0j,1578336769.0,"I am in the same place as you right now but I had a 6 year long relationship and it has been 6 months since it ended. She just told me that she has someone else in her life. 

My plan is to make a list of things that I can improve in myself. This list will make her regret leaving me as well as help me be happy with myself and help with finding someone else. I will be working on this list for atleast 6 months with (initially) her in mind. And after 6 months I will most likely be more happy with myself and maybe even decide that she is not even worth the person that I am at that moment anymore. 

I think this might help you as well."
BreakUps,fdecawu,t1_fdeburr,1578335900.0,"Thanks I would love someone to listen to my story and tell me if I am being realistic and if I see it the right way. 

I know for a fact that she likes talking to me and that we would still be able to talk. However over text she is replying kinda short and I am not sure if I want to put as much effort in. Whenever she text me I just want to talk like we used to, but that is not happening most likely."
BreakUps,fdebc8b,t1_fde8ooh,1578335295.0,Well I followed my gut and tried to be friends with her but a few days ago she told me she had someone else in her life and that if it gets serious she wont be able to talk as much. So that kinda(alot) hurt me
BreakUps,fddugq6,t3_ekuynq,1578324268.0,This is exactly how I feel and I dont have anyone to talk about it. I am kinda clueless right now.
BreakUps,fdds562,t3_ekut40,1578322569.0,"Well I had the same thing with my ex but I have these feeling 6 months after she broke up with me. But she still wants to be best friends but I dont know how, because her actions show otherwise."
