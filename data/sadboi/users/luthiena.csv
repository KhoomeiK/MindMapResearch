The store where I bought it gave me a new joycon and it seemed fine. I also treat my consoles gently as I do not earn too much money and I have to save up when I want anything.

After a few months the joycons stopped working properly. I played splatoon a lot so I guess that's why the left joycon stick started drifting. Then by trying to play multiplayer games I noticed the right one is not detected by the console and the same happened to one of my bf joycons.

It's a joke... I get very angry because they do not change the poor quality materials and it seems they just don't care... And why do I have to lose time and money so they fix it?  Come on, there are a lot of people with these problems.
