DBZDokkanBattle,fjfpdf3,t1_fjfp33g,1583296800.0,I remember the depression arc i went through trying to get Gogeta. So many Paikuhans lol
depression,epdxdra,t1_epdwhyc,1559175830.0,"oohh i understand. keep those friends. trust me, they’ll make things so much better. and if you truly feel that way then you have to find another job. or find a side job  that you like."
depression,epdx33o,t1_epdcd5t,1559175662.0,"don’t thank me. i just want to see people on this subreddit find the happiness they deserve because i just found some and i want to help all of you now. if you need anything just message me, i’m here for you. never give up, i promise you’ll make it!!"
depression,epb6edc,t3_buaxg0,1559138366.0,"i understand what you mean. your family’s opinion means a lot to you. but if you feel like they make you have to change who you are just so you can get their acknowledgement, then you just have to cut it off. you should never feel as though you must change your character to get the acceptance of someone even family. if they are mad at how you grow then you should just ignore it. they’ll realize how wrong they were in the future."
depression,epb5oun,t3_buduo5,1559138098.0,"try making your job fun. make the most out of it by finding fellow coworkers and becoming friends with them. if you can’t then i guess you’ll have to find another job in which you can be happy at. in my opinion, a job which makes you happy but has an average pay is better than having a job that makes you depressed and has an amazing pay."
depression,epb380s,t3_budtes,1559137130.0,"hey. i know this sounds like a broken record, but please, keep reaching out. eventually someone will grab your hand and help you. i understand entirely how you feel. to feel helpless, abandoned, and isolated. i know this too well. i was about to take my own life until a random person told me a lot. she helped me get over things that i couldn’t do alone. again i didn’t even know her. it’s people like those that we need in this world. i’m willing to be that person for you. i’ve been through this and i don’t want anyone else on this planet to go through it again."
depression,epaykpi,t3_bubcqr,1559135299.0,"Hi. i may be really younger than you (i’ve just turned 17) but i think i understand what you’re going through. i’ve never been able to get a date in my life, nor have i had a girlfriend or a first anything with a girl. a couple years ago i’ve felt that exact same way. i couldn’t feel anything. eventually i went out to a therapist and even they wouldn’t work. i was on the verge of giving up.  until i went on social media and reached out for help. you’re on the right track. there are people in this world who’re willing to be your friend and try everything in their power to make sure you feel a positive feeling again. like me. there’s nothing wrong with you. people just misunderstand you. in this day and age people just love to judge others to make themselves feel better and frankly, it’s sickening. you seem like a real down to earth person and i want you to live because the world truly needs people like you. you are useful to this world."
depression,epax6fg,t3_bue9q3,1559134740.0,"it’s going to be ok buddy. i’m here for you and i’m sure everyone else on this sub is. you just have to be strong. not the strongest in the world, but the strongest person YOU can be. your mom would love that."
