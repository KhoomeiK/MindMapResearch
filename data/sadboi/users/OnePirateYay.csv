WeightLossAdvice,fj6gcx8,t3_fbdqlh,1583071064.0,"I was 233lbs, now I'm 154lbs, and I still feel like ""the fat girl"", in the same situations as you described. I know exactly what you mean.
I told my psychologist about it and she talked about body disassociation, but I couldn't afford to keep going there. So I recommend you go to a psychologist and look better into it.

Also, I made a few collages with old and new pictures and kept in my drive and look whenever I feel like this, which is pretty often. That might help.

If you want to, you can message me, since I've never seen anyone with a similar problem to me here before, I think it would be nice to have someone to talk about it support each other :)"

depression,fblsokp,t3_edpkii,1576969266.0,"Happens to me too. Sometimes I'm so tired/frustrated and end up being rude. Happens mostly with my family, when they don't get why I feel so tired and ask me to help around the house.."
depression,fb1p1e7,t1_fb1j45m,1576439205.0,Thank you. I'll try my best to use this method of thinking. Thank you so so much.
depression,fab9oqo,t3_e8anzg,1575919889.0,"I used to feel the same when I was 14. I tried a few times to be someone I wasn't and it just made me feel really tired, so I don't recommend that. 

Keep enjoying the things you enjoy, be your authentic self. Right now it may seem not anyone else your age like the same stuff but as you grow older you'll see it takes a while to find people with the same interests, it's okay, I promise you when you find these people you'll be friends for a long long time. Depression makes going out very complicated, what made me feel less scared about it was taking few steps, like going to a library by myself.

I made some friends online as I grew older, that's how I met people with very similar interests, so try and do that (but also be careful).

Things will get better soon. :)"
