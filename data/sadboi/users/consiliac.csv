And your profile reads to me as a mess of different voices, and as such, I don't get a sense of you. The parts where I most detect a personality are the awkward jokes/tortured word choice, which probably reflect more your attempt at original writing than what actually having a conversation with you might be like.

Maybe this is too early to claim to notice such powerful changes or to tie the cause to a mere three days without a drop, but I certainly want to keep going and see how much of the old me I forgot existed (a person with physical and mental energy and interest to do things other than find a new bar serving craft beer) I can recover if I stay away from alcohol and confine my intake to social drinking on the weekends"
stopdrinking,fotpfel,t3_g987kv,1588061448.0,"As much as I love craft beer, I think that that beer has become that delicious and something to be explored and talked about with community around it has really turned a lot of casual drinkers into habitual (if they're fortunate to not be genetically-predisposed) alcoholics. I know I am one, and I'm only now finally getting a hold on myself thanks to corona shutting all my brewpubs down. I hope I can maintain this beyond corona."
datingoverthirty,fotcjch,t1_fos53p3,1588050066.0,"I doubt that latter bit, I don't think you've really proved them on it, as there is likely a spectrum or physical characteristics on balance that appeal to them. Also, your list reads as ""must be perfect""."

Having people over for a cookout implies he's pretty social or at least trying to be. But my point was just that there are fairly understandable reasons for why guys don't want to befriend women for whom they have a romantic or strong, unreciprocated sexual interest in, especially when they're single, and they're not necessarily assholes for preferring to move on."
datingoverthirty,forivkj,t1_forifzk,1588012986.0,"Are you warm-hearted? Make women feel good in your presence? Connect with them on dates?

you can be absolutely golden and get dates, and still not have good dates because the women aren't having fun, or don't feel they're connecting with you, or don't feel desired by you, etc., whatever it is they're hoping to feel by going on a date with you. 

Also, when it comes to making a relationship, they need to see themselves factoring into your life somehow, even if that's just cuddling together the nights a week watching shared favorite Netflix shows."
datingoverthirty,forhm2j,t1_forgjc7,1588012374.0,"I'm not really advocating for paying for one, I only know they exist from dating self-help sites like DoctorNerdLove, but, I would guess that it's the dating coach's job? He or she would follow you around or review all the details of your interactions and offer a critical eye and practical advice. A friend who dates well could do the same, but do you have one with that kind of time and willingness to help? And the coach would presumably have experience with a variety of cases, and perhaps yours would be recognizable to them.

There are also internet groups out there where men cheer and support and provide analysis for each other I think. But I would bet my right ear that the common refrain for many would be ""lift weights and get swell first, bro""."
datingoverthirty,forfhr5,t1_ford3by,1588011344.0,"Thanks for answering, that sounds quite organic!

Adam's friend probably has a pretty healthy social and dating/sex life. That really takes the sting out of the occasional rejection."

datingoverthirty,forde1o,t1_for56gr,1588010322.0,A lot of the virtue/awareness signalling we educated liberal types do reflexively in the USA is utterly lost on and perceived as pure narcissism by people in other parts of the world. Just my two cents after living in Asia for a while.

japanlife,fond2xy,t1_fomq7tj,1587917153.0,"This is golden advice. It's frustrating for everyone to have to prolong conversations and nail everything down to their precise details (for you, the one struggling with the language as a non-native, and for the native co-workers who are probably terribly impatient with you), but assuming you understand something, working for a while, and then getting yelled at for your lack of full understanding is no fun."

datingoverthirty,fo9h7ru,t1_fo9gmvq,1587619446.0,"You mean, why do I ask? Just wondering what the social context is like. Going entirely by yourself to a e.g. club and trying to approach girls, who are almost always in groups, has a much higher difficulty level, and they'll inevitably ask ""are you here by yourself?"", with the unspoken assumption that you're a loser or a creep if the answer is an unqualified yes. I guess it also depends on the city/district/country/norms of the people who go to the venue. If you're tall and muscular and/or just ooze confidence and self-comfort, it will lower that risk, but getting to that level would take a hell of a lot of practice."

If you can communicate to people, hey, you're just short-term for me, have that relationship, and look for someone else to be long-term at the same time, without adding yet another short-term relationship for someone who ""is almost the LTR but not quite"",  kudos, but I think most people have not got that much time or emotional and mental bandwidth, and many people see the LTR unicorn as the goal but will not get there without realizing it takes a deliberate effort of will."
