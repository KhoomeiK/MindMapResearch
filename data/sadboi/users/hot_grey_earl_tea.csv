We were homeless more than once, and we never were able to settle.

He taught me pride, modesty, and invoked in me and my brothers wonder, introspection, and voracious appetites for knowledge. He valued integrity and authenticity above all, and imparted these attributes to us. We are all adults now. All of us have a college education, and all relatively happy and successful.
