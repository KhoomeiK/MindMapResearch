The thing that's been helping me is setting aside time during the day for certain tasks and setting lots of alarms. This way I'm not constantly saddled with worrying about whether I forget to do something and can hopefully stay on task. I've also been setting time limits for doing those things and use the timer on my phone too, like I have 10 minutes to answer those emails and that's it.

The quick and dirty answer is that I don't. It was super easy to cut off contact with them, as they've never called me once after I got married, and that was almost 15 years ago. I was partially moved out when I got engaged, and when they found out about that they really wanted my stuff out, so they'd call me every morning at 6 am when they knew I got done with work at 4 am to get my shit out.... until it was out.

On the other hand, I can start when I want when working from home, so that's the nice thing I guess.

Back when I was 13 my dad and i moved in with his then fiancee and her daughter. There was a day that me and his fiancee got into an argument, and my dad is trying to smooth things over because their relationship apparently was that strained at that time. So he told me I needed to get myself together and give a sincere apology without any crying whatsoever. When I thought I'd be okay enough to apologize I just couldn't without breaking down in tears. I was berated and the apology was harshly rejected because I wasnt being sincere enough. She then gave the ultimatum to him that he chose her or me, so needless to say we moved out that week. 

A year later he got married to my stepmother and we moved again.... and he probably told her about the previous snafu, so every time I so much as said anything to express displeasure (mostly about being constantly hungry tbh) I was accused of being manipulative and trying to break those two up. 

That taught me very quickly to be constantly making sure that I stay in my lane, even when i dont think i am even veering out of it. Even now, being out of that environment for almost 20 years, I'm still paranoid that people are gonna think that I'm just intruding on others' rights by basically existing.

I've found journaling helpful, if not to hash out things I feel strongly about, my values, that sort of thing. It's been helping me become who I am and who I want to work toward becoming. I also started this process by trying new things, starting with something basic and general like varying outfits and twists on the same old clothes I haven't worn in a while to get a feel for what I like.

I guess the best thing to keep in mind is just.. be patient with it unless it's really giving you hell of course.

Best wishes!"
Effexor,fibterg,t3_f7gt7y,1582329691.0,"Since you just started on the venlafaxine yesterday I would give it some time for you to adjust to it... theres a chance the insomnia might just kick itself to the curb after a few weeks. 

I'm actually on the same dose of both and have recently upped trazodone from 50 mg to 100 with no noticeable bad effects so far, but I've been on the effexor since the beginning of December and my issue was basically waking up several times a night at the same time.

Wishing you the best!"
Effexor,fi5m347,t1_fi5bf94,1582165993.0,You're welcome for sure! I'll keep you posted
Effexor,fi5b2u6,t1_fi59oo1,1582159010.0,Just yesterday -- I saw my psychiatrist about not being able to fully stay asleep and waking up a few times a night. She suggested I try upping the dose since I'm not feeling groggy from the trazodone in the mornings. I'm not sure how much better this is yet.
Effexor,fi58ol3,t3_f68yws,1582157430.0,"(34F on 75 mg effexor and recently upped to 75-100mg trazodone from 50 mg, and this is strictly for insomnia) 

The first few weeks my performance absolutely tanked, but after that it came back. Also my sex drive went up noticeably (like doubled) after starting the trazodone but honestly I chalk it up to the effexor finally kicking in at that point, not being ultra depressed 24/7, and actually getting some sleep for once lol"
EffexorSuccess,fhw25i9,t1_fhw11ty,1581904810.0,you're welcome! Best wishes to you!
EffexorSuccess,fhvmfy9,t3_f4xdzw,1581898925.0,"I struggled for about 3 weeks with fatigue, and then after that point it was all gravy until Suddenly Insomnia... after another two weeks of that I was in my therapist's office crying about it and she actually got my PCP in and we talked a bit and she put a script in for trazodone -- after that the fatigue really diminished. Not perfect, but I'm pretty functional at this point, I can't complain.

I'd say give it a few weeks, your body is still adjusting and working itself out with regard to the onboarding effects. If anything too severe is going on, definitely let your provider know."
EffexorSuccess,fhr4j1b,t1_fhq19lf,1581817166.0,"Hey there!!

I have no trouble falling asleep - I'm usually out within an hour of popping the trazodone. Staying asleep is a different beast and I'm finding I'm waking up at 2:30 am and 4:30 am consistently. 

As for the gabapentin I've heard of it, but more for the pain use. I have an appointment with the psychiatrist on Tuesday to talk about my meds, but in the meantime I'm gonna read up on that now that you stirred my curiosity - I appreciate this."
Effexor,fh9mx82,t3_f1uo9w,1581384999.0,Hey congrats! I'm happy for you! Here's to the journey of self-improvement and many more ups than downs in the future 🎉
EffexorSuccess,fh1i14w,t1_fh1aynh,1581215715.0,"Hey you're good. 

As far as the trazodone goes, it does wonders at making me sedated and I'm usually asleep within an hour of taking it. My big issue is just waking up throughout the night still. It used to be much worse without it though.

On that, trazodone wasn't originally used for sleep - it was an antidepressant back in the day - but its since been used less for depression/anxiety and more as a sleep aid these days since it has that added effect of making one sleepy. This is probably what your doctor means when saying it's not the same. My doctor didnt want to put me on ambien or other things because some of them can be habit forming so this is what I got. 

I know you mentioned you didnt want to be on meds forever, and while that's also my desire, I also feel like I'm better off going medicated at least until my providers and I are in agreement that I'm thriving. But I also know that everyone's brains are different and theres a very real chance I'm gonna need this indefinitely. While I'm not particularly jazzed about that kind of future, I also would rather stay on it if it means I don't end up kicking my own ass someday. 

It seems like you already talked to your doctor about how you reacted to the seroquel. Are they offering up any alternatives?"

Anxiety,fgr8glm,t3_ezz9ce,1581040711.0,"Here's what I tried and my findings: 

Prozac 10 mg: hooo boy. Dropped 8 lb in 2 weeks bc I was intermittently feeling sick (I'm pretty small to begin with), only could get 4-5h sleep a night and be woken up having racing thoughts, and the only thing I could stay focused on long enough was sewing. I made a lot of things in the 4 weeks I was on it, but it didnt really help otherwise. 

Zoloft 25 mg: BRAIN FOG GALORE. I couldn't remember commitments I made, couldn't focus at work, couldn't sleep, and was tired all the time. This also did nothing to touch my issues. Again I dropped this after 4 weeks.

Effexor 75 mg: I wasn't putting much stock in this at this point, but I was at the end of my rope. The first night I made the mistake of not taking it with a substantial amount of food. I woke up in a sweat and heaving. Gave me some weird neck stiffness for a couple of days and I had legit headaches for a while. Side effects varied from day to day it seemed until about 6 weeks in, then the only bad thing I still had and continue to have is insomnia. I have trazodone to help out with this. I noticed real improvement in both anxiety and depression at 7 weeks, like I'm better able to handle things, and I've had close friends tell me I seem calmer. I've been on this for 9 weeks now. Party on!"
Effexor,fgkktwc,t3_ez1gg0,1580867893.0,"Hey there! I started at 75, got some onboarding side effects, but nothing extremo monumental (your experience may vary). The one strong recommendation I have is to take it with some food - don't leave your stomach empty. If you have extreme side effects right off or you're feeling worse after some time on this, make your best judgment call in talking to your doc about adjusting the dose.

Wishing you the best!"
Anxiety,fgh950k,t3_ey4u92,1580779579.0,"(Cw: emotional/verbal abuse) 

Yeeeesss, holy! I'm pretty sure constantly being told I'm an embarrassment and that I'm wasting my dad's retirement money on basic needs like dental work really did a number on me to silence me. Sometimes I don't know if I did the right thing in a lot of scenarios or whether I even have the right to be angry about it. There's just so much to unpack with all the crap that happened that I just can't attach words to it, much less speak those words, whatever they are. You're definitely not alone OP."

Effexor,fg6vsad,t1_fg6p1zh,1580578026.0,"Yeah, this. It can take upwards of 6 to 10 weeks to feel the full benefit.

Also I don't know if it runs different from extended release but taking this on an empty stomach can be brutal. If you're not already doing so I strongly encourage you to try it with some food. Wishing you the best!"
Anxiety,fg2ccf3,t3_ewhp1e,1580442344.0,"I always had some form of it, but it took me until I started working again in 2015 to realize that having a legitimate dread over being around people and constantly worrying about the way I was perceived by my coworkers wasn't normal, and then I was diagnosed in 2017."
Effexor,fg1ls3p,t3_ew7sxv,1580429389.0,"I've only had one dream for the 7 weeks I've been on this, and that was the night I didnt take it bc I was switching to a morning dose."
Anxiety,ffih3mv,t3_etosiq,1579973723.0,"I have wicked anxiety over talking to colleagues through IM at work. Like, I can just walk to someone's desk/schedule a face-to-face meeting/call them on the telephone and be just fine with it, but IM is just nerve-racking.

Effexor,ffdttrp,t3_et10n7,1579828766.0,"I used to take mine at 9 pm but found it was just making me wake up every hour of the night, so I switched to 9 am. I ended up just delaying my 9 pm dose on saturday night and taking it at 9 am sunday morning with no issue (your mileage may vary). So far, I've been sleeping a lot better. Also I dont know if you're doing this already but make sure you're taking it with a good amount of food, that helped alleviate my nausea."
Effexor,ff1h38a,t3_eqygst,1579479119.0,"I started out on 75 mg at the beginning of December and I've joked that the side effects of this are so inconsistent it's like throwing a dart at a dartboard blindfolded. Had vomiting, exhaustion, lack of focus, and dizziness on top of dizziness. My big one right now is insomnia but I'm hoping changing the time of day I take this helps 🤷‍♂️"
