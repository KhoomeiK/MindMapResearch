ADHD,fn7gxjx,t1_fn79f7v,1586720110.0,"Hey mate. Please forgive the long comment.

In my experience, Anxiety and depression can manifest from ADHD (In my case at least). BUT even without being able to focus along everything that comes with ADHD, I think you need to hear and know that it's never that black and white. You do matter and so do your feelings.

Most of my mates who suffer from depression and/or anxiety say and feel the same way as I do. 

I'm not qualified to say much but I know those two factors (even without ADHD) most times push one to have those same feelings as well as hindering all or some of their productivity.

Whether or NOT, your diagnosed with ADHD, you should know that these other factors affect people in a similar fashion and to make it worse most times its a cycle loop. In my case it kind of goes like this.

For example: 

1. you can be unable to concentrate or even lack the energy to do the most basic things (I cleaned up my room for the first time this week in 2020. My support system was strengthened in the last year so my family and SO help me where they can).

2. I then get very anxious as I feel like a layabout who can't accomplish much so I retreat from the world.

3. The isolation leads to being more depressed than usual.

4. I then start to chastise myself for being a waste because I have to get help or just forego things completely.

5. This is where I either bounce back using copy techniques from my therapist OR where I either run the clock out on a deadline and give up. 

**Leading me to once again impulsively trying to salvage my life by choosing another project or chore.** Hence...

1. Which I either don't start at all or if I do I can't focus due to the ADHD, my attention goes to near zero where I either keep starting different things then jumping before even starting or when I've barely started to something else.. over and over. Which then lead to a spiral into anxiety (No. 2) again. 

Sorry for the long winded explanation. I'm all over today but am glad OP's post has made me finally speak today.

You are worth it. Getting an evaluation helps because it gives you path options rather than feeling your being tugged all over yet not moving or if anything you regress.

Your therapist would be able to offer you the tools and medications (where necessary). I've realised having options really helps. Because when I don't I tail spin and put off things for fear of the unknown yet each time I leap I somehow improve.

**In short, don't discount your feelings. They are valid. If you have family or friends who can ease the transition it's easier but even if you don't... a good doctor would be able to walk you through. Either way you get some help. It's not a zero sum game.**

*The first step is the hardest and if you ever want to talk you can PM, the people who've interestingly helped me told me the same thing and when I finally accepted help.*

*I even got help with my CV from a complete stranger on reddit. who I now regard as my saving grace because I was able to get a few interviews and one job offer this year. Unfortunately it was just before Corvid so I'll have to find another job*

But that's a far cry better than 2019, & an even more disastrous 2018.

I hope you can overlook all the writing. I'm afraid if I try to shorten it further I'll end up not saying anything. I hope that even one sentence or paragraph can help you feel better. You deserve to be happy mate."
ADHD,fn7d6ll,t1_fn6thdm,1586718007.0,"Your feelings are ALWAYS valid mate. I think the previous comment basically summed up my life as well. BUT I also get where you coming from in regards to the feelings of isolation in your own mind and in the real world.

TBH this community along with r/depression & r/anxiety are the reasons I eventually got a reddit account. I love this subreddit most of all (as ADHD is the what lead to depression and anxiety) but when I spiral and feel useless, I can't for the life of me, even find the courage to even lurk around sometimes as my anxiety skyrockets before I do. 

Yet once I beat that demon  though I always know that if I do get the courage to read on, I eventually feel better & not as lost as I constantly feel.

ADHD over a span of a decade took me from being sought after by HR head hunters to drug abuse (in an effort to slow my mind down which just made things a lot worse) to jobless and alone.

These last 3 years have been crazy but I'm picking the pieces each day knowing that a better day is on the horizon. Or at least I hope so. I work part time when I can and I have someone in my life who loves me despite all my faults.

PS: Ive written and discarded this comment over & over for the last hour or so,.. because my brain keeps telling me that no one would care or find anything I say could possibly be worthwhile or helpful as I feel I'm not a ""success story"" but reading what you wrote as well as the initial comment gave me the strength to press the comment post button.

Funny thing is I can post and talk to strangers on reddit in subreddits that have little to no personal referencing. I just get wobbly when I have to be a wee bit serious and personal.

Sorry am rambling on. I guess what am trying to say is that you matter. You're not alone. You've given me the courage to finally say something after being very quiet for months. 

TL;DR: You matter and your strength has given me the courage to finally speak. Even if it's no big deal to anyone else. I just want you to know you've made a difference in mine."

Be safe out there good people of reddit.

Edit: in haste I copied the wrong link. Having a bit of ""slow"" day. It's now linked to the correct post. Thanks for letting me know."

Truly a hero, that one."

And before you answer, I'm willing to learn at your feet.

Now we just have to play that ol game I recently heard of from the States. 

A nice drinking game touted by some ""50 something beer can swilling frat boy Supreme Court jJudge"". 

If I remember correctly,.... Devils 3some?

I may be misinformed..."

Wouldn't it be funny IF somehow science found that sucking a toe was a DYI vaccine of sorts?

Still blown away by your generosity and kindness in these difficult times. I really hope that any medical staffers suffering at the moment get to see your message and contact you.

Godspeed mate. Be safe. The world needs ya."

Definitely agree with you on Trump's friend. Am sure if you asked him for name, he'd say something to the effect of..

""Dow Jones? Great guy. One of the best. Some say I'm the one whose number one, but.. I guess you know your right? He's second. Am first!""

""If he was here, I'd give him a great introduction.""

**But I digress. Considering Trump used to call the media whilst pretending to be a publicist so he could brag about himself... it certainly isn't a stretch.**

This isn't an indictment on his leaks as some really showed us how fucked up many of our systems are... but this chap is really very unlikable."
