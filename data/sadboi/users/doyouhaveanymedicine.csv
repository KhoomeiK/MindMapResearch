I dont think you are hallucinating. Bipolar effects your perceptions and therefore things that treat it so aswell, I think thats all thats going on. Ive experienced similar things during med changes. Lamictal is also a particularly weird drug.   By far the most difficult drug to go on that ive ever tried in terms of the strange initial psycholgical effect and physical side effects. Give it 2-3 weeks after the target dose and you should notice things even out :)"

BipolarReddit,fij8w00,t1_fihljya,1582438123.0,"You need a mood stabiliser. Ill preface this by saying my BP is no where near that severe, but i have done stupid things like sleep with people overseas and put myself in dangerous situations. Always own your behaviour but try understand and feel the different state you're in when the worst of it is over and understand it for what it is. I prefer to look at my disorder like an influencer, it has sway over my actions, intentions and thoughts but it does not control me. I do lose sometimes and it shows in my behaviour, but its doesnt control, it influences and i try to build myself up further to where that same influence doesnt have the sane effect on me. I think the moment you give in and say its all the disorder (which i know you arent doing, but i have seen people do this) you lose your identity to the illness and essentially give up. Sometimes you lose the mental battle between deciphering what is you and what is the illness and your actions follow accordingly- although not at FAULT, you are responsible for them, and especially for what you do to amend the chaos you've created through those actions. Be stern with but do not attack yourself; after all your self is all you have in the fight against the disorder. So you want to be as pristine as you can be to combat it, in that sense self kindness works. Too much self kindess i think makes you lazy though so be careful. Think of it like this, in a boxing ring, if you get hit you dont punch yourself in the face in self retalliation foe getting hit- thats counterproductive. You take responsibility for it and say damn I let myself get hit how can i prevent it in the future; thats taking responsibility and holding yourself accountable for whats happened. Then you figure it out what happened, fix it and go again, and again and again until you start mastering it and start winning. Its hard and it takes ages and you take many hits but eventually you'll win the fight. Your self is your greatest weapon and defence against this disease. Build it up, strengthen it. Realising you need meds or different meds can be a correct move, nothing wrong with saying fuck i need help cant do this by myself, at the end of the day thats still you making steps to solve the problems. Do everything you can to better your condition and life. Get into a better psych. Start excersise. Try get sleep sorted. Create a schedule. Sort your friends out. All are incredibly complex problems that take immense effort and grit but its necessary. The result of not doing this is worse than the difficulty and stress of doing it. Good luck. 

Pro tip: get your supports in order, professional and or personal (psych, psychiatrist, family and make it apparent that you're dedicated to improving yourself and getting better, no one can or wants to help or support someone that isnt trying)"

Always report a rash to a doctor though, and if this psych doesnt believe you go to another GP or something to be safe.

Please tell someone, preferably someone close to you what you suspect is happening. Please take your medication if a moment of clarity comes about."

Once it was at my door it started speaking to me in latin or something. I could hear it plain as day but couldnt move. I had just started tapering off lamictal. Fucking terrifying experience."

I wanna take the attention to Tom for a minute, did you see his face when that video of Theo and Christina was playing? You cant fake that shit, Tom kept himself composed really well, but he was NOT happy when that was playing, and from there on. And Christina was trying desperately to explain what was happening. Fuck it was cringe worthy

I definitely think the beef was exaggerated to comedic level, but there was some real shit here"
