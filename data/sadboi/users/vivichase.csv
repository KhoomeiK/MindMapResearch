To me, he may have seemed ""excited"" and mentioned that bipolar disorder ran in his family too, as a way to make you feel better. It's true that bipolar is highly hereditary, so to have multiple instances of bipolar popping up in his family isn't surprising. If this is the case, I'm sure he's much more familiar with bipolar disorder than the general population. By ""bipolar is in \[my\] family too"" I think he means that several members of his family have diagnosed bipolar disorder. He's trying to make you feel better by normalizing it, given how hesitant you would've been about the disclosure and being judged.

It doesn't seem like he's trying to invalidate your struggles, nor does it immediately seem he has only a pop-culture understanding of it. I think his ""excitement"" is more related to him being keen to show you that he knows what bipolar disorder actually is, that he's okay with it, and that it's not a big deal for him and doesn't change the way he sees you. I'd definitely give him the benefit of the doubt. Or better yet, ask him directly?"

It may be wise for OP to emotionally prepare herself for CPS/social services getting involved and intervening. If OP's mental health has deteriorated so much that a suicide attempt has been made during pregnancy, it's unlikely she will be deemed a fit guardian at this time.

If the father files for custody of the baby he would have a very good chance of full custody. OP would get visitation rights, absolutely, especially given the child is a newborn. But if the father files, he would have an extremely strong case. It's possible OP may be awarded minority custody at first due to the fact that courts try to keep newborns and mothers together whenever possible. But this would likely require a provision that the father remains in the household to supervise interactions. As the infant gets older, this may transition over to full custody by the father if OP is still not stable.

If the father is willing to work with the OP to achieve stability, then yes, the infant will likely stay in the household. But if there is any sign of deterioration, CPS/social services would intervene immediately and at that point OP's chance of retaining equal custody is zero.

If the father is unwilling to work with OP, it is *very* understandable. **Ultimately, his wife has just attempted to kill herself and their unborn child.** I hope OP can really put herself in his shoes to understand his perspective, because his anger is completely justified."

I have a Bose QC35. It's really top of the line, and a lot of autistic people have this one, and for good reason. Hands down there is nothing else on the market that can achieve this level of noise-cancelling. They're expensive as hell but they're so worth it. They have significantly improved my quality of life.

Wakefield is responsible for the illness, disability, and death of hundreds of thousands of children both in the US and internationally.

Importantly, he has shaken public faith in the scientific institution.

I would consider the impact these headphones will have on your quality of life. I'm currently using the Bose QC35. It was expensive af and it really blew a dent in my budget. But this thing is absolutely top of the line and blocks out an incredible level of ambient noise. I could have 20 immediately adjacent enormous trucks speed by and be minimally stressed.

I would strongly suggest you wait and save up for a better pair of headphones. There is a rather significant difference in terms of noise-cancelling ability between low-end and high-end.

Short, insignificant comments or responses is all you need. For instance, if there seems to be a conversation starting in the kitchen, I'll head over and stand in the circle and listen.

For example, if I miss a joke with coworkers, I use a playfully skeptical ""uh huhhh"" with a raised eyebrow when they explain it to me. It makes it appear I understand the joke but am not very impressed (in a playful way), and people seem to find this sarcastic reaction very witty. They think I'm hilarious. The key to handling confusion in these sorts of social situations is to **make it look deliberate**.

Additionally, the autistic label is one I try not to reveal too casually. It colors the way your social behavior is received. Disclosure for me is a very strategic venture. If they had known I was autistic, they would not had interpreted my confusion as clever. They would have interpreted it as, like you said, weird and naive. Everyone has different comfort levels with disclosure. Personally, I find it rather uncomfortable and reserve it for situations where disclosure is absolutely necessary. How I am socially perceived matters a great deal to me.

In my experience, fewer words is better than more. The less you say, the more people automatically fill in the gaps in their own perception. Just find a way to play off your confusion. Ensure that it's understated, doesn't reveal that you don't understand, and will likely be interpreted as deliberate.

""How did you fall for that?"" also doesn't strike me as a malicious thing to say. In that context where you're in a positive social environment and somebody says this, it's probably playful rather than malicious. I certainly understand that you feel ""humiliated"", but it's quite unlikely this was the intention. Moreover, our interpretations and emotions doesn't always reflect reality."

I found an amazing daycare with a staff who is seriously obsessed and in love with dogs! They post pictures and videos on Instagram throughout the day. The dogs all seem so happy, and my floofer absolutely loves it. She's exposed to a large rotating set of dogs in a very safe environment with a staff that explicitly ensures only positive socializing experiences."

AskReddit,ffcl02n,t3_esr647,1579801696.0,"My current job.  I submit high quality work that I know other employees hired into this position could never achieve.  But it's mindnumbingly boring. The quality of my work is incredibly high because I'm so overqualified. But I don't have a lot of choices because I'm bipolar (and autistic, yay!)  and I find it difficult to hold down a full time job. Not with respect to quality of work, but with respect to showing up: a) at all, b) consistently, c) with reasonable mental stabilty required to perform tasks; and d) sober. I call in sick a lot because I'm either depressed AF or my brain is on fire and I'm seeing ants spilling out of my desk and smoke coming out from my fingers.

The even shittier part is that I'm already on a stable treatment regimen. This state I'm in currently is as good as it will ever be in my life. I have a full mental health team that follows me indefinitely (free, I'm Canadian) with optimized medication regimen and full psychosocial support (e.g. OTs, substance use counselors). But there is no cure for bipolar disorder. I'm simply not capable of working in the positions that I'm interested in. Especially because the careers I'm interested in all require advanced degrees. I was in a very competitive, full ride PhD program for two years, but ended up dropping out with many bridges burned because my mental illness just could not let me function as I needed to. So basically I'm stuck here. I'm completely unmotivated, apathetic, and spend most of my time on Reddit and staring through my screen. I want more in life but I'm just too tired."
