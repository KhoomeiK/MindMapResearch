The medications should definitely decrease the frequency of those thoughts, but I'm sure your aware they take time. Just keep being 100% transparent with your doctor and they will do everything in their power to stop these and if you don't notice any changes talk your doctor about lithium carbonate or other antidepressant additives if your not already taking it, note I am not a psychiatrist and this may not be the best for you just some advice. It honestly makes me very happy to hear that your getting help and your surrounded by people who truly understand and care about you. As of me, I'm a lot better than I was beforehand, but there major room for improvement thank you for asking:). Now I go around trying to help my friends and others get helps and treatment they need. Remember, if you ever need a private conversation or anything, that you can always dm me and I'll do my best to help!"

mentalhealth,f9zq7vq,t3_e7f9d7,1575744320.0,"I totally understand how you feel man. I am struggling with severe recurrent episodes of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and ADHD. I was actually recently admitted to a mental health hospital because of these thoughts. Basically these thoughts of suicide were always in my head no matter what time of day, I would wake up and it would already be talking to me, telling me how to kill myself. It was nonstop, no matter what I would do the thoughts NEVER left my head. I would be laying down and I would look up to see my lightbulb, and the thought would be to break the lightbulb and use the glass, I would go to my car and i would have thoughts of using my car etc, like it was constant 24/7. I would recommend talking to a psychiatrist and getting some medication. Trust me I know how hard it is to take that first step to get help but if you are having these thoughts then you need to talk to someone, you need to let someone know. If you need any advice on where to go or just want to talk more about your thoughts dont be afraid to dm me. I would be more than happy to talk and try to help you through this bc I know the pain your feeling, and nobody should have that pain."
