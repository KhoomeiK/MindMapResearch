askpsychology,fdi7ajn,t3_elamm0,1578437000.0,"My theory is that consciousness emerged as a result of socialization. As social beings we need to monitor what we say and do in our head , especially when we are going to face potential social rejection. 

When we perform tasks that don‚Äôt require socializing (e.g. writing a math exam), or in situations where we don‚Äôt anticipate social rejection or conflict (e.g. a child playing with mother) there is less self-consciousness or awareness of ones own thoughts or behaviors and we can enter a state of ‚Äúflow‚Äù.

Conversely when we are in situations where we are scrutinized by others or potentially face rejection or abandonment the need for self-consciousness is heightened.

Consciousness of internal feelings such as pain and happiness is necessary for us to be able to communicate with one another to exchange valuable information. Imagine if we are not conscious of our own internal feelings such pain or pleasure, how much more difficult would it be to communicate in social settings!

There are things that we are not conscious of, for example repressed trauma from childhood or socially unacceptable thoughts. Unawareness can hinder us from disclosure or growth in such cases.

I think consciousness evolved out of social need, but then this inward eye, combined with the ability for language, allowed us to reason through things in a much more complex way than the purpose that it was originally evolved for."
