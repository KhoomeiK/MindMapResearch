There is also documentation of lionesses taking charge of packs of lions in the absence of makes, even gaining higher t and growing manes.

But outside of physical transition in nature, there are also animals who behave as the other gender. Birds apparently do it often.

As far as human transgenderism, it's not a recent thing. Similar to how I'm willing to provide you studies, I'm also willing to discuss trans history. You can find trans people all throughout history.

I'm happy to have a discussion for the pure intent of learning your perspective to. This far you've been respectful despite our differing opinions which is rare. Good on you.

Kardashian? Definitely. I don't get it but yes she has millions of fans. I actually think cosmetic surgery is fine though. I kinda feel like it's your body and you should do what you want with it. I'm also a posthumanist/transhumanist though, so our views on this likely differ. I think some people take cosmetic surgery way to far. But in general I think it's cool science has gotten us to this point. Lots of cosmetic surgery does a lot of good. I have a deviated septum for example, which has gotten worse over the years. My cartilage can literally be seen if you look up my nostril. I'm very much looking forward to fixing it as it's very frustrating and I can only really breathe from one nostril. I don't need any surgery, I can breathe just fine, but I think it'd feel much better to have a straight nose. Some cosmetic surgery is good.

Claiming it is a mental health condition, on the other hand, is the oldest trick in the book. Before LGBT people were mentally ill, it was women, before that, athiests.

Second, although i agree agree a lot of mtfs do not pass, many others do. Your claim is a show of pure ignorance, it tells me you've not done your homework. What of Blair White? Indya Moore?

Lots of humans in today's society take meds for a variety of issues. If trans people having to take meds to deal with dysphoria is bad, so is any lifelong medication. I feel the same way about trans surgery. People get cosmetic surgery for all sorts of reasons and nobody bats an eye. Look at the extreme bodymod people, they have legit issues and nobody gives a fuck. Trans people getting surgery to feel more comfortable in their bodies is for some reason where we draw the line though, because it's not natural? I don't follow this logic you've presented. Furthermore I don't think you know as much as you think you do. The fact you had to name drop your mom's qualifications instead of your own I feel speaks to that, so does the fact I'm hearing bthe same anti trans propaganda from you that I've heard a hundred other times.

I disagree that trans people have ""corrupted"" identities. Corrupt in what way?  The trans people I've spoken too are kind hearted caring people. When I was homeless a trans woman and her wife put me up for a month while I saved for a security deposit. I just refuse to see trans people as useless because they don't reproduce as much.

dankmemes,f1cb14t,t1_f1ca167,1569353816.0,"Homosexuality was also widely considered a mental disorder. Literally so was being a woman at one point. Definitions change as our understanding grows.

A disorder implies it causes you to have difficulty functioning. Trans people are perfectly capable of being contributing members of society. Anecdotally, I participate in the work force, pay taxes, all of that. Other issues related with being trans mostly come from society. If society was fully accepting of trans people, the mental health of trans people would be much better. There are a litany of studies which show trans people tend to excel in accepting environments.

You can argue it's a disorder in that trans people don't reproduce or whatever, but even that's not true. Not true of gay people either. But even of trans people weren't having kids, there is an argument to be made that LGBT people are a result of evolutionary pressure and exist to help raise the children of others in the ""tribe"".

>It just goes against the natural order of things. Just fucking own it. Don't act like it's normal. You know what else is unnatural? Surgery. But we do that all the time. I would have been dead at 20 if I didn't have surgery... it still violates the natural order. 

I do own it. Yes surgery is unnatural, but so is ALL surgery. Have a open bypass to correct a clogged valve? You should just die, because NATURE. See how dumb this argument is? We aren't animals, we aren't in nature, if surgery increases the quality of peoples lives what is your problem? 

>And all that aside, it seems as though you must be delusional to miss the point that it is not how the human organism is intended to function. Even if only the reproduction. Granted at this point in history that's not exactly important.

I went point by point through your arguments. You clearly didn't even check my sources. Kinda hypocritical and low effort. It's becoming more and more clear you are rooted in your views and that this is a waste of time. Nonetheless:

>And no it's no koolaid. 

It's total kool aid :)

>It's the natural order of things. You're born, you live, procreate and die. That is, in its most basic form the purpose of your existence. Anything that interferes with that is a problem. 

I've addressed this argument like 6 times now. Boring. Do some research instead of regurgitating the same stuff over and over.

 >And like I've said- I could really not care less if you are trans, gay, etc. My complaint is that you people are making such a simple issue so fucking complicated. 

We are not the ones making this complicated. We know exactly what we need, what treatment works, ect. It's people like you who say dumb misinformed stuff that make this complicated. Did we want the gay marriage debate? fuck no, we wanted to get married. People like you forced us into that shit. We just want to live our lives. 

>Just admit you ain't right, do your thing and get on with it.

Seriously? I'm going to do my thing anyway, but if I was ""wrong"" I wouldn't be doing any of this/ Do you know what dysphoria feels like? It's horrible. At the start of this you mention you have mental issues of your own. Can you imagine if you had people saying your specific condition wasn't real, and that you shouldn't get meds, and that you're unnatural and all this other crap? No other mental health condition is so drenched in debate, it's so freaking frustrating. I just want treatment. Every last shred of evidence supports that trans people are valid and that transition treats dysphoria better than anything else. 

You should admit you are wrong and just admit this is personal bias, not one based in science. I've supported all my arguments, you've supported none of your while rambling on about science and trans people not being able to reproduce

>Still, these practices are unnatural. 

There is tons of homosexuality in nature. You can say its unnatural all you want, science does not support your perspective.

Look, I appreciate you are trying to have the ""its bad and wrong but do it anyways approach"" but honestly you are so wrong about everything it's pretty frustrating on my end. Don't claim your side is backed by science when all the science shows you are conclusively wrong"
2meirl4meirl,eyjdato,t1_eyikiqd,1567117044.0,">Lemme ask this- why do you feel the need to so thoroughly defend yourself?

Same reason anyone defends any perspective? 

>It would SEEM to indicate that you are uncertain of your stance on the subject. 

This is perhaps your most silly statement yet. I'm not sure where you got this impression. I'm willing to change my mind in the face of evidence, you have yet to provide one shread of evidence backing your claims. 

Additionally, I feel you are projecting. You've used the same points multiple times now, the conversation isnt advancing because you cannot come up with new points.

>But you do feel like you need to defend yourself. To some random internet asshole. Why are you so self conscious? Just own it and get on with life. You might find you'll be much happier without worrying about how others see you

You're misunderstanding me. I don't feel like I am ""defending"" anything. Most of the time I don't interact with people who are anti-trans, but you seem like an intelligent person who may be convinced. This is an attempt ad education, much more than me defending myself.

Additionally, I don't think you are a random asshole. You are a human being, same as I. It's easy to forget that online."
2meirl4meirl,eyhv40u,t1_eyh75vg,1567093178.0,">That has a deleterious effect on the normal function of the human body...

It doesn't, if you can provide any sort of evidence supporting this statement I'd appriciate it. I'm trans and I have a perfect bill of health. Transition actually allowed me to lose 100 pounds and quit smoking. Anecdotally, transition has had the opposite effect for me. My health has drastically improved. 

>Yeah, that's a disorder. In what other situation would that not be called a psychological(or whatever system is affected) disorder? 

A disorder is defined by making people unable to operate. Trans people are perfectly capable of leading normal, healthy lives. The reason trans people deal with suicidal idealization is society, not the actual condition. 

The organization responsible for defining what is and is not a psychiatric disorder, the American Psychiatric Association, has this to say about the matter (via the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version 5 (DSM-5 in short, I'll only use the abbreviated form from here on out):

""DSM-5 aims to avoid stigma and ensure clinical care for individuals who see and feel themselves to be a different gender than their assigned gender. It replaces the diagnostic name ""Gender Identity Disorder"" with ""Gender Dysphoria"", as well as makes other important clarifications in the criteria. It is important to note that gender non-conformity is not in itself a mental disorder. The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.""

In short, the people who literally wrote the definition of mentally disordered, 100% reject the notion that being transgender means being mentally disordered.

>You require exogenous hormones(endocrine dysfunction), surgical operation(physical abnormality requiring surgical correction, that's a deformity), and if those are too offensive... you can't reproduce. That's the prime biological directive of life. 

We do not require hormones. Many of us choose to pursue hormone treatment for the numerous mental health benefits provided too us. If you see life as merely our base instincts, why don't you move to the jungle and forage for food? We are intelligent human being who can find other meaning in life. There is a lot of evidence which suggests all LGBT people [are natural mutations designed to help the tribe survive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Khn_z9FPmU). I may never have my own children, but I'm a prime candidate to adopt children in need. 

>and if those are too offensive... you can't reproduce.

Can you stop assuming I'm a triggered SJW? I'm trying to have a discussion here, I've been hearing the ""and since you're so offended"" shit for so many years now.... It's tiring. I'm not offended, trust me, I've heard far worse from people I care far more about. Don't flatter yourself. I'm not offended.

>Like I said before, I have nothing against trans.

I kinda feel like you do, but ok. 

> If you wanna chop off your penis fine. You don't want to conform to the normal accepted gender roles, that's fine too.

cool

>But don't dare try to convince me that you are a ""woman trapped in a man's body"". What if I told you I'm a goat trapped in a man's body? Say I were to tell you I sexually identify as an apple? Where is the line? When can we say something is wrong?

Don't dare? Lol. I can say what I want, deal with it, snowflake. 

For real though, you examples here are slippery slope fallacy. When the gay marriage debate was still a thing, conservatives tried to frame it as ""men can marry men? What next, people marrying ducks?"". This is the same idiot propaganda with a different flavor, and you've eaten it up. You can say anything is wrong if you want. That's freedom of speech. Me calling you out on poorly researched views and slippery slope fallacies is also freedom of speech.

I can provide mountains of evidence that trans people are physically neurologically the gender they identify as. Or you can sling the same 15 year old conservative talking points at me. You know they used to say gay people were mentally ill? Read about Alan Turing, man who cracked the nazi enigma code and was then castrated for being mentally ill. Again, the kool aid you have drank with regard to the trans issue is the same. 

Please don't justify your backwards opinions on trans people as being scientific or whatever. Your opinion actually has 0 basis in the realm of fact and is entirely based on your negative emotions toward trans people. That's fine, but don't be dishonest about it. Please save me the same old arguments in your next reply. It's not long now before you call me an attack helicopter lol"
2meirl4meirl,eyfshdd,t1_eyfqaag,1567054197.0,">Yes, and...I mean this in the least asshole way possible, but- so are schizophrenics.

Not really. One is a physical neurological pre-natal condition, schizophrenia is genetic and can also be late onset. I could literally write a paragraph about why these conditions are 100% not scientifically analogous. Also, this is an aside, but if you have to start anything with ""I'm not an asshole"", you're probably being an asshole :x

>Fuck this century, fucking political correctness we can't call a spade a spade because it might offend someone. That's not the world I grew up in. 

It's not about being offensive, or political correctness, it's about using the correct scientific term. There is also a lot of research which suggests using pronouns literally keeps trans people from killing themselves. Please don't feign sympathy for trans people then refuse to help them because ""political correctness"". Again, it's nothing to do wit politics. 

And no, I am not being ""triggered"" I'm trying to support my side. 

People were always offended, the world you are remembering growing up in is tinted by rose colored glasses. 

>We treat everyone with kid gloves their whole life then we wonder why people break under the slightest stress.

What? I feel like it's the opposite. People are a lot more hardy these days than they ever were. We're more aware and more opinionated, sure, but have you seen how fragile the boomer generation is? You can't eat avocado without triggering an old person. We've become far better at living with diverse groups. Before the mere sight of a black person in some parts of the country could set off all sorts of shit, yet today we are more offended? I don't see it. The only offended people I encounter in my day to day are people who are offended that I, a trans person, dare to exist. You wanna talk about PC shit and people getting offended? Boy do I have some stories for you. 

>When I was a kid, they let us know when/ how we were fucking up. Shit would be considered abuse now. But we didn't have weekly school shootings, because we knew how to deal with stress. The world is going to hell.

Lets go point by point here:

* They still tell kids when they are fucking up. In fact, it was helicopter parenting and telling kids they are fucking up all the time which caused the anxiety you are seeing in the youngest generations 

>Shit would be considered abuse now. 

* I can link you 100 studies that physical and emotional abuse are not good for children. Just because you had a shitty childhood and turned out ok, doesn't mean this is the best approach. If your main worry is anxious, stressed kids, being hard on kids is not a fix. Anecdotally, I was abused as a kid, it did not help me. Hell, if you think being trans is a bad thing, you should be 100% against the rough treatment of kids, as such abuse is more common in trans people 

*  But we didn't have weekly school shootings, because we knew how to deal with stress. 

This is a totally different debate. I'm willing to have it but its another topic 100%

*  The world is going to hell.

I felt and still feel this way sometimes. If there was one thing I had to say on that subject: People have been saying the world is going to hell for hundreds, no THOUSANDS of years. Chances are it's not, and in a way your narcissistic to think the world will end in your lifetime. Humanity will march forward. You may not like the direction it's going in, but humanity will go forward. 

I get these are just words, it sounds like you may be having a rough time, but shit gets better

The basic premise is that yes, your body (sex) is routed in biology. your mind (gender) can be independent of that. A lot of research suggests it is a pre-natal hormonal based condition, and that a large % of trans people have actual physical brain neurology in line with the gender they identify as. I can totally send you some studies. Point is there is a physical aspect at play, trans people are biologically different from cis people."

I know that's not the popular opinion on reddit, I understand there are a lot of reasons things can be reposted, reddits search feature sucks. 

It's not so much about the amount of time although 100% it is a factor. In this specific instance, it's particularly egregious not because it's just a repost. It's a repost of front page content from barely 2 weeks ago. If it was a repost of a top post from 3-4 months ago? Whatever. If it was a repost of something good that didn't get a lot of attention, then 2 weeks is more OK.

But again I think reposting at all is kinda shit."

It's hardly a threat.
