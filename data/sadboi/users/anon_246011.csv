lolgrindr,eyguwzt,t1_eygunun,1567077073.0,"it's quite unfortunate really, now girls are getting so desperate they have to go on a gay dating app to find a boyfriend, it really shows how our society has failed heteros"
lolgrindr,eygufdb,t1_eygu8tj,1567076839.0,w-what? that's not how gay men are? I can't turn them straight and get them to fuck me :( waaaaaaaa
lolgrindr,eygu5ut,t1_eygttal,1567076707.0,the women are so hot they're going to 'turn' all the gays straight. (no joke Ive heard a girl talk like this before)
lolgrindr,eygtydi,t1_eygtjse,1567076596.0,the poor straights need more apps because they have trouble connecting with eachother

askgaybros,evv40pc,t1_evs1qyn,1564818306.0,I have tried beyond blue and not had a good experience there. Qlife didn't help much because their sessions are so short. I'm currently going to headspace but it doesn't seem to help.
