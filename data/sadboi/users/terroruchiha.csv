Fireteams,f2epryz,t1_f2eh5i2,1570201415.0,that is not the intent. i am not sure why you felt the need to say that as it is an assumption.
Fireteams,f2e2wr3,t1_f2dsbt6,1570177482.0,"of course, you can. the link is in the profile on Bungie."
Fireteams,f2cnvnc,t1_f2cdhhk,1570140348.0,something is going on with Bungie. my apologies about that.

i am very sorry for the loss of your friend. may you heal well and swiftly."
Stutter,eyl8y33,t1_eyjsq3t,1567178968.0,i just noticed this. thank you for sparing time to cross-post this. i never would have expected anyone to care that much. i really appreciate it \[:

Fireteams,eyjuqzp,t1_eyjtn0l,1567128787.0,"again, there is a time and a place for everything. you and your friends are notorious for not being able to tell the difference. let us not negate the fact that you and your friends instigated harassment against me with the main perpetrator. why does it bother you that you were kicked? you left the clan prior to. i am positive your friends would have followed. the biggest question i have is, why do you think you would have been allowed to stay after that nonsense? i will not lay down and be bullied by several persons. if you were just voicing your opinions then that would be different, but that was not that. it did not work out with you and your posse for a very obvious reason. you have your own clan now, so what benefit do you have to reply here? to make me look bad? there is no lie in this post. so, keep it moving and enjoy your day or night. thank you."
Fireteams,eyjorpm,t1_eyjoh4s,1567124226.0,thank you!
Fireteams,eyjkwpa,t1_eyjkg49,1567121506.0,activity is not an issue if you would have no issue in informing me about periods in which you would be idle or if you are just generally someone who plays minimally etc.

Fireteams,eyjdkcl,t1_eyjc7q4,1567117187.0,what would be a pain? trying to be patient or other’s being mindful?
Fireteams,eyjax23,t1_eyj7j4g,1567115626.0,"the requiring of patience is for those able to control that factor. if one has a condition or disorder that which prohibits them from doing so, then simply informing me or the general (if comfortable) would suffice. it should be no problem, for the group, accepting those who may struggle with expression and i would ask that everyone be open minded."
Fireteams,eyj1pmn,t1_eyj0cdl,1567111003.0,"thank you, but you may feel differently if you have not read carefully and in full. i am not accepting members of the clan as of now. this post is for the joining of the server on discord."

depression,ewv0w3h,t3_cpvwhh,1565796173.0,"yes, because it makes it feel like my issues are not valid. that no one would believe nor accept that fact that i am not well. 

i also feel like garbage when i have days that i cannot do anything, which has been increasing lately. imagine feeling guilty for being unproductive when you have a valid reason for it, but then you are high functioning so it is really an excuse?"
anime,evqzpo8,t1_evqzioj,1564699598.0,you would be correct. thank you very much.

i wish i could offer you a place to live. you cannot live there. do you need any money?"

Naruto,erkqoxj,t1_erkjh3c,1560969291.0,"Naruto was going to live due to plot no matter which way it was written. the plot that he was to inherit the powers and abilities of The Sage of Six Paths. so, how exactly did Sakura do anything? that was placed into the story just for the sake of it. just like her punching Kaguya Otsutsuki downward to “help” Naruto and Sasuke seal her was just for the sake of including her."
Naruto,erkgibe,t1_erjhrs5,1560962955.0,what is this fallacy? she did not keep Naruto alive. Hagaromo did.

findfashion,ept4nrw,t1_ept43x8,1559481518.0,i did not even think about the fact that this could be customized. i wanted exactly how it is as pictured but oh well. do you see how much space there is between the potential “little” and “black”? the space between “black” and “dress” is much smaller. thank you for your search.
