I'm so glad I did my research before I had my son and chose not to circumcise him. My husband initially wanted him circumcised but after I explained why I was against he supported the decision. I wish parents would do the work rather than just doing what everyone else does."
AskReddit,f9rybw4,t1_f9rwgsr,1575583016.0,I was thinking it and you said it. Both are wrong and unnecessary procedures. Can we just quit cutting children's genitals unless it is medically necessary? Why does that even need to be said.

Hang in there. You'll love them by this time next year. I promise."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,f9gtozc,t1_f9gtalf,1575304593.0,"I could not agree more! My step son is trans so it is incredibly important to me to support organizations that include transgender kids.

The only part that bothered me is that it is up to the troop or local community to make the decision of including a transgender child. I feel like that still leaves room for discrimination in very conservative areas but they are still headed in the right direction."
WitchesVsPatriarchy,f9gr5h9,t1_f9gm6o5,1575303537.0,"I looked up the same.

They do, however, take transgender girls into troops. On a case-by-case basis but I am still willing to shovel them my money for it. Girl scouts has certainly changed since I got kicked out of my troop as a kid."
tarantulas,f98ixxy,t1_f98idhk,1575178870.0,"I usually stick to about once a week. When that bald spot turns black or nearly so, offer food but remove any.uneaten quickly. When she starts to refuse food, let her be until she had molted.

After her molt, do not attempt to feed until after her fangs have hardened up. They'll turn from a white color to black. Same as before a molt, if food is refused remove it quickly. Usually a week to two weeks after a molt is a good time frame.

Hope that helps!

Edit:  Just wanted to mention, the larger the T the more time it will take for them to harden up. A week to two weeks is just a guideline. Some can take a month if they are quite big."
tarantulas,f98i7br,t3_e4bboo,1575178612.0,"When that bald spot starts to turn dark, it is about ready to molt.  Make sure to slow down on feeding around then and leave no unattended crickets.  They can harm a molting tarantula if left inside. 

What a cute little spider! 💖"
AskReddit,f95piex,t1_f94yvnu,1575132765.0,"I know that Boston (??) I think, chased them out. Massachusetts was.one.of the first places to legalize gay marriage so they weren't having their homophobia. I might be wrong on which city it was though.

It's too bad that people's lack of knowledge on sexuality turns them into hateful, spiteful people who don't want the LGBTQ to have rights."

I can't even. Are people really this dumb?"
