Top right is 33 days ago when I last posted him on here and left is today, sitting as close to the window as he can be without being in his sunny on the floor spot. I just watered him yesterday, I usually do it every ~2 weeks, sometimes less if he’s looking too thirsty. 
For the most part I’ve been playing musical plant to get him to where he is now, shorter with more growth. Putting him on the patio simply isn’t an option, but he seems alright given the circumstances."

I have been doing every 1-1 1/2 weeks like 75 percent changes. I know I shouldn’t trust PetSmart, but the one I go to now has one fish guy who really knows his stuff about Bettas. I was talking to another employee and he ran in to help out. Now, he’s not the one who tested the water, so I have a feeling that has something to do with why I was told the ammonia levels were fine.

Also, do you think his new snail could be stressing him out or anything? They don’t interact at all that I see, the snail will literally push past Peach.

I don’t own the API kit, just some test strips for 2 kinda of hardness, pH, nitrates and Nitrites. I can bring a sample to PetSmart and again and have them test for free again though."
bettafish,f8bjs6g,t3_e02uju,1574438530.0,"Hey everyone! Peach is somewhere around a year and a half old (he was a man when I got him) and has recently been acting a little weird. Normally he swims around his tank or sits on his leaf hammock but lately he’s been hanging out more and more where he is in the photo, in the back corner under the filter. He has red on his gills which I tried to get in the photo. He was breathing when I took that, they’re not always out that far. 

His Nitrates and Nitrites are both at zero, Ph is floating around 7.5, I don’t have anything to test ammonia at my house but PetSmart said it “wasn’t abnormal”. I initially went to PetSmart to but him a snail and ask a worker about Peach who told me to try Melafix for a bacterial infection.

His last dose was on Sunday and 25 percent water change the day after. He really doesn’t look much different nor is he acting different. Am I overreacting? Should I try more Melafix?
