podcasts,ew3rn60,t3_cmkunj,1565092572.0,"I think that when podcasts are recorded in front of a live audience ( such as the Guilty Feminist) having a video element would and is great. I also think that when podcasts involve a conversation that is between more than 2 people, its advantageous to have a video element because it shows the nuances in the conversation better than audio only can."
podcasts,ew3re4u,t3_cm53hk,1565092317.0,"Its a very open-ended question, like asking what movie you would recommend over all others, but I do think that Tim Ferriss is amazing for long form conversation and doing deep dives into various topics. I also love Dax Sheapard's ""Armchair Expert"".  Joe Rogan is excellent because you can explore complex topics in an accessible way. Joe's chauvinistic style sometimes annoys me but his podcast guests are top notch and the video element of being able to watch the conversation adds value."
podcasts,eupseit,t3_cdig4w,1563963490.0,Thank you! I come here every week to check out new podcasts. Such a candid way to create dialogue around good podcasts. Thanks moderators:)
podcasts,euprnw6,t3_cgp6vh,1563962897.0,"I think a good podcast should make you feel like you're in the room and almost part of the conversation. Expanding that conversation ( no matter how good the content) to hundreds of people feels a lot less inclusive. I also think that the dynamic of the conversation changes because with a large audience comes the need to perform and exaggerate and risks diluting the conversation itself. There are some podcasts where I think it works in spades, The Guilty Feminist podcast for example started and continues to be recorded in front of a live audience, but the host and guests are comedians, so the format demands an audience. With others however, especially long-form conversations like Sam Harris or Tim Ferriss, I feel that the addition of a live audience dilutes the content for the listener."
EatingDisorders,esguwal,t3_c7k9lt,1561968127.0,"Once your body has gone through an extended period of calorie restriction or starvation, it's normal for you to want to consume everything in sight - hungry or not. It's the body's way of having adjusted to a mentality of scarcity and not knowing when and if you're going to get your next meal. It can take quite a while for this feeling to go away but there are behavioral eating patterns that will help so talking to a professional counselor or dietitian would be a good idea.  


I've personally recovered from an eating disorder that involved a lot of binge eating and struggled with similiar eating patterns to what you've described. Initially what helped was eating several small meals a day on a schedule, not allowing my body to become too hungry ever and also getting enough sleep. It's routine and boring but after several months it very much regulated my appetite and metabolism and I was able to go back to eating with more flexibility, enjoying social meals out with friends and having the ability to indulge without too much guilt.  


Today I actually follow a modified intermittent fasting diet where I only eat 2 meals a day but I also haven't had a relapse in 5 years so it felt like a safe time to try something that my body intuitively gravitated towards anyway and it seems to satisfy my need to indulge a bit more in the evenings, which is something I missed doing the ""3 meals a day"" kind of model which doesn't work for everyone.   


Anyway, given the worry, anxiety, and fear you have around whether or not you're binging should be signal enough that you should try a different model of eating patterns. When you're giving your body what it needs, these feelings start to decrease, not increase, so it would be my advice to talk to a professional who's advice you're willing to trust and really take a risk on trying something new."
EatingDisorders,es8v0uk,t3_c6eea5,1561716295.0,"Whether you have a mild eating disorder or a severe one ( which in the course of recovery can vary greatly in terms of your day to day behavior) - the issue is that you've recognized there's a problem and have sought professional help. Nothing but good can come of that and you have no need to feel guilt or shame about it, although this is very common as well. As eating disorders are about your mental health as much as the behavior around food that surrounds them, I think you've definitely taken the right steps forward."
EatingDisorders,equsiqe,t3_bzl8k8,1560334815.0,"I think that it's important to tell your family if you feel that your relationship with your parents is a healthy and open one. If your parents are able to help to support your recovery financially and with emotional support, a lot of the shame or pressure you feel will be lifted. On the other hand, I think that if your parents have no familiarity with ED's in general that its important that they have some basic resources and understanding on the topic in order to be able to give you the support you need. Because a lot of the behaviors around ED's are hidden, parents might not know what they can actually say or do in a practical sense that will help - some essential knowledge is really important, so perhaps giving them a book or some articles they can read in addition to telling them will be really useful. It's great that you've taken the steps you already have to speak with a professional."
EatingDisorders,epgmigx,t3_bts1ji,1559215532.0,"I would recommend getting him an appointment with a therapist. Sometimes a 3rd-party who is objective and professional will help shed light on a problem he might not understand well himself. It's easy to be triggered by your partner's eating habits. I suffered through over 15 years of anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder and even though I would consider myself to be 90% recovered, I find it difficult when my husband - a personal trainer and bodybuilder - goes on a calorie restricted or extreme diet for any period of time. One thing that has helped me a lot is listening to body positivity podcasts and reading similar literature. There is a really educational and proactive community out there that keeps recovered ED women in a healthy condition."
rarepuppers,ep6ou5i,t3_bu1pd6,1559071757.0,Did you find out the breed? He's a stunner. Gorgeous color. Looks like he might have a bit of Daschund in him.
EatingDisorders,ep6n2zg,t3_bts0ve,1559071133.0,"I think there are certain fitness cultures that cultivate, tolerate, and disguise EDs very well and naturally people that have an unhealthy relationship with their bodies often gravitate towards these sports, whether it be bodybuilding, dance, figure skating, long-distance running or otherwise.  


On the flipside, there are some sports that lend themselves much more to body positivity and or welcome a wider range of body types. Yoga and triathlon come to mind as being a couple. I think in these contexts tracking your personal progress or achievement on social media is more about performance and fueling rather than examining the aesthetics of a specific body part or obsessing over macro-nutrients.  


I think that the divide between recreation and competitive also plays a role in hiding ED's. Competitive strains of any sport help to justify extreme eating behaviors and regimes much more than recreational ones."
