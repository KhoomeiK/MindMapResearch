It looks like alot of this stuff looks like it comes from those subscription boxes and are designed just for one time use. You obviously live in a colder climate or at least I'm assuming due to the snow shoes and goggles. You need a shelter and sleeping bag rated for it. Also, get a cooker. A jet boil, MSI, or hell a sterno. If it's so cold outside you can still cook inside of a shelter. Just be careful about it. Downsize your fishing tackle. Read up on things like trot lines and fish snares. I wouldn't worry about the rod. Ditch that hatchet and shovel. Get a quality e tool if you want one and a quality hatchet. I'd suggest a nice larger fixed blade knife. It would be better for things like setting snares. I love that you have a medical kit. Just make sure its stocked with alot of good quality things. Rather than just some bandaids and ointment. Some more water storage like a good water bottle and a pot to cook in. You're on your way though.
