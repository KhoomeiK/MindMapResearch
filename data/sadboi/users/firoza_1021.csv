PCOS,fmj54q7,t1_fmiy1ni,1586123223.0,"Struggles with weight, insulin resistance, hirsutism (that didn‚Äôt go away but I can maintain it without anyone noticing) no periods, two miscarriages, fatigue, bad skin. I went to an endocrinologist to do a full blood work up a year ago and compared it to bloodwork I did three weeks ago, nothing too high anymore, and carrying a healthy pregnancy which was conceived naturally and on accident haha! (And this is even after 2 failed rounds of clomid)"
PCOS,fmhy6xr,t3_fvd75y,1586097412.0,"Do it!! It works! I COMPLETELY reversed mine. I didn‚Äôt try to get too obsessed with fasting, calorie count, carbs. I just ate what I knew was good for me, made my largest meal breakfast and stopped eating after 8pm. I don‚Äôt go over 100 carbs a day. Usually keep it around 80. I added 30 min walks every couple days. Lost 70 lbs and got pregnant within a year!"
pregnant,flbgar6,t3_fnpqt1,1585004034.0,I‚Äôm 6 weeks (had a scan today) and feeling the same as you :/ also unplanned and don‚Äôt have good emotional support from the father at this time. He is still grasping the reality of a baby coming :/ PLUS I live two hours from him. (Planning to move in a few months to where he is but I have no clue how Covid19 will affect that as we both were laid off due to the virus)
pregnant,fl1ocdv,t1_fl1kd2o,1584732975.0,"He has expressed I‚Äôm ruining his life, he will hold it against me, and that it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot living at all.‚Äù So it‚Äôs been scary to cope without the emotional support. So I do understand your disdain, he doesn‚Äôt even want to see pictures or hear about the dr visits :("
pregnant,fl10r46,t3_fj9wov,1584719729.0,I‚Äôm in a position where I totally want this baby (7 weeks rn) but my SO of 3 years is INSISTING on abortion but does say that it‚Äôs my choice in the end and that he will support me and baby if I do keep it. He‚Äôs been hateful and terrified and crying. But I can‚Äôt see myself aborting.. everyone else including SO‚Äôs parents are very supportive of me keeping the baby. I understand your struggle. I still haven‚Äôt given my SO a for sure answer on my choice but I know what my heart is telling me.
pregnant,fl0xm3n,t3_fktike,1584717900.0,"My mom had 4 c-sections! Her second incision actually  became infected quickly and completely opened up while leaving the hospital. Due to infection they couldn‚Äôt close it up and she had to heal from the inside out over a few weeks. It was hell for her but despite that she did still have two more c sections! With her fourth (at age 40 when I was 16) they removed a chunk of scare tissue during the procedure which gave her essentially a bit of a nip and tuck haha! Besides that one issue with the second c-section, all was well with her for the other two."
pregnant,fl0vaw2,t3_fl6iza,1584716503.0,That‚Äôs normal! In a few weeks I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see a little bebe in there :)
PCOS,fkty6xe,t3_fkfjxl,1584537849.0,"100% diet! Low or no sugar. 5 low carb days a week, healthy fats. I lost 50 pounds, got my period back, and got pregnant :o"
PCOS,fknbhmm,t1_fkmthhc,1584361004.0,So I actually wasn‚Äôt trying at all :o I have been eating very healthy for a year now and dropped from 200 lbs to 134 so that‚Äôs the biggest thing. I went from not having had a period in a year to having perfectly regular periods. But I had still been told I‚Äôd need clomid and other medications so it feels surreal that I‚Äôm here now!

alpharetta,fjxe4cc,t3_fevnve,1583669707.0,Honestly Yummy Sushi in Crabapple is really good for such a small place. And the people are really good. I recommend the crazy tuna roll.
PCOS,fjd0if6,t1_fjc3jmz,1583242543.0,"I completely cut soda out. When I drink fruit juice it‚Äôs diluted in water, instead of soda I get these low carb drinks called Bai. I don‚Äôt eat bread or pasta at all. I always start with a big healthy breakfast, and I don‚Äôt eat anything starting 2 hours before bed time. It‚Äôs seriously all about the sugars and carbs. But I‚Äôve found I can still eat a lot of things even when counting carbs. I also ALWAYS have a cheat day, otherwise I couldn‚Äôt stick with the grand scheme of it all! I also used to binge eat but now I portion control. Oh and I don‚Äôt eat fast food at all unless it‚Äôs grilled nuggets from chick fil a with a fruit cup and diet lemonade. 

I want to note that everyone‚Äôs body is different, it may take longer for some, or others way have certain dietary needs unlike me! But maybe start like me and just address one bad eating habit first. For me it was soda. Maybe for someone else it‚Äôs candy bars, or chips. Small incremental change is how I did it :)"
PCOS,fjc2jf1,t3_fclmue,1583206967.0,Good job! I too went from 200 to 134 and it‚Äôs been a full year now since beginning that journey! (And that was with no working out!!) It‚Äôs definitely possible!

It was like I suddenly unlocked the memory by directly forcing it out."
BPD,f7bomdn,t3_dv7zrx,1573574077.0,Thankfully I don‚Äôt go through this type of thing with text. I had an ex that DEMANDED I text him every 2 minutes. And if I couldn‚Äôt then it was hell to pay. So I‚Äôve been able to drop those expectations since I absolutely hated them for myself as well. But in high school this was me :(
