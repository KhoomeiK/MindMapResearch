mentalhealth,fqorgks,t3_gjlgur,1589522695.0,I feel this way so often. I once wrote it out on reddit but then I thought I don't make sense and deleted. I have not felt home in years. It's only home when I'm alone with my mom. And that has not happened in years. It's not even my sister's fault but she brings up 15 year old stuff and they have fight. It feels like running away. But as I said it's not her fault cuz she's schezophrenic.
