insomnia,fjhsvy1,t1_fjh4b62,1583354451.0,"In no particular order.
1.	No more watching TV in bed. Even though I've done it since I was a teenager, I realize now that it can be a big distraction when having trouble sleeping.
2.	No more reading in bed. I sometimes break this rule but try to stick with the old adage about bedrooms only being for two things: sleeping and sexy time. Instead of lying in bed reading for an hour or two before bedtime, I will read on the couch in the living room. When I start feeling myself get tired, I put the book down and go into the bedroom without turning on the light or anything.
3.	Replace watching TV with music/guided meditation/sleep stories. I have mild tinnitus and cannot handle being in a completely silent room. Youtube has a ton of 8+ hour videos with relaxing instrumental music and nature sounds, many of which will go to a black screen after a few minutes so as to produce less light. I usually pick one of these at bedtime for some background noise. I also keep my air purifier on for a light fan noise. And often I will use my Calm app on my phone and listen to a guided meditation or a sleep story, which usually last anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes depending on which you pick. Audio books are always good too. Here's my sleep playlist from YouTube if you want some examples. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXb5MHXHqfXw9xxam_R9WFqVTG_65Zidh
4.	Don't go to bed early. It's important for the body and brain to be in a good circadian rhythm. We're often tempted after a crappy night of sleep to go to bed early the next night to ""catch up."" For me at least, this plan rarely works. More often I end up sitting in bed an extra hour or more wishing for sleepiness but feeling wide awake. It's better to stay up and mildly active until your regular bedtime, or even a little later if you still feel awake and alert.
5.	Put the phone or computer away at least an hour before bedtime. I find that whenever I break this rule and fart around on my phone when I should be trying to sleep, my brain has a much harder time shutting down.
6.	Keep a journal by your bed for your anxious thoughts. My counselor suggested this to me and I find it helps. If I am in bed trying to sleep but my mind is racing about work or future plans or the fear of not sleeping, I'll sit up and grab my notebook and jot down all the thoughts. Getting them out of my brain and on paper can bring some relief.
7.	Turn your negative thoughts into positive thoughts. This has been one of the hardest but most beneficial practices I've tried so far. When you find yourself thinking ""I'll never sleep again"" or ""I'm going to have health issues"" or ""I'm going crazy"", immediately rephrase those thoughts and make them positive. ""It's NORMAL to have trouble sleeping sometimes."" ""If I don't get much sleep tonight, I will still be ok."" ""I might be tired in the morning but I will get through the day and sleep well tomorrow."" ""Nothing bad is going to happen to me if I don't sleep well tonight.""
8.	Don't check the time. One of my worst habits when having trouble sleeping is checking my watch or my phone for the time and counting in my head how many hours of sleep I have left till it's time to get up in the morning. DON'T DO IT! If you wear a watch, take it off at night and put it out of reach. Same with your phone or alarm clock. As long as you have an alarm set, there is no reason to constantly check the time. It will only cause more stress.
9.	If you've been in bed for 30 minutes or more actively trying to sleep but with no luck, get up and leave the room for a bit. Read a book for a while, do a boring chore like dishes or laundry, watch something boring on TV. After 20-30 minutes of this, go back to bed and try again. Sometimes the worst thing we can do is sit there in bed, wide awake, stewing over everything in our brains and driving ourselves farther away from sleep.
10.	Consider medication but be careful. We don't want to become reliant on pills to sleep, but sometimes that is the best answer. For the past year I would take either benedryl, tylenol PM, or nyquil almost every night in the hopes it would knock me out. Sometimes it worked but sometimes it didn't. Melatonin helped a little but not significantly. I also use CBD oil on occasion which helps me but similarly to the melatonin. Recently I decided to ask my doctor about an antidepressant called amitriptyline, specifically to help my IBS symptoms but I heard it can also help with sleep issues and anxiety. I've been taking it now for about six months and my sleep has greatly improved. It doesn't knock me on my ass but instead removes the anxious thoughts and let's my brain fall asleep slowly and naturally. It's not the right drug for everybody, I've read others' accounts that it made them sleep for too long or feel hungover/groggy the next day. I haven't had any side effects but they can exist. Don't be afraid to talk to a doctor about the possibility of taking medication for it.
11.	Weighted blank! I love mine, it's great. Helps me feel safe and tucked in."

Anxietyhelp,fjabm03,t3_fcdd0h,1583170206.0,"What is she currently doing for anxiety? Therapy? Medication? Both of those have changed my life, but it took me a long time to ask for that kind of help. I thought I should be able to fix my anxiety on my own. 

One thing that I always encourage is for people to face their fears. By giving into those fears, whether it be agoraphobia, or health anxiety, or fear of certain social situations, etc., we make them bigger and scarier. I used to have severe anxiety about work meetings. Whether it was two people or 50, I would freak out and often call in sick just to avoid them. But by doing that I was just adding to the fear, giving in to it. Finally I started forcing myself to go to the meetings. I would wear a rubber band on my wrist and flick it whenever I felt myself getting anxious. But after it ended I would remind myself that nothing bad had happened and congratulate myself for facing that fear. It took time and practice but now I have little to no anxiety during work meetings."
Sinusitis,fjaaf3h,t3_fceh48,1583169609.0,"I was having monthly infections and flare ups for six years, up until October of 2019. I started taking Singulair along with Flonase and Azelastine sprays at night before bed. I still have some bad days, still deal with some daily congestion and drainage. But I have not had a full blown infection or severe flare up since October. I do rinses with my Navage as needed but haven't needed them more than once or twice a week. This won't necessarily work for everyone, my allergist who told me I have no allergies also said Singulair either works for someone or it doesn't and they aren't sure why."

HealthAnxiety,fj7ypn3,t3_fc11kr,1583101222.0,Did they get tested before returning? Highly unlikely you'll catch anything amd I'm guessing you're young and healthy so highly unlikely if you did get it that you would get seriously ill.
