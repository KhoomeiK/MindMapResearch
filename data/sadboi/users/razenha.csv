exjw,fpb7k5k,t3_gccbq2,1588463788.0,"Existem muitas pessoas que estão na sua situação ou já passaram por ela. Você cresce na organização sem questionar muito o que se aprende, faz sua vida lá, seus amigos são TJs, sua família é TJ, toda sua vida esta dentro da organização, você se batiza, continua na organização e depois de um tempo começa a perceber coisas que não fazem sentido no que é ensinado. Fica com receio de despeitar a Jeová, fica com medo de fazer sua própria pesquisa, mas com o tempo o incômodo com as inconsistências da Torre fica grande demais, até que você toma coragem e começa a pesquisar, e vai descobrindo pouco a pouco que as coisas que a organização ensina não são tão corretas assim... 

Você tem um desejo inato de fazer o que é certo e acreditar no que é verdadeiro, então continua a pesquisa e descobre que várias coisas que são inconsistentes com a própria Bíblia, com o registro histórico, com a ciência e até mesmo com a própria lógica. No começo. sua doutrinação e dissonância cognitiva tenta arranjar desculpas e respostas que afirmem que o que a Torre diz é falso, mas com o tempo as mentiras e inconsistências são tantas que sua mente não consegue mais suportar. Todas as defesas emocionais e cognitivas contra o contraditório e o pensamento crítico que foram colocadas pela Torre não conseguem mais te enganar. 

Aí você fica numa encruzilhada. Você percebe que a organização não é ""a verdade"". Mas sabe que as consequências de demonstrar mesmo a menor das discordâncias é das mais graves: a organização tem o poder de instantaneamente destruir o seu relacionamento com seus familiares e amigos TJs, algo que teria um impacto maligno na sua vida. Isso não é acidente, é feito de caso pensado para manter na linha mesmo os que não concordam mais com a organização. Muitos são dependentes da família TJ e têm medo de ficarem sem ter como se sustentar. 

Eu posso te dizer que viver na organização sabendo que ela é falsa vai ser muito prejudicial para a sua saúde mental. Com o tempo vai doer no seu cérebro assistir as reuniões, as conversas ""teocráticas"", ir no campo, congressos principalmente. Você não esta acostumado a fingir as coisas. Vai exigir muita energia emocional e mental. Viver assim causa um algo risco de desenvolver depressão e ansiedade.

O que eu posso dizer para você é que existe vida fora da organização. Você pode fazer planos e organizar sua vida pós-Torre. Milhares de ex-tjs conseguiram sair da organização e vivem vidas felizes e com liberdade. Você vai poder se formar o ser humano que você quer ser, e não ser um escravo  do Corpo Governante. Você não vai ser obrigado a acreditar em algo que não faça sentido. Você vai encontrar pessoas que te amam por quem você é, e não por que você faz parte da mesma religião que elas, pessoas que não vão te abandonar por que você pensa diferente delas. Você vai começar a ver que o processo de doutrinação e controle que você passou não é algo exclusivo das TJs, existem milhares de organizações seculares e religiosas que usam as mesmas técnicas para exercer poder sobre os seus membros, mas sua experiência no salão vai te deixar mais preparado para se proteger desse tipo de influência.

Agora existem algumas coisas que você precisa fazer:

1. Cuidar da sua saúde mental. Isso é sua prioridade número 1. O risco de você desenvolver problemas psicológicos que vão te acompanhar por anos é alto. Tente achar alguém que não seja TJ que você possa conversar para desabafar e tentar organizar seus pensamentos. Pode ser um amigo ou parente que não tenha relação com as TJs. Pode ser aqui no Reddit, ou em muitos dos grupos de ex-tjs do Facebook. Leia sobre saúde mental, depressão e ansiedade para identificar os sintomas e procurar ajuda se for necessário.
2. Ser discreto. Você provavelmente não esta acostumado a fingir. É difícil ter que esconder certas coisas de seus pais e dos irmãos do salão. Mas se eles verem você como alguém que esta duvidando da organização, as coisas podem ficar mais difíceis ainda, vão ficar em cima de você, vão começar a te vigiar mais, vão ficar querendo fazer reuniões de ""encorajamento"" e, se acharem que não vão conseguir mais trazer você de volta para a esfera de controle mental da organização, vão de desassociar. Não há nada pior do que você ser desassociado sem ter se preparado para sua vida pós-Torre.
3. Continue pesquisando. Quanto menos dúvidas você tiver, mais fácil vai ser tomar uma decisão. Se as TJs tem a verdade, pesquisar só vai fortalecer a sua fé e te dar argumentos para defender a organização, pois a verdade não pode ser provada falsa pela mentira, e sim o contrário. Se eles não têm a verdade, então a pesquisa vai te ajudar a entender por que elas estão erradas e ter dar motivação para não viver uma mentira. Não se limite a estudar apenas as falhas e inconsistências doutrinais e históricas da Torre, estude sobre como organizações como as TJs conseguem exercer esse alto nível de controle mental sobre as pessoas. Estude sobre outras organizações de alto controle, como por exemplo, os mórmons, Jim Jones, cientologistas, etc. Estude sobre dissonância cognitiva. Eu recomendo fortemente o livro ""combating cult mind control"".
4. Faça planos para poder se sustentar. O Brasil é um país complicado. Você tem regiões com boas oportunidades de emprego, mas custo de vida alto, ou regiões com custo de vida baixo mas poucas oportunidades de emprego. Você vai precisar de alguma formação profissional para viver com um mínimo de segurança e conforto. Pense em profissões que você possa exercer que vão te dar a oportunidade de ganham o suficiente pra se sustentar no menor tempo possível. Eu trabalho com desenvolvimento de software, graças a isso consegui sair de casa e me sustentar confortavelmente bem cedo na vida. Mas aí depende muito de você. Só toma cuidado para não entrar em alguma profissão que vai te demorar muito para você conseguir se sustentar. 
5. Faça amigos e tenha um círculo social fora da organização. É difícil fazer isso sendo TJ e morando em casa de TJs por que eles vão de censurar se você fizer amizade com ""mundanos"". Um bom começo seria você falar com seus parentes que são são TJs. Se você trabalha ou estuda, faz algum curso, futebol, inglês, etc, pode tentar se aproximar de colegas. Você vai se surpreender em como as pessoas são simpáticas quando você explica para elas a situação na organização, de que ela usa as famílias e amigos como uma arma. 

Se precisar, pode falar comigo pelo chat.

Parabéns pela sua coragem de pesquisar o que é correto ou não. Boa sorte nessa sua jornada."

My kingdom hall was in one of the city's richest areas, so we had a number of well-off jws, but most of them were low middle class or poor, lot's of living in janitors and maids who earned very little.

The elders decided to renovate the hall, it needed to remove the disgusting 70's main hall carpet and redo the sound system wiring, but, for some unknown reason, the well-off elders decided to renovate a bunch of other things like changing the upstair tile floors, even though there was nothing wrong with them. That was nonsensical enough. The renovation was supposed to last for less than a month and cost about 20k USD, it ends up costing more than double and lasting for many months.

At one point, some elder (who probably was not one of the rich ones) decided to buy and install new tiles that were simple but functional.

Those are the kind of tiles that they use in the kingdom hall's at the poor neighborhoods"".

She felt that it was her ""Christan obligation"" to report what was told in confidence to the elders and the patient was disfellowship, but they were very mad with my friend and reported her to the psychologist's board.

exjw,fek21qs,t3_epk80b,1579190937.0,"It's important to have realistic expectations. It's common for children of JW who don't want to be a JW to think that if they just give their parents a reasonable explanation using logic and rational arguments on why they don't want to be JW, the parents will accept the arguments, respect their wishes and leave them alone. That's most likely not going to happen. Most likely your parents will think that you are either naive, just going through a rebel phase, or are under the influence of Satan and/or apostate material. 

It's hard to know what to do in a situation like that. Confronting them might have negative effects as their brainwashing probably will make them feel that it's their obligation to change your mind and force you to become a JW, no matter the costs. But pretending to believe and go through the motions until you are old enough to leave own your own can be very damaging to your mental health."
