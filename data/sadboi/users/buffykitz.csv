My Mum always does this too when I try to reach out and connect with her - which happens very rarely these days. just when you think things are actually going ok, bam! something comes up that makes you realise - hot damn, the woman is toxic as hell and this is what she'll always be. but that's not on you, it's on her. remember that....and have SUCH a great wedding, honey. we're all standing behind you."

depression,f7u7mvw,t3_dxp0co,1574012323.0,"I've spent the majority of my life battling with dark feelings. Sometimes for me, I can't decide if it's better to be numb all the time or angry all the time - because those can be the only choices when things are particularly bad. 

I don't know how to make you feel better or even how to give you hope for the future. All I can do is say I see you, and know your pain and acknowledge the hurt behind these words. It's the absolute fucking worse. 

BUT I do know that these feelings pass and go away eventually. One day a switch will just flip, and you'll feel slightly better over one small thing. Over time these small things can roll over and add up to more until you are suddenly much better. Just hang on to that thought if you can."
