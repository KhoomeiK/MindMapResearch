Thank you for pointing out that error. I meant the Great Depression.

As for the rest of your post, yes. I'm very familiar with the short falls that states and cities are facing. I am on calls WEEKLY with NaCo, NLC, NGA, as well as tons of housing organizations. We work and represent housing activists and advocates across the US, and including California. That's why everyone is working to find safe ways to reopen, as I said, before. 

Look, i don't mince words, okay? Yes, states are hurting. Yes, we're in a crisis. Yes, people are scared. Yes, people are concerned about their economic well being and making decisions in the now to figure it out because they may have to. Yes, to all of that.

But you keep DUMPING your anxieties and stress between the lines of my words and its not what i'm saying. You are ASSUMING that i'm saying we can flip a switch and turn the economy back on. You are ASSUMING that i'm saying that reopening fixes everything. You are ASSUMING that i think this isn't a serious moment.

Just because I'm not freaking out (which you did say in your original post) and panicking about the solutions that are being talked about and the scope of the problem, does not mean that I don't care or don't take it seriously. Maybe don't judge others (which you ALSO said in your original post) for whatever decisions they want to make during this crisis. We are all trying our best to figure things out. 

Your post was triggering for some. It was full of panic and anxiety and while you may not see that or appreciate others SENSING that, that's what it was. I am not mad with your post, i think the intentions were clear, but it was a bit much. That's all."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fpvz4wa,t3_gfthdr,1588954427.0,">Edited to say: I'm really sorry that this seemed to trigger anxiety for so many of you.

Its okay! Everyone is really stressed and elevated and I know your post had good intentions. I appreciate the sentiment. I think we should make reasonable judgement about a lot of things in the upcoming months but in the meantime, take care of ourselves and each other."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fpvxfvn,t1_fpvvrjj,1588953566.0,"> Nowhere did I say ""total economic devastation."" I said ""unprecedented"" which is absolutely factual. We are 100% experiencing unprecedented economic devastation and if you think we are going to bounce right back at the snap of a finger, like flipping a light switch, I really think you're being naive.

The reason i can say that with confidence is because as a federal housing lobbyist, we talk DAILY about the scope of this pandemic with states, cities, and the federal government and while maybe 6-8 weeks ago that was a concern, that's not the concern now. Unprecedented economic devastation....define that. What do you mean by devastated. We're in a global economy and while we're hurting, no one is FREAKING out to that level at all. We have several countries talking about reopening, we have countries that have already reopened. We are pumping more aid into our country in the last 8 years than we have in entire fiscal years. 

I never said we'd bounce back immediately. I said that we will hurt and we are hurting but based on most measurements, we're in a Recession at best. We're not in a Great Depression. The only reason talking heads like to make that comparison is because 24/7 news stations need to say things to make people watch it ALL DAY for ad revenue and also because we don't have anything in memory to compare this to. Also like comparisons to the Spanish Flu, an era when we barely even understood disease transmission, the average American by today's standards then were malnourished, and hte lifespan was like 60. Not exactly comparable. 

>  But it's going to take a long time. I think people should be mentally prepared to stick through it. That doesn't mean freaking out, and one symptom of freaking out is making rash decisions that you wouldn't have made otherwise.

It may take a while yes. At least until there's a vaccine. But I mean... okay? Again put this in perspective. Let's say a vaccine is created in 3 years. 2023. that's just 3 years of your life. Your ENTIRE life. What were you doing 3 years ago. What about some randomly selected 3 year period from 10-15 years ago. Do you see what I mean? Yes, while in it, it seems like forever, but it won't be. And if it is, then humans will adapt, like they always do. The issue now is the 'what if'. we can't say this is a new normal yet. We're all in transition. Once the chips settle, we can decide where we are and how we feel about it but by then, we would have adapted enough so that the disruption isn't as traumatic anymore.

>  I'm suggesting that if, all of a sudden, you're considering major life changes maybe sit on it for a bit before you make a permanent decision during a crazy time that is likely to be completely different in a couple of months.

That's fine advice. But it has nothing to do with pandemic. That's just general life advice. Some people MAY have to make sudden decisions during all this, and don't have the luxury of waiting. Others have had almost NO major life changes except they cant' see friends. I have friends who say this has been the best thing to their mental health in years and others who say they are very depressed and need hotlines right now. 

> How is that alarmist?

Again, I stand by my comment. I did not misread your post. I read your post in its entirely, and I gave my opinion. You disagree with that opinion and that's fine. But I mean it when I say that your post likely doesn't help people with anxiety levels. Saying we're experiencing unprecedented economic devastation is alarmist when the April 2020 DOL Unemployment is 14.7%. The Great Decession was like 25%. That 14.7% is measured by those seeking unemployment. Well that number will drop when states slowly reopen and people can actually go to work. Many industries cannot work due to literally governments saying no, you cannot operate, as well as drop in demand. Will they hurt? Sure. Will it last a while, yes. 

Also, during the Great Depression, a lot of that hurt was that there was no Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, Unemployment Insurance, NOTHING. We have those things in place. We have tons of programs to help people now, on top of what we're trying to pass in Congress. Plus we have now more than 75 years of additional medical and health intelligence to inform what we do. We're gonna hurt but we're gonna be better eventually. 

I think people should just lobby their state legislatures to push for adequate testing since many states have already flattened the curve and seeing declines. If there's adequate testing, they can reopen. 

My state of PA opened 34 counties today. They will announce more this afternoon. We have millions of people in our state. They have the most data and they're working around the clock to make this work for as many people as possible while managing loss of life. Its alarmist to suggest while governments around the world are working to now reopen that we're facing, still, unprecedented economic devastation."

We're not at total economic devastation or even close. Many countries are already reopening slowly.  Unemployment at the peak of the great depression was 25% even. Stop. We're in a recession. Its hurting people. But talking potentially economic devastation? that would be the end of the us economy.  We likely wouldn't have internet. NO ONE would be working or working from home.....Girl if that's where we were,  why are you even on a money diaries subreddit? 

Have some perspective. 

I work on federal policy and NO ONE in Congress has even uttered the thought or hinted at what you're thinking. Words matter. Choose them wisely. 

Most of the job loss is due to shutdown. If we reopen properly,  many will go back to work immediately. Unemployment would drop as a result gradually. CBO estimates we could be at 9% by end of 2021 while not great,  is not total economic devastation. The problem is that if a business is closed too long,  they may not be able to reopen and cease operation. Hence all the federal attempts to keep people on payroll through prgms like the PPP.

people are scared. Your post isn't helpful. 

I would say though that anyone who is able to look into virtual counseling. I just signed up myself. Talk to a professional. Find ways to manage your stress. 

Finally. Let's think about this. We're stronger than we realize. Im Nigerian. My mom lived through the biafra war,  where 2 million Nigerians DIED. Many of your grandparents lived through ww2. Some lived through the halocaust. Almost every person here is 1-2 generations removed from true poverty. Remember that the ""war on poverty"" was just started in the 60s. Not to mention we've survived EVERY famine,  EVERY pandemic,  EVERY war That's every existed as humans. 

Even if the world fundamentally changes,  we'll figure it out. Humans always have.

If they're charging you with no balance on the card, I would get a lawyer to mail them. I bet they'd respond sooner"

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fmg0ynp,t3_fupf90,1586038987.0,"Frankly, I don't believe there is a limit. If you have the income to pay it comfortably, you have enough. Let's say you have 10k of student loans. Someone with 10k in income, that's a lot. Someone with 50k and money to pay it, its maybe not that much. Someone with 100k, maybe its nothing. Maybe its a lot because you have that loan, your mortgage, medical debt, etc. It really depends on each person's individual financial picture.

I make 63k and I have 80k in student loans and my payments are like 270/mo and I'm comfortable. But I also lowered my other expenses a lot so it works for me. Someone with no discretionary income likely would be pressured by that 270/mo."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fmcbx90,t3_fu7g3t,1585942736.0,"**Frustrations:**

* Being around my bf 24/7. I love him but ugh.
* Harder time job hunting. I REALLY want a new job and this coronavirus threw a whole monkey wrench into that.
* Unemployment. While I'm still employed, my bf will likely be unemployed for most of the rest of the year. Many of our plans, like engagement rings, saving for a house, etc, is now on hold. :(

**Things I'm thankful for:** 

* Employment. I have a steady paycheck still and we're not at risk of eviction or anything.
* My health. I've always been healthy and I'm staying healthy by continuing to exercise outside and not gain weight. So far, I've lost about 8 lbs since the quarantine.
* My boyfriend. If he was a terrible partner, this quarantine would have been horrible. Its nice having a fun and supportive person on this journey."
birthcontrol,fm34zzo,t3_fsod6b,1585713026.0,"some may say it will go away but the truth is that every woman is different. some will not have any obvious issues and others will be super annoyed until/unless they stop taking their birth control. i say give it a cycle or two and if you hate it (regardless of what doctors say) then stop taking it and try a different method. 

i don't think women should endure any physical symptoms that drive them up the wall just to be 'protected'. if you hate hormonal birth control, there's other options like a copper IUD which shouldn't have any bloating but does increase bleeding. 

i have a mirena and while its very effective, i am bloated every since day since I had it put in in February. I work out all the time. I eat well. Its not my diet. Its the hormonal IUD. that's it. i had the same issue with Yaz. Hormones = bloat and weight gain for me. Done and done.

When I had a paragard, I had no bloating at all which was great, but I will say these things did occur and they were problematic for me: SERIOUS bleeding. i became anemic. and also lots more discharge, which was uncomfortable. it also gave me (this isn't happening to most women) lots of BV and YI so i stopped using it. 

i talked about it with my bf and he's supportive of whatever bc method i use. but its a struggle finding what's right for YOUR body, so just check in with yourself and make the decision that is best for YOU."
MoneyDiariesACTIVE,fm17cpv,t3_fsb7mf,1585673321.0,"I did a big chop to cut off all my damaged hair. Right now i have 2.5-3 inches throughout my head but its so TIGHT, my curls, and it shrinks, so it looks like its 1/2 inch long. I hope to just grow it out and then have a nice afro by the end of summer.

When I was relaxed, I spent SOOOOO MUCH on my hair and I hated it."
