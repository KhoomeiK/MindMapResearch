Remember, what you are experiencing is totally expected. Not having meds can quickly lead to withdrawl symptoms because your body is missing something it needs to function the way it was before. It will take some time for the levels of your meds to build back up in your system so please keep in touch with your support group and/or us here until you level out again.

"". When it's at rest–all the time except sexual arousal and childbirth–the vagina's muscle tissue remains tightly folded like a closed accordion. Anxiety makes the vaginal musculature clench even tighter...After relaxing during sex, vaginal muscle tissue naturally contracts—tightens—again. Intercourse does not permanently stretch the vagina. This process, loosening during arousal and tightening afterward, happens no matter how often the woman has sex.""

Eventually someone hears and takes it seriously, for me that was my husband. Once that one person notices and acknowledges the problem then more people start gathering around you.

My husbands family rallied around him first to help him, then me because they saw me as someone with worth. They became my reason to live and now I'm finding more reasons as I grow and heal.

I can't say that reaching out 100% works, because I doubt it does. It's worth it to at the very least try. Just remember, only you can decide what to do. Some people that is ending their lives, some people its finding a new purpose.
