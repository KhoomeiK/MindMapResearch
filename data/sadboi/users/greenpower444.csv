Anxiety,fqxy3ka,t3_epe6k3,1589739604.0,"Me too!! I deleted mine after leaving a toxic job that required you to have a HUGE social media presence. My screen time on my cell phone went down 5 hours a day once I quit my job and stopped using FB and IG. 
It‚Äôs amazing how many fake friends you really have and it‚Äôs perfectly normal to only have 1-4 good friends. 
There are sooooo many more important things in life than social media."

depression,fqpz1nm,t3_gk0ga1,1589556559.0,"Physically, I get very tired and lethargic. I don‚Äôt want to be active, yet I don‚Äôt want to lay in bed or play video games all day so it feels like I‚Äôm being pulled in half which exhaust me even more. Sometimes, like today, I only drag myself out of bed to pee and it feels like there‚Äôs a 60 pound weight in my chest. I also have a weird feeling in the back of my eyes because I feel like I want to cry all the time. 

Mentally, I start to think of all of the times I was bullied, left out, and condescended. I know I‚Äôm not a victim and I hate to think that way. Sometimes I just space out for hours as I lay in bed, I don‚Äôt even want to look at my phone or laptop, just stare into the void. 

Everyday isn‚Äôt like this thankfully, but the bad days are starting to outweigh the good days due to quarantine (I‚Äôm in NY so restrictions aren‚Äôt going to be lifted for a few months). Once things start to reopen I‚Äôm going to see a therapist again."

Advice,fqj25ks,t3_ghgofg,1589404021.0,"I just got done working a toxic job for 3 years. Since then, I've been reliving all of the verbal and mental abuse. I, too, kept reliving all of the times I should have stood up for myself and should have said this. It happens at random times, but for some reason it's always the worst when I'm driving, in bed, or in the shower...the only times in which I can't distract my self with anything. Once the quarantine tends, I'm probably going to start going to therapy since it's been a few months and I'm still trying to work through this. 

I'm so sorry you went through all of that. I wish you healing! Please DM me if you ever want to vent or talk."

AskWomen,fq2q876,t3_gd42e0,1589058571.0,"I‚Äôve come to realize that you‚Äôre only really going to have 1-3 really close friends who you trust. With family you won‚Äôt have room to give anyone else attention. I used to be crazy about everyone liking me or wanting to talk to me and wanting to know their opinion of me. But, through experience, I‚Äôve learned friendships can naturally die, people can drift, people‚Äôs opinion of you can change every single day, and people who just talk gossip about other people are shallow. It‚Äôs healthy not to force anything and to just be respectful. 

It‚Äôs much easier said than done, believe me. You‚Äôll feel a weight being lifted off of your shoulder."

ptsd,fpm8fm2,t3_ge3p67,1588727687.0,"Yes. Oh yes. Resentment has been strong for a few months with me :(. I also get so exhausted after my fits of rage that I have to take a nap, then I get ashamed that I wasted so much energy on it so I become depressed. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.
I also have revenge fantasies or ‚Äúwhat if I had done that‚Äù fantasies."
