Ive always wanted to help people. Its something I am very passionate about. I made this server to better reach the depression communities teens. Commonly, (and this is not everyone, this is just speculation) some people can be rude or say that young people can't be sad, say that they are doing things for attention. So I made this server to help teens. Being a teen myself, I wanted to create a Safe haven for us. It can sometimes be easier to talk about your struggles with school or social status or friend groups who are experiencing the same thing right now. I just thought it would be useful."
