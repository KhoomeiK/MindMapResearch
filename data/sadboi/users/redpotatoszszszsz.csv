each person needs options to survive. if u demonstrate otherwise you should be single and relishing growth.

in my experience there is nothing more biologically imprinted than how unattractive not loving and accepting yourself is.

tldr He just doesn’t ‘get it’ and isn’t allowing time to reflect on anything making your compatible odds nil to none"

YOU MUST OWN 


do not fuking apologise for the love of god. You must retain your side of the evolutionary dichotomy. Coming is awsome so say it was the best sex u ever had etc 

never be serious about this stuff 
once respect is lost it never comes back
i swear i’ve apologised only when i make an error that negatively impacts others safety whether mental or physical 

it’s no big deal. u haven’t got tolerance yet so the ol peen was out to paaaarty. Social tradition shames this bs but real men fucking hi five these kinda hilarious stories

don’t be yourself. always be learning and becoming better socially. being yourself means nothing as self should be in flux. strong values yes but don’t be a walkover"
