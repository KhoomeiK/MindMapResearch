Almost every major health organization is saying non-essential employees need to stay home. By taking the 30 you are not only protecting yourself, but you’re protecting your community. 

Besides, you said the rest of your household is still working, right? So if one of them were to get it and pass it throughout your house and you took it to work, wouldn’t that be worse? As someone else mentioned, you can use this time to be a team player for your own household and your store will manage.

im glad theyve finally opened up the policy to include partners who don’t feel safe for cat pay but they’re still downplaying the importance of this issue and trying to squeeze out the last bit of revenue before we go on lockdown and its not right.

i get this is going to have disastrous economic consequences and im sure everyone up top is just as disoriented and worried about what this could mean for the future but the cost of human life (from the virus and from people getting turned away from overcrowded hospitals) is worth shutting the whole thing down now."

i feel like (i wanna assume) they did it the way they did to prioritize partners who were at-risk before rolling out PTO to everyone else. but honestly, staying open during nationwide shut downs atm still looks really bad, and i know its not just starbucks but a lot of companies.

and even then, from what i understand, the extension of catastrophe pay to all partners still hasn’t been clearly communicated, i found out from here and from someone who had to contact our regional manager."

fuck the normalcy of the customers this is a pandemic - an international emergency, normal is GONE and it won’t be back for a long time and people need to accept that rather than keep trying to order matcha frappuccinos. this is hard on *everyone* but the lockdowns and quarantines are for a *reason*"

EDIT: this is rich but i just had a conversation with an SM today where i expressed that stores being open is unsafe and irresponsible and they said that we aren’t being forced to work and that if we don’t feel safe “*there are a lot of resources to use “* – I fucking CALLED it. corporate ass rhetoric acting like the accommodations they’ve offered are really available for everyone and should suffice. 🙄"

mainly, i would just say to give yourself credit; healing takes time and its going to be a while before your spaces feel sacred again and you can confidently go places. celebrate the little victories and try not to beat yourself up if you feel held back."

flash forward to the fallout and suddenly he was “too good” for me. he went from telling me he still loved me and “could never replace me” (i caught him on dating apps) to wanting nothing to do with me and claiming that i wanted to “be someone that had dated him”. he fell apart after us but still treated me like i was insignificant, an annoyance.

i always wondered which was the real him: the one who could be attentive, considerate, romantic, and vulnerable; or the one who was disrespectful, spiteful, and unloaded backhanded compliments, gaslighting, triangulation, and made me feel like i was nothing to him after making me feel like he and i were the whole world. it takes a lot to see it but the painful person is more prominent, no matter how much humanity you can see in them. people shouldn’t make you feel like you are worthless, especially when its a partner.

i think when your partner is inconsistent, its good to take an objective look at them as well as yourself; specifically how you feel and the effect that person has had on you. if the answer is that you have left broken, confused, and miserable – both with and without them; they weren’t any good for you."

starbucksbaristas,fdaycg9,t1_fd7kmv3,1578251745.0,ooh i had a regular give me the stink eye for this! i never really see him and frankly don’t really like him because he’s kinda cocky but one time he very confidently walked up to the register and just said “the usual” while on his phone (not even making eye contact). i gave a very cheery “sure! what is it?” and you could tell he was just as mad as he was embarrassed.
NarcissisticAbuse,fd7v6uq,t1_fd77b4u,1578210622.0,"Thank you i really appreciate that! I feel like even when ive been closed off and *stifle* my empathy, i still bring in the same kind of person and am even drawn to them too lmao its been something im working on noticing.

But on the bright side, like you said, its become a lot easier to see the red flags and when its time to leave them behind."
NarcissisticAbuse,fd6bxhf,t1_fd60a46,1578188624.0,literally you dont realize theyre trying to mimic you until theyre gone and you see the mask fall off its terrifying
NarcissisticAbuse,fd51x48,t3_ek1xi9,1578173437.0,"wow two things about this post stood out to me hard: 

1) the whole thing about narcs stalking their next supply to project the perfect partner. i remember in the beginning when my ex would call me every day and ask me 1000 questions about myself like he was genuinely interested there was a moment where i woke up at 5am (after being on the phone with him all night, of course) because i got a notification that someone had liked one of my tumblr posts and the username was vaguely similar to his last name but wasn’t the blog he had followed me on. when i checked it the post had been unliked so i couldn’t see the notification on my app and i couldn’t find the blog after that. it was weird and clearly an accident and i thought it might have been him but i never brought it up and forgot about it.

2) a coworker of mine who ive been getting close to was venting to me about how he gets “bored” in all of his relationships and then everyone he talks to “goes crazy” over him and “gets obsessed” and the first thing i thought of was my ex; especially because they’re similar in a lot of ways. 😷 im either a fucking magnet or i can’t tell what healthy is anymore."
starbucksbaristas,fd0jw5d,t1_fd03tpj,1578119872.0,even better when they say it on the drive thru “can i get a matcha latte and a mocha frappuccino? and for mine can you put extra caramel?” 🙄 how am i supposed to know which one is yours?
starbucksbaristas,fd02lnw,t1_fd01myd,1578112716.0,my favorite is when its not even their drink but they wanna be all nosy 😂
starbucksbaristas,fczezrx,t1_fcydcql,1578099760.0,"i always give new people the same spiel: training takes less than a month but no one gets good at this job in the first three months. it takes a long time to learn everything and even longer to get good at it and it can feel incredibly intimidating especially when you notice other partners getting upset that they can’t rely on you yet but it goes away once you start getting comfortable. just don’t be afraid to ask questions and if you can, get to know your coworkers; the job is a lot less stressful when you know people have your back :)"
starbucksbaristas,fcy7uvo,t3_ejid8h,1578075992.0,shifts tend to place people based on their strengths which is great and all until you have partners that are really only experienced in one or two roles. had a similar experience always being on drive until i said something about it to the shifts.
starbucksbaristas,fcy7c84,t3_ejibrh,1578075871.0,yeah no same; work can be absolute hell yet ill still find myself picking up shifts because its better than having to face things i’m avoiding. i even used to do my homework at work off the clock just to get out of my own head. kinda funny in that way to be using a stressful place as a coping mechanism.
NarcissisticAbuse,fcwyxu3,t1_fcwu9d0,1578043670.0,"yes, yes it can. mine and i were 20 and everything you described, i went through too. just because the abuse was subtle on his part doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, it means he was good at hiding it. you regret it, right? you feel like shit because you fell apart trying to keep a relationship together even though he was ripping you apart without lifting a finger? that guilt isn’t something they feel.

hanging out with ex’s, lying to you, making you chase for his affection – even just acknowledgment, being “calm” when you’re hurting so you look like a nutjob while he looks like the bigger person – its almost worse than the kind of abuse thats up front because you leave feeling like something terrible happened to you and you can’t figure out what it was. its hard to wrap your head around it because you want so desperately to have been the problem – why? because if you’re the problem you can fix it

forgive yourself for falling apart; recognize the things you regret and work on them so that you don’t carry that pain with you and into other relationships. what happened to you was real and you’re learning to heal from it and that’s okay."
starbucksbaristas,fct13uy,t1_fcsnlq6,1577930154.0,no literally this and the fact starbucks made a public declaration last year RIGHT BEFORE LABOR CUTS that they were going to get more invested in mental health makes me want to vomit
LifeAfterNarcissism,fco4jz5,t1_fco3y4g,1577823947.0,yupp pretty much on the nose. one thing to consider too is that sometimes they use compliments as a weapon. what might seem like them praising someone else can double as a reminder that you aren’t that other person. it can serve as a way to idealize someone else and subtly devalue you at the same time.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fcnxhw2,t1_fcnvyjr,1577820374.0,"it may seem like an oxymoron but you have to remember that they are not logical. my ex swore he was never wrong about anything and bragged about himself constantly. yet he still admitted to me that he thought he wasn’t good enough for himself – that his inner self wasn’t worth the beautiful, talented person he was on the outside. they are incredibly insecure in the sense that they never think they are truly good enough but they hide behind a delusional façade of being better than anyone else. again, far from straight-forward, logical thinking."
NarcissisticAbuse,fcnsjm1,t1_fcnr2hj,1577817597.0,"it happens; its hard not to tbh. we learn to love past some of the hardest shit and when you manage to fall for someone that much and really see passed their most hurtful qualities – its hard not to keep caring about them and wonder if their good side will ever stick around. i can’t imagine how much harder that is having to keep a connection with them for your kids.

don’t beat yourself up about wanting a second chance. i struggled with the exact same thing – i *knew* he was no good for me but hearing something, *anything* from him that would have proved he cared even a little bit would have made me run back faster than my feet would have carried me

it helps to remember the bad times – the times they leave you crying, hurting, and confused. it helps you see both sides of him as the same person and it might not make the longing stop but it makes it easier to have the willpower to put your phone down so you don’t press send or call them when you’re vulnerable. good luck, honestly"
NarcissisticAbuse,fcnqi6o,t1_fcnj1an,1577816523.0,"mine did the same thing; you’re not alone. it depends on two things: whether or not theyve found a new supply and how good they are at protecting their image. mine was dating other people towards the end cause he saw i was getting tired of his shit – not cheating, as in hook ups and side hoes; he was *dating*, delivering the lovebombing he poured over me onto someone else.

he also kept it airtight, his image and reputation were valuable to him; groveling to an ex was *beneath* him and seeing as how i was clearly a mess over him – sobbing, shaking, and moving at the pace of a sack of sand – he was “too good” for me. 

the absolute best thing you can do is happiness. live happy, free, and do as you please and he will *writhe* with jealousy. i guarantee you that if he is in any way still in contact, he is watching you – noticing any little thing you post and reading for a subtext that proves you’re still hurting over him; any little sign that he was important to you and he will not make it obvious.

at some point, I started posting really normal stuff – i went out with a couple friends, started drawing again, proclaiming that I was “working on myself”. I didn’t notice until much later but the more i posted to make it look like i was fine (i was trying to recover my own reputation after a few messy online meltdowns), his social media ended up getting messier than mine. videos of him being wasted posted on his story, bizarre behavior plastered all over his snapchat, vague references to captions i had posted on instagram, and suddenly he was hanging out with another ex (that he dangled in my face and knew i was jealous of) with the caption “missed you ❤️”. a friend of mine pointed out that he was trying to make me jealous and it wasn’t in a healthy way – that he was clearly toxic.

I resisted the urge to feed into his ego, tried to move on and keep healing ... until i messed up and groveled for him again; apologizing and saying that *I* was the toxic one. suddenly, he went right back to “being the bigger person” and treated me like i was being immature, crazy, *lesser* than him.

after that last meltdown, i texted him that i was sorry, that i missed him, and that i wished him the best. i took him off of all my social media and deleted his number – no blocks, just no more contact. 

after this complete cleanse, proving that i was *finally* ready to move on – guess who appeared to have watched one of my instagram stories? But i know for a fact that wasn’t *longing* – he was in disbelief that I had really given up on him, that i was ready to move on and free myself from his drama. 

since then i’ve had it happen twice where catfish accounts tried messaging me asking about what i was up to, if i was dating. for a while, any time i’d run into him after that, he looked troubled – unshaven, messy hair, weight gain; like someone who was actually going through it. maybe a coincidence, who knows?

what im saying from all this is that if its clear you want him back; he’ll deny it from you to make you agonize over him. they like to feel desired, wanted; just like anyone else, its like a drug. The difference is they don’t mind if it hurts you for them to get the satisfaction of knowing someone out there would give up their entire world for them. i know it hurts to see them completely unfazed by losing us, like we meant nothing to them – trust me, he might not show it but he definitely won’t like it when he realizes he’s truly lost control over your emotions.

also sorry for the prose lol im binging “You” on netflix and the constant monologues are in my head."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fc9bs35,t3_egrcvc,1577550227.0,"im in the same place rn and i dont know if i can see myself opening up to someone again. it sounds dramatic but i really think ive had enough. its bad enough whenever i meet someone new im terrified of anything nice they say/do being a tactic but even then, just like you, i cant imagine having the energy. i dont know if relationships are even important to me anymore.

supposedly it goes away eventually :) no idea when but eventually."
NarcissisticAbuse,fc73s1m,t3_egez7f,1577496763.0,"okay this is gonna take some being really up-front. this is the mindset that a lot of us have had and it helped us walk right into ruin. yes they are broken, sick people who probably have some nice qualities. yes, they can make you feel loved. yes, every one is deserving of love and compassion. that’s not your job though.

you are not here to fix him. no one can just “fix” anyone and no amount of love is going to change him. even therapists don’t just love people back into health, they help the person make change themselves using specific skills, but they have to *want* to change.

please understand that no amount of love and empathy is going to change him or fix him or bring light into his world. the only thing that can come of that is that you will break. weve all been there, im sure. “if i just try a little harder/love him a little more/wait out a few more storms i can be the change he needs in his life” you didnt break him. you don’t deserve to be broken trying to fix him.

the problem with narcissists and the reason they  dont change is because the problems they have feed into each other: theyll never get help or make changes because they can’t see that they are the problem and nothing you do will change that. self-love isnt just telling yourself you like your reflection; its choosing your own needs and emotions and putting yourself first. thats not selfish, its self-preservation and learning to recognize when hurt outweighs healing."
NarcissisticAbuse,fc3oydx,t3_efso0d,1577394992.0,"i remember i accidentally broke my ex’s phone (during the lovebombing phase no less) and i was more upset than he was. “they’re just things” he said. i paid for the replacement but he started the new phone without backing it up – no need to recover lost photos or anything. he didn’t care, they were just things. just like when i couldn’t take his abuse anymore, he replaced me too."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fc0incq,t1_fc0czca,1577291674.0,"wow now that you mention it mine used to say the same thing! he used to talk about how i wouldn’t love the real him – the sad part is i still did; in the way you might love a problem child.

thank you im steadily making peace with it as it heads towards the past, i hope the same for you! Merry Christmas to you as well!"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fbyzoqs,t1_fbwwd99,1577230772.0,"i guess it goes both ways then cause i only loved the mask he wore at the beginning; the person underneath was mean, stuck-up, and disrespectful. in a way its kinda sad for them because they overidealize us but we go in as who we really are; they put forward a fantasy that *they* cant even live up to."
