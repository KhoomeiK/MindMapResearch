In my relationship, I felt frustrated and like I wasn't being listened to. All my boundaries were ignored and I kept making excuses because I loved him. Eventually i reached the point where one tiny thing happened, and I walked out. He had no idea. He begged for me back, and I gave him a shot, and nothing changed. I expressed how frustrated I felt that none of the changes I wanted were even being listened to, let alone actioned. 
They weren't big changes that i was asking for either, more like spending one night of the weekend together. 

I'm done, now. 


You know in yourself whether this relationship is healthy for you. Talk it out with your partner, but look at their behavioural changes (or lack thereof) and make your decisions based on that. 
Know that being alone isn't as scary as it can seem. You have so much time ahead of you - you will be OK."
AustralianTeachers,fj7ofa9,t1_fj7iltt,1583094754.0,"In Victoria, you can't register as a teacher without sitting LANTITE, unless you graduated prior to 2016. As this teacher graduated before 2016, but without a teaching licence, I presume it is up to the governing body, but LANTITE is definitely  connected with teacher registration with the VIT.

From their website:
If you applied for registration on or after 1 Jan 2019

LANTITE will be considered a qualification requirement.

This means that if you have not satisfactorily completed the LANTITE, you are not qualified to be registered as a teacher.

We can only approve your application for provisional registration if you have satisfactorily completed the LANTITE and meet all other requirements for registration
