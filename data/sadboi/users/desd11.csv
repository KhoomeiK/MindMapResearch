BPD,fn06c2z,t3_fyh7we,1586536232.0,"I struggle with this too. When I’m having a particularly emotional day, seeing couples on TV or even walking down the street holding hands can bring me to tears. It used to make me angry and jealous that I didn’t have someone who loves me romantically and now it just makes me sad because I feel like I’m unlovable.. I’ve used mantras to help with this trigger and it’s helped! When I see couples and I feel the emotion ramping up, I try to tell myself “one day I will experience/have that again and it will feel so good”. It helps me to remember what it feels like to have a partner and not focus on why I don’t have one, at least for that moment, which stops me from crying. I hope you can find something that helps you!

Also, I’ve been down the tinder validation train on and off for several years. I find it to emotionally draining after a while to build shallow relationships just to receive a moment of surface level gratification... At this point and with the current state of the world, I’ve distanced myself from everyone too, only to find out that I enjoy my own company more than anyone else’s company - as long as I keep a decent distance between myself and social media, otherwise I get sucked right back into constantly craving the instant validation and gratification."

BPD,fiyxlxc,t3_fabnq4,1582849301.0,"I can totally relate to everything you said. Life with an FP is hard, feels like mental prison to me. My brain keeps beating me up about how I’m worthless and not good enough when I see them online and they aren’t texting me.. but during the times that I haven’t had an FP, life feels meaningless, hollow, and bleak. Coping is so hard sometimes. I hope you know you’re not alone!"
