If you actually managed to stop your gaming addiction, found new (healthy) ways of spending time, fulfilment in different activities, there's no point in ""going back"" to former addiciton, because that's dangerous. Even if you think you can control it. 

&#x200B;

> This was even better than abstinence. It's the equivalent of an alcoholic having a single drink at a party. 

An alcoholic can never have a single drink at a party. An alcoholic can't turn into moderate drinker. Not on the long shot. Same goes for every other addiction. Same goes for gaming addiction.

Let's say a person, who is religious and believes in god, experiences something traumatic. We can only imagine what this person is going through emotionally. And than on top of that, somebody tells this person that it was all god's will or it has purpose or something like that. Now that traumatized person has to deal with the idea that something extremely bad was god's plan for a higher purpose. And that can just add to the trauma.

On the other hand, a  non-religious person with same experience won't pay as much attention if somebody says it was god's plan if they're not religious in the first place. Yes, it's still abuse in my opinion, but of a different connotation."
