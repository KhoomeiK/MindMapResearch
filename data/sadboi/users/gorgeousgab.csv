technews,ford27t,t1_fon5ibt,1588010165.0,"Inflation has surpassed what wages can keep up with. So to say, why increase wages when inflation will out pace it makes no sense historically or currently. 

Cost of living is already way over what it should be. People aren‚Äôt making that much more money but the cost of things keeps getting higher.... doesn‚Äôt that sound off to you? Instead of accepting the fact & going  ‚Äúwell, everything is getting much more expensive better just deal with it and not make any changes like paying people more and just keep letting the cost of things increase‚Äù but rather going: well, we better keep up with inflation and increase the demand on the individuals which will never be kept up with and will eventually hurt everyone, not just the working pooor.....either way we need to balance whats going on and meet in the middle rather than allowing this to go on....(lots of things need to be changed.)

Would you not agree that what worked for society a century ago is not applicable to current times. But when you have fat cats saying ‚Äúthis has worked for us the past several decades well keep it on board and the lower class (which includes upper middle class and below) can just figure it out on how to keep up and make a profit...‚Äù well knowing its going to be extremely difficult and push out many people of that group (middle class for example) because they can no longer keep up with the cost ...

So what your advocating makes no sense. Not being rude. Wage is not keeping up with inflation...as a result the middle class and beyond that will be no better off either! If its not obvious to you right now just give it time and you‚Äôll see, or your grandkids will see..."

bipolar,fkr3310,t3_fjwa27,1584460890.0,"This happened to me. I dunno what dose you‚Äôre on but maybe you need it decreased. If it is not effective at the decreased dose then you should try another med.

Its interesting, the last time i was on it i was experiencing a serious manic episode was hospitalized & got put on it at 30 mg along with lithium (1200 mg). Initially i felt no side effects but as my mania got under control & I started to feel normal/calm then i started experiencing the side effects. Thats how i know that you take these meds & your body adjusts to the dose. When the dose is too strong you‚Äôre more likely to experience the negative side effects. You‚Äôre suppose to take the lowest possible yet still effective dose. For me that translates to you shouldn‚Äôt have to take a medication forever. I have the more traditional form of bipolar 1 where there is a clear distinction between each episode and periods of being normal in between. Free of any mood extremes.

Im off all meds now. As soon as i got better from that episode (took about 6 months til i was feeling stable & started to wean off both meds). I dont use traditional psych pharmaceuticals for maintenance, only for during crisis/acute treatment. Because they stop working or being of any benefit when i am well and stable. I save them for when i am in the throes of an episode. I feel like I‚Äôve finally found the holy grail for treating my bipolar. Lithium & Abilify or Seroquel for acute treatment & non traditional psych meds (psychedelics) for maintenance. 

Sorry if i went way off topic but i think its important i share that so people can consider it for themselves if its ever an option. Many pharmaceutical psych meds have drawbacks that are long term or just intolerable and they think thats their only choice. Its not/it shouldn‚Äôt be."

Psychosis,fei54bc,t3_eoo4o3,1579130487.0,"I honestly didnt notice any tiredness with Abilify. I suppose I was one of the lucky ones but no matter the dose did i feel more tired ( i went to 30mg for a. medium frame woman) what did make me feel weighed down was Seroquel, but at the right dose it was perfect. That was weird too because depending on the dose (200 mg) i only felt tired by bedtime. Right after i take it. Then i would sleep well for a good 8 hrs and feel good to start my day. I think Seroquel is more of a winner regarding how i would prefer my treatment to go. It was way more effective than Abilify. Abilify was a sort of placebo. I think the aim for pharma/is to find a drug that works in between Seroquel and nothing at all. Well Abilify is nothing at all. Absolutely unnecessary. Just calling out/reviewing these designer/brand name drugs around us. Everyone needs to hear the truth. Anyway maybe they could infer that if it works half the strength of Seroquel and nothing(placebo) it could be used as a maintenance dose. The maintenance dose needs to be effective in the first place. This was bullshit. For me... Abilify gets a 1 out of 5 stars. Seroquel gets a 4 of 5 stars. Abilify just gave me this weird feeling like i had an extra shadow. It was no good for me maybe its trash for you too? I would stop taking it, however NAD(Might as well be) But...let your doc know for sure and i dont think if you wait it out anything is going to change...maybe get better but maybe get worse. How do you want to play this? Maybe you will get used to the tired feeling. When I first took seroquel and feel the sedation but went to sleep and woke up refreshed i had a good feeling. Then my dose increased and i continued to do well. Didn‚Äôt ever really notice a big difference in my the tiredness/sleepiness with the sedation. But all in all it was that tired feeling that helped me get better. It helped me to have a deep sleep... which i was in dire need of i suppose. The thing you should be aiming for is restful sleep. If the sleep is not long enough or too much and you aren‚Äôt feeling better but worse tell your boss. No one wants to sleep all day .....unless you‚Äôre still depressed!"

AskReddit,fefgatr,t3_eondj6,1579055714.0,Two before work one at break one at lunch one at second break one after work one when i get home &then drink the rest liberally before crashing for bed. Totally doable. I already pull off a six a day breaking it up in a similar way.
bipolar2,fdxd4na,t3_en7vn4,1578767608.0,"Yeah. Definitely. I noticed this years ago way before my bipolar diagnosis. I got on birth control and did my best to control the fluctuations that happen during that time of the month. And it definitely helps. With birth control you can control the timing and length of the drop in hormones and then sudden spike that happens. Makes it a little bit easier to maintain.

I tried going off birth control recently for like 2-3 months & immediately went back on cuz i realized what a emotional mess i would become. I had totally forgot.

It makes a lot of sense to me. Not only are our brains dealing with the highs & lows of bipolar disorder but as a woman you throw in the natural hormonal fluctuations that come on every ~28 days we are extremely sensitive to anything that will throw our mood ‚Äústability‚Äù off. Ive decided to be on birth control indefinitely."

bipolar2,f8emne8,t1_f7e98r9,1574530603.0,"okay well good luck. i would just suggest to always get your labs done and once they‚Äôve determined you are within the very narrow window of treatment closely monitor your tsh, t3 and t4. also you gfr and all the other kidney function levels. if you never reach a dose that puts your lithium levels 0.6 - 1.2mmol then theres not point to being on lithium..."

Psychic,f7do1qb,t3_dv4rx8,1573622851.0,"This new opportunity is yours for the taking. Just figure out how to make your next move, but this should not be hard if you really want it. 

The blue tattoo people are connected not necessarily to you tho. They have some sort of connect, try to introduce them to the idea and see how well they vibe. These 2 crossing paths in connection with you could have transformative, creative, vibrant, endless potential. Hard to say what exactly but the blue butterfly has positive spiritual symbolism so the fact that you see the potential that they may not realize exist between the two of them, you are the missing link to something that could be amazing."
