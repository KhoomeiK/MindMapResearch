From what I’ve heard, your mood/mental health should get a lot better once your body adjusts. Still looking into it though. Good luck."

unpopularopinion,f9j2rjw,t3_e5aqez,1575353818.0,"Maybe not exactly child abuse, but I’ve never liked the thought of parents choosing to do that without waiting for the kids to decide for themselves. Everyone who’s talking about how their parents pierced their ears when they were a baby and they grew up fine don’t know anything else except for their ears being pierced. In other words, my parents didn’t pierce my ears and Im extremely grateful for it. I never want them pierced. I have the option still which is what I appreciate the most. People may be fine now, but that’s because they don’t really have any other choice other than having pierced ears."

Both of you had a discussion about not wanting children BUT you both willingly engaged in an activity that had the potential of resulting in one. I’d say get a paternity test first and then go from there. It’s good on you for being ready to pay whatever you need to since you don’t want to be in the picture. It’s none of her friends business especially when you made it clear where you stand with having or not having kids. A pregnant woman a lot of the time starts thinking differently when they get pregnant which explains her change of heart, but yeah it’s on both of you to figure this out. Good luck."

depression,f80o9p5,t1_f8084pp,1574133896.0,That’s where I am. Every time I drive on the freeway I think about just jerking my wheel. Don’t put yourself down because you have no reason to be sad. It’s an illness and it sucks and it can take over anyone. People who have pretty much everything can still have depression. I have a lot of respect for you for continuing to push through this. Hope it gets better for you soon love. Keep going.

depression,f80jzkq,t1_f80j1qz,1574130871.0,"Thanks for taking the time to reply. Not trying to put down the advice, but knowing my parents, it’s safe to say they wouldn’t even consider it because if they don’t need a lower deductible plan, they’re not going to do it for me just because I “think” I need therapy. However, I will push myself to at least try talking to them because it’s not a bad idea. I was thinking about checking out what my college has to offer so I might start there. Thanks again for the support."
