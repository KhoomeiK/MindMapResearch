You can't help it if you're disappointed with it especially if it arrived broken. Does your mum struggle with money? Perhaps this was the best she could afford? Try your best to mend it, and wear it whenever you see her. Don't tell her you don't like it, what good would that do?

AmItheAsshole,epdhqhm,t3_bukkle,1559166465.0,"NTA. You're a grown woman, who's perfectly capable of making her own decisions about her life. Your mum sounds like she wants you to go back to school just to make her proud, or give her bragging rights or something, which is evident in the way she immediately started telling people that you had began contacting colleges. She doesn't seem to care about how you actually feel. She has no right to tell you you're wasting your life etc because you don't have a career that meets her standards. I don't give a flying fuck about what my daughters will choose to do with their lives career wise, I only care that they're happy. That's your job as a parent. Your mum is lashing out at you, and saying things she knows will hurt you, simply because she's not happy with your employment status. That's toxic behaviour, and she sucks for doing it."
parentsofmultiples,ep1xb41,t3_bsx64n,1558998238.0,"Honestly, I was devastated when I found out I was having twins. I can't even repeat what I said to the poor med student who was doing my ultrasound. I can't remember how many times I cried. I was utterly terrified, I didn't know how I was going to do this mentally, physically and financially. My pregnancy was planned, but I had only planned for one. But as my pregnancy progressed I realised that I wasn't doing this on my own, I had a really supportive partner and family. I began to believe in myself after the shock wore off. I was excited to meet my babies. Then when they born, I just immediately fell in love. Don't get me wrong, I was still terrified, and it definitely wasn't easy. I had to learn to ask for help, and there were some really rough times. But it was worth it. I coped because I had to cope, I didn't have any choice, these babies needed me. Then I didn't ""just cope"". I actually loved being a mother to these babies, there were far more good times than bad. You'll cope too, then you'll love it. You'll have times when you're so exhausted that all you'll wanna do is cry. And that's fine, you cry your eyes out if you need to. Then you'll have moments when your babies smile at you, and it'll make the sleepless nights easier to deal with. My girls are seven now. They're healthy and happy and thriving. They're funny and smart and beautiful and sometimes they drive me insane. What you're feeling now is valid and completely normal. People are gonna tell that you'll ""love every minute of it"". Don't feel bad when you don't, no one does. But you've got this, I have complete faith in you."
