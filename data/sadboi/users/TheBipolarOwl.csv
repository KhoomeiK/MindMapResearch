I am also allergic to one of the ingredients: isododecane. That particular ingredient causes “little tiny bumps” around my face, mostly cheeks and forehead. The first time I noticed it I talked to my makeup artist and she said it may be that I was allergic and sure enough.

There are other products that have that same ingredient that gives me the same issue like: la girl pro concealer, juvias place foundation, maybelline age rewind concealer, etc."

bipolar,fn2n0it,t3_fytxh9,1586595168.0,Sounds like a mixed ep or you need meds adjustment
bipolar,fmz64u9,t1_fmwl126,1586507895.0,"Exactly, she even explained it. There’s a video in the link I posted where she talks about it and she basically says that you shouldn’t be scared of your illness, to inform ourselves and accept it, education on our condition helps us tremendously and it’s readily accessible. This sub for example, has a good wealth of information I have used and it immediately made me feel “relieved” that there are other people out there like me. I feel validated and the information is accurate and helpful.

I am way less scared of BP since I joined this sub and I have found so much support from sharing things on here and learning from others."
bipolar,fmz5z2p,t1_fmw9nyp,1586507710.0,"I’ve also noticed that. Older generations are very much driven to more privacy to protect themselves from the stigma. 

I haven’t opened up to the public yet but seeing news like these inspire me to take a baby step forward and tell those who care. It’s small things that can make us brave and take pride in who we are despite of our illness."
bipolar,fmz5sql,t1_fmw481j,1586507516.0,"I’m really sorry you feel that way. I do too, sometimes. Let me ask you something, would you prefer if we don’t get *anything* from bipolar at all? I know that not all of us get the “creative” side but putting shade on those who do is downright mean. They didn’t ask for this, yet it can still be a gift.

I do not envy them in the least, I am glad there’s talent, even with people with chronic mental illness like us.

Also, beauty awards is not the main topic here, they just chose that picture. I obviously didn’t post this here to confirm her beauty."
bipolar,fmz5l1b,t1_fmyfc5h,1586507276.0,"This. Also, I feel okay with some of us becoming successful. I prefer it much more than none of us being able to. It’s inspiring, even though it may seem far away for many. 

I know we’re not lucky like many artists but knowing they’re putting themselves vulnerable like this shows that they have *some* level of humble."

bipolar,flz32yf,t3_frx59b,1585614465.0,"I honestly got promoted 3 times during a 3 year career and this happened to me all around and it was crazy because people actually bought all the crazy optimistic “creative” ideas I had. 

All I have to say is that I obviously had a depression upon stumbling when somebody basically told me to pipe it down and At that moment I realized I felt like a failure because I wasn’t getting anything done anymore.

Also, that’s how I found out I had bipolar. I obviously left my job as I couldn’t take it anymore and was so deep in depression I was pretty sure I had it (not knowing I had bipolar and my entire life I just thought I was good at my job and sometimes I got sad lol)

My actual advice now: you need to get your pdoc to adjust your meds, upping the antipsychotic does the trick for me, not too much just enough to get me off the cloud."

bipolar,flz2d9f,t3_fryg87,1585614026.0,"Hey, I’m a BP mom to a toddler and what works for me is to regularly visit my pdoc and see a psychologist. Mostly, I honestly try to keep myself put together for my child. I sometimes get depressed and my husband becomes the “main parent” and he is very supportive. This is why it’s so essential to have a good support system.

If your friend mostly goes through “depressive episodes” more than hypomanic, then I would suggest she takes it a day at a time and do little victories (arrange kids toys one day, clean the living room the other, work from home if possible, shower every morning or wash face.. etc )

If she mostly goes through hypomania/mania then she could put her extra energy into teaching her kids something new or fun 🌟

bipolar,flz01bl,t3_frzuut,1585612616.0,"I read the entire thing! (I’m proud, I have really bad attention span). Anyway, here’s my 2 cents:

Yes, it’s normal to have mild episodes of highs and lows while on lamotrigine (I literally go through your exact same symptoms, with different hobbies).

They are not harmful if you are not overspending or having risky behavior. However, I find that it affects my depressive episode that will undoubtedly come afterwards because I will realize that my new “obsession” is basically gone and I will have zero interest or motivation to continue them.

Adjusting your meds should only be prescribed by your pdoc but mine told me that usually, if you’re taking the right combination of meds, a hypomanic episode like that could last more or less a month. 

You are still high functioning so I wouldn’t consider it a crisis, but you know... food for thought."

I have had multiple episodes in my lifetime but people happen to think they’re all just quirks or overall weird things I do or say.
