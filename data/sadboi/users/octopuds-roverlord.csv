She said she watched the clips of Eugenia calling her mom looking for her switch and flat out cried. It would take a real scandal for her to talk about Eugenia I think.

EUGENIACOONEY,fqntpug,t1_fqnpc2m,1589501216.0,"Yes. When they deleted her‚Äôs, they deleted Foodie Beauty‚Äôs subreddit too. It was deleted because the mods weren‚Äôt deleting threatening posts or discouraging people from calling her doctor and veterinarian. Everyone there went to the private Facebook group or Kiwi Farms. Both are worse than the reddit ever was kiwi farms especially because they encourage doxxing.

It‚Äôs important for people to realize that most of us are still fans of Eugenia but we feel alienated by her content as it becomes increasingly proana and is catering to fetishists. No one wishes anything bad to happen to her but most of us are in recovery or actively suffering from an eating disorder. Some of her fans are young teens.

She says she‚Äôs not trying to encourage EDs or promote a certain body type, but she‚Äôs a social media influencer so obviously she‚Äôs going to INFLUENCE people.

EUGENIACOONEY,fpi09wz,t1_fphez7h,1588631141.0,I don‚Äôt doubt that she doesn‚Äôt have immediate access to the majority of her earnings.. but I think it‚Äôs more likely her dad has put her money in an IRA and stocks to set aside in preparation for an adult life with a family and retirement that she won‚Äôt live to have at this point.
EUGENIACOONEY,fphznyk,t1_fphq9t1,1588630809.0,"Eugenia‚Äôs explanation is that her grandma has dementia and had an outburst while searching for a forever lost purse. It makes more sense than her mom standing in the living room screaming ‚ÄúI WANT THE MONEY.‚Äù But that leads to another interesting point, they can afford to have the grandma in a private nursing home which is ridiculously expensive.  Maybe Eugenia could afford ONE of these expenses, but never all of them. It‚Äôs time to move away from conspiracy theories and just face the fact that the person fucking up Eugenia‚Äôs life the most is herself. She can‚Äôt live alone because she‚Äôs too sick and she probably doesn‚Äôt want to because she could never afford the luxuries that she‚Äôs accustomed too."

Every family is different but in the end it always boils down to some combination of the person experiencing a trauma, the family being dysfunctional and and enabling them because they feel guilty, co-dependence, and the person with the addiction being manipulative and sneaky. Their family dynamic is very strange.. but I‚Äôm starting to think that the sweet personality we see from Eugenia is just an act she uses to manipulate people and hide her ED behaviors."

EUGENIACOONEY,fpgy0kh,t1_fpgwtvl,1588611527.0,It‚Äôs probably being squirreled away in an IRA or a trust or something. Not that she‚Äôs going to be able to use a retirement fund at this rate. They have a very codependent relationship. She wants Eugenia to stay just as much as Eugenia can‚Äôt stand to be on her own. I personally don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs captive there or being forced to stay. She has a really cushy lifestyle living with her parents and her ED would make it hard for her to be on her own either way.
EUGENIACOONEY,fpgx5ve,t1_fpgw8hd,1588611100.0,I think you‚Äôre over estimating how much she earns on twitch by a lot. They were wealthy before she was on YouTube and had two homes in affluent communities and expensive cars. She only started blowing up on YouTube in the last two years or so.
EUGENIACOONEY,fpgwla4,t1_fpgs3q0,1588610808.0,"It‚Äôs really rare to just buy a house that expensive outright. I doubt they‚Äôre so well off that they have multiple millions in liquid assets just lying around but you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs all speculation. Translating it into a mortgage makes it easier to see how expensive their lifestyle would be for a normal person... they aren‚Äôt just a normal upper middle class family... they have ‚Äúfuck you money‚Äù.

And as for her parents, there was a thread a few months ago where someone searched public records for information on her parents. Her father had a DUI, but no divorce records. According to Eugenia they sleep in separate rooms. If they were to divorce, a division of assets depends on which state they consider to be their primary home. California is a communal property state where marital assets are split 50/50, while Connecticut is an equal distribution state where assets are split according to contribution... though it‚Äôs important to note that the length of the marriage and who raised the children gets factored in, and she would still be entitled to alimony. Either way, Debra would not walk away from the marriage unable to maintain her current lifestyle. The truth is they‚Äôre probably still together simply because it‚Äôs easier to stay together and sleep in separate bedrooms than it is to go through a messy divorce that could get dragged out for years. I don‚Äôt think her dad would let Debra take Eugenia‚Äôs money.. he had a sock-puppet twitter a year ago where he defended Eugenia, calling her a ‚Äúfragile person‚Äù."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpgr4wk,t1_fpga48i,1588607994.0,I think a lot of people would act fidgety and anxious after that though. She‚Äôs always been uncomfortable when people confront her about her ED.

You can‚Äôt even get a job as a bank teller if you have a single bill in collections. She‚Äôs mentioned her dad goes back and forth between the homes frequently for work. But it‚Äôs not just 5k alone in mortgage... it‚Äôs easily 10k for each home with interest and taxes.. those all get factored into your monthly mortgage payment and put in escrow. Debra seems like the frugal type to be honest.. as are many women from her generation. Plus, thrifting is somewhat of a hobby for rich suburbanites.. people get a rush finding quality pieces for cheap just like extreme couponing."
EUGENIACOONEY,fpggdyd,t1_fpgb0rt,1588602171.0,"After taxes, it wouldn‚Äôt be very helpful. She makes about the same that a teacher makes in LA. And $59k is only the most she can earn if people don‚Äôt skip the ads with multiple mid roll ads. I saw someone post here that the LA house cost a million dollars and the Connecticut house is also extremely expensive. Just in LA, a million dollar mortgage is around $5000/ month just for the principal, that‚Äôs not counting property taxes, insurance, interest, and HOA fees which can double the amount you pay monthly for your mortgage... and the Cooney‚Äôs have TWO homes. And then there‚Äôs car payments and insurance, utility bills, food, cell phones, Chip‚Äôs college... her parents are exorbitantly wealthy and I highly doubt they would ask Eugenia to help when she earns at best $5000 a month especially when her parents think of her as a fragile invalid."

EUGENIACOONEY,fo93w4y,t1_fo8zvpc,1587609956.0,"A year ago there were a flood of noobs speculating that she doesn‚Äôt eat more than 200 calories a day. It‚Äôs completely impossible for that to be true. I‚Äôm not really interested in doing the calculations again but I used the tdee calculator at losertown and they can show you what the BMI would be of a certain weight/height. Yes, 1000 calories would be considered a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù but her Basal metabolic rate at that time would have only been around 1100 calories a day.

And I think it‚Äôs important to point out that Eugenia eats ‚Äúmore than you think‚Äù because there are a lot of lurking potential anas and young teens on this subreddit who are under the impression that Skeleton Queen Eugenia only eats an apple a day and are doing irreparable damage to their bodies trying to mimic her but the truth is, Eugenia was always on the thinner side and got this way slowly over time and got this way by undercutting her calories by just a few hundred a day. 

Putting that in perspective, it‚Äôs easier to just go on a regular 1200 calorie diet and exercise the healthy way to lose weight instead of torturing yourself with an eating disorder.

And I promise, I‚Äôm not being insensitive, I say all of this as someone who‚Äôs been struggling with an ED for years after getting bad advice from proana sites as a teen."

She isn‚Äôt being ‚Äúgrounded from the internet.‚Äù She‚Äôs just on vacation man."
EUGENIACOONEY,fk33tr8,t3_fg8fqg,1583816810.0,"I think she has more control than most people would think. The issue is that she‚Äôs being held back by her ED and anxiety. She dropped out of high school because of bullying, so I‚Äôm sure that holds her back from furthering her education. She can‚Äôt get a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù because she lacks the education for any employment beyond minimum wage, which isn‚Äôt feasible because she‚Äôs gained too much internet notoriety to be in a service/retail job. She has dreams of being a traditional actress, but that will never happen unless she takes recovery seriously. She still doesn‚Äôt have a driver‚Äôs license, but can afford a personal driver so she could, in theory, go wherever she wants, and did go out frequently before her relapse. She‚Äôs never mentioned having a significant other or even voiced the desire to have one...  not counting Jonas Brothers. 

I know a lot of people speculate that her parents control a large portion of her life, but I really think they‚Äôre just trying (poorly) to minimize the damage she‚Äôs causing to herself. At the end of the day, Eugenia is in a prison of her own creation. The ED, is in control. Not her, not her parents, not her fans."
EUGENIACOONEY,fk2l8ef,t1_fk2kpmp,1583803492.0,I‚Äôll consider your point of view when you admit that Neveck stalked Eugenia. That point keeps being brought up and you deflect that point everytime by bringing up straw man arguments.
EUGENIACOONEY,fk2kjyg,t1_fk2jyyk,1583803070.0,So what‚Äôs the purpose of coming here? You‚Äôre not going to convince anyone here that you or him are anything more than a creep. Just like we aren‚Äôt going to convince you that we have Eugenia‚Äôs best intentions at heart.
EUGENIACOONEY,fk2jvx3,t1_fk2ebxy,1583802653.0,I‚Äôm not totally convinced you aren‚Äôt Neveck. You certainly defend him like you are.

Things can be funny and mean at the same time. You might not have been intentionally making fun of Kate‚Äôs family, but that‚Äôs what it comes off as. You wouldn‚Äôt have hid it if you thought she would join in the laugh. Is it funny? Hell yes. Are you the AH? Also yes."
