I just like to recommend that everyone should take both of the first aid lessons, they are really helpful. 

My little sister almost choked to death too when she was little. My mum is normally really level-headed and always seems to know what to do. But in this situation she completely panicked. She grabbed my little sister and ran to our neighbours. Thankfully our neighbour was able to help. 

It happens so often that children put something into their mouth that they shouldn't. It's scary how fast such a dangerous situation can occur. 

I am glad you were able to save your little one.

Parents are there to love and guide their children. To support them. You are your own person and your parents are there to help you find YOUR way. YOUR path in life. We can advice our children and impart our own wisdom and be always there for them. But children need to be allowed to be their own persons and find their own ways in life. 

The only thing I truly wish for my child is growing up happy and healthy. Sure, it would be awesome if he would be successful later. Find a good job etc. 
But to me the most important thing is his happiness and that we will always have a good relationship. That he knows I am always there for him. 

I hope you are happy and healthy too. Find your own way in life. Do what makes you happy and content. It's your life, shape it however you like. And tell your mum that you appreciate all her efforts and that you love her. Nothing brings us more joy than that."
