SelfieTV,fcr2ngf,t1_f6jlk5t,1577895894.0,Would it be possible to get the episodes from you? I'm embarrassed to admit that I discovered Karen just recently and would love to watch the show. I've searched everywhere and no luck. Thanks.
tomodachilife,fbxa4nm,t3_eeqrs8,1577176493.0,"I can totally sympathize with this. The fights get really old. Especially when one doesn't forgive the other right away, but change their mind later. I've kept track on the pattern of who fights on my island.  There are several who fight, and a few who fight constantly. One or two would even fight in the same day, or the next day. Frustrates the crap out me. I've tried changing personalities but I don't think that works."
aspergers,f4ilrk0,t1_f4ilaow,1571606276.0,I use the brown noise sound for the thumping bass but it doesn’t work for the other noises and I haven’t found the right one.
aspergers,f4ijwaq,t1_f4ij5c7,1571605379.0,"Could those be played on a stereo to drown out the noise? I should have described it in the original post. It’s like a slamming door or dropping something. I use a certain noise to drown out thumping bass and it works great, so I don’t mind going that route. I’ve just tried many different external sounds and so far nothing has worked."
aspergers,f4htg2g,t1_f4glhtq,1571595911.0,I would use earplugs but I have ringing in my ears and silence just makes it louder. And I also want to be able to watch a movie or listen to music.

coasttocoast,f4g9wrc,t3_dkhwlj,1571578969.0,"I remember hearing about him once Art retired the second time around the beginning of the millennium.  I was bummed when Art left the first time, rejoiced when he came back and then the same with the second time.  I listened to Art religiously but when a replacement was on, I stopped. I'm guessing a lot of Art fans stopped listening too."
aspergers,f4g8c5r,t3_dkgozr,1571578546.0,"I've spent years looking for a pair that would at least block out voices.  But after doing research, and trying various ones, I found that they don't do that, or at least not very well. So I gave up on that. But now I have a new reason for a pair. There is this noise that is sporadic throughout the day on the floor below my apartment.  It's not repetitive, but it's loud enough and unpleasant enough to keep me from relaxing and doing anything that isn't a constant droning noise to drown it out. I've tried everything that I can but nothing has worked, even talked to the manager, and left a note on the door of that tenant, but nothing. The only option I see left is to get a pair of NC headphones. Except they aren't cheap and my financial situation isn't good at the moment. Had a salesperson at Best Buy tell me that a specific pair should help with that. I prefer in ear instead of over the ear because of sensation. Problem is that they are very expensive, so I'm saving up for them. Until then, whenever I'm in my room and it's a certain time of day, I have to have the noise on. Only at night is it quiet. And I'm a night owl which makes it great. Just hate that I have to resort to this, but I am desperate. And until my wife and I can afford to move, this is it. I hope this wasn't too long and I hope I didn't hijack the thread. I just wanted to throw in my experience regarding NC headphones. Thanks."

Windows10,f2e0uuq,t1_f2d89vo,1570174071.0,This may sound like a dumb question but I just want to be sure but is it fine to leave the pc to update on its own or check up on it every so often in case there is anything that needs to be done manually?
Windows10,f2dnpi2,t1_f2d89vo,1570159221.0,Thanks for the reply. Appreciate it. My computer is almost 3 years old but is the specs are still good. Don’t know them off the top of my head. I’d have to check.
Windows10,f2ad20j,t1_f27btvy,1570111818.0,Again I appreciate your help. I'll PM you now.
Windows10,f2acxur,t3_dc9s9t,1570111777.0,"Thanks for all the responses. I really appreciate it. I'm about halfway through backing everything up. I have another thing I'm curious about. Once I'm ready to update, is there a ballpark figure on how long the update will take to install? Thanks."
Windows10,f27bn97,t1_f276d6x,1570034622.0,Definitely. I'll keep in touch. Should we do that through here or e-mail?
Windows10,f27684y,t1_f2741hm,1570031474.0,Thank you very much. I will definitely look into that. I've been on the fence about upgrading to a paid version but if you could help me that would be great!
Windows10,f27645e,t1_f273fw3,1570031413.0,"Yeah, I checked and I'm on 1803. I apologize for the confusion. You're right."
Windows10,f273t5k,t1_f272qw1,1570030104.0,"I do have a fair amount of software that I like to carry over from a previous PC to a new one. I'm trying to remember how I moved everything over to this one from the old one. But I don't mind making a backup image. I have it on a big enough hard drive that I can put other stuff on it as well. And all the hard drives are SATA, no SSD's."
Windows10,f26wr29,t1_f26vnbg,1570025365.0,"I've looked up all the ones you mentioned, and actually I did some research into cloud storage and backup before but couldn't decide on what to go with. Plus my budget at the time limited me. And now my budget is even tighter than it was before so I'm not sure what to do. I take advantage of the Acronis because it came free with the drive. My PC has 2 TB and I have 3/4ths of it full though I'm working on clearing up stuff so it's not as cluttered. What's your opinion on Acronis?"
Windows10,f26vbi0,t1_f26uivt,1570024323.0,It's already been out from what I've heard it's just Microsoft is pushing for it saying that the version I'm on now will not be supported when November comes and I can pick a time for the update to happen. Not sure if that's like an hour of a day or a day in the future. Afraid to click on it in case it starts something because I am nowhere near ready to update.
Windows10,f26v5d8,t1_f26ukyu,1570024195.0,So no need to bother with creating a specific backup to load up in case something happens?
Windows10,f26ua3i,t3_dc9s9t,1570023544.0,"All you guys have a point. I appreciate them all. Thank you. I guess one more question I would ask would be the best way to back up. For years I've been using a free version of Acronis which came with a WD external drive I bought years ago. Back up the PC regularly and actually never needed to use the backup (knock on wood). So should I continue to use that? Or something else. I wanted to do that along with a drag and drop of everything just in case, because I get extra paranoid when it comes to making as many copies of something as possible. I had a hard drive fail on me in an old computer that had some stuff that I wish I could have saved. I used that PC for other things, like servers for local streaming media mainly. And then I had the replacement HD die so that one had to be replaced and since then everything has been good. The only time that has happened. So I back up as much as my budget will allow."
Windows10,f26ssxi,t1_f26rpba,1570022402.0,Have you talked to others or heard from others who've updated that haven't had a problem either? It seemed like from everything I read the ones who didn't have a problem were in the minority.

depression,f20k8mv,t3_db0bhz,1569860647.0,"I feel that exact same way. Only a few times did I actually have a plan and wanted to actually kill myself. But mostly, like right at this exact moment, besides wanting to cut myself, I just want to either sleep forever, or just fade away and disappear forever."
depression,f20jxro,t1_eysq1tk,1569860546.0,"I apologize for just responding now. I feel terrible for saying this but I haven't had the guts to come back until now. Part of me feels relieved that I got it all out but part of me is embarrassed that now so much of me is out there now. I'm currently rewriting some of the novel and adding some things. And also working on some other shorter stories. But I've learned a lot from that experience and what has happened since. Good and bad. Since I wrote this I feel like it's not as much things have gotten worse as much as I've gotten worse. Things around me seem darker and things in my head seem darker. Which I always find hard to believe but it's possible. Meds still aren't helping and seeing the counselor more. Last visit with the prescriber didn't go well. I'm just exhausted mentally and physically. But as I keep telling myself, and as others do as well, just keep going and don't give up. Though I don't see anything changing or getting better. Even the slightest, the tiniest thing.  I panicked the other day and had a mini-meltdown when I was thinking about how as of now I can't even imagine what my future would be like right now. It scares me that I have no idea what is going to happen, in a year, a few months, a month, a few weeks, a week, or even tomorrow. My stress level is constantly high partly because of this which I'm pretty sure is causing most, if not all of my physical issues. I see the psychologist for Disability tomorrow and I'm so stressed about that. I want to make sure that it goes right. That I don't blow it. And right now a huge chunk of the stress comes from soon needing to sit down with my wife's parents and talk about the money issue. For some reason I am scared about what will happen. I don't know why. I just don't do well with unknowns. Probably my Aspergers, I don't know. But I've been dreading this for months. So everything's a big mess and it's taking all my energy to keep from shutting down and giving up completely. I appreciate the response and I'm always around browsing and reading. I try to respond as quickly as possible but with my anxiety I'm terrible at it, and I apologize. If I get any more updates I will add to this. Thanks again."
tomodachilife,f1b10m0,t3_d5yeon,1569318537.0,"I've always wanted to watch a fight start and I got lucky once. But most of the time I miss it.  A couple times I had couples fight like anyone else, and then they get divorced. I even had a couple get married one day, get into a fight, and then the next day divorce. I was surprised, then pissed that I went through the trouble of the proposal mini game for nothing lol. I've also seen the amicable breakup in a public place once but it's been a while. Divorces have happened while I wasn't playing. But most of the time a Mii would tell me that a relationship wasn't going well and to either try to fix it or move on. Most of the time the game is predictable, but sometimes it throws me a curve. I've been playing it for almost a year so the surprises a few and far between but its still fun."
