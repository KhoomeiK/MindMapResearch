AskReddit,fpx5zae,t3_gfsi0q,1588976309.0,"When I was in elementary school, like grade 6, I went to a pretty small school (300 students max) that was out in the country: Completely surrounded by farms/fields. It was recess and my best friend and I decided to go to the bathroom. We asked the teacher and then headed in. We walked into the bathroom, and the place was completely blood soaked. There was blood splattered everywhere. On the walls/sinks/under the sinks/on the floors/the stall doors/on the toilets/just.. Everywhere. Its was terrifying. The smell was so bad too. It looked like a scene from a horror movie. We both ran out and to the principles office in a huge panic, crying and trying to explain what we saw. He grabbed the janitor and we went back to the bathroom. We opened the door and stepped in, and there was nothing. No blood. Not on the walls, not in the sinks, not anywhere. It was all gone. It also smelled like a normal bathroom, no blood smells. The adults looked at us like ""was that a prank?"" But we were so terrified and traumatized. It was so real.  

We kept it to ourselves but didnt really talk about it after that. We stayed away from that bathroom for the rest of our elementary school life. 

I recently brought this up to that same friend, asking if she remembers that (thinking maybe I made it up) but nope. She still remembers it. 10 years later and she still remembers the same details as me. I still have nO clue what happened, but it cant be coincidence that we remember the same details 10 years later despite only talking about it a few times when it happened. 

We had another paranormal experience in the bathroom before, but not as significant."

medical,fpuh4s8,t3_gfgwai,1588912761.0,"Just like another person commented, if it was cardiac related, it likely wasn't very painful. People do have different significant cardiac events without actually realizing it, meaning they were pain free. Actually I caught one of my patients having a heart attacks through a regular vitals check (checking pulse, blood pressure, temperature, Oxygen saturations, respiratory rate) and he was just chilling and eating his breakfast before I came in the room.  

That being said, pain is a very subjective thing. But a lot of people do die peacefully. 
Warning: this next part might be hard for you to read: 

The following scenario happens a lot of times with individuals in end-stage heart failure: when the heart stops pumping (or significantly reduces its workload), oxygen stops flowing throughout the body. The oxygen that was flowing is quickly used up and the person will begin to feel faint/drowsy/dizzy. The person then falls unconscious and the body begins to shut down in other ways, but tries to preserve the brain (which is why they pass out first). As time passes, everything stops and the person has moved onto whatever lies waiting for them. 

I'm so so sorry about your dad. I can't even begin to imagine how you must be feeling right now. Know that there is no one right way to cope, and everything you feel is valid.
