asexuality,fr21hjz,t3_gm07o9,1589829534.0,"I can see where you're coming from. I do think that having stricter guidelines for what counts as ace makes it a little harder for a lot of ace people to know if it's okay to consider themselves ace, though. I understand not wanting to stamp the label everywhere until people no longer understand it, but the flipside is that people who wonder will think they're not allowed to do so, and that it's wrong to want to be included in something you feel you have common ground with. 

In that way, before I got old enough to fully articulate why I consider myself ace--that being the huge sensory issues I have with many sexual aspects, enough to make me nauseated at the thought--I thought I wasn't allowed to consider this. I thought that I was just weird for not liking the sexual things other people were into, all throughout college, and others called me a prude and Virgin Mary for the same. It was only once I learned more about asexuality, and how it was a whole spectrum and not strictly hating sex or thinking sex was bad, that I realized this would explain my weirdness, and in that way, I did have the definitive moment of realization that you say doesn't really happen. And, once I became part of the community and saw so many people who thought the way I did, I only became more convinced that this was me. So, having stricter definitions is something important, but also very much something we need to be *very* careful of, because you might ostracize the very people who need to know more about this."

AskReddit,fqz51zn,t3_glq9bs,1589760049.0,"Mine started off as a dream about my brother and I going to one of the old neighborhoods we used to live in and finding a bunch of unfinished four-story houses in the back. We decided to use one as a clubhouse, and we were going to get our dad to help us bring up some couches and other furniture. We went exploring in the house we were thinking of using, going to the top floor and looking at the view out the window.

Only the view wasn't our old Florida neighborhood anymore, but a rusted, greasy wasteland. It looked like if someone dumped a bunch of brown oil paint onto a Dr. Seuss book. It freaked us out, and we turned to go down, only to find that everywhere we looked, the house kept changing. There were traps appearing, like spikes and laser, and monsters climbing up the stairs to chase us, and more monsters appeared every time we turned. We took to going back-to-back, to make sure nothing was outside our vision, and sort of scooting down the stairs that way. The place was way, way too big, and we kept finding other kids who were lost and had apparently been lost in this place for a while. By the time we reached the door, there were about seven of us.

Outside was a big, broken-down shipyard, with a rusty warehouse to one side and an actual black lagoon on the other. There was an old man at the peer working on an old ship and muttering crazily to himself. We gravitated towards him, as he was the only human adult we'd all found so far, and at first he was extremely paranoid and tried to shoo us, because he didn't want us to bring the monsters to him. We were all scared kids, though, and scared kids are stubborn, so we made him take us with him on the boat--he said it was the only way out. He told us to do exactly as we were told and not to anger the Bathanesda, under any circumstances, which would eat us alive.

Almost immediately the boat was attacked by sea monsters, which looked a bit like those reaper dragons off of Subnautica. The boat's halls were flooding, alarms were blaring, and at the boat's lowest deck, the monsters were ripping up holes and we could see their arms and tendrils grasping at us. We were only far enough in the lake to reach a giant buoy bobbing by the sea's exit, and the old man made us all abandon the boat to jump on the buoy. While we did, he tried to get the canon on top of the boat working. I missed my jump and a sea monster grabbed me, pulling me underwater right as these *other* sea monsters, which were like giant barracudas, started attacking the first ones. There was *so much blood*, and I couldn't see anything under the water, so I swum upwards and my brother grabbed my hand and pulled me onto the buoy. The old man got the canon working and shouted at us to hang on, and he shot the monster holding onto the buoy, which made it sink down and get eaten by the giant barracudas. The buoy shot upwards without the monster's pressure on it, shaking up and down in the water as it righted itself. 

The canon made the boat sink, and the old man joined us on the buoy. We asked him if one of those  monsters was the Bathanesda, and he said no, but the barracudas were its babies. As he said that, we all looked down, and this *giant eye* opened up beneath us. It was bigger than the whole four-story house from the beginning. It was so big that it glowed straight through the inky black in the lagoon. The old man said it was too late, the Bathanesda was awake.

Then I woke up."

They're just dreams. Occasionally they have direct relations to a movie or something that happened recently or something you dread. But, they're not poems that your English teacher stands over your shoulder to say that every single line is a metaphor. 

This dream is just something goofy that happens sometimes. It's not a prophecy. It's not something to base your lifestyle on. Doing that will limit you severely because every time you dream, you think it must mean something special that you have to alter your whole life around. It's just your brain throwing assets together to make something for your senses to be safe inside while the rest of your brain does Maintenance Duty on your body. Please don't force yourself to follow all these guidelines based on dreams, because many times, even if you have the best intentions, you're making yourself see your life differently, in ways you didn't need to, sometimes in arbitrary or less than helpful ways. Learn about yourself by living life, not by attributing prophetic meaning to your imagination. 

I'm not saying that to fight or be harsh, but because every dream on this subreddit has people making a comment that sounds like a tarot card reading. I know you want to help, you have good intentions and you're being genuine, I just don't think you're going about it the right way."

nosleep,fp7j46u,t3_gbq0f0,1588371585.0,"It's like all the old stories say; you respect people, nature, and the world around you, or it will not respect you. If it's not okay to demand power from a human, sacrifice to them, or blackmail them with threats, then it's not okay to do that with a nonhuman, either. It's sad how many people are too stupid to understand that. ""What, the golden rule?? But I'm better than you!"" At the end of the day, when you have nothing and are nothing, you are no better than all the other nothing in the world."

fo76,for5eq7,t1_for4uia,1588006472.0,"The cap sinks make more sense, I can see that. The AI spawning is a little finicky, since my latest character is level 15 and getting level 40 enemies, but if it used to be much worse, then I'm glad I'm playing now and not then. The building I completely agree with; I had Place Everywhere, and Scrap Everything, and Conquest, and Sim Settlements, which is excessive, I know, but I build such enormous, detailed cities in 4 with those. It's very strange to suddenly be focusing on one little house with one little farm, and be unable to use most decorations due to trying to find plans for them."
fo76,for2vbd,t1_for2mj1,1588005235.0,"I'm not trying to complain, I'm trying to say, ""here's my impression as a previous hater trying the game a year later."" I just wanted to say what I've thought of the game so far. Just because it's not a sparkling, positive review doesn't mean I wanted it to be 4 with friends. If you read what I said, you'd see that I actually complimented 76 for a lot of the issues with 4 that they fixed, like the armor, the HUD, and blueprinting. The negatives are about the engine and story, not the comparison to 4."
fo76,for2m7m,t1_for246e,1588005112.0,"I know the lore is addressed, but it's addressed in ways that are like, ""well, we wrote ourselves into a corner, how to we get out?"" Which is why I said it's like a fanfiction. I've looked deeper into all the story elements I have a problem with, and I'm glad they have story *for* those elements, I just think the story could have been done better, or written out entirely. Like, the Mothman Cult is super original and neat! And the Chinese Liberators group hidden in so many labs! Why have that and then just reuse the BOS and Enclave?

I do agree that maybe I shouldn't have expected a jump in quality. I'm just used to companies using engine upgrades to upgrade many of their other problems in previous engines. Yes, this can bring in new problems, but Nintendo and Sega and Bioware at least *try* to address old problems first. Maybe I'm giving Bathesda too much credit, considering how poorly they've treated the team running this game."

You're affecting people, impacting their lives, for better or worse. The choices you make are a part of the denizens on your land and the people in town, and every camper who visits. You're more important than you realize, and the best you can do is make the best of the time you have.

Is there another subreddit for the specific face this cat is making that *isn't* this subreddit? If you're going to post this picture for the face, this would be the subreddit to do it in, so why should they be criticized for that?

This isn't a professional, classy subreddit, this is a cute subreddit about cats scrunching up their faces with their teeth out. You're not some heroic intellectual because you harass people. Don't get mad at me for being sick of your attitude; judging by your downvotes, everyone else is, too. This is a subreddit for fun, so go be mad and uptight somewhere else."

Last week I woke up very upset with my mom because I dreamed she walked in asking to borrow one of my indigestion pills, but I couldn't hear her well so I asked which one, and she got sad and went ""okay, fine"" and walked out, and I shouted after her, ""wait, you can't just walk out like that after waking me up!""
