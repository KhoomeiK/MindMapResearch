infj,f8dlzbp,t3_dx35qr,1574497619.0,"When I have to make any type of conversation in the near future, I always tend to have this whole monologue of what I’m going to say and how they’re going to react or what their response will sound like and so on.. (you know, INFJ things).

The problem arises when I want to say something (let’s say a topic) I believe in but also know that the same thing is prone to some degree of criticism.

It’s like I’m forced to give my explanations regarding the criticism as an inevitable addition with the topic (this is all before any actual conversation takes place all in my head). This opens up the discussion in my head to if give further explanations and the conversation just becomes too unrealistic to carry out, so I get anxious to wing the conversation.

So naturally, I act all weird and look stupid during the conversation which had previously seemed so clear and logical in my head.

Looking for guidance/advice?"
