You're right about that concussion idea. I've read that they're graded and I'm not a high grade because I didn't lose my balance or lose consciousness. 

I just wanted to ask about getting hit directly in the head. If I do get hit in the head and it causes a concussion then that happens due to a powerful force rather than my head moving rapidly. 

Wouldn't that be the sake case with me where my head didn't move, but there was a strong force?

Anxiety,fecmbn5,t3_eof0tl,1578977456.0,"Oh yeah, I sort of had this once. I had a computer science class years ago and I was a little behind on this one section of a coding project. My teacher wasn't happy and I could tell she was annoyed. 

Despite having a busy day and it was Friday I got back home at 6PM. I coded from 6PM until 2AM. My family were worried about me not leaving the room and even went to see my to ask if everything is okay because I normally roam around the house like a cat. That's because I'm a heavy procrastinator. 

When I got back to class on Monday, my teacher checked my work (she checked everybody's work that day) and she was shocked. She said I did a lot of work and the more she looked at the work I did, the more her jaw dropped. She was really impressed and I got the impression that she thought I was a hard worker from then on. 

My anxiety would normally be ""at the surface"" meaning that I can feel it which leads me to procrastinate and play video games all day. During this period the anxiety felt like it was internal and forced me to work that much. 

I'm telling you, if all us anxious people can find a way to change our anxiety from procrastinating (or other negative behaviours) into working hard and working constantly then people with anxiety will have an unfair advantage in academics, the workforce etc over people who don't have anxiety. 

I did speak to one other Redditors awhile ago and he does exactly what you do. I wish I could do what you do all the time because I think you basically have a superpower. 

I hope I don't sound like a horrible person saying that anxiety can be a superpower. Anxiety had destroyed me in the last 17 months, but if I can turn it into that hard working attribute then I'll welcome the anxiety with open arms.

Anxiety,fdh620j,t1_fdh5gk0,1578416152.0,"Yeah, the IV is the hardest bit, but it's a very common procedure and you can still be given it even if you're not having surgery. 

My grandmother had antibiotic IV about 1.5 years ago and she never needed surgery."
Anxiety,fdh4x8k,t3_eld9xk,1578415459.0,"I know how you feel. I get this feeling when things that I have obtain issues such as my laptop. 

My best advice is that what happened to you with the tire is not common at all. You have your car checked by a professional and it he have it the all clear. 

I'm absolutely sure you gonna be okay."
Anxiety,fdh4gz9,t3_eldhbe,1578415181.0,"Op, you're not pathetic. It looks like you went through a lot and you're pushing through it. That's really inspiring. 

You've made a fresh start. Try making friends if you can, especially at work as you'll see them regularly. 

You'll be okay. I know how new beginnings can be, but it's gonna feel very normal soon. 

Have a good day and speak to us again if you need more help. There are thousands of us here to help. 🙂👍"
Anxiety,fdh46yk,t3_eldsz0,1578415009.0,"I've never had surgery before, but my sister has multiple times. Basically, you just get an injection that makes you slowly fall asleep. You'll then suddenly notice that you're awake. The operation is complete and successful and you're resting on a nice comfy bed. 

If you have any concerns then do speak to the nurses, as you mentioned. They'll make sure you're okay. This is always the case. When I had my first MRI the nurse/radiographer made sure I was okay and comfortable. She was really nice. I wasn't nervous about it at all, but still. 

It's the same when I have a blood test. All the phlebotomists were really nice to me and made absolutely sure I was okay. 

I promise you'll be okay, OP. Everybody knows what they're doing as they've done it time and time again. 

Good luck for the operation. Speak to us if you have anymore concerns or if you want to vent. 🙂👍"
Anxiety,fdgs5k2,t1_fdgk2lv,1578406931.0,"Yeah, I really do think it's a placebo, but also I think it's that you took a step towards healing yourself, just like you said. 

Good luck at uni. You'll smash it."
Anxiety,fdgkstw,t1_fdgjmp5,1578400661.0,"Honestly, I'm the same. It's okay. It happens to us anxiety sufferers. I hope you have a good rest of the day to make up for it. 🙂👍"
Anxiety,fdgj0do,t3_elao9q,1578398788.0,Aww. I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll be okay. I'm sending over a big internet hug your way.
Anxiety,fdgivn7,t3_elal9j,1578398641.0,"I think it could be a placebo. I've tried different medications for my anxiety (including the one you mentioned) and I've never had an immediate effect. I think the way SSRIs are supposed to work is that it takes time to build up in your bloodstream. 

So basically, I think it's a placebo."
Anxiety,fdgir0j,t1_fdgfcv2,1578398493.0,"Sometimes the issue with insomnia (or really sleep in general) is that even if you've had the recommended amount of sleep the ""quality"" if sleep isn't as good. This means that you don't feel as rested, despite the hours you've put in. 

I'm afraid that's where my knowledge about all this ends."
Anxiety,fdg24bn,t3_el6ln9,1578377204.0,"I get this when I have a lack of sleep. Basically, one reason why you sleep is so that your brain organises things such as your experiences through the day. It's essentially a sorting system. 

I suspect that when you don't sleep your mind goes into overdrive and that's why you feel the way you do. In fact, if you don't sleep then your brain will start sorting things out while you're awake. This happens with a process called micro sleeping where you suddenly fall asleep for a very short amount of time so that your brain can do its thing. 

So yeah, I do experience what you do. I would also suggest that if you have Insomnia then it's common to not feel rested even though you've slept for an appropriate number of hours which should be 7-9 hours of sleep."
Anxiety,fdfrots,t3_el5oqb,1578368555.0,"Sorry to hear about this. Maybe you could get to know that person you mentioned before (the one you rolled your eyes to). You could tell her about how it's going because you mentioned that it felt good to get your feelings out. 

You could also message is if you can, but I suspect that's gonna be difficult as you're timed on everything?"
Anxiety,fdfrir9,t3_el5gq2,1578368443.0,I get this when I'm doing much. I find that exercising helps. Find a sport that you love and try it. If you don't like it then find another sport until you find one that you like enough to stick with.
Anxiety,fdfkybi,t3_el2581,1578364115.0,Hell yeah! I'm super happy for you. Congratulations. Good look at college. You'll smash it.
Anxiety,fdcj9qw,t3_ekmykr,1578276278.0,"I know this might sound weird, but try going to school early? When I was in school we had a class with our personal tutor for 15 minutes. If you got there early then barely anyone was there. Over time the class size builds up. If you get there late then it's crowded. 

Taking this into account, try getting to school and classes early to eventually get used to the amount of people there. This is assuming you have social anxiety. 

I hope this helps. I pretty much just plucked this one out of the air, but it's what I would do to manage my social anxiety. 

Take care and good luck at school."
Anxiety,fd6x9qf,t3_ek7csl,1578196866.0,"I'm telling you it won't happen. Nobody would be stupid enough to target a commercial airliner, it's way too high in the air, the flight path can change if necessary and your flight has nothing with the Iran/US conflict. It would be utterly pointless to attack your plane. 

The way flying planes works is that they have something called ""flight corridors"". These are areas that planes are allowed to go into and move around. Iran or whomever else will know this and therefore avoid these planes. 

Also, have you seen how high planes are in the sky? There's not a chance you'll get hit if they tried for some insane reason."
offmychest,fd3673b,t1_fd32k1t,1578155125.0,Hmm. I haven't done so well in my life so I hate meeting relatives. Before all this I loved to go out and meet my relatives. It's basically social anxiety so maybe you have something similar?
offmychest,fd32bsi,t3_ejyd7r,1578154098.0,Do you feel anxious when you're there or can you just not be bothered at all?
offmychest,fd30rb1,t3_ejxomd,1578153667.0,"Do you have anxiety? You could talk to us at /r/anxiety if you like. I have what you have and it turns out it's common for anxious people. 

All the best."
offmychest,fd2sha7,t3_ejxsdt,1578151246.0,"I've never had a girlfriend, failed my pre-university exams and I'm expected to go to university soon. I'm almost in my mid 20s. 

I didn't know what I wanted to study either. I first wanted to do physics, then computer science and now I'm settled on maths. I may even go on to do medicine when I'm around 40. 

You're fine. When I was your age I felt the same way, but you have so much time left. It may not feel that way, but it's so true. 

Good luck. I'm sure you'll do great in life."
Anxiety,fd2rprt,t1_fd2qugy,1578150994.0,"But someone mistakes ruin you and your life will never reach that potential you had because that one mistake will take it all away.  I understand that your past could be used as a way to inspire you, but not from this mistake. I was told it's okay and I shouldn't worry, but I can't stop worrying and thinking about it over and over again."
Anxiety,fd2o9gr,t3_ejxhbg,1578150038.0,"Omg this is me. I have tourettes/ motor tic disorder. They recorded me and my anxiety started when I thought about him putting it on the internet. I barely had a digital footprint since, but that incident took it to the next level. 

You do hear about people where they make a mistake in their past such as a Facebook post and then that's used against them in the future. They often have to stand down from political positions and so on. 

I'm terrified something like that will happen to me one day. I really hate the internet sometimes."
Anxiety,fd2a0lh,t3_ejw9lx,1578144046.0,"Yep, I have. I had one where I woke up in my bed and I got up to get out of my room. When I opened the door I was back in bed again. It happened 3 times for me to notice something was wrong and then I woke up. The dream felt so real."
Anxiety,fd1ydi2,t1_fd1xtyv,1578138751.0,If that's the case then I'm worried I could have PTSD because it sounds similar to what I have.
Anxiety,fd1y7iu,t3_ejvjug,1578138679.0,I had thoughts spiral out of control 17 months ago when my anxiety started. It got worse and worse and it sounds exactly like what happened to you. It was more to do with how it would affect my future rather than anything immediate.
