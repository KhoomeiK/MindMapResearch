RedditLaqueristas,f31uqu7,t3_df3wrp,1570585291.0,"Acrylic nails do not have to be longer than your average nail, they can be fairly short without it even having a lot of free edge but of course that also depends on the skill level of your nail tech. I think speaking your concerns to your nail tech can help you find a reasonable and comfortable length that suits your needs and everyday life! :) 
Hope this helps!"
mentalillness,f2lfo8m,t3_ddj00w,1570294471.0,"> If you're honest and say you just wanna die and be done with it they'll strap you down and send you priso- I mean the psych ward so they're not liable if you actually do kill yourself

I've never been able to put that thought into words. It makes me ashamed to even say anything to my therapist because then she says that she's close to sending me to the psych ward again, and not to mention the fact that my mom made it seem like going in the first place was as bad as dropping out of school which made me feel guilty of my own feelings and being suicidal."
RedditLaqueristas,f238z6n,t1_f22cd90,1569911299.0,"hello! all of these things I'm gonna say are pretty much based off of personal experience and I'm in no way a professional, just a nail enthusiast! And also with the assumption that you know the basics of nail care such as cuticle care, nail oil, etc. but doing your own research can definitely be a huge help to you and your nail journey! :D
a good video that helps with nail care (for natural nails though so keep that in mind)  is from simplynailogical's ""How to grow your nails"" (another youtuber that does artificial nails and is an actual professional, not just a nail enthusiast, is the channel Nail Career Education! ) 

So the fake nails staying on can be different for everyone as everyone has different nail bed shapes, the cuticle growth on your nail and how much oil your fingernails come in contact (whether it be from touching your hair, face, or products with oil in them) so what I do to help keep on my artificial nail is first by pushing back/removing the cuticle, removing all oils on the nail by wiping it down with acetone, and gently buffing the surface of the natural nail with a file so the adhesive can use the surface of your nail to grab onto much better. 
There are other factors that do come in play such as you picking at your artificial nails, using them as tools or biting them. so with these things in mind, they can last you from days (as most people are used to) or even up to several weeks. My longest time I had them on before I had to fill them in/one fell off was about 2 1/2 weeks :) 

Once they fall off though, theoretically you can use them again but I wouldn't recommend it as eventually the nail glue can build up and the fake nail won't even be sitting on your natural nail anymore and just a pile of glue. And no you dont have to take them off at night/before a shower :) 

Sorry for the long post but I hope you get something from it!! and good luck with your nail journey!"
learnart,f0yazxe,t3_d74ncb,1569065556.0,I love this!!! :D so cute and I love the mix of organic life and artificial life! Reminds me of that one level from Mario Odyssey where forest life and robots are mixed with each other. :)

It was very nice to put my thoughts on a canvas, and now I paint on small canvases since it's so therapeutic! :D"
