Anxietyhelp,fpscp1w,t1_fpscif8,1588871247.0,"Totally agree, it really help to soothe a bit to see that there’s so many other people struggling too, because I think a characteristic of anxiety is that it tries to make you feel isolated. Thank you again ☺️💜"
Anxietyhelp,fpsckfu,t1_fpsbxi4,1588871185.0,No this was a great reply thank you so much! I had totally forgotten about the concept of grounding and how much it used to help when I would be extremely anxious. I definitely need to work on letting things go and not trying to control everything around me! Thank you and good luck to you too on your path ❤️
Anxietyhelp,fpsccjg,t1_fps29ky,1588871081.0,Thank you so much! I’ll definitely try a couple of those things you suggested I really appreciate you taking the time to reply! 💜
Anxietyhelp,fpsc81k,t1_fprrq7z,1588871020.0,That’s a really good point and I think the reason I’m struggling so much right at this moment is that I hadn’t really felt bad much at all up until today. Thank you so much for your reply!! Love and light your way too!

BattlefieldV,fotufou,t1_foqem8s,1588066512.0,"Yeah! Honestly I just found BFV so frustrating, and especially switching over from BF1 where I’ve played so much I know the way everything works, and I was open to doing the same when starting out playing BFV but it just didn’t live up to expectation at all."

BattlefieldV,foqe7q3,t1_foqdwwi,1587991409.0,"Yeah I’m so happy all the servers are back full again, I don’t even have issues matchmaking for mode like wars pigeons anymore which is a big bonus! I couldn’t get my head around the BFV maps, I would be running rotations and people would be ending up behind me, or all over the map. I mean to be fair spawns were never that wonderful even in BF1 but spawning and getting sniped as you spawn is just no fun at all."
BattlefieldV,foqcodz,t1_foq9a8h,1587990239.0,"This is just so accurate. I forced myself to play BFV for nearly a month because the BF1 servers were so empty for a while. Switched back in the last week and it’s just the best. I don’t really notice any difference in movement or shooting, in fact I actually like the weapons so much better in BF1. Totally agree with you."

BattlefieldV,fo123yt,t1_fo0igma,1587424216.0,"Totally agree, I’m just running around with no clue where I’m going, whereas in BF1 I know all the maps inside out, so I should probably lower my expectations a bit lol"
BattlefieldV,fo12133,t1_fo09qx5,1587424173.0,"Yeah I totally agree with that, I’m literally running around maps in all the wrong rotations and missing everyone and then getting shot from behind me so I think I probably need to just grind a bit and get to know the maps. Yeah I probably need to lower my expectations thinking back to when I started playing BF1. Thanks so much!!"
BattlefieldV,fo11u8w,t1_fo024hb,1587424063.0,Thanks! Think I’m struggling cuz I’m missing my automatico lol I’m hoping there’s something that will replace it further down the assault path

headaches,fnkqm57,t3_g23tjy,1587036981.0,"I have tempromandibular joint disorder (TMJ) sounds dramatic but over a third of the population have it without even knowing. It’s basically a slight dysfunction of the joint at the jaw, and it’s really not serious at all but can be painful. With it I get severe headaches, and neck pain and that symptom you described with the clicking neck stuff. It also causes sore teeth and I have a constant clicking in one side of my jaw, but you don’t always have to have that. That could be causing your headaches, however I am not a doctor so it’s very possible it’s not that either. I don’t think it sounds like brain cancer at all. Hopefully this can give you some ideas."

But if you’ve never worked with double reeds before welcome to hell (I’m only half joking). You should start off with less thick reeds if it’s the same as oboe fo build up your stamina. You will also need to practise making a sound from the reed as you need to be able to do this before you can play the instrument. Buying reeds online can be annoying also, not all of them will work just the way you want! Remember not to press too hard on the reed also as this won’t let any air through and you won’t make a sound. Hopefully this helps in some way?
