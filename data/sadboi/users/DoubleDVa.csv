Get roommates and save up on your own."" Heck, my husband's parents are some of the sweetest people I've ever met and they *still* charged him rent to live with them when he finished college. I am assuming she is living there for free or for a tiny cost, so you are essentially subsidising her living expenses for an entire year. From someone who moved out at 18, I don't understand how she can be so ungrateful. Maybe it's just me and I was raised different, but nothing in life is free, and I would be extremely thankful if my family took me in for a year FOR FREE while I stacked up cash to buy a house.

I think your friend is misinformed. This is a norm for all companies at the moment that are ""shut down"" - there is a lot of prep to do before workers come back as far as cleaning. It also takes a lot longer for Boeing to clean high touch areas just because of the sheer size of the factories, don't forget that Everett is the largest building in the world under one roof. I'm shocked they can do it in two weeks, quite honestly. Obviously cleaning goes much faster for office only buildings with a few high touch areas on multiple floors.

Also editing in that it simply doesn't work the way you described it - just because 100 people want to come in and work doesn't mean they actually *can* work. It's a huge team effort on each part of the manufacturing process - just because one guy who does 777 wing joints showed up doesn't mean his job can be done. There is a series of steps to be completed by multiple people one after the other and a majority of the jobs, like I said, are a team effort, so at least 30 other guys would have to show up for 777. 

I'm also confused about the ""PR stunt""? All of the workers are getting their full pay for two weeks, possibly more. Not sure why this is a bad thing."

I've had two of these bad boys at this point. Both took me about two weeks to recover. For reference, I was 18 and 24 when I had them done. My cyst was about the size of a baseball when I had the second one and it honestly took me a good 6 months to recover, and about 8 months to feel fully myself. I started feeling better about a week after surgery, so I started moving a lot but developed a bad blood clot that put me out another two weeks. 

I just wanted to mention this because I feel like SO many people are like, ""oh yeah I was back at work in two days!"". That's great but it's not everyone, and had built a false sense of my own recovery time based on what people were saying that ultimately resulted in my blood clot. Other than these two surgeries, I have no preexisting health issues and am healthy.

I am not a doctor not have I had it but from the ton of reading I've done, the common symptom between everyone is shortness of breath - take a deep breath in the morning and hold for 5 seconds. If it hurts super bad or you can't do it, you may have the virus. Other possible causes could be a severe upper respiratory infection or anxiety, but the shortness of breath won't be as consistent with those. Otherwise, you're most likely COVID-free."
