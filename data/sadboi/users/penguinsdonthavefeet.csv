HVAC,fp6co0q,t1_fp4a6fw,1588350058.0,Well originally when I checked out the apartment he said it either cooled or heated and he couldn't remember.  After I moved in neither worked.  And he said he guess he confused it with another apartment here.  A year later I just felt like opening the ceiling just to take a look.  I fixed a bunch of stuff around the apartment and the landlord didn't mind.  From replacing most electrical outlets and replacing the bath tub spout and drain lever.  And the sliding door wheel bearings.  And the landlord was cool with that.  My apartment rate is about 800 less than surrounding neighbors who rent here..so there's that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

So it could be a bit shocking for the wife to suddenly see this side of him.  And probably she feels left out because she can't relate to the Indian culture that is being taught to her children.

AskReddit,f84rkvg,t3_dz04jt,1574258909.0,"Life can and does get better even if your understanding of it doesn't.  I tend to dwell and ruminate a lot on past experiences.  Tell myself it's to reflect on my life to make myself a better person...but I'm fooling myself because no one is ever perfect and in my quest for perfection I out an unrealistic expectation on myself that includes lots of self induced pressure and stress.  I'm sure I have pocd because of this...plus I've been diagnosed with ADHD and mild autism (used to be called Asperger's).  

I think healing and getting better comes down to how much you can let go and accept that so many things are outside your control no matter how much you think you can change things for the better.  And this may be tricky to accept if your are gifted and very smart or just have a knack of getting through life and eventually solving whatever obstacle that comes your way.

I have a tendency to think a certain way and it's made me who I am today.  And sometimes I think that I have to continue living my life the same way, ruminating in my life's experience to become a more decent human being because of my problems with empathy.  

I don't mean to minimize or be dismissive of your own struggles.  I do not even know what they are.  And everyone has their own personal battles.  But some things in life are just not meant to be fully solved and you just have to live your life and go with whatever life had already thrown at you.  You need to recognize your own thought patterns and tendencies and understand what is helping or hindering you for where you want to be in life.  I know being in the thick of depression it is damn near impossible to see a way out.  Over 30 years of dealing with it...I've come to understand my cycles more clearly and also understand that I may not be thinking as clearly and I believed myself to be.  That I may be thinking to narrowly or unfairly towards others.  My sister made me a scrap book a long time ago when I left for the military.  In it were all the happy moments I had with friends and family that I just totally forgot about...or wasn't even able to remember because of my depression.  Even though the photos were glimpses and just a snapshot of the past...it helped me at least remember there was a time I was happy and that made it easier to recognize the distorted way I could be thinking while going through a cycle of depression...  

I wish you all the best and hope that sharing my experience can somehow help."
