DarkSky is an incredibly high quality service, but this means there is no amount of money I can fork over (short of buying DarkSky itself) to continue using their service. And for what? I understand totally why apple would want to exit the Android market, but at what cost to the members of the community that DarkSky has fostered? My heart weeps."

I find it easier to just do `std::cin >> std::ws`, which reads and throws away whitespace. Not *exactly* the same operation but it solves the same problem.

The cool benefit of std::ws is that it can be chained with other uses of std::cin:

    std::cin >> someInt >> std::ws;

- Not sure if this was intended or not for your experiment, but after the first time you run this function, the param `arr` could be literally anything and it will have the same effect (the static init will only run once; if you look at the assembly for this code, careful observation reveals that C++ internally maintains a boolean of if you've ever called `prepend` before, and skips that line if you have.)"
