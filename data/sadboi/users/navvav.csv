Try your best as to not believe it as it is inherently a big part of how BPD affects you. it is something apparent in most psychiatric illnesses but more so in BPD that it has its own criterion."

ADHD,fl28syf,t3_fm0lmc,1584745500.0,"It differs from person to person depending on quite a few factors, but apparently some people could experience lower sex drive while others might have higher drive.

To you question, Adderall is a neurotransmitter re-uptake inhibitor, specifically norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin, it also increases the amount released of these neurotransmitters into the synapse. Meaning they are stuck there for longer due to adderall blocking them from going back to the pre-synaptic cleft. Sexual pleasure, masturbation specifically, is an instant almost always accessible reward by releasing these chemicals.

However it is still not very clear on why it varies on its effect from person to person, nothing other than the environmental and social factors at least."

ADHD,fikjp2w,t3_f87tqf,1582481630.0,"I’m in med school and honestly view it as a spectrum and how much it affects you, I made it without meds barely through the first year and a half, by barely I mean I I failed every subject in the first year because I basically didn’t study during free time and had 8 repeat exams of which I barely passed using caffeine pills and not sleeping much for a week and a half.

The other half though I realized how much I had to study and bla bla bla, I started studying every day and leaving the library at 10 pm whether I was productive or not I had to stay in, I was still very far off from catching up and I started taking quite high amounts of caffeine during exam period, this is all prior to being diagnosed but I knew I had ADHD due to genetics, and stimulant (caffeine) effects on me. I passed everything except I had to sacrifice one of the finals due to time limitations them I started realizing the lost potential that is there if I was more mentally stable and calmer. 

Might have went off-topic but honestly caffeine with moderation and if meditation works for you then it’ll help, I tried it once and it helped but I keep forgetting to do it or procrastinating on it.
If you are planning to drink or drinking a lot of coffee like I did, take proton pump inhibitors to avoid ulcers. 

Also try to develop habits that tell your brain you are in charge, as I said I used to stay in library, and try not to reward it as much as possible when you notice it wants to go off track.

Tried to make it as short as possible but oh well I wanted to include the examples.

Edit: I’m on concerta right now (Diagnosed on break)"
