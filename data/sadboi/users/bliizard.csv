askscience,ez5rlwf,t1_ez4cu4t,1567703768.0,"I was on an ssri that made me feel numb. I switched to 75mg of venlafaxine and still felt numb. I felt like a robot, confused, couldn’t concentrate, and I was making mistakes in work which I nearly got sacked for. I went to my doctor who put me on 225mg and I got my emotions back. I am now currently on 300mg and I have more energy. The problem is I can’t sleep on a night, but it beats feeling like a numb robot.

At lower doses the medication acts on serotonin, and at higher doses it acts on noradrenaline and dopamine. Noradrenaline seemed to help with my anxiety tremendously. 

If the SSRI is making you feel numb, I suggest telling your doctor and getting put on an SNRI but at a higher dose.

You want the meds to affect noradrenaline and dopamine and not serotonin. 

I found my depression had gone when I was taking an SSRI but I felt that numb and empty I couldn’t handle it no more. I didn’t find nothing funny, I didn’t cry, I wasn’t sad or happy. I just felt empty and felt like my mind was on autopilot. I didn’t feel like I was in control.
