ADHD,fq25uvt,t1_fq1wvcp,1589053104.0,thank you!!
ADHD,fq25qwt,t3_ggeern,1589053076.0,YES! I can understand movies now! plots aren't just a distraction from beautiful scenery or costumes. it's kind of like listening to music I listened to in middle school on a nice speaker instead of crappy headphones...like wow this is what I was missing??
ScienceTeachers,fp4ogxt,t1_fp3czuh,1588303567.0,"this is basically what I do with my homeschoolers. we do two ppt 'lectures' with the most gorgeous photos of plant parts I can find, then have a guided lab activity in the middle. So far, we've done activities like analyzing watershed data from noaa (they have datasets for educators), but they've also really responding to more arts-related assignments as well, like drawing symmetric organisms, or making a small digital poster labeling flower parts using online image editing software. I think encouraging creative expression during this time period is important. 

now how many of these could be administered equitably in a public school setting? could be tough."
dogs,fnvbj8r,t3_g3wuh0,1587287089.0,"You need a basset hound! Or a basset mix. Bassets are play hard sleep hard. During the winter Mavis and I are lazy/snuggly all the time but in the summer she'll easily hike with me a few times a week. She loves hiking/camping. Not as trainable as you specify here though, I don't think many of them are good off leash... If you get a basset mix this may be better. Mavis I will let off leash while hiking if it's solitary enough and we've been communicating well."
BipolarReddit,fnpauab,t3_g34tnp,1587142262.0,"If those symptoms are still happening, I would keep pushing for a check, calling different doctors in my area. Did you contact a cancer specific place or a gastroenterologist?"
askportland,fn3nm9u,t3_fyrj31,1586624320.0,Oooh I wish we had space for him!! we have one basset and two would be incredible üòçüòç hope he finds a home!
ADHD,fmltwkb,t3_fw0vmn,1586193151.0,"this is absolutely me too. I really rely on my partner unfortunately for her weirdly great memory. I'll tell her the same story over and over and she's so patient and will let me know if I've told it before. I often 'over-react' to new information or stories because I forgot about it. it's tough! I cope by keeping a notepad around with me and writing everything I actually need to remember down. for example, I take very detailed notes during therapy because I know I'm going to forget everything by the time I get home. those who know me give me time and space to jot those things down. or if I know I need to remember something later, I'll write that down too. my to-do lists aren't really to-do lists, they're really just 'remember this' lists."
Teachers,flyytex,t3_frvhm9,1585611891.0,"I'm a tutor with middle schoolers right now, and this is one of the biggest things I've noticed. I've had to teach keyboard shortcuts, how to move windows around, how to type in [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com) as opposed to googling 'google docs', that kind of thing. and none of them can type! very surprising to me, growing up in the early 2000's it was new for everyone. I think with this generation, everyone assumes they're tech-savvy but really they're just...app savvy. it's definitely making distance learning difficult."
AskReddit,fl2v4th,t1_fl1ezbj,1584760717.0,"This is my job now! I was a tutor for homeschoolers and public school kids, and now that schools are closed I get it all done from home! I thought I was fucked money wise but turns out this is a valuable skill I have right now"
Portland,fl1k75p,t1_fl1j16a,1584730630.0,"ahhh interesting! I can see how that could be an issue. so if I move to different areas in my house, and I'm not getting adequate signal because my phone just literally can't, that would be why texting wouldn't be working?"
Portland,fl1ike6,t1_fkzrnnc,1584729708.0,can you explain what this means? I've never heard of this
Portland,fkzreyj,t1_fkz1096,1584678192.0,"1st, it was a refurb from Amazon that I got...1.5 years ago? Maybe more? And I'm in inner se"
Portland,fkzrbqn,t1_fkzc08y,1584678122.0,It's been happening intermittently for a couple of months now :/
Portland,fkyrcoq,t1_fkygk4f,1584654538.0,Omg THIS IS THE ANSWER I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! this very closely aligns with what I've been suspecting. Thank you so much! Gonna call and harass t mobile now... Shitty phone service is not what I need while in isolation and working remotely. Ty!!!!
BipolarReddit,fkup7s7,t3_fkjk0t,1584553583.0,"Yes, my psychiatrist thinks mine was brought on by my weed habit once I started smoking regularly. she's had a few other patients the same exact thing happened to. Can also be triggered by menopause."
ADHD,fkl3o5m,t3_fip8r5,1584297790.0,Same! I hum all the time and so does my ADHD mom. One time her dentist called her out on humming a Christmas tune while she was getting a cavity filled. I know I've def concerned some people while shopping or grocery shopping. My partner says she knows I've come out of a depressive episode when I'm humming again though :) she loves it which to me is incredible
bipolar,fkhvdya,t1_fkhskgi,1584206674.0,Yes! It's been crappy weather recently but it snowed today so I'll hopefully go enjoy that. Portland weather is tough during isolation.
mentalhealth,fkhsb1e,t3_fi2gdq,1584205054.0,"1. Brush my teeth! Sometimes I'll even have my partner bring my toothbrush to bed for me.
2. Wash my face and use a washcloth for my vulva/butt and underarms
3. Open a window, even just a tiny bit
4. Moving to a couch or the other side of the bed

Love these little things. They can make such a big difference."
bipolar,fkhlsyl,t3_fhvcpb,1584201531.0,"Yes me too, and it can really affect my sleep sometimes. My psychiatrist said it could be iron deficiency so I've been on iron pills. Could be worth looking into?"
ADHD,fkg43xb,t1_fkdv6of,1584149460.0,would love to read this essay if that's okay!
ADHD,fkfgsp6,t3_fhx5p7,1584134069.0,"I'm such a face toucher too and what has helped has been fidgets mostly, but now I've also been just holding my hands together which weirdly kind of works."
Portland,fkcewtr,t1_fk8mh2j,1584051639.0,Yes I am!! I'll be in self isolation soon and ready to phone bank. But want a sign also. Honestly it's not too late y'all!!
BipolarReddit,fk6dg84,t3_fg103p,1583899228.0,I forgot to put another nuva ring in after I took mine out and boom.....a period and the WORST MOOD SWINGS. I was just saying this to my partner. my mirena made me suicidal so now it's just my own fault for forgetting to be consistent with my birth control. solidarity with my bp uterus havers!
bipolar,fk6cxbk,t1_fk637vu,1583898861.0,this is exactly me. I would hate for anyone to see how I act when I'm alone sometimes and what goes on in my head....why would I share that with you just for you to hold it against me? but still my partner seems to forget how irritable I really am until I can't hold it in/withdraw any longer. I think it can be worse with people who think they know you really well.
bipolar,fjw3s39,t3_ff1zxn,1583634323.0,what app is this? it looks so much more useful than any other mood tracking I've tried. hope you muscle through this the best you can!
NoStupidQuestions,feexz4m,t3_eos1c8,1579043667.0,"Try getting onto a cancellation list! You may be able to do a phone consultation with the therapist, then ask if they contact you if they have cancellations in a certain time range. I've had a therapist who was willing to do that with me and it worked out great."
androidapps,fab57ot,t1_fa9zs8f,1575917923.0,"I looove Google keep and use it for so many lists, but isn't organized enough for this type of data I think."
bipolar,f9o63lo,t3_e66o6h,1575497275.0,"I started it a few weeks ago yeah my skin is awful :( I feel like me and the middle schoolers I work with are the same lol. I'm also on Adderall too tho which makes me forget to drink and eat, so I don't think that's helping at all."
ADHD,f7fhxy1,t1_f5lwlyc,1573679776.0,same I'm just waiting for it to inevitably happen lol
