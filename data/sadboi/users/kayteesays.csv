EdAnonymousAdults,fdyaxos,t3_en48uo,1578777865.0,"Okay. So let's unpack this a little. 

It sounds like he's trying really really hard to support you, which means he loves and cares about you and wants you to be healthy enough to be in his life for a long time. 

Don't take his reaction to your thinspo personally: remember that you're looking at that picture with an ED brain, and he is not. He's looking at it with the brain of a boyfriend whose girlfriend just asked if he found another woman attractive. OF COURSE he is going to say no. That has nothing to do with weight, with how he sees you, or your level of attractiveness. It's 100% the relationship failsafe response whenever a partner asks if they find someone outside the relationship attractive. Whether or not it was true, wouldn't you say the same thing if he asked if you thought another guy was hot relative to him? 

Don't break up with him to prevent hurting him, because it sounds like he knows enough about your ED to want to stay and fight this fight with you. If you have other reasons to break up, then that's another story, but not wanting to hurt him in the future isn't a solid thing to stand on. 

As far as not being 'good enough' to brush with death, that's your competitive ED brain talking. Dying or being close to it is not a good thing or something you want to be good at. I totally understand it and often have the same thoughts, but you have to remind yourself that it's the illogical ED brain wanting you to be 'good at' something horrible, like having cancer or a broken arm. That's not something the rational side of us wants to be good at.
