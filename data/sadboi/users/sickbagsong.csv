EatingDisorders,estzf2b,t3_c90ab4,1562275567.0,"See the specialist, definitely. Don't pressure her into stressful situations such as eating cake at a birthday party, just be there for her. Let her know you know this is difficult and it's not about the food, it's about her emotional and physical health. Make sure she knows they're equally important.

Set meal times but choose not scary food like vegetables, salads, protein and legumes etc. Ask her on walks and maybe over time she will open up to you.

The most important thing is to strike the balance between understanding and interfering - it will be the hardest thing you'll ever do but also the greatest display of unconditional love. Make her feel supported and loved and try to make her see that food is not the most important thing in the world. These are all things I know I would have appreciated.

I wish both you and her the best of luck ðŸ’–"
