depression,fr1tk8a,t3_glueb5,1589825708.0,I feel where you’re coming from. Life does not seem worth it because eventually we will all die. I can’t do anything without thinking “ well I’m gonna die one day”.Ex: it does not matter if I pass or fail this test because I’m gonna die anyway. Maybe we can all come to some type of happiness one day.. wish you the best. 🖤
depression,fqa2cu8,t3_ghnjec,1589211569.0,I was just discussing this with someone not long ago. It is always gonna be someone who has it worse than the next person but everyone’s situation is valid and they deserve help and support.
depression,fpgy8db,t3_gd2oik,1588611636.0,🙁 when people say stuff like “at least you’re alive” I’m like that’s the problem
self,fo92ph9,t3_g16c63,1587609193.0,If you don’t wanna go don’t apply. Period
depression,fmfpnot,t3_fusftm,1586032240.0,I understand 100% where you are coming from. I was born into a Christian family and as I got older a lot of things about it started to make less sense to me. My mom is always like “ don’t worry god got it” and I respect that but it impossible for me to say okay god got it I’m not depressed anymore.
Coronavirus,fkvagb5,t1_fktp8n8,1584565282.0,Same here. I was wearing gloves a long time ago then my boss told me it would offend the customers. Now all my co workers wear them. 😂
depression,fk97z85,t3_fgxzqu,1583970590.0,I felt this in my soul. I wear gloves at work and people are like “ you got them on because of the corona virus” I simply say I’m not scared of it
unpopularopinion,fjdqlle,t3_fcsp32,1583257329.0,Very true . As a person with depression I don’t understand how or why someone wants to be depressed
Veganism,fjborh6,t3_fcma0r,1583198103.0,Me 😢
unpopularopinion,fj2ue40,t3_fb2amn,1582954322.0,Thank youuuu. I was just thinking about this earlier the only thing I really eat from most fast food places is fried so in the morning I’m stuck
depression,fj1xuym,t3_far3w5,1582930251.0,Yes. 😞 and even when I try to be active with others it just doesn’t work out
depression,fhxuoev,t3_f51oky,1581962666.0,Same. It’s become very hard for me to exist but I know my mother would go insane even though she sometimes is part of the reason I want to give up.
unpopularopinion,fhw7oly,t3_f4xlv3,1581908432.0,It’s childish to me because I never fall for it
depression,fhdflt5,t3_f2hi68,1581484842.0,Right? It’s horrible. Unfortunately everything I do just seems pointless and I can’t stop thinking about dying.
