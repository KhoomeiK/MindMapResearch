Kai and Hana's conversation felt good, it was at least some kind of closure.

Since Reo arrived, I've been smiling ear to ear, his presence is amazing. I loved the interactions he had with Vivi. And oh man, the ending, I was not expecting that. My eyes  started watering as he was talking, and as Chasing Cars started playing I couldn't hold the tears in anymore.

We'll always remember you, Yosuke."
