AskReddit,eseriy2,t3_c7agc2,1561907628.0,"I met an online boyfriend IRL. i paid $400 for a plane ticket to see him. For 2 months, i didnt spend a single cent of any of my paychecks to make sure i had enough spending money for a good time on the trip. 

When i got there, he spent all the time looking at his phone. Never wanted to go anywhere or sightsee. He never opened up to me. I would ask what he was thinking, and i got a shrug, just ""nothing"". We had a party at his parents' house for Christmas, and his mother had to remind him before the party to introduce me to people, and even prompt him to do so during. Also, my introduction was ""This is Ukul3l3"". 

He alao didn't once pay for anything of mine. Im not saying that, as my date, he was required to, but I did already spend $400 dollars, plus other fees, just to go see him. He never offered, and whenever i asked ""do you wanna pay together?"" His answer was always ""no, i can pay for myself"". For the entire TWO WEEKS i was with him, i paid for all of my own food and gifts. 

He also refused to try new foods or experiences. We went to a popular tourist spot with lots of international food. He refused to try any of it. A lot of times, i ended up eating myself while he ~~sat and watched me eat~~ played on his phone. This especially hurt when i went to a restaurant i was very excited about, and he ordered nothing but a drink that I ended up paying for.

Overall, he left me feeling ignored and unwelcome. He didn't seem to care about me. He played on his phone, refused to try new things, and generally just didn't seem to care. It really hurt the entire time i was there. I cried a lot that trip. I broke up with him there, and my parents flew me home early because i would cry every time i called and told them how miserable i was. 

Luckily, i could tell the trip was going south, so i made sure to take most pictures without him, so i have pictures from the trip that i still like, without seeing him there to remind me of all the shit i went through while there."
