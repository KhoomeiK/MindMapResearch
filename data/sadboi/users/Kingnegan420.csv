(Do not deny it I see it because I'm the same way) if death is your path (which I'm kindred to) why give satisfaction to a being you dont believe in and a machine? You will make your call and we will respect it, show life some spite over surrender if you can though. It devours daily resistance gives it heartburn."

If it takes spite or (nonphysical violence) wrath use what6it takes to trudge on.. the depression wants us to quit and die for it. Keep stepping to spit that little S.O.B."

It's hard for both parties it seems like your trying to understand so just tell it to him flat. My fiance did she has been bogged down by college and work (me too but all humans have different stamina levels) the best you can do is be honest.  We found sometimes it's just better to skip sex so neither feels the other is uninterested.  (Inc. Trolls say what you will) all anyone can do is be honest,  both sexes will see themselves as less if their partner seems bored (sorry  ma'am not blaming you or him at all) that's why it's best to skip sometime.  Self doubt can be more venomous than hemlock. But you and everyone in this world should not feel inclined to fake or pretend. Most issues can be fixed with communication."

Most southerners were dirt poor and if they could afford any slaves worked alongside them.

I'm conservative but I always love to hear other sides ita how we all learn and grow. If I don't strike your fancy I understand maam. If not I'd like to snail mail asap.

Also I'm an Irish descendant of Confederate soldiers  we probably could not be more opposed In some ways and would probably surprise each other in some beliefs we have in common. As of late I really  really  want to hear personal voices from the other sides. If nothing else we could gain some understanding of the other sides.

I'm a millennial but dammit I hate my  generation I usually prefer folk a small bit older. But I do like smart or dorky convos that have no ulterior motives. If a 30 m is too young or odd I understand but would be great to find anyone to relate to outside of my peers XD

The elite always want everyone beneath them in bondage and someone to blame. Literally both sides were being used for a few people's personal gain. I mean why did New York and Massachusetts have so many more lynchings and riots if we were the racist ones? XD there are tons of journals, diaries, and just slews of things.

CIVILWAR,f6hassb,t3_diad7l,1572841453.0,Pretty simple minded to say it was just about slavery. Every war in history has had more than one reason. I mean everyone has their opinions but there is plenty of legitimate evidence it wasnt a singular reason to fight.
