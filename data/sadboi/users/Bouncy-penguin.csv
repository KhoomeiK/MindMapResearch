The tone is different in each, but on male issues I see accusatory comments about ""what about this and this female issue""

And one very female related issue post I see comments as well about ""no one talks about male issues"" 

Female issues do get way more coverage than male issues, but that' doesn't mean we should talk about female issues less in order to talk about male issues, we should talk about both equally, by talking about male ones more and not reducing female issues.

There's no need to take away from one to make the other more apparent. Make both more visible"

He orchestrated a coupe to make his transition into power easier and possible then did his. الحركة التصحيحية basically 

All coupes since 1963 ثورة الثامن من آذار, where basically internal struggles between the Ba'ath party.

And he himself was a critical part of the party, which in the end where all orchestrated by the Party itself or rather say the head of the party which included him.
So basically he had a hand in almost every coup that happened since 1961 directly or indirectly.

The Al Ba'ath party and البعثية is in itself one of the major issues that exist in the middle east at least in Syria and Iraq and indirectly Egypt and after his rise to power he just replaced the party and,  its centralism in ever one's life and oneness with the political discourse, with a cult of personality that revolves around him and his family."

Since they started their version of البعثية, and after the fall of the Syrian- Egyptian (United Arabic Republic) 1961 they have been scheming for this.

He made the last 2 coups, his group from البعث was basically the one couping on each other since the fall

Before that between 1941- 1961 there has been a tough 5 years in between with coupes, but there was still a government and elections , that's how the country stabilized again before the reunification.

وين ٢٠٠٠ سنة قبل الرسول اخوي شو عم تحكي انت. 
٢٠٠٠ سنة قبل الرسول يعني تقريبا قبل ٣٥٠٠ سنة عم تحكي انت، اذا السومرية بسوريا و العراق  يلي هي أول لغة مكتوبة بيقدر عمرها ب ٥٠٠٠ سنة.

اللغة العربية بحد ذاتها بيقدر عمرها ب ٢٥٠٠ -٣٠٠٠ سنة، فإذا عم تقلي ٢٠٠٠ سنة قبل الرسول اخوي اللغة العربية كلها بحد ذاتها تاريخيا  لا دليل على وجودهه بهيك تاريخ أو عل اقل مو بشكل ممكن تميزو على انو عربي

اي صح من أقدم المخطوطات أو النقوش الموجودة للعربية هي بسوريا و فلسطين، بس ليعود تاريخهم لبين ٤٠٠ ق.م و ٦٠٠ ق.م مو ٢٠٠٠ سنة. 

 و عيفك عن كل هاد بسوريا و بلاد الشام كان في حركة ترجمة لكل النصوص الدينية و الغير الدينية، بفرض موضعها بين الدول، فوجود النقوش هو فقط دليل على هل ترجمات وليس أنهم عرب و بيحكو عربي.

Syria,f26eo0g,t3_dby72e,1570006242.0,"u/No_See covered most of the things, but to add on what he mentioned:

Check the [Live UA Map](https://syria.liveuamap.com), it shows you what's happening in Syria on a day to day basis, and who controls what region. It's useful in case something happens in some area, so you know to stay away from it.

My advice to you is to make sure you stay in the Government controlled areas (The one showed in red on the map), not because the Gov areas are always the safest nor because they're the best, but rather strategically because they're the ones that control all the official border crossing that the neighboring country allow people through without problems and because they're the ones that control the Airports and most of the transportation methods.

Take it from me, you don't want to be stuck in a certain area in Syria while it's waging a war against another side, I have been there, it's not pretty. Generally speaking, Syrians are nicer to foreigners than to each other and their neighbors, so you shouldn't have issues with the people unless you put yourself in that situation. (even then they'll take it easier on you cause you're not a native).

Still, I wouldn't recommend it myself either, but in case you're going to do it regardless of what everyone says, do it right, check the map every now and then, and avoid neighborhoods or areas that have lots of commotion in it. Stay in the red areas, and never, never take photos if there are Police/Army personnel or vehicle in the frame or in the direction you're pointing.

hope this helps you."

Syria,eojrstj,t1_eoj4z28,1558641988.0,"What you heard is not precisely accurate :) 
It's not just ""some of the lower classes in Syria"" that wants the Assad toppled, lots of Syrians, in general, are not fond of Assad nor the current regime and they want a change, but the people in Syria can't state that opinion publicly for obvious reasons. 
The support for the regime has never been lower in all different classes ethnicities and religious groups. Sure there are some hardcore supporters for the regime, but it's hard to figure out the actual number between the propaganda, actual supporters, fear, and people who are just trying to get by so they don't oppose. What I meant to say that it's not just ""some of the lower classes"" but there's a good number of people that oppose the government, I can't till though for percentages or numbers between the supports and the opposition. 
And there's the fact that there's no good alternative, other than every faction is working for its own benefit, there's the fact the political scene doesn't allow other alternatives to emerge.

And to answer your first question, the Kurds basically are the main faction that is pushing for US intervention.
The regime already allowed a Russian-Iranian intervention. 
(Other than the US rebel supporters), Some of the rebels oppose any intervention, and some are for a Turkish intervention (mainly in the northwestern part of the country) 

- the heavy Turkish support for those factions, is for Turkey to take control of the northern Territories near its borders or at least secure them enough - fight the Kurds (due to the everlasting conflict between the Turks and the Kurds ) and perhaps for the small enclave that the Turks own in Syria - it's basically just a tomb for one of the Ottoman emperors."
Syria,eoi1hvv,t3_brzf99,1558607194.0,"You're correct, most Syrians don't want an external intervention.

No good has ever come to a country when the US or Russia put their fingers in. Despite what all the pro-Government sheep say about the Russian intervention, that it's not the same, it was requested by the Government and so on, it will have similar consequences to a US intervention, and the effects of this can already be seen on the ground right now in Syria, where the Russian Government is ""renting"" Gas, oil fields and ports in Syria, but mainly just taking control, and deepening it's influence in all of the different  Government branches.

A US intervention, in my opinion, would have been even worse in effects than the Russian intervention, to put it in clear words in why that is, Russia micro-manage, US just gets what it wants, if the US had intervened further most likely the country would be just shattered and become a worse case of Iraq. Besides the US  has already intervened in the Kurdish-controlled territories right now, funding projects in the northern areas to deepen the Kurdish control over there, not because they like the Kurds, cause they live where most of the oil fields are :)

&#x200B;

In my perspective, there's no clear side that one can support in the Syrian conflict without there being dire consequences, other than Russia and the US, the rebels as you mentioned are scattered, don't like each other,  and lots of them are not even trustworthy.

it's just a huge mess till now, the sides that are going to survive this are clear now, but the mess that's going to be resaulted is just starting to happen."
