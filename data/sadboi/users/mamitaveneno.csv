AskReddit,fhmwfgd,t3_f3r55x,1581718895.0,It‚Äôs going to sound small but at Dutch Bros you get a free drink if you buy 10 drinks and have a stamp card. I pulled up one day before going to the ICU to see my dad. He almost died in front of me and I barely got him to the ER on time and was still pretty out of it. The guy was so kind and filled out three free stamp cards for me and gave me a free coffee. It made me cry.

I loved smoking but I care more about avoiding episodes than enjoying cannabis. I cringe now when I hear people say that cannabis helps bipolar. It does not.

ETA: I would avoid juice. Our pediatrician told us babies this young shouldn‚Äôt drink juice until much later. Try gripe water (specifically one with fennel). We‚Äôve had good luck at using it two or three times in one day if our little guy won‚Äôt go and eventually he will go! Also try sitting baby in a bouncer or swing.
