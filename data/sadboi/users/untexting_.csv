crochet,fb1f0df,t1_faxax3z,1576435967.0,"Definitely make sure you tie it off and secure it well when it’s finished!! I went through a bit of trial and error, trying to figure out the best way to do it. A lot of tutorials will show just weaving the ends in, but in my experience it tends to loosen over time. 

Also if her hair is thicker, I’d recommend using a larger hair elastic. Depending on the yarn you use, normal hair elastics can be too tight for thick hair."
