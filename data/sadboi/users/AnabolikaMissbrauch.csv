greentext,fr51q5t,t1_fr4yyxe,1589900936.0,Well if ypu dom't know how to use a knife you cpuld accidently kill someone because you hit an ateria. Maybe hit other spots that lead to heavily injuries that never fully heal. This isn't some deep shit. This is rather mpre logic to not threaten someone to kill if you're not trying to actually do it. Imagi e he has also a knife. But he pulls his knife to actually use it against you. While you were showing off and get fucked up in the second you realized that he reached you.
