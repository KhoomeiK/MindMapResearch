Every evening there is this crippling anxiety again. Have to force myself to go out and get some food. I just cannot interact normally with other people anymore. Maybe thats why i ended up in a place where i do not speak the language AT ALL so i can try and convince myself its always weird because of that. Of course this doesnt work (i'm not convinced) and i'm still spiraling down over certain situations.

OpiatesRecovery,fgl1jz9,t3_eyw7t8,1580879167.0,"I also kicked many times with dope around. Sometimes it works because you *could* do it whenever you want without the mindfuckery.. when do i have to be there to get me something through the night..fuck its late..if i'm not going now it'll be too late..and off you go suddenly.

That being said, many, probably more times it didnt work out that way and i took sth from what i had left at home. But maybe i wasnt really determined then, who knows.

Now i am 3 months clean from opies (and i had some morph and methadone around all the time).
BUT: i'm drinking and smoking too much and the occasional benzo.. its such a drag, all this. 

Good luck to you!"

Be prepared for a hoovering afterwards but Never(!) give a 2nd change because it only will get way worse. Then it is only about revenge and they can come back at you very badly.

Sometimes i'm afraid now that i am clean i will get a stroke from all that smoking lol. 
Oh well, definitely will reduce it.

And i also have kind of an alcohol habit but i find it to make post acute wd like freezing and sweating worse so i quit drinking (again) 2 days ago. Thankfully not physically dependend (which is kind of a miracle actually after all the drinking all these years)"
