DeepIntoYouTube,fqwzih3,t1_fqtt7mq,1589722089.0,"Every single day I remember that mentally ill people exist, because they’ve always existed before this video. You’re really taking her humanity away with this way of thinking/writing. I mean it’s Reddit, whatever, I don’t expect miracles out of people. But there’s a whole subset of the human population that is quite large that you are dehumanizing (remember: she votes) and at the end of the day she’s sick. She might not be sick, but it seems like she is. Maybe she did vote (and for an increase in mental health services because she can’t get access to them potentially). As someone who has witnessed and had first-hand experience navigating the healthcare system trying to get help for depression, it sure as shit is not easy to get care and help, even when you have insurance sometimes.

You don’t have to experience schizophrenia and psychosis to know what it looks like, like her. She’s sick. And also, things come in episodes, as someone mentioned she’s probably in the middle of one. Depression, mania, etc... so being episodes, they have a start and end, generally. Now, the rough part about mental illness is that when you exhibit your sickness, you might do something like put it on YouTube. You probably wouldn’t do that when your lupus flares up or anything else has an episode. And also if you had a flareup of lupus, no one would make fun of you because you probably wouldn’t appear to be socially really OFF. But alas, this is the symptom of the illness.

So it’s like a triple whammy. You’re sick, which is something you didn’t ask for or want. Your symptoms make you look like a fucking idiot sometimes unfortunately. And the nature of mental illness makes for people to be much less compassionate and empathetic towards you. I spent the time to write this comment to provide a different perspective. It’s not an attack. Just food for thought!

I’m coming up on the one-year anniversary of my severely mentally ill friend having killed herself tragically, and she experienced psychosis before committing suicide. Although she explained it to me afterwards, she was describing it while she was seeing the pink and green glowing mouth in the kitchen. I can imagine she sounded more similar to this woman than not. 

So when I look at this I’m just kind of sad that YouTube is sort of a place to be an outlet for your mental health but it’s public and it doesn’t result in getting help from people obviously can do whatever they want with it. It’s almost like a form of therapy for some people who don’t want to go to therapy. There is one woman who has made videos for like eight years and talks about being the actual Lord and Savior and Jesus Christ is a false prophet and I mean hours and hours of each day has gone into her research that the illuminati is taunting her.

“Your parents or legal guardian must have consented or acquiesced to your living away from them. Parental consent is generally required for a teen to become emancipated. This can be shown in two ways. One way is to get your parents to sign a consent and attach it to the Petition for Emancipation. If your parents sign this form, it may be easier for you to become emancipated. If your parents won’t sign this form, you maybe able to show the court that your parents have “acquiesced.” *If you are living away from home and your parents know all about this but they are not strongly objecting or trying to bring you back home to live, a judge MAY interpret their lack of action as “acquiescence” or agreement to your living arrangement.”*

I know this isn’t some great source necessarily but here’s where I found it. I hope you can get emancipated.

You know, food poisoning, stomach bugs, trusting a fart that you shouldn’t, all sorts of things like that. “So at some point, I’m fairly certain that almost every person in this room is going to poop their pants accidentally” and when they do... they get to remember that I told them! The reason I told them was because they were annoying me, as students will intentionally do. You know, as a group of 30, y’all take on like a life of your own (in high school, I’m just assuming you’re in high school or a bold middle school student I suppose). And I’m easy to mess with as a teacher, so my students take the opportunity all the time. Therefore I like to provide unappealing food for thought since it’s my job to wrinkle your brains.

askwomenadvice,foo86un,t3_g8i6w3,1587934390.0,"Just go with the wax, it doesn’t hurt that bad after the first time, you don’t have to deal with the horrible aftermath of shaving, and if you can find somewhere great to do it. It’s the best decision of my life. I call myself an Irish werewolf. Really pale but very dark hair and lots of it. Regardless, when your hair grows back between waxes, there’s virtually noneafter a while and it’s so fine that you will never feel more clean and lovely in your life. Just invest in with some really good exfoliating gloves between waxes. I mean maybe it’s not your cup of tea, but I was also terrified, and now it’s been like six years and I can’t stand going without it because I love them so much. It skyrockets my confidence sexually because I don’t know, I feel more clean because I can take care of the landscaping needs without having any actual foliage? I don’t know if any of this makes sense, I’ve been inside a lot. And yes I have a very hairy snatch now and I’m losing my mind, but all things considered, it’s not that bad. But yes, hard wax."

He checked out and didn’t communicate until it was too late. That’s what is so heartbreaking. But now that’s the first step. Make sure custody is fine, he needs to go because he chose to end it, and I don’t know that seems logical. Definitely talk to a lawyer. My heart  goes out to you."
AskReddit,foa9lz1,t1_fo9rvyk,1587642657.0,"That’s what my friend said about the sex when he started dating Melissa on meth (who I named Methlissa). I was still disgusted, because... meth? Also - this lockdown sucks but sexual chemistry can be found in other people. Knock it off and get a grip FOR SURE. Break up man. It sounds fucking terrible. I’m a goddamn woman too. So it’s not like a sexist thing. Shitty relationships gotta end."
PublicFreakout,fo84nb2,t1_fo70sps,1587589821.0,"You know what I actually heard when she said that? “ i’m really really pissed that I can’t send my kids to school or anywhere where I don’t have to deal with them 24/7, so I mostly just can’t stand being in the house with them. Because I pay taxes, teachers should be watching my kids.”"
Teachers,fo7zpe2,t3_g632ky,1587587333.0,"Or it’s not engaging enough because the kid who has chronic absenteeism issues, all sorts of home problems, regular visits with the counselor and the school psychologist, and a job that keeps them at work until midnight is sleeping during my 7:30 AM class, just like every single other class he’s in. And that when I woke him up once, he got so aggressive, he had to walk out because he was about to throw a desk... but yeah it should just be more engaging, like maybe I can undo years of like trauma with my “do now”!!!! So glad my administrators are so helpful with their observations and feedback!"

Teachers,fo7z3gz,t1_fo7ibgg,1587587028.0,"These are the same people who have told me I’m very likely the teacher who all the students hate. In reality, and the teacher that all the students love to the extent where I have to set stronger boundaries because I have such good relationships with them that they are more likely to come out to me than their parents. It’s funny how this holier than thou attitude is actually supposed to be some measure of your worth as an educator, when in reality it all seems to be extremely self-serving for those people on social media, am I wrong? It’s really not an indicator of their impact on children but rather how amazing they are as individuals."
Teachers,fo7ytaw,t1_fo6n2il,1587586887.0,"I have cried for certain students, not right now, but like quitting a job and leaving behind a kid who I know looks up to me and comes to me as a stable figure. When I think about how I left them because I had to, I feel horrible. But if people are actively crying over not seeing their kids, as if they all just perished suddenly, I agree with other people who said maybe therapy is a good option. It’s totally OK to get your validation from outside places like your career and the influence you have on young people… But if that doesn’t exist anymore and it hurts this much? Then who are you? That’s another one of my biggest issue with teaching, it’s our sole identity if we take it on as a career!"
Teachers,fo7y55q,t1_fo7dalt,1587586551.0,"I truly believe it’s a coping mechanism. Also I didn’t know how many people had to do zoom meetings once a week. I have them five days a week. But then again, I don’t teach a “traditional class” and I have already felt like I’m not doing enough to earn my salary or be there for my kids. I wonder where this state of mind was ingrained into me?"
Teachers,fo7xz1x,t1_fo6r1x2,1587586467.0,"Literally the reason that I have trauma and pain in my past is highly related to that first paragraphs mentality and how it affected me. I’m still struggling with worth as a teacher, but I know I’m not a terrible teacher. Because I struggle with and manage my mental health issues successfully, it means I don’t ugly cry when I can’t see my students for a week. I’m taking care of myself and I even got sick already, which really could’ve been mild Covid. Literally I’ve been shamed for not just fully agreeing with your first paragraph as many teachers probably know. I’ve had someone tell me I don’t belong in a classroom because I swear. As in, when the kids are not around like in my personal life. Who do people think teachers are? I’m a fucking human being. The reason I got out of “traditional“ teaching is exactly that. It’s actually hurt my mental health and I’ve been a worst teacher for the kids because of that bullshit. So I’m not even for it. If you want to deal with your type a personality stress by driving to your students houses and waving at them, go for it. I’m gonna work on myself while still being a really good online teacher to the best of my ability! Otherwise this is why I’m going to leave educational together and get into like a nonprofit or something."
relationship_advice,fo6zt8v,t3_g5wh63,1587569735.0,"As a loner who doesn’t keep people close and is happy with myself, I still live a better life having a companion than I do being alone. It’s not that I can’t be happy, it’s that there’s a ceiling. Being whole and enough on your own is amazing, then joining forces with someone similar makes for fulfillment you can’t imagine when alone. I’d rather have a relationship than a best friend bc I t serves both :)"
TwoXChromosomes,fo6nemg,t1_fo505fv,1587562934.0,"I agree with you and I wouldn’t even call it his carelessness. I would call it his purposeful ignorance. How many people get THAT into Catholicism and don’t intentionally ignore science and logic? You have to throw away all FAITH in measurable, tangible evidence and facts to do what he did. Careless? More like negligent. What’s sad is that no one will ever be held accountable for being negligent because they can hide behind their faith. Obviously I’m a pretty hard-core atheist and I very much dislike the consequences of shitty religious choices."
TwoXChromosomes,fo6miw4,t3_g5qdwz,1587562379.0,"I’m so sorry that happened. When someone’s belief and faith actually hurts you, when you don’t choose to take part in that belief system, it’s just insulting. I’m also an atheist. What happened is horrific. You have every right to be angry. It will not be the first time in your life someone’s religion has been used to try to explain away personal responsibility, and it certainly won’t be the last. Process your grief, and then you can decide how you want to move forward from here in regards to how you hold your cousin accountable. I personally might tell my own cousin that he’s using his religion as a shield from Taking responsibility for what he did. Because at the end of the day, science is how the world actually works. He was irresponsible, he put his faith before facts, and lost his parents as a result. Honestly, I’m not very forgiving when someone does that. It’s just that we’ve had way too many experiences like this over the centuries to still be this blind today. again, I’m so sorry."
