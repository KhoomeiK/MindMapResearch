depression,fkaobyj,t1_fk95c0j,1584015134.0,"lol, i told one of my parents when she asked how i was do√Øng, i told her i was feeling reaaaaaaly bad and that i wanna go on meds. She just told me it's because my house is dirty (roommates don't clean their shit and i'm not their maid) even though i told her i've been depressed since puberty and i even tried to kill myself once.
i guess she's in denial though, can't blame her. Her sister was clinically depressed and jumped when she quit her meds cause she wanted a baby. Her other sister's bipolar amd get really fucking:""i saw aliens in my window"" kinda crazy so i guess she's just afraid."
