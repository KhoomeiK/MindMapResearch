Below is a link to some other examples of seated yoga position.
[Here](https://www.verywellfit.com/seated-yoga-poses-3567037) 

Please don‚Äôt be discouraged. Correct form and good balance are not the most important part. The whole process should be a meditative experience. Relaxing. Tranquil. Focus on what feels good and your breathing. The cadence and rhythm of yoga are important. 

You want to slow your breathing and quiet your name. Focus on that more than just correctly hosing poses. Yoga is supposed to be restorative and calming. A more gentle work out, but still great for blood flow, clearing the mind, stretching, managing pain, etc. 

You got this don‚Äôt give up! Stay healthy!"

It was going around that I had gotten cut from the varsity team in the last 3 minutes of tryouts. I made JV, but i was *this* close to making Varsity as a freshman.

Well we were going to play soccer so he naturally chose the opposing side as me. I scored 5 goals on him. And juked him out quite a few times. (I played club my whole life) 

He was still bullying me and making mean comments as we were cleaning up the equipment, my PE teacher was standing right next to me. He told me I was terrible and he couldn‚Äôt believe I had made the team let alone jv.

So...I chipped (took a very coordinated kick) the ball and hit him HARD right in the back of the head. (A line drive) he tuned around and expected my teacher to do something. (She loved me, and was REALLY strict)

1. It‚Äôll be for the best, and perhaps open communication about whether there‚Äôs a future for them.

2. At worst, still good fro OP, she‚Äôll be happy where she is, and he can truly move on. 

2.5 And if she‚Äôs happy and moved on then, she is being unbelievably cruel toying with OP and dragging him along. 

You, sir, are being unbelievably rude and cruel, and are speaking out of place. There are many other comments and upvotes from other redditors who agree. 

NO WHERE, did I say just tell her, she‚Äôll leave her fianc√© for you. For fuck‚Äôs sake, you‚Äôre obtuse."

I‚Äôm proud of you, you do have your own life; she may not be able to accept or admit it, which I want you to know makes her look awfully silly to your other family and friends. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs so frustrating to be 30! (For crying out loud) and your mom still can‚Äôt fathom you a capable and independent person. 

I‚Äôm looking up to you, 30 and embracing your adult life and family, it‚Äôs validating to know this happens to people older than me too, it‚Äôs not just my young age. Please stay safe with your wonderful family. All the best, love and hugs

covidcookery,fmvcwvz,t1_fmvcd8d,1586412734.0,"The egg is your friend, crack it in like egg drop soup, or before you put the noodles in after the water is boiling, boil an egg for about 5 minutes she‚Äôll and all, take it out, add some meat: bacon, ham, shrimp, super thin beef, let it cook for 5 fish it out set it aside, turn the heat down a little.

Add a splash of Rice Miren and Sesame Oil, stir it in add the noodles. The rice miren and sesame oil are staples for dressed up ramen all the time. 

Other things to add on top: 

-green onions
-fish cake
-asparagus
-peel the egg, add it on top of the noodles and broth
-soy sauce
-hoisin sauce 
-siracha
- miso paste
-seaweed
-additional boullion cubes or stock
-whatever seasoning that came with the ramen

BAM, some healthy, hearty, ramen for a little under $10 every time. 

Invest in having hoisin, siracha, miso paste, sesame oil, and rice miren on hand. You‚Äôll be eaten for under $20 for about a month, since instant noodles are so cheap! Enjoy!!!"
