The relationship is so new, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about not acting like your truest self around him yet. He seems to just like getting a more intimate peak at your truest self by witnessing your interaction with someone you‚Äôre close to. Personally, I would take that as the opposite of a red flag. All that said, don‚Äôt do anything you‚Äôre not comfortable with! My actionable advice: talk to him :) ask for more insight on what he meant by that. And share the fears you‚Äôve shared with us. That‚Äôs the best way to understand him better, he to understand you better, quell or address your own fears, and build intimacy. Good luck!"
