BWRT is defined by Terence Watts ‚Äì the leading therapist who developed it ‚Äì as an approach grounded in science.
It uses natural psychological processes to recondition neural pathways¬†in the brain that lead to unwanted behaviour.
By stopping and rerouting the brain‚Äôs natural response to anything traumatic or not understood in its tracks, BWRT can prevent the negative outward symptoms of conditions like depression and anxiety.
It uses no¬†devices, advanced technologies or medication, but simply involves a patient and a therapist talking ‚Äì like many other forms of therapy.
Watts believes that because many physical health problems are rooted in ‚Äì or at least impacted by ‚Äì psychological problems, BWRT can also be effective in coping with the symptoms of diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and a number of autoimmune diseases.
He says: ‚ÄúThe purpose of BWRT is to give people the life they deserve, and that‚Äôs what it does.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about giving people contentment in their lives, and making them feel equal to others. BWRT does that better than any other therapy I‚Äôve ever used.‚Äù"

What's your Thoughts and point of view/opinion? Btw Lulu is my puppy

Firstly he better not dismiss it and say the text is too long 

I know I do play a part in the relationship and my flawed behaviour needs to be worked on, and I want to see someone/psychologist when lockdown ends to help me work through them and become a better version of myself, I'm sorry I can't be the person you want me to be at the moment,. 


We've spoken a lot about accepting each other fully and unconditionally, I certainly fully accept you, however I don't think you accept me, as you constantly criticize me, I mean thank you for making me aware of points I need to work on, and I'm not denying that there are a few flaws I need to work on which I will when lockdown ends, however telling me what's wrong with me constantly and that everything I do is wrong really brings me down, and I can't be there fully for you, if I'm made to feel so inadequate 

It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to see you as I'm just waiting for you to criticize me and it's a terribly uncomfortable place to be in

I know you are jelouse of the attention and affection I give/show Lulu, but if I'm made to feel like the worst girlfriend ever why would I want to give/show you the equal amount of attention/affection


You drive to me which I agree I do need to work on and I am, but you don't put in all the effort, I show up am supportive and pay for things, we wouldn't be able to go anywhere, so that's considered effort"
