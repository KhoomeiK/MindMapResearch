I totally understand you, that's why i'll never bring up my suicidal thoughts to anyone. I have such a ""nice/normal life"", I don't think I have the right to ask for help; I'm just acting like a victim, I'm a selfish monster."
SuicideWatch,fopqhdn,t3_g8qitj,1587968886.0,"In my case i'm still alive because of fear of failing.
What if I try to kill myself but for some reason I don't succeed?
The thought terrifies me.
But I agree with you"

Now i'm in university not knowing how i got here in the first place, I don't even know if i'll be capable of having a job or finish my career.
Life is so confusing, it doesnt help that i find existing boring too.
I know i'll kill myself sooner or later because the thought of living more is terrifies me."

I hate when people care for me, i don't know why but it feels disgusting so I don't think I can tell them...
They can't help me because love and support will only make me feel worse and guilty"

I tried writing before so I can actually do something productive with my ideas but my thoughts are way too fast so I gave up a while ago. I can write half of what i want to convey but is never exactly what I mean and is very annoying.

I wish my mind slowed down sometimes but i can't really control that"

I don't know how to describe it either... So I thought of it as a binary (two opposites) because is the most easy way to explain how I feel. 
I feel the same as you, my mind is always changing and going back and forth. Everyone tells me is kinda wrong to be like this... But is it really? I don't think being consistent is my nature... Thats just how i am.
Thanks for sharing this, at least i know now that i'm not the only one experiencing this ""problem""."
