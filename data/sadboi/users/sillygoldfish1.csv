babyloss,fqmlsno,t1_fqi5r1c,1589479565.0,"Ohhh I soooo completely hear you. Yes, covid is just intensifying what was already such a difficult road. And isn't that so true - you get and sense that someone says something and maybe there's even a pause where you can tell someone is collecting the courage or wherewithall to say something - but then the moment passes - and they don't and it's - welp back to feeling alone again. And my wife and I know all too well the feeling that you and your spouse can only share so much back and forth, esp in closed quarters. In our house it got to the point of a lot of teenage style shoulder shrugs hahah, but you're just trying to cope the best you can.

Yeah, I also hear you on the whatif game. I think that may just be a guy thing to a greater extent. I do the exact same thing. Your mind starts turning and you extrapolate things out and say well if we do this and this works then this would be the time when but we will need three months to line this up and so on. Ugh, totally empathize with that! If your husband ever needs someone to just bounce the dark stuff on let him know he can PM me - women , to your credit are good (or better) about naturally creating support systems - and there is often a vacuum for guys. Culture is changing but there is still the idea that guys don't talk about the hard stuff - we absorb, we are stoic, punch each other in the arm ans move on when there is all that stuff going on under the surface. so jjst would offer - i know im randomo dude on tbe internet but just offering. 

Well the one thing I can offer with certainty is that God may feel distant or angry at you, but he is anything but - but I get the why on why you would feel like that. I know when something with the gravity of something of this happens it is natural for the mind to go there and ask and cry out - whyy - what did I do wrong - why is this happening? I get it - it makes me tear up a little honestly - hurting for you going through that and having worn those feelings myself at times. 

I want to offer you comfort though, and I have had to revist the same assurances myself - repeatedly - God is on your side. He does truly know you, and isn't surprised by anything you're feeling or thinking about him. Our God is able to take anything we can throw out. For instance - the psalms are full of that - often David flip flops back and forth, almost in an OCD fashion - in one breath singing the praises of God and then in the next slamming his fist on the table and crying out saying God where are you - how much longer will I have to wait on you?!?! To do so is to be human and we have a God who created us and knows his creation. You can and encourage you to call out to him - just start talking to Him. Would love to talk about hows and not mean it in a flippant way.

I'd also mention a couple of the things that were particuarly gracious to us in the real tender time after - in that space where youre angry and vunerable - first is Matt chandler, he is a preacher but one whom i really connect with. he and tim keller are probably my two go to guys if/when im hurting. 

And this is one of the things I listened to when I needed it the most. 

https://youtu.be/N8nsNOoAgW4

Another is CS Lewis. He gets a lot of mentions on diff subs and rightfully so but he wrote a book called a grief observed, written after the passing of his wife from cancer. And Lewis was a recent convert - and its good in that it gets in the mud and the mess and the doubt.

Anyhow I have prattled on long enough. I hope that you and your husband will take me up on talking more and just airing it out. DM me - and tell me how you're both doing today. blessings to you."
babyloss,fqi1tdx,t3_frqlrh,1589388359.0,"I wanted to respond to you on this, even if it is older. You are so very brave and strong. I want you to know that you aren't alone, and I am so deeply sorry that you and your husband are having to walk this road. I cannot imagine range of emotions that you are having to process on any gievn day while somehow still going to work and going about your day.

My wife and I have a somewhat similar story - not the very same, but enough to know how isolating it can feel. 

I have spoken about it before among friends, but American society esp offers an outlet for almost every emotion, except grief. We are very poor at grief. People don't want to deal with the awkwardness and the not knowing what to say so instead of just going firward anyway, mean well, but say nothing. People just don't want to talk about it, and if they do it's for a very brief time and then it is like buck up, its a new day - when you just want to slide a knife in their heart with the anger and despair and forty three other emotions you feel in any one given moment. 

I know very well what you're speaking of in what was supposed to bring your familes closer actually cruelly creates distance. And I know personally that even though you don't wish it that way your deserved grief is so profound that there just ins't a way to overcome it in the short term.

I don't want to offer a greeting card anecdote that its all going to be okay - I just want to, for now, affirm your right to grief in whatever form it takes. And if you need someone to listen, or if your husband needs someone to listen I'd like to offer to. I know I wish someone had offered to when we were going through a different loss. 

I feel for you both. I know there will be a better day ahead, but while you're not there I can sit here with you and listen. 

I saw your post in the prayer request sub. I will be praying for you and your husband and know that personally my faith in God and his sustainment is the only thing which has pulled my wife and I through some of the times we have faced. And if you ever wanna talk that stuff too - we're here.

You're not alone and blessings to you in a sincere way."

AskAChristian,fqhfnlz,t1_fqfbhht,1589375990.0,"Thanks for the kind words in reply! I would love to chat and get your honest feedback if/when you watch any of them, but do hope esp that you get a chance to watch Keller because of how he touched specifically on almost each question you had previously posed.

The last line of what you'd previously said in your longer reply was something I think he will speak to - that hope. 

Keller is a minister in NYC, and I'm a total fanboy of his intellect in communicating deep or hard principles of faith without being like some  caricature of a preacher in a fancy suit with a handkerchief yelling Jesus at you.

David Foster Wallace was a harvard educated novelist and social commentator. He tragically took his own life after a lifelong battle with depression, but having been down that road myself I empathize with his struggle.He was an atheist, and we might obviously disagree on that, but was always drawn to his refreshing bluntness that was said in a way in which you knew he cared versus it being for the sake of scoring a point on you.He was ahead of his time and could see cultural issues keenly. If you listen to him, and realize that he died in 2008, and consider all that has transpired between then and now - he was borderline prophetic (meant in a nonreligious sense here). And he woukd repeatedly return to themes that coukd be religious, depending how you want to consider them - a Great mind.

William Lane Craig is a lil different. I think he is a great resource for the big meta questions, whereas I think Keller is much better at dissection and would love to discuss further if you ever cared to. WLC has debated any athiest of note - hitchens, harris, etc. Interesting stuff, but of less interest to me personally.

Matt Chandler is another favorite and has a crazy backstory.

I hope you have a great day."
AskAChristian,fqewys2,t1_fqebbqz,1589314968.0,"Those are very insightful comments, and I agree very much with your first paragraph and I think you're absolutely correct. 

And this might seem antiquated and sentimental in today's world, but I believe I have something that might speak directly to almost all of the questions that you're asking - almost to a spooky level (not in an arrogant hubris - I have all the answers sort of way - but in a providental, serendipitious - right place right time sort of way) And I think they're very good questions that speak to the condition of the human heart. And I hope the sincerity with which I mean it, comes through.

I think your questions point to a very deep well of empathy that is inside you, and one that cares and empathizes with those known and unknown - or else your phrasing of those things would have been different - and that's to your credit. 

Additionally, I think you round aboutly speak of wrestling with the problem of evil and suffering - and though this wouldn't directly address this, Keller does have many other lectures that do address that.

If you're not familiar with Tim Keller, he is often regarded as one of the best living Christian apologists and phlosophers - not in the vein of William Lane Craig, but to me he is simply the best. He gave this lecture as part of a university series and so it isn't a sermon. It is what I always offer first to someone who would consider themselves agnostic, but interested in Chrtianity enough to consider its merits, and would say what I would want to articulate, but in ways beyond my abilities - and I hope if you have time you would give it a listen. I think if you gibe it 10 mins it'll hook you into the whole video. And I would love to talk more. 

https://youtu.be/SD5LYJ3us0U

I say all that as pretext to say it knocked the wind out of me and I know what you're going through and I wish you comfort and peace in the coming days. Give yourself grace and know you don't have to justify any emotions you're feeling - you just process things properly, in your own due time. 

Just imagine you sweet boy/girl leaving the pain of this life and running at full speed in some warm green field of endless expanse. Making new friends and telling everyone how you were their best mom or dad, and that they will see you someday, but for now it is time to play - pain free - and only the best dinners and treats.

AskAChristian,fqcd6mu,t3_ghpv1v,1589255364.0,"With all due respect I think the question is inherently flawed. I'd ask you to produce any body of people, in any context, and show me absolute unity/or agreement. 

Whether it's a workplace, or fans of a sports team, or governmental agency. 

The differences speak more to humanity than God. We are His creation and we manifest and reason in the way we were created. 

Another way you might think of it - go back to a football game. Some people watch it on TV and others in person. The next day everyone will agree on the score, but say someone made a crucial error that cost his team the game, and another jumps in and argues - no wait you're not giving enough credit to the one who intercepted the pass - that is the meanigful thing! - and on and on - even though no pne disputes the score or who won, all the recordkeeping bits. 

That's just the way it is, and if that seems evasive it isn't meant to be. Even the things I know the best in this life - I still don't know it all. You get a few years on you and being able to admit that and operate in ambiguity isn't scary or demeaning. And we aren't meant to get it all - or we would be God l, and most certainly are not.

my two cents. blessings."

AskAChristian,fq0u4a9,t1_fq0dmro,1589037665.0,"You commonly hear things phrased and framed in this way - ""why didn't God do this"" - as if we can put ourselves in God's divine shoes and contemplate what we would have gotten right... and I find it interesting that we never stop to put ourselves in the shoes of the mortals whom we could identify with. is is because deep down in places we don't acknowledge and talk about - we are all pretty scummy and so of course we would mess it up, and lie and cheat and steal - but why isn't this perfect Holy and Just God who wanted intimacy with his creation doing exactly what I think should have been done?

I think the way people respond is insightful. We knowingly ir unknowingly project our mindsets and biases and grudges into responses as we weave a defense.

When at the end of the day our defense boils down to I who have sinned are trying to tell tbe creator of the entire universe, who holds it together with his words, how he should be running it. 

And when we consider it like God this week is your buddy Steve who is a screw up and you'd suck at being God - talking like children - never acknowledging all that God IS.

When you can't know all the reasons why your parents do something, and you might still live in their basement...or two states away, you know you can't understand all they do why would I try to get in the mind of God, or declare him wrong? I think the better play is to approach with some humility and prayer that through study you find the answer you're looking for.

God wants to know you, are you going to give him time is what I'd ask - or keep him at arms length and pretend He doesn't exist as if that solves anything?

And the last bit is - forgiving someone is different than telling them they can no longer remain in Eden. when you ask forgiveness it is with eyes on what lies beyond this life - not what we get to ""keep"" here on earth. ALL of our crap here is the stuff of future garage sales. we needn't put any undue worth in anything here."

Your last line gives a lot insight into things:

""Tbh, I think if Christianity is the ""correct"" religion, everyone will go to hell and no one will be saved.""

The good news about Christianity (and I would LOVE to discuss is more with you, and like the questions) is that you are never going to be saved by your own ""righteousness."" We all fall short - and those actions wouldn't make us 'owed' anyhow. We are, in belief, endowed with grace which we have no right to, and it is given to us freely.

We moved out of the rules based law, and into the atonement and reconcilliation with God, that we didn't have access to prior.

lonely,fp65sxl,t3_gbed7m,1588346598.0,"You speak of empathic qualities, and having those qualities is both a blessing and a burden. if I had to guess you likely ""feel"" at a very deep level. Likely you're aware of other people's energy (yes,that's not hocus pocus, but scientific in a proper context) and sense and see queues that other people don't pick up on or see. Ironically you may miss other more normative extroverted signals and social interaction - because you can be off in your own head (conscious or unconscious). If you're this way you probably have 1 or 2 (or small group) of really good friends that ""get you"" and maybe you never stopped to consider the whys because it's just your wiring. I know it was that way for me. i spent my first 20 yrs or so in a naive sort of state - figuring everyone else was similarly wired, more or less - but not knowing that most people didn't ""feel"" in the same way.

And you likely have a rich inner life that other people will simply blink back at you, if you ever tried to articulate the capacity of. You might bore very easily with small talk because that's all surface nonsense and you wanna (self-aware or unaware) go deep or go home. And because other people aren't as often wired that way you feel like you stick out as not like everyone else, or worse feel invisible - and you just feeeeel that.

And then when you do find someone like that it feels like kismet. What I would offer is that we are in a sense strangers in a strange land. if you are from the US esp - we live in a world that is dominated by extroversion - that rewards and encourages it. in class there may be a participation metric, and workplaces reward aggressiveness and extroversion and I'm sure that is self evident. 

I would offer a couple bits of encouragement. You're not odd. if you are sensitive - you have the capacity for the very best that life has to offer - and in a real sense it's like a lowkey superpower that has to be worked like a muscle. it can and will overwhelm you and be a burden unless it is finessed and tuned into being plugged into its best use. and some of that is having the intentionality to do some self discovery work - and to that end I'd mention 3 things. 

1. check out this youtube Ted talk by Susan Cain, on the power of introversion - and our quiet power. this will feel very familiar most likely and at least for me I wanted more.

https://youtu.be/c0KYU2j0TM4

2. back when i first listened to it - her full audiobook was on yt but you could pick up her audiobook and/or paperback. it is well worth your time. it might open a door that's never been opened before - personally I got so much out of it. It is amazing, and if you want a primer she has s lot of content of yt that will feed your soul.

3. This is less used in clinical settings but nonetheless verrrrry useful and affirming. take the free personality test on 16personalities.com

takes about 20 mins but it is spooky accurate, and it then will detail a summary of what vocations you might find rewarding and what partners you might most naturally align to. I didn't find this until I was in my early 30s and wish so badly that I'd found it in my teens or 20s.

Christianity,finzjl4,t3_f8qfql,1582573352.0,"Praise God. The entire Christian life is the receipt of blessings we do not deserve, including the very best of it all - we have just right to stand before God blameless and HOLY, not through any of our own work or merit - but through the grace of God, delivered to us in his Son who died for us all.

When you read thaf outside of belief it sounds hokey, corny, insincere, etc. And when you hear it from inside the faith - as a recipient of what we have no claim to - it is truly the GOOD NEWS. 

When you feel unworthy, great - welcome to the body of Christ. We all struggle, everyday.

I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. GOD is GOOD. 

I would say that while you search for a local church, I would pass along a couple of guys who have bouyed me to the Lord in good times and bad.

Tim Keller and Matt Chandler are two leaders who I believe are carrying the Lord's words to us. 

They both have tons of stuff on youtube. 

They are thoughful, intelligent and can take you to the deep end of the pool if that's where you'd like to go. 

May God continue to bless you. I will pray for you sincerely, and call out to God (not symbolically - but literally) to draw you nearer to him. 

If you need anything at all please reach out. Love in Christ."

PrayerRequests,fgy5u2c,t3_f0rmr2,1581179784.0,"Brother, here is the thing - I feel you. I feel you. God feels you. I went through a very dark season in my early 20's and was hopeless. I was finishi g college, but going through a doozy of a depressive season that almost got the best of me more than once. 

I just want to give you a feeling of hope, and knowing someone gives a crap. I don't know you, but I know you - if that makes sense. 

Maybe your anger towards God has been there for a while and you feel distant because you haven't been in conversation with him the way you were when you were a little kid. 

I would encourage you with a couple of things. If you have weight issues and a crazy family - and don't have a lot of space to yourself - you get out and just walk the block a few times, or if there is a trail nearby hit that. Little by little you stretch that out, but dont focus on using it for weight loss, but on you tine to yourself. Many, many great women and men used solitude to work on creative issues internally.

Doing so will serve 3 things. You get some private time where your crazy family isn't on you. Two you're getting some exercise and feeling the world a litle. Three you can say i will use this time everytime I go to falk to God while I walk - so no one will interrupt you, no one will belitte you - youre out making it happen and talking to God. And during that time too you can think about what you want in this life - for your future. I personally use it every single day as my self time to focus and think about what comes next.

Its very easy to get in a loop where you feel the world and everything in it, and most of all God who is letting it happen, is against me. Pray that out to God. Our God is able. Our God is greater, our God is stronger. He wants to hear from you.

I sincerely believe in you and that you can tackle the world. If you give this a month of walking daily(or close to) and talk to God while, you willllll catch fire and see things more clearly.

Blessings to you friend. I am cheering for you, believe in you and will pray for you."
