depression_help,fqdjpfc,t3_gi94wu,1589291118.0,Not at all. It’s very common when you have depression. For me it’s one of the first signs I’m going through a depressive patch.
Anxiety,fpo4zrl,t3_geiyn7,1588778471.0,Yes!
depression_help,fpo4s59,t3_gekahr,1588778364.0,Very much so. Lack of sleep sets my depression off big time
lonely,fpo4njl,t3_gehgxj,1588778299.0,Usually those who ghost are going through their own struggles which is why they ghost. Sometimes ghosting is wrapped up in terrible self esteem and feel like they aren’t worth a partner. It’s usually an indicator of their issues not yours.
depression,fpd2s5x,t3_gcmyix,1588518620.0,Unless you are toxic person ghosting is a very cruel thing to do to someone. Usually when someone ghosts it’s not about you it’s about them and their issues. It feels like it has everything to do with you but it really is to do with them.
CPTSD,fpd01lu,t3_gclrki,1588516886.0,Yep and got myself pretty obese as a teen. I was eating to deal with the crap my parents were putting me through. To combat my obesity my mother then starved me.

CPTSD,fouorav,t3_g95rqj,1588087876.0,Yes I get upset when someone doesn’t like me and didn’t realise it could be due to childhood trauma and bullying. I immediately think of someone doesn’t like me it’s my fault some how. I try and tell myself “ no one will ever like everyone so it’s normal not to like some people”
insomnia,fnp3fhs,t3_g2vz5p,1587138533.0,I would try podcasts or meditation apps to see if it help. Sometimes if your brain is distracted then it won’t go into panic attack mode plus the podcasts and meditation will help relax you with any luck too

AvPD,fnnjwad,t3_g2m1ut,1587094096.0,Don’t back out! I haven’t been but my friend did and they said it was the best thing they did. It’s like a group therapy session but you are like in school classroom and you learn lots of ways to cope with things. You take lots of notes.  Don’t forget everyone will be super nervous too because no one will know what to except.
depression,fnnjlkp,t3_g2ojjp,1587093896.0,"I’m so sorry to hear your father said that to you. I have s father very much like this and I have very low contact with him. It’s much better for my mental health not to have him in my life much. 

I too wanted a great daughter father reunion but I’ve had to accept my father isn’t a nice person. I had to accept that I’ll never have a normal parent child relationship with him and we won’t ever be a happy family. It was heartbreaking to realise I don’t get the father that most people get nor will I ever have a nice happy close relationship with him because he’s not capable of that. It took me a long time to mourn the loss of that actually."

CPTSD,fnndfj3,t1_fnncyvi,1587089834.0,Same. I’m going through a very awful time and friends who I had supported over the years haven’t seemed to give a shit. It’s incredibly disheartening on top of everything else I’m trying to deal with
CPTSD,fnnct0h,t3_g2nkp9,1587089435.0,"I’ve been thinking about this actually 

Yeah, though I do wonder if it’s because we know how it feels to be depressed and alone so we try to help out others to make them feel better so they don’t have to feel like we do. I also wonder in part if we spend time helping everyone it’s because deep down we are also people pleasers and this is just another form of people pleasing. I also think that when you help others it distracts you from your problems 

Adding to all that I wonder if some of us also look strong because we have been taught not to show weakness so therefore no one expects us to need help. Some of us are taught vulnerability is weakness and have a hard time showing it 

Or everyone we have been helping are all about them and selfish."
Anxiety,fnlbfat,t3_g2eyfc,1587050556.0,I used to have this. It’s another form of anxiety. Unfortunately the best way to deal with it is to force yourself to go anyway. The more you avoid it the bigger your fear will get about going to the shops. Sorry there isn’t an easier solution.

lonely,fnlabhi,t3_g2dbl2,1587049977.0,Oooffff I hate it when people say you don’t need anyone. To a certain degree they are right.

depression,fnl7w6k,t3_g2axl3,1587048689.0,When I’m really bad the thought of dating someone revolts me. I think because I’d hate for them to see me in a depressive state. All a sudden you are vulnerable and your worst side is showing. I worry that no one could possibly love me or would want to be with me when I’m really bad.
Anxiety,fnl7fg5,t3_g2dcew,1587048440.0,"I’m the opposite. I love storms. I go out storm chasing. Admittedly I live in a country with no tornados and think if I did stormy weather would frighten me. Love the rain too and grey days. 

The heat however can sometimes trigger off my anxiety."
AvPD,fnl6hkj,t3_g1woq3,1587047928.0,"I was reading a book called the body keeps score I think. It says something about how a lot of people who suffered trauma as a child are overweight or have eating issues. 

I think there is a whole range of self medicating things people do to cope including eating, drinking, doing drugs, becoming workaholics and those who overbook themselves so they are always doing something, and even becoming workaholics to fill their voids."
Anxiety,fna17op,t3_g0g0v6,1586789031.0,Yes because increasing your heart rate feeling like you are having anxiety or about to have a panic attack. It took me a while to get used to this feeling of being uncomfortable. Honestly I still don’t love doing cardio much because of how it makes me feel
KindVoice,fna0qy0,t3_g0f5be,1586788767.0,To have a partner that loves me dearly and I them to be able to travel again ( with said partner and make amazing memories together) and to have a successful career which I love that pays enough I don’t have to be worried about bills constantly

CPTSD,fn9bbnw,t3_g0cs4k,1586766284.0,"Attachment forms in childhood to your parents. How your parents interacted and treated you in your early years sets your attachment style. 

I highly doubt anyone on this forum would have a secure attachment style. I would think most would be anxious or avoidant which was shaped by the interactions you had as a child. In fact your avoidant attachment style is part of your survival mechanism you have adopted to keep you safe. You avoid getting close to someone for fear of them hurting you, abandoning you or them becoming valuable to you which triggers off a fear that they will leave you and you will get hurt. 

Best thing would be to start doing some internet research on avoidant attachment. Also probably good idea if you can to see therapy too. You can move from avoidant to secure but it can take a fair bit of work. Don’t let this put you off it’s more than it’s not something you can do overnight it’s a slow process but it’s very much worth it."
CPTSD,fn99try,t3_g0cq6i,1586764631.0,"Yes. I believe it’s because when we stop for the day, our brains aren’t distracted anymore.  Without distraction your thoughts run free to invade your mind."
CPTSD,fn9743i,t3_g0bug9,1586761751.0,"One of my parents loves to tell me how much I was a truely awful teenager and how rebellious I was. 
 
Honestly I was just trying to survive. I went out and drank lots because my home life was so awful and I was trying to escape that. I am usually the person who tries to be good and I don’t think I’m much of a rule breaker even now after all these years. I think most of the fights would be about my freedom and around me going out. 

What’s also infuriating is that my parent blames my behaviour all on me and it’s like they refuse to see the abuse they put me through that contributed to me apparently being an awful teen and wanting to be out and not in the house."
depression,fn6i8k2,t3_fzuo5t,1586699979.0,I thought you could go to your doctor. Therapists in my country can’t prescribe you medication unless they are a psychiatrist which is a dr who specialises in mental health. They aren’t usually talk therapists and usually just prescribe medication
depression_help,fn6hrtp,t3_fzmf83,1586699636.0,"Unfortunately it can take him and there is no easy fix. I’m in a bit of a relapse atm but again relapses are part of recovery 

Therapy, exercise, eating well, getting enough sleep, being compassionate to yourself, create a mood diary, meditation, journal and if you want to medication. 

I’d also go to your dr if you can to get your bloods tested. Sometimes if you have a lack of vitamins d or have hormonal problems then that can set off your depression too."

depression,fn6gf2r,t3_fzu8eq,1586698578.0,"Yes it can feel like that. 

You can also be super tired, eat everything or end up eating nothing. You don’t have any motivation, you have no energy, you sleep a lot or you get insomnia. You can stop showers or looking after yourself. You can become angry."

lonely,fn3at7q,t1_fn3acmu,1586616824.0,"Definitely not maybe :) the fear runs deep in these people. Fear of not being good enough, fear that they will get left, fear of having feeling and getting attached, fear they like you more than you like them. So much fear. 

Boredom and annoyance is probably there too but more in the earlier part of dating not so much in a relationship.

It sucks all the same. Plus if they can’t be bothered to communicate with you then you probably don’t want to have them in your life"

I often feel lonely when single but I’ve also dated someone who made me feel very alone within the relationship. Having someone you love feel like they don’t give a hoot about you is far more damaging then feeling lonely when single. 

I suspect a lot of relationships will fall apart during these crazy times when you have to quarantine and hang out with your partner"
CPTSD,fn33cz9,t1_fn31kv3,1586611784.0,"I like finding something that speaks to me or inspires me and then go about creating it. I love the process of forming ideas as much as shooting. I’m lucky I have friends who let me shoot them that are cool with letting me shoot them and they are patient enough to let me learn on them too. Having said that sometimes I go out with a specific idea in mind but it usually is a very organic process on the day between the models and I and we see what takes our fancy. 

I use art and my photography as an escape. You have to concentrate a lot so it stops your mind from wandering. I like creating too because as a kid I lived in my head because it was better than reality. My work has a soft romantic side to it too which I think comes out when I shoot because I’m probably a bit too shy and i find it very vulnerable to admit I’m soft and romantic. 

I usually shoot nudes and females as I also like the idea of empowering them in their beauty. I like lifting them up and making them feel good about themselves. This harks back to having depression myself and feeling ugly and very disempowered. Everyone has their own beauty (unless you are a narc or toxic person) because beauty radiates from within not without."
