quit_vaping,fp7phb8,t3_gbl4c8,1588375119.0,"Itâ€™s not going to harm you physically, your body just wont be comfortable with these changes at first so it will be stressful. Iâ€™m currently 9 days vape free, 5 days nicotine free. I used a nic patch for the first 4 days then leaned off of them because i felt okay. I was vaping for 2+ years. I didnâ€™t want to use gum because Iâ€™ve heard of people who get reliant on the gum and either never get off of it or canâ€™t for months. My advice for you is to just constantly keep yourself distracted. I drink something, I snack, I play videogames, and I read. I also avoid things that I associated with vaping like sitting at my desk or driving."

Iâ€™m already on Wellbutrin but it hasnâ€™t really seemed to help the depression yet. Just increased the dosage so hopefully it works out. Iâ€™m just scared because I couldnâ€™t imagine living the rest of my life feeling like this. Would definitely not be functional in society. Do you have any tips for getting yourself out of the depression?
