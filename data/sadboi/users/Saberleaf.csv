As for ""roles"" one of my exes was MUCH taller than me and I looked way more feminine than her. But I'm naturally more dominant in my relationships so stuff like planning dates or bringing flowers etc. were by choice on me. My point is, ""assumptions"" are based on behavior rather than looks."

It also seems strange that you can't decide between this being an overlook by the marketing manager and intentional character re-design. It's either one or the other.

Yes, it's normal in game development that they decide to downgrade something for reasons but usually it's extremely looked down upon by community.

But, dude, it's just a character design in a game that already took years to make. It's not completely different game mechanic. No one is asking them to redo the entire game. People are simply complaining about a character design downgrade. No need to make a mountain out of a molehill. If it was a mistake, they ought to fix it, if it was a character model earlier, then all they need is to replace it.

They are already postponing the game until next year, I'm pretty sure doing a single remodel based on what THEY promised earlier is not that much to do. If they don't choose to do so, I don't think anyone is going to remember it when it gets released.

You don't protect people by telling them who they can date and punishing them for behaving like adults. You protect them by ensuring that people who can harm or assault others get punished.

If they behave unprofessionally then I would approach them about it but firing good workers over one decision in personal life that's perfectly legal doesn't look like a sustainable business model.

Being told we are wrong, going to hell, shameful, might get fired, aren't equal to heterosexual people and listening to that every day while growing up messes people up.

If I'm with someone who has a history of traffic accidents or is new to driving, I'd politely request they follow the speed limit or drop me off. But saying they're a dangerous driver because they drive 5mph over limit where everyone drives 10+ and they drive that route every day, doesn't show that I'm evaluating the situation reasonably.

I honestly don't think there's THAT much higher chance of these relationships being abusive in general. It all depends on the people involved and their reasons for being in the relationship.

Relationships are uneven in every single sense. You have no relationship where both parties are equal. They have different job positions, different income, different personality, different level of confidence and selflessness, different level of maturity, different relationship experience. There are many abusive relationships that people who are abusive don't even realise they are and don't want to be (I had a friend in a relationship like this). Many people take what they learned from their parents who might not have had healthy relationships.

It's not wrong to watch out for red flags about your friends but if you know the ins and outs of the specific relationship that's exactly what it should be evaluated on. Not shallow premises. And this is exactly what we see in shows, the details.

We know Julian is really bad with women and tends to be driven by emotion rather than logic. Meaning he can come strongly which is causing trouble and it's something he needs to watch out for. That was the point of the episode with Serena. But it's not like he did it intentionally. Was it messed up? Yes, that was the entire point. Does that make his relationship with Melora messed up? No. Does that mean he can't date anyone on DS9 because he's the head doctor? Of course not.

It's strange that no one is looking down on Crusher/Picard pairing even though they have the same doctor/patient dynamic. It's almost as if maturity of people involved was more important... hm..."
startrek,fqu0443,t1_fqty8k7,1589649431.0,"No, I don't get it. You say it's not that there's higher than non-zero chance of abuse and then you say exactly that. I've seen many relationships that Reddit would call abusive and while they were unhealthy, it was in the exact opposite direction as you would assume and also many that were healthy. People don't follow logical guidelines.

I had a boss (man) who was dating his employer (woman). Poor woman, right? Must have been difficult on her. Well, no, he was doing exactly as she wanted and we knew exactly what we would go over on the meeting on the next day because it was whatever she was complaining about. Was it unhealthy and abusive? Yes, but it wasn't the ""weaker one"" who was abused, it was the boss who was likely getting hell at home.

Likewise, I had a colleague who was dating his employee, they were living together and working together on the same shift. No one was abusive in this relationship. They divided job and personal life so strictly, that neither would bring up the other moment they punched out or the moment they punched in. I did ask them if they had trouble dividing it and both denied it because they hated talking about job at home anyway and this provided a bit of extra safety against that.

I don't know that many doctors but I have some in the extended family and all of them are willing to check them if family members need it.

Life is not black and white. Someone with power can be so in love or trying to make up for it that they end up being abused.

I'm not saying there are no abusive relationships, I'm just saying that relationships should be at all times judged for what's going on in them rather than what you think at a first glance. Yes, if the boss is abusing his assistant, it should be addressed. Not on the grounds on him being the boss and sleeping with his assistant but on the grounds of whether she's doing it willingly or not and who's using who in the dynamics.

Yes, it's important to look out for your friends and colleagues to ensure nothing harmful is happening to them but it's wrong to disregard their opinion completely because you think their relationship is simply unhealthy period.

EDIT: I thought what you did until I had a teacher who was in an abusive relationship with his former student. They married a while after she graduated. She was giving him hell and a lot of people acted as if he was the bad guy because he totally must have forced her into the relationship. I saw them together a few times, he would bring her stars from the heaven if he could and she was absolutely demanding them. Other people who knew them both would describe it as him being totally in love and her just pushing him around because she knew she could. It was painful to see that and to see how people judged him."

My family is very strongly religious so being gay was out of the question and I knew one thing my entire life, I wasn't into men. So, if being homosexual wasn't a possibility and I wasn't heterosexual, it must mean I was asexual.

Terrible logic, I know, it took me a while to make peace with the fact that I might be plain boring lesbian. I still think I might be aromantic or maybe I'm just too guarded but I never had crushes. When I do love a girl, it's very deep, very strong and doesn't leave easily but it doesn't have any symptoms of a ""crush"" and I need to be in a relationship with them or want to pursue it for that to happen and I need to know them really well.

Yes, Bashir handled his relationship with Serena badly, as I wrote before and as I repeat now.

That being said, the entire point of his relationship with Serena was that it was doomed because he hurried too much. IMO, he should have waited until her treatment was completed or until she was moved to another doctor because she never had this much awareness about her life and she deserved some breathing room. But that was specifically pointed out in the show as well, so yeah.

With Melora he started the relationship and THEN started the treatment so I fail how in that world is that messed up. Because he wanted to help the woman he loved? Yeah, what a creep. Besides, she was the guy in the relationship anyway.

This strange obsession with no relationships within occupation is very modern American culture. I've never heard anyone ever complain about this where I live. Quite the opposite, people want their close ones to be their colleague, boss, doctor, whatever. The only case where I think it could be problematic is if it was psychologist/psychiatrist (since the patient can have unhealthy obsession rather than love) but even there if you quit the doctor-patient relationship I see no problem. The point is that neither party is abusing it so then it simply goes down to two adults being in a relationship and I honestly don't understand what's wrong with that."

They made this very interesting moral conundrum that western media have completely ignored in favour of one or the other and the it throws it out of window because the main character doesn't like either. The main character, as is a habit in shows, gets the girl as a reward for winning, character development gets conveniently pushed aside and plenty of interesting plot points get completely swept under a rug because it would tarnish the happy ending they wanted to tell. Except for the Big Bad the show resolved absolutely no issue that they brought up (I'd argue that they left the world in greater chaos than before) despite having a 3 part grand finale.

PrincessesOfPower,fqsuqs9,t1_fqrybhj,1589619548.0,I choose to believe that this is actually future rather than Adora's pipe dream. The entire sequence of events doesn't feel like a daydream (why not imagine the ball itself?) but more like a premonition of what can happen.
Fantasy,fqsubpj,t1_fqq6iq8,1589619120.0,"Because the show is not over and the MAIN villain is alive? Seriously, you're just being irrational here."
AmItheAsshole,fqsly5k,t1_fqrkpwb,1589611112.0,"That I can agree with. Lacking qualifications is a problem that would eventually make not only her but also her boyfriend look bad and damaging their reputation. Though, we're in financial crisis, I don't blame her for grasping at straws to get a job."
AmItheAsshole,fqrezc5,t1_fqqgxe3,1589583039.0,"When I was a kid I asked a friend why she smelled badly all the time. My mom criticised me for it when I talked to her about it and told me never to do it again. Did I do it to hurt her? No, I genuinely wanted to know. Did I think it would hurt her? No, to me it was a simple question because I was a kid.

Kids don't realise the consequences of their actions until they learn them. They don't know some words hurt others until someone tells them or they experience it on their own. That's what childhood is about, learning."
AmItheAsshole,fqrc36x,t1_fqr7gme,1589581469.0,"It's courtesy to schedule important meetings ahead of time, not throw people into them. What if GF was just dealing with a large issue in a family or with a friend. What if she was distracted and in the middle of doing something else.

If the boss or anyone called me to ask about me, my first reaction would be to schedule a specific time to talk about it. Not everyone is available 24/7 and it absolutely cannot be expected of anyone. Never mind be 24/7 ready for an interview. People have a life even if they are unemployed."
AmItheAsshole,fqrbmq2,t1_fqr3su4,1589581230.0,"That's you and congrats for that but not everyone is like that. I have social anxiety and I worked several years as a contact person for other companies (customers) even got praised by my boss and got several surprise bonuses. So, I'm pretty good at phonecalls and bullshitting my way through. But there is nothing I hate more than unexpected phonecalls. Whenever a headhunter calls me and asks me about ""myself"" I immediately tell them I'm too busy and reschedule. Because otherwise I panic, I freak out, it gets difficult to organise my thoughts, I keep demolishing basic grammar and I get my dates all wrong. 99% of times this has happened and I didn't reschedule I told them complete bullshit in my panic and kept mixing up sentences.

There is a reason why job interviews are scheduled. Stress and high stake situations make a lot of people freeze up or give them a total black out. That very same person can be actually very good at customer service. It's a perfectly normal human reaction to an unexpected situation."
AmItheAsshole,fqrbive,t1_fqr8dwb,1589581172.0,"The point of a ""surprise call"" is that you don't expect it, hence, can't prepare for it. You can't do ""basic research"" when you have no idea it will be required of you.

Congrats, you're one of the lucky people who can react well to surprise but not everyone is like that. heck, most people aren't like that. That doesn't mean they're doing something wrong or something is wrong with them, it's simply how they operate. And that's exactly why you need to schedule interviews."
actuallesbians,fqq3ywy,t3_gk9lyq,1589558994.0,"Personally, I find them to be fun. And no, I don't think all lesbians are switches, I strongly prefer to be the dominant/giving one so I strongly relate to top/bottom labels. I feel semi uncomfortable being on the bottom/receiving side. I have no idea why but it just feels more boring than to be topping a woman."
AskReddit,fqq2sys,t1_fqq0qm7,1589558426.0,"Seriously! You can literally show th entire boob but censor nipples only and it's OK. Like, what the hell do they think showing nipples is gonna cause? Everyone has them!"
PrincessesOfPower,fqq0irb,t1_fqpz5fk,1589557302.0,"That would make sense and it would explain why First Ones were so magic hungry and why they're all gone now. I imagine if they made more enemies, She-Ra being gone would start a headhunt on all First Ones."
PrincessesOfPower,fqpv1fl,t3_gjrfsb,1589554490.0,"As much as I wasn't onboard Catradora before, I am now. Though I do find it a bit fast of a development that they went from trying to kill each other to confessing love in one season would have honestly preferred if they ended it on Adora deciding to give Catra a chance than outright saying she loved her. I dunno, after everything that happened that felt a bit forced.

But other than that I loved it and I loved how open this show was about same-sex relationships. This is a good time to be alive and gay. I never thought I'd actually see something like this done in a cartoon. 

Storytelling was superb, animation seamless and truly a sight to behold. My favourite part was the She-Ra space battle and I love how the magic looks rainbow-y. Partly for the gay implication and partly because not having a set colour makes it look otherwordly and ethereal.

I also really loved how the show combined magic and technology, I wish there were more shows that did something like this.

Also Seamista. Entrapdak and Glimbow are a thing and neither Spinerella nor Netossa died which is absolutely incredible. All of my ships came true!

Overall, I'd rate it 9.5/10. The only thing I would have changed is that I would have start setting up Catradora in the previous season or end it more subtly, it needed some breathing room."
PrincessesOfPower,fqpobq1,t3_gjrf7q,1589550850.0,"What I really appreciate about this episode is that it shows that despite wanting to be better people, both Catra and Shadow Weaver are very conflicted and still the same people as they were before. They  didn't magically turn good but that doesn't mean they're evil. They just don't know how to be different because they were always like this. I really like that, it shows that changing takes time and there's no magical cure.

That being said, Shadow Weaver is a bitch and she should burn in hell. Adora obviously needs Catra in her life because she needs someone to stop her from constantly sacrificing herself."
PrincessesOfPower,fqpktlm,t3_gjrf33,1589548730.0,"Perfuma really annoyed me in this episode but I laughed aloud when she got attacked. I mean, it's sweet but really annoying. 

It feels like Prime is constantly one step ahead. I really love him as a villain, he's fun.

I'm glad Bow's dad's were actually useful rather than just side characters.

This season has incredibly good writing. The heroes win but the stakes and tension don't lower. Quite the opposite, the more wins the more concerning it is what Prime will do next."
PrincessesOfPower,fqphsc4,t1_fqphnu1,1589546729.0,I tried doing that too but I get so into the episode that I write one line at the beginning and then suddenly it's over and I wrote nothing.
PrincessesOfPower,fqphiqc,t1_fqpa0qp,1589546543.0,"I haven't seen the episode yet and I love how this post is all ""OH NO"" and ""STOP, PLEASE"" just with different characters. This should be good. I love your reactions btw. They make my watch all the more fun."
PrincessesOfPower,fqph8lx,t3_gjrey4,1589546342.0,"Wrong Hordak is way cuter than right Hordak, can we keep him?

It's great to see She-Ra operating from a position of power and that the people are starting to trust them again. 

Still waiting for Glimbow and Entrapdak."
PrincessesOfPower,fqpfeo3,t1_fqpfb1p,1589544975.0,They can't see this otherwise they will be turned gay! What will I do then? My entire retirement plan would fall through!
PrincessesOfPower,fqpf8iz,t1_fqpevke,1589544845.0,Can you imagine that? How would I explain it to my children?
PrincessesOfPower,fqpeymx,t3_gjreuh,1589544627.0,Adora blushing and smiling at Catra is so cute! Melog is the best thing that happened in She-Ra. The sneezing contest between them was too cute to be real. This episode has warmed my heart.
PrincessesOfPower,fqpcxko,t3_gjrepo,1589542939.0,"Perfuma is so beautiful and adorable! I will sell a kidney to have at least one single date with her.

Netossa and Spinerella are relationship goals. Even with all the brainwashing.

So many people are taken over. This is really intense! The stakes are much higher than I expected."
PrincessesOfPower,fqpbeoo,t3_gjrekt,1589541568.0,"I love Catra's sass. This season will make her my favourite character. She's so awfully relatable.

Though, I'm very happy that Catra's anger wasn't just resolved with a blink of an eye.

I still hate Swift Wind. I was hoping that him not going would lower his screentime but alas...

Wrong Hordak is hilarious.

Prime is terrifying. He just casually enslaves being by taking their free will. The reveal at the end... Damn... 

The adventure sidestory was fun, I really enjoyed Micah trying to please Frosta who was annoyed by it. It's a nice change of pace among the seriousness.

True She-Ra is BRUTAL. She just casually handled entire space battle on her own with just a sword. I find it suspicious that Prime claims to have destroyed all First Ones if they had this magic. Only if there is really just one She-Ra and she disappeared into the time portal. That must have been game changing for the war."
PrincessesOfPower,fqp9wwb,t1_fqp4032,1589540177.0,I know right? It starts with a kiss on screen and suddenly they start destroying our traditional families. The horror!
PrincessesOfPower,fqp9hiz,t3_gjrefc,1589539771.0,"This episode was very hard to watch. Poor Catra. She lost absolutely everything, including herself and her own will.

Prime clone as a pet is hilarious though.

I love the new She-Ra style and I love love that Adora she-ra'd for Catra. Infinite hearts!

""Hey, Adora"" at the end broke me. My life will never be the same again."
PrincessesOfPower,fqp7tvh,t3_gjre9p,1589538123.0,"Glimbow relationship drama, I wanted and needed this so much! It's also nice to see Bow be more serious for once. I ship them hard."
PrincessesOfPower,fqp61k7,t3_gjre4s,1589536298.0,Catra - Glimmer dynamic is awesome and Prime's cult is seriously creepy. I love how hair stays out of the space suits.
PrincessesOfPower,fqp5bx9,t3_gjrdyy,1589535569.0,"Geez, Prime is Voldemort level of villain. His speech sent chills down my spine, it's so well written and with such a perfect voice. Entrapta is the cutest.

I hate Swift Wind. Lol at princesses planning together. Entrapta fangirling about space is so relatable. I love how everyone is like ""We need to save Etheria"" and Entrapta is ""Superadvanced technology! Space!"". And then she flirts with the robot.

Perfuma is so adorable though, she's trying so hard to be relevant. 

I hate Swift Wind, I'm so happy he's staying behind. Though I hope Glimmer and her dad will have a reunion."
PrincessesOfPower,fqp3vd2,t3_gjrdui,1589534079.0,"Adora breaking down about not being She-Ra was sad but I'm glad she learned to fight with others. I feel like this will be important for her sense of self in future episodes.

And Prime seeing right through Catra was delicious."
PrincessesOfPower,fqp0s67,t1_fqozviw,1589530964.0,Maybe you would be surprised. It's definitely not most that's supportive or doesn't care. Most of the world is still leaning on the homophobic side.

PrincessesOfPower,fqozi7u,t1_fqoi0xv,1589529734.0,I want Adora to get the largest sword in existence and Catra the biggest scratching post.
PrincessesOfPower,fqoza9t,t3_gk1am8,1589529523.0,"Honestly, bad boy/girl getting turned to good side by a good boy/girl has to be the most overused and most popular cliche in the history of writing. Everyone and their dog loves it.

If anything, I'd say it would be even more popular because a lot of people avoid the show since gay = eww for them.

Probably the most extreme example of this I can say is Dramione (Draco/Hermione) which is one of the most popular HP ships despite having absolutely no basis in canon at all. They just outright despise each other (assault happens as well). When ATLA aired Zutara was the most popular despite having like... 1 moment in 2 seasons gaslighting/manipulation were happening too.

Reverse: Batman/Catwoman has to be one of the most, if not the most popular DC ship and she straight up uses Batman for her needs in many cases. Teen Titans had Kid Flash/Jinx who flirted together like once and the fandom went insane, shipping them above and beyond reasonability.

There's a lot more examples even in modern shows."

Fantasy,fqoxeg4,t1_fqnzkjj,1589527802.0,"You assume and lot and assign blame for nothing. Oh, and your assumption is wrong btw. Main villain =/= the only villain. The show could have had 10 villains in 3 seasons and the main villain could have been revealed in the last episode of S3. You're being awfully oversensitive."
