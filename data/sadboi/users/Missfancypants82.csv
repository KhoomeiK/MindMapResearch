antidepressants,fn2uq7a,t3_fz0pcg,1586604072.0,"Best one I’ve tried yet and I’ve been on citalopram and Mirtazapine, deffinately more energy, deffinately feeling more motivated to do things (I stopped cleaning and cooking among other things) started taking them 4 weeks ago, and without them I would deffinately be losing my shit over this corona virus stuff, but strangely enough I feel like I’m coping quite well with it. The mirtazapine made me put on weight cuz of my crazy appetite and sure enough I’ve lost a lot of that weight now too. Only slightly negative thing is it has affected my sleep slightly, but I find that if I take it early in the morning I’m ok falling asleep at night, oh and I’ve had to cut down on my coffee, because it’s a stimulant so I try not to drink any coffee after 12pm and it’s helps a lot.  Also the citalopram killed my libido totally, Mirtazapine  made it go back to normal and Wellbutrin has also maintained my libido so I’m overall really pleased to have finally found one that works for me in all aspects. Fingers crossed it stays that way lol! glad it’s working well for you too, it’s hard to find the right one."

Considering your family history and the fact that Schizophrenia generally tends to manifest itself in your late teens, I would deffinately go and talk to your doctor about it."
antidepressants,fkv8qzk,t1_fkv475l,1584564345.0,"I can concur this has been the case for me, Was on citalopram at first which worked wonders for my depression and anxiety but totally killed my libido, Mirtazapine has definitely increased by libido! But yes my appetite has increased, and yes it makes u sleepy so I take it a hour before bed.  Fine in the morning after a shower and a coffee, Only thing is it gave me A LOT of aggression and irritation for at least 2 months, I’m just finishing my 3rd month in these and I feel like that’s petering off now too. Have been thinking of asking my doc to switch to Wellbutrin because of the hunger thing, I’ve put on weight which is making me very self conscious and therefore adding to my depression."

I am actively trying to lose weight though because I’m already a little overweight, so im really watching what I eat.  I have read that it increases your appetite, but I can’t say I’ve noticed any major difference in my appetite, I assume that if I’m able resist any increased hunger pangs, then I shouldn’t gain any more weight, and hopefully lose some if I can stick to my diet lol!"

Mirtazapine_Remeron,fgm6w9t,t3_ez9ib5,1580919091.0,"Hi! I just recently switched from Citalopram to Mirtazapine, I’m on 15mg and I’ll be honest within half hour of taking my first tabIet, I  felt like I was drunk! I I just went to bed and slept for like 12 hours straight, when I woke up the next morning i still felt pretty out if it, but as soon as I had some coffee and toast,  I started to feel normal again, next day wasn’t as bad but I made sure I took it 1 hour before bed and it was fine, helps you get to sleep a lot quicker if that’s something you struggle with, then you’ll really appreciate that part.  I’ve been on it 3 weeks now and I don’t have any major issues with the drowsiness, I just make sure I take it before bed, no problems waking up the next day either, that calmed down for me within a few days. 

I do however have some issues with agitation and aggression which I definitely didn’t have before.  I feel irritable all the time, although I’m told this could side effects of the transition period between Weaning off citalopram and starting Mirtazapine, so I’m willing to stick it out at least 2-3 months with the hope that it will calm down."

Thing is I started to feel good on citalopram very quickly so I’m a bit dishearten that a few weeks on Mirtazapine and I don’t feel any better, my relationships are suffering because of my anger and irritation but I can’t help it, I feel awful after every outburst but I’m trying to hold out till I see a difference, how long would you recommend I stick it out for? It’s been 3 weeks since I started but I was gonna try sticking it out for at least 2-3 months before I go back to my docs."

Don’t forget he’s been identified as a potential new male Force use hero, who could potentially carry the franchise forward in the future, so obviously he’s gonna want the support of his fellow snarky fanboys, hence why he’s been so vocal lately, so obvious."

This is abuse, they’re holding you hostage  your 19 now you have no obligation to stay with them. 

Unless you want to get any higher authorities involved, although I’m not sure who that would be as your over 18 now, the only solution I can see to your situation is to literally get a job, as scary as it may seem, it’s your only chance to interact in the real world, socialise and make friends, and make some money so you can save for college without having to rely on your control freak parents to pay for it.  

Being brought up the way you have,  I’m positive this will be a very scary thing got you to do, so I would also go and see your doctor,  to refer you for some therapy to help you mentally prepare for taking back control of your life.  I promise you you won’t die in a few days if you went off to live on your own, the world is scary, but not as scary as your parents made you think, there are a lot of people and organisations out there that will only be too willing to help you get on your own two feet.

You needed to vent and you chose to do that to an adult father figure who will be totally unbiased to the whole situation and keep your business private at the same time...nothing wrong with that, you did the right thing talking to someone about it, because it’s not good to hold things like that in. 

I really wouldn’t worry about seeing him again, he’s not stupid he’s an adult and probably already knows you’ll be feeling a little awkward, and if he’s the awesome guy you’ve described him as, then he’ll probably do his best to be totally normal with you when he die see you, still if I fell like I still need to say something to him then take him aside and just say “ I’m sorry I fell apart like that the other day, I really didn’t know I needed to let all those things out  so much, until I started talking” I’m positive he’ll tell u to stop being silly and that he’ll always be there for you moving g forward."
