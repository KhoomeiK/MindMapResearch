Its a small place where i live, everyone has a connection to everyone. 
I have lived here all my life (in my 20s too) and I hate every second. When I was younger there are so many public moments that wouldn't have happened without my bpd. Public drunk/sober meltdowns, rumours I was too socially anxious to set straight, relationships I've previously fucked up and the way I used to be, there is no escaping. 

I remember being 15 at a house party, drunk asf and my rapist had turned up outside once and then came back and not one of my friends had told me until I'd walked outside and saw him. Everyone watched,whispered and laughed while I screamed, I cried, got on my knees and screamed about all he'd done to me. The police turned up and then left (I have no fucking clue either, we were not the age to legally drink) so that was that, eventually people left and I was still not sober (I had substance abuse issues, still do), and I ended up getting into a fight with two of the girls there who were helping clean up, one beat my ass and I was pulled away from the other. Incidents like this fucking hurt to think about, I get you and I wish I had someway to help you with that though, I am just as bad."
BPD,fb5ltmz,t3_ebeg79,1576529994.0,"I relate, i havent seen my fp in months because they want me to hang out with their friends and I'd honestly rather them hang out without me, it's not that I dislike them, I just hate being the third wheel of the group because people tend to like others more than me.

I'm trying to get rid of the attachment I have to them as I feel I've messed everything up by being unintentionally (and in a few cases intentionally) removed from the group and when I am involved in anything they're doing, I tend to get jealous so easily. I just don't want to be that person who only wants my fp all to myself. So yeah, now all I do is work and sleep and ive never felt so suicidal lmao"
BPD,fap7vuf,t3_eac1nd,1576282111.0,"Hi, a sort of similar thing happened to me but on the other side of the coin. Though, I wasn't someone to throw things at him not hurt him at all. 

From my experience, it's hard to accept love/help. I was someone quite like that, couldn't ever accept. It wasn't you, so please never think that. 

As for the moving on so quick, for me, I felt like my partner could leave me at any time (as a lot of people with bpd feel with relationships that mean a lot to them. Anyway, i could already feel the break up coming. I was distraught when I could literally feel him drifting away, he was my FP and I couldn't imagine being without him (the sense of safety and the closest you can be with someone). 

I remember seeing my now ex after a few months and he was genuinely trying to be nice but I felt so betrayed (as Id held him too high) that I was just so cold with him.
 
So yeah, I think it's the feeling of betrayal so being cold is the easiest and least painful and less embarrassing way to respond. And moving on is possibly a way to feel something after feeling so numb from being left by a person (even though it was what was best for either one of you) but I think maybe just filling a gap ? 

I don't want to demonize, and I'm only speaking from experience, emotions get deep and sometimes you get to numb to feel anything when your fp is not in your life any longer. So sometime people accept other love when they might not even want it but because it's there.

I'm sorry you went through all of that and I hope you're both doing better!"
BPD,fao9rk3,t1_fane06f,1576259997.0,"YES!!! And the fact that the client voted boris because he seems to have a ""better personality""... like nothing else, no research put into that decision... and as for my colleague, she's only happy because she has money behind her, has a house and car shop that is worth quite a bit. She just doesn't want pay tax or anything at that.. I also had clients telling me that Jeremy Corbyn is a communist.. I had to hold my tongue, because if I didn't  I wouldve asked them to tell me the definition of communism because corbyn sure ain't advocating for that.

There are similar symptoms in bipolar and bpd, so it is quite easy for the doctor to wrongly misdiagnose. It's frustrating but hang in there and maybe try to hold yourself back if you feel you're being horrible/unfair..

It just began with being excluded in games they were already playing, and then shortly after being included in pass the parcel. I thought this was weird because no one played that anymore. It kept landing on me, at the last wrap, i unwravelled to find 'the ugly duckling' book as they proceeded to giggle.
Then wasnt allowed any snacks one of the girls mother had left us, and when I asked why, a girl proceeded to throw popcorn next to me on the floor and say 'have that if you're that hungry'. Was made to sleep on the floor with nothing but my bag and coat because there ""wasn't enough space in the bed for me"" in the middle of the night all i could hear was whispering, not long after my head was being jumped on as was the rest of my body. I cried all night and stayed awake in fear they would do something else. I beat myself up thinking ""why don't they like me? What is wrong with me"" I've never told my parents but I'm sure I've overshared to strangers. So yeah, the day it triggered or then again, maybe it's the day I died inside."
