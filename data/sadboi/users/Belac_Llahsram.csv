philosophy,fqnglgw,t1_fqm7fpw,1589494480.0,We tell ourselves that because we do understand those things. Birds fly due to a set of evolutionary conditions that favored flying. Etc.
philosophy,fqngd4t,t1_fqlt5ty,1589494361.0,"Agreed, purpose itself an entirely subjective aspect of things that only exists due to conciousness itself. Saying the universe and life is purposeless is only really possible by assuming a universal or unconcious frame of reference. However this is pointless due to the fact that to these things the human concept of purpose does not exist, nor do any concepts. 

Purpose literally defined is ""the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists"". Which applies to anything that we understand. For example planets exist because mass accumulates into spheres when not interacted with by any other forces. That is the reason."
