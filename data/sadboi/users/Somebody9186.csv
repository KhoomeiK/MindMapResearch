Also, sometimes I am sure that even animals are better than we are. Especially when you see how oblivious some people go through their day and completely ignoring what they did wrong."

How great would it be if you could just erase your existence and be finally at ease without harming yourself. I can’t even think about the future not even a day or two, because I can’t imagine myself live any longer in this world. There is nothing I still enjoy to do and I can’t sleep most of the time because I can’t stand the thought that then the next day would begin. The only thing I can do is live day after day but even that is hard. I sometimes don’t know whats wrong with me."
