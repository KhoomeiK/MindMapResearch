bipolar,fq8bkvs,t3_ghc7ll,1589162509.0,"Yup this happened to me. I ended up not sleeping for 4 days. When I thought it was all over, I wake up a day after a crazy night and found out I almost put myself in a mental hospital, with no recall of what happened. The Crisis number that I called, called me back to check on me, and they told me everything."
