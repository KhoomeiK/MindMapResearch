Don’t beat yourself up over the amount of times you have been admitted, it’s hard to manage sometimes. Just take each day as they come and don’t be afraid to reach out for help. 
Also celebrate those small accomplishments. For example, when I haven’t had an episode in a while I’ll congratulate myself (buy myself something small or just spend the day relaxing) or if I haven’t missed a dosage of my meds. Make sure to celebrate the small things."

I know lots of girls that love waxing down there but for me it was just too much and I don’t find two-three weeks with no hair worth the pain. The only way to tell if you will be able to handle it is to try it yourself. 
With laser it feels more like a rubber band being slapped against your skin. If it really hurts and you can’t tolerate it, they can turn the laser down a little. Also it’s down in like 5 minutes.
But I have gotten my nipples pierced and that didn’t hurt at all, so I don’t necessarily have a low pain tolerance."

A good trick for making a girl cum is the fingers your using to finger her curve them upward and use your thumb to rub her clit (make sure your thumb is wet though). Before all that make sure your doing other things to turn her on, ask her what she likes 
For me is bondage and dominance that turns me on"
