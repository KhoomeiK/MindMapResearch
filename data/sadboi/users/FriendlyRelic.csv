I know there’s a bit of a thing in the BP community about self diagnosis. That’s not what this is about.

My parents had a really difficult time dealing with the fact that their child was mentally ill. I was able to get therapy after my GCP prescribed me with anti-depressants, brought my parents to an appointment (with the therapists ok), and let him talk to them and explain everything.

It’s getting out of bed, starting a new day, and accepting that I’m going to have to deal with all these thoughts today (guilt from missing work or class, ghosting friends, etc... So if I stayed in bed I could avoid all of that.

It’s actually a pretty common thing. I deal with it by breaking down getting out of bed into steps 1: sit up in bed. Not so bad. 2: Covers off (only rough when it’s cold). 3: Feet on the floor. 4: Turn on the lights, 5: standup.

I know it sounds ridiculous, but it gives something easy and achievable to focus on. Usually once I’m out of bed shower, clothes and meds come a lot easier.

depression,fpd5e4u,t3_gcnpaj,1588520193.0,"Hey, I’ve been there. Coming from a 28 year old, a few thoughts that were able to pierce through the lies depression tells you (at least for me):

1. Early to mid twenties are still when you’re figuring out yourself. Cut yourself some slack. It’s really common to feel lost and just floating. I definitely felt that way too.

2. There’s two thoughts on college degrees. The big misconception is that you have to get a degree in something you really enjoy. That’s kinda BS IMO. I think long term, a job that lets you do what you want to do outside of work is pretty reasonable. Living for your job is a pretty old way of thinking, and I think it’s wrong.

3. You’re running your own race. Other people are different. They might look like have their shit together, but it doesn’t mean they’re stronger or you’re broken. Comparing yourself to them only gives more fuel for depression.

Idk if you’re in a position to start going back into therapy, but my therapist has helped me make some strategies to deal with a lot of the negative things depression makes you believe.

The worst thing about depression is your enemy is your brain. It gaslights you, makes you see only negative qualities, and does it’s best to stop you from treating it.

I’m really sorry you’re going through it. It sucks. A lot.

Fuck Depression."
depression,fpd3kwo,t1_fpch5gg,1588519108.0,"I’m not trying to invalidate you here (if you have bipolar disorder you have it lol), but most episodes usually last a lot longer than 1-4 hours. When you get in a spot where you have access to medication you should also get checked for borderline personality disorder. It’s similar to BP except mood changes come from emotions as opposed to just, well, happening. There’s a type of rapid-cycling BP but it’s not very common, and even then episode last days, not hours.

It’s really important to get the right diagnosis. While it’s totally worth it, the antipsychotics you take for BP can be way harder on your body, and therapy strats will be different for either.

In my case, when I was trying to figure out what was going on, we started with ADHD/ADD comorbid with Depression (which can be misdiagnosed as BPD as well). After having a manic episode triggered by Adderall, we fell to Bipolar II."

Depression does this nasty thing of tricking you into believing that seeing the world in gray is normal. You forget what feeling good... feels like.

My grandmother is Bipolar and I had no idea until I was trying to get a diagnosis and asked around my family for any mental health issues.

Benzo’s are a big deal. They can really help but they can also really ruin lives. It’s important to remember that."
BipolarReddit,fhq0m14,t1_fhp5eun,1581797677.0,"100% you’re correct. My script for Klonopin is exactly 14, and it only gets renewed every 2 or 3 months. I agree that daily Benzodiazepines are where you have a high risk of addiction (and the trouble that comes with a ton of Benzodiazepines). Except for extraordinary circumstances, I don’t think anyone should be popping Benzodiazepines daily or twice daily. It’s the doctors and patients responsibility to check that that doesn’t start happening."
BipolarReddit,fhoy2x0,t1_fhow3jq,1581777522.0,"Hold up, let’s pump the brakes for a few seconds. I don’t have a problem with what you’re saying about Bieber, Doctor shopping, etc... but Benzo’s are fantastic treatment to divert a panic attack. Klonopin is fairly non-euphoric, and if your prescriber trusts you enough it’s 100% ok to have a prescription. I really only have experience with klonopin, so that’s where I’m coming from.

Taking Benzodiazepines to “numb the pain” is exactly what they’re designed to do. They slow everything down. When I’m hypomanic, I have a ton of nervous and anxious energy. It feels like I’m buzzing underneath my skin, and it’s incredibly uncomfortable. On a bad day my pdoc and I would much rather have me take a Klonopin and stay relatively functional then be racked with panic attacks or get smashed.

It’s not like we haven’t tried other drugs as well. Most anything else has given me Akathisia, which is absolutely terrible. We’ve come to the conclusion that lamictal, beta-blockers and Wellbutrin are used for day to day issues, and if it’s a really terrible day then klonopin can be pulled out.

So yeah, most Benzo’s have a really high potential to be abused, but saying “nobody needs to be on Benzodiazepines” is flatly incorrect. If you treat them like a controlled substances, take steps to prevent abuse of them, and choose a Benzo with a lower chance of abuse they can really help increase the quality of life for some people."

There are also a lot of non benzos that work really well. The only reason I got prescribed Klonopin was that my P-doc trusts me a ton and she's been my doctor forever.  


Talk to your P-doc for help there.  


Mid panic attack, do your best to focus on something physical. Either your legs touching the group, or maybe squeezing your hand. The goal here is not to end the panic attack, it's just to get out of your head. I usually do the leg thing.

I was having a really hard time, and ended up being gone for a week. Like totally offline, everything. I had just got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and I was slowly self destructing. When I finally came back(after a week), everyone had switched to a different discord chat, leaving me and two other people behind.

Apparently, two sets of couples had broken up, causing a schism. And it was decided that I did not belong in the group of friends that I had actually met in real life (by someone I hadn’t met in real life). Groupthink took over and I kinda became a pariah. So I had just been diagnosed bipolar, was already having a hard time, and practically my whole support group ghosted me. It sent me on a pretty big downward spiral I’m still coming back from.

Tremors with Lamictal is pretty rare, especially because it sounds like it’s the only thing you’re taking.

Depending on what type of lamictal you’re taking, 25 mg isn’t really a therapeutic dose as well. So yeah, it may be lamictal but you might want to switch pdocs because yours doesn’t sound as familiar with bipolar disorder, and you want to get some other things checked out as well in case it isn’t the lamictal.

Alternatives to lamictal are a family of drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which in my experience had way worse side effects, and lithium."

She’s in college now. She may just be a freshman or sophomore but it’s at this time where people actually grow up. Take her out for a coffee or a nice meal. Apologize first and foremost, then explain where you were coming from and why you overreacted so much. Then try to reach an agreement. Something like “hey you can have girls over, it’s ok!

My Dad’s best friend from his childhood committed suicide and he took it so hard. It was a very long time ago and he still gets teary eyed talking about it.

My mom had breast cancer, just like her mom. My grandmother died from it young. My mom caught it very early but it’s likely going to come back.

My other grandmother has dementia combined with another mental illness (which she passed onto me). That’s another nail in the coffin.

My grandfather has a rare autoimmune disorder where his immune system attacks the nerve sheathings in his leg. His memory is failing and he keeps forgetting to take his meds. Another nail.

If I committed suicide it would destroy everybody. I doubt my dad could take it. And I know my mom would find some way to blame herself. My brother wouldn’t say anything, but he’d think about it all the time, no doubt. My sister is also pretty depressed so it would be hard on her.
