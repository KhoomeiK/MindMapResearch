AskVet,fqsq1eq,t3_gko6vw,1589614857.0,"We use ProDen PlaqueOff and it’s seriously the best. 

My husband and I adopted a farm dog who had only lived outside, never had a teeth cleaning, and had been neglected causing her teeth to be in worse shape than they already would’ve been, and the plaque was able to be wiped off with a tissue! Her teeth are so much whiter now; they were basically brown when we brought her home.

It’s a type of seaweed that causes the plaque to fall off of their teeth. Our vet recommended it for us, so as far as I can say, it’s totally safe. We use it for all three of our cats and four dogs and the bottle has lasted us almost a year.

Edit: I forgot to say, you just sprinkle it on their food once a day. It gives you a chart on the bottle that tells you how much to give them per pound of weight. :)"

I tried to make it with just an associate’s degree, and while it’s helped some, most of the jobs that I’ve been offered have been pretty unbearable by my standards (plus they didn’t offer health insurance). I had thought about going back to school for teaching, but after subbing, it is not a path for me. I enjoy my free time. 

I’m going back for psychology this fall. Just a couple years and I’ll have my bachelor’s degree, and although a BS in psych doesn’t get me a ton of money, it gets me a better job while I’m getting my master’s degree. Maybe that’s something that you would like as well? It’s a career that helps people plus puts food on the table. You can also choose your own hours as a therapist depending on who you work for.

I’m still going into my office for now because there are only about eight people per floor at the moment, but I am immunocompromised and I have asthma, so I may end up just taking the layoff to keep from getting sick. My mom suggested that my husband and I both get jobs at Walmart and not self quarantine if I get laid off. 

She makes $64 an hour, is essential staff so they won’t close down, but won’t offer any help. She just doesn’t care if I get sick. At all. She would rather I do the “respectable” thing and pull myself up from the bootstraps like her lord and savior president Trump wants for all of us. I even brought up that we don’t have enough ventilators, and they’re implementing that people with higher survival rates be given hospital care first, which puts me at a severe disadvantage. I’m young but I also have health problems. 

Well it turns out, this should’ve been talked about instead of Trump’s impeachment. Because now it’s political. My health, my life, my ability to survive. It’s all political. That’s what I’m worth. She doesn’t care that I or anyone else could be in immediate danger. I just can’t do this any more.

Both options kind of suck, tbh. Layoff = no money but going into work = more exposure. I’m just looking for opinions because I’m really not sure what to do. I have asthma and so I’m at a slightly higher risk, but I’m also 24 and pretty healthy, if that helps any.

Started off as an annoying dry cough, then progressed until I was almost vomiting from coughing so hard, low grade fever, shortness of breath, body aches and stiffness, tightness of the chest and throat. I thought it was the flu but tested negative for it. Had it for *weeks* until it finally went away. I would stand in the shower with Vix liquid in the basin just hoping it would clear up my airway. 

Constantly put vapo-rub all over my nose and chest to see if maybe that would help me breathe and get that horrible cough to subside. Nope. Nothing helped and I never coughed anything up which made me so mad because it felt like there was stuff weighing down my lungs.

My Dr. put me on antibiotics just in case, but I’m not sure if it helped or not. I remember going into the urgent care and the Dr. told me that roughly 60% of patients he’d been seeing the past few weeks had the exact same symptoms I did. At the time I thought “must be some hell of a virus going around” because it seemed like everyone was getting it. My mom eventually got it and ended up with pneumonia.

I totally get the frustration though. I’m not sure what my husband is because he also doesn’t like to label himself.

Unfortunately though, as humans, it’s our responsibility to use our better judgment when it comes to our pets suffering. I hope you can carry this with you lighter and lighter until one day it’s not so heavy on your shoulders any more."
cats,fjoypo7,t1_fjoyjvx,1583537709.0,"I always thought she’d make it to around there. I’m honestly not sure what happened, she seemed so healthy. We all made the joke that Angel would outlive us all because she was so healthy. But I guess I was just time for her little body to wear out."
cats,fjok6bu,t3_fej18a,1583529393.0,"I just wanted to share some stories with you guys. Some memories that I’ve accumulated through almost twenty years with her.

When I was around seven or eight, we thought I had sleep apnea. I would wake up in the middle of the night and not be able to breathe at all and then just immediately drift back to sleep. This went on for months until one night I woke up and noticed my nose was itchy this time. When I tried to scratch it, I felt purring on my face. She’d been sleeping on my face for *months* and I just thought I wasn’t breathing.

About two years ago, she walked over a lit candle and she literally caught on fire. She had no idea that her tail was on fire, and she was super pissed off when I held her down and beat her tail until the fire was out.

She loved music. Loved it. Opera was her favorite. She’s actually the reason I became a singer, because when I would sing when I was little, she would purr and meow and roll around all over the place. She did this up until the day she died. Any time she was sick, or sad, or nervous, I would sing to her or my husband would play his guitar for her. Any time we moved or just relocated her bed and litter box, I would play classical music for her to fall asleep to.

My God, was she always into everything. All the time. She would beg for food, even if we both knew her picky little ass didn’t want it. She would try to scoop it out of my hand and get me to drop it. She was always walking all over my nightstand, trying to open doors, trying to flush the toilet for some reason, walking behind my tv and laying on my tv box. She was one of those cats who would look at you, then look at your glass of water, and just knock it over because she could. 

She never really played. Just acted like she wanted to and then bit the crap out of you for being stupid enough to try it.

Angel saved my life on multiple occasions, and I may not be here today if not for her. She used to wake me up at night when my blood sugar got low. If I didn’t wake up from it, she would kneed on me and meow at me until I woke up to check my blood sugar and got a snack. She was always watching out for me.

The only time she would play is if you gave her an olive. I have no clue what it was about them, but she went nuts over a regular old green olive. She would bat them around and play with them like it was catnip. 

She would scream if she wanted attention. It would start off like a normal meow, and just slowly escalate to her yawling and screaming. This was normally anywhere from midnight to around four in the morning. She hated being away from me, even if she had a kitty friend to cuddle with, and was with me every second of the day that I was at home. She thrived off of attention.

Angel was seriously so grumpy. All the time. That was just her general state of being. That’s probably why we got along so well.

She had the fastest paws in the Midwest. That cat would beat the living crap out of whoever was in her way or bothering her. If another pet approached her and she wasn’t in the mood, they were getting their heads bopped.

All she ever wanted from me was love and attention. She was part of the family. She was my best friend, my baby, and the absolute light of my life. I would’ve taken years off of my own life to give to her, and I know she would’ve done anything for me. Even though she peed on anything that was left in the floor, I know it was just because she wanted me to know that we belonged with each other. She was a truly amazing cat."

I really wish I hadn’t now. But by the time it really started picking up I was already in too deep and felt like I needed closure with the show. I had to be sure everyone did time for it and had to watch them be put away."

I think Elizabeth Moss is gorgeous. She’s seriously one of my favorite actresses and one of the prettiest and most unique looking people I’ve ever seen. But you don’t resemble her at all.

However, maybe your absolute inability to take a compliment and obvious need to criticize is why you aren’t widely accepted at any of your recent places of work? Just a thought."

Cringetopia,fjf1iso,t3_fcu4kb,1583282311.0,"I once knew a couple like this in high school. The girl was goth through and through, and that’s all well and good, but she also spoke with a British accent and claimed it was a brain disorder (even though she would slip up and speak normally now and again). They would do weird shit like this in the halls, vampire teeth and all.

She and the guy, who called himself “Frost”, broke up like a month later. I felt bad for the dude so I would talk to him on occasion in one of our classes. He started calling me “Kitty” as a nickname for some reason even though my name is nothing like Kitty at all, made me read his horrible story he wrote in which his fake British ex was the big bad, and then told me he had a half Japanese half brother named Jake who was a year younger than us. 

I guess he didn’t think it through that we were juniors because the next year he claimed that Jake died in a car accident and wouldn’t be coming to school with us because he had tragically been impaled during a head-on collision.

I still to this day get secondhand embarrassment for Frost and all of his oddities when I remember it."
aww,fj9b8j0,t1_fj8ss92,1583140342.0,Yes! My cat was just doing this earlier! He would reach for my hand if I pulled it away and then wrap his paws around it and cuddle his head into my wrist. I love my Hector cat.
findapath,fj9b1wx,t3_fc5meo,1583140087.0,"I feel like a lot of us are in the same boat. I also have ADD and dyslexia/dyscalculia, so school has always been really hard for me. It took me five years just to get my associate’s degree. I’m currently looking for office positions so that I can have insurance and then I’m planning on attending some courses for phlebotomy this fall semester. Maybe it’s not glamorous, and it’s not everyone’s cup of tea for sure, but it’s something that I think I can be good at that will most likely have the benefits that I’m looking for. A lucrative career doesn’t have to be one that you planned out. You know what I went to school for? Music. Sometimes our first choice isn’t the one that ends up being right for us. I think that’s okay and normal. Maybe criminal justice isn’t for you, and maybe that’s just fine. You could end up being the best restaurant owner, lab assistant, or dental hygienist and you’d have never known had your first set of plans worked out."

SelfAwarewolves,fj39uud,t1_fj2qxef,1582974783.0,"It can be dangerous to the public for diabetics not to have their medical necessities, though. Driving with high or low blood sugars is like driving drunk, and most people can’t just stay home from work because their blood sugar is high, especially if they already can’t afford their insulin. It can also cause seizures and general impairment/lack of judgment. I guess it would need to be more consistently dangerous though? Honestly, if I have to commit crimes to get my insulin, I will. I shouldn’t have to die just because I’m not enough of a threat to society to survive."
Rabbits,fiyvbmm,t1_fiyuooe,1582847776.0,"My husband and I bunny proofed about how we had ferret proofed in the past, but it seems like every time I go in there, I find something that could be problematic. It’s usually something like a piece of tape hanging off of a box that I know he shouldn’t eat, or small areas he could sequester himself in that I didn’t think about until now, little things that probably aren’t a big deal but make me feel like the room isn’t ready yet. I feel like if I keep knit picking he’ll just never be out, though. But I had a ferret who ended up with a bowel obstruction a few years ago and it just really freaks me out that it could end up being my fault he gets hurt. I was a dumb college kid when I had my ferrets, so I’ve learned a lot since then; but man, I just want him to be safe."
Rabbits,fiyu9ne,t1_fiysyrs,1582847090.0,"He’s in a 4x4, but it’s really only supposed to be for adjusting to being here, and then his litter box and hide are in it. He has a whole bedroom that’s just his, but we’re really wanting him to have free roam of the house in general. He’s just so little that it really freaked me out having him free roaming while I’m distracted. I’ve had adult bunnies, but he’s the first I’ve ever gotten as a baby, so I’m not used to such tininess! You’re probably right though, I’m sure he was upset that he had to go back in there instead of all the new space he has to explore. He has some toys, but I probably need to just ease him into free roam (more for myself than him) and not worry about putting him back up all together."
