I actually had a lot of the same problems your son is having. I was struggling with friends for a while after I kicked out of school. My therapist recommended finding a group of people interested in stuff he is interested in, there are plenty if websites where you can browse through groups that have actual meetups. Obviously this was before the Corona but after things have calmed down I assume those site will be active again."

depression,fcfs9ya,t3_eh41bc,1577633289.0,"I'm not going to say the situation is the same but I felt the same way you do. I ended up cutting ties with all my friends after I got kicked out of school. It was a combination of being depressed, ashamed and really I projected the thought that they were better than me and they wouldnt want to waste their time. After about a year one of them reached out and along with someone else we all hung out. After I basically went no contact again for another year. I got so lonely and I was going to try and make new friends but then I got randomly added to a group chat with almost all of my old friends in it. One of them had asked why I wasnt in the chat already. Out of shock I made some stupid joke and basically everyone made a big deal about me rejoining and basically invited me to hang out once every week. I work on the day they usually meet up and they moved it to a day I was free without me even asking. It's been about 6 months since I've been added back and it's really amazing to have my friends back. I would die for these guys and they would do the same for me. I realized with the help of some therapy that I was pushing people away because I felt like shit and projecting my feelings. Like I said at the beginning our situations might not be the same but I would say consider that because you are depressed you might have a warped view. Regardless I hope things get better for you!"
depression,fblqrf4,t3_edpkii,1576967864.0,"Yes when I was first experiencing depression I was literally mad at everything and everyone for the smallest little thing. Part of it might of been teen angst but depression definitely made it worse. I will say that it can pass like it did for me, my depression changed and had new forms. Please take care of yourself and try and talk to someone ."

I didnt graduate I'm still taking classes part time but I got kicked out cause I let depression and suicidal thoughts go unchecked assuming I could force my way through. Turns out that isn't how that works. I always have to come up with some lie about why I didnt make it and then i have to remember who knows and who doesn't, aside from the fact that its embarrassing it's just annoying at this point. Maybe I'm being too sensitive idk"
AskReddit,f452e2v,t3_djabmx,1571364383.0,"I deal with depression and anxiety and I also have an addictive personality. I also have problems with instant gratification versus long term that I am working on. The first time I got buzzed, not even drunk, i felt invincible like nothing could ever hurt me and all my problems went away. I woke up the next morning and came to the realization i can't trust myself. I am in too bad of a place to even try that again. If I ever learn some real self control maybe I'll give it a shot but until then it's a no."
depression,f30ttml,t3_dezigp,1570562303.0,Holy shit yes! I spent most of my teenage years angry at fucking everyone. When my mom would ask me to do something like wash the dishes I would be annoyed and slowly move to anger. I started to fight with her and my younger brother a lot. I was a shy kid too and then all the sudden i was outspoken and angry. I wouldnt ever admit to being wrong when I was mad either. I'm pretty sure people wrote it off as my rebellious phase but I found out later I was depressed and anxious and I was really angry at myself and just wanted to pin my misery on others. I hope that you know you aren't alone. I would suggest talking to someone if you can. I hope things get better for you.
relationship_advice,f26dzg8,t3_dc4x8f,1570005194.0, I'm 23 and pretty much in the same boat. I was dealing with some mental health stuff and pushed people away. I just barely reconnected with my friends and I dont know how to go about women at all. Not really helpful I know but I wanted you to know you aren't alone and in my opinion it's not that weird anymore. Best of luck.
AskReddit,f1uzzh5,t3_dap9i1,1569765540.0,"That I was suicidal for like 8 years, I never attempted but I sure was close to it. Contemplated failing out of high school so I would get the courage to do it. They know I was depressed but only because I was kicked out of college. They think it happened there, I've been depressed since I was 10. I would like to say my parents are very supportive but they kinda annoyed me off of antidepressants by constantly asking me when the therapist said I could get off them because they were bad for me. They dont really get it even though they try. I also am the kind of person that I would rather suffer in silence than burden people with my problems. Decided it wouldnt do any one any good if they knew I wanted to kill myself, I'm doing better now anyway."

depression,f0yxagr,t3_d78p2v,1569080976.0,"I've been struggle with depression for years and you've said exactly how it feels. I'm doing better now but I still look back and think of the 4 month period where I didnt go to class, I didnt talk to anyone and I would just sit in my room watching anything to get my mind occupied. It was a miserable existence and I remember thinking at the time when life came to get me I would kill myself. Now I look back, I'm still kicking and doing better but I have a nostalgia for that time. I miss it. It's hard to talk to people about how I could possible miss a time where i was isolated, not taking care of myself and suicidal. Your post really says what I was thinking while also hitting about being stuck but at the same time the relief that  living like that brings. Anyway I hope that things get better for you, and I hope that knowing you aren't alone helps even a little."
relationship_advice,ezszflx,t3_d25oe8,1568116395.0,"I'm a guy with depression and anxiety and to me it sounds like your anxiety is getting the better of you. I wouldnt say it's normal to think these thoughts especially since it's going so well, it seems to me your anxiety is making up worries and you become afraid of losing your boyfriend. Anxiety is basically you always thinking something bad is going to happen like losing your boyfriend because you dont show him ""maximum affection""/ smothering him with affection. I think what you have to do is take a step back and talk to him about it. Ask him if he feels smothered or if he feels like he isn't getting enough affection and when he gives you an answer trust in that answer and just make it clear that you want communication so that it stays that way. If you both are comfortable in talking about things than there is no reason for him not to tell you when something changes meaning you can continue the way things are. On the another note I would talk to someone about your anxiety/depression maybe a professional or even someone you trust, I wont speak for you but I have never effectively handled it on my own. I hope everything goes well for you!"
AskReddit,eyypn1c,t3_czhasg,1567597926.0,"Basically family no matter how much I would think that they were better off without me I couldn't imagine hurting them more than I have. I kinda decided if I was gonna be miserable I would at least fake it for those around me as not to bring them down. When I can't handle it I disappear for like 2 months claiming to be ""busy"" until I get it under control again. It isn't the best but its fucking something."

AskReddit,es5wj9o,t3_c5zjhc,1561631914.0,Constant over thinking to the point of inaction. It leads to me not enjoying most things and makes me very awkward to be around because I think about how I should act or what someone means. I'm often just quietly sitting there lost in thought. It actually made my depression and anxiety so bad I was suicidal for like 3 years. Learning to deal with it but it never really just stops.

mentalhealth,eopra38,t3_bsr2vk,1558773202.0,I went through this myself. Ive been depressed for around 10 years now and I was suicidal for about 7 I've been on an upward trend recently so I hope I can help. I would teary eyed as well and what I will say is that the only way I was able to cry was when I made myself. I would wait till I was feeling particularly  low and watch like an hour of sad videos and I would think about all these bad things and I finally cried. I agree that it's kinda a numbness and I think you body does it to protect you for example I didn't cry at my grandpa's funeral but like 3 months later a TV show made me cry. I am not a professional but I think you experience a hardship and then you go into shock and you get numb until you process your feelings. Again I can only talk from my experience but I hope that this helps and I wish you the best.
DBZDokkanBattle,eopo6ch,t3_bso091,1558770427.0,Lol this but replace broly with the go bros. I got broly in 4 multis but the go bros I fucking lost count how many it was. really hurt my wallet especially buying stones at full price. Funny enough I finally got them like the day before broly came out.
