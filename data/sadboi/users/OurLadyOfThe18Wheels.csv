Nobody has a problem with you because you don't have problems with anyone. You're a simple person with a simple life, but that doesn't mean everyone can walk in whenever they want. You're very selective with who gets to know the real you and keep a small circle of people who you know will ride for you until the end. All in all, you're a good person.

I'll take it."
