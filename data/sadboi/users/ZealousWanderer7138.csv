depression,eyjn5rr,t1_eyjmu23,1567123034.0,Yeah I'm going to try to go to a different one. I hope they will actually be able to help me
depression,eyjmhlp,t3_cx82fo,1567122567.0,"Yes, mine says she can't help me if there isn't anything I want to talk about. She always asks me to say three good things and three bad things that have happened since the last visit, but I struggle with that. It's not that bad things are happening to make me feel this way, I can't help it. Now I have anxiety about going because I'm afraid she'll fire me if I can't think of anything to talk about."
depression,eyjlrr7,t3_cwzyvh,1567122084.0,I feel the exact same. That's the only time I have peace. The only good part of my day is when I can feel myself drifting off and my worries melting away. That's the only reason I'm able to get out of bed in the morning.
