AskReddit,fpwum9k,t3_gfsi0q,1588970267.0,"Back in the 80s mom would leave my sister and I in the book section of Woolco, Kmart, Walmart, whatever, while she shopped. Qe loved books and would sit and read. I was pretty smart for an 8 year old. A man came near us and had one of those shopping baskets over his arm. He motioned for me to look inside basket and he had porn magazines opened to certain pages. I took my sister and moved to next aisle. Then he followed us. So I left to find mom. I never said a word til in my 30s when i remembered. She was of course really upset I didnt tell and I'm not sure why I didnt. I think I was more scared of the commotion I knew it would've caused than of the man."

AskReddit,fft9fqx,t3_ev0jdd,1580213296.0,"Growing up my house was the chill spot. We had a rec room down stairs. All my friends came over all the time. I had the idea to put 2 large white pieces of bristal board up on the wall and we could all sign it, draw on it, whatever (this is in the 90s before computers and phones everywhere). I had a friend who was really artistic and drew everyone according to their nic names and personalities. Caricatures of us all as teens. Because it had weed and drinking references my mother found it and threw it out!! Worse yet, that artistic friend committed suicide in our early 20s. When I think of this my entire body cringes and it hurts really bad. I'd give anything to have him and those drawings back.
