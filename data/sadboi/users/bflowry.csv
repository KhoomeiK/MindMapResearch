fuckeatingdisorders,f4rjxrt,t3_dlghd8,1571768465.0,"Reiterating all of the comments by other posters. I couldn’t have said any of it better myself.

Body comments are extremely triggering; it’s often a lose-lose situation. If someone says I look “good,” my mind spins, trying to put a definition to “good.” If someone says I look thin, my mind spins just as fast, again focusing solely on semantics (which will never be good enough to match what the eating disorder wants to hear/feel).

It would be extremely helpful if body comments, in general, weren’t so commonly exchanged in every day interactions. Unfortunately, it’s unavoidable. What we can do for ourselves is strengthen the voice of our true selves by working to actively rewire those outdated, negative neural pathways with new thoughts/beliefs. The work is hard, but trusting that the effort and time are worth it. You aren’t alone. 💛"

This makes a lot of sense—that Scorpios value the emotional undercurrents (passion, intimacy, love) that sex evokes, rather than the simple act itself.

When I share my Sun sign, I feel the need to state that I’m not “overly sexual” like most view Scorpios as being. This clears that up, without having to subscribe to that superficial label any longer. Us Scorpios are not just sexual."

fuckeatingdisorders,f3o1sck,t3_dheszu,1571006266.0,"Oftentimes, when “allowing” unrestricted/normal eating following restrictive eating habits, it’s reactive eating you’re experiencing—NOT bingeing. 

Think of if this way: if you haven’t allowed yourself to eat X (insert any food item previously restricted/banned) in X amount of time, it’s only natural that the physiological response is that which resembles extreme hunger, for fear that X will be restricted again.

The body is a very smart machine. Biological drives are innate, and there for good reason. With an eating disorder, our hunger cues are thrown out of whack, so it will take time for them to balance. Part of that balance is riding the wave of extreme hunger and reactive eating."

That’s the perspective we’re seeing from when we look into the mirror—and it’s the eating disorder’s tricks, taunts, and maliciousness that’s keep us in a death-grip (literally), distorting our perception.

Having an eating disorder makes it incredibly difficult to be “happy” with our body (read: difficult, but not impossible). When we separate and differentiate exterior values (physical appearance) versus internal values (character, personality, quirks), it’s easier to pursue what lights our souls up (what makes us happy) in a more authentic, wholehearted way.

As for worrying about what you’re eating—the ED will always, always find something wrong with food. Whether it’s the quantity, quality, method of consumption, etc. “Good enough” is not in ED’s vocabulary.

The cravings you’re experiencing are likely a result of cumulative restriction that your body has undergone. After not having “permission” to have cravings and eat “scary foods,” once we finally give permission, it makes sense to want ALL of it. Because our bodies are so terrified of not being able to have XYZ again. This is called “reactive eating,” and it’s a direct result of restriction and compensation for eating.

Your body is trying to heal, and that takes an immense amount of calories and rest. You’re doing the right thing by honoring your cravings and speaking your truth."

As hard as it is to live with constant anxiety, it must also be difficult to not know how to help alleviate the anxiety of a loved one/someone you care for.

*""Your eyes are broken.""*

This was a phrase that my mother used to say to me throughout my recovery (which included my relapses, as well). With an internal mental dialogue of ""I need to lose more weight,"" ""I don't like the way I look,"" it's hard for one's perception to counteract those judgments (for example: If you feel that you don't like the way you look, it will be significantly more difficult to find something about yourself that you like/is ""good enough""). Our perception is painted by these negative thoughts, therefore the mind looks for external ""evidence"" (that is more often than not false evidence) that validates our internal experience. At times, that can mean seeing what is a distortion as something true and real. And that can be confusing and terrifying.

After having this dialogue for quite some time, those neural pathways in the brain have been reinforced, and are very hard to break free from. It takes conscious effort to create new neural pathways to replace those old, habitual thought patterns and behaviors.

If there's one thing I've realized along my own healing journey, it is this: No matter how much I try to change my body, nothing--*nothing*\--ever measures as ""good enough"" according my eating disorder. I wasn't happy with my body at my sickest, and I'm not necessary happy with my body in it's healthy weight-range. This connection we've made between changing our bodies and our overall happiness is something that takes dedicated internal work to untangle."

EatingDisorders,eubaa5k,t3_cfjwd6,1563643330.0,"I COMPLETELY agree, literally 100%. Recovery feels much different mentally when it comes from the person, rather than coercion of others.
There’s definitely value in the structure that formal treatment provides. I’ve spent the past 8-9 years cycling in and out of treatment centers, and there’s drawbacks to them as well. 

Accountability is often necessary, and it can be hard in the throes of an ED to rely on yourself. I have my parents helping me with meals/meal plan right now, while also having the space to select different foods and challenge myself, which helps. When something is forced on me, it doesn’t foster healing, in my opinion. I can see the reason behind weeding out “is it your ED, or is it you?” when it comes to taste preferences. However, just because we have an ED doesn’t mean we don’t have taste preferences like any other human being on this planet.

I can relate to you in feeling that you’re actually trying, which is so, so important. It’s necessary to clap for yourself every time you choose healing, choose YOU, over the ED. I also can relate on the refraining from doing certain things even though you’re allowed to; it sounds like we’re in a similar boat in terms of weight gain, and battling the mind game of “which feeds my illness, which feeds me?”

You are NOT alone in this. I’m so glad I found this Reddit community. The validation of the struggle with an ED is helpful."
EatingDisorders,euane6x,t1_euak8jx,1563626102.0,"The moments of clarity and improved mood are two key indicators that the body is using the energy you’re providing it for healing. It’s amazing what happens to a body that is under such physical and mental distress. It’s almost frustrating to think that eating makes us feel better, because it’s counter to what the eating disorder tries to convince us of. 

Kudos to you for choosing recovery. This is HARD work, without a doubt. I’m a firm believer in that whatever gets the motivation ball rolling, use it. If it’s external motivation right now, so be it. The internal motivation comes with time.  Wishing you the best in your recovery. ♥️"
EatingDisorders,euan3ol,t3_cfjwd6,1563625807.0,"You’re not “crazy” for experiencing these feelings, I can assure you of that. It sounds like you have a good sense of awareness about your eating disorder, which is key to be able to fight back against it.

Something that has helped me greatly is an ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) skill known as defusion. With defusion, you take a step back from your thoughts to notice and observe them for what they are: thoughts. This creates a degree of separation between you and the eating disorder (after all, you are NOT an eating disorder—you HAVE an eating disorder). Those thoughts are not facts,  or based in fact, for that matter. A template for catching yourself lost in thoughts could be:

“I notice that I’m having the thought that ________.”
“My eating disorder wants me to ___________.”
“My eating disorder is telling me that ________.”
“My eating disorder makes me feel ________.”

In practicing the skill of defusion (as with all of the therapeutic skills and ACT operates on), the goal is NOT to get rid of the thoughts (it just isn’t realistic, this expectation); the aim is to notice, observe, and accept your thoughts exactly as they are. The power lies in the ability to separate and differentiate between the two: what your healthy self is speaking, and what your eating disorder self is speaking. It takes quite a bit of practice, but I will say this is method has been a cornerstone of my own recovery.

I hope this helps. Please know that you aren’t alone in these thoughts and feelings. I’ve been here, too, and everything you’re experiencing, you have permission to feel. ♥️"
Wellness,eu9tqrr,t3_cff2p6,1563590544.0,"Based off of what information you shared, it sounds like the important nutrients your grandma needs will be best found in actual food—not a pill. 

There are  various supplements, considered “medical food,” that can aid in this problem. BeneCalorie is a calorie-dense liquid that comes in a small 1.5oz package. It can be mixed into foods (it’s best done this way, I wouldn’t recommend trying to consume it on its own), smoothies/shakes, and even other liquid nutrition supplements like Boost Plus/Very High Calorie Boost or Ensure. I, personally, would opt for Orgain—it’s a great alternative to the other processed liquid nutrition shakes on the market (less sugar, higher protein, more vitamins). I have been using Orgain for a few years for my own medical issues.

Meal replacement powders and protein powders are also an option, if she is able to drink. You can add in tons of nutrients that pack a caloric punch in a wholesome, nourishing way: whole milk yogurt, frozen fruit, nut butters, meal/protein powders, whole milk, premium ice cream (for a treat!). The key is to try to find something she might enjoy the taste of, so eating feels like less of a chore and more of a healing experience.

I hope this can help. Sending you and your grandma healing energy. ♥️"
