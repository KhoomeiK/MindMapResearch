(but i do?? i a way that i want to get better)

the biggest problem tho is my mom.  she doesn’t understand anxiety and depression and she thinks meds are making us zombies. i’m surprised she got anti depressants for my sister. my mom is more of an all natural lady and has told me eating better with help. nOT ReEally. ive been working out everyday and eating almost vegan for the past month and my anxiety is still so so bad. i hate how much it affects my life bc i practically cant do anything. and i just found out a lot of my other medical problems are because of my anxiety and depression"
