Despite that, I always feel well-rested in the morning. Whenever I have trouble falling asleep due to hallucinations or restlessness, I take an antianxiety pill. It works for me. It's all about following a very strict sleep schedule, and it has to be a priority to you. Go to bed at a specific time without excuses and without fail. Turn off all phones and computers. Sometimes listening to sounds of thunderstorms help me sleep when I'm having extra trouble. Regular excercise helps with sleep, too. Once you do something routinely, your body gets accostumed to the consistency of it. If you follow a sleep schedule precisely your body learns to get tired when it's the time according to your regular schedule.
