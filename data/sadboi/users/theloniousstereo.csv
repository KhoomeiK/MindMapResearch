They also need to do something about umps that have a chip on their shoulder who run players just because they have a bone to pick or feel they have to prove something. I don‚Äôt know any of their names but watch some of those Jomboy videos of the umpires running players who even breathed the wrong way. 

As much as I love the game there‚Äôs a lot of messed up sh*t going on in MLB and I think we have yet to truly scratch the surface of it all."
