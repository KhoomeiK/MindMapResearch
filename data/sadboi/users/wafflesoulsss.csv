My abuser used it to hide behind, it was very convienient for him, not so much for his kids. A military man who was supposed to help my family settle in when we moved to a new base tried to talk my mom into letting him spend some time with me in return for favors for my dad's career. 

She said she didn't report him. 
She didn't say she said no either. 
I would never imagine in a million years that my mother would allow this but I also think she'd be easy to manipulate or threaten and was also in a vulnerable position at the time.

Right, because forcing your daughter to say those things until she has a sobbing breakdown makes HER a smart, charming, wonderful human being!?

What's disgusting is that she's a terrible human being. You deserved to have kind-hearted trustworthy mother instead of her. I'm so sorry she did this to you.

I'm going through this as well (reparenting myself). It's hard to do and it feels really embarrassing even though it helps me so much. If it helps to sleep with a stuffed animal or read bedtime stories I'll do it. If it helped my ptsd to crawl through a football field of broken glass I'd probably do that too.  

Nothing childish about trying something that helps and taking initiative to do the research about how to address your mental health. A lot of ppl ignore/deny their problems and turn their pain on the ppl around them.

My husband encouraged me to try what Girlfriend is doing instead of constantly ruminating and researching the cruel reality of my trauma, which for me Became a self destructive thing, although I'm sure I looked very normal and mature while torturing myself. I learned a lot but I still suffered with little benefit.

 Being childish bc I never got to be a child was challenging and uncomfortable at first but it helps me now. My work is better, my mood is better, I turned into a more relaxed pleasant person bc of it.

It's healthier for me and my brain. If someone told me it was unhealthy just bc it was strange I would laugh in their face and tell them how cute it is that they think they know what they are talking about. The human mind is strange, complex, and mysterious. Implying that something is unhealthy just bc it is unexpected and/or strange is just as childish and simplistic as using a coloring book."

My narc does the same thing. A friend would see her posts and give me updates to make me laugh and she noticed that as time went on the narc started to copy my appearance and other weird things. We could tell narc was watching my social media and when I'd stop posting, the narc posted her perfect happy  best self and when I'd start posting again giving no hint of any fucks narc would suddenly stop posting at all or post something depressing. It's very pathetic. 

This is super weird but last time I made the same mistake I looked up comforting asmr videos with affirmations for trauma survivors.

The good news is that it's time to upgrade. There's someone out there who will treat you like royalty because they love you unconditionally as you are. They appreciate everything about you and support you in life. The narc was in the way of that, just dead weight getting in the way of a better partner.

I read in a book about cptsd that sometimes parents will blame the victim bc it's easier to accept that someone is ""a liar"" than accepting there is an abuser in the family. 

Your swan is sweet and perfect (◍•ᴗ•◍)✧*。"

It can't hurt to give them both more time to heal and process what happened regaurdless of who is right or wrong. 

Dad is a grown ass man, he will figure it out or he won't. It's not your job to teach him kindergarten social skills. This is his time to take initiative and show his true colors as a father. As of right now he's basically acting like a diaper baby.

It sounds like you love your kid a lot and want what's best for both of them ♡"
