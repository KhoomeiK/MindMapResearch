Anxiety,fnpr5qe,t3_g0yi6b,1587150483.0,"You commented on my post about Chest Tightness and it helped lots. I've experienced anxiety for the first time in my life during these past weeks. If you need to talk to someone, you're just a click away."
COVID19positive,fnpp57o,t1_fnpnw1o,1587149443.0,"Yeah, I guess tightness, then after a few days burning, no tingling. I'm pretty sure it's anxiety. It's been better today so hopefully it stays like this."
COVID19positive,fnm93zp,t3_g2gve3,1587067234.0,Thanks for your comments. Hope your anxiety eases off. I will try to relax myself.
COVID19positive,fnlin0t,t1_fnlfxm9,1587054198.0,I've also noticed that once or twice every couple of hours I cough one time as if to clear my throat even though there's nothing to be cleared.
COVID19positive,fnlfxm9,t1_fnle03b,1587052858.0,"I will, it's been driving me crazy but I've also been thinking, if it was something else, it would've already worsen, it's been more than 30 days now. Thanks for your comment, it's helped me relax a bit."
COVID19positive,fnldr4k,t1_fnlbfe9,1587051763.0,"Thank you for your answer, is it normal that the tightness persists for the whole day, everyday? It only goes away when I sleep. Thank you very much I feel somewhat relieved."
Anxiety,fndts0s,t3_fo6h6w,1586877341.0,"I have been feeling a hollowness in my chest for weeks with no other covid symptoms whatsoever. Sometimes the pressure in my chest is so bad I feel like forcing a cough, although I have ZERO need of coughing. I had never ever experienced something like this and reading so many people have has somehow made me relax a little. I feel like crying from relieve. Than you"
CoronavirusSurvivors,fndt4oz,t3_g14smw,1586876993.0,"I have been experiencing exactly the same feeling, weirdness and pressure in my chest. No need to cough, haven't coughed at all. Have been isolated since early March and left home only twice to go to the supermarket. I've had no fever whatever. I am almost 100% positive our feeling in the chest derives from anxiety/paranoia/panic since at least for me, this feeling happened at the middle of March, then went away, and now it's back for like 6-7 days. The times don't add up. I'm pretty sure it's anxiety. Quite frustrating."

Coronavirus,fjvb2nz,t1_fjvab4a,1583625230.0,"I'm talking about Milano you dumbnut which is the second largest economic power in the European Union. Italy's sanitary system is top notch and way above many ""superpower'"". I might have a few screws fallen but you're full-on retarded."
Coronavirus,fjv9fwx,t3_ff3l92,1583624462.0,"Shit has officially hit the fan big time. Closing down EUs second largest economic power is no joke. Here's to all the ""you're exaggerating"" mofos. Wait till it gets to countries with poor health systems since Italy's is top tier worldwide. This is getting out of hand."
