offmychest,fo5wxfn,t1_fnc9aqr,1587538398.0,I understand how hard it is. That’s okay. This isn’t a problem that comes with an easy solution. I’m rooting for you! You can get through this tough time :) stay strong and get stronger ❤️
offmychest,fn8zd4w,t3_g0aseb,1586754494.0,"I’m so sorry that you have to go through this. I’m not married nor do I have my own kid yet but I do understand what it’s like to have a shitty father. He never physically abused me or my mom but it was mental abuse. His words, his actions, his neglect. I blamed myself for even existing because my mom suffered way more than me. IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. People choose their actions. They may not mean their actions all the time, but in the end they still did it and that’s on them, and ONLY THEM. People CHOOSE to be shitty. People CHOOSE to change. People CHOOSE to love.  

What I’m trying to say is that you also have choices. Talk to him, make him be a better husband and father. If he can’t, that’s not your fault. You did what you could. Just because he’s the father of your kid does not mean he’s a dad. If he can’t be there for her emotionally then you and your daughter both don’t need him. Anyone can fill in the role of financially supporting her. If anything, she’ll grow up hurt if he remains in her life and continues being the way he is. 

From experience, it hurts so bad knowing that your parent is literally right in front of you yet they don’t take any acknowledgement into your existence. I grew up wondering why? Why was I born? Why does my mom have to suffer because of me? Why can’t he just love me? Think of yourself and your kid."
SuicideWatch,flc0vct,t3_fneywx,1585017167.0,"My best friend doesn’t know I’m suicidal, but I told her about how sad and tired I am. She said “you CHOOSE to be happy.” She also went through a lot a while ago and said she had suicidal thoughts at the time but she’s happy right now and doesn’t think that way anymore. I don’t think she understands that I’ve been going through this for almost three years now. I know she cares about me but that was the worse thing I could hear. “You choose to be happy.” I’m depressed. Sadness is only a part of it. I want to to be happy. If I was happy maybe I’d have the motivation to try again, make my parents happy, want to live. Sadly I’m so far gone I can’t choose happiness. I need it."
SuicideWatch,fk035n4,t3_f9d5go,1583739608.0,"(I am a female 16)Yeah. I still have a lot of things I want to experience and enjoy in the future but with the way I am right now, I don’t think all of my pain is worth it. I have some good people in my life and if I were to die it would hurt them so bad. For some reason that still doesn’t make me rethink these thoughts. The only person I live for is my mom. If anything happens to her then I guess I’ll go with her. I have nothing else to live for anyways."
AskWomen,fabck4x,t3_e83taj,1575921145.0,"When you try to make plans with them and they’re always “busy” yet you always see them going our with your other friends. When they never answer your calls but they complain about no one calling them. You know when they’re selective about your texts when you ask for something important and they reply instantly but when you ask to call or hang out they take hours or never reply. They leave you on read all the time. Worst of all, they make you feel uncomfortable for just being yourself. My best friend of four years does all of this and it hurts so much."
