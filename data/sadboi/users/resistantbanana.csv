Even if David were to attend and have a “meltdown,” what a learning moment that would be for your son and his friends about understanding and accepting people with differences.
People with autism or other disabilities/sensory disorders are not just throwing “tantrums” and “misbehaving” in the way that neurotypical children do. It is a direct result of how their brain functions and how the perceive the world around them. Most of the time, they cannot help it.

They do not see me pushing myself to run sometimes until I am in so much pain that I am crying. They cannot fathom what exercise addiction is and how it can negatively impact your social and work life. This only exacerbates my urge to continue over exercising and restricting because I feel that I am “not sick enough” for those around me to realize that it is a problem for me and to quit making harmful comments disguised as compliments. 

I realize this is unhelpful, but I guess my point in writing this is that you are not alone. It sucks when the people you love lack sensitivity.

Have a hired support worker or family friend (someone who is not a guest of the wedding but knows him very well) come along with your cousin. Then, if need be, he can be excused from your service if it becomes too much, and no one is having to miss out. If you decide to go this route, sit down with his mom and explain you’d like him to come, but don’t want him to be uncomfortable.

Sure, many families choose this because they love their child, but families who also love their child decide to explore options of residential living services. Most states have some type of funding available for adult services where the individual can live a fulfilling life and be supported by an agency that has professional staff members. This means they’d be able to live in their own home with roommates and be supported by staff to obtain employment and take care of all of their basic needs.
Yes, raising a child with Down syndrome may come with challenges, but that is true with raising any child.

AskReddit,et6j7t7,t3_ca32in,1562513813.0,"I was in college a few hours away from home. I was a very competitive cross country and track runner and began to develop symptoms of an eating disorder. Quite rapidly, things in my life became very dark. I felt worthless and helpless and I hated myself. The less I ate, the more I lost all control of my emotions. Often times I was burning significantly more calories than I took in each day. I was obsessed with weighing and tracking my food and my life was consumed with constant feelings of shame and guilt.

Finally, I decided to begin seeing a therapist. Being away from home, on my parents insurance and out of state was challenging. After a few sessions I learned my insurance would need me to receive a referral from a primary care doctor in order for my therapy to be covered. So I found a primary care doctor about 30 minutes out from where my university was. This was odd, because there were several doctors offices in town, but for some reason my insurance sent me to a satellite office out in the middle of no where.

I go to my appointment and the nurse practitioner is going through the mental health screening portion of my physical. I go on to explain why I’m at the appointment, and what has been going on in my life. She asks me more about the behaviors I was using and I was honest. She opened up to me and let me know I could trust her and that she had been struggling with bulimia for 13 years. She helped me feel loved and safe and encouraged me to get the help I need.

I proceeded to get a blood test done on site. I had not eaten all day and passed out in the chair. I will never forget her looking at me and asking if I had eaten that day, me shaking my head, and her telling me it would be okay. She got me a snack and made sure I was okay.

I remember leaving and feeling seen. I felt understood. I knew it wasn’t a coincidence that I had gone tremendously out of my way to go to this particular office for my physical.
