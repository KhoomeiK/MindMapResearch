Not to sound weird but I didn't really realise/accept that I was depressed until near the end of our relationship which I think is kind of because she was a escape from my feelings and thoughts, and for a while blamed it on me dropping uni but now see it's been there a lot longer.  Maybe something similar is happening for her and she's only realised it since the break up, and me telling her about my situation is the biggest thing besides the break up to happen for her for a long time, so it's easier to blame me rather than think annoy what actually might have caused it.

But yeah you're right, there's nothing we can do for each other, and I got myself you improve and keep safe.
