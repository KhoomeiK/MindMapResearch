Any secure man wouldn't care what his partner wears and he definitely wouldn't shame them for it. He would also be self reflective enough to see how he hurt you instead of attacking you for asking for help and calling out his behavior. He's just projecting his insecurities and you shouldn't have to deal with that. He knows he's hurting you, he has the full intent to hurt you. He wants to control you and put you below him just so he feels better about himself. 

Be glad that you're free but I would be weary of any ""apologies"" he attempts because that may also be another tactic to keep you in his control. It's very common to emotional abusers to ""apologize"" just so they can continue the abuse. Just a rule of thumb, don't accept him back just because he ""apologized."""

I also don't like when people try to dictate whether someone is being genuine in their craft or not (not attacking OP just in case it's taken that way, but it's a thing I see lol). And if they are just wanting to be trendy, it's none of my business anyways. I'm pretty sure Harry Potter and Kiki's Delivery service were big inspirations in my witchcraft journey as a kid even if I didn't label myself a witch back then.

People also have different connections with their deities. My connection with Loki, for example, is completely different from someone else (which took me some time to realize trying to figure him out lol). I also kind of like the slight juxtaposition between a deity and something completely modern like Starbucks lol, but I can't judge and say whether or not they're faking it because I don't know or care enough to be bothered by it.

For example, someone's idea of success for a youtube channel may be getting their first 100 subs, someone writing a book wants to publish a best seller, or you open up a business and make a certain amount of money a year. In most of these cases, it does depend on other people's interests (how are you going to sell a best seller if no one is interested), but it's not really for validation for who you are as a person it's more so a gauge of how far your work is reaching. 

The problem is knowing if it actually is genuine shit or if you're just being pessimistic. Of course there are things people can improve on, but what if they're trying to fix something that's not even broken? Or if they're relying too much on other people's opinions? Where is that line where you can say ""I know my work is good even if it's not getting the attention, I'll just work harder"" vs ""my work must be shit and I'm doing something wrong"" or ""clearly I'm not meant to do this üöÆ"" and I often have trouble deciphering where that line is.

I still love how you sort of assumed that I wasn't going to get any help and me ranting was all I was going to do. I needed to rant to rant in a place that's supposed to allow it, but it's too negative?"
rant,fio6g2q,t1_fio4s2c,1582577214.0,"I am getting help, I'm trying to help myself, my complaint is that I wish I didn't HAVE to...again, these are things I already said. That's the whole takeaway and I don't know how else to describe it it just feels like people are taking this as a blanket statement of ""my life problems are my parent's fault"" when that's not what I said at ALL. I'm just recognizing unhealthy habits they've instilled.

Who's ""innocent"" in this situation, it takes 2 to tango. I love how you added this whole backstory to my life though. Are you sure you're not thinking of your parents in my scenario?"
rant,fio1bdd,t1_fio06hd,1582574360.0,"You're clearly not understanding this at all. Mental health doesn't give a fuck if you have money or education, so stop acting like knowing I have these things will just make me not have depression or anxiety.

You clearly didn't read this because I clearly said that I'm trying to make improvements by having to re parent myself, I just hate that I HAVE to and that I have to relearn lies I've been taught as a kid. I could easily waste my life away and make the excuse that my parents didn't raise me healthily, but the fact that you're skipping over that detail says enough. I'm allowed to be upset about unhealthy parenting techniques. 

Idk why I'm even wasting my time to someone who clearly  didn't read the message and just sees ""brat whining about privileged parents.""

And you're not a better person from not being sensitive, that doesn't make you tough. God forbid I feel and express.

Also parents feeding you is what they're supposed to do. It's the minimum. It doesn't mean they're not messing up in other situations. Why do you think ""as long as x met, it's OK even if y is not being met."""
rant,fintdoa,t1_finc5iy,1582569780.0,The phrase literally just means treat your partner with respect......? Treating your partner with respect has nothing to do with being spineless and submissive. If you're assuming the hypothetical wife is a bitch that's a personal problem.
rant,finrtwf,t1_fin9cup,1582568941.0,"Yeah I thought that phrase was just about making your partner happy because she's your WIFE and not really about doing what she wants because she's a woman. Granted you should be treating women with respect, but I assumed that phrase was just saying, ""treat your s.o well"" 

I also think (it might be just me) that OP is blending their annoyance with that classmate and that phrase because I don't think that classmate understood the phrase either."
rant,finrguz,t3_f7twc6,1582568761.0,"To be fair, OP just said they were complaining which is fair"
rant,finrcvx,t1_fihm6ub,1582568704.0,Yeah I didn't get that one lol
rant,finrbne,t1_fimjcnh,1582568687.0,"To be fair, some of the rants OP pointed out are pretty dumb lol.... Especially the ""women should expect to be raped for wearing provocative clothes..."" she's not hypnotizing people to rape her, the rapist made that choice. Idk why anyone would complain about gatekeeping that üò¨."
