but basically all i took from that was to create the i3-plasma profile,

all the other customizations came from here: 

[https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Using\_Other\_Window\_Managers\_with\_Plasma](https://userbase.kde.org/Tutorials/Using_Other_Window_Managers_with_Plasma)

&#x200B;

Basically all you need to configure, is to load the KDEWM enviroment variable before starting kde, and you need to configure i3 to manage floating all the floating windows correctly.

I also made some modifications as well, you can have a look at them at my gitlab: 

[https://gitlab.com/nikgre/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/i3/config](https://gitlab.com/nikgre/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.config/i3/config)"

Got bored of i3, so i remembered the kde times, so i switched back to kde and integrated i3-gaps-rounded. Works pretty good after I changed my config severely.
