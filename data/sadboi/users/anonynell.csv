I know that’s true — the guilt isn’t mine. Somehow it’s easier to accept if someone else tells me it though.

I love those suggestions. Physical representations help me mentally in many ways. Example: tidying up helps my mind feel “tidy” somehow. I image what you suggested would serve a similar purpose. I’m going to try this!"

ptsd,f6fek5k,t1_f6f8uxq,1572813508.0,"Isn’t it great? *sarcasm*
My mother loves to rewrite history and make the past sound like an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Almost like I WASN’T there and know she’s making it all up.

So sorry you have to go through this."
ptsd,f6eznb7,t3_dr0tn9,1572809300.0,"Yep. It’s horrible.

My mother, who is one huge factor in why I developed PTSD, refuses to hear about my diagnosis. Any time it gets brought up (and I don’t talk about it constantly, I mean on the off occasion it’s relevant) she will sigh loudly and say “nevermind!”. She won’t hear of it at all.

Guilt on her part? Maybe. But it’s super invalidating and crushing.

My fathers new wife was also very offensive about my diagnosis. Essentially equates it to have a “tough time”. Like, a bad day at work or something. Saying that “women are ego trio always creatures”. I damn near lost my shit with her but I held it together. Grit my teeth and just walked away.

People are super insensitive and ignorant, either by choice or from sheer obliviousness."

ptsd,f1azwvb,t1_f1aq0oi,1569316689.0,"That’s actually how I was as a teenager. I was constantly surrounding myself with people that I called “friends” but it was actually really unhealthy for me because in an attempt to gain that acceptance, I did a lot of (negative) things that I wouldn’t have otherwise done.

It was weird. I was almost building a wall of people around me. Sort of a “better the devil you know” situation — even if these people aren’t always the best for me, at least I know the pain they’ll cause and at least they’ll let me hide here."
ptsd,f1azry1,t1_f1atk7o,1569316453.0,"Yes! This!

I think this pissed me off because I don’t like the fact that someone else can see past my bullshit when I feel like I’m disguising it very well.

I do care about people. I care a lot. And a lot of the reason I don’t want anyone to care about me is because I don’t believe them. Also because I feel like people take advantage of vulnerability because, in my experience, they do.

Something to chew on, I suppose. Thank you for the honesty!!"
childfree,ey702ud,t3_cvnvjn,1566868199.0,"I have multiple reasons:

1) I grew up in an abusive and neglectful household that’s left me with ptsd. I’d never harm a child — I’m actually a very loving and peaceful person — but I do not think I’d be a good parent because of my mental health. Children don’t need to be around all that (in my opinion) and children also trigger me pretty badly (too loud and messy and repetitive).

2) Because my childhood was so abusive and stressful, I’m very selfish with my life and my time. I don’t want to give anything up for a child that takes and takes and takes, endlessly, with (in my opinion) very little return. My childhood was taken from me, so my adulthood is all mine! I don’t want to have my decision dictated for me.

3) I am extremely selfish with my partner. Again, because I was raised in an abusive and neglectful household, I crave love and affection. I don’t want to share that with anyone else. I like to be #1 and that’s that. Luckily, my husband is the exact same way. We’re so wrapped up in each other, no way am I putting a child in between that!"
ptsd,ew8fk4s,t3_cm8bdt,1565208821.0,"Like patches of sunburned skin.

My entire body isn’t sunburned so, I can be touched perfectly fine in some areas. But the burned areas are painful, even from the lightest of touches. I wear lots and lots of layers of clothes to protect myself from the sun so I don’t get further burns and because the redness & blisters are embarrassing. Occasionally I’ll hit a corner or rub against something by accident and hit a burned patch, someone may hug me or touch me a hit a patch, sometimes my clothes simply shift and rub against a patch."
ptsd,ew3y0jl,t1_ew3xagg,1565098072.0,I wish I had some advice for you but I’m still trying to figure it all out for myself. Just know you aren’t alone. We’re in this shitty boat together trying to navigate these waters!!
ptsd,ew3wzfh,t3_cmqbwq,1565097274.0,"I can relate to this. My mother was very abusive and I was neglected as well. I learned how to care for myself from a very young age.

I definitely knew things weren’t normal — I remember recognising this when I was at other children’s houses. Observation of their parents and home life. But I just accepted this as being luck — some people get to be loved and others (me) do not. So, it was MY normal.

I think this was a coping mechanism for me until I could escape. Adulthood is when my trauma really took a major toll on me. It wasn’t until I was 19/20 that it started to ravage me. Part of me thinks it’s because I thought “as soon as I get out, life will get easier” but... it didn’t. Because I was exhausted and didn’t trust anyone. Even though living in my childhood home with my abuser wasn’t easy or safe by any means, it was the the monster I knew. The outside world became the monster I didn’t know.

It’s definitely tough."
CPTSD,ew3w5o8,t3_cmker2,1565096617.0,"This is the exact reason I’m so trapped in my past, my memories, and my trauma. I replay over and over — everything that’s happened in my life and the trajectory of my life from one moment to the next.

It’s actually very crippling because it makes me feel like my personality is just a bunch of compounded trauma and that my life isn’t actually my own. This type of thinking allows my trauma to own my past, my present, and my future.

It’s a constant fight to weed out the affects of trauma from who I’m meant to be."
CPTSD,evovemp,t1_evnui2h,1564659102.0,"That sounds lovely, tbh. I’d love to do that & stick with it. I need to get over my recently developed “agoraphobia” so I can actually do something like that.

Must force myself to leave this apartment for something other than a quick in & out at the grocery store. I’ve become a total shut in so the thought of being in a room full of people is intimidating!"
CPTSD,evov7e7,t1_evmt4hy,1564658929.0,"That’s exactly right. I’m not kind to myself at all.

I do need to try & parent myself the way I needed when I was younger. I actually quite like thinking about it like that — I’m going to give that a go. See if I can’t slow down & think “what would a good parent says to me right now” ??

Toxic shame really is something..."
CPTSD,evov2za,t1_evmsc4x,1564658822.0,"Ahh see, that’s my issue. I’ve been to a speak therapist to try & teach me to breath properly but... I just can’t. That sounds really silly, I know. But it’s super difficult for me.

Essentially, I sit here all day & try to force yawn & rock back & forth trying to get a breath. If I’m stood up, I have to bend over & pull myself back up to try & pull in air. My muscle ache so much from the labouring.

I feel like a total wacko saying this now. Idk how I’m even functioning as a human 😂"
CPTSD,evouwlo,t1_evmfq7m,1564658663.0,"I feel like I’m in a perpetual state of panic, honestly. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I looked up that book & I’m going to give it a go. Thanks so much for the recommendation. I think mindfulness practice would work better for me than meditation would, as I can’t do breath-work due to breathing issues being the main manifestation of my panic."
CPTSD,evmaq9a,t1_evm6stl,1564605495.0,"How do you get in to meditation that heavily? I have tried (and am currently trying) so many times but the focus on breath is what stops me. My PTSD manifests in the inability to take deep breaths so if I focus on breathing, I feel like I can’t breath. This is a constant in my life... if I knew a way to meditate that didn’t require breath work then maybe I’d be more successful with it.

It makes total sense, actually. Very nicely put.

You’re suggestions are very helpful! I actually do need a break but, unfortunately, I am the obsessive perfectionist type with CPTSD so, I put a ton of pressure on myself. I never leave my house — because I have total control here. Everything is perfect. In its place. Spotless. My day is planned down to the minutes. When I eat, what I eat, what I do at what times. I need to loosen up a bit but being perfects &... rushing around is the only thing that makes me feel worth a crap anymore. I’m constantly listening to podcasts which honest save my life. But it’s so difficult to rest.

You’re right. I am tired. I’m so so tired."
CPTSD,evm9s7t,t1_evm4bl5,1564605132.0,"I’m... glad you understand? I mean, I’m not because I don’t think anyone should have to live in that haze but, it is nice to know I’m not uniquely off my rocker.

You’re absolutely right. I care so much & feel so deeply, which in turn means I hurt deeply, that I’ve shut myself off from everyone & everything. I’ve convinced myself that I’m safest in this box & not caring is the way forward. I actually feel like I’m being incredibly rational but perhaps I’m not? Perhaps I’m being super irrational because nothing makes sense to me anymore.

The other issue I have is that I am the obsessive perfectionist type with CPTSD so although I am trapped in this prison of my own making & never leave my house... my house is spotless. Organised. I meal plan everything. I track my water intake. I schedule my days almost down to the minute. My obsession with being tidy & perfect & maintained almost drives me mad. My inability to control every aspect of my life... has driven me to be in complete & total control of the little prison cell that is my apartment. My life is rigid.

Maybe I need to... stop being so rigid. Give up that control? I don’t know how to do that. At all. I definitely need therapy but I can’t afford it, unfortunately. 😩

Thank you so much for the advice! I appreciate it so much. You’ve given me something to think about."
CPTSD,eu1782c,t1_eu12nk1,1563361843.0,"See, I’m not in therapy for it & haven’t been for a very long time. Mainly because I simply cannot afford it. All of my progress has been on my own. Occasionally I hit a wall & don’t know how to work around it. This is one of those walls.

I have no idea how to stop obsessive thoughts without turning to my crutch, which is busy-ness to avoid having free time to think at all. I can’t still still & quiet because I’m afraid of my mind wandering, which for a long time I thought was an okay coping mechanism but it’s not working out for me, clearly."

ptsd,eqjgnii,t3_byhoo6,1560104556.0,Yes!! I feel this constantly. It actually causes me to rush through most things... things that don’t need rushing.

Unfortunately, the situation that is ongoing is not in my control but do not worry, my safety and physical well-being (aside from the stress taking its toll on my breathing) are not at risk.

I do not have a therapist as I can’t afford one at the moment but I’ve had therapy in the past so I’m not totally in the dark."
ptsd,eqe52rh,t1_eqdu1vi,1559999437.0,"Honestly, this response is very helpful if for nothing other than you’ve let me be comfortable knowing that IT’S OKAY that I can’t “breathe with my diaphragm” like “normal” people do. You’re right — that’s exactly what I was taught. The whole hand on the stomach, don’t breathe with your chest. But it’s not easy to do and it tends to make it worse when I focus on it. Distraction is my only reprieve. I will definitely try counting breaths and see if that helps.

Also, I’ve seen Batdad, and I’m gonna take that advice and go watch more Batdad. Thanks so much!!"
