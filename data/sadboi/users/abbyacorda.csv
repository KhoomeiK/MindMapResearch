depression,flkf7wm,t1_flkasmx,1585239797.0,Hug a family or a really close friend
depression,flkf1s0,t3_fpd43t,1585239709.0,"No please don’t. Even though I can’t relate to what exactly you’re feeling right now but have a friend, a family member to support you or you can just ask them to hug you if you can’t spit the words out. I’d rather tell them my problems and sometimes I would yell out my problems to them. Don't be afraid to yell (if they are okay with it) or to cry your emotions to someone because they would understand what you’re feeling. If you’re having some sort of trauma, you may recover from it but it takes a while! So talk to someone who experienced what you're going through or you may talk to a psychologist. I hope this helps <3 🥺"

Ik my reply isn’t about recovering i guess? But I just want to open up sorry for wasting your time lol"

Even though there’s nothing wrong with my classmates (I FUCKING GLAD THAT I HAVE THEM BY MY SIDE) but... the school environment isn’t right for me. I get so sad at school for no damn reason!

March 5, 2020 I cried to my dad because fuck I don’t remember why I have a foggy memory... I’m pretty sure I cried because of how stressful it is to keep up with the damn school schedule and upcoming tests :("
