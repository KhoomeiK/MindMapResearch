Calgary,fnazpzn,t1_fn8p2fi,1586806695.0,I think itâ€™s just the fact that Iâ€™m quarantined inside and havenâ€™t really talked to someone in person In probably 4 weeks now. I donâ€™t drink caffeine or anything like that.  Yeah. Jogging might be helpful. Thank you.

Calgary,fkh0m9n,t1_fkgcw4i,1584183588.0,"Not all the symptoms, mostly fever chills some sneezing dry cough at the beginning. There was someone who had similar symptoms to me and they might have had it so I think its better to get it checked out and it be nothing than leave it if that makes sense."
Calgary,fkh0k51,t1_fkgd5oj,1584183511.0,"Not even that, just the automated message."

depression,fbsm03t,t3_ee58qm,1577057052.0,"Going through something similar so I can relate. I have a toxic abusive mother who had made me want to kill myself several times when I was in highschool. Physically and emotionally abusive. Now, in my early twenties, diagnosed with anxiety and depression, can't wait until I am financially stable enough to leave. You don't have to put up with that, family is not always blood."
depression,faidcvz,t3_e97egy,1576105172.0,"I feel like in general, people are selfish. Depression is real and it's felt by millions of people. I suffer from depression as well. It's hard to change the minds of people whose ideas are so engrained in them, and even though people usually don't understand problems if they personally haven't experienced it themselves, a little empathy and understanding goes a long way."
depression,fabayf3,t3_e8anzg,1575920448.0,"I feel you. I suffer from depression for several years now, and at my work everyone talks about parties and flexing at the gym, and I just can't relate. Don't seem to fit in much anywhere. I'm 22 but feel like I'm in my late 20's. Life experience and traumatic childhood has made me kinda jaded. I hope it does get better for you though."
