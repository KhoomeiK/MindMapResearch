I personally thought about participating in the EU equivalent if I would have such an opportunity but ultimately decided to not attempt it. My skillset is not good enough to compete with the best and I would not sleep well knowing I declined someone clearly better than me a shot. I also cannot support the ruleset. E. g. LCS players are demanded to be at least high diamond why cant we implement the same for TFT as well? It is crucial if we want a shot for a real competitive scene.

What helped me the most was to re-learn the fact that the earth is spinning and the sun is rising and sinking every day, no matter if we feel ashamed about our past or not. I would suggest you to channel those regrets and shame into energy to start something new, or simply start being a better self. I cannot say how happy I am that my mother forgave me the things I did to her by simply being clean and trying to focus on my life once again. Of course nobody will give you the money back or the time you invested, but it is never (and I mean never, as long as you can breathe) too late to start earning some money or working onto having a better time.

Of course it will take time to getting used to it and it won't start today or tomorrow to be instantly better. It is a process after all. But if you allow yourself to get better it will get better in the end. Maybe you should seek out to the equivalent of Anonymus Alcoholics for drug addicts, those groups can help you immensely, being able to go to a regular meeting once a week or once a month and keep in touch in person with people who are fighting the same fight as you are doing right now. 

I wish you the best and I hope you can figure out how to trick your brain! Stay strong!"
