 When you're an introvert, you like alone time and quiet, so something not as social as reading book kinda pleases you. Plus you get information. Actually most of the information and experience that we have.

When you're an extrovert, you like hanging out with people, and it's known that when you're in a social situation you can't really read books (or if you do, you just go through them). And liking being social and all extroverts tend to like getting information from other people.
