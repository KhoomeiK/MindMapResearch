The thing is she is a grown ass woman of 45 years, mother of 2 grown up children, but acting like she's still in high school. She's the stereotypical boomer, thinking that beating children up and ""giving them something to cry about"" is totally normal. I am 19 year old girl, she's being nice to guys, I think she have a more respect towards them, this is my first job and the first time our eyes met I knew she's already hating me, but me being me I didn't gave up right away and was being nice to her even tho she was acting like a bitch. And I wasn't wrong about her hating me from the very begining, it was the very first day when she was being a big pain in the ass so it's not like I gave her a reason to be like that, all I did was introduce myself. Sad, because I actually was trying to be good at this job but now I'm burned out, I really don't care anymore, I'll leave as soon as possible."

For example, I love horses, but I never learned how to ride, so in order to learn this it would require human interaction of a extend I'm not capable of, definitely not bringing this up in a conversation. Yep I like playing games, all day long, even tho it doesn't make me as happy as it used to. And that's the point when you feel like the most boring shit ever.
