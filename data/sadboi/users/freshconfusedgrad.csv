Once you start feeling better, you keep working on yourself so you can cope with your depression. From your edit, he is open to getting help and wants it so I dont think he is manipulating you- but I would still say to look our for your own mental health too. You cant help him if his illness is also making you anxious/depressed. 


But as of now, I think he wants to get better and get help. But I think what is best for him is to put him on a psych hold if he has good healthcare insurance.

relationship_advice,f4fwaqz,t3_dkieiu,1571575125.0,"I used to be bad at this so heres what I do:


Step 1: cut off and cut out all toxic emotional vampire-like people

Step 2: recognize the personalities and patterns of these toxic people(ie i found that super insecure people who don’t know who they are and aren’t actually trying to better themselves are the ones that I need to stay away from because they latch on and suck the light from you) 

Step 3: set boundaries. If someone starts acting a mess and expects you to hear their constant whining/emotional dumping, tell them “hey, I care about you, but I dont have the energy to take on your emotions in tandem with my own. I want to be there for you, but I cant help you if I dont take care of myself first”.  You can still talk about issues and stuff, but good people will *respect* your boundary. Hell, they’ll even ask you if they can vent to you or get help from you before thrusting an expectation from you. Shitty people will start pulling away if you are firm with your boundaries.

Step 4: look out for yourself and trust your gut! If your gut is telling you that a person is using you, pull back on all the help/immediate support. You’ll learn pretty quickly if that person is trash.


Step 5; be your own best friend/ only let the best people in your inner circle. Being ok with being by yourself releases you from the pressure and fear of being alone. When in this stage-THIS is when you meet the most loving amazing people in your life. They will come to you naturally and they will show pretty early on if they are reliable. THESE are the relationships worth keeping around. 


I used to be afraid of losing friends once my 3 bffs ditched me in high school when my dad was dying of cancer. But I learned that I am the main person looking out for myself and the people who really had my back where around me all along. Now, I have 4 people in my inner circle: my mom, and my 3 best friends(all in different circles from different points of my life). You aren’t weak. You aren’t a pushover. You just have a big heart and a lot of love- toxic people can sniff that out and suck you dry unless you develop the art of self preservation. It comes with time, but you’ll figure it out. 

It also helps to find a healthy outlet for the need to help people. For me, it led to me pursuing a career in healthcare.

Hope this helps!"

relationships,f0ggk6e,t3_d4qhap,1568599275.0,"He isnt mad that you asked for beer, he’s upset that he set a boundary with you, said no, and you have tried to test said boundary multiple times- and I get exactly how he feels.

When im hungry, i HATE sharing my food(even though 70% of the time i end up offering some to people around me anyways). One day I was starving at a resturant and giving my bf recommendations but he kept talking about stealing some of my food and splitting it. Me, being PMSing and hungry, said you could *try* some but cant have my food if you don’t like your own.  It led to a small argument where he felt that I was being selfish and I felt frustrated because i set a boundary and he didn’t respect it at the first “no”. 

It was obviously resolved but honestly, if you had done the research(which would have showed your bf that the beer was also important to you) he probably would have just gave you one. Not to mention, he bought them all and you didn’t chip in/offer to buy a beer off of him. I dont think you meant to irritate him/push his boundary, but you cant lead a horse to water. Honestly, the whole issues isnt that deep and if he doesn’t want to give you a beer- buy another brand."

relationships,ezp23om,t3_d1q298,1568031573.0,"Why do you want him back? He is a liar! Also you had nothing to apologize for. 

Lets look at the evidence:
You two make plans to be together.

He cancels and says he needs to do homework.

You then find out that instead of doing his homework- he went out to dinner with another female friend. Just the two of them. Like a date.

Instead of apologizing and realizing how shady/inappropriate that is, he turns it onto you and uses it as an excuse to dump you.

He was probably cheating on you or having an inappropriate relationship with that girl. If he wasn’t, there would have been no reason for him to not tell you that he was going to dinner with a friend."

I suggest that you BOTH go to couples counseling together so you have a neutral party mediate your conversation.

If you feel like you gave it your all and it still isnt working, then call it quits. Just dont give up until you’ve exhausted all options because this new chick may seem “perfect” but you’ll fall into the same relationship issues if you dont know how to work through these conflicts."
