I was the idiotic stupid sot that went the extra mile, that stayed longer than required, one of my colleagues refused bluntly to lift a finger if it went outside of the scope of his duty. I got worked out, he is going from strength to strength. It was not that he was a bad employee, he did what was stipulated in his contract perfectly, I exceeded it and did what was asked of me, and got used as a scapegoat."

Those that were expected to flourish buggered off to local universities (mostly law and business), the rest went overseas within a year after school. After 5 years, those nobody expected to make anything of themselves came back and was placed into high positions because of experience (keep in mind some of them had five years already), at this point, around about five finished their degree, and of those five, one or two had jobs. Great things were expected from myself, I went to university, from my class, five finished on time, 30 finished it, of that, seven had got employment, 4 of those in the direction they studied, 2 has achieved high paying positions (they were actively apart of every organization).  

Moral of the story: education while wonderful can only get your foot in the door, but there are classes at different universities that are in the same position as yourself. The factors that will benefit you
is exclusivity (different skills that you acquired above and beyond your education), the different diplomas and how rare they are in the workplace, and last but not least, experience."
