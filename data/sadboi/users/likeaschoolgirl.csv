Chances are slim that you'll be able to find a single in CHCRC but I'd also post to the UMass housing Facebook page because I've seen people there asking if anyone is willing to pull them in. It's a big long shot though.

I'd look in North apartments if you want a single room. That's where I was my senior year (until COVID) and I liked it a lot more than the CHCRC apartments. I have no idea the availability there either (and it is more expensive). Some people don't like North or Sylvan because they're farther from the center of campus, and I was initially really concerned about that too, but the bus system was perfectly sufficient for me and people I know who were at Sylvan didn't have a problem with it either.

You could also look into off-campus options. It could save you a ton of money and if it's close to a bus stop it's pretty easy to get to and from campus."
umass,fqxxj9r,t3_gk4rsg,1589739365.0,Check the Facebook page too! I know of one place that's only 465 and you'd have the whole place to yourself - only caveat is that you'd need a mattress. I opted not to take it because I can't afford/don't have a mattress and I'm alright in the sublet I'm currently living in (not sure if I'll stay all summer either) but I think the guy is still looking.

umass,fqxxcb6,t3_gl961r,1589739282.0,"UMass has been making a lot of efforts to distance from the ""ZooMass"" reputation. Although there's plenty of partying if you're into it, it's actually really easy to avoid it if you make sure not to live in Southwest. I've lived in the CHC and North and never had any issues with it. 

College is what you make of it and UMass is such a huge school that it's pretty easy to create your own niche and avoid the scenes you don't want to engage in."
Nanny,fqxopfc,t3_glgso1,1589735563.0,"My guess is that she's anxious because there are a LOT of parents that nannies encounter who coddle their children, and therefore if their child is remotely fussy nannies get nervous that if they aren't holding them, it'll reflect poorly on them. She may have nannied for families previously who took issue with her not holding them all the time, too.

I'm sure she also worries that it looks as though she isn't doing her job if she just lets them play independently. When I first started as a preschool teacher, I'd be on the floor all the time playing with my toddlers for fear of looking negligent. I grew to realize that I can still be an excellent teacher without being 100% engaged in their play. But it is instinct to feel like a good caregiver must give constant attention to their charges.

So in response to your questions:

1. It's normal in the sense that this is a profession where many nannies (especially now) work intimately and oftentimes partially supervised by parents, all of whom have different philosophies and judge them differently if they aren't holding their child at all times.
2. You would not look like assholes at all. If she genuinely believes that's how she should handle those situations, I would tell her that you think she's an amazing nanny, and that you've noticed an uptick in your children being needy/wanting to be held constantly when she isn't around, and you want to work with her to figure out how to minimize that behavior. You said you've mentioned it before so you could just say, ""I know I've talked about this a bit before, and DB/MB and I feel strongly that it would be best if you don't pick them up whenever they are whining. Please let us know if there's anything we can do to help explain this better or help you!"" And then you can explain some of the circumstances where you are okay with her picking them up vs. times you'd rather they be independent.

Your attitude is great and I love to see parents who encourage independence in their children!"

I think OCD is the same as any other mental illness - some days are generally going to be worse than others and that's dependent on a thousand different factors that might make you more vulnerable on any given day.

It's always something that's present, but my ROCD flare-ups come and go. Sometimes I'm completely free of the obsessions, other times it's sheer mental torment. My anxiety is more pervasive because I almost always have free-floating anxiety, but that doesn't mean I'm having anxiety attacks every day.

Edit: Depression in my experience is different. Even though all disorders impair daily functioning, being in a depressive state is often more difficult for me to get out of. Even when all else is going well, my basic self-care is just not there. Yes, some days I can rally and get through everything, but I still haven't consistently taken care of myself (eating and personal hygiene) for months.

As everyone else has stated, I'd advise blocking her on social media. You're NTA, but you do have that option, so use it! How often do you have to see her in person? 

If you really feel the need to confront her, then I don't think there's anything wrong with just mentioning ""I've seen some posts about x and I just wanted to say that if they happen to be directed at me, I'm very sorry that you feel that way and that my posts are hurtful.

I'm a proponent for small weddings to begin with, but if you decide to have only immediate family, then that would automatically eliminate her. If it's a larger setting then I'd feel it's a bit ""diluted"" so it's not like she would be interacting with you or him very much.

I don't think either are inherently AHs but if he fights for it and attacks you for not wanting an ex there, I would say NTA. It's a small price to pay to not have an ex at a wedding.

I think it's his right to want to invite someone he considers a friend, and also your right to be uncomfortable with a wedding guest. He is entitled to want her there, but he should also respect your comfort level.

Relationships are about respect, and that includes respecting other people's possessions. It's one thing if my boyfriend says ""I got sunscreen for us for the beach"" but quite another if someone made an expensive purchase that was meant primarily for personal use. In that case, they have every right to decide whether or not they're comfortable sharing it. 

Living together does not mean everything is fair game. Honestly, I get worried about breaking other people's stuff so if I were in her shoes I wouldn't want to take something expensive that doesn't belong to me on a camping trip. You're totally in the right."

She has done nothing to show appreciation for her children on their birthdays. Although it isn't always easy to stand up to an abusive spouse, if she allowed it to play out and/or participated in some of it (I'm not sure if she and/or your dad restricted you socially and were over-bearing), then that's even less of a reason to celebrate and appreciate her. The fact that you're struggling financially and probably emotionally right now, as we all are, and she was so insensitive and inconsiderate towards it is even more selfish IMO."

You already contribute financially and this to me would be over the top. It also seems unfair that he wants to get a 3bed 3bath simply so they don't have to share a room when they are only there half the time anyway, considering that will increase the rent in comparison to a 2bed 1bath or 2bed 2bath.

You never confirmed that he was cheating. His situation seems entirely plausible to me (needing two part-time jobs). Maybe the feelings diminished, maybe he wasn't in a position to make time for you as he was getting used to the new grind and needed some time to be able to devote more time/energy to someone else. 

Relationships sometimes just don't work out. It doesn't make it more fun, but it's not uncommon to break up with someone and then see them being much happier with someone else. Whether it's the honeymoon period or they're simply a better fit, it doesn't really matter and it's not your business. If it was a clean breakup with no proof of abuse/infidelity, I don't think anyone can be faulted for that.

What you did was definitely psycho ex-girlfriend and hurt an innocent girl, not just your ex. I don't know what the right thing to do here is, but I just know if I was the girlfriend and ex-boyfriend, I'd want the person to come clean if they literally caused a breakup. Hopefully you learn from this experience and don't repeat this behavior again. I know you felt hurt and I hope you can take the advice/critiques from other commenters here to reassess your actions and move on."

Everyone else has said it already, but you have no obligation to tell him about anything, especially after he emotionally abused you so much.

>I disagree because they said that after Baby#2 and still havent even after Baby#3.

Did you say that to them? If so, I'd say ESH/NAH... they're definitely irresponsible (does that make them an AH, though?) and I side 100% with your POV, but it's also their mistake to make and as hard as it is, I usually try to keep my mouth shut once I've stated my opinion. It's their life, their choices, not yours.

You're as entitled as anyone to voice your opinion (though better voiced as a concern than a judgment, and it sounds like you may have done the latter) but overall I'd say it's possibly a step too far to keep arguing with them once you've both said your piece.

Again, definitely side with your opinion, and don't think you're the AH, but they're entitled to their own choices. I don't know if they're really AHs, just idiots. I hope things work out for everyone's sake."
AmItheAsshole,fqu6otr,t3_gkqemd,1589653074.0,"NAH/ESH, I can't decide.

You're not an AH explicitly for what you did. You wanted what was best for your child, and regardless of his age, he is your child and has valid feelings. However, I do agree with others that if his phobia is this paralyzing and upsetting, you and your ex wife should consider seeking professional help - there are many evidence-based treatments for phobias that would be worth checking out. Moreover, I think you're aware that you over-reacted (so that was a bit more AH-ish) but I do understand how frustrating it must be when you were trying to do what was best and are getting chewed out for it.

Your ex wife came at this from the wrong direction, so that's where she's the AH. If she has established a certain routine in response to his fear of thunderstorms, she should have communicated that to you. It doesn't sound like she did. Saying that you will essentially emasculate your son by letting him sleep with you is a totally irrelevant argument. I would understand much more if she argued that he is of an age where she would strongly prefer him to learn to cope with these fears effectively and on his own, and that sleeping with him is going over the line.

Glad that you stepped up to be the bigger person and resolved it with you. It sounds like tensions were just high in general because ultimately you both just really care about your son, and kudos for smoothing that over."

Parents who ask people last-minute to watch their kids and then expect them to say yes always confuse me. It's a reasonable thing to *ask* (and I've said yes before if I happened to be free and/or liked the kids) but not a reasonable thing to *expect* you to agree.

AmItheAsshole,fqu5p5k,t3_gkmmst,1589652524.0,"NAH. And you are especially NTA.

You are electing to do what is best for the child. I always say: happy parents, happy children. If you are not going to be happy, then how is she going to be happy sharing your living space? You've made it clear that her grandparents are much, much better-equipped to provide a loving, attentive, and fun environment. They have literally agreed with you.

I understand if your wife feels frustrated, because even though she agreed with not explicitly having a family with you, she likely views this situation as different because it's your niece. Even though she was originally okay with you saying you didn't want to take in any child, the real situation might affect her emotionally in a way she didn't anticipate.

So you're definitely NTA. I can see where bringing up divorce could be heavy, but I do think it's probably fair for you to remind her that this was a deal-breaker. Sounds like you're making every effort and also making some pretty generous offers to come to a compromise. Good luck!"

Strict restrictions are never a good idea anyway; moderation, which it sounds like they have at your place, is always the best way to go. Your sister and BIL are by far the AHs considering they keep sending them back.

Also, you're not their parents. I can understanding wanting to impose some predictability on their teenagers, but honestly, at this age, it's not really any different from going to a friend's house. I'd be pissed if the parents of one of my teen's friends gave me explicit instructions while they were at my house. I get that you're relatives, but you live your own life with your own family dynamics and rules, and are totally entitled to that. There's a difference between ""I'd like my 2-year-old to try and stay on the same nap schedule if possible"" and ""you must enforce all of our personal household rules on our 12-year-old"".

Having an agreed-upon norm of talking a certain amount of time outside of seeing each other is different from that, and as you articulately point out, so is having a preference.

My point was that when we have leisure time, we are typically connected, but obviously work/school always comes first.

Not because either of us cares more about work, but that's kind of a life thing that you gotta take care of. So is, as you point out, a random phone call.

I've had awkward close contact happen before with dads too especially while trying to hand off a tantruming baby. 

If you do feel awkward, maybe wear pants/shorts or if you aren't already wear something under your skirt? I never wear skirts or remotely low-cut shirts to work because it's such a physical job with little ones, where I'm squatting or sitting criss-cross the majority of the day, and they tend to grab onto the neck of your shirt and yank it down anyway. 

I don't think dads are being creepy but it makes me feel super awkward if I'm like oh yeah sorry your kid's undressing me or I'm possibly flashing you since I didn't realize my shorts rode up when I sat like this but anyway he had a great day haha.

I think it's fairly common so I don't think it has anything to do with your DB specifically. You've been there for so long it's likely that you're kind of part of the house almost so he isn't really viewing you as like a person, if that makes sense.

Her abortion is none of your business to begin with. You have no idea the circumstances around it, nor how it must have felt for her emotionally. Did it ever occur to you that it was because she knew there was no way she was in a position to raise and provide and care for a child, and *because* she loves children, she knew she couldn't do that to one? What if she was raped? What if there was some medical complication that meant it wouldn't be a viable pregnancy or it would endanger her and/or the potential baby's life, or meant that the child would lead a short-lived life of pain and suffering?

If she loves children, can you imagine how emotionally painful being put in a position where the best thing for all involved would be getting an abortion must have been? No woman relishes in getting an abortion. You have no idea what else might have happened in her past fertility-wise, either. What if she's suffered miscarriages? And finally, she's in a position to carry her baby to term, which for all you know was her lifelong dream, and instead of allowing her to celebrate and bask in the happiness, you shut her down.

Either way, her abortion is none of your business. Moreover, even if she hadn't had an abortion, shutting her down like that - to the point of making her cry - was completely uncalled for and warrants an apology that I doubt you'll offer. You don't have to share her enthusiasm, but it's basic human respect not to snap at someone like that. Particularly when having a baby can be one of the most joyful, profound, special experiences that a woman (and in some cases her partner) can experience. Getting up and leaving when she pissed you off would've been better than doing what you did. Block her on social media if it triggers you so much."

Maybe it's because she actually gives a fuck about children and knows the consequences of bringing one into a world when she can't provide for it - what if she was raped? what if the father was absent? what if it was endangering to someone's life? what if the baby was going to lead a miserable, painful life with medical complications? what if she had no money or means to keep a child happy and healthy?

She must be even happier now knowing that she is finally in a position to have a baby and OP is a complete ass for tearing her down. We have no idea what she might've gone through in the past to get to this point."

You don't have to live in the honors dorms if you don't want to so being in CHC wouldn't tether you to that, and a thesis can still be good for your resume especially if you're looking to work in a lab. But if you're in a major that doesn't have a heavy research component then it probably wouldn't be worth having to go through all that. You do still get smaller class sizes once you're an upperclassman (at least in psych) so you might have to just wait it out until then if you decide not to go into honors."
AmItheAsshole,fqr6ni7,t3_gkallo,1589578586.0,"NAH overall. I'm relatively sporadic with my replies to most people; however, my boyfriend and I talk literally nonstop. We love to stay connected like that. Not all couples are that way, plenty of couples actually prefer space, but the problems arise when people have conflicting expectations and preferences as to communication levels. 

Sounds like you and your girlfriend are clearly not on the same page. She needs constant availability to feel appreciated, you probably enjoy her a lot more when you can have space from her. If you've explained that this is how you are and this is helping you a lot with productivity and your mental health, and she's still trying to guilt you, then that's her problem. 

I don't think it's whiny of your girlfriend to want consistent communication per se but it's definitely important that she be respectful of your needs and desires as well as hers. I mean, every couple hours is still perfectly reasonable IMO and more frequent than couples I've met who will go a day or two without talking.

But yeah, I get frustrated too when anyone other than my boyfriend is nonstop texting me and then ""yelling"" at me when I don't reply right away or sometimes take up to a day to get back to them. Like, I have 45 unread texts in my inbox right now, that's just how I am. So I vote NAH overall, but just make sure you're being respectful and clear and kind with your girlfriend and reassure her that (I assume) it isn't personal that you don't want to talk to her as frequently as she might want to."
AmItheAsshole,fqr5uqf,t1_fqqtkmy,1589578158.0,"EDIT: It's been brought to my attention that I misunderstood the commenter, so I wanted to clarify! I believe it's reasonable to have a *preference* for talking constantly, and to develop an agreed-upon relationship expectation based on the dynamic that naturally forms. For example, whenever possible, my boyfriend and I text/call nonstop, because we love talking to each other. This has been our norm for the past three years, and I suppose an ""expectation"" of the relationship but not in a non-negotiable fashion, just in the sense that that's what typically happens. That does *not* mean that we accuse each other of being ignored if something normal like work, housework, or other life obligations come up.

My original point was mostly that I don't think it's inherently an asshole thing to *desire* constant contact with a significant other, but it comes down to the circumstances and the couple (e.g. whether they have grown to expect constant communication), and to *require* something of a relationship is definitely unrealistic and unfair. The difference between desiring/preferring communication as opposed to demanding/requiring it is an important one that I didn't originally take into account.

Anyway, it was silly of me to have jumped in at all; I believe I was too quick to be overly defensive of my relationship (taking it as someone saying ""you can't have a healthy relationship with constant availability as a norm""), and that was 100% my fault. Thank you to commenters who pointed this out to me! I won't delete this because that's a bit of a wimpy thing to do (downvotes are totally valid, this was not my finest reddit comment by any means LOL) but I hope I redeemed myself somewhat!"
umass,fqr2oyw,t3_gkc1kp,1589576468.0,"Pros:

* Definitely housing. I was a transfer student so I got lucky and got an apartment in the honors college dorms my first year. In comparison to the few regular dorms I visited, yeah, more than worth it.
* I like the small class sizes. As a psychology major, discussion is hugely important in seminars, and while you can get those later when you take seminars, I'd imagine it would be nice to take gen-eds in that type of environment too. I got my associates at a community college and the classes were 20-30 people. I would've hated to take those in huge lecture halls.
* Small classes = easier to connect with your professors. But it's still possible to do this by going to office hours in a large lecture class.
* Looks good on your resume/transcript, but honestly not that huge of a boost. The thesis does give you more of a leg up than just the title of being an honors student.

Cons:

* Cost.
* Thesis is now required. I wouldn't say I ultimately regret doing my thesis, but I wish I'd thought it through more before I got stuck with a project I didn't love. I'm really proud of the work I did, but I shed many tears over it and it was pretty stressful. So that really comes down to the kind of worker you are, what you're passionate about, and your faculty advisor.
* I personally didn't find the level of difficulty to be super significant, as long as you get the right professors. But some people might find it more challenging - I'd say more students I've talked to have found it at least slightly harder. Professors are hugely important in terms of workload and grading systems, so do your research.

Overall, I'd say the biggest con is the cost and the biggest pro is housing. That being said, I was only in the honors college at UMass my junior and senior year, so I can't speak to the experience of being in it at UMass all four years. I'm not 100% sure how you drop honors but I have friends who did and I expect you just sign some paper. That'd be easy information to obtain from CHC."
Nanny,fqr1als,t3_gk5e2x,1589575740.0,"Even if they find someone that their child clicks with, you didn't do anything wrong. If there's anything I've learned as a preschool teacher at a daycare that at capacity has 64 children aged 2 months to 5 years on a given day, most of whom I've worked with at some point, sometimes you just aren't going to vibe.

One of our infant teachers was an absolute saint, everyone sang her praises, she was literally incredible and had a wonderful bond with most of the babies. But there was one baby that seemed to hate her from the get-go. No explicable reason why; she didn't do anything differently with the baby. But for whatever reason, that baby just did not like her.

I experienced the same with one of my toddlers. It was rough because I felt like a total failure that I could bond with 8 of my toddlers but this one just never took to me. Sometimes they grow out of it; sometimes they don't. Sometimes they go through phases of loving me to hating me (one of my toddlers legit made me cry because he was so mean to me, after months of adoration).

Just like there's other adults you sometimes meet where they didn't do anything specific to you but your personalities just clash, the same can happen between young kids and caregivers. 95% of the families I babysat for growing up loved and adored me, their kids were obsessed with me, but I had a few here and there where they dropped me after the first or second time because their kids and I just didn't vibe. I always felt awful because I was so used to being idolized by the families in my community and having such wonderful bonds with my kids, but I realized that I wasn't doing anything wrong or different, and it wasn't really anyone's fault if the kids and I didn't hit it off.

You can't win them all. It sounds like you did the best you could, and sounds like the parents are the majority of the issue, plus take into account how stressful this time is for everyone. But even if the parents were absolutely perfect and the world was sunshine and rainbows, you did the best you could, and there's nothing wrong with *you* if the baby simply didn't take to you. Yes, the majority of the time, with great parenting and the right skills and qualities as a nanny, you can forge a bond and things get better over time. However, if that doesn't happen despite your best efforts, that's still not your fault. You did the best you could.

Try not to beat yourself up. You'll get through it and get back on your feet, I promise!"

AmItheAsshole,fqkj644,t3_gj8a4e,1589428481.0,"YTA for your approach, but I feel the annoyance.

As an infant/toddler/preschool childcare provider, I can assure you that hearing your wife use ""baby talk"" with you will not hamper your 3-month-old's language development. It's absolutely a great idea to be talking a lot to your baby and responding to them (when they make a sound, react to it as though they're talking - e.g., ""I know, that is funny!"") and I do think it's good to talk like a normal adult at some points, but I think you presented it from the wrong angle, which is the only reason I erred from NAH to YTA.

There's nothing inherently wrong with what she's doing; it's simply annoying and cringey. I get it. When I hear parents say ""huggie"" and ""kissie"" and ""milkie"" etc. when they're talking to 3-year-olds, I cringe too. The problem is that you made it about the parenting aspect rather than acknowledging ""hey, there's nothing wrong with it and I know you think it's funny or endearing but this behavior is grating on my nerves a little. I was wondering if you could maybe try and make more of a habit to talk like that to our baby and not me as well.""

You could even open a dialogue about wanting to be on the same page when it comes to how both of you envision creating an environment that will best foster your child's development, if you are concerned about the effect her baby talk can have on that. Maybe pull together some research on the topic and figure out something that works for both of you.

I'd be super irritated too, but remember, she's doing her best and you're a team. I don't think you're a huge asshole, just that your approach wasn't the best."

You're acting so mature and it's ridiculous that she wouldn't be bending over backwards to have a positive relationship with you.

I wonder if it's possible that Jake is being overbearing with Melissa, though. My friend's husband was married when they started their relationship, but it was an amicable divorce all things considered, because he had been living like a bachelor/as roommates for years when they met and while the ex-wife was understandably angry, there was no heartbreak or anything. My friend and her husband's ex-wife actually get along fairly well, but for awhile her husband was the one who was uncomfortable with the friendship. I mean, some people can be weird just about their current partner being friends with an ex, even when there wasn't infidelity involved.

So I wonder if she was getting shit from Jake for having a potential friendship with you, and that's why she was acting awkward. It just seems like a controlling partner-type thing to be speaking for his wife, especially when you were completely taken aback, and he basically wouldn't ""let"" you address it with her.

You were in love with him for three years, and then he dropped that on you, and I completely understand how betrayed and devastated you must have felt (especially if you felt that he hid this the entirety of your relationship). I also see that you may have felt that his mother forced your hand. However, YTA because as you admit, you were well aware of the consequences of outing him, his sexuality is deeply personal and only his right to share, and every person deserves to choose the when, where, and how of coming out.

I don't think he did anything wrong by giving a fairly neutral excuse. Saying it wasn't working and the love was gone implies that it was a totally mutual thing. People fall out of love, relationships don't work out, and plenty of couples realize that and part ways amicably.

The mother was intrusive and it was nowhere within her right to try to convince you to get back with her son. A simple ""I did love the two of you together and I wish there was something I could do to encourage you to work it out"" would have been fine, but it sounds like she was badgering you for an hour. Your relationship was and is between you and your ex. His mother should not have meddled.

My heart goes out to you because I understand feeling overwhelmed and blurting something out, especially if you don't want others to believe something you know isn't the truth. YTA because you did not have a right to do that to him, no matter how pressured or upset you felt, but his mother also shouldn't have put you in that position."

Sadly I'm not living with my boyfriend because I got stuck 100 miles away from home during quarantine, but we do see each other weekly and he LOVES to cook and take care of me. That helps me a lot, because part of my ED's excuses is ""I'm too lazy to cook"" or ""I don't like what I have here"" and he cooks all of my favorite meals. I also love him and would feel rude rejecting a meal he made, so that helps guilt trip me into eating LOL. I loooove cheeseburgers but would never make one for myself so he does those a lot.

I'd definitely recommend seeing if you can find a dietitian, that's the first thing I did. They can at least give you educated advice on how best to go about increasing your food intake. You don't *have* to tell them your weight, you can say you don't know, but that you are positive you have lost weight and you want to start to recover from it before it gets worse.

One thing that helped me the last time I had a lapse was to schedule meals/snacks. I tend even when I'm not underweight to go like 7 hours without eating, but without realizing it, until I'm ravenous and hangry and miserable. My nutritionist at the time explained to me that there are many hunger cues leading up to feeling ravenous, but that my ED probably suppresses those and makes me less in tune with them. So I just started setting alarms every 2 hours to make sure to have a snack and have 3 meals a day. 

I would put together a list of snack options beforehand - a fruit cup, cheese and crackers, cookies and milk, granola bar, fruit and yogurt, bowl of cereal, etc. That's a good way to start to slowly increase your intake throughout the day. I made the mistake of going from a couple months of gradual restriction to eating a large meal and my stomach was not happy with me, so spreading out the times I ate helped my stomach adjust better."

I mean, we fell in love and got to know each other intimately over text, and finally being together in person just clinched it. We've also been long-distance for the past two school years, so we really rely on texting and calling to maintain the connection in between.

You're right, it's definitely easy to take a text the wrong way, particularly if you don't know that person as well in the context of texting or online communication. He and I have been on the nonstop texting train for the past three years, so we know each other's texting ""voices"" well, but in the beginning sometimes it was really hard for me to figure out what ""tone"" he meant a text in and it would cause misunderstandings. 

I do always prefer phone call/video chat though. We're limited with that sometimes but will spend hours on the phone when we're able to.

It touched on emotional trauma from my infancy, and my past experiences intensified the feelings of betrayal that I felt as a result.

I lash out at him in anger a lot of the time and it wasn't until recently that I realized that this trauma was the reason that I have been battling so much mental illness since and been unable to shake it. I learned that emotional trauma does not have to objectively be expected to be traumatizing, it doesn't have to be abuse or assault or infidelity - that it comes down to your personal emotional experience.

So I do flip between those two mindsets often. Anger, blame, resentment at him... then guilt because I know how much he loves me, how he treats me like gold, how he'll never forgive himself, so I should let it go. I'm not proud of the things I say to him when I'm angry. I don't question his integrity as a person, but it does get to the point where I am constantly questioning whether I should leave him because of the emotional trauma and the ROCD behaviors it triggered. I can't bring myself to because of the incredible moments and how in love we are and our passion and chemistry. But it causes a lot of stress grappling with my own brain.

Please don't invalidate yourself or question why you are still upset. Could some people have moved on by now? I'm sure they could have.

For example, I have ROCD. Even though I know a situation didn't happen between my boyfriend and an ex, my brain does its best to convince me that it did.

If I don't perform a goodnight routine with my boyfriend and say or do certain things, I am convinced that something bad will happen to him. If I'm angry and even for a split second wish something bad upon him, I really do feel terrified that it will make it happen.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I hope you're able to find a treatment that works for you!"

I wear a kid's size 12 and the inseam on those sized pants are almost always the only ones that fit me, even with petite/short sizes. However, it saves money and I'd honestly 100% recommend giving it a shot to avoid Talbot's prices! You really can't tell the difference, depending on the design of the pants. I love Gap and Old Navy girl's jeggings. So, so comfy and the perfect length.

Also, oftentimes dresses or skirts that are designed to be mid-thigh come to my knees, which makes me look even more like a 12-year-old. However, I can rarely go with kid's sizes for dresses or rompers, because they are built for prepubescent girls with no chest. I'm only a 36A/34B, but that's still bigger than the tops are designed for and they fit weirdly or are too tight up top. I've found the most luck shopping at SHEIN for everything but pants/shorts as their clothes generally tend to be designed for more petite women!"
Nanny,fqf0mt8,t1_fqeza6i,1589316731.0,"I will say that right now things are extremely stressful for everyone in the world, so I'm unsurprised that you'd see regressive behaviors or increases in acting out. However, if he's getting free reign at his mom's house and then your nanny establishes boundaries and discipline, that could prompt lashing out. Consistency is so important for young children, and even as a preschool teacher, when the parents and I aren't on the same page, it's evident in the kid's behavior. If consequences and expectations are different between your house/your nanny and his mom's house, that can be disruptive. 

It sounds like the aggression began provoked, and has started being unprovoked, which I might attribute to everything that's going on now. It can be a heavy talk, but have you or his mom opened any dialogue with him about the COVID stuff? Kids are sensitive and they notice when things are different and pick up on adults' stress, even if they aren't reading the news or aware of the full breadth of it.

Also, how long have you been divorced? I'd wonder if there is some element of feeling resentment towards what he might perceive as a replacement for his mother - kind of like when the divorced dad gets a new girlfriend. Especially considering this has been happening pretty much from the get-go."

Nanny,fqev3lb,t3_ghynd2,1589314088.0,"I agree. I think job listings shouldn't necessarily advertise the kids' weaknesses yet, unless there are clear important things to mention (like disabilities, allergies, major behavioral problems, etc.), but if their parents are labelling them as perfect, then that's definitely a concern in terms of how they might handle discipline and any work I might try to do with their child. Sometimes parents don't realize that seasoned professionals are literally expecting kids to have tantrums, to be messy, to act out, to be imperfect. So they try to somehow convince nannies ""my child will be perfect"" without realizing that nannies anticipate and want to help kids grow and change and mature."

It would be one thing if your dad's wife was at least decent to you - of course cheating (his decision) is never right, but if I was *ever* in her position, I would go above and beyond to do what I could to treat the people that my relationship harmed with kindness, compassion, patience, contrition, and love, and hope that over the years they may be able to move past the pain and be open to a positive relationship. I'm doubly appalled that she taunts your mother and is so mean to you. I mean, she didn't even say ""Is there any way you could give me a hand?"" she literally just went straight to nasty and lashed out at you with snark. Ironic that she's lecturing you about ""basic decency""."
Nanny,fqet0o8,t3_gif5ax,1589313108.0,"I think it also depends how it's presented by the pediatrician.

Anxiety,fqerq8p,t1_fqeoakx,1589312500.0,"Do you have anyone else who can take you driving? When I was learning, I could never go with my mom because she was a basket case. I didn't love driving with my dad but he was more relaxed. I'm sure most things are closed right now but are you also enrolled in a driving school? That's where I really learned to drive and get comfortable.

You need to trust your brain. Your anxiety is trying to second guess it. I mean, you're already paying attention when you're walking, you just don't realize it. You're making sure you're staying on the sidewalk, you're avoiding other people, maneuvering around obstacles, when you get to a crosswalk you (hopefully) look both ways and look to the side to make sure nobody is turning. I know it's scarier being in a car, and there are obviously other aspects to keep in mind that are more complicated than just walking, but you also have to give yourself credit that you're already able to pay attention to a lot of things just while you're walking around in your daily life. 

The other things will become second nature. Take your time, go slow, do what is safest for you, and trust yourself. But for now, just start small and take a deep breath and remind yourself that you have control and you already have faith in your ability to pay attention to multiple things at once and navigating safely through a space - you just happen to be inside a vehicle this time.

What particular things do you feel are overwhelming to focus on? And if you're in an empty parking lot, there's no way for you to hit someone right? That's what I would assume is the benefit of starting in an empty parking lot - knowing there's nothing for you to hit!"

There are undoubtedly cases where previously trans-identifying people grow up and realize that they are cis and it was internalized homophobia, for example, that led them to initially identify as trans. But that absolutely does NOT mean that parents should disregard their child. I understand where the potential to change their mind comes in when it concerns hormones, etc. but I don't understand when parents use that as an excuse not to respect their child's gender identity and expression.

ROCD,fqekhhm,t1_fqej178,1589309054.0,"Thank you so much! Part of it is that I *don't* have a past, so it's more difficult for me to put myself in his shoes. I'm a really open person and have no taboo subjects despite a convoluted past in some ways, so to me it's like, why would you not want to talk about it? 

He obviously gets extremely uncomfortable when I push him about his sexual past, because he says that he realized after being with me that he did it just to do it and didn't enjoy it and feels ""gross"" that he did it in the first place (I REALLY try not to go there, but on bad ROCD days sometimes it comes up). Though he doesn't always say it, I also think he feels bad that he settled with previous long-term partners (one was abusive, the other he stayed with because she wasn't abusive and to him that meant it was a worthwhile relationship) so I'm sure that constantly being grilled by me about it makes him think about life choices he isn't particularly proud of. 

I've just always been really confident in what I want in a relationship, what a relationship should look like, and I waited until the right person came along and our relationship (other than my mental health struggles) is better than I could've hoped for. So I'm confident and don't have any past relationship regrets, but I need to be more compassionate and understanding to those who might not exactly love looking back on experiences with exes. I'll definitely try to take your and I'm sure many other people's words for it who are in happy healthy relationships after a history of not so great ones going forth!"

Sounds like she is one of those ""everything is racist/sexist/phobic of someone"" people who either genuinely takes everything personally, and/or for whatever reason thinks it's okay to take out her own frustrations (perhaps feeling defensive of her religion because of anti-Islam sentiment, even though I don't think you've expressed it) by slamming you. Your Muslim friends should've come to you to get the full story, if they are friends with both of you. If they cut you off because you didn't give into someone pushing their religion on you, then those probably aren't the type of people you want to be friends with anyway!"
AmItheAsshole,fqeierk,t1_fqeghpp,1589308068.0,"If she's okay with you mostly doing what you want, then she might just be all talk. She probably feels the same as your dad (just wants to make sure you're safe and accounted for), but she expressed it in a ruder, more personal way. I'm 23 and still grapple with overbearing parents. I traveled a 2-hour plane ride away with my 27-year-old friend once to stay with her family friends for a few days and my mom was like ""I want her parents' phone numbers and the phone number and address of the place you are staying.""

It definitely isn't okay that she does things without your knowledge. That would drive me crazy (I've lived some aspects of helicopter parenting, and it was awful) and I wouldn't just sign my kid up for anything without telling them first or giving them fair warning. 

Have you tried to talk to her about it? I don't think you should remove her, but I think you should explain your feelings and that your frustration has mounted to the point where you considered it. Obviously validate that you know she cares about you, wants the best for you, and is concerned for your safety - but the way she's showing and acting on that is pretty misguided."

Being uneasy 100% makes sense. I also think it's a *bit* presumptuous of him to expect exclusivity while he's living with an ex, but also up to this point you were never an item, so that's quite different from if you were in a committed relationship and he moved in with an ex. Like, if your boyfriend of 5 years moved in with his ex-wife or something, that would be much bigger of an issue IMO than a love interest (not even a boyfriend) living with an ex (not sure how long they were together/have been broken up). If he's exploring simply dating you, that's different.

INFO:

1. How many feelings have been involved in your relationship with him over the past 4 years? Has it been FWB/mostly physical, or have you mutually expressed romantic feelings?
2. What is his relationship dynamic like with his ex? Are they close or are they just living as roommates? 
3. Does he seem like he still might be attracted or have feelings? It's possible for people to break up and remain good friends with completely platonic feelings. 
4. Do they have a history of breaking up and getting back together? 
5. How long were they in a relationship? How long have they been broken up? 
6. Is this living arrangement temporary until she has a place to go?"

Even if your mom says that, how much actual freedom do you have and how does she respond? Before quarantine, where were you allowed to be on your own?

(with elements of ESH and INFO)

To a degree, your participation in some aspects of her religion may have misled her to believe you were interested in adopting it. Her interpretation of that was understandable. If you never corrected the misinterpretation, then that's a little bit on you. However, if you didn't expressly ask her to, and she didn't stop if you made the request, I never support unsolicited religious counseling and would be inclined to say her behavior wasn't called for.

Her comments also weren't even strictly religious. Criticizing the length of your dress, being upset over your personal choice to drink, and directly insulting your religious beliefs are unacceptable to me, and her using religion to justify those comments is where I draw the line.

I don't think you were specifically Islamophobic, because as you expressed, you think *all* religions are baseless. That being said, Islam is included in ""all religions,"" so that accusation could really go either way. *That* being said, she should never have told you that your religious beliefs are stupid, and then expect you to be respectful of her religious beliefs. That's hypocritical.

You could have been nicer, but if you had been politely resisting her up to this point and that was the final straw, I understand why you snapped. I think adding ""so is yours"" when saying that you think all religions are baseless was where the message went from ""you know my religious beliefs, I do not agree with any religion"" to attacking her religion as well. But all things considered, I think there are far harsher things that someone might have said in that situation and you didn't.

INFO:

1. How much did you express frustration leading up to your outburst? Did you go along with the entire thing or were you resistant and asking her to cease and desist the entire time? How would you react to her criticisms?
2. What is she saying about you? There's a difference between her telling a close friend ""so-and-so said this, and I feel like it was Islamophobic"" but giving the entire history (including acknowledging her own pushiness), and just telling everyone you're Islamophobic either with no basis or taking your final comment out of context. She could be venting, or she could be being malicious and trying to get back at you by sullying your name.

Taking all of this into account, I do vote NTA, but the degree of responsibility and assholery you have in this conflict is dependent on more information."
OCD,fqe6q0q,t3_gi5z2i,1589302645.0,"Absolutely. One of the worst things for me is that with ROCD, people tend to give unsolicited relationship advice, which only worsens it. I was asked once by someone who knows *nothing* about my relationship whether I thought that my ROCD thoughts were trying to ""tell me something"" and ""being smart"". That's like asking someone with HOCD if they think their thoughts are legitimately predicting that they're going to hurt someone and they should be cautious."
unpopularopinion,fqbgji4,t3_gfwegv,1589236561.0,"I will say that as a 5'0"" young woman, I find it tremendously difficult to find clothes that are fitted enough that I don't look like a tween trying to fill out my older sister's shirt. I tend to shop either from kids/junior sections or Asian brands, which often either go down to XXXS or run small for western sizing standards. I don't know if brands should be exclusively marketed/targeted at skinny people, but then again there are plus-size focused brands. I think it's linked to the same underlying reasons that skinny-shaming is often dismissed or even enabled, whereas fat-shaming obviously is not. Body positivity and inclusivity can definitely tend to hyper-focus on people living in larger bodies, and in the process end up excluding or marginalizing those who are slimmer."
disability,fqbfsx0,t1_fqb9gvp,1589236173.0,"Perhaps I misunderstood, but I thought OP was asking about this not to force any regimens on their father, but to maybe bring it up with him? I think there are *some* tactful ways that you can broach the subject with a loved one, particularly if it's framed as a team effort, e.g. ""I love you and quarantine has gotten us all in a slump, I want to make sure you are as healthy as possible and wanted to float some ideas by you \[insert ideas regarding changes in diet, etc.\]"". But saying something like ""I've noticed you've gained weight and I'm taking it upon myself to help you lose it"" can definitely be damaging.

I do think directing him to the doctor would be the best idea, but I'm guessing the current situation prohibits a weight check type appointment. OP also said ""I would really appreciate any ideas on stuff we could try to help him be healthier"" so I think that the ""we"" might imply that there are multiple people on board, possibly including their father. There wasn't really clear information here regarding the father's level of involvement so I think a lot of this has become conjecture!
