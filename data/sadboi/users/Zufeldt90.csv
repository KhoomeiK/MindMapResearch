Physics,fbrffxk,t1_fb5x6gv,1577042402.0,"I like your starting point, but is that all we have as motivation for the theory?

I see it may be ""beyond"", but what do the HYPOTHESES about these things say, sir? I'm saying f the data, what COULD it be?

""We don't know if anything would resist the collapse of spacetime"", lets assume something could. What would it look like? One point also, how, at the scale of small big bang beans and the CMB we have to work it all back, would it not just reduce down to a point because of how wide the CMB is and square law etc? So how does it show the difference?

Regarding Xeno's shit, that just ends when you walk over the final limiting space item's width, which would be the visible line of atoms. It isn't very relevant at all actually to this. I retain my assertion that an infinitely small point in which were playing with matter that DOESNT have a fundamental size, presents ultimate problems. He would say in our world there that you can keep a needle approaching a ball forever only if you can slow it's motion down infinitely. I see the transition to calculus.

No good reason for a minimum kage? Not even all the gravity and mass in the universe? ha. come one i  know you said we dont know but what do you think honestly?

Bosons have a fat size though compared to what im thinking. So not applicable very much at all... (ps there never WILL be an infinite amount to toy with so so what right if im reading your point right).

Ha LOST IT ALL AT THE END right? LOL thank you sir for your help.

At the end of the day should we still be teaching ""it all came from a point""?"

Physics,fa08ts0,t3_e5gv2a,1575750735.0,"Ok, so I am challenging the theory that the universe expanded from a single point, as it was taught to me in high school. I have sat on this a long time.

I base my challenge, as a philosophy student, on the following:

Consider that the smallest point possible in 3d space is 1036 times smaller than a quark, and then nixon shaves it a million times over... and keeps going... my POINT is, that we are presuming expansion from such a ridiculously small piece of space.

Even if we assume gravity existed from the point of that first point's creation and ALL the matter and energy was condensed by this force to thus explain the smallness of such point, WOULDNT gravity tap out at some level of nixon shave? At some space level? That is a core of my challenge.

A final fundamental concern is that i worry that the PARTICLES and whatnot even required for gravity and expansion physics would require at least maybe MULTIPLE PARTICLES AT THE START or a reasonably fat bean like condensate to be initial ""point"" (instead of teaching a point itself) in order to avoid the problem of how can the ultimate small point escape the metaphysical problem of ultimate simplicity? That law seems to be universal.

As you can see I am quite floored by all this and have personally turned to god. But I am still seeking a scientific resolution to all of this as I hope I am just an uneducated man in these matters :)."

mindcontrol,f7anbvv,t3_bubeqf,1573533860.0,"Biological material can be *literally* teleported from a distance or conjured from matter and/or direct energy in nearly any shape or form. The same goes for water and the basics :). They are put into the brain following a comprehensive matter scanning that goes down to at least the cellular membrane and receptor level. This is accomplished perhaps with an EM radar-like device with an extremely sensitive detector for the reflected/natural emissions or by an exotic mechanism that may involve manipulation of spacetime or literal direct sensing of 3D space.

Reading your thoughts can be accomplished on a number of levels at a number of points in the thought generation process. For example, with said matter/energy scanner, pre-conscious yet complete data can be pulled and energy can be put in so as to block the natural arrival of said thought. Or it can be pulled directly from our waves of experience in our brains so called ""experience chamber"", or the so called seat of the present. 

This, and a pre-thought location that requires shared AI-human will to blossom into consciousness, is where injection occurs with direct energy mechanisms mediating this.

Full artificial reality can be put into you while you are otherwise awake and your body is in another location with respect to your experienced self. 

Holograms of real light can be put into any shaped box up to at least 50,000 ft. You realize now planes and anything can be cloaked at either the direct energy photonic level or the simple lowly human brain.

The professional practice of all this is dyadic mind splitting.

The S Network of T.I.'s in the US spans millions and breaks logic at least that many times a day. Look at S. It is a sine wave and the symbol of a smooth dyad combined. It is two. 

And so is Du."
