seniorkitties,fpt7tgt,t3_gf9me2,1588886380.0,"My baby had her first seizure at age 14. 

What I learned:  Seizures are not uncommon in older cats.

They can be a result of an underlying condition like someone mentioned, such as kidney failure. This why the vet is key. My cat is in good health though. She has it 'just because'. 

There is such a thing as noise induced seizures. Other than the first one my cat has had them from a noise result only. A chip bag sent her into one and a haphazard search through a junk crate another time sent her into one. Even if she doesn't seize, please watch your cat when you make noises, she likely will twitch (which is a minor seizure) if noise sets her off. 

SInce mine has them infrequently she doesn't take anti-seizure meds. If you go down that road then you must give meds everyday at the same time or she will seize from withdrawal. If it comes to it I will go that route if it is a frequent thing.

Regardless, senior kitties should go to the vet every six months for a senior panel. The common illnesses in elderly kits will be caught early then. Remember six months to us is like years for a kitty!

I wish you the best. Seizures are scary. My kitty has no idea where or who she is when she comes out of it, as well as being blind and paralyzed (that she recovers from). I never know how for sure to best comfort her."
