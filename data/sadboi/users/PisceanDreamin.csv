LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiy3hul,t1_fiy2ro2,1582831768.0,"Agreed. I thought it was so sad when he addressed everyone after she walked away and the camera goes over to Kelly's mom. She is like ""I love that guy"". Everyone could see it but Kelly."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fiy2qbc,t1_fiy1x5t,1582831331.0,I definitely don't think Kenny knew that he was getting left.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fixydhf,t1_fixxyve,1582828859.0,His Jessica pleasing desperation got super annoying. I could tell that Mark was too willing to give into anything Jessica wanted. He never saw himself as more than just an option.

AskReddit,ew1oxua,t3_cm7dp1,1565028177.0,My 6 year old is hiding Lego pieces every where. I step on  the little landmines all over the place thanks to our stupid plush carpet. It's no accident. I hear his creepy little laugh when I scream after stepping on one. I've caught him a couple times plotting against me.
Anxiety,ew1je5d,t3_cma5p9,1565024671.0,"You took a huge step. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist in May and I was absolutely an anxious mess at both appointments. 3 months later and I now wonder why I waited so many years to get help. 

I hope you get good results from the psychiatrist with whatever interventions work best for you."
Anxiety,ew1iy94,t3_cmc4gm,1565024395.0,That's so awesome! It always feels amazing to have a win. I hope you continue to have these moments.
Anxiety,evyln8b,t3_clxc39,1564935571.0,"I know the feeling very well. I experienced it during the beginning of a relationship with the love of my life. It was like everything was too good to be true and my anxiety always made me feel inadequate like I was going to mess everything up. It was only until I realized that person was really here for me and that I have the capability to make others happy that I could relax. Look at it like this, you feel like your new friends make your life happier and brighter, but have you ever considered that you do that for them? That's why they want you around!"
Anxiety,evyk1il,t3_cls7pi,1564934493.0,"Thank you. This past few months have been absolutely horrible. Everyday, I pray is a day closer to getting my life back to normal."
