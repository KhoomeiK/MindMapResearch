The world I want isnt worth the work.
The world I get isnt worth the stay."
SuicideWatch,etewjiw,t3_c40k9f,1562750308.0,"I don't bother telling or showing it to those around me. Really all it would do is stress them while I am alive and raise the chances of it. I am getting tired of dealing with it. Think about it even when I am not sad. Kinda just plan on doing it after the ""ez teens"" is over and then gonna go dark. No one talks to me even when I live with them so disappearing to a ""new state"" aka a rock and the ocean. I wouldn't even be noticed. 
So far behind in life and even if I wasn't, I am so alone it still wouldnt be worth the grind."

My goal is to live. Cus yuh know, you wont win those numbers, so heres my start

Ride the fastest away and have the fire wolves just slow down the faster ones, at some point we will turn and fight those who were fast enough to catch up and then try running off again while the rest stay and fight. 

Dire wovles pons, bot mid my knights."
