latebloomerlesbians,fpjrvqi,t3_gdut2f,1588679196.0,Wooo! Congrats.  My first thought was that dating is dating. Just with someone much softer and idk. For me it just felt right saying women.  Have fun!

GriefSupport,foaulk7,t1_foargrv,1587652745.0,I totally agree.  My mom was 65 and was diagnosed at 60. It’s like none of this should have ended up this way.    I wish I had a smash room or something
GriefSupport,foaoggh,t3_g6m0sz,1587649955.0,She looks like an awesome person.  I’m so sorry for you’re loss. I’m really angry my mom died from dementia.  I think it’s a effect from grief.   Hang in there
GriefSupport,fo91p7j,t3_g6aagc,1587608552.0,Thanks so much. I’m so sorry about your dad. Not having a funeral must have been really hard.  I talk to her all the time but haven’t felt her around me much lately. Writing a letter is interesting.  I’ve been just really lethargic and feeling sorry for myself. Time to do something more productive!

They had no idea. So don’t get freaked out by that. It wasn’t the easiest and me and my dad just don’t acknowledge it since I told him.  Feels good to get it off my chest.

GriefSupport,flqfi7i,t3_fqcgbb,1585392603.0,I’m having a tough time with that too.  It seems like you just went through a lot.  Maybe did now an online community? And then let this time give you a moment of peace to chill after everything has happened?  It seems like you have a lot going on that your fam could have supported you with.  I’m sorry about your losses.  I miss my mom and my grandma everyday. Especially now.  It’s hard to feel like your connected when you’re literally told to distance yourself.  Good luck!

GriefSupport,fljv6ge,t3_fp78i2,1585227448.0,My mom died at 65 last year. I had a lot of trouble sleeping. But it got better within about 4 months. It does get easier but there’s still a lot of pain there. Sending you good vibes. I’m really sorry for this major loss.
OCPoetry,fld66wv,t3_fntz3j,1585057552.0,"I agree with the last comment to break it up a bit. But not too much because those long paragraphs are pretty stagnant. But the stagnation of her at the window matches.  I would say break up the lines in a way could create tension. Laborious breathing. Awkward pauses? I’d try some of those. 

Good luck!"

Today I was sitting with my girlfriend on the steps on the Lincoln memorial and I just started crying because so many things are just so different than I thought they would be.
