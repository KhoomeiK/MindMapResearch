A beautiful term from a mental health podcast called the mental health hour. 

And that’s a perfect situation for it. 

An awful feeling that your hand is bothering you, but also awesome that your allowing your beautiful brain to work."
bipolar,fef6i2o,t1_feewxzi,1579049333.0,I feel exactly that way. I love how you put it; privately proud.
bipolar,feelqtz,t1_feea5x9,1579036317.0,"I feel you. I’m just not ready. I debate with this regularly. On one hand, I’m proud to say I am bipolar and look what can be accomplished and break the stigma. Example: someone at lunch (work) today said their daughters friend got diagnosed with bipolar. The whole table did a collective ‘oooh’. And I sat there. Paralyzed. Didn’t say a word. 

The other hand: it’s no ones fucking business. They also don’t know I’m a sexual assault surviver and a product of two addict parents, in therapy since 2nd grade and have a brother who killed himself. 

So I am a closed off person generally so I feel like disclosing I’m bipolar isn’t fitting for me."

It’ll be her front leg, I feel that seems to be the most common I’ve been seeing. There is a dog at the shelter missing his back right leg and you wouldn’t even know. Still jumps and does circles when he’s happy ☺️"
dogs,fdncp2r,t1_fd5fml9,1578582965.0,I’m happy to hear your dog was able to survive the cancer; and now has a little extra character! I’m slightly nervous because we have all hardwood floors so that might aid in a few extra nose dives but I’m sure she’ll be able to adapt! Thank you for your insight.
dogs,fdncijk,t1_fd56in0,1578582849.0,Awesome thank you for your advice! We meet with the specialist to see exactly what to expect.

childfree,fb9k5pb,t1_fb95ztb,1576640766.0,"Thank you guys! I appreciate the time you took to explain it because I’ve been confused. Since the bisalp is slightly longer and seemingly more invasive, how long would you say recovery is? Work can be difficult to get time off but it’ll be worth it for me.

Again, thank you dearsignature for clearing it up for me!"
childfree,fb8hgd9,t1_fb8095n,1576614042.0,"Curious, what was the deciding factor for the bilateral salpingectomy VS tubal ligation? I saw your procedure was complete removal of the tubes vs burning or tying them. 

My husband is sterile but it isn’t comforting enough for me. The few people who knew about his procedure, all knew someone who knew someone, had still gotten pregnant 😑. People are the worst.  

He tested sterile and we waited a while before having unprotected sex but I’m still nervous about it. 

I recently switched to a new gyno for other issues. But I’ll be bringing it up to her. My old gyno was old fashioned and he shut the idea down immediately about me getting sterile. ‘Whose gonna help me put my kids through school if you don’t have any kids! I need my income!’ *insert annoying fucking laugh."
childfree,fb7vw24,t3_ebxjoq,1576600563.0,"That’s awesome! ☺️

I’m going to assume that you’re female (based on your name), correct me if I’m wrong. But if so, I have some questions regarding the procedure and any push back from your doctor about setting you up with a surgeon to have it done."
childfree,f9tq0nr,t1_f9tkyyu,1575636095.0,"That’s so assuring! I used to hear all the time, it’s so painful. It’s so invasive for the woman. ‘Are you sure? How about we wait til your older’ like nah bitch I’m 29, been with my husband for 12 years, married for two. 

I think I’ll speak to my gyno about it too. I know my husband is sterile but still. Also people love telling me horror stories about how they know a guy whose got it done and still got someone pregnant. Most people don’t listen to the dr and don’t wait the allotted time before having unprotected sex. I waited 7 months and two different test samples before I felt comfortable enough to get off the birth control. 

It makes me feel better too knowing it doesn’t seem I’ll have to take off any time at work. Maybe a day just because 😉"
childfree,f9t39vn,t3_e6ocj4,1575607435.0,"Questions about your surgery! First off, good for you! My husband got snipped which was a huge help because my gyno wouldn’t approve me to have my tubes tied. I believe there is some sort of criteria to have it done. But anywho, although my husband has been cleared as sterile, I’m still anxious about it. I would feel better if I had a procedure too. How long was recovery? And if you don’t mind me asking, any criteria or insurance restrictions? Do they do a test to make sure your sterile? 

My biggest fear is that even with him being snipped, it could still happen. And then I’d be force to rid of the baby and risk my marriage 🤷🏻‍♀️"

bipolar,f957bhi,t3_e3w6qd,1575120985.0,"I believe it’s worth mentioning. A rule of thumb for me personally, if I question ‘should I bring it up?’ I bring it up. 

I’ve learned excessive or unnecessary money spending is a sign for me because I’m also cautious of spending money, big or small."
BipolarReddit,f90bh6d,t3_e31uj8,1574970141.0,"Ugh. What a fucking nuisance. Sorry everyone seems to think their privileged enough to invade your personal details about your mental health. 

None of their business but also seems unmerited since you don’t seem to be acting out. 

Hope you can enjoy good food and may the company get better!"
MormonandtheMethhead,f8w6chu,t1_f8tu19h,1574884188.0,Absolutely. It’s wildly entertaining and funny. Helped me look deeper into my views and thought processes. Concepts I never considered and fun topics to explore. You’ll enjoy!

MormonandtheMethhead,f82hn8z,t1_f82cfya,1574191416.0,"I probably shouldn’t of weighed in on an episode I haven’t heard. So everyone’s definition of ‘bashing’ is different I’m sure. I don’t think criticizing is bashing. Having a discussion, which I’m sure is what it was, is perfectly acceptable for your own podcast. 

Bashing, I picture someone completely demolishing someone’s name and discrediting all their great work because of one bad piece of work. So I apologize for assuming you were actually bashing someone, when in fact, I didn’t hear the episode yet. 

But with that being said, if you lose listeners over it, they aren’t meant to be your audience anymore. 

I thoroughly enjoy the podcast and maybe if I’m feeling daring, because I feel like I never correctly articulate what I’m trying to say, I’ll start some conversations on here. Even if I am just talking to myself."

Give it time. Typical answer I know. When you’re somewhat comfortable with the situation, start to normalize it. It won’t feel like such an invader. Hope this helps!"

And I def just had to google SJW mentality. I agree. If I don’t like something, keep it moving and don’t inadvertently plug their material. Because now I’m gonna check it out and most likely laugh my ass off."

MormonandtheMethhead,f80s2ld,t1_f80qng2,1574136749.0,"Right? 
I was happy to think since I’m ALMOST caught up, I could start to read up on their subreddit. 

I was avoiding it because I didn’t want it to give anything away. Hopefully it picks back up?"
