Target,foyr6mw,t1_foyr4pt,1588177666.0,and they’re also at higher risk but they are the ones who come up close lol

Target,fnlatks,t1_fnla1ts,1587050245.0,wow fortunate to have a garage haha. sounds like an awesome setup
Target,fnetopw,t1_fnetatp,1586895667.0,lol I called my store HR TL and she took care of it!
Christianity,fmxa45a,t3_fxuhtn,1586461225.0,Shortness of breath than be caused by just about anything. A lot of times it can be anxiety related or muscular. I pray everything goes well
Target,fmfsb6r,t1_fmfs7so,1586033808.0,I am aware. I plan on taking a leave soon. This was my first time calling out in 9 months.
Target,fmf9s79,t3_fuw9a1,1586022792.0,Update: called out.. thanks for the answers!
Target,fmf0sfl,t1_fmf0po6,1586017630.0,Yeah thanks for this. Hopefully you don’t work at my store lol
Anxiety,fmdqeko,t1_fmdq5p2,1585974793.0,"Not sure if you’re religious but the only thing keeping me calm rn is knowing that no matter what happens, God has never failed me yet. And he has made a way when there was no way!"
Anxiety,fmdq7lu,t3_fulpb0,1585974632.0,It’s scary. I’m scared. But just be thankful you aren’t in NY (im guessing). Anxiety attacks won’t kill you. It’s all temporary. I had one while driving on the highway and I was scared to death but I was fine in 5 minutes. Don’t worry!
Anxiety,fmdpxx2,t3_fuco2s,1585974409.0,Try changing positions to see if it opens up those tense muscles to let some air in! That’s helps with me
Anxiety,fmdoioy,t3_fufb84,1585973246.0,"I went through this exactly. I was laying down and got up with a feeling of doom and ran to my mom to drive me to the ER. I was sure I was dying but they ran all the tests and I was healthy. They didn’t even tell me it was a panic attack. They had no answer. 

I realized anxiety can cause a lot of tightness in your body than can cause pain in your chest. Also, elevated blood pressure causes things like pain in the arm. If the docs say you’re fine, you’re fine."
Anxiety,fma05nc,t3_ftz8oj,1585880591.0,I don’t do weed but I do CBD which is somewhat similar without the THC. Just a suggestion
Target,flosgro,t1_flonzg2,1585344555.0,Agreed. Three Tiers are perfect for this
Target,fl78vyg,t1_fl78r7t,1584896767.0,Lol it’s a gif cause I wanted it to repeat

Target,fky50pt,t1_fky4xja,1584641542.0,Soldiers get benefits and special treatment. Soldiers also have more than we are getting. Never would I be a soldier for Brian Cornell
Target,fky4vlc,t1_fky4qpv,1584641460.0,"Actually, you’re right"
Target,fky4u30,t1_fky4q9n,1584641436.0,That’s the thing. I do have some shortness of breath but I also have anxiety so I get it from that
Target,fky4rjb,t1_fky4owm,1584641397.0,I used to like Target until this mess started and all I got from target was “work more hours! We need to make money”
Target,fkmmbsm,t1_fkmm6oh,1584332773.0,I agree. Ours was 11% tonight
Target,fkmm9mb,t1_fkmm6zz,1584332724.0,😂😂I felt this one
Target,fkmls4l,t1_fkmlpx4,1584332336.0,lol you must have a store that hasn’t been audited in decades
Target,fkmlkwq,t1_fkmliq6,1584332178.0,How is that even possible lol
Target,fkmkaj6,t1_fkmk8vo,1584331190.0,😂 it took forever to get it off tik tok and edit so thanks
Target,fj4vufe,t1_fj4vqax,1583018111.0,Haha you’re right about this. Love the guests tho that bring a truck or minivan!

Christianity,fiw3n7u,t1_fiw3ke0,1582774380.0,Referring to the grave soaking and the belief that people can bring loved ones back from the dead
Christianity,fivxmex,t1_fivxfnh,1582770356.0,"Haha I got mad respect for you cause you’ve endured the worst.

And yes, that is exactly true. I grew up in a church with mostly hymns. And they never spoke to me as much as the contemporary worship songs."
Christianity,fivwmt6,t1_fivw9wn,1582769720.0,I definitely know their teachings are wrong. But for me the songs have spoken to me to show that Jesus is real. And that the story is real. And that he can be my friend.
skiing,fip6wih,t3_f8v8gh,1582599354.0,"Even though the skiing community in general is more Caucasian, it has been very nice and supporting of me when I go to resorts. Never felt out of place!

Edit: this brought a smile to my face"
Target,fhpncp3,t1_fhpktaw,1581792648.0,"Thanks for this. I think a lot of people, as you said, feel like they’re being a bother to society. But since we are all paying towards it, it’s very very minimal"
Target,fhpbdca,t1_fhpbb42,1581785719.0,It wasn’t there last night 😊
Target,fhp745d,t1_fhp71mh,1581783492.0,Thank you. Should have been included in the post tho

Target,fhnsd7z,t1_fhnsass,1581731879.0,Wow I don’t see why that wouldn’t qualify 😕
Target,fhnqsg5,t1_fhnqaro,1581731101.0,Hopefully they increase again after trump gets out and they cut his plan
Target,fhnj6ht,t3_f3v8rm,1581727453.0,"There’s no sources to credit this, and they usually only net probably 10%-20%. But mostly there’s no credit to this. Also anyone who’s going hungry could apply for food stamps"
Target,fhmci0a,t1_fhmcfql,1581710994.0,😂😂😂 right? And they’re like “what’s wrong?”
Target,fhlqpkk,t3_f3rlnh,1581703543.0,I love how I can scan multiple items at once at Target when I checkout. Rather than it being like “please place the item in the bag!”
Target,fhb8nsb,t1_fhb7hxm,1581437140.0,Haha ok
Target,fh9ptvi,t1_fh9p2l8,1581386890.0,"I’m honestly not sure about that. This is a separate app, as I’m sure you know"

Target,fh6ywdb,t1_fh6yoda,1581309711.0,Lolllll this might be for Karma
Target,fh51laa,t1_fh4y87d,1581284145.0,Ofc! I actually have no previous discipline and I’ve only been late once. I’ve been with target for over 1.5 years
Target,fh4r17a,t1_fh4qyru,1581281311.0,Remember me when I’m gone
Target,fgp5foq,t1_fgol64c,1580997315.0,Fortunately I get everything done hours early so it’s not like I’m underperforming
Target,fgkhmdb,t3_eyx64b,1580865764.0,That’s me. And one day my team lead saw me doing it and she went over the walkie and said “hey (name) you gonna stop and talk to every team member on the sales floor or are you gonna do some reshop”😂
Target,fghh3k7,t1_fghe76e,1580784677.0,😂😂 the ones who used to be hard and bossy are now chill
Target,fgetr27,t1_fgetlmp,1580709688.0,Can confirm. I go into Walmart’s to poop tho
Target,fgesnfh,t1_fgesluz,1580708582.0,Wow didn’t know they had bathrooms in TMSC
Target,fges9eq,t1_fges7kn,1580708202.0,Agreed. Some stores are truly awful. But fortunately my SD is probably the best. Always making jokes with us and looks out for our health
Target,fges2lv,t1_fges1me,1580708021.0,"My bad, I’m stupid"
Target,fges0hr,t1_fgerup3,1580707966.0,This was actually a joke. My team leads are very supportive and they support me whenever I have to leave early and they encourage me to take 15’s when I’m having a difficult time. Thanks tho for looking out! I appreciate all the target help(:
Target,fgerxko,t1_fgervr1,1580707890.0,Haha I don’t work at your store. But then again I see a new face everyday so I wouldn’t be surprised
Target,fgervvw,t1_fgelcwt,1580707845.0,"If you’re doing a deep zone then it should probably take that amount of time. Maybe a little less. But for regular zones, bring everything on the shelf that looks like it might belong there and pull it forward. Cover the diamonds. And make sure that when a team lead walks by the aisle, they see everything pulled forwards. This will probably take about 2-3 hours if toys is somewhat decent."
Target,fgeridx,t3_ey1ceh,1580707492.0,"If anything I’d block out your picture rather than your name 

Edit: because people might not know your name but they’ll know your face"
Target,fgedfa6,t3_exyy77,1580697007.0,I have bad anxiety announcing my breaks and when I’m leaving..... so I don’t. I just tell a team lead I’m taking my 30. I don’t tell anyone about 15’s because they aren’t significant. And at this point they know I finish everything so no one cares. But I do have to think of what I’m going to say before speaking into the walkie
Target,fgeb0f1,t1_fgeayk4,1580695454.0,I can say the same honestly. Glad you have people who care
Target,fge5e7t,t1_fge5bbx,1580691746.0,That’s truly awful. Usually they tell me to take a 15 minute break if I need it
Target,fgd6y2o,t1_fgd6qso,1580679574.0,😂😂yeah and I’m like “I’m in here”

Target,ffc8zm7,t1_ffc7lkw,1579794277.0,Honestly not sure 😂
Target,ffavk67,t3_esf0pg,1579745489.0,"Basketball shoes are simply not made for running or walking like you do at work. I’d recommend running shoes. I currently wear Nike Joyrides. I wouldn’t recommend them since they’re $130, but you get the point. I had a $50 pair before these and it worked just as fine, if not better!"

skiing,fe6lzjy,t1_fe6lxp8,1578895417.0,Right? I’m curious how they plan to reopen on Friday. They won’t be able to make snow until Thursday night. They can’t lay a foot of snow over night haha

Target,fdlcsj1,t3_elzovk,1578521264.0,No it feels nice. But we had a seasonal become a DBO after about a week. Generally DBO’s are just former Hardlines people. Same pay. Just a fancy name
Target,fdlav85,t3_elxz2a,1578520111.0,Ha either she tried to fool someone and took the display or the cashier was blind. People always ask about the displays and I’m like “yeah I can sell it to you for 1 cent
