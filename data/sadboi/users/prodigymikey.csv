We’ll have some more teats for the upcoming holidays too, but our [custom decorated sugar cookies](https://www.etsy.com/listing/786055114/custom-decorated-sugar-cookies?ref=shop_home_active_3&crt=1), cakes, and the recently added [Texas Two-step Fudge](https://www.etsy.com/listing/792423816/texas-two-step-fudge?ref=shop_home_active_10) are becoming increasingly popular. Stay safe and healthy guys!"
AskReddit,fqmhekb,t3_gjgn93,1589477487.0,"So, I was hanging out with a friend who had asthma, having only ever smoked weed a few times, and so he says “hey try this, it’s like weed but it doesn’t hurt your lungs when you smoke it”. So I said that’s cool, what’s it called, and he said “it’s called ICE”. Soooo yeah, accidentally tried Meth, didn’t know it was meth because of the name and I’d never seen it smoked. 
Luckily I was hooked after that, but only for 2 years (it’s been 10 years since I’ve done any hard drugs at all).
Moral of the story? Knowledge is power, kids knowing the names of drugs (and the slangs), and actually seeing them in their different forms so they know what to look out for, could save your life."
