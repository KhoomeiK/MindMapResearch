Bunnies aren't that fragile. I know it's easy to believe, but I had some really though little guys that weren't scared of anything. They all have different personalities.

They have a bunch of sicknesses they can get, but that's usually due to age or something like cancer, you cannot avoid it.

Introverted simply means you draw your energy from being alone, not that you're uncomfortable around people.

There's a select group of people I feel comfortable with. 3, to be exact. Us four in a group is totally fine, and were a group of introverts, too. All with similar interests, and a high level of acceptance to all the weird stuff someone might say/do or get into.

They're close friends of mine. I feel less socially anxious around them. I still feel tired but content after our hangouts.

My boyfriend I also love being around with. BUT he's the only one that actually charges 'my battery' while being around. We don't talk, were just present for each other, we just hold hands and kiss. It's perfect for me, and we understand each other without words.
