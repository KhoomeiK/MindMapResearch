adultsurvivors,fh9k17f,t1_fh9b0kb,1581383122.0,"Oh I feel you on the jealous of kids thing, I have nextdoor neighbours with 2 young girls (they’re the same age as I when I began being abused) and in the summer they’re always out playing and riding their bikes (their parents supervise them)  (like most normal kids do when it’s the summer time) I walk by to my car sometimes and I find it hard not to think about how I didn’t have that. How when I was their age I was inside crying myself to sleep after I came home from school because I didn’t know what I was feeling was depression. How they had parents who were actually paying attention and looking after them.
Then in my head I’m like “I’m jealous of these little kids?! I’m so fucked”"
adultsurvivors,fh9d3bm,t3_f1yg0q,1581378481.0,"Yes, I find myself feeling like that more than I can count, then I end up hating myself for feeling that, but I have every right too. Nobody understands. 
It’s basic things too, like getting affection from one of your parents, or having friends you can count on when you’re having a bad day, I never had any of that."

adultsurvivors,f4fukoh,t1_f49t081,1571574643.0,"There’s a big difference between a homeless guy who needs something to eat, and a degenerate pedo or a child molestor, one of them deserves to live and the other doesn’t, any normal person with good morals can understand that difference lol"
adultsurvivors,f4fucf4,t1_f497jlb,1571574551.0,that would be perfect
adultsurvivors,f4ftvhg,t3_djyrn5,1571574438.0,"What’s weird is I’ve never seen people advocate for it in real life, and I hope I never do, I would probably lose my mind. I’ve only seen people do it online, they’re all degenerates and the lowest people in society (the people who advocate for “rehabilitation”. Sex offenders deserve nothing except what they deserve :)"
Vampireweekend,f3aljpq,t3_dg6nu5,1570778874.0,"I’d prob cry too, they came down where I live but it wasn’t a regular arena (and it was pretty far from where I live) and I have nobody who would go, I’d give my leg to hear them play Hannah hunt live 😭😭"
Anxiety,f2owkon,t3_dduir3,1570334345.0,I legit felt at ease reading this 😆
adultsurvivors,f1ikxsh,t3_d9i9x7,1569511728.0,"Can’t relate to how you feel more tbh, every single word you said. Sending hugs ❤️❤️❤️"
adultsurvivors,f0w5sz1,t3_d6togr,1568999652.0,"I legit dealt with that issue till I was atleast 14, and was still struggling to even comprehend why it was happening, ofc now I know why, but It was a really embarrassing and sad time for me. Also was even worse cuz my mom would lecture me about “wetting the bed at your age” and that obviously didn’t help, I haven’t wet the bed since."
adultsurvivors,epvqqxs,t1_epvnhcs,1559545613.0,"That person who’s trolling you is really demented and creepy, I’ve messaged the mods about them but for some reason I have no response from them, that individual has been harassing random people in this sub for weeks now. Really disgusts me, I reported that comment they said to you as well but Idk if the mod finds anything wrong with that person considering they’re not being banned or anything,👍"
adultsurvivors,ep9qgfq,t1_ep16ppw,1559114438.0,"Im sorry but a quick look through at that individuals profile and comment history tells me they have no “good intentions” lol, I actually took the pleasure in reporting them to the mod on this sub, not sure what will happen, they don’t seem like they’re here to help anyone. Nobody in this sub needs to see comments like that from hateful gross people like that individual. Check their profile, it’s disgusting, who comes to a subreddit for victims of sexual abuse to troll people? Jfc, that’s a whole creepy level of evil."
adultsurvivors,eozdmnk,t1_eozd3pr,1558959460.0,"Lol “control freak” ok lmao, do you really think you’re “helping” anyone here by self -diagnosing people with ambiguous disorders on the Internet? Please look at yourself first."
adultsurvivors,eozd5hw,t1_eoz11uz,1558959293.0,"Checked the post out, I can’t relate more, I really don’t like the person tho in the comments there that said you could have  “multiple personality disorder” seriously, that’s unnecessary to say in regards to your post."
adultsurvivors,eozcslx,t1_eozamna,1558959153.0,"Op has literally described only one “symptom” of what you’re speaking about, unless you’re actually well read in psychology or are a therapist/psychiatrist I don’t think you should be self-diagnosing people like that. Don’t confuse people please."
