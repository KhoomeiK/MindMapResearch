schizophrenia,fn45bos,t3_fz1pdf,1586634363.0,"I've been symptom free a year and a half, and to be honest I had no way of telling I was delusional or hallucinating for a while after realizing I have had schizophrenia for my whole life. I spent the first year making sure I was right about the self diagnosis, self doubting, then another year really confused on what I should do, tried going to doctors. I eventually started to help myself. It was really hard for me trying to think of loops that could help me realize reality. Realizing that I have schizophrenia probably helped this in some way, I became aware that I definitely had symptoms, and once I knew enough to identify what could be hallucinations and delusions here and now...yeah. It became easier to mentality say ""fuck off"" when I worked out something was off. Doubt is going to be there, but my key was to be completely stern about it, that's how I got it all to go away because I never let it stay. There are some that could automatically be dismissed- like, the hallucination was a voice that said one sentence, and it was a British voice...I live in the USA, in my residence most African Americans, so theres no use being bothered by it and looking around for who it came from. Or a thought that the world was a simulation again, when I know trees exist so the world exists, so that shit doesn't add up. Things came and went till nothing came back. idk if this helps anything. For the record, never been on any mental health medication for any of my issues, but I'm not saying it doesn't work for some people. This is my experience, this is what I had to figure out because no doctors I went to would really diagnose me, even then I refused meds till it was absolutely certain there was nothing I could do about it, I wasn't going to give up. It was a bumpy ride."

mentalhealth,ezb96i8,t3_d0onls,1567815853.0,"Err I have a mother like yours. She's mostly been working away from me and my brother, but when she's home she yells about the house and dishes, how dirty it is, or complaining about work or how her feet are aching or how fat she is or her bills. Since she works in a hospital she works night or day shifts, usually after she comes and sleeps and or runs around doing a bunch of stuff while dragging me along in her stress. Her problem is that she can't hold a relationship because she's so self-absorbed in her problems. She's so emotionally neglectful of everyone around her, judging my family and friends to a point where no one wants to be around her. It's given me a judgmental look on the world, which I don't personally like. Her outlook on others, including me, doesn't help with my depression and anxiety.  It makes me feel like my own mother doesn't love me, which I know she does but not enough to change so I changed, and she makes me feel like I'm never good enough- makes me fear that that everyone hates me, too. I've learned to handle these feelings with ignoring what my mother says, and have been doing good so far, I realized that one of my issues was my low self-esteem, fuelling my fear that others hate me too. Being there for myself is the answer, but now that I'm mentioning, I should add that your life isn't my problem- as harsh as that sounds lol. 

Be there for yourself, I believe it's going to be okay no matter what, I'm making the most with what I have and will continue to build on that. I've noticed that I have a new outlook on life, as this has helped with my anxiety a lot! Not so much with my depression though, I'm still healing."

 I try to cope by listening to loud music in my headphones while walking long distances but that doesn't really help it just tunes out the unbearable anxiety thats there. (I'm doing this right now ha) Weed has been helping me get to sleep too, I don't feel numb and tired, I can relax, easily go to sleep and don't have any weird nightmares about my trauma. I have limited supply as I only bum from my brothers untrustworthy enablers because I have a hard time handling a job- but I can't handle that type of toxic relationship as they just use each other to get high, so it's been hard for me to relax when I'm around them when allowing them in my house to smoke. Pure THC is what works for me, CBD gives me headaches.

Sorry that you have to go through this. Since I have been trying to see doctors about my anxiety they are planning to put me on medication once they understand the gravity of my poor mental health (at the moment they've all assumed I have GAD lol, it's been really hard to accept that I have ptsd so I've never truly told anyone feeling safe, it's to hard and I have panic attacks) so there's always trying to talk to your mom anyways like I struggle to too. And it worked, sorta, my mom is a enabler of my lack of self care as she's only worried about herself getting blamed for my trauma, but I'm getting through. Seems like the bad stuff only happens to all of us huh?

But I put to much pressure on myself around other people to talk the first time, so do what feels comfortable for you. I seriously need to be telling my new physiatrist and family doctor this."
