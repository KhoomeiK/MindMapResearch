I also had a male friend who knew how much I hated being around toxic people and I also hated fighting, when I wanted to cut him off because he was hurting me he accused me of being a toxic person who wants to fight

I won’t be surprised if he looks on those apps even with. No one should lie no matter what the reason but the on and off thing is immature on both ends. In my opinion men and women who move on to fast without clearing their head or taking time to take things in aren’t worth your time. These types of people either hurt their rebounds or were always looking for something new not always the case but paired up with a liar? You deserve better

Don’t take this as me wanting to do all sins now and then being a good Muslim later because I have good intentions and don’t want to commit any unnecessary haram actions that are easy to break (My tattoo addiction has been stopped and I don’t care for tattoos as much as I did when I was younger). I just want to fix my “in process” tattoos right now without god being angry at me 😊
islam,fp4b9ln,t1_fp3ze5h,1588295412.0,Yes I know a lot of tattooed Muslim reverts but my story is a bit different because I don’t want to be like other sinning Muslims who get tattoos just because they want it but I want tattoos to fix the mess I have in my body. I don’t want to be walking around with half a tattoo nor a huge weird looking blob that was meant to be a covered up faded tattoo. I don’t know if I’m being clear enough but to repeat again I don’t want to get a clean slate from converting and then get more sins added. If I didn’t have any tattoos then I probably wouldn’t be wanted to get any since they are haram but since I already did that I’d rather them be fixed first :)
islam,fp40k06,t1_fp3yy73,1588289322.0,I do know I will get a clean slate but I don’t want to add sins that were easy to avoid such as tattoos. I know reverts can keep there tattoos but my circumstance is different because I already scheduled appointments to lighten the tattoo and then add on top + another tattoo that was not finished needs to be finished. I don’t want god to be angry that I have followed this past and still do unnecessary haram acts. I really don’t want to keep my tattoos the way they are I want to fix them first but idk if god is understanding or thinks what I’m doing is wrong. I have no plans on getting new tattoos but simply fixing past :) thank you

When I broke no contact suddenly I was the most beautiful woman he knows, compliments we’re flooding in most likely to make me fall for his shit. When I did ask what he loved about me he said “you are so patient” translation “I would ignore ur issues for days and u would keep calm”, “you are nice” translation “after the smear campaign you never once spread anything about me”, “you are a shy and keep to urself” translation “you didn’t post anything about me on social media to make me look bad”.

If they are done than maybe she does want to reach out or she wants this comfort knowing she’s not alone, maybe she thought you guys got back together and she accidentally followed or followed to see if youd post him.

introvert,fgubqqf,t3_f0a2bx,1581116973.0,I never had the high-school experience and now in college I feel like I’m a fruit fly in the cafeteria. I’ll be telling me kids about all the fun memes I saw online instead of experiences I had
depression,fgubn74,t1_fgt0net,1581116908.0,"Omg how did you describe me. Whenever I have something important in my life, I feel like those episodes that try to give the background character some light but none of the audience cares so they just continue being the background character."
SkincareAddiction,fgubin3,t3_f09g6k,1581116825.0,For some reason people that treat their skin awful are blessed. My mom never used anything nor does she now and she’s 50 looking 30. My friend using cheap dollar store body lotion on her face and washes with hand soap. I’m jealous
SkincareAddiction,fgubcyk,t3_f0bqmd,1581116722.0,I don’t take skincare serious on vacations then come back sunburned or dry depending the country ugh
depression,fgt79ht,t3_f0bl3z,1581100486.0,"Yes I just finished by first shift since January 20. And I’m gonna take another week off, I can’t :("
SkincareAddiction,fgkx7ss,t3_eykuz8,1580875771.0,"I have extremely cracked lips, I exfoliated the dead skin off and it isn’t flaky no more, I started drinking more water and applied aquaphor but now their are cracked even when moisturized. It’s like I have permanent lip lines now and they look so sore upclose. I heard petroleum is bad and so are 1000 of chemicals in lip balm so I use Burt’s bees now. Help!"
UnresolvedMysteries,fgjilbq,t1_fgjifuo,1580844799.0,"That makes sense, hopefully there aren’t murderers who gotten away, but the video still scares me to this day."
SkincareAddiction,fgh4hsu,t3_eyakwp,1580776491.0,"You’re skin looks great naturally, maybe look into IPL laser facials or hydra facials instead"
SkincareAddiction,fgdzld1,t3_exw6kw,1580688651.0,"I suffer from rosacea and my skin somewhat looks like that, you might want to check a dermatologist or inform yourself about rosacea symptoms. The IPL laser facial treatment is the best for rosacea, it helps with veins, open pores, wrinkles,redness and a lot of other concerns. It’s usually over a hundred dollars in Toronto where I live but groupon has coupons for different clinics that can range from 40-60 canadian dollars, idk where you are from but check out groupon.com or groupon.ca, if you’re into the facial. Oh and sunscreen 100%"
SkincareAddiction,fgdx87q,t3_extjta,1580687968.0,"It makes me so happy seeing men who are into skincare and proudly show it. It all works out in the end. You should check out The Ordinary, it saved my skin, buy an exfoliating acid (lactic for example) to use at night so ur discolouration diles down. If you want more trust worthy acids or serums, the ordinary got hyaluronic acid aswell and most products are under $15.You’re routine seems great so far!!!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fgcu00k,t1_fgcih35,1580676249.0,"It’s not even with narcs, just call out anyone and most people get defensive, it’s really annoying especially when they’ve hurt you. If someone calls you out, apologize and change ur behaviour, or just leave them alone. They wanna seem like there’s more to them, so then show it, why do u only show ur bad side? Makes no sense!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fgbvmeo,t3_exoksv,1580666557.0,"I recently called mine out he said “you don’t know me, you only know what I chose to show you not how I am” he’s right he had a double life and hide a lot of things but I figured out hes a cheater and a horrible person. He used that phrase in the context of “Im actually a good person I just don’t show it or brag” ya right. But Ik I exposed him and he got really defensive and send paragraphs to multiple of my social media’s and I just blocked and went to bed."
beauty,fgbuxxf,t1_fgbt0rq,1580666352.0,"To add on, I have prominent eye shape so that is the easiest to crease because our eyeball sort of sticks out and there is a hollow area under neath so it folds if that makes sense."
beauty,fgbub3q,t3_exeurn,1580666151.0,After concealer like right away. Apply ur primer if you use it then foundation then concealer and bake it
beauty,fgbtgf0,t3_exnh8p,1580666001.0,"I’ve heard physical exfoliants aren’t good and a lot of women who are superrr into skincare are telling to stay away. You can go to the ordinary it’s really cheap around $7-$15 and buy lactic acid or mandelic acid. It’s a serum that exfoliates your skin, I have rosacea and I’m sensitive yet get thick build up, and it helped me a lot :)"
beauty,fgbt0rq,t1_fgbkjuq,1580665866.0,"I think it may be you because I too have the same problem. I’ve tried high end to low end, light, heavy, Ive even followed YouTube tutorials how to prevent creasing and it still does, I’m so annoyed because nars is my favourite concealer"
NarcissisticAbuse,fgbr4nx,t3_exocjl,1580665265.0,To add on she broke his finger and I don’t mean simply broke it but BROKE IT the whole tip was missing and it still makes me sick thinking about that picture
NarcissisticAbuse,fg9inds,t3_exd168,1580639204.0,"I was always an introvert but enjoyed when people would notice me sometimes because I feel like no human contact will eventually be bad for me but after my nex I could care less, I don’t want to date, don’t care to make friends, don’t care to go on hookups,don’t care for compliments nor attention 
I think it’s good but can be dangerous in the long run to have this energy, but I’m still fresh with my narc ex"
NarcissisticAbuse,ffw64sg,t1_ffth6i3,1580286103.0,"Good luck to you, I hope you truly find someone who treats you right and that man you met is genuine"
NarcissisticAbuse,ffw63dv,t1_fft67dr,1580286051.0,"Yes I push people away and the thing with lovebombing it’s a narcs tactic but also someone who genuinely likes you and is crazy for you might show it at the beginning, my friends boyfriend spoiled her with gifts and love in the beginning and 2 years in he’s still the same and they’re very happy and healthy. I’m scared I’ll mistake someone’s genuine love for a narc tactic"
