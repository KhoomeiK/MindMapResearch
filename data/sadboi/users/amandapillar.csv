I know he can be breathy at times, but I don’t mind it. And then for NCT I actually don’t have a favorite vocalist because they’re all really freaking good.

I’m kind of getting to a point where I’m starting to want to distance myself from friends who have these negative opinions, because for them, it’s not just disliking the music, it’s the exact type of xenophobia that the author brought up. They dislike BTS because they’re “manufactured”, or “they don’t speak English” and there’s a myriad of other reasons that are unrelated to their music. 

As an Asian adoptee, I always grew up in typical American culture, but as an adult, I’m starting to explore more of my cultural roots and identity, and it makes the people I’ve always associated with straight up uncomfortable. On one hand, it sucks because it’s solidifying the fact that these people always saw me as something “other”. At the same time, I’ve found new friends who understand me and have an open minded approach, and have accepted me as I am without expecting me to mold into their acceptable standards.

My guy friend, even after clearly telling him I wasn’t interested, still tried something down the line and now I don’t feel comfortable being around him alone."

kpop,fdc216i,t1_fdapgu6,1578265547.0,He’s so goddamn diplomatic. And didn’t Jin also say something not too long ago? I’m glad they’re looking out for the underdogs; they remember what it was like to be in that position.

AskWomen,fcwtajo,t1_fcoi2cx,1578036726.0,"You literally just described my latest dilemma. I was interested in introducing a new friend of mine to my old friend group, and I was worried about two of them for literally two of the reasons you listed (one is moody/can’t deal if things aren’t going her way and the other is a guy who hits on everyone who breathes). Surely enough, my new friend saw firsthand the very things I feared would happen with the one friend (the moody one got into one of her moods and brought the whole group down with her crankiness). Second friend wasn’t bad. But it just puts into perspective that I shouldn’t have to warn someone about someone I consider a friend. My friend’s moodiness is a lot for me to even handle, so having to subject another person to it is unfair them. This was really insightful, so thanks for sharing. This past holiday is definitely making me reconsider a lot."
bangtan,fcwhxqb,t1_fct2vjk,1578026086.0,"My sentiments basically echo yours. I don’t think the boys will ever turn cold or distant on purpose, but there’s also some things that snap me to the reality of “they really aren’t like us at all”. Like you mentioned, it’s like watching a movie and we just can’t comprehend or relate to the things they’re doing/achieving. And then sometimes there’s other moments that make me feel that way. Something that recently made this feeling come up again was the thing with Joon and his AirPods; the man lost thirty something pairs. And to some, sure it seemed like a quirky Namjoon thing, but for me, I was thinking of the fact that he’s rich enough to be able to treat such an expensive thing as almost disposable. It just came off as being out of touch with the reality that for a lot of their fans, AirPods can be quite a big expense and definitely a splurge purchase that shouldn’t be treated lightly. I’m not saying rich people can’t be relatable, but again it just kind of reinforced that they’re just so above and beyond and I just can’t relate to being this larger than life force in the world."
