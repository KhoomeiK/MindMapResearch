AskReddit,ffj2bpo,t1_ffivngr,1579988620.0,"Where and when was this fire? Do you mean a Back Burn, which is a is a Fire fighting technique to slow or reduce the impact of a Wildfire. Or do you mean a Prescribed Burn/ Hazard Reduction which is typically done in Winter/Spring to reduce available fuel before a fire occurs?

Speaking as a long time Firey, many back burns recently had no chance of stopping these monster fires. But they did work by reducing the intensity by burning off ground fuels ahead of main fire front.

We still lost houses, but we would have lost a hell of a lot more without back burning. 

I'm very happy to recently see 4 houses I thought were gone on New Years Day, still safe after we burnt around them. 8 lives and 20 houses were lost in just one area, on one day while my crew and I were in survival mode just trying to save people and ourselves. The National toll now stands at 33 dead. 

One of the worse things in all this were property owners starting their own burns to save their properties. These people dragged fire fighters away from planning and working on main fire fronts, these wankers caused fire fronts to expand outside of control lines and threaten and destroy other properties. 

There are a couple of incidents of this happening, particularly on the South Coast fires around the Currowan and Bega fires and other places where RFS were strung out keeping up without these idiots doing their own thing.

Arrests have been made, hopefully they go to jail. If I got their hands on them it wouldn't be pretty."

We are talking about very advanced decomposition. The skeleton and any remaining clothes that haven't rotted away would be the most apparent that they were human remains.

Why was it initially suspected as foul play? Initial information to Police has them reviewing a long term decomposed person. This person was placed/covered post mortem. Their first assumptions would simply add up as a death and somebody knew about it.

askfuneraldirectors,f48gws8,t3_djeo7c,1571439002.0,"Some thoughts...

Depending on how well sealed or wrapped, weather, contact with surrounding environment, persons size at death... There is no doubt the remains would be in a very advanced stage of decomposition. Dental records, DNA, other evidence located on site would most likely have been required for identification as common recognition would not be possible.

In respect to identifying an injection site or puncture wound, this would be very unlikely. The ""likely by IV route"" could be a hypothesis based on toxicology analysis of samples taken from the remains that may have suggested concentration, where the drugs were present in the samples identified and how they were being processed by the body. For more information look up PMR, Post Mortem Redistribution of drugs.

The examiners/pathologists would have been looking for cause of death. Not noting THC could be simply that THC was not likely to have been a factor in the cause of death. It may be that at the time it just wasn't present in any significant quantity.

A hot shot or speedball is usually an amphetamine and an opioid mixed together. Most commonly Heroin and Cocaine. However there are a lot of synthetic and natural drug cocktails, the post mentions the drugs found and these unfortunately are becoming not uncommon in a number of overdoses. 

Many of these cocktails are taken intentionally for the highs provided rather than as a device to committ suicide or murder somebody. In any case these drug cocktails have been the cause of a lot of tragic deaths, short of a video, particular evidence found, or a wittness coming forward it would be hard to say if the person did it themselves or if somebody else injected them. Other information would be needed.

In respect to a date of death, most likely a date range has been noted rather than a specific date or time. This would be based on the last know contact or communication with the person when alive, when the deceased was found, state of condition/decomposition, etc. Chances are the date range is at best within a couple of days or even a week or more.

In respect to tabling manner of death, there is Suicide, Homicide, Accidental or Misadventure and Natural. In respect to a determinatiin of accident, other evidence such as drug paraphernalia, pathology/toxicology, known history/timeline and wittness statements as identified would all be considerations.

Any loss is tragic, I hope the family and friends can find the answers and peace of mind they need. My condolences."

Each body being cremated has an ID tag with barcode attached to the coffin. As the coffin goes in to retort it's ID is scanned in. One at a time, from entry to ashes removal it's monitored.

The process, temps, name of person etc are displayed on a screen on the outside wall of the cremator. 

The same ID with barcode and deceaseds name is printed on a sticker or similar which goes on the ashes container when the ashes are recovered.

It's almost impossible to do a secret or extra cremation due to modern equipment process monitoring. All cremations are closely monitored now.

We have a low cost coffin for $895Aus (about $600US) that is MDF with a paper veneer coating with a timber grain look, usually with four nice chromed handles. (We refuse to use cardboard as it's weak and the chemicals used to make the cardboard are very unfriendly to the environment and they're actually more expensive than other coffins made of composite materials).

Dressed up the coffin looks very good and we have our own very nice Chapel that seats up to 50 for family to attend in privacy.

Included is transport into our care, dress and preparation, (no embalming), hearse to crematorium, our service fee, staff, all paperwork and registration, Doctors fees, half hour in the Chapel for view, (most views last 15min tops, viewing in Australia is actually rare), Cremation fee, Death Certificate and certified copies with family able to collect ashes from the crematorium.

All up $4,200Aus ($2,800US) or more common, $3,800Aus ($2,570US) with out a view and preparation. If you want extra, then we can price it for you prior to you having to commit to anything.

Some Funeral Directors do it cheaper, but family might have no view allowed, family have to do the death registration paperwork, pay the Doctors fees, no hearse to crematorium, if you want the person dressed in something particular than the family have to do it. 

These cheaper appearing Funeral Directors can end up being more expensive, stressful and time consuming to families if they want something extra for a farewell. Beware of the cheap appearance of non-profit, church or charity run Funeral groups, do your homework.

It's OK to ask about pricing and services, we know money raising can be difficult and we at least offer zero interest payment plans.

Where I work we will custom any funeral you would like, at home, parks, beaches, themed etc. But, low cost, no service, cremation is around 80% of our business these days."
AskReddit,f2fsx6j,t3_dd5hk6,1570222231.0,"Came home early to surprise her, found her in bed with my friend. She lied and continued to lie about it, even though I caught her in flagrante delicto. Still don't know how she thought she could just ignore it as if it didn't happen??

I learnt she was sleeping for money with 2 others as well. She was extorting them, apparently she got thrills by screwing with people physically and then messing with their minds by threatening to tell their family and workplaces what was happening.

When sorting out the separation I went clearing and collecting my things from a storage room. I found she had pawned my very nice Minolta Camera and lenses. Also gone were several signed albums, including Jim Morrison and Robby Krieger signed The Doors, Roger Waters signed The Wall and a fully signed Platters album from 1962.

Then... Before I have a chance to ask WTF? She does a quick vanishing trick, but not before she and her Mother rack up a shitload of retail credit in my mother's and my name having stolen our identification.

We'd been together 8 years. 20 years later she pops up on my radar. This comes about from a former partner from who tracks me down to see if I know where she is? Apparently tried extorting this poor gal for over $50k threatening to out her as lesbian by sharing images she taken secretly of them having sex."
death,f26mt4z,t3_dc0rbl,1570017114.0,"Experience to date has not been favourable. In Australia, as a Funeral Director, the several I've seen pop up could be summarised as costing thousands of dollars and providing little in actual help.

There are practical things like Wills, Enduring Guardian, Banking etc that people and their families could use help with at the end of a person's life.

There is a place for strong support for folk in their final life staged, however, these death doula folk that have appeared on the radar so far are basically spouting pretty sounds and otherwise sponging off the nearly deceased. 

I know of a group of three doulas who are also very out of date and provide very poor information in respect to how things work when looking at the legalities of death.

The families I've cared for funerals who have used a doula have all said it was a bad idea and wouldn't use one again."

A purging deceased can be vile. Especially if there has been an abdominal bleed. I hate the smell of partially digested blood, hematemesis. Referred to as coffee grounds because of the look."

I've seen Xrays where small rounds that have entered in the neck or head and ended up in completely different parts of the body due to ricochet or the spin of the round.

The most amazing was a .38 that entered the right side of the head across the skull, ricocheted, travelled down the neck onto the chest cavity and ended up on the left side of the heart. A fine copper trace from the bullet coating showed up on the Xray showing it path."

Afters years of responding to motor vehicle accidents I've come to the conclusion that hoons, male and female, young and old;

- Think their driving skills a better than they really are.

- Do not get the concept that any idiot can press an accelerator and go fast, a real driver can drive to the conditions and environment and never have an accident or receive a fine.

- Do not give a shit about themselves or other road users.

- Have no mechanical sympathy."
