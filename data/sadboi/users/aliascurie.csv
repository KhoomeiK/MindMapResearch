BPD,eqww548,t3_bztdt8,1560362263.0,Yupp. It's so distracting at times when you are working and trying to focus but some random thought boils up out of nowhere and shooks your body inside out.
depression,eqd0rjd,t3_bxxohr,1559981702.0,"I feel like all my brain cells were destroyed due to fucking depression.

SuicideWatch,eq9qczv,t1_eq9pfmj,1559915165.0,Then there's something buried deep inside that you aren't dealing with.
SuicideWatch,eq97jbr,t1_eq8ahhb,1559891670.0,I think its not because of that small thing. That small thing is just the push which sets off when you are already over the edge of an emotional cliff.

SuicideWatch,ep6mx4n,t1_ep6lm07,1559071071.0,"I think i would still be saying the same thing if i knew you.
You matter that's why people on this subreddit are trying to help you and talk you out of it.

SuicideWatch,ep6j0gv,t1_ep6ic0x,1559069646.0,"Okay but just try to realize the permanence of your action before you do it.
Don't you think its a little short-sighted to assume that you can't build your self-esteem and things won't change.
Give yourself a chance to fix things, to build your self-esteem."
SuicideWatch,ep6hihe,t1_ep6evg4,1559069084.0,"I understand what's it like to feel like an outcast. What I always think of when I am in a dark place like you are right now is try thinking about people who care about you, how much they will be hurt if you left. I know at one point you gotta think about yourself and your suffering. But if I leave I would just be leaving my family in pain which I cannot bear to do because they have always loved me unconditionally and they deserve better."
SuicideWatch,ep6dnaq,t1_ep6ca1a,1559067694.0,"You gotta stop associating your self - esteem with how everyone sees you. So what if you don't look like the normal or pretty the society has defined, it isn't the end of the world. I know the lonliness is the hardest thing to deal with. I know that but the only way anyone can make it is by start to not give a fuck abt what others think of you.

You can make it and you will once you accept yourself and give a double middle finger to society. Fuck society!

Don't do it kid. I am telling you can make it and you will. Don't leave."
SuicideWatch,ep6bfo4,t1_ep6497a,1559066938.0,"Don't let society win. You gotta stick around to shove it in everyone's face that you made it. Just for yourself, don't do it. You matter!"
SuicideWatch,ep63s0j,t3_bu0jld,1559064270.0,"Don't do it. If you want things to change, you should consider sticking around and help us bring the change. Every single support matters. You matter!
Don't leave."
depression,ep5abkw,t3_btzs76,1559052841.0,"Reaching out to people doesn't change anything.
Its like taking a hit and temporarily feeling better.
Its not as good a relief as you would want it to be.
Having someone to talk to will NOT fix our life."
