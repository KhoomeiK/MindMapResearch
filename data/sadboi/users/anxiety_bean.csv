Thank you so much."
emotionalsupport,eyypbbg,t3_czallk,1567597617.0,"I know this is easier said than done but you two should probably not be friends for a while, give it a year or maybe even two. You need to rediscover yourself without her and if you stay in contact with her there's always the possibility that you might fall back into old habits and start flirting again which would basically reset your progress in rediscovering yourself. Break ups suck but just keep in mind that she chose to leave you for whatever reason so it's better to just let go.

If you ever need someone to talk to I'm here. Goodluck for tomorrow."
