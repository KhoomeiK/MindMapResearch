relationships,fqpncr7,t3_gjpzd4,1589550286.0,"My older sister is the same way. My mom is disabled and practically raises her daughter for her. She sleeps at their house most nights, eats all her meals there, and calls my parents mom and dad. My sister literally bought a house next door to my parents so she could get childcare from them. She also eats all her own meals there and spends most of her time at their house. She throws fits if they say they won't watch the baby for a night or want her to chip in some money for the baby's healthcare or food. Meanwhile, she constantly posts about how she is the best, most dedicated parent on social media. The only time she is alone with her kid, the kid is sleeping. Everytime I go see her, she immediately asks me to watch the baby ""just for a minute."" So I rarely go see her because kids make me incredibly anxious and she knows this. 

Anyhow, I haven't got any advice for you except to say no and come off like the asshole if that is what it takes. The kid is her responsibility, not yours. You aren't free childcare. Just wanted to say that I know a bit of what you're feeling right now and I'm sorry for you. When I was in grad school, I had maybe 20 minutes a day to myself if I was lucky--so I know you're stressed and I can't believe how you have been so gracious thus far. Good luck, and I hope it gets better for you!!"

But there is one memory in particular that I cherish, and that's the night I returned from a 6 week trip abroad. We got engaged a bit before I left, and our date was about two weeks after I was set to return. We had been together for two years at that point, but never been apart for more than two or three days. I flew home and was terribly tired from the jet lag, I also looked and smelled like crap since I had been on a 27 hour trip (lots of layovers and sleeping on airport benches for the cheapest travel option). I was so nervous coming down the escalator to baggage claim because it had been a while and I worried things might be different. But there he was and his smile was so adorable. And the moment we hugged, I knew being anxious was silly, I felt so overjoyed to see him and feel his arms around me. He took me to my favorite restaurant, where everything was too salty since I hadn't had any processed or restaurant food in almost two months. Then, we got some liquor to celebrate my homecoming but I was too tired to drink in the end and fell asleep at like 7 pm. We didn't have sex or anything. The next morning, we cuddled together and giggled, drank coffee, played video games, and generally lived our normal lives. 

I can't stress enough how special it is to me that he was just so happy to see me, to hug and kiss smelly, tired, and frustrated me (the airline lost my luggage leaving Ireland). And even though nothing went the way we pictured on my first night home (awesome dinner date, celebratory drinks, bangin' sex), it was still perfect and beautiful."

AskReddit,fqdh9w1,t1_fqddfao,1589289639.0,"We have combined everything. I run the household finances, but he has access to everything. We have drastically different incomes, his being much higher (more than double mine and much more reliable). We are both from poor backgrounds, but he has a different energy with money (he is a big spender) and I am a saver. We discuss everything that is a purchase not in the budget sheet, as well as how to spend our monthly leisure allotment of funds. Generally, he gets everything he wants (new videogames mostly) immediately because we are both introverted and don't spend a lot of money going out.

Everything is thought of as our money, so it doesn't really trip me up to spend money on a fast food meal (although very often one combo meal is close to my hourly income), but I do feel bad from time to time that I don't bring as much in to help ease our burden. However, I do most of the cooking, cleaning, household management, and carry the emotional load. So it does even out in a way. It's a good balance for us.

Edit: I don't mean to suggest I do more in our relationship. My husband is a wonderful partner, very dedicated and thoughtful. He loves baking and makes us tons of treats and will go out of his way to do nice things for our family and friends. He is always willing to help me with anything I need and doesn't mind at all when I say that the house is dirty and I need help cleaning it, etc. He is just a bit lazy and doesn't take a lead role in these aspects."
AskReddit,fq4hnl2,t1_fq4fvki,1589077880.0,"I have had a few negative experiences telling friends I had issues related to my bipolar disorder. In college, I had a good group of friends in my discipline and we all worked really hard in our field and enjoyed sharing that. We would go to dinners, meet up for tea and research together, and generally enjoy each other's company. But they all stopped talking to me after a breakdown serious enough that I couldn't hide it. I guess they felt it was too much to deal with or were just freaked by it. After that, I became incredibly close with my sister in law. We talked all the time, went on vacations together, hung out Everytime I was in town, etc. When my husband and I moved back to our hometown, I thought we would be closer still. I was wrong though, my episodes were too much for her and she eventually cut contact. My parents are the same way, they don't talk to me about anything serious anymore, and it's incredibly obvious I'm a disappointment and hard to understand. My sister acts like I'm a monster at times. 

Basically, everyone who knows has disengaged with me. And I can't blame them. Sometimes I am a caring and compassionate person, but sometimes I am a reckless monster hurricaning through everything I hold dear. The only person who has stayed is my husband, and I feel a lot that I don't deserve him. Now, I work hard to avoid oversharing, and I tell people I'm ""sick"" if I'm symptomatic. 

I feel like there is no one, other than my husband, that actually cares to have in my life. But I can't blame people who avoid me because I know I'm very near toxic at times. It's just easier to keep people at arm's length so that no one has to be hurt by me unnecessarily."
bipolar,fq1vsov,t1_fq0o6gr,1589050084.0,"I always thought the same. I was doing things like running and social active activities. I hated it, and it seemed to exacerbate shitty feelings. But walks in solitude have always helped me a bit, and yoga (at home in solitude). And now I do a lot of core and short cardio bits and that makes me feel elevated no matter what mood I am in when I start. It took me a long time to find what worked for me though."
AskReddit,fq1lo27,t1_fq0z0xl,1589046749.0,"I'm bipolar as well. For me, this quarantine has been amazing. I am highly educated, but am not usually stable enough to hold down a job that uses my degrees. So I work at a fast food restaurant, it isn't closed right now and I was getting hours. But I couldn't handle the extra stress and paranoia, so I took a leave of absence. Now, I am home all the time with my husband (he is working from home). And things are great! 

Usually, I work against my emptiness or paranoia or massive motivations to do random things halfway before a depression hits. And all I can manage is to simulate being ""normal."" But I have actually had time to work on my mental health now. I exercise a lot, I read a ton, journal and do yoga daily, even on bad days--even if that's all I can manage. I sleep way better, eat healthier foods more reliably (there were days where my husband had to remind me to eat or drink) and we spend way less money erratically.  I'm not saying that there aren't days where I lay in bed most of the day and can't get out of my own mind, but it's way less. And now, I don't have to drag myself out of bed for a 50 hour work week even if I'm struggling, and then come home to try and manage the energy for the coping mechanisms I so desperately need. 

I'm dreading going back to work. This made me look back at the very few periods of stable mental health I have had and realize they were times (mostly after breakdowns) when I wasn't working. 

Sorry to bombard you with all that, but I don't have many confidants (I'm sure you know why/have experienced the woes of bipolar friendship) and I hide my illness from the few I can manage to hold on to. It feels good to get it out there."

So far I have a little swing set area, butterfly garden, personal garden, crafting center, picnic area, beach towels area, little outdoor areas matching all of my villager's homes, and I'm currently working on a beach side fruit stand. 

I don't know how to send pictures appropriately on this sub/not tech savvy so not sure how to get them off my switch, but I can text them to you if you pm me your number."
