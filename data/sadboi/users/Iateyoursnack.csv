AskReddit,eyd25c7,t1_eycjtym,1567010074.0,"""In conventional beekeeping, honey bees are specifically bred to increase productivity. Already endangered, this selective breeding narrows the population gene pool and increases susceptibility to disease and large-scale die-offs. Diseases are also caused by importing different species of bees for use in hives.

These diseases are then spread to the thousands of other pollinators we and other animals rely on, disputing the common myth that honey production is good for our environment.

In addition, hives can be culled post-harvest to keep farmer costs down. Queen bees often have their wings clipped by beekeepers to prevent them leaving the hive to produce a new colony elsewhere, which would decrease productivity and lessen profit.""

Hypothyroidism,eqzrttr,t1_eqyh1bo,1560404992.0,"First, I’m so sorry you’ve struggled with eating disorders and about the accident you were in <3 

I grew up a junk food fiend who always overate but was always tall and slender. It feels weird typing that because I have always hated my body and thought I was too big, even though the numbers would suggest I was always either at the perfect weight for my height or even underweight. 

I went vegan in March of 2017, mainly for ethical reasons, but I was also my highest weight (214lbs at 5’9.5) and was done with my body not acting right. My thyroid had me absolutely miserable.

My hyper thyroid had me craving food constantly, so as a way to teach myself to stop eating the way my thyroid wanted me, I started day on/day off fasting. I don’t think I would really suggest it to most, but for me it helped me get control of an absolutely out of control appetite. 

I’ve been a vegetarian since 2004, so I transitioned into being a vegan pretty easily. I just slowly started taking away those foods and now I really don’t miss much. 

I eat a lot of veggies and lentils!! It may sound boring to some, but I absolutely love what I eat now. Basically every day for lunch, my base of food is a salad. I’m one of those “throw it all in a bowl” vegans. I can either PM you some photos of what I eat or link you to my Instagram where I post some pictures.

I am also pretty sedentary and have been through the last four years. I live in a kinda crappy situation which has meant the apartment I live in is like a prison for me. I did start going out for walks when I started trying to lose weight, but I never noticed a different in the weight loss on weeks I would go for a few walks vs not walking. Of course it’s still good to get out, so I do it now just for the fresh air rather than any weight impact. 

And my take on doctors is that most don’t really know a lot about nutrition. I’ve had very kind doctors say flippant things when it comes to food. It was something I had to look into myself. 

My husband was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis just before I came down with my Graves’ symptoms, so he is a huge reason why eating healthy became a goal for me. I want to do what I can to keep him healthy and we basically eat the same thing as each other. 

Another thing that helped with my mindset on losing weight was never losing sight of my ultimate goal. I had meals where I went overboard, but then it was right back on track. No “Well if I ate this then I may as well eat this”. Nope, right back on track to the goal. 

I’m happy to share some of the concoctions I make! Or answer any questions/clear anything up. I am genuinely happy with what I eat now, which I’m not sure was ever the case before.
