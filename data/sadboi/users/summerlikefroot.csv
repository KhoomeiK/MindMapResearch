honestly I think I’ve been pretty naive about it all- not understanding why it can be a hugely difficult and traumatic experience for some but this is definitely adds a lot of context and makes me think “oh of course people feel the way they do”. 

Hope you’re still well and thanks for responding so quickly!"

NoStupidQuestions,fq3v3xn,t3_g5yxfb,1589070647.0,"Oh yeah for sure.

For me a big part of it is about perfectionism.

Feeling like I should be doing all these things (having a good sleep routine, eating well, spending time on hobbies, to name a few)and to a point following through with them but then getting overwhelmed by how much I’m actually setting myself. so end up crashing back down and doing nothing. Cycle continues.

Might be the same for you or something completely different but that’s my 10 cents. It was a therapist that pointed it out to me, had no real idea beforehand. I just thought I was lazy."

reddeadredemption,fp68orv,t3_gbdf0e,1588348074.0,"Just finished second play through too so this is doubly interesting to read. {spoilers too}  

When Arthur’s says “He’s become more of who he is” about Dutch, I think that’s true. IMO Hosea and Arthur are the ones who have anchored Dutch to his morals and beliefs throughout the whole story, especially Hosea, and when Hosea dies it’s like that’s one of the last tethers is severed. Micah ends up being the fan to the flame that leads Dutch down this path. 

Maybe that’s a bit of a ramble but it’s such a well written story I could read about it for years."

Not sure if this’d actually work but it’s an idea;  I’ve considered having a set time of day to answer text messages and calls, mute everything otherwise, feel like that might take the pressure off of having  to be available 24/7."

Type1Diabetes,fjair5y,t1_fj9xwkg,1583174332.0,"Was thinking about the article again today and I guess “cure” is an easier word to use than the phrase  “possible thing experts believe will help make an illness more manageable”. 

Honestly I’ve never really paid attention to any of the research about it mostly because the nature of the illness occupies too much of my time daily and the idea of a “cure” has never seemed fees-able as I’ve understood it to be. 

Id quite happily take even daily treatments of something over having to constantly check and worry about numbers and insulin and food! 😂"
