offmychest,fp4muxu,t3_gb3s2j,1588302528.0,"I used to be like this, using my depression and anxiety as a crutch. Oh, and my trauma. It took a lot of growing up to realize how pitiful I sounded. One thing I had to learn was to say sorry. Growing up, I was verbally abused and made to say sorry for things I should not have had to be sorry for. For example, my first grade teacher bullied me every day. She made me say sorry for using a pencil to shade in a coloring worksheet instead of a grey colored pencil (very harshly). It would humiliate me to be put down in front of my classmates. Saying sorry made me feel shame and rage. So, when it came to apologizing for things I actually had to say sorry for, I hated it. So I tried to justify my shitty behavior. It gets old real quick. I even got sick of myself doing it, so I knew something had to change. Taking responsibility and owning up to your actions makes you more respectable than trying to justify something that shouldn‚Äôt be. I‚Äôm proud to say what I have been through and am going through makes my empathy stronger. I always try to stay humble and emphatic."

As someone with mental illness, I do lose all sympathy when someone uses their mental illness to justify the bad things they say and do. When they fuck up, it‚Äôs everybody else‚Äôs fault. It could never ever be their fault because ‚Äúyou know there‚Äôs something wrong with me, I can‚Äôt help it‚Äù. I used to be this person, and I‚Äôm growing every day. It‚Äôs easier to catch myself in the act of manipulating someone or laying the blame on someone/something else. People will respect you more if you own up to your actions. Also, this doesn‚Äôt really apply to people who go through psychosis. I understand when someone is truly unwell versus someone trying to hide behind their mental illness so they can keep being shitty. Okay, this was all over the place. Point being, just because you are in a bad way does not mean you can trigger those around you. That behavior pushes people away and I really wish I would have realized it sooner.
