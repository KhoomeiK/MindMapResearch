Hawaii,f6f76lh,t1_f6920pq,1572811223.0,"yes! people often mistake the shaka for being of Hawaiian orgin but it is not actually of Hawaiian origin, however, it may be deemed a part of ""Hawai'i"" culture (note: Hawaiian culture vs Hawai'i culture). I heard the shaka orginated from Hamana Kalili who actually had three three fingers of his fingers cut off in a plantation incident, leaving only his thumb and pinky fingers to wave with; as locals began to imitate the hand sign, the shaka came to be. 

not sure how it got around to surf culture but the shaka itself does not have traditional significance, but rather, a colloquial significance to Hawai'i culture."

what i wish my mum did for me then (and i still wish she would do this with me now, as well) is listen to me. oftentimes, my mum would attempt to immediately extinguish my negative thoughts which never truly worked for me-- what i really wanted her to do was talk me THROUGH it and help me to understand why i was thinking the way i was."
MentalHealthBuddies,ev4ggy9,t3_cetwbo,1564213469.0,"heyo. 
i have pcos as well and, frankly speaking, have never really felt completely comfortable with my body. 
around middle and high school i developed a horrid eating disorder which led me to undergo a year of treatment (but i feel as though, in some way, i am still under recovery, just under different circumstances).

through my time with an eating disorder support group, many of us shared our worries regarding body image and the like, but something which has stood out to me since was a point one of the young women in the groul brought up- this was that there is more to life than the way you look.

one summer, my friends invited me to a beach trip, and i was terribly afraid to wear swimsuit as i felt my body was not worthy, however, when bringing this up to my friend, she insisted that i come along because she wouldnt want me to miss out on the fun experiences i could have with them.

with that in mind, i have carried a similar mindset in realizing that i do not want my fears regarding my body to stop me from, well, living! i am not completely confident in my body, as i have already mentioned, but in thinking about all the things i could do if i just let go of those fears, i bave slowly begun to develop bits and pieces of confidence that help me to live life!

this past summer, i invited a friend to the beach but they refused to go because they feared being looked at differently as they, too, did not feel confident in their body's build. i was sad in that they allowed something such as experience to hold them back from what could have been a thrilling experience!

all in all, this was just my experiences with body issues and how i deal with it at this time. i could most definitely write more but i haven't the time for a thesis (LOL). I wish you the best and hope that you, in spite of the inner battles which you face, can also come to see the beauty that you most definitely wield, as well as the beautiful opportunities which lie beyond that which is within."
MentalHealthBuddies,et8fwfd,t3_caczxk,1562555348.0,"Hey there. I have felt- and continue to feel- the same way, if not, at the very least, similar. I am no therapist, but I would like to share my experience and some means of coping that have helped me to get to where I am today. 

I, too, have felt absolutely alone, even when surrounded by loved ones, and have felt pushed away by those whom I have attempted to make myself vulnerable to. For me, however, my panic attacks went from being manifest when I was alone to breakdowns in front of family when I could not take their ignorance any more. In so speaking, I feel your frustrations. 

Oftentimes, I never knew who to discuss my frustrations with, so I turned to writing. I used the CBT method (Cognitive Behavioral Thinking) in which I stated what I was feeling, in what context I felt it, why I thought I felt it, a rating of how strong my emotions were, and a rational thought to counter it. This, at times, kept my frustrations at bay, and if you have never done something along these lines, I would suggest at least trying it, as it helps you to narrow down exactly where your frustrations, anxieties, and feelings of loneliness are truly radiating from. 

Another coping mechanism I have utilized is exercise. Exercise seems to be a cliche coping mechanism, but when I go for a nice long stroll, I have the time to myself to breathe fresh air and think my thoughts through. It does not always solve my problems, but it allows me to clear my mind and be free from the distractions and stresses that reside within my home.

Music- making music and listening to it- has always been a huge help to me in ushering feelings of relaxation. Sometimes I would have a good Sad Boi session and listen to music that I feel resonates what I am feeling. When I make music, I do so with intention to express my frustrations through the notes I sing and play. 

Not everyone enjoys listening to music or creating it, but I think that if you were to find some way through which you could express your feelings in a peaceful manner, whether it be painting, writing, dancing, etc., you may find some therapy in so doing!

Of course, everyone deals with such differently, these are just a few ways that I have found solace from my anxieties and dark thoughts. 

On another note, reaching out to a larger community, such as those on reddit, can also be a way through which you can connect with more people that will listen and respond to you- such as your post here!

I wish you the best :)"
