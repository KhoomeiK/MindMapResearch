BattlefieldV,fo4dzb1,t3_f8ijwg,1587502709.0,"Sry too late.
I love machine guns in videogames. My definition of it is heavy to lift, slow to move, monstrous amount of bullets in store and difficult recoil. Recoil is sometimes balanced with other traits.

In all the games, very few, countable number of hours were spent by me outside lmg/mmg. 

And i loved the ones in battlefield 3 and 4 the best. As i felt they challenged me. In bf1 i felt lmgs were too easy. M240B is one of my all time favourites. Not sure if it was bf3 or 4.

In bf5, after playing for the first few days, I got really frustrated and i just left. I feel there is much to relearn. I am not sure if it is the right wording, but I feel the mmgs have been made difficult. I feel it restricts my freedom to move around the map and locks me to certain areas. Not sure if this is done in any other classes of guns. But I am no game designer, i hope they had their reasons. 

I have started playing the game again in the past 10/15 days.
While nothing has changed, i am still going ahead with my tenure as mmg lover (read forced, stockholm syndrome) in this game. Starting with mg34. Want to spend enough time on this gun to exhaust myself before moving on to others.

I will happily settle for just an ADS ability in the next game. But they know best. It was probably taken away for a reason. If I get used to it in this game, i will look forward to such restricted guns in the next and the other games. If I never manage to learn this myateriius, elusive gun, i will just play it with frustration, pain and agony."

After months of trying hard to shoot well in this game, and the one before, i finally decided, ""Shooting is not what I want to do"". 
I kept my attempts to get into gunfights very low.

I started venturing from our base to the farthest flag, touching every possible flag on the way, without getting into gunfights and practically avoiding every player on enemy team.

I turned BF4 into a stealth game of my choice. I used to sneak around, watching enemy players spawn, kill my team mates, all while hiding in the bushes. When I come across a flag and my team mates are capturing it, i tried to sneak into the vicinity and capture the flag.

It was extreme fun in some maps, when I have to swim from island to island avoiding boats, avoiding common routes preferred by every human.

I did occasionally run across gun fights where enemies spotted me. I did lose a lot of those fights too. But it was extremely satisfying at times when I actually took down an entire enemy squad who got into gunfight against me.

TLDR:I felt like a smuggler crossing war fronts."
