AskReddit,fbydsi6,t3_eabaej,1577214370.0,"The beginning of this brought back some bad memories.
On two occasions I had what they call a ""thunderclap"" during orgasm.  It's indescribable.    The PAIN.  You'd rather die than endure it. 

Truly something I'd have never believed was possible, but I felt it!
Anybody out there ever have one??
       Ha, ha ... and TWENTY minutes, could cum three times ! Cool."

TalkTherapy,fb1dwda,t1_faqs0ao,1576435505.0,"You seem to have an understanding of the whole mirroring thing.  I'll try really hard to be brief here , but lots of details are relevant... I'm hoping you can offer some advice as I am REALLY struggling. Close to being ""in crisis"".  So anyway...
          I have a long history of abuse. My first suicide attempt was at 4 1/2. The level of emotional deprivation was unbearable.  Enter into the school system. I was the ONLY kid in nursery school that didn't want to go home!  Bullied all through school. K -12. Tried college , drank daily , got kicked out. 
Years passed heavy into addiction.  
Finally got a ""career"" that I freaking LOVED. Good paying,  real purposeful career. . . But I was relentlessly bullied and physically abused. Any attempt to fight , stand up for myself was met with MY being disciplined! ! Till they fired me in 2001. Within four months of being fired I was diagnosed with stage 2C Hodgkins Lymphoma.  I'LL never forget the oncologist telling me ,""You know this was brought on by stress"".  Gee,  really?  Anyway,  six months of chemo. .. praying for God to let me die.... three months radiation .... cancer gone but holy fuck what it did to my body!!! Destroyed thyroid.. . Dependant on medication (daily reminder). LIFE IS HELL ! 
I fought for four and a half years only to get my job back BUT WITH ZERO BACKPAY, the $6,000 I DID get was taken by my lawyer AND I WAS FORCED to go to a facility an hour from where I lived , as opposed to the one I had been working at SEVEN MINUTES from my home which I purposely bought BY MY JOB! I begged to be allowed to return to where I'd been but they wouldn't budge! 
So after several years of driving all that way just to be ""kept away from former coworkers"". ... THEY CLOSED THAT FACILITY AND SENT MOST OF THOSE COWORKERS TO THE PLACE I WAS AT !  Can you wrap your head around that?  
In 2011 I was sexually assaulted by a supervisor. I reported it immediately and followed all reporting requirements. As a result,  I was suspended, the supervisor was promoted and they made my life a living hell until in Dec.of 2017 I went on approved disability leave to attempt to deal with the PTSD, depression,  SEVERE insomnia and suicidal thoughts. THEY FIRED ME ! 
        My therapist that had been stringing me along for over five years with me being ""STUCK"" FINALLY tells me he can't help me and that I need a trauma specialist!   
       So my current therapist specializes in trauma. He also is former law enforcement and can relate to my treatment in that field.  My being ""targeted"".   
      I'm telling you all this to explain I've already been down a LONG ROAD.  I'm running out of steam. Recently , I had to get honest with my therapist about the erotic transference and how it was so overwhelming it was interfering with therapy.  You know,  admitting you understand you don't really want to be ""penetrated"" by your therapist, but you desperately want to be held.... comforted. .. even rescued ! That is not an easy conversation! ! I think you can maybe relate to this ... I'm hoping , anyway.
      So , after all this. ... now.... I notice he's mirroring me. Not only in my movements and actions , but now ever in my appearance,  as in my clothing . 
I know I'm not crazy.  I wear dark clothes , always . and wear I t-shirt under a long sleeve shirt with the top  three buttons open. My therapist used to dress up , suit jacket , fancy socks , dress shoes ...  suddenly I had a meltdown and now , overnight , he's dressed LIKE ME!  Is it at all possible he's doing this without knowing ?? I mean it's a pretty drastic change ! It has caused me to dislike him,  to shut down. I feel betrayed , as he is trying to manipulate me!  Even mock me ? I have been through absolute hell. All 50 years of my my life ! I will not seek out another therapists .  This is it ! 
        Do I take a chance and try to talk to him about this ?  
        It's got me really upset , just the though of yet another uncomfortable conversation .  I don't know if it's worth it anymore.   Life is really unbearable . Desperately trying to make it through the ""holidays"". 
     Thank you  for reading this.  Take care !"
depression,fb15ljx,t1_faqfbc3,1576432634.0,"Lithium saved my life.  Long story , but , yea... I would definitely look into it. Best of luck to you. I'm 50 and attempted suicide the first time at 4 1/2.  :(
I STILL hate this world , but am convinced there's no way out until it's ""my time"".
You are NOT alone !"
depression,fb13cp7,t1_fafa8tl,1576431985.0,"Please don't consider ""ending it"".  Trust me , I know the feeling well. Been there,  done that !  
I've got three rescue dogs that are my sole companions and my only reason for living.  And that's ok with me! 
Find something to care for ... or volunteer somewhere if you have it in you.  Just keep going! :)
      You're not alone."
