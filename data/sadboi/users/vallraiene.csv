bathandbodyworks,fil4fij,t1_fik3n3x,1582493420.0,"i'm 18 and i work in a mall in austin, texas. it's more north austin so it's a little more suburban. i think the location could be an issue if it had to do with how busy you are, but i'm not sure.

i honestly love my job, and i think the majority of my coworkers do too. i wish i could pinpoint exactly why but i would guess that it's because we're all really close and never really get problematic customers (and when we do, we teamwork it and make jokes about it later). it's honestly the little things i like so much. like when a coworker grabs me and tries to get me to guess a product by smelling it with my eyes closed, or offers to make a starbucks run for everyone on their break, or when someone writes something funny or encouraging on the bathroom mirror with an expo marker (we're all super goofy together and it makes work not feel like work, but we still get our stuff done, and well, too. we've gotten people come back and buy more just because they wanted to say hi to us).

that's kind of a long answer and idk how helpful it is, but basically, we're all super close friends, and it's easier to be happy in a bad situation when you love the people you're with. not that i think working at BBW is bad, in fact i think it's the opposite."
bathandbodyworks,fil2k9c,t1_fiktxgd,1582492295.0,"we re-use pretty much everything. all the displays are made up of the same baskets, bowls, shelves, etc., and putting them together is like putting together a Lego set. we get a little slip with directions on it, flip things around and stack things so they look different than they actually are. it's kinda fun actually because we almost never have *exactly* what we need props and product wise so we can get creative with it. for example, we needed to spruce up a christmas display once because we were missing some stuff so we got gift ribbon and made tiny bows, then taped them all over the display. and it was adorable! they didn't stay up for very long because the tape sucked but it looked nice lol. whenever we change the displays, everything gets put in the back and brought out for the next floorset. unless we get stuff that's brand new. then they just ship it to us."
bathandbodyworks,fil1vw8,t1_fikipe5,1582491878.0,"that's not a dumb question! made me laugh actually. my advice would be ditch the wallflowers (they smell like nothing IMO) and get candles. 3-wicks are $10 off right now so it's a good time. if you want something strong, the high intensity mahogany teakwood is very strong, hence the name. it all depends on what smells you like though! i'm not a candle expert honestly so if you wanted i could ask my coworkers? i'm happy to help :)"
bathandbodyworks,fil1cnh,t1_fikce01,1582491550.0,"semi-annual sale is mainly where we get rid of our extra discontinued and seasonal scents, so if there's any leftover, it'll be there. honestly i haven't seen a ton of people buying the strawberry pound cake products, but that's just in my store and could be different where you live. if no one else wants em, then they'll be there. if you don't wanna take the chance, get them now! the strawberry pound cake is my favorite of the new scents so it's nice to see it getting some love:)"

mysticmessenger,f0teioa,t3_d6f054,1568920705.0,"i love jumin, but hate his route. he feels like a totally different character. in the rest of the game he's very unintentionally funny and caring in a dorky kind of way... but you don't get that at all in his route. the closest thing to real jumin in his route would be in the one scene where he reads to mc, but that's it. other than that he's really kind of weird and says a lot of things that are unnerving. so yeah, this bad ending is the sole reason... but it's because it's so out of character. i just don't understand it."

NoStupidQuestions,f0t47zz,t1_f0t2x2b,1568915641.0,"think of it like a rewritten version of the story for fun, or a totally different story with the same characters. it's usually a fanfiction/fanart thing. OP mentioned a genderbend au, which is just a universe where everything in the story is the same but the characters' genders are swapped. a high school au would follow the characters in high school. some people might make an au of another story, like putting the characters in story A in the situations of the characters in story B. harry potter AUs seem to be common, for example."

NoStupidQuestions,f0t1w8i,t3_d6h6s2,1568914522.0,"IMO it's a good way to explore your characters and get to know them better. it'll also be good for writers block- you can work on your AU to get you warmed up, then get back to the real story.

be careful, though. my friend and i were writing a story and started making AUs (not like fandom AUs, i mean ""what if this character was good instead of evil"" and ""what if this person had magic power(s)"" AUs) and now they all exist in our story in the form of different timelines. meaning our protagonist has time powers and keeps creating these different universes. and this literally started because we wanted to explore her dating a different character, and then gave her new boyfriend time powers too and things got out of hand.

i guess what i'm trying to say is you're gonna get attached to the AU, so like, if you're gonna give yourself ""fanservice"" be ready for the consequences."
