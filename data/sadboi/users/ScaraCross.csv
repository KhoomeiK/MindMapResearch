I'm a teen living with her mom and sometimes we dogsit my sibling's gremlin, a shih tzu + lhasa apso. This was one of those times.

The dog liked sleeping with me in my loft bed (even if getting down terrified him- I had to carry him down the small set of stairs every time). That night, everything was normal and we fell asleep.

I was really sleepy in the morning, so even though I was awake, I kept my eyes closed and tried going back to sleep. I smelled something bad so I covered my nose with the blankets. I simply thought the dog farted.

When I finally opened my eyes and decided to get up... It was a literal shitstorm. I was smelling shit. Liquid. All over the bed. The dog was trembling in terror. There was no safe surface: it was like during the night, he kept moving to cleaner spots and then ruined them with his merciless shitting.

I think I blocked out the memory of how the mess was cleaned up. All I remember was I took a VERY LONG, VERY HOT SHOWER as soon as I could."
