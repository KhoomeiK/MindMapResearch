Scams,fpp8ism,t1_fpp81c7,1588797797.0,That's what I'm saying. Addresses are definitely weird and the policies are definitely shady. I made this reddit post because most of the time when I can't find something in a Google search I at least find it on reddit and I couldn't find anything on this. I had searched up and went ahead and paid because I could find anyone really saying they had a bad experience with the company.
Scams,fpoxr3r,t1_fpox54u,1588792477.0,I would hope it is real but the shipping number is definitely sketchy. The contact info is non existent. The claims to be an American company but coming out of china. I would rather have a dud product than none but I know it's not going to be legitimately what is advertised.

And not responsible for any incorrect product or any disappointment in services.

Unemployment,focysfa,t1_focfvxi,1587677668.0,I'm not fully sure what is actually in legal documentation. I do believe you are correct but politicians talk out of their ass sometimes. I would try to get up with DES if at all possible.
legaladvice,foc706q,t1_foc69ee,1587667846.0,Your employer could alter the status. Especially if he had you simply listed as reduced hours and you end up quitting. It sounds like this whole thing is a sticky situation on your employers end. I would suggest contacting your employer directly and talking with him/her but from a legal standpoint he is supposed to add to file that you quit. My best advice would be to go ahead and contact your employer and attempt to contact NC unemployment yourself but they can be difficult to reach at the moment.
legaladvice,foc4vbq,t1_foc4mzg,1587667129.0,"Forgot to add, they can see it from mandatory tax forms that would have to be submitted with your payroll. They wouldn't need to contact your employer to see if you were still receiving income from work."
legaladvice,foc4mzg,t1_foc3t6h,1587667050.0,Being that you continued to work for a month they are able to find and document that income. Not sure if you have told them you were still working or not but if you were receiving your normal income from work while receiving unemployment benefits they can take legal action on you. I know you want to continue receiving benefits but I would definitely try to cover your bases for any previously received benefits.
NorthCarolina,foc4758,t1_foc2lyd,1587666911.0,"I tried calling Bank of America myself and they told me I would have to contact DES. Everytime I have called it says they are not accepting phone calls due to high call volumes. I have no way to see if it was shipped, delivered, activated etc because it will not let anyone access the account unless you input the card info. The system is flawed and definitely lacking necessary communication. I hope you are able to get yours soon or figure something out. They need to make some changes, get with the times. Modern issues require modern solutions."
Unemployment,foc3lir,t3_g5pmt8,1587666719.0,When applying for unemployment there is always a question asking if you're able to receive severance pay. In addition you have to complete a weekly certification to receive your benefits each week and that question is reiterated each week. So I definitely feel severance pay could be delaying your unemployment and that is if it doesn't cause it to be denied altogether.
legaladvice,foc2nuk,t3_g6rkw4,1587666425.0,If the state finds out you and some of your coworkers quit rather than got laid off there could be legal issues to come your way. Unemployment is very rarely given to someone who voluntarily quits a job and they may demand a payback on the amount recieved.
NorthCarolina,foc1oig,t3_g24687,1587666115.0,Did you ever receive your card OP? I am going on 7 of the quoted 10 days and hoping it shows up soon. They really should have some form of tracking or monitoring. You can't access the account without the card number so someone could steal it and you wouldn't actually know.

mentalhealth,f696el1,t3_dqkfx0,1572736540.0,We are proud of you bro.  Go buy something stupid.  No sarcasm intended.
mentalhealth,f48yooc,t1_f48ydm1,1571452598.0,"I remember things but I often have to try harder than most people to remember simple things like what I ate, did I eat, did I shower, or if I did anything to take care of myself. Brewers yeast seems to be my current miracle drug and that is not to say it will work for anyone else but it is working for me despite there being no mental health benefits displayed online. Once again I thank you for your question as you're the only one who seems to care enough to ask questions tbh."
mentalhealth,f48vwsa,t1_f48vdkh,1571450389.0,"If you feel the need to go to the hospital do not hesitate.  If you feel it is a crisis do not hesitate.  I work at a hospital and I know if you call with a mental health crisis, they will mostlikely send an ambulance.  Do what you need to do to to take care of yourself or you will never get better.  If you want to get better you need to take care of yourself.  No need to thank me, I am just doing what I need to help.  I would like to think someone would do the same if I were struggling.  Call emergency services and explain everything.  Add me, I am here to help."
mentalhealth,f48to2c,t1_f48sxht,1571448589.0,"That is a hard question to answer but it puts a smile on my face to even see that question.  I never know what personality I will wake up with or if it will switch suddenly.  I go from a redneck to a computer geek or a wannabe thug or an emo kid.  It can switch as much as every few hours or every few weeks.  If I have no personality to associate with I often dissociate and that leads to me not fully knowing what is going on or what to do because my head feels cloudy just like spacing out.  This causes issues as I work in security and often times something will happen and it will take me a few more seconds than usual to process or respond to the situation.  When dissociating I often have an identity crisis and do not know who I am and can hardly grasp where I am, what time it is, or what day it is.  When I am invested in a personality the different personalities affect different behaviors.  If I feel like a hippy or I am deeply spiritual I am loving and forgiving.  If I feel like a thug or a redneck I often pick a fight.  That is not to say people in those categories act that way, it is just how I often act.  It also affects security and how I respond to situations.  My biggest problem is no matter the personality, I don't care enough about myself and care too much about other people.  I will neglect a bill to buy a gift someone really wants to chase their satisfaction as no one was satisfied with my behavior and my parents were never proud of me which led to this disorder.  I often have hobbies and the hobbies are attached to personalities.  Therefor I could be a good writer if the writer personality stayed present or a good coder/developer if the computer geek stayed present but I lose interest in things as personalities switch.  So at an age when I should be in college, it is harder for me to pick a major than others and I cannot complete most tasks I begin.  Thank you for the question."
mentalhealth,f48rrn7,t1_f48rlbk,1571447074.0,"Well it would be best to come clean about how you are currently feeling.  Tell your parents, your therapist, your psych.  They cannot help you if you do not tell the truth.  I personally had an attachment to my knives when going through this but the best thing I did while in highschool was let my parents confiscate them."

mentalhealth,f48psby,t1_f48oy70,1571445457.0,"I have often thought the same thing.  The reason of thinking this is we want to die but we want to die in a natural way as it will provide our family more closure than suicide will but this is still not a healthy way of thinking.  Whether is be by suicide, an issue in everyday life, or natural causes there are still people who care about you that would be in total agony and heartbreak to see you go.  Reach out to them and let them know how you feel, just don't blame them as that can make matters worse.  I thank you for reaching out.  The initial reach is the hardest part and you are stronger than most for doing so but I do suggest attempting to get more help from a medical professional.  I don't know if you have anyone that believes in you but I do.  You are a beautiful human being and you will make it through this as long as you do what you need to do to take care of yourself."
mentalhealth,f48pf0v,t3_djwejd,1571445164.0,"It seems you suffer from a sort of dissociative disorder, possible borderline personality disorder.  Take that with a grain of salt as I do not have the educational backing to represent that sufficiently.  I just know I suffer from these things and the worst times are when I lose sight of who I am and often have an identity crisis that can last a whole month.  You did right in reaching out and I suggest attempting to get help from an actual medical professional.  You are not weak for sharing this, you are stronger than most for being able to talk about it.  Everyone has their own personal issues and it takes a degree of strength to open up.  Keep your head up and keep moving forward.  The grass is greener on the other side, you just have to make it there."
mentalhealth,f48p30k,t3_djw1xs,1571444894.0,"Mental health has always had a stigma that we were weaker than others or that we cannot handle life.  The fact of the matter is most of us are much more intelligent than the average human and we suffer from these things because we see the reality that no one else does.  Because of this, it is harder for us in life.  It is harder for us to choose to live.  So we are essentially stronger than most for choosing to keep moving forward.  Getting help is always the best answer and your parents should be understanding for the most part.  The stigma is not as bad as it once was.  Keep your head up and keep moving forward.  The grass is greener on the other side you just have to make it there."
mentalhealth,f48oswx,t3_djwcrl,1571444664.0,"I often do but at the same time I think about how the people in my life will be affected.  We often have tunnel vision when dealing with mental health issues and we have to remember that more people care than we often think.  There is someone in everyones life that cares and we have to keep moving forward for those people.  Suicide is not the answer, it is actually part of the problem.  Reach out and get help when you get these thoughts.  Many people would happily help you out of this mental state.  Keep your head up and keep moving forward.  As long as you do that, you will be okay."
mentalhealth,f48okpl,t3_djvw4v,1571444480.0,"Plenty of people have OCD, anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, and even severe depression and do not have suicidal thoughts.  Mental health issues is more than just suicidal thoughts but the stigma leads everyone to believe that is all mental health issues are.  Many of us never even think of harming ourselves or others.  Wanting to not exist or to escape does not always classify as suicidal thought.  I hope you are doing okay.  I hope things get better for you.  The grass is greener on the other side and as long as you keep moving forward you will make it to that ""somewhere over the rainbow"" that we all dream about.  Mental health has it's ups and downs you just have to learn to appreciate the peaks and remember them while in the pitfalls.  You are not going insane.  You will be okay, just keep your head up."

I am not sure if you have this issue but I do and drive myself to recklessness trying to help others. Just gotta remind myself. You cant always put everyone else first.
mentalhealth,f2xt124,t3_denbyg,1570482180.0,The numb can often be worse than the pain but the emptiness will always subside. Find something to look forward to. Do something that makes you happy.

mentalhealth,f2xsdo1,t3_denk76,1570481967.0,"You are a wonderful person. Often times a lot of us with mental health issues cannot maintain a relationship and we end up the enemy. Rumors spread about our lives and being exposed by an ex that just doesnt understand why ""he/she makes us so miserable"".  The important thing to remember is he is not mad at you. You did nothing to make him depressed or suicidal. Dont blame yourself. Just try to be an ear to hear. Ranting can be excessive but just let him air it out.

AskReddit,f265lt9,t3_dbrmin,1569994397.0,"I had finally made it to high-school, what I thought was the big time.  I had been a nerd and a loser my entire life and no one I knew was going to the high-school I chose so I began to reassess who I am.  I decided to flip the script from being a loser to being a loser and creating a thug.  None of my classmates attempted to check my backstory but the thugs chose to become more extreme and I was forced to join a gang.  I will not disclose what gang but I participated in illicit activity and eventually ended up an addict trying to keep up with the fake title I gave myself.  The addiction quickly consumed and I became homeless trying to find my footing again to try to regain the person I once was.  I had dropped out of high-school but with no financial support and copious amounts of debt I went in to made it nearly impossible for me to get back into schooling.  Getting a GED was easy but my family still refused to even be there for me and I spent a lot of time with no one by my side due to all the bridges I had burnt and how I treated everyone.  It took me a long time to get over the addiction and I threw away everything I had just to try to be a cool kid.  Now I am a shitty security guard, making shitty pay, to live a shitty life.  Really hoping to find a way to go back to college while also working full time in order to support myself and in the future.  I had a genius IQ, was incredibly musically inclined, and was a great football player but I threw it all away for high-school fame and cocaine.  Now I cannot rid myself from the mental health issues from addiction and the trauma of abandonment and homelessness."
