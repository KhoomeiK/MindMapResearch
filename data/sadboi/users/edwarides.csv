He's been against funding abortion pretty much his entire career. He will not stand strong on abortion. He never has. He once said, **“I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body.”** 

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/joe-biden-roe-v-wade-quote/

https://theintercept.com/2020/03/07/joe-biden-abortion-rights/

He was a segregationist. He was one of the leading voices in the Senate against desegregating busing. Here's a quote of him saying it's racist to desegregate schools:

“That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with,” he added. “What it says is, in order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes, and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son. That’s racist! **Who the hell do we think we are, that the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child?”**

He still opposes busing, to this day.

He voted for DOMA (the Defense Of Marriage Act), an act that specifically aimed to define marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman to prevent the recognition of gay marriage.

https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-who-voted-for-doma-2013-3

Here's a video:

https://youtu.be/TcshbDQqQ7c?t=135

He helped with the writing of the 1994 ""tough on crime"" Crime Bill, which is in part responsible for the mass incarnation of racial minorities we see today.

As recently as 2016, Biden defended the law, arguing it “restored American cities” following an era of high crime and violence. 

On the website for his 2008 presidential campaign, Biden referred to the 1994 crime law as the “Biden Crime Law” and bragged that it encouraged states to effectively increase their prison sentences by paying them to build more prisons — a direct endorsement of more incarceration. 

 https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-10994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration

As for Supreme Court justices, he voted for Scalia. He pushed through Clarence Thomas. He'll propose a centrist, get rejected, then just put more conservatives on the court. He'll fold like a wet paper towel.

""The Senate, whose Republican majority would be unlikely to embrace any selection seen as particularly liberal, must confirm nominees picked for lifetime appointments to the nation’s highest court.

“'There are plenty of judges who are on high courts already who have had unanimous support of the Republicans. This should be someone who, in fact, is a consensus and whereby we can generate enough support to get a person passed,' Biden said.""

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-obama-biden-idUSKCN0VR2EK

Biden is a conservative himself, so he won't even try to put someone ideologically left on the SC at all.

""Vice President Joe Biden says President Obama should put forth a relatively non-ideological nominee to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — someone in the mold of Justice Anthony Kennedy or retired Justice David Souter, as opposed to a liberal icon in the footsteps of former Justice William Brennan.""

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/19/in-interview-biden-suggests-obamas-supreme-court-pick-shouldnt-be-too-liberal/

This list isn't even exhaustive. The shitshow with this man goes on and on. 

The entire point of Biden's campaign wasn't to win. It was to kneecap the Bernie campaign. And they were willing to murder Americans and rig the election to do so, making people go out to vote during a global pandemic, with many polling locations in retirement homes, punishing states that attempted to delay the primaries. Even before the pandemic, the DNC never cared about democracy, closing polling locations despite long wait lines, disenfranchising the poor.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/dnc-memo-primary-delays-could-result-delegate-reduction

This isn't democracy, it's an oligarchy where the corporatists present an illusion of choice between one racist rapist and another racist rapist, a good civil cop and a bad strong man cop, neither of whom will threaten the class interests of the rich.

He helped with the writing of the 1994 ""tough on crime"" Crime Bill, which is in part responsible for the mass incarnation of racial minorities we see today.

As recently as 2016, Biden defended the law, arguing it “restored American cities” following an era of high crime and violence. 

On the website for his 2008 presidential campaign, Biden referred to the 1994 crime law as the “Biden Crime Law” and bragged that it encouraged states to effectively increase their prison sentences by paying them to build more prisons — a direct endorsement of more incarceration.

This isn't even exhaustive. The shitshow with this man goes on and on.

This isn't democracy, it's an oligarchy where the corporatists present an illusion of choice between one racist rapist and another racist rapist, a good civil cop and a bad strong man cop, neither of whom will threaten the class interests of the rich.

Those of us who are privileged enough to be able to vote, since a huge chunk of Americans can't, ought to vote for those who uphold principles we actually believe in, not for dubiously ""lesser"" evil every election."

You're blaming people for not capitulating with this disgusting rigged system. Forcing us to pick between a good cop and a bad cop is not a real choice. So stop victim blaming. If either of these rapists win, it's not leftists fault for refusing to vote for them."
