‚ÄúThe accumulated reduction in knee load for a 1-pound loss in weight would be more than 4,800 pounds per mile walked,"" writes researcher Stephen P. Messier, PhD, of Wake Forest University in the July issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism. ""For people losing 10 pounds, each knee would be subjected to 48,000 pounds less in compressive load per mile walked.""

https://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/news/20050629/small-weight-loss-takes-pressure-off-knee

‚ÄúOur results indicate that each pound of weight lost will result in a 4-fold reduction in the load exerted on the knee per step during daily activities. Accumulated over thousands of steps per day, a reduction of this magnitude would appear to be clinically meaningful.‚Äù
