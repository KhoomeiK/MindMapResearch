AskReddit,fqjf56h,t3_giz37i,1589409064.0,"In Dragon Age: Inquisition, when Solas says ""Ar lath ma, Vhenan,"" it translates to ""I love you, my heart,"" which means that ""VHENAN"" ALONE translates as ""my heart"" and not all this additive ""ma vhenan"" nonsense you see in fan works. If you turn subtitles on, you will see his sentence is formatted this way, and we call this DIRECT ADDRESS format, which means the noun after the comma in the sentence is the object being addressed. If ""ma vhenan"" meant ""my heart"" it would be written, ""Ar lath, ma vhenan,"" BUT IT IS NOT FORMATTED THIS WAY. THEREFORE, we may concluded that ONLY ""vhenan"" means ""my heart"" and everyone that ever writes ""ma vhenan"" no matter how pretty the fanart, or how good the fanfiction, is STRAIGHT UP WRONG. THANK YOU for coming to my Ted Talk.

HaircareScience,fhz6zte,t1_fhj51ri,1581992304.0,"I'm so sorry, I totally forgot to answer this. It can depend on your budget-- I prefer to use salon quality brands, which can range from $20-40 a bottle, but I find they last quite a long time and work beautifully on the hair, so for me it's worth it. Some of the better brands I've tried include Pureology, Redken, Joico, L'occitane. In the $20 range you could look into Matrix Biolage or Living Proof brands. 

HOWEVER, you don't have to break the bank. Shea Moisture makes a nice moisture retention shampoo/conditioner line, and their ingredients are very nice, and I believe they can be in the $10-15 range. You basically want to look for really good ingredients, i.e. not too many alcohols, good essential oils like avocado, grape seed, olive, or things like honey, shea butter, and aloe are good too. Silicones really aren't terrible (dimethicone, etc.), but I would avoid parabens as they can affect your estrogen hormone levels. The bottle should say sulfate and paraben free. I've heard good things about OGX and Garnier Fructis, but I haven't used them. 

I HIGHLY recommend SheaMoisture if you're on a budget. They have great ingredients, and I use their skincare regularly with nice effects. You want hydrating formulas, so make sure it says moisture/ hydration/ humectant or something to this effect on the bottle. I hope this helps!"

HaircareScience,fh0apua,t3_f0twtq,1581201911.0,"Ok, so here's the thing: no, a shampoo change will not help. I looked up Emerge shampoo & conditioner, and even though it's pretty cheap, it seems to have some good ingredients. No sulfates, parabens, mineral oil, silicones, etc. This is a really good thing. If your hair is dry from dyeing a lot, aka it's been damaged, there is no actual way to repair hair damage except to maybe use a product like Olaplex, which will help make damaged hair more manageable, but this is a temporary fix until you get new, healthy hair growth back. 

Based on what you are describing, this is likely NOT A SHAMPOO issue, but rather your hair is dry and damaged from being over dyed, and the dryness is coming from broken bonds and missing molecules in your hair core. 

Basically, your hair has two main parts: the cuticle, which you can think of sort of like snake scales on the outside of your hair strand, which act as a protective cover to the CORE, which is the second part, and where all the melanin of your hair color is stored. When you dye your hair (with permanent color), the cuticles open up and allow the dye to deposit chemicals which change the color molecules at the core of your hair. However, as you re-dye or strip away color, the color molecules in the core of your hair strand will wash out and sometimes if you do this too much your hair becomes damaged and stripped. There's no real way to undo this damage until you allow more hair to grow out. Changing shampoo or conditioner CANNOT repair this damage, however if you use a good product, it CAN prevent further damage from occuring. As I said, there are ways you can ""cover up"" this damage with products like Olaplex, which is one of the only products that actually goes back into your hair core and deposits new molecules to restore the stripping and repair broken hair molecule bonds.

The routine you have is already pretty good, though I would maybe add a nice hair oil in between wash days to keep the hair hydrated. Your hair is dry and stripped from damage, and as I said shampoo can't really fix that. Your best bet is to keep using good, gentle products, and wait for new hair growth, and basically just protect your hair from further damage. You can try using Olaplex if your hair is really way too damaged to be manageable, but that's one of the only things that has a chance of ""repairing"" the damage that's been done. I hope this helps. 

Just as a side note: haircare science is NOT bullshit. There's really a reason some products work better than others. Your cuticles can be damaged and so can your core, and products with lots of fillers (silicones, parabens, etc.) really act as ""filler"" which make your hair SEEM shiny and healthy, but really it's the equivalent of coating your hair in microscopic waxes. It doesn't actually do anything, it's just a good fake. Other more expensive products, or products with good formulas, actually use ingredients which can help keep the cuticle and core healthy and prevent damage-- think humectant (hydrating) ingredients like natural oils, shea butter, aloe, etc. Haircare is just as much of a science as good skin care, and if you find a good salon professional, they will help you understand this. It's not a scam. If you want nice hair, you have to know how to take care of it and what products to invest in, and WHY it matters."

AskReddit,ff4lref,t3_erhu3x,1579566684.0,"I have several. I dream vividly a LOT. There's a recurring dream I have where I can use this little white hand-held device to fly. It looks like a little remote, and you just lift it into the air and you can ""ride the wind"". I remember one time I used it to fly on top of a freight train while it was moving, and I sat on top of one of the cars and watched the scenery as it rode along. It was a beautiful landscape near the ocean, beautiful blue sky, warm sunshine, and green forest. It was so peaceful sitting on top of that train car riding along. 


A lot of the times I can just fly. I'll be doing something in a dream and remember ""oh yeah, I can fly"" and I just take off. I was in ""San Francisco"" in my dream, but I got lost. I was really scared in the city, but then I remembered I could fly, so I took off and flew up above the clouds. I sat up in the air above the clouds, with the sun shining on me and enjoyed the peace of being up in the sky. I love flying dreams. 

Last night I had a dream I went to a magic school. It wasn't like Harry Potter, it was more like a brick American college campus in the south, with lots of willow trees and shade everywhere. The buildings were really ornate and gorgeous. We took little trolleys to move between the buildings, and there was a trolley schedule. At night, some dream friends and I were walking around campus when a thunderstorm came on, but it was a ""magic"" thunderstorm, and it lit up the sky in all different colors (blue, purple, green, etc.) like fireworks, but it was all lightning and colorful clouds. It started to pour rain so we ran over to a nearby building, which turned out to be a dorm hall. It had floating lights, and plants that would bite you if you got too close. I snuck up to the upper dorms which were ""off limits"" where the more powerful upperclassmen lived. There was a really ornate staircase going up the center of the building, with ledges where you could look down all the way to the bottom floor. I got caught by some of the upperclassmen who began to chase me with wands, and I jumped over the staircase railing and sailed down to the bottom floor, as if I could sort of fly. They followed me down, but I woke up soon after. 

Another dream that was really long and elaborate was: I was camping with my family in the woods. Then these government guys with guns showed up hunting something, in military gear. All of a sudden some ""Predator"" style targets fell on them and they were shot with a weapon that made their organs explode out of their body. My family and I ran scared and got separated and I wound up in a small mountain town, which was being invaded by alien ships that looked like little white planes. They blasted people War of the World style with beams that would make their organs explode out of their body. I wound up fleeing with a group of survivors, and it was like a week long expedition where we kept travelling to different shelters, trying to hide from the aliens. We slept in a barn, on the ground in the cornfield, we sailed across a lake on a rowboat to get to a more secret safehouse in the woods where other survivors were hiding. After hiding for a while, the aliens eventually disappeared and we went back out into the world to find survivors. I met an old man in an abandoned park in the middle of the country who was meeting up with his wife (they got separated) and he gave me his other car so I could try to find my family. I started driving down an abandoned road with cars and bodies all over, and I woke up soon after that. 

Another time I had a dream that I had a little brother (I don't) and we were trapped together in a haunted house. We spent a long time trying to escape, and when we finally got out, we were halfway across the yard when something came out and dragged my little brother back inside. I screamed his name, but then I woke up. I was sad the rest of the day thinking I somehow failed to save this little brother that never existed. 


Some of them are scary, but still kind of exciting and interesting. Sometimes I want to go back and find out or explore more of that world.

Edit: Not sure what the downvotes are for. I was just excited for a chance to share cool/ vivid dreams."

horror,fel00bk,t1_fdqfheu,1579211142.0,"I really agree with this 100%. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and felt like it was very much a sort of throw-back homage to the style of films like the first Alien movies. A lot of critics are complaining that it's too derivative of Aliens' style, but I actually was very excited when I noticed the similarities and really enjoyed it even MORE for that reason. To me, it felt much more like an homage than a ripoff. In my opinion, you can tell this film was crafted with a love of monster movies. 

Critics are really slamming this film for being ""unoriginal"" with poor science, but in my opinion it gave me everything I wanted. I'm not really the type to nit-pick that concrete can't be in an underwater base (does the average audience member even know this??), or that the suits are ""unrealistic"". I thought the suits were very cool, and scenes filmed inside them were claustrophobic and very effective. The deaths with them, as you mentioned, gave us great gore for a PG-13 film. 

The non-stop action and laser tight focus is something else I really agree with. Right from the beginning, the film is like ""ok, you're here, buckle the fuck up because here we go"" and I loved that. It gets right into it, and it's exciting from start to finish. 

It is a FANTASTIC creature feature with excellent monster design. I thought the characters were charming and we had juuust enough to care about them, but not in a way that distracts at all from the film. I suppose some people might call this shallow characterization, but I didn't feel that way at all. Even TJ Miller I found to be funny in the moment (""This better not be some 20,000 leagues under the sea shit!""). 

The voice overs were so minimal, I didn't mind them at all. We get some insight into KS's character, and then they really keep that technique to a minimum as to not distract from the action. 

I agree with the critique that some of the scenes were too chaotic underwater to understand what was happening, but they were so few and far between that it really isn't that bad. For most of the film, you get a clear view and understanding of what's going on, so I can forgive that. 

Overall, I think this film is faaaantastic if you love creature features and scary underwater adventures. I wish we had more high-budget horror films like this. In my house, it goes on the shelf as an instant classic because it was just so much fun, with such great monsters and action. I hope more people give it a chance, as I really think it deserves to find its creature-loving audience."

AskReddit,fcmobna,t3_ehxmpw,1577784114.0,"I outline a lot of fluffy fanfiction. I don’t really flesh it out that much, but sometimes I do little sections with more detail. It’s never erotic, it’s just adorable and elaborate romances, not that there is anything wrong with erotica. I like to reread it at night and then fall asleep imagining the cute stories unfolding. 

Also, I record and edit some of the video games I play into TV-series like episodes. Also, I have a Simblr that’s pretty casual, but I like to post my little Sims stories on it. I think I’m embarrassed because it’s all boring slice of life stories that aren’t very creative. 

And I really like to listen to ASMR all the time, but everyone pretty much knows that. I even listen to it while I work, or sometimes if I’m stressed in an airport or something. 

Sometimes I talk out loud about these little hobbies like I’m on an interview talk show, to myself when no one is home. It can go on for a long time! 

And I record myself singing a lot with my home studio, but I’m too shy to ever share it."

Edit: I guess I’m getting downvoted because this sounds like I’m a corporate shill... but he really is sweet and cares about his job. It makes me sad that sales people get such a bad rep... he supports our whole family with that job. I really meant what I said and they do have mattresses that fit this budget very nicely.

AskReddit,fawd65a,t3_ealj7k,1576369354.0,"I got my dad a big watercolor painting by a local artist here. He lives across the country, and it has ocean landscape from around where I live, but best of all: painted in the distance is the exact schooner ship we spotted while flying over the bay a few years ago. We went on a scenic tour in the air and saw a ""pirate ship"" with full sails up, and I later found out it's one training schooner used in the area called the Zodiac. The painting even has the ship's name in the title, and it's really beautiful. I'm going to get it framed for him. I think it will remind him of all of his trips out here and tie into a nice memory we share. :D"

horror,fafixof,t3_e8t9u0,1576023906.0,"This is more of a general one, but the FAILURE TO DOUBLE-TAP. A villain is chasing the protag and the protag only shoots or hits the villain ONCE. The villain falls down, vulnerable, and then the protag DECIDES TO GET CLOSER AND INVESTIGATE?? The villain almost always pop back up and gets the upper hand again. No. Fuck that. Shoot them again. Beat them to death while they're down on the ground, shoot their knees out, beat their face in-- literally anything other than looming over them and wondering ""are they dead?"" When characters fail to do this, it ALWAYS pisses me off. You were just terrorized and nearly killed. WHY would you risk investigating if they're still alive? Do something to MAKE SURE they're down for good once they get hit. Always double-tap, people."

botw,f8by1qt,t3_e00iig,1574447963.0,"For me personally, I found the trick with these is to get really good at deflecting their shots back with your shield. They were really scary when I first started the game, but at this point I find them kinda fun to fight now that I have a good system. All they do is run up to you and shoot you with the beam-- they have no other attack. Once you get good at deflecting that beam back to them, it becomes a whole different experience!
