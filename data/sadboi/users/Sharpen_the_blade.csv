gravelcycling,fnw5ynv,t3_g0mxvt,1587312104.0,Just wandering what height are you and what size frame did you get?

learnjava,fb7xoz5,t3_eby97i,1576601704.0,Have a look at ‘Java in two semesters’ book. Found it easy to learn from. That and some side projects should get you some foundation in Java.

UKPersonalFinance,f2ztn0r,t1_f2zgfha,1570538121.0,"Ok I’ll let him know. Thanks again for all your help!

!thanks"
UKPersonalFinance,f2zdj9x,t1_f2xn8cl,1570516141.0,Nah it was no where near £48k. But some of the records might not be up to date as some of the exchanges he used have since shut down and vanished.
UKPersonalFinance,f2xmxf7,t1_f2vgty2,1570480195.0,Yeah that's correct although from what he tells me he's tried to 'trade' so made a bit here and there and lost some in between but on a whole he went from £1000 --> £300 --> £1000. But still presumably he wouldn't have to report and no tax to pay right?
juststart,f2beb3l,t1_f29av5z,1570125311.0,I meant amazon affiliate links so you wouldn’t have to speak to companies
juststart,f27z0mr,t3_dceus9,1570049097.0,Why don’t you review some mobile Bluetooth controllers and other devices like battery cases so people can play longer and just add in affiliate links
swift,f1n711l,t3_da3mi4,1569610442.0,Looks nice. Currently downloading. How long did it take you in all? Have you any other programming experience?
FreetradeApp,f0l8mqo,t1_f0l8bxb,1568703944.0,"Right, thanks so much again. Was a bit hesitant about buying shares if I had to pay stamp duty separately. I’ll give it a go!"
FreetradeApp,f0l8578,t1_f0l7lyj,1568703204.0,Thanks for the response. Is the stamp duty included in the share prices on Freetrade?
cscareerquestionsEU,eyt5rqi,t3_cynxv7,1567426122.0,My advise would be to apply. I’m in a totally unrelated field and have no experience. I did put on my application that I had done some online courses but no formal qualification. From this alone I have been offered a place by two universities.
cscareerquestionsEU,ew1n5ih,t1_ew1my8j,1565027050.0,I’m another forum people have contacted the admin team of the university. Some say the transcript online will have ‘online’ and others have been told it would state ‘online’ on the certificate. And in such a modern field like CS I’m hopping by gaining it online it wouldn’t be held against me.
cscareerquestionsEU,ew1myne,t1_ew1mt0f,1565026929.0,I work in a completely unrelated field but have had an interest in programming for a few years and have dabbled with a few languages.
passive_income,eqhpyvw,t3_byhdds,1560066912.0,"Problem with most of the POS coins are they tend to be scams and pump once and that’s it. By the time it’s comes to selling there’s no volume.

Anything decent will have low yields. It’s possible to make decent money but you’d need a bit to start off.

Another problem comes if the market crashes you’re stuck with your coins in a stake pool and not the exchange."
zenbot,eqe2z3e,t3_by6jij,1559998619.0,Check Twitter. Supposedly some update.
GEKKO,eq9cefn,t1_eq93pln,1559899595.0,Thanks for the reply. I’ll have to look more into pm2. Those are pretty good results. Going to look into RSI bull bear adx today too see if that yields any decent results.
GEKKO,eq77rxm,t3_bbc29r,1559841995.0,"I’ve been playing around with the BULL BEAR RSI strategy in back tests. Found that the best results came from settings like yours. Are you still live trading this strat?

Or any other strat?

Also what’s the pm2"
