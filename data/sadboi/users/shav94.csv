actuallesbians,fos2vjf,t3_g8ile3,1588022978.0,So glad to see some he/him positivity around here! I get hate from the straights and a lot from the community but I am who I am.
butchlesbians,fnrzpu6,t1_fnrzdyt,1587207785.0,"That’s totally fine, personally I always discuss this with my partners first. So far no one, not even  through-and-through lesbians, has had a problem with it. Guess it’s just that good."
butchlesbians,fnrr6ew,t3_g3jket,1587198481.0,"1. I use chest too, as for what’s down there, it’s my dick
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ that’s just me though, and I’m nb. I’m also stone so my partners don’t have much to do with my actual anatomy down there.

2. Yeah, I get like that too. I have a couple generic responses for when I need a minute to gather my thoughts, like “that’s so hot” “thank you so much for trusting me with this”, etc. it’s also fine to just say “I’m really turned on, give me a minute.” And practice makes perfect. I know communicating your feelings is hard but if you tell your partner that this is something you enjoy but you’re still figuring out, they’ll understand and It’ll probably make you feel better.

3. YES. I’m like that too, but now I’d consider myself an experienced top. Again here, communication is key. Having consent oriented conversations with your partner (sometimes I find these easier over text) will boost your confidence in this area. It’s perfectly acceptable, and good practice, to ask your partner what they want you to do to them, where their limits lie, how they like to be touched, and so on in a non-sexual, frank setting. That way you can visualize in your head how things might go, and it’ll make maintaining communication in a sexual setting easier.

4. Yeah. Unfortunately I’m in the same boat as you. Looking to intersectional feminism helps, as does reminding myself that my values dictate everyone, including myself, is entitled to feelings. If you’re in therapy you’re already on the right track to overcoming this."

lgbt,fn7wbq7,t3_g04dve,1586728940.0,"He/him lesbian here.

I’ll start by saying that I think this is something different for everyone.

I often hear people try to explain he/him lesbians as women who just happen to use he/him because pronouns don’t necessarily reflect gender identity, which is true.

However, I feel that he/him pronouns ARE a reflection of my gender identity. As a butch, I feel alienated from womanhood, but also reject cis masculinity. Also as a butch, I experience dysphoria. This helps alleviate that. 

Why do I identify then as a lesbian instead of a straight man? I think I went through a lot to come out as a lesbian, and I (and many people I know) went through a lot at the hands of the patriarchy. For those reasons I prefer to maintain my position as a lesbian in the community rather than claiming a wholly male identity.

Hope that makes sense. Feel free to dm with any further questions, and I’d encourage you to speak with and listen to the he/him lesbians in your life."

BPD,fn2msqv,t3_fyznbz,1586594920.0,"First of all, your friend is well meaning but wrong. There are many compassionate therapists out there enthusiastic about the uniqueness of working with BPD. If you suspect you have it, research therapists in your area who work with personality disorders. They should be able to diagnose you within a few sessions. 

I think you know that you do have at least some BPD traits. If budget is an issue, you can take matters into your own hands by researching DBT skills. Of course, DBT is intended for a therapy setting but many of the concepts are easy to grasp without a professional. That way you can hit the ground running when you’re in the financial position to start therapy."

The reason we were asked not to is because it’s wrong to be given credit for the same work twice which I agree with.

It just so happens that this thing is going to be circulated on the internet, so ethically I see it as a grey area. 

I will ask my tutor about it."

I believe I have a mostly “male” brain. However, the physiology and function of our brains is shaped by our experiences in life. Having been raised a girl, there are social imprints in my brain that I’ll never be able to rid myself of. Of course, some people have binary identities despite their socialization.

The Maxims should be obeyed, and if they are violated the results are free humorous or annoying. The four Maxims are:

1. Quantity-Be as informative as you can. Give as much information as is needed and no more. This is why “Cesar died a long time ago” is appropriate while “Cesar died over 70 years ago” is not.

2. Quality-be truthful. Violation: sarcasm. Why is it called a Cesar salad?” “WeLl it Couldn’t PoSSibLy be because it was named after a guy named Cesar”

3. Relevance-Give information that is pertinent. Violation: “why is it called a Cesar salad?” “Today I bought six eggs”.

4. Manner- be brief, clear and avoid obscurities or ambiguities.this overlaps a fair bit with quantity and also applies to the meme seen here. Violation: “you mean to tell me that Julius Cesar, who is dead, made this salad?” Is a joke, however “Julius Cesar, who has been dead over 70 years, made this salad?” Adds an odd piece of information and becomes brain-hurting-funny.

Intentional manipulation of these maxims is called “flouting”"
