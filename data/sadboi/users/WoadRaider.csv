CasualConversation,eynutbd,t3_cxtari,1567262557.0,"Great work and it is easier to quit sooner than later. I've been going on over a month now since I quit tobacco. I've relapsed once when I found an old cigarette but otherwise I've been doing well on avoiding all of that. 

I quit cannabis about a month before that and I haven't slipped up once on that habit. I'm most proud of stopping that drug.

My current goal is to slowly cut most of alcohol and then perhaps caffeine out of my life since those are my last two crutches. I drink coffee every day and I drink beer/liquor at least a couple times a week. I don't consider either of these as detrimental as my other habits I've quit but I would still like to be the master of my mind and be able to choose when or how I partake and not feel like its a necessary part of my daily/weekly routine. 

Anyways, its all about willpower and finding ways to replace old habits with new ones. Best of luck to us both!"
