It's so mysterious and dramatic in a way because people will think it's so weird and probably will gossip about where you are actually going.

I kinda like the drama and weirdness of it though. It almost reminds me of a movie or something. I feel like saying something along the lines of ""I am taking some time off to focus on some of my own projects, family, etc"" would be a lot less mysterious and is not a lie."

So in high school I was in a class where we had to take turns reading a book out loud. I am white and during my turn I had to read a passage with the n-word in it. This was in a room full of black students.  When I got to that word I stopped and all of the black students were cracking up at the awkwardness. The teacher told me that it was okay to read it in the context of a book since it is not hateful. You are reading a book to get an idea of the context of the times. I feel like singing a song is similar. She didn't call anyone that. She actually was appreciating black music and imitating black culture."

Plus I cook most of my meals at home because I can control the ingredients and make it healthier and cheaper than if I ate out. I feel like bread is not that healthy for you either way so its not as worth it to me to put the extra effort in.

It helps to get you in the right mindset of working. It also helps to have a dedicated space in your house to work so you associate that spot with working. It also helps to schedule your day just as you would at work. Break down what you need to accomplish into small tasks and schedule them on your calendar and try to stick to that schedule. It is really easy to have no structure at home so you have to create your own structure so you can get shit done. Look into the pomodoro method too.

But for reals though, I agree with others that if your productivity is lower during this crisis then it is not the end of the world.

It's probably scary putting yourself out there for all to see and judge especially when a lot of people do get villainized on The Bachelor.

I kind of thought maybe that is why Peter wasn't as into HA. She just seemed so helplessly in love with him without really ever showing us her perspective on life. All we really got was that she loved him so much and that she is a nice person. Even with Kelley who wanted it to be easy between the two of them showed us that she had that perspective (that it could be easy and she wanted to have a good time even if she is not picked)."

GradSchool,fjq575d,t3_fef9iu,1583567792.0,"Yes! My thesis lab was extremely cliquey and they would do the same type of things to me. I struggled with it so much and it really pushed me into some sort of depression. I had to get therapy because it really hurt my self esteem. I went from being bubbly and outgoing to being withdrawn and quiet and suffering.

I ended up staying in the lab and basically waiting for them to leave. Still though, I felt their gossip about me permeated to even the new people in the lab. So I was basically miserable in that lab for all of grad school. The one saving grace is that my PI was actually a nice person who I got along with so I got lucky with that. I also found one nice person in the lab who took me under their wing and tried to help me and mentor me. I eventually graduated but it was a really hard time in my life.

One thing that helped me get through the BS was to invest in a pair of good headphones and wear them anytime I was in lab. It helped to tune them out and finally have the attitude of not even wanting to try with them. If I could do something differently, I probably would have reached out more to the other people in lab who were not really in the clique. I also would have confronted each of them one on one and asked them directly if I did something to upset them. It took me a lot of therapy to realize that there are ways to stand up for yourself while still being professional."
