alcoholism,fdhkbm2,t1_f6krq3w,1578424466.0,Okay so i was reading through my past posts and figured i would write an update. Turns out he was over medicating. Since his stroke he has a bad short term memory. And his dr prescribed him sleeping pills. So he would take his medicine and a couple hours later he couldn’t remember if he took it or not and take it again: so that’s what the problem was: he moved in with my aunt Donna for about two weeks and she got his medicine organized in a pill organizer and he’s all good. Checked his esophagus for enlarged veins or something and that was all good. 😊
Anxiety,f9q1qv2,t1_f9nwvzw,1575553568.0,I hate going to the er cause the moment they see you’re on anxiety medications it’s like everything is downhill from there. Automatically think you’re crazy and say it’s anxiety . And don’t take anything you say seriously
alcoholism,f6qwsqz,t3_dsod5e,1573087949.0,Congratulations! You should be so proud of yourself . Keep going ! 😊🥳
alcoholism,f6mtjc4,t3_drrpd0,1572978604.0,Thank you so much 😊
alcoholism,f6mmscc,t1_f6mi6l1,1572975404.0,"Yea. It obviously doesn’t help he’s not eating. And when i talk to him it’s like he’s out of breath. I was reading some stuff online and it was talking about with what he may possibly have going on is that his brain is so scrambled that it’s forgetting to tell his body it’s hungry, and to breathe. And last night he said his legs feel like they aren’t working. So it’s like his brain isn’t telling his legs to walk when he wants to. I mentioned going to the dr and he freaked out. It doesn’t help he has said multiple times he doesn’t want to live any longer. Ever since his mom passed away years ago, and his close brother passed away about 5 years ago he doesn’t have any will to live. I dunno. I just don’t even know. All i know to do is pray and ask for advice !"
alcoholism,f6ksjzg,t1_f6krq3w,1572919674.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to my post. It means a lot. Truly.
Anxiety,f2o0vlj,t3_dduir3,1570321795.0,Just crazy. Why can’t i be normal lol
Anxiety,f2o0ha1,t3_dduir3,1570321653.0,Man.. my jaw was actually  clenched! Gives me awful headaches. Then anxiety kicks in and i think i have a brain tumor. Anxiety sucks! Thank you for this !
Anxiety,f1qyigh,t3_dagatd,1569708553.0,"I’ve tried a lot of medicines. Celexa, Ativan, and so forth. What’s worked for me is 350mg of Wellbutrin and Prozac together . I was prescribed buspar in addition to those but i don’t wanna be on another medicine. Let us know how it turns out ."
Anxiety,f1qy7ly,t3_daj53z,1569708409.0,I have a permanently enlarged lymph node. I’ve had it for about 8 years now. It’s about the size of an almond and i can always feel it . My doctor says it’s normal.
Anxiety,f1qxzn9,t3_daiuh7,1569708308.0,I have to have a fan on and the tv. I absolutely cannot fall asleep without the tv. If it’s off i will wake up and have to turn it back on. Crazy.
Anxiety,f0nlmw9,t3_d5kdwg,1568773366.0,I’m trying to figure out why she didn’t pay for the difference. Not to hurry you up or be all high and mighty of her but i mean.. there’s no way i could stand there and watch someone crumble like you were. I’ve been there before and it is awful. I literally go to the same place in Walmart at the end of my grocery trip ( in the bread section beside the five million types of dinner rolls lol) and i add up all of my stuff. If my bill is close to $300 i will bring $400 just in case because I’m so scared of doing the math wrong and going over . Like my calculator will say $305 after tax and i still tell my husband I’m going to bring $400 just in case! I don’t use a card because i have been in numerous situations where I’ve had money in the bank and my card get declined because my bank sucks and is always having issues ! But I’m sorry you had to deal with that. I’ve been there . I’m glad you made it through!🤓
Anxiety,f0byceh,t1_f0aoxoa,1568533384.0,"Oh no i agree with googling about anxiety. I’m talking about like when you have a pain somewhere like googling headache and brain tumor pops up . Stuff like that.  But that’s just me , it may be different for some people ."
Anxiety,f0aj7o9,t3_d2j1xs,1568515374.0,"Only time i do this is when I’m at the mall and trying to avoid those kiosks with folks trying to sell flat irons, Dead Sea skin masks and knockoff sunglasses lol"
Anxiety,f0a1t3d,t1_f0a1pb8,1568509649.0,Oh and DO NOT GOOGLE 🥴
Anxiety,f0a1pb8,t3_d4cojm,1568509614.0,"Okay. This is a very tough anxiety. I have this and i have for the passed.... 11 years i believe. I completely understand. A chest pain is a heart attack when it’s usually anxiety... or acid reflux. A lump in a breast is automatically breast cancer not just dense breast tissue, a headache is a brain tumor. Trust me i get it. And you go to the dr and get told you’re not dying from a disease or whatever you think you have and all is right in the world again . I’ve thought I had aids ( even though it was completely irrational) ,breast cancer, melanoma, brain tumors, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, bone cancer, pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer... i mean i could go on and on. I’ve had countless CAT scans, bloodwork, ultrasounds and so
Forth. All of that worrying changes nothing as far as the outcome of your life and what’s going to happen. I know you’ve heard that a million times but you have got to believe it. I don’t know if you’re a religious
Person but that’s what helps me and always has. If God brings me to it he will help me through it. And you’ve got to have the “ I’ll beat it anyways” attitude. I always tell myself when i think i have whatever disease it is ... “ well even if you do have this are you going to succumb to the disease and just let it beat you or are you going to do what you can to fight it and not let it win or at least go down with a fight!!” . That helps me a lot. Like ok i recently thought sorta currently think i have a brain tumor. I say sorta because i know i don’t.. but the anxiety is still there. Because even though i have been to two doctors and have been told i do not... the anxiety doesn’t just go away. It has consumed me and that doesn’t  just go away over night. It slowly drifts away out of your mind till you forget: that’s how it is for me anyways.  But it’s miserable i know.. and you have just got to find what works for you as far as coping. I do take medication for it ... and it helps me . That and what I’ve mentioned above. It gets lonely. And no one understands unless they go through it themselves and that’s ok. I mean you can’t blame people for not understanding because it’s not their fault. But anyways. I hope this has helped you. It will be okay i promise. You got this !"

anxietysupporters,f01oddi,t3_d1jj3k,1568317030.0,Thank you so much for answering my question ☺️
Anxiety,ezy7tzq,t3_d31svh,1568260426.0,"I honestly think it’s just how things are with depression. I have been depressed only a couple of times now. There’s a difference in being down and out versus depressed. Someone who hasn’t ever been depressed will never understand. Don’t get upset about being down again. It will pass . Just try to get back to the mind frame you were in when you wasn’t depressed and try and remember what you did differently. I know you don’t choose to be depressed.. it just happens. And i know when you’re not depressed .. you probably get anxious wondering “ omg when is it
Going to hit again... can i truly be happy or
Is it a matter of time before i get depressed again..”. It’s all going to be okay. Just breathe... and pray. That’s what helps me . And i try and keep myself occupied. 🙃"
Anxiety,ezy7dgp,t3_d2uvhw,1568260000.0,"I’m 29. I’ve had anxiety most of my life. Mainly from my home life as a child and always being the least important in everyone’s lives. So on and so forth. Really can take a toll on your self worth. I mainly have health anxiety. I think it’s a lot of me trying to figure out what’s wrong with me that made my mom not want me blah blah blah. Sounds crazy but it makes sense to me. Anyways! I honestly don’t think someone shouldn’t have a family , or a relationship in general , due to anxiety. In my opinion having someone around that cares about you helps a whole lot. I’ve been married a little over 10 years and it really helps not being alone. He doesn’t quite understand due to his upbringing being relatively normal but it’s good to have someone to talk to about it and be close to ya know. That’s just my opinion though. And medication, for me, has worked out a lot. Just have to find out what works for you. And staying busy busy busy. Good luck . It will get better. 😊"
