Last season we had 10 players with more than 40 points (Donskoi had 37), and this year, we probably would have had 7.  Also, Burnzie had a Norris Caliber season and we didn't have Hurtle for half the year.  That alone is ~70, factor in the loss of 40 points producers, we probably lost about 2 goals per game on average.  By my count, that would've gotten us at least a point in 18 games...
