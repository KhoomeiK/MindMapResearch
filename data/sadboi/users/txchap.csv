Look at previous outbreaks (ebola, SARS, H1N1, etc).  Those are ones that we could have caught, but did not since the outbreak was contained.  If we can continue to social distance, wear masks, wash hands, etc, our hope is we keep the numbers down in SA and therefore, our chance of running into someone who has it and spreads it to us is less.  Then we keep doing that until a vaccine is ready and we are golden!  Could be wishful thinking.....I know.  But at least it's possible!"

 *According to the log, the San Antonio Police Department responded to a second call at the sports bar on May 5. Officers found about 50 people, including employees, inside the ""crowded"" bar. The log says no one, including the owner, was wearing a face covering or practicing social distancing. The bar was selling alcohol and none of the patrons were seen eating food.*

Anxiety,fkuizae,t3_fkq88w,1584550294.0,"I think alot of us are in this same line of thinking.

When my mind starts going crazy and worry about the future, I try to remind myself that too much anxiety can actually bring down your immune system, and no one wants that now.  So concentrate on what you are facing TODAY:  if you need food, go get it.  If you need supplies, search for them.  Don't spend too much time thinking about what's coming next because we don't know.

hospice,f5wyq9n,t3_dpdqiu,1572532722.0,"My father passed in June of this year and was on Hospice for about 3 weeks before he passed.  Looking back, I think I was in denial that the end was near and didn't even think Hospice was needed at the time, but agreed as it would have given him some additional one on one attention (outside of the standard nursing home staff).  On the day he passed, my wife and I stopped by to visit him and I immediately knew there was an issue based on how he was breathing.  I call it 'fish breathing' as it kind of looks like a fish gulping for air out of water, but he was showing no signs of stress or discomfort.  I still did not think that it was time.  My wife leaned over him and whispered in his ear that it was ok to go and he had family waiting for him.  It probably was not more than 5 minutes later that he opened his eyes wide and then took his last breath.  It was that peaceful.  Literally like the power to a machine had been unplugged.  Breath, eyes open and then nothing.  I think there was a single breath a few minutes later, but most likely involuntary body movement.  It was the most peaceful thing I have seen and still amazes me to this day how it progressed.

Looking back, it appears that he was in the 'active dying' state for probably a week prior to his passing, but did not realize it at the time.  Hospice did see him daily and we were talking about options, but you never really know when the time is coming.  Each person is different.

If someone is part time and only works 20 hours per week, then in theory they have earned 34.66 hours of sick leave (20 hours per week x 52 weeks = 1,040 hours / 30).  But would that person receive the automatic 56 hour minimum?"

sanantonio,exto4qh,t1_extjizy,1566572091.0,Are you happy with Spectrum gigabit?  How is the reliability of service (ie outages)?  Is it worth the cost?
sanantonio,exexvdh,t1_exdqvjj,1566227986.0,"Food is expensive and in my opinion is average.  Nothing great; your really paying for the experience and atmosphere rather than the food.

Also, keep in mind the time of day you plan on going.  In late afternoon, it can get quite hot near the windows with that sun beating in.  We went one year in full formal dress and I about died from the direct sunlight while sitting at the table."
sanantonio,exexftl,t3_cs98tt,1566227686.0,"I have lived here for over 20 years and in my opinion, SA has not done a great job on improving infrastructure to keep pace with the increasing population.  Sure there have been some improvements:  281&1604 as well as some expansion of 1604 around Seaworld, but not enough to make a big difference in the amount of traffic that builds daily.  1604 has been two lanes for decades and unless something is done soon, we are going to be dealing with rush hour type commutes during all hours of the day."

hospice,et7q85r,t3_caabku,1562535839.0,"My father passed away a few weeks ago and was on hospice for the last few weeks of his life.  He was on a peg tube for years and the last few days, the feeding was backing up through the tube.  What I thought might had been a physical problem with the tube was in fact his body refusing the liquids.  I, too, worried about starving him to death, but that was not the case.  As others have said, as the body shuts down, the digestive system is one that slows or stops.  Our hospice reps were great in giving us options on how best to deal with each situation as it came about, so I would discuss with them on what's best for your mom's comfort."
