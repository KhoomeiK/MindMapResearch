depression_help,fkvm3e6,t1_fkvjgm1,1584572010.0,"I guess I should have taken that into consideration too, but a program is just an outline. You need to take it and shape it as needed. YouTube is great for looking up roadblock solutions when working out as well. Let's say a program's says you should be doing 20lbs on this workout for a week and then 25lbs the next week. If you can't do the 25, no worries! Just go back to the 20lbs until that feels very easy for you. Sure you may not be finished in the time the program says, but that doesn't matter. It's your own personal journey. Expectations are goals to strive for, if you fail at meeting those, it's not a bad thing! That only means you tried, and trying is more than most will ever do."
depression_help,fkvek4s,t1_fkvdq0n,1584567621.0,"You can never measure your progress by others in any aspect of life and weight lifting or working out in general is a huge one. Set small goals. Work on going up 5lbs per week on each workout. It's super slow, no matter who you are. Some people just have the right genetics and others have to work harder. Even if workouts aren't your key to finding the light in the darkness, I hope you find your light and can always accept the small victories."

Heâ€™d be damned if any slopes were gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boyâ€™s birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.
