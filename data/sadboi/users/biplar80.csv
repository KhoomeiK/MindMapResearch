BipolarReddit,ffmckgj,t3_eu4rof,1580052382.0,I rapid cycle so much it can be daily or weekly monthly yearly at times. I can not survive without meds. Yes i rapid cycle on meds but not to the severity. Bren medicated since 95 at age 15.
BipolarReddit,ffmbycl,t3_eu4sk3,1580052087.0,Caffeine and cigarettes my 2 favorite things cause me severe anxiety only took me 21 years  of panic disorder to truly realize this dammit!
BipolarReddit,ffmbijw,t3_eu4udn,1580051869.0,Had to get off it cause resting heart rate was 30 instead of 60 to 80 after 3 months of use. Worked great though
mentalhealth,ffm8aq1,t3_eu3px5,1580050187.0,"No resort life style in public mental hospitals but safe. Think of it as a vacation from life. But everything is usually a pink and what i call institutional green or mint color. I can't handle that color when I'm not in the psych ward it freaks me out! We had no groups but did have activities. No phones, movie at night for 2 hours, no smoking, no computers, hence no wifi. See the doctor for 15 min 1 time a day. 3 meals and a snack. Just anxious boredom i call it. But that is here in Tucson, Arizona. You can make great friends though cause your all there for help. And meet people with the same disorder! LOL! most of all you are in a safe environment. Bring a book or coloring stuff and clothes. Shoes without laces. You'll have lots of stories to tell friends and family  or what i did write chapters to a biography on your experience. Really not as bad as it sounds."
mentalhealth,ffm6x0k,t3_eu3rhj,1580049581.0,"I had this for 20 years due to med fog but what helped and i hate to admit?......
NO SUGAR AND FEW CARBS. I do keto diet and brain fog went from really bad to just like 2 times a day instead of all damn day. I never believed food would be a culprit and would deny it for a long time but because of chronic pain all my life i was put on keto and pain and dog dissipated. Never would i put my money on that till i actually saw results after a month. Good luck!"
mentalhealth,ffm6jpt,t3_eu35mn,1580049291.0,"Go to NAMI.ORG and look for your local one. They have groups and stuff to join for free often or at least resources to help you. I've been in therapy for 35 years and it never did a thing. Then I found EMDR therapy and it saved my life! Total different kind of trauma therapy. Read up on it. I've been hospitalized multiple times, every med they make for bipolar And every treatment practically since put on meds in 95. EmDR did the most and i do ketamime (special k on the streets, animal tranquilizer and burn victim sedative) treatments have practically cured my panic disorder and bipolar medicine resistant depression and suicidal ideation. For 2 years now. Good luck!"
mentalhealth,ffm3hsn,t3_eu5lp3,1580047904.0,"All i can say is, you had a breakthrough! I've had panic disorder since 98 and no anxiety meds for 5 years and would kill to have what you've experienced!"
mentalhealth,ffm39bd,t3_eu5p75,1580047760.0,"You have no control over mom. None of this is yours or your siblings fault either. Just know this. If your mom decides to give up, then it is her decision to make and no one else's. Be there for your dad and sisters. And make sure you get help hopefully you can find a good therapist. I say that everyone needs a therapist regardless how perfect they believe their life is. Trauma comes in many forms and we don't recognize what is truly traumatic till it is pointed out to us that hey, that isn't ""normal"". And also remember that it is ok not to be ok. Shit happens. I've bren been diagnosed and on meds since 95 and in therapy since 83. You can do this! Sending light, love, and healing!"

BipolarReddit,eyz892t,t3_czli4f,1567611838.0,I agree. I have told my partner i need more physical attention and one on one time recently.  But i think i need to reiterate that again.
BipolarReddit,eyz7nv3,t1_eyz4o2k,1567611453.0,Thank you so much for this. I have cheated in practical every relationship. I have been so damn good this time. I will put on the breaks and step back. Again thank you!
mentalhealth,eyer35f,t3_cwr8pc,1567037782.0,I enjoyed this piece.
AmItheAsshole,eyepnwv,t3_cwiokz,1567037173.0,So heres what ive done since 1995 at 15 to now at 39. When people ask about me. I tell them im on disability for mental illness tight away. I explain my many illnesses and my many accomplishments I've made in the mental health field along with my 6 year agoraphobia and resistant depression. And my 10 years of mania from 15 to 25. If they are off put. I change the subject. Usually people start pouring out about their life or family members. Honestly have only been stigmatized once that i know of. Take me as i am or dont waste yours or my time and get attached. Now you know what your stepping into and can never say i never told you so. Also i have never lost a friend to my mental health but have left a few for refusing help with their's.
mentalhealth,eyajcrc,t3_cwfbmr,1566964223.0,Thats panic. Ive had it since 98. I get the feeling of a heart attack though. Definently impending doom or death thoughts. Been in the hospital many times over nothing. Ive been off valium after 16 years for 5 years cause it causes Alzheimer's so better to fight it with therapy and cbt or dbt. I found emdr therapy really helped mine quickly and i do ketamine treatments too but they are super expensive and every 6 to 8 weeks.
