BPD,fnxdujz,t1_fnw85si,1587336618.0,"Oh I like this one. 

Before I was diagnosed or knew I had BPD I described myself as having ""emotional IBS"" - either everything's all clammed up or everything is coming out, both situations are painful, and in both cases I have to think about what I've consumed in the last few hours to days to trigger it."
BPD,fniz96e,t1_fni1ck7,1586989030.0,"I second this. It was actually suggested TO me by the therapist because I couldn't remember mood changes or their cause, and I certainly couldn't talk about it.

Showing/reading the journal felt really cringey because I would always have the mask up during sessions and couldn't recognise the ""me"" from yesterday who wrote those things. If I did remember, I downplayed the events because they seemed trivial or ridiculous after the fact. That journal helped me confront a lot of things and eventually helped me get diagnosed."
BPD,fl8plir,t3_fn8c7s,1584929203.0,"I feel like sometimes I'm a strict parent trying to take care of a demonic toddler or teenager I don't even like. I'm constantly yelling at self to eat my food, not cry in public, go to sleep, don't put that thing in your mouth etc"

I'm trying to look on the bright side - at least I have access to toilet paper and pasta now"
OCD,fkovvmb,t1_fkn9nkc,1584396168.0,"Just a bit of satire at people who 'gatekeep' things that are popular - for example people who say ""ergh all these chicks now cosplaying Harley Quinn probably haven't even read the comics"", or those who demand that people wearing band T-shirts name the month, day, and phase of the moon when each single was released and call them 'fake fans' if they can't etc."
OCD,fkmu14h,t3_fjdtob,1584340038.0,"As a kid (well, and now), pencils were a trigger for my contamination OCD. That combined with perfectionism took drawing away from me, which was something I had loved.

I've recently started to get back into it, and I've been able to do so by only drawing in pen to hack my brain. I'll set myself a small time limit and try to draw a single object. If I think I've fucked up a line with my pen, just gotta keep going and work around it. I usually still end up happy enough with the final product and am pleasantly surprised, rather than frustrated."

BPD,f80sbo5,t1_f80s0r4,1574136948.0,"I've also found it helpful in other ways though. At uni I would test my understanding of a topic by ""explaining"" it to someone else in my head. The other person would interrupt with seemingly simple questions that can totally throw you off if you don't fundamentally understand the topic.

The side effect is that if someone does ask me about one of these subjects in real life I have an already prepared 1-hour lecture that they probably weren't anticipating :)"
BPD,f80s0r4,t3_dy13tj,1574136710.0,"I've had to tell my therapist that sometimes if I don't tell him something it's simply because I've already had the conversation in my head and either forgot it wasn't real or can't be bothered to ""discuss"" it again."
BPD,f80rupq,t1_f805i1a,1574136577.0,"One of the reasons it took me a while to realise how severe and frequent my moods swings are is because I was using a daily mood tracker (for depression) and wasn't very diligent so it always averaged out to ""meh"". It was only when a new therapist said ""write down EVERY mood change and trigger"" that we figured out I have BPD."

My default coping mode is ""detached"" so sometimes I even hide it FROM MYSELF, which just leads to a permanent state of confusion and emotional constipation (intense discomfort, but nothing will come out)."
