For me the changes come through a combo of therapy and medication. I’ve done group therapy during periods where I really struggled. I see a therapist and a psychiatrist. I have worked to cultivate practices that help me get through stuff. It’s a process, but I’d rather work to move forward than work to stand still."

One thing to keep in mind is that working on your own mental health is a constant improvement. The first therapist, doctor, medication are not going to be perfect. It takes time and effort to really dig into find what works for an individual 

The hardest thing for me to understand is that I have to be my biggest advocate. If something is not working then I need to speak up to find a change. If a med is not working well for you, tell your doctor. If your doctor won’t change medications then get a new doctor. 

Good luck"

Sounds like he needs help ASAP. Not for intrusive thoughts but to help establish a reality base line. 

If he is in a state of constantly questioning himself and worries that treatment will be worse than his reality is now then he needs to talk to someone who understands what he is going through and how to help him get through it. 

Please encourage him to get treatment, counseling, anything to address issues he clearly has with himself."
