relationship_advice,fqfrg4g,t1_fqfqnff,1589330245.0,"You could start by approaching him with ‚ÄúI feel insecure about some things and I want to work them out.  I want to work them out with you if that‚Äôs ok?   A lot of this is because of what‚Äôs happened to me in the past.  So if I see things that look similar to that, I‚Äôm having a hard time getting past it.‚Äù 

That way there‚Äôs no direct blame to him and he‚Äôll probably feel less ‚Äúattacked‚Äù.   If he gets defensive or attacks you (verbally I would assume) or redirects it, then there‚Äôs your answer.  Time to move on.  He may be open to better communication, but if he does that, then it‚Äôs not the time for him.  Doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt the time for you.

You need to have someone by your side that helps you through your issues and such.  Not pad, ignore, or enjoy them.  (Not saying he‚Äôs doing all three).  I‚Äôm not sure how much chance you have, but if it‚Äôs not supportive on BOTH sides, the chances aren‚Äôt high."

Leave.  Let that relationship go.  It‚Äôll suck initially, but if it‚Äôs on your own terms in taking a stand for yourself, you‚Äôll heal much faster.

It also wouldn‚Äôt hurt to seek therapy.  If not, those kinds of guys will be hard to avoid."
