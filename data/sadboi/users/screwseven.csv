I think you should look around and see if you can find a place that accepts your insurance and/or that you can pay for. Can I ask, are you in the US?

Edit: there are way more means of therapy than what I mentioned, groups, medication (sometimes that's needed, but do your research and really talk to the psychiatrist), lots of other stuff, it's not JUST a vacation"
