I had very little food for about a week. Breakfasts would be a boiled egg with some cucumber, chicken fillets for lunch, salad for dinner, etc., you get the point. I noticed my brain fog improved noticeably. 

My theories are:

1. Food sensitivity to certain foods - grains, gluten, dairy ?

2. Insulin response, I usually love bread, pizza, pasta, etc., which are known to spike the insulin release in the system. Insulin is known to make us sleepy, feel sedated. 

Why don't you try a water fast for 36 hours, and see what it does to hour mind? I've done it multiple times, and it does something very interesting to the main, it clears it. Perhaps our bodies would do best with keto diet? i don't know.

Also, for some reason fish oil clears my head. And you have to excercise, raising your pulse feels like having a panic attack, but it's long term effects on the anxiety levels are invaluable. 

Also DO NOT take anything that have even the slightest amounts of caffeine. I can't stress this enough."

I blended around 160g of pitted dates with a bit of water to a runny paste. This will 'bond' the rest of the ingredients together. Then add:
- around 150g of whatever protein powder you have
- raw pumpkin seeds
- raw sunflower seeds
- desiccated coconut or coconut flakes 
- some vanilla (seeds, liquid, etc will do)
- raw nuts
- maca powder
- oats

Make the whole thing into a hardish dough, and flatten with a glass bottle / wooden thingy. 

Basically, the base is dates and protein powder, then add whatever you like

At the end melt some dark chocolate (80%+) cover, and pop in the fridge.

Definitely healthier than protein bars in stores."
