IAmA,fqrh4dc,t3_gk7y2p,1589584243.0,Any special mindfulness tips for those of us struggling with depersonalisation/derealisation? Ever since quarantine started I can’t even take out the trash without having a massive panic attack.
Anxiety,foqjlly,t3_g8v0l8,1587995027.0,yes yes yes and yes again i really hate the thought of having to go back to school once this is all over as being there makes my anxiety go through the roof.
AskMen,fnnda89,t3_g2nj43,1587089738.0,honestly im female and i prefer guys that dress well and that are in touch with their feminine side over guys that act in the same brutalist and macho way so just do you

In my experience we get along ok at first but they have huge egos and can’t stand anyone making jokes about them. One of the ESTPs I know flat out told me that he feels like he has to be the best at everything and that everyone has to admire him, he just can’t fathom that not being his reality. Healthy ESTPs seem really fun to be around and I’m sure I could have a “partner in crime” type of bond with them like I do with ISTPs."
