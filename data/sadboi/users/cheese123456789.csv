Is it not possible this individual has 2 set ups? Say a home and a work set up? 
I guess I'd need more evidence before I condemn this person for passing off other set ups as their own, unless of course there are/were more pictures I'm unable to see right now."

Would you not agree that someone who struggles through a hardship and bears the burden, not even necessarily over comes it, is stronger for this? A man who leaves his house with tears in his eyes from abuse is surely in some way exerting more strength than the man who leaves his house at peace with the world? Does that make sense?"
mentalhealth,fhd022m,t3_f2jrg7,1581474461.0,"It sounds like for you the depression, like mine, is just an imbalance in the brain, try anti depressants and if they don't work duet and exercise is the only thing left. You have an unfair fight on your hands and it's ok if you want to give up but try look at it like this: if you drink too much and have a hangover you wait for it to pass, it can be shit but you wait it out. Your mental health is no different, you need to wait it out and let the sadness pass, it's no different to any other temporary drop in quality of life except for one area, it will turn your thoughts against you. If you ever need to talk message me on Reddit and I'll happily listen and talk it out with you any time of the day. It's ok to feel like you can't carry this burden, no one feels like they can fight their way out of it when they feel it. That's the hard part I guess, people who cope better with it don't have some secret answer to it all, because you're not wrong if you say it's too much to deal with. I don't know mate sorry for the essay :)"

AskReddit,fb98efj,t3_ebzamg,1576632025.0,"Sex is an exploration of the pleasure you both experience, but it needs to be an exploration of what you both want.
When I want to find something I express what it is I desire to seek out and hope I find direction from others and I try to enjoy that journey. It doesn't need words necessarily, but like two people finding something hidden together, work at the same goal. Don't just turn up and expect the situation alone to yield results. You get out what you get in.
Also don't do something someone else loves expecting everyone else to love it, I'm not a fan of the finger up the arse, even if John loves it.

depression,exrhbjl,t3_ctxsee,1566516710.0,"You know, I feel the same way. Depression ground me down and I couldn't see a way out, it made me feel nothing was going to help me get back to ""normal"", and I thought to myself if depression were a person that I would ask ""why?"". Before I continue I want to say I'm not a violent or angry or aggressive individual, I despise resorting to aggression as it shows a lack of ability or willingness to reason. But I thought if depression were a person, stood there every day trying to grind me down I wouldn't ask them why at all. I'd fight back. Depression is a physical disability, there is a prevailing theory that we lack the required elements of a synapse to receive neurotransmitters and this effects our ability to regulate our mood or emotions. So it's a thing, a tangible discoverable thing, not some boogey man in the clouds that saps our energy and will to feel joy. It does do those things but we can focus on it and get pissed off. Feel anger, determination and fatigue. The kind of fatigue where you feel a hail Mary or some last attempt is worth it before you lose your energy. It's easier said than done and depression is more of a long distance run than a sprint, but if you feel yourself wondering if you can hack feeling like this anymore, then try a little rage. Like alcohol or drugs it's not really sustainable, but I have found it helped me. It threatened my relationship and if anyone had threatened it the way my mental health did I would handle that situation with reason and determination, I tried this with expression and it gave me the get up and go to jump on a read mill and go to work. And dare to dream I could live under a grey cloud and smile. Sorry if this doesn't help, I hope you all the best. Once depression backs you into a corner, viewing it from another angle sometimes helps. Sorry for the war and peace :)"

Modern titles at max graphics I get 90-100 FPS with demanding titles like AC origins and odyssey, but stuff like overwatch is straight balls to the wall max everything and easy get 144 FPS."
