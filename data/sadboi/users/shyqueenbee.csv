I have personally used the Stop, Breathe, & Think app every for over two years and I love it, so I said I wanted to do the meditation at the meeting; however my ASM told me that no other groups did it lol. Maybe whoever runs your meeting will let you guys skip it if it makes you uncomfortable."

exjw,fpry3zc,t3_gf216l,1588864214.0,"Thankfully, my parents had a *slightly* more tempered view of this — my dad would always say that any accomplishment was thanks to preparation, skill, and J/holy spirit. (He said it in percentages, but I don’t remember them; suffice it to say that J took most of the credit.)

To be fair, he didn’t just apply it me, he also used this line when others would praise him for things like running a smooth convention, giving a great talk, etc. I always found it weird because he truly viewed himself as a “good for nothing slave” that owed everything to the big J, even though I consistently saw him working hard and felt he deserved credit for that hard work. 

This type of attitude is definitely in the guise of not encouraging arrogance, but rather than being humbling in a healthy way it ends up eroding self-worth and confidence. And I have to say that, objectively, it hurts your interactions in the real world because someone who is constantly self-deprecating isn’t often successful or viewed as capable... even if they *are* capable and are just conditioned to act like they don’t know their worth.

Also, working through underlying problems with a therapist has been absolutely invaluable. Mine has encouraged me to engage in healthier coping skills (meditation/yoga, exercise, hobbies, etc.) Video games and crocheting/knitting are great for keeping hands busy!

If I’m feeling really worried that I’ll do it, I go sit in the closet — it makes me feel safe, for some reason, and I’m away from anything I’d use to harm myself.

That aside, I’ve found myself frustrated by “outsiders” being sympathetic to JWs before; it’s really hard not to jump down their throats and aggressively let them know that it’s a cult, that it’s destroyed people’s lives, that it’s the reason my family acts like I died, all that stuff. But they honestly don’t know any better. I’ve gotten a lot better results when I’m able to stay calm and explain maybe one or two things. (Though tbh, I usually can’t bring myself to say much because I become anxious and panicky.)

Within a romantic relationship dynamic, I’m afraid I don’t really have any advice, just some sympathy. My SO, upon finding out what high-control religious group I was raised in, did his own research without telling me. He’d gone to high school with a JW and didn’t have any strong feelings about the religion, but he took the time to look into things for himself and he’s been incredibly supportive and understanding. Now it’s been years since I was disfellowshipped, and he still listens to me rant, is sensitive to TV/movies that might trigger me, etc. So I guess my only suggestion is to have your partner look into things themselves — then maybe they’ll better understand the scope of the effect this traumatic experience had on you."

For example, I get “good girl spanks” after pretty much any sexual encounter, I get to wear my collar almost any time I ask for it, that sort of thing. 

However, we don’t often plan out scenes unless we are trying something new. We just kind of... do what we feel like doing and trust our safeword system and each other.

And now I’m disfellowshipped, divorced, living across the country, and am back in school for the first time in ten years. But the only thing I regret is letting social and familial pressure get to me, letting the organization rob me of so many years. Don’t let them waste your life either. 

If you have to, use the excuse that they always need nurses at bethel, that it’s a good job that can support a pioneering schedule (I knew a lot of RNs who were also pioneers), and it’s a field that has great job security.

It sounds like she’s into degradation, and as someone who really enjoys it, it can be a lot of fun! But there definitely needs to be a non-sexual discussion (i.e., outside the bedroom) about it. There may be lines you don’t feel comfortable crossing (like talking about her having sex with other men) as well as lines she wouldn’t want to cross (e.g., being called a cum dump, etc.)

Personally, I would take her comments about you satisfying her so well that she doesn’t need to have sex with other guys with more than a grain of salt. It seems to me that she’s not saying that she actually *is* having sex with others, she’s just saying something that plays into her fantasy.

But as a teenager, I spent a lot of time “taking notes” and “preparing my comments” for whatever part was coming up."

But just fyi, if you’re in the US, that name embroidery is not to standard — it needs to be in the top left corner of the apron where a name tag would be placed. You may be able to get away with it depending on your managerial team (SM & DM), but the rules are pretty stringent as far as placement, size, and even font. I believe the info is in the partner handbook if you wanted to look into it!"

MealPrepSunday,fikjc1v,t1_fikdthq,1582481437.0,"I like to do something similar and start with hashbrowns at the bottom, and then sprinkle shredded Colby jack and crumbled/diced bacon as the next layer, topping it off with eggs. I usually use the ratio of one egg for every mini loaf, whisk them all together with a splash of milk and salt/pepper/Mrs. Dash, and then portion them out between the loaves. 

But most of the time I’ll prep the same thing in individual glass containers (~1 cup each) and leave it unbaked for my boyfriend to have for breakfast; all he has to do is microwave it for a minute or two to cook the egg and he’s all set! Really nice for busy mornings, and tastes a little better as he’s not a fan of reheated eggs :)"

I usually just pull the cold brew into grande cup couple times (pouring the CB into the trenta from that) so the tap doesn’t get contaminated and I don’t spill coffee everywhere. 

I don’t think it’s ever destroyed our CB supply since we usually make 2-3 batches every day. Then again, that’s just based on my store’s volume, so your results may vary! But since CB changed to 7 days there’s not much harm in keeping a consistent backup supply :)

We ID any partner that comes to our store unless we know them personally. Too many incidents of partner number misuse in our district; eventually a partner from another store was separated from the company, others were written up, it was a whole mess.

Or the whole thing could be circumvented by using the actual partner card whether physically or in the app 🤷🏻‍♀️"

starbucks,fhf7ssc,t3_f2uq3x,1581537964.0,"In addition to what’s been mentioned, since seven is the start of peak, you will (as always) be expected to be clocked in with your apron on and on the floor checking in with your playcaller *at your scheduled time*. So make sure to give yourself an extra few minutes beforehand to get in the door, put your stuff away, get a drink, go to the restroom, etc. as the playcaller will need to deploy you immediately at seven. That ten minute buffer to drink my coffee and go pee makes all the difference in the world between me having a great morning and feeling groggy and gross all day. 

But don’t be too stressed! I love the busy workflow of peak, and it’s awesome seeing everybody work so efficiently together. Plus, more than likely, you shift will be aware that you don’t usually work peak, and will put you somewhere more low-stress and not production-focused, such as POS or DTR. 

I will also say, please don’t take it the wrong way if the morning crew seems a bit short or blunt with you. I’ve noticed that at most stores, AM partners have a much more quick and sometimes intensely direct communication style — I promise it’s nothing personal and no one is trying to be rude! We’re just super to-the-point because we are used to working during heavy traffic and the time-crunch that comes with that.

You’re going to do great! I love peak, I wouldn’t trade it for the world; maybe you’ll feel the same after you try it out :)"
starbucks,fgu1wpj,t3_f0g8l8,1581112249.0,"If you’re the opener, most of the time you’ll be the playcaller during peak, so your number one priority is *protect your peak*! 

When you first get into the store, knock out all the opening tasks (may vary depending on location) and as another person commented, play catch-up from the night before if necessary. At my store, I start running tens around 5:30, the last ten I’ll run will be at 6:40 at the *latest*, and obviously no breaks during peak. We try to get a complete restock done before peak as well — I usually assign it to the barista who comes in at 6 or 6:15. 

When it comes to actual deployment, check the play-builder tool on the iPad — adjust it for the daypart and the number of partners you will have on the floor. Then you need to think about who to deploy where. 

I always try to consider a few things: 

1. Where do I *know* a partner will rock it out? This is the whole “aces in their places” deal you’ve probably heard people talk about. 


2. Is that position something they’re burned out on? I.e., have they barred for the past three days during peak and could use a break? 


3. Which partners have good synergy and will create an effective team that communicates well and supports each other? For instance, do the three bar partners work well together? If not, I’ll switch things around.


4. Sometimes, you’ll be working with a green bean or a partner who is limited in their capacity. For instance, I had a barista with a broken arm, so they could only be deployed to POS. I also have a barista that gets severe anxiety during peak if they are deployed anywhere but CS. So if there are some accommodations that need to be made, be sure to consider those. 


And of course, think about where *you* can best run the floor from! Your SM may have a preference, but if not, make sure it’s somewhere you feel comfortable and a place from which you can keep an eye on the entire floor — *both* cafe and drive-thru, if your store has one. A lot of people I know run shifts from DTO, I know a couple that do CS, but the overwhelming majority of SSVs in my store run their shifts from OS. 


Lastly, don’t be afraid to flex your play or even change it if things aren’t going well. Be confident in your decisions but not afraid to adjust them! As the playcaller, the team is looking to you for clear direction and support :) 


Sorry, that got a bit longer than I meant it to be, but I hope it helped. Best of luck!"

starbucks,fgqikxo,t3_ezysso,1581024874.0,I *just* looked at the spring now brewing... I don’t remember what it is but I can tell you for sure it’s not Chiapas. Anniversary blend is coming soon though!
starbucks,fgn8wyw,t3_ezf82z,1580939912.0,"I was the literal runner-up for the first *year* I worked for Starbucks before I got it. I know it sucks, but try not to worry too much over it. If you’re doing exceptional work, I’m sure your partners & SM see that, and more than likely your time will come :) 

If you’re feeling really burnt out and unrecognized, my suggestion is to first look at yourself (asking am *I* making the effort to tell others I appreciate *them*, filling out green apron cards, etc) and then talk to your SM or an experienced SSV about how you’re feeling — they should be able to give you some insight. Maybe you’re doing everything right and your turn to be prominently recognized just isn’t here yet... or maybe there are areas that you need to work on. Either way, you’ll most likely come out of that conversation feeling better. 

Good luck!"
