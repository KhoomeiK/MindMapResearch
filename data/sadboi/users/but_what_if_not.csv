mentalhealth,fmicp98,t3_fv5y5j,1586106958.0,All of this is so accurate I can't fine a unique thing to say. All of my teachers loved me and I struggled maintaining relationships with people my age. All of my friends are 6-10 years older than me.  No one realized how much younger I was than the group until we celebrated my 30th.

mentalhealth,fm6iawl,t1_fm6h93j,1585794700.0,"I never considered it before, but it makes a  lot of sense at this point. Growing up,  emotion was always viewed as failure,  so I've suppressed a lot. But there's no suppressing this. I'm starting to realize that I am an empath and would probably benefit from learning more about it."
