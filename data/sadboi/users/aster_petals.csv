BPD,foww0s5,t3_g9yezo,1588128359.0,"Keeping a consistent sleep schedule is important. Not easy, but important and can help your mental state in a lot of ways. Waking up early is often associated with being productive, which mentally may jumpstart your mood if you’re able to do it.

When I don’t want to get up, I try and think of something to reward myself with. Anything small or worthy enough to get me out of bed. Have some coffee or something to help give you energy. 

My last ditch effort is keeping a bottle of water by my bed, chugging it when my alarm goes off, and waiting until I have to pee so bad I have to move. It sucks, but it works.

Also, having an accountability buddy could help if you have someone like that in your life to try and motivate you. These are tough times, just know you’re not alone. I’m rooting for you!"
BPD,fowvcha,t3_ga0cc2,1588127944.0,"I definitely feel you on the black/white thinking and it’s something I struggle with a lot.

There’s a DBT skill called “check the facts”, which is not an easy one to use, but can help you work through what you’re feeling. 

It’s tricky navigating new relationships when your past ones have been so fucked up. I’m currently struggling with that too. I have to remind myself this person isn’t like the others, they haven’t exhibited those same patterns, and if they haven’t given me a reason not to trust them, I’ll do my best to open up. Sure, I could get hurt again, but I can tell I hurt the other person when I assume they’re going to treat me poorly. Relationships need trust. I hope this helps some, you’re not alone!"
BPD,fowuxhi,t3_g9zapr,1588127688.0,"Your feelings are valid. This is a tough time. Sure, some people might have it worse, but you have to remmeber what you’re feeling is valid. If you got 5 hours of sleep and another person only got 3, you’re still allowed to feel tired and valid in doing so.

Try to express the feelings in healthy ways (I know, easier said than done). If you haven’t looked into DBT skills before, I highly recommend those. If you have questions or want help with any of the skills, I would be happy to help! I’m rooting for you, and remember, you and your emotions are valid."

BPD,ffe1jt7,t3_et01mi,1579834296.0,"I want to send you all the good vibes. I know in the moment (and even after these hard moments) your mind will try and tell you terrible things. It will try to convince you that everyone hates you and nobody cares. Don’t listen to it. There will always be people in your life that care. Hell I am just a redditor with BPD and I care enough to leave you (what is hopefully) an uplifting comment. I hope you find your receipt. I think it’s good that you dropped the class if it was causing you harm. Keep at it, you got this. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to somebody if the thoughts continue to be bad. I’m proud of you for posting here. Do it again if helps with the thoughts. I’m rooting for you."
BPD,ffe167s,t3_et2oat,1579834026.0,"I can understand how frustrating and triggering that feeling is.

Do you often ask them to do things as well, or are you always trying to be on the receiving end? Things that have helped me reconnect with friends is when I try and make an effort. Just asking them to get lunch or have a movie night, any small activity, shows that you care about them too. For me, I used to be so bad about reaching out first because I never wanted to be a bother. What I didn’t realize is my friends were taking it as me not putting in effort into our relationship. 

Your experience could be extremely different from mine though, if you have any more details on your situation I can try and offer other advice!"
BPD,ffdzp0z,t3_et2g7y,1579832955.0,"If you feel in control enough to not do anything too rash, sitting in a car/going for a drive while screaming to your favorite music usually helps me a lot. Definitely don’t do that if you feel like you’ll be tempted to drive recklessly or fast, I know the temptation.

Taking a pencil and making marks in a notebook. Bonus points if the pencils are colored.

Going for a walk (if weather permits). 

Sitting in the shower with hot (or cold) water.

And my personal favorite:

Get a ziplock bag, fill it with water, carefully seal, and put it in the fridge for 20ish minutes or until it’s cold. Place the bag in the palm of your hands and put your face into it. It’ll feel silly, but it’s amazing how much a change in temperature can help lower a heightened mood. Running cool water over your wrists can have a similar effect."
BPD,ffdz9fi,t3_esxuwp,1579832639.0,"I was terrified of starting DBT. Before my diagnosis, I was put into a “general depression and anxiety” help group in conjunction with my individual therapy. I hated it. I didn’t feel like I could relate to anyone in the group, and nothing seemed to click. I didn’t want to sit around and talk about my problems and gain half hearted sympathy from peers who don’t really know me or care about me. When I told my individual therapist about how unhappy I was, and we started to delve deeper into the issues I was really having, we quickly realized I was in the wrong group.

So they moved me to a DBT group specifically centered around personality disorders. I was super hesitant and barely spoke the first two sessions. Our sessions were two hours, where the first 30 minutes to an hour were group check ins where we would talk about something that happened that week and how we either used the skills we learned, or trouble shoot skills (I.e I know I should have used X but I didn’t know how). You then got constructive feedback from the group leaders and your peers. The last hour was dedicated to learning or reviewing DBT skills. It’s hard, and some days you won’t want to go, but I encourage you to try it for a few sessions. The skills have helped me tremendously and being surrounded by others that are experiencing similar emotional instability and can connect really makes a difference. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me! I was in DBT for the better part of 2 years."
BPD,ffdykdx,t3_et2e3b,1579832137.0,"100% relatable. For me, it’s almost like a “controlled” split, except I still don’t have any choice. It’s just my brains way of dealing with high emotions when I get so overwhelmed. Upset by something big or small and want to cope with it in a healthy way? Nah let’s just shut everything down and feel nothing instead. I think the first step to getting better is recognizing the behavior. For the longest time, I never noticed that’s how I was coping. Being aware and in the moment when it’s happening helps me feel like I’m a little more in control. The more aware of how black and white I live, the more comfortable I start to get living in the gray, if that makes sense."
BPD,f8sdp6c,t3_e1rybr,1574777965.0,"You put it into words !! I've been struggling to describe what this is like for ages. It's something I obsess over, especially after just meeting somebody for the first few times, and I hate every minute of it.  I don't understand because I honestly have a pretty low libido, but these intrusive thoughts bombard me on a daily basis. You're definitely not alone."
BPD,f8e6aqs,t3_e0h7hm,1574519818.0,"I'm currently on the fence about giving it up because of these reasons. My issue is control. Alcohol usually makes me feel really liberated so I just keep wanting more and more until im blackout drunk and texting or facetiming people I shouldn't. But like you, I'm young and all my friends go out on the weekends, so it'll be hard to limit myself. Just last weekend I got black out drunk and told some guy I had known for 15 hours my entire life story. It was overshare city, and I'm still embarrassed by it. 
Just know you're not alone in this !!"
BPD,euw5w1c,t3_chpc8a,1564070947.0,"Unfortunately, I don't have a solution, but I can relate 100%. I get jerky and twist my fingers, almost like I'm wringing them out. Not in a painful way, just as an awkward ""I have to do something with my hands!!!"" way. Sometimes I have issues speaking too. It's like I'll be talking normally and almost get through a sentence when I feel like I've run out of air or the words are caught in my throat. I usually have to swallow and breathe and then finish my sentence, so there's this weird pause where I make a noise like I'm about to choke it's so embarrassing. I start a new job in a week and I'm preparing for the embarrassment now."
BPD,euw4hfe,t3_chnlv6,1564070142.0,"I'm 22 and just recently went back through some of my old high school and middle school things. Turns out, I kept *everything*. If a friend wrote me a note in the hallway, I kept it. My friendships were very volatile growing up. I didn't have many friends because of how i acted, but i did have 3 ""close friends"". My ""best friend"" would alternate between the three of them. I was splitting way before i even knew what spilting was and i hurt every one of them for it. It was interesting going back and reading old notes now, but also very saddening because I had forgotten how severe my behavior and the treatment of my friends was. It's a wonder any of them still talk to me."

BPD,etkuku5,t3_cc61qw,1562909219.0,"If you haven't already, try and check the facts of the situation. You mentioned your FP usually isn't very fast or consistent with responding. Did something happen between the two of you that  would have changed your relationship? You mentioned texting something benign, so I would assume your FP likely saw and acknowledged it and forgot to respond as long as nothing else had changed between you. They likely aren't ghosting you on purpose.

I've been in this situation and know how terrifying and anxiety inducing it can be. Try to analyse the facts. If talking about it further with someone might help, feel free to PM me!"
BPD,etksg5p,t3_cc4uin,1562907093.0,"I just wanted to send some good vibes your way. I don't have any life changing quotes, but a few of my favorites to remember when I'm in a dark place include ""this too shall pass"" and ""so it goes..."". Be kind to yourself in these moments of darkness. Reach out to those friends and family that make you feel good. I hope things get easier soon. The darkness has an ending, you'll be able to get out of it I'm sure."
BPD,etisq9t,t1_ethprxj,1562858978.0,"Sure! What really helped me was tracking certain behaviors I wanted to change and certain emotions that I have the most issues with. I wasn't very good at doing it everyday, but I was pretty consistent about filling them out on my really bad days and really good days. For example, one of the behaviors I want to change was isolating myself when I knew that wasn't healthy, and some emotions I track are misery, anger, happiness ect. So in the beginning of DBT if I had a bad day, almost all the negative emotions were 5/5 high intensity and I engaged in the behaviors I'm trying to change. As I went through DBT, I would still have bad days but I noticed they wouldn't last as long or the intensity wasn't as high. So the chart was very qualitative, but I had some concrete data to help me think about it.
Essentially, I would go back through my bad days and good days and think ""okay, how well did i actually handle it"" because of course on bad days it always feels like the end of the world. And over time, I felt like I have steadily gotten better, theres still just a lot of downward humps. But that doesn't mean I'm not improving overall.
I hope this makes some sense, if not let me know !"
BPD,ethlk4w,t3_cbqw9e,1562819156.0,"I just wanted to say I can hardcore relate, and you're not alone. I'm still trying to figure out how to live happily without a fp.

BPD,ethleg7,t3_cbolo9,1562819009.0,"I agree with a lot of the other comments. For me, it really felt like I would go through a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes I would hate DBT so much I would walk in ready to quit. Othertimes, I felt like it was really doing wonders. Something that helped me was creating a ""recovery timeline"". Basically, I qualitatively mapped out big events in my life and tried to see how I reacted, essentially creating a zig-zag line graph. What I realized was that I still had bad down periods, but the ways that I reacted had significantly improved from where I started. Even if I felt like shit in the moment, I was comparitively doing at least a little better than when I started. This could help if DBT feels like it isn't helping. You may find that it is. I hope this helps some!"
BPD,ethkyn9,t3_cbob5u,1562818612.0,"I can't speak for this specific situation as I don't have all the details, but I can relate and feel like this is a pretty common mindset that pops up for other people with BPD. Part of it (for me, anyway) probably stems from the BPD stigma that all of us are manipulative, emotional monsters (which is not true). Pretty soon, I start painting all my actions in that light. I can make anything sound manipulative if I try hard enough. 

A good skill in this situation can be check the facts. Not foolproof, because sometimes I can't even identify the facts, but it may help ground you. If not ""the facts"", what about your values ? It makes sense that we act according to what we value, and then determine if your actions are in accordance to that. I hope this helps."
BPD,etbkkg3,t3_catced,1562650064.0,"I've been through something very similar. When therapy started working and I looked back at past behavior, I was horrified at how I was and felt so damn guilty.
In my case, I felt I could make it right. I reached out to people I hadn't spoken to in 4 to 6 years. Things started out okay, but they ended horribly and now I'm left with more guilt than before. In my case, I did more harm than good to the other people while trying to alleviate my own guilt.
It sucks, but time does heal all wounds. The best thing to do is live in the present. Validate yourself in other ways. Build positive relationships with the people currently around you. Continue to grow and learn. Your past mistakes don't have to define you. Feel free to pm me if you want to talk. Take care💜"
BPD,etbk33n,t3_cav0cf,1562649561.0,"I relate to this so much. I've been in a downward spiral these past few weeks for seemingly no reason. I've been distant, and I constantly have the urge to cry out for help because I desperately want it to end, but I know it won't matter because it won't change. 

What can help me sometimes is just writing out a stream of consciousness. Sometimes I'll arrive at the underlying issue, sometimes it helps to get things off my chest on paper, and sometimes it doesn't do shit. 

Just know you're not alone, I'm rooting for you."
BPD,et9zq7d,t1_et8r75w,1562608974.0,"I like this a lot. I think pros/cons makes me overanalyze everything, so simplifying it by looking at values sounds really helpful. I'll give it a try, thank you so much!"
BPD,et8mtzc,t3_cag0f0,1562561621.0,"Yes 100%. It wasn't until almost 3 years of seeking therapy (and being treated for the wrong illness) that I figured out it was BPD. I definitely wasn't very educated on personality disorders, and when BPD was brought up, I was in denial that it could be that for a long time. Once I started DBT treatment, therapy really started working, and the pieces started to come together."
