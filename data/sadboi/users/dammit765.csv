You’ve got a lot of power you just were never showed how to use it properly, so how are you supposed to know what to do? What’s been helpful for me is surrounding myself around friends and their families (if they’re healthy) as well some hardcore therapy."

BPD,fb7h2le,t3_ebvocu,1576589808.0,"Oh my god yesss. That was a huge part of being a teenager for me, I would latch onto parts of different peoples personalities (famous people, people I met, people I know..) and find that quirk that would make me feel like them or make me feel as lovable as them and try to incorporate it into myself. Never worked out well lol.  I still do it randomly, but if u tell yourself that if this “quirk” isn’t something you naturally do then it won’t be given over in the same way the original person does it. You have your own quirks and lovable little things that you do without realizing it, find some comfort in that. At least that’s what I try to do."

infp,f8s8ci3,t3_e1u8p5,1574773138.0,I was thinking that also! And that was the specific reason why I didn’t want to watch it (even though I really want to so badly) because I feel like I’d relate too much to the character and then go crazy. Very logical thought process obviously 😬
infp,f8r92xf,t3_e1qjuq,1574734865.0,"Yess, I actually get incredibly insulted when my friends say things like “your so different in text” or”you’re so much more expressive/witty over text” but almost everyone says it, bc it’s true, unfortunately,  I need time to think things through figure out what my thoughts are and then put them into words that sound nice together lol, in real life I’m mad awkward and stumble over my words because my thoughts aren’t in word form yet."

BPD,eyyrfva,t1_eyy59j6,1567599597.0,Cry honestly haha. These feelings are usually triggered by either something that happened that day or by a song/movie where love is so present. I should probably stop watching these movies but it’s so addictive to watch something you wish you had.
BPD,eyyrdaa,t1_eyy4zwu,1567599533.0,"I love them, but I’m unable to express it. There’s also the boredom factor because I feel as though these people don’t really understand me yet they claim to love me."

infp,eyktjb9,t1_eyk1u54,1567167599.0,Right?? Like I know I pick up on feelings and motives and just because those people aren’t able to recognize it/come to terms with the fact that they feel/think those things doesn’t make us crazy for picking up on their underlying feelings that they’re not even aware of. It drives me crazy. I just hate feeling like and idiot when I know my instincts are usually correct.

Granted there’s lots of paperwork and it can feel mundane and pointless, but then u see a client and actually help them and ur like woahhh, life is meaningful. If you’re really unhappy u can always go back to school and change careers, obviously there’s many setbacks especially with money, but if u think it’s worth it to take out the loans for ur future happiness then go for it.
