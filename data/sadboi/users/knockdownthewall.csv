Unreciprocated love sucks (speaking from plenty of first hand experience lol), but I think relationships are a game of constant trial and error, even for people who it should be ""easy"" for- the game is just a lot harder if you're not an instant charmer, but in a way that makes it more rewarding.

Because of this the creative process of writing the lyrics, picking instruments, designing the music video etc. is entirely controlled by producers and people who are experts in the industry rather than the singers and songwriters themselves. Everything, from the subject of the song, to the diameter of the idols waists, is decided by market forces, and not an individual form of expression

This happens a lot in western pop as well, don't get me wrong. But there is also a large focus from consumers and producers on the creative integrity of music, and there are plenty of artists who started their own careers with songs they wrote themselves, or at least have control over the creative process according to what THEY want their music to communicate. K-pop isn't the only type of popular music in Korea, but its monopoly on the mainstream industry makes it very difficult for musicians to be successful if they don't fit the standard, either in image or the music itself."

I'm not usually that much of a sociable person anyway, but I'm always at least looking for opportunities to make friends and build new connections. Now it's basically impossible and my current status of any form of friendship is not being close enough to anyone to regularly talk online. I've only been talking to my brother and dad for the past month and tbh, I really miss going out to meet people even though I barely did it to begin with. 
I've really been treating myself like shit. Waking up at 2-3pm everyday and doing nothing except replaying old video games and watching crappy TV. I haven't been taking my meds and eating maybe 1 proper meal on a good day. I feel so fat and disgusting even though I haven't gained any weight and the fact that quarantine makes food harder to get just makes me feel even guiltier when I do eat. My mind right now is just constantly flicking between half urges to starve myself to death or jump from my window and feeling immensely guilty for even thinking of hurting my family like that. I had to drop out of school earlier this year and reapply to redo this year because the amount I had missed out on from being too comatose from depression/anxiety to go in made it impossible to catch up. I feel awful about being the person whos going to have to redo a school year, and even though I know it's got nothing to do with my intelligence, the fact that I couldn't hack it the first time around makes me feel like a joke. 
I hate this person I'm turning into. I mean to use the time I have between now and autumn to finally set up my art business, or learn a language, or earn some money, or *something* worthwhile, but so far I haven't done anything and I keep thinking even if I do I'll just fail because I'm incapable of being as successful as I want to be. I keep taking out my shitty emotions on whoever's close whenever I feel like I can't bear it anymore which is a really shitty thing to do and only really creates a positive feedback loop of feeling even worse about myself and doing even more destructive things. 

I spent all day today crying or trying not to (well, by all day, I mean the 4 hours since I woke up at 3) and eventually stormed out and spent about an hour in bed unable to move. I can't cry because I don't want to feel myself crying. I just want to dissolve. I feel bad about pretty much everything there is to feel guilty about and I just want to make myself suffer.

Meds are the main thing- a trip to the GP won't suffice in getting a prescription catered to your needs. But you also have things like specialised therapy which needs an outside influence to work, such as trauma therapy, or dbt, or therapy for OCD and eating disorders. 

DIY recovery can work well for things like mild-moderate depression and anxiety, but if you have a mental illness which falls on the psychosis spectrum, or is linked to trauma or developmental issues, it's like trying to walk up a cliff. 

Working on yourself without intervention can make a massive difference and ""cure"" people in quite a few cases. But the point is that shouldn't be necessary. You shouldn't have to carry this burden yourself because there's noone around to help you, and support should be available if you feel like you would benefit from it. Mental illness is frigging hard, and you cant deal with it by yourself without it having a toll on your life."
depression,fixnc6m,t3_fadu9h,1582823532.0,"I have so many bad experiences with CAMHS, it's ridiculous. They've known I'm extremely depressed and at risk of serious harm from others as well as myself for over 6 years. It took a suicide attempt 2 years ago for them to finally decide to refer me, which basically just meant my name being put on a 6 month waiting list and sending me home from a&e with a ""care plan"", essentially boiling down to healthy habits, despite the fact I obviously needed intervention and anyone would half a brain would know bath bombs and vitamins or whatever shit won't make any difference to a suicidal person with a backlog of trauma. I'm lucky that I even got the referral and didn't try again. I know people who have died aged 17 because the system was too slow for them to get the help they urgently needed, and has this mentality of only solving problems when it becomes a serious safeguarding concern, by which point it's probably already too late. 

I decided to go private, as you did, and even that was a mixed bag. The good part of it was my med review managed to identify all the problems medical professionals in the NHS missed, but at the same time , even with my dad's health insurance we could only afford 2 or 3 sessions a year. Unless you have money, good parents and a visible illness, there's basically no way you can get help. It's pathetic for a country that's supposed to have nationalised healthcare. 

The hospitals are probably the worst part of it. Imagine a hotel, except it's built like a prison but with stricter rules, with 1 or 2 windows total, no way to go outside unless you spend weeks convincing the staff you're well enough to not trying slit your wrists with a twig (bc apparently people do that) and no way to pass the time except the odd group therapy session. Then add staff who are underpaid and have no idea how to deal with adolescent mental illness because the NHS can't afford support workers with psychiatric or even therapeutic training. You end up with a place filled with kids having panic attacks or episodes with noone even bothering to help them except their friends who shouldn't have that responsibility. It's the most counterintuitive space to get better, because everything has to go through a bureaucratic system with no concern for individual needs. 

CAMHS desperately needs funding. I cant imagine spending years training for a role in mental health, only to end up sitting across from a suicidal 13 year old and having to tell them you can't help them because of budget cuts. It's really sad, a lot of them try their best but aren't nearly qualified enough or equipped with enough power to make any sort of difference."

But when you hate someone, that respect disappears, and you'd be perfectly complacent if not happy if harm came to them.

That's why hatred is such a bad thing. You might not actively increase a person's suffering, and even try to reverse it, but from the moment your disrespect for someone goes from simply disliking something they do to disliking something which is a fundamental part of them, there's no moral barriers between you and harming them -or even just being complacent in someone else harming them.

it for years before their consultant reluctantly decides to give something else a try. It's probably because stronger meds are much harder to prescribe for under 18s what with safeguarding regulations and all that stuff (iirc it's the hardest antidepressant to OD on) and/or cost reasons.

My point is that pretty often CAMHS will try to extend the trial period or up the dosage as much as possible before trying other meds, which is really a waste of time if you know it will probably never be effective enough. This is p shit for pretty much anyone who qualifies for CAMHS because your condition has to be debilitating/putting you at risk to even get in, and the more time you spend in that state because of ineffective meds the more likely you're gonna harm yourself. The only reason I have meds that work now is because I saw a psychiatrist outside of CAMHS who was willing to take the risk of a negative reaction to find meds that were appropriate for me. I had to go on mood stabilizers and even go to a psych ward for some of the prescription transitions, but it was worth it in the end and definitely much better than staying on Prozac."

EatingDisorders,fimzd7e,t3_f8kkyy,1582551736.0,"I'd assume you have this difficult because during your extreme hunger period, you weren't exactly exercising the part of your brain which is trying to reframe how much you should eat outside of a restriction context. Imo, recovery really starts when that period ends, because you can only relearn healthy eating habits if you're trying to eat intuitively to begin with, and an abnormally powerful appetite makes that decision making impossible. Don't feel bad about it because you're very early on in the stage of recovery where figuring out this stuff is hard. 

Imo the only way you can combat this is by deliberately acting against those thoughts. I never had much difficulty with specific foods, but when I was recovering from OCD I found that every time I did the exact opposite of what my intrusive thoughts were telling me to do, the dread associated went down. I've also tried this during ED recovery, and it was successful in that respect too.

If, for example, you're in a restaurant and you're about to order dessert, and your brain is telling you ""you don't need a dessert, you've eaten enough, anything else will be excessive, they're not getting dessert so you shouldn't"" etc etc, try your best to order a dessert anyway. The next time you find yourself in that situation, getting the dessert won't be as hard because you've done it before, and so on until it's just a completely in-the-moment decision with no influence from your ED.

Also remember that ED recovery takes a very long time for a lot of people and this won't be easy. It's not your fault if process is slow, and you should be proud for sticking to it."

Of course it's unfair for women that a lot of men can get by perfectly well career-wise or socially without putting much work in to look good, but the double standard people never talk about is when men DO try to put work in to look good, they're automatically vain or insecure."

I do tend to get obsessive over politics...but at the same time I love a friendship with a person who has completely different views with whom I can debate or find common ground with. If I only made friends with people who are politically identical to me, we'd both have no way to expand our views or empathise with ones we don't identify with, and people who get angry when you disagree are just impossible to interact with. 

At the same time, apolitical people are equally annoying. You cant even vaguely bring up politics without them turning off and it's frustrating to see how ignorant they are out of choice. Everyone should be able to, at least, have some basic political opinions and have some sort of conversation about them."

Can you really blame me though lol

>America is a Centrist to moderate-LibRight nation the vast majority of the time. Even by ""abstract and universal"" political compass standards. Quite literally the only reason so many redditors think otherwise is because they seem to think first-world Europe ought to count for what's ""average"", and conveniently forget that continents other than North America and Europe exist

The political compass itself is a *western* invention. It draws axes based on European ideology. African and Asian countries are rarely considered because a vastly different culture means that their idea of progress, traditionalism, extremism  and authority are different. The political compass is a western invention; because of that it inevitably *is* biased towards western politics. We can generalise it globally, but in the end, it isn't the 'redditors' who make assumptions, it's the categorization system itself being fallible with non-western, historically isolated countries which means assumptions are very hard to avoid. 

Also, I decided to place American centrism where I did because while Americans tend to reject governmental authority, historically they still believe in very solidified social or economic hierarchies. The 'reduce the power of the state' rhetoric simply acts as a backdrop disguising the power of the elite and priveliged"
