bipolar,flmtso9,t1_flladps,1585296333.0,"Haha, fun story I saw my psychiatrist a couple of days ago and asked him if he thinks I'm bipolar 1, 2, etc, and he told me he doeeess noooot give a single fuck about that and that bipolar fluctuates a lot and he just wants to get me stable and ok and honestly he is doing a great job, I really like him. He is very old-school, practicing for 50 years I France where I live and he is pretty great. He also talks to me about cool books and bipolar reading materials, haha 

About my type of bipolar, Ive had a full on manic episodes and a loooot of full on really bad depressions since I can remember and I often have hypomania. Also I have pretty frequent mixed episodes. 

I love writing too!! 

I hope u are well and stable xoxo"

BPD,ff3dkbn,t3_eqrdtd,1579538959.0,"My worst fear for a long time has been to be ""too much"" because i've kind of always been the loudest, mouthiest, most emotional in any environment/friend group, and certain people haven't been shy to let me know. On friend once described me as an ""amplifier"" because whatever vibe there is in a certain place, I internalise it and voice it on occasion. But I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing when I am lucid and calm, I rationalize it to be as a sort of filter for people I can interact with on a meaningful level. But it has also costed me some ""friendships"". Which hurt. A lot. And I still hold that fear to a major extent in most of my current relationships. I don't deal with it so much on a day to day basis, but it creeps in whenever someone takes a bit too long to answer."
