I'm extremely optimistic however. I think that's the main difference between me and a lot of others I see on this subreddit. Change is happening everywhere, this is undeniable. We are in fact, waking up. I think a lot of us who know about the conspiracy stuff are too afraid and hopeless because we've done such a thorough job building up the powers that be in our minds. We put them on a pedestal, and in a way, this paralyzes us from living our best versions of ourselves. 

My pursuits in spirituality have shown me that there is so much we don't know. So much to this life that is beyond the seen. Even beyond the wildest overarching conspiracies. We are spiritual beings having a human experience, not the other way around. So at the end of the day, yes fight for truth and love and a better world. But know that this universe has other ideas for our future that go well beyond this lifetime that we will never know or understand in this lifetime. In the end, all we can do is keep our vibration high.. into love and out of fear. 

I'm curious, what do you have in mind after you leave work? I too aspire to establish a more meaningful, harmonious vocation that sustains us rather than having to work at a corporation I know I don't believe in. But we're building up to that in stages."

The telecommunications industry claims cellular antennas are safe because the RF/MW radiation they produce is too weak to cause heating, i.e., a ""thermal effect."" They point to ""safety standards"" from groups such as ANSI/IEEE or ICNIRP to support their claims. But these groups have explicitly stated that their claims of ‚Äúsafe RF/MW radiation exposure is harmless‚Äù rest on the fact that it is too weak to produce a rise in body temperature, a ""thermal effect.""[ ](https://web.archive.org/web/20191005230756/https:/www.iaff.org/hs/Facts/CellTowerFinal.asp#ref4)[(4)](https://web.archive.org/web/20191005230756/https:/www.iaff.org/hs/Facts/CellTowerFinal.asp#ref4)

There is a large body of internationally accepted scientific evidence which points to the existence of non-thermal effects of RF/MW radiation. The issue at the present time is not whether such evidence exists, but rather what weight to give it.

Internationally acknowledged experts in the field of RF/MW radiation research have shown that RF/MW transmissions of the type used in digital cellular antennas and phones can have critical effects on cell cultures, animals, and people in laboratories and have also found epidemiological evidence (studies of communities, not in the laboratory) of serious health effects at ""non-thermal levels,"" where the intensity of the RF/MW radiation was too low to cause heating.

We believe we are free, but that gets eroded and chipped away as the years go by. This is by design. It is the boiling frog. Almost the entire information stream is under control (TV, Newspapers, Radio, Internet, you name it). So not only are our sources of information complicit in the cover-up, but we the people also maintain the lie, because we've never truly experienced life outside of it.  

So it's critical to see that reality for yourself, so that you are not energetically complicit to the system and perpetuate it without realizing. At least your mind can be free. But then after seeing the truth, you must not become crippled with fear by it. My whole premise is that if we want to create a better physical world reality for ourselves, change must happen from within first. You start there and people will automatically begin to do the right things in their life. Eventually, that system will no longer have power over us, and inevitably collapse.

I am who I am today **because** of these circumstances. Under a more ideal situation, I may have never felt compelled to grow and become a better person. Pain has a purpose too, you clearly know that.

>Domestic violence, suicide, anxiety, depression - all of the rates have spiked considerably. This is only the beginning as the sun sets on us, plunging us into a deeper darkness.

Where attention goes, energy flows. Consider surrounding yourself with higher vibe people (and information). They exist everywhere and are increasing in numbers from my observations.

>But it's a small, flickering flame surrounded by an endless dark. There's nothing wrong with that - it's simply who I am.

I wouldn't cling so tightly to your idea of who you are. That idea is.. an idea. You are under no obligation to be the same person you were 5 minutes ago. Your mind is dark, not your soul.

>We don't all need to be saved. What we need is acceptance. True acceptance. Not the need to erase certain parts of our nature, but to find a way to work together despite our differences.

My main message for all people (1st group, 2nd group, Nth group), was to never stop growing and seeking the truth. There is always more to be discovered regarding ourselves and the world around us. 

Everything else I said was merely my belief according to my present understanding."
C_S_T,fmrfd5g,t1_fmna4s8,1586321578.0,"üôè I know, it breaks my heart to see the way we argue and talk past each other. For me, this level of compassion only came after I began seeking inner truth (spirituality). When I was in conspiracy mode, I thought I was always in the right, because people were merely asleep and didn't know what I knew.

I think it's like that at every level. It never ends, because our ability to understand ourselves is infinite (as are we). I believe (and this is me indulging in a delusion) that one day, we will become so awake, and so self-aware, that we will no longer be able to distinguish ourselves from one another. We will completely drop this sense of ""I"" and merge back with the one source energy we had within us all along."
C_S_T,fmqiqqa,t1_fmpbml2,1586300399.0,"On conspiracies specifically, it's been years since I've read any. Guy's like Michael Ruppert and William Cooper come to mind. Corbett Report is good. Abby Martin. Zeitgeist. 

Since then it's been various growth/spiritual/Buddhist type books. Eckart Tolle, Pema Chodron, Parker Palmer, Neal Donald Walsh, Michael Singer. Alan Watts is great. 

In general, I would just recommend reading a wide-variety of books. Choose the ones that most interest you in this very moment. Read what you love until you love to read. 

[Actualized.org](https://Actualized.org) videos and the forums there have been a tremendous resource. 

Some other YT recommendations: Kyle Cease, Sadhguru, J. Krishnamurti, Adyashanti

Regarding conspiracies, if you are a non-believer, you could start with Noam Chomsky's Who Rules the World (a bit of a dense read). But my path began with 9/11. For whatever reason, it didn't click for me until 2013. Watch the documentaries that are out there. The majority of them are turn off's. Too sensational and cheap. You want to find the good ones. I think The New Pearl Harbor was good. 9/11 Whistleblowers Documentary. 

In my opinion, if you're a non-believer and have the time to invest, I would start with 9/11. Once you realize the enormity of the lie there, you will have all the fuel you need to dig deeper. But remember, don't get obsessed. Remain equanimous. 

Once you ""get it"", my recommendation is to drop it all together and focus on your spirituality. Become a better person in every way. Diet, Exercise, Meditation, etc. Cut out all the toxic crap. 

Remember to keep an open mind. Once you build up your intuition you can take what resonates and leave the rest. Don't ""follow"" any teacher. You should eventually out grow each one. Most importantly: Experience is king. Learn from direct experience, not what other's tell you is the truth. Discover it for yourself. Travel, be in nature, try new things, etc. 

Just know that there is a path, and you create it as you go ‚ù§Ô∏è"

So what are you going to do? Get angry? Get others angry along with you? Start a revolution? Organize a crowd of followers and take to the streets? Sure that's one way, but we more or less get the same results do we not? 

Eventually we must mature from this fear/hate/anger based way of trying to change the world. Does that even work when we try to change ourselves? Again you can argue yes, sometimes you gotta get tough. But have you transcended all suffering in this way? Or are you still caught in a cycle of creating more of it for yourself?

spirituality,flsrb1t,t1_flso6ls,1585448848.0,"You are safe. You have always been safe. This is true for all of us. Reality is not as real, concrete, or material as it seems. This experience is both impermanent and infinite in ways our human minds cannot grasp. Death is not the end and birth was not the beginning.

We were more connected to our true nature as spiritual beings (having a human experience) thousands of years ago. This knowledge still exists today, but we've largely moved into the material/ego mindset. 

I believe we are shifting back into consciousness as a collective (I dream big!). Part of that process involves waking up and facing challenges such as you're having right now. Trust me, it's worth it. And we're all going through similar growing pains together.

It's only scary to think about because we've collectively denied death in our culture. But it wasn't always that way. And it doesn't have to be for us either. 

My advice is to not deny this reality and remove the fear once and for all. All fear is based on some form of death. But fear is the ultimate illusion in life because so is death. I know it's not easy to get rid of right now, but just know it's not real. 

What's real is the Truth. And you must begin with faith that it is absolutely beautiful (and has your back) always. The more you grow, faith will slowly replaced by wisdom, because you'll realize these things experientially.. and in that process you will suffer less and less over things that use to trouble you, but now flow through you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
