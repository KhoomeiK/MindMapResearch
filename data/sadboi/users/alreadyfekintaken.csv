 I don't hold on to my hope or even wish to get better. I hold on  to the statistics, to the rationale, to the proven methods, that it can get better. 

Self forgiveness is a skill to be practised. Don't beat yourself down. Do grieve the lost time, don't hate yourself for it. It's not your fault.

But once again, this is the depressive mindset. If you feel better, those years are perhaps a regret, maybe a big one, but really not this horrible wall of shame, misery and envy.
Having missed out on fun and meaningful experiences in the past does not prevent you from having and enjoying them now or in the future. Perhaps there's something else preventing you from enjoying stuff now and having hope for the future, but it's not the lack of past experiences in itself. I think it's important to recognize the difference.

For a very primitive example: while you're having good sex, you're really not thinking that you weren't having good sex for whatever x years of your life and that your friends were. You're just enjoying the sex. And so it is in all areas of life."

You remind a lot of myself in my first couple months of getting dumped. ""It's so hard because he's actually so great"". You ignore the bad or keep blaming yourself for it.

Even if you do, don't let him know that you are still pining for him.
If he contacts you, stay calm. Be short and dry in your answers.

Depression is a bitch and love is a powerful drug which can make it go away (completely and instantly) for a while. It's not that particular person that made you happy, it's the love you felt within. Though it's hard to disconnect if you're still hurting.

What it did is show you that you do have the capacity to feel happy and you can reach it, and how awesome you can be without depression, but you have to work on it. You are certainly not destined for a lifetime of depression. But it's hard work to get better and true happiness comes from within. The happiness due to being in a relationship always eventually subsides after the initial highs.

It's maybe loneliness making you feel bad the most, not lack of that particular person. Social contacts are very important to keep depression at bay but they really don't have to come from a romantic relationship. I don't know about you, but I am a very reserved and socially anxious person and being in that relationship gave me a sense of closeness and belonging I've never had before. This reinforced the illusion that this person was my only chance at happiness, however I try to isolate the conditions that made me happy, from the person. I can find closeness and belonging elsewhere: invest more into platonic relationships, get involved in hobbies or volunteering where I can meet great people.
And when I'm ready to love again, it will be so much healthier.
It's very difficult these days, but still possible to some extent.

I would be on the other side of this. I've struggled with depression and anxiety for some years now, and it was always important for me to know that whoever is with me doesn't feel trapped or is not with me out of pity, to the point that I'd occasionally tell the ex that it's okay to leave me because of my issues.

The last half a year of the relationship my health got particularly bad (due to some other things going on) and the last two months my ex grew very cold, indifferent, distant and condescending.  I kept thinking how it was all my fault, and kept apologizing for the way i was. He seemed so annoyed and disgusted at me. 

I eventually ended up in a mental hospital for my depression. I quickly started feeling better, becoming myself again, but that wasn't enough. That was like a wake up call to ex, he admitted he'd not been feeling very loving. But he doesn't wanna fuckin separate... though he changed his mind within a week, putting me through his reasoning, saying things like ""it makes life easier"", constantly reporting how he's crying so much and how hard it is for him that he HAS to dump me, demanding me to pity him, but also writing how he's having great time with friends. And when he came over for the final breakup, he was groping and kissing me saying how he'll miss it. And also taking in all my compassion after not offering me any. 
Obviously those are not all the crappy things..

I wish he would have just left me with more dignity before putting me through those terrible last months and that disgraceful dumpage while at a mental hospital. I felt that I'm a horrible person, a monster draining people of their life force and I deserved all of this. 

It is good to see that it is possible to be kinder while breaking up with someone due to them struggling with their mental help. I think, if there's just no progress in sight, or you're feeling drained, it's a perfectly valid reason to break up and an act of self preservation. However you should be mindful and try hard to help the other person at least keep their dignity, and I am glad to see here that is possible :)."

You don't have to justify your emotions to anyone, especially yourself. Perhaps explain to your family or therapist, but not justify. Don't feel bad about feeling bad or not feeling bad enough. 

It's so great that you are recognizing depression and reaching out for help at your age. Have you tried reasoning about meds with your family? Explaining what important experiences you're missing out on because of the way you're feeling? Have you tried discussing the fears your family has, why they wouldn't want you to go on meds? Maybe you could help them overcome those fears by together becoming more informed. 
Is your depression affecting your schoolwork? Addressing the depression would likely help with that, and parents often respond well to improved schoolwork.

 So even if the past is weighing heavily on you and you are convinced that you're permanently broken because of it, keep working on the now. Being  happy (or just ok) now is far more valuable than nostalgic distant memories.

The question here is really not about whether you have a chance or not. It doesn't matter. That is because it's just extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate and, yes, selfish to barge into this person life after they have moved on. Your ex is in a long term relationship, it's reasonable to assume he's well past moving on.

Breaking up with someone because you want to be single and focus on yourself is not necessarily selfish. But you have to accept that your actions have consequences. You can't just undo your decision, you can't undo heartbreak.

Thinking that you can just take some time off, break a person's heart, try out other people, see the ex was actually pretty good, and then nonchalantly return to that person's life? After they went through the gruelling healing process and found someone else? Now that would be ugly selfish. And rarely works. 


Don't focus on your ex, stop idolizing him. I'm sure you'll see how many great people there are, if you stop comparing them to your ex. People are great in different ways. 
You are left with a hypothetical version of your ex. Your nostalgic memories. Also, people change over years. You don't even know the kind of person he is now, but probably very different from the guy in your head.

I'm not saying that's the case, but It's easy to lose yourself in anxiety, loneliness and depression in today's climate, and wish back for a situation where you felt more comfortable...

Cutting contact with ex is very normal and even expected. You should not care of how your friends handle their breakups. Not all exes and not all breakups are equal, and you don't even know how they really feel about those friendships. 

I am worried that you are calling yourself selfish. If anything, he's rather selfish for wanting to stay friends. Don't let him push or guilt trip you into it.  What he's saying, is he's still wanting the positives from your company without the responsibility of being in a relationship. The guy should really understand how painful it is to stay ""friends"" with someone whom you loved and who eventually hurt you so much. there's nothing in it for you but pain. He made a choice to remove himself from your life and he doesn't get to choose a level of you in his life, which is comfortable for him.

Don't give him that. You're the main character, you are NOT selfish.

And you are so young. By the time you're thirty, he's going to be just a distant memory. Nostalgic or painful? Who knows (Chances are, it's a ""facepalm"" type of memory..)? But it's going to be that: a memory, not a sting. Probably, even by the time you're 22, it's far less of a sting.
