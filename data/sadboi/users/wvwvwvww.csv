I bought this just for my body because it's cheaper than Paula's Choice body AHA and I thought I'd prefer a toner to a creamy lotion. I was right. Though the PC body AHA is probably better for dry skin because it is a lotion. I put a heater in the bathroom so that I can bear to do a body routine. I use any old urea product, including up to 25% creams (the Aldi one is good) on skin that is darkened by friction/pressure - Dr Dray said urea is the only acid that works on those and I dunno but my elbows and knees are looking peachy. I mix that Aldi heel balm 25% urea cream 50/50 with hand lotion at bedtime for my hands.

TalkTherapy,fqm66hp,t3_gjgtr1,1589472176.0,"You're pretty early on. I think my psychiatrist (who does psychotherapy with me) probably didn't give me a diagnosis till around 2 years of twice weekly sessions. Probably partly because I didn't have a use for a diagnosis but I know for sure she doesn't jump into diagnosis quickly, and some things take a lot longer to figure out than others. Like bi polar you might be able to pin down pretty fast but something like complex trauma is going to take a lot longer to sort that out from other similar diagnosis. I think overall, her approach to psychotherapy means that the healing thing we do isn't pinned on her being able to put me in a box with a name on it. I'm not in need of medication either so that probably informs this too. Like I mentioned with not having much use of a diagnosis. If I had a psychotic disorder I doubt she'd spend 3 years without making sure that was it and following through with medication. But in my case I probably mostly needed healthy relationship and processing skills - so we could do that without the DSM. There's plenty of discussion within the profession about when having a label can be healing and when it can work against healing, so that's a thing as well."

I’d tell a kid it’s OK, you did great, keep going. Don’t look at people with big day counts and think these folks just got the idea that booze was fucking up their lives and the next day was day 1. I had 3 months then I relapsed for two years. I flubbed like 4 outpatient detoxes before I said fuck it I need inpatient and it stuck. Maybe you are still figuring out how to communicate your choice/wants to people around you. I couldn’t have handled hanging with friends drinking at the start. Did you see the therapist?"

Had own room, lovely food, gorgeous night nurse gave me a list of curated TV/movie USBs he had to share, there was a yard. I would watch a Quentin Tarantino movie, go outside, do five minutes of yoga, cry, watch another Tarantino movie. Haha. The kindness of the nurses was the priceless thing compared to outpatient. Having them beside me while I did it (committed to sobriety, came down from the hell rollercoaster) made a big difference for me. I flubbed a bunch of outpatient detoxes before I did that. It was like a key in a lock for me. Pack some distractions. There’s personal work to do in there but it’s intense, you probably won’t want to sit and think about yourself 8 hours a day."

stopdrinking,fpy0vjy,t3_gg6p2r,1588993603.0,"Detox was great for me. Medication made me totally comfortable, it was a breeze physically (my alcohol consumption was VERY HIGH, also). I was treated with dignity and respect and kindness at all times. The isolation is good. That time is for communication with ourselves, it’s you and you getting ready to do the sobriety thing. Big job. I too had my own room and I think that was helpful for me actually doing what I needed to do in there. I did not feel like shit, I did have a few cries. My loved ones sent postcards."

Really bad things started happening regularly. Facetiming my boyf incomprehensible with blood all over my face and a concussion, strangers waking me up from sleeping on the road, and worse.

stopdrinking,fpv4ayd,t1_fpv27bv,1588934393.0,"Not really in the way that you want it to be. You'll be effected by the sleeping meds probably more because your body and brain aren't used to them. It's OK to start therapy with a blood alcohol that isn't 0.0 if you basically aren't ever 0.0. Just try to take it easy. Also most sleeping pills need to be kept FAR AWAY from alcohol, that's real serious, the combo can relax your heart and lungs to death, so don't do anything remotely like mixing them. Even 10 hours after a sleeping pill is not a good time to drink, it might not relax you to death but you definitely wouldn't be a candidate for operating heavy machinery. It's good that you are starting to explore therapy. After I came off my first try of sobriety (which lasted 3 months) I got into twice weekly therapy. It took me two years to deliver myself to a detox (Jeez Louise my poor therapist), but I've had it nailed down pretty good since then. When I said doctor I was thinking of a medical doctor, though. It would be good to explore the medical options, maybe?"
stopdrinking,fpv16je,t3_gfq4k7,1588931136.0,Can you see a doctor? There’s often a bit of thrashing about at the start until you hit on a combo of things that works for you. You gotta have a bit of tenacity in this part. Stay with us!

AusSkincare,fpuwtqw,t3_gfeh42,1588926495.0,"Hydroquinone: Pro: Non exfoliating, non drying. Con: You may want to read through the safety stuff to decide if you're in or out. It is over the counter available in Australian skincare products at 2%, tho (Superfade at Chemist Warehouse).

Azelaic: Pro: No safety concern. Con: Much less supporting data regarding lightening hyperpigmentation, requires standard acid caution and additional SPF care if you're not already pretty great with your SPF.

It might come down to YMMV which one works for a given person, if either.

I've used both Az and Hydroquinone for lightening sun damage pigmentation and left them both behind in preference for Tretinoin and Tranexamic Acid, though I find it hard to tell what the Tranexamic is bringing to the table  if anything, because the tret is obviously working and would be doing the most."

Idk about topless bars but I know that brothels are not allowed to advertise employment opportunities. Not even for receptionists. If you want to work there you just have to cold call.

I'm not going to read all the comments here but I bet that's not it. I'll throw in my two cents along with everyone else's. Call an alcohol specific medical line. Withdrawing can actually be easy if it's medicated. I came down from a truly massive amount of alcohol with ease, properly medicated. You are worth proper medical care and withdrawal from alcohol is a serious medical situation. Keep us updated. We're with you."
