AnorexiaNervosa,f4o2q6d,t3_dl3myi,1571695676.0,"I feel this. 

When I worked in the hospital I sat there in the lunch room with the other coworkers and they were eating and I was just staring at my food.  I loved being alone during my lunchtime."
EDAnonymous,f45xvmz,t1_f4270r6,1571399841.0,"I always wonder if other ED people notice me in the store... but... I don't ""look like someone with an ED"" so probably not."

I'll look into this sub :)"
crafts,f3zczun,t3_darufp,1571266792.0,These are perfection. What kind of mold did you use?
crafts,f3zcvrc,t3_dc23wv,1571266710.0,This is so beautiful. I made some of these paintings too and always wondered how people get the surface so shiny. How do you make an even resin surface on a canvas? I imagine that to be very difficult?
EDAnonymous,f3yw9x1,t3_diui2u,1571260278.0,"10 years ago my aunt bought me potato sticks filled with cream cheese. I loved them. After a while I checked the calories and never ate them again.. I forgot about them for the whole time and my cousin ate them 2 weeks ago and I saw it and suddenly remembered those and how delicious they were. 

I thought about buying them every single day since... but can't bring myself to do so."
depression,f2kcwxs,t3_ddlccp,1570283893.0,"Yeah, I feel this so much.  
Sometimes I invest a lot of time to type out a comment with in my opinion not-so-bad-advice or to give another pespective in a neutral way. I try to explain my opinion in a way that noone can be offended and I only want to help. And sometimes I just ask something out of curiosity. 

And then I get downvoted and downvoted and noone even explains why? I only give upvotes, I've never downvoted anyone. But I get mean or sarcastic comments back. Why can't people try to be nicer? 

But I noticed that the reaction often depends on the subreddit you post. Especially when it comes to sex and relationship advice subs."
CasualConversation,f2esfpg,t1_f2eo6l3,1570203124.0,I think it also has to do with how the brain developed over the years and that the brain couldn't handle the 3D look all of a sudden because it never really learned to interpret the information from both eyes at the same time.
EDAnonymous,f1z3a21,t3_db51yz,1569832438.0,"It's so weird to me that the households of grown-up-people (like so many parents of people on here) don't have food scales. Like... how do you bake? Cook? Even without eating disorders, my whole family uses food scales every single day. To weigh out the ingredients for self-made dough, cake, cookies, to weigh out pasta or rice so it's enough for everyone to be full but not way too much."
EDAnonymous,f1z34g6,t3_db04e2,1569832256.0,"Yep... for me food is like a reward. So I only want to eat  when all the work is done, or after I finished 10 chapters while studying or anything like that. I set goals and reward myself with food. Otherwise I can't enjoy it.   
But often I am too lazy or slow and I am SOOO hungry/hangry when I finish my tasks and it's already so late that I just want to eat and not wait and cook. 

These are the moments when I stand in the kitchen and start desperately crying (with my mom or boyfriend thinking I am a total freak) while thinking about what to cook, which has the lowest amount of calories, but tastes good, makes me full and  doesn't need long to cook - which is basically nothing - so I cry even harder."
EDAnonymous,f1z2slr,t3_db5ebe,1569831887.0,"Everyday I think about eating one of he thousand bags of shirataki noodles I bought a few weeks ago, instead of any other normal-calorie-meal. But I can't bring myself to do it since the last time I ate them because I had the worst cramps of my life.   


How are you? Have you survived?"
