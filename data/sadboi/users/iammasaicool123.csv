depression,f9d389f,t3_dsgdf3,1575229762.0,"honestly, i have never read a more relatable sentence. I get no sleep at all due to my mental health and it really makes me suffer at school as I cannot focus whatsoever as I am so tired, and then I fail my tests and then get more upset with myself and more depressed and then the cycle continues My advice to you is to not let it get to you (as hard as that may be). Sending you love ðŸ’œ"
