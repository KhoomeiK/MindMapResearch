They should tell me if the expect me to pay for something because I will make the plan to pay for it. Sometimes it seems like they think I am balling in dough but I really am not.

marvelstudios,fmlo3ut,t1_fmkug3y,1586190101.0,Yes I agree. But I don't think Loki encouraged him to go to Jotunheim. I believe Thor was prideful and full of angry. Thor convinced everyone else to go to Jotunheim so he get revenge essentially. Loki's plan was to ruin Thor's coronation but going to the planet was all Thor.

\- where was Cisco when the worlds came together and does he still have power?

\- where was literally every other costar that we would expect to be mentioned or introduced when the worlds came back together? (Brainy, Iris, Joe, i etc.)

\- what happened to Oliver's daughter and does she still remember what happened?

\- If baby Sarah now exists then is all of Barry's mistakes undone? aka is Cisco's brother alive? Also, why wasn't baby Sarah older since she was technicality born first? If Diggle got his memories back how does he feel about not having a daughter one moment and then have one the next?

\- Are the world going to stay combined? If so what happenens if someone like Kara's aunt wants to control the world again?

\- If Lex is considered good and the boss, what does that mean for supergirl?

\- If those time wraith-looking creatures where going after the paragons, did they go after Lex or did they go after superman (ray)?"
LegendsOfTomorrow,ff2anwr,t1_fezs5vn,1579498869.0,Endgame was actually trash. Crisis was also trash. So I'd say it is pretty close. I love Marvel and I love DC but both of thier major crossover events in the end.........boring and confusing.

In the comics, Ryan Choi was supposed to be his protege I guess it makes sense when he got excited to meet Ray in the first place. Ray is supposed to go missing, but I am interested in how they are going to get him to leae the show."
LegendsOfTomorrow,ff2afil,t3_eqx0mh,1579498645.0,Ryan Choi is literally the atom same as Ray Palmer because they are somewhat going based on the comics already made Ray Palmer must exit. Ryan was a student or protege of Ray's and then after Ray goes missing he finds clues about the suit and takes up the mantle of the atom. How they made the entire storyline play out they can't do it that way so now Ray and his irl wife are leaving the show. Ryan Choi wasn't necessarily forced IMO because they mentioned him previously.
