mentalhealth,fnwmbj1,t1_fnu6cl2,1587321119.0,"I’m sorry you’re going through that the last thing you need is to bottle up you’re feelings:( 
Also my mom was the same way for years before she came around everyone moves at their own pace the best thing you can do is self medicate with surrounding you’re self with people and hobbies that make you happy and for those days you can’t get out bed or are too depressed it’s okay stay in bed take some rest pushing yourself won’t make it better. Also try talking to you’re mom about seeing a therapist or psychiatrist let her know that you’re struggling mentally.💓"
