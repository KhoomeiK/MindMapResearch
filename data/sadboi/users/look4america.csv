aww,fobha4r,t1_foav9ql,1587659783.0,"I recently went to a local SPCA to see a dog and while I was there I saw this other dog. She was all the way back in the corner, trembling with fear, drooling uncontrollably from the stress. She could not walk past the barking dogs in the kennels. The staff had to carry her outside. I knew that if I left her there, she would not recover, but when we did a meet and greet with my resident dog, it went less than perfectly. It wasn't bad, but it was going to be a risk. I used to foster dogs so I'm familiar with dog behavior, but I wanted my forever dog, not another foster.

I went home and thought about it and a few hours later, drove back to the SPCA. I took her home the next day after having been spayed and she immediately went for my resident dog's face. My heart sunk , but I said a small prayer that it was because she doesn't know where she is and she's in pain.

My prayers were answered, if you believe in that kind of thing, and the two of them are the very best of friends. She is the sweetest hound dog on the planet, and I am so grateful that I made that choice that day. They wanted me to wait the weekend but that would have meant she would spend another whole week in there and I knew she wouldn't survive it."

That is truly the bottom line for the SSA. It's already hard enough to prove if you don't fall into their algorithm just perfectly, add continuing to work to that and you're just adding more work for your lawyer.

As a foster/rescuer/trainer, a few things stood out to me. 

This dog is untrained. A puppy pads trained dog is not a trained dog. Que the ""mine goes just fine one wee wee pads"" but I'm going to have to call bullshit on that. Wee wee pad trained dogs often overshoot. They also tend to use carpets and rugs as surrogate wee wee pads. 

I know I wouldn't allow this to continue in my home, whether or not someone followed behind and cleaned it. 

Second thing that stood out was how she talks to you. There is clearly more going on if a child is cursing at her parents. I wasn't even allowed to refer to by parents as ""he"" or ""she"". It always had to be mommy or daddy said...Never even mind that I was in my mid twenties before a curse word crossed my lips in front of them. 

And my parents, may they rest in peace, were not the best of parents. My upbringing was plagued with alcoholism and mental illness and subsequently, I developed mental illness as well, and yet, not never,
not once in my entire lifetime did I ever consider cursing at them or speaking to them so disrespectfully. Even if they deserved it. 

Bottom line, I know your kid is mad. I dont blame her. But I don't blame you either. 

Maybe try some family counseling. Good luck to you all."

My psychiatrist said that often  doctors focus on the condition in front of them, so if you're presenting in a depressive state, then you suffer from major depressive disorder. If you're presenting in an anxious state then you suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, etc. He said if they treated everything that way, by the time you're done, you're going to have 10 different diagnoses.

insaneparents,ff5xkcs,t1_ff5tvfq,1579613552.0,"Well, I think the problem here is that no solution is cookie cutter. In my case the answer to 'how are they supposed to get to work if the parents won't drive them and refused to give the money to take transportation' is walk. But I lived in a walkable area. It was two and a half miles to work but at 14 I was working. I lied on my working papers to be able to get a job. Took me four years to get out but it 19, I got out.

Commenters come from the place that they know. And some people are unable to imagine anything else. so I can understand why some of them think it's so black and white. Having also lived in the country where public transportation wasn't even an option never even mind walking to a store, I can see a situation where a kid would be stuck without transportation.

That doesn't mean working saving up moving out isn't a viable solution, it just means it's not an  attainable one for that particular person at that moment in that way. Maybe they need to start asking a friend for help or something. Someone at school. Someone at church. Someone that they know will help without reporting back to the parents. It's not easy but there are people like that out there.

I fostered dogs for many years privately and for shelters and sometimes time away from the shelter is all a dog needs to reset itself. We would frequently do weekends or days away from the shelter to give dogs time to decompress. It doesn't give them hope. It just gives them a day to enjoy.

Most of them, when they go back to the shelter get just as excited to see their favorite volunteers. The ones that aren't doing well in shelters stay in foster care.

In addition, a lot can be learned during those grace periods. For instance, I had a foster from the humane society who it turned out was terrified of trains. How did we know that? Because I lived 2 miles from train tracks and every time the train passed so the poor girl got the runs and started to shake terribly. Now what's a family supposed to do if they take her home and can't bring her back if they live next to the CSX or Amtrak line? Now you have a terrified dog and a disappointed family.
