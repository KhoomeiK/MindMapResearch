BPD,ewxbyaw,t1_ewxbm29,1565851930.0,"Yes... the compulsive over explaining ahhhhhhhh 
It drives my friends and past teachers insane! 
I would try to tell my teacher “I need to go to my locker to get a pencil” and it would turn into a big jumbled up reason and I would stutter and my teacher would be like “okay... shut up... you can go get your pencil!”"
BPD,ewxbrf9,t1_ewxbfyv,1565851753.0,I believe mine stems from my past as well. Mostly not getting enough healthy attention as a child as well as being sexually assaulted. I guess we crave that attention as adults when we are abandoned or neglected as children. It’s not as cute of a trait in adults though lol. I wonder if this trait is stemmed mostly from childhood neglect. I know many (not all) with BPD have had a traumatic childhood. I am interested in understanding the statistics of this illness.
BPD,ewxb40m,t1_ewx9zbx,1565851132.0,"Love when you said “there is a self in there somewhere but it’s maddeningly impossible to find her” 
Yes! That’s it! 
So you’re right. I don’t know if “mask” is the right term.
It’s weird because I feel like there are a million different versions of me. These versions feel like me but also it doesn’t feel like me at the same time. I sometimes feel like I am a chameleon. Like I can blend in with many social situations. Like I can manipulate a group of people into thinking I’m one person. Is it that I fake it so well that I start to believe it too? I don’t know really... because then I leave the situation over analyzing everything I said and every comment they made toward me. Then I’ll wind up in the bathroom at a social event hitting my head against the wall crying. I would go from feeling confident to insecure in a matter of seconds. And then I look myself in the mirror and say “okay now you gotta put that mask on because you can’t be the socially anxious crazy person right now” 
I guess that’s what I mean when I say mask. 
But the mask always slips eventually when I try to hide the mood swing. And people see that I am now as confident or put together as I seemed. 
I go from 1. Fitting in with a group of people and truly being confident in ME.
To 2. Becoming insecure in a matter of seconds and having a panic attack 
To 3. Pretending to be okay so I don’t lose more friend or ruin another social event"
BPD,ewx91uk,t3_co76pf,1565848979.0,"I just got major chills because of how much I relate to this post. I have become really good at putting a sane, and charming face on when I first meet someone. However, it’s hard to keep it up. It’s like a war between the part of me that feels overly emotional and the part of me that wants to keep on that charming mask. I can stay interesting to people for a little bit and then people get bored with me. Sometimes I think that the only thing interesting about me is my BPD... that scares people off too though :("
