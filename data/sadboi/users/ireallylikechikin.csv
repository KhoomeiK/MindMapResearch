E: ALSO, having a clear plan can help. grab a thick blanket, flashlights, water in a bottle/jug, anything you'd need in an absolute emergency. being prepared is the most important thing, and hopefully helps clear your mind a little since you'll be ready for anything should things go bad."

* **Payday 2**
* Risk of Rain 1/2
* Terraria (good if you like minecraft)
* **Team Fortress 2**
* Stardew Valley
* **Left 4 Dead 1/2**
* Portal 2
* **Dead Rising** (we played 2 specifically but there is many in the series)
* Garrys Mod
* Tabletop Simulator (board games, D&D, etc.)
* Astroneer
* **Borderlands 1/2**
* **Divinity: Original Sin 1/2**
* Garfield Kart (mostly joking but its silly)

steam remote play also lets you play local co-op, so games like cuphead and salt & sanctuary definitely are on the table for you as well. if you like something casual-ish, pick up roller coaster tycoon 2 and try out ""OpenRCT."" it lets you run a park together online!

another thing we like to do is just watch each other play though games. i watched him play bayonetta and he watched me play metal gear rising: revengeance. i'd recommend a program like Parsec for this. discord screenshare is fine but it looks like basura if you don't have nitro
