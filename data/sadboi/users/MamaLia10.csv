The way I was living and prioritizing pre lockdown didn't align with what is truly important to me. It was like my slate was wiped clean and I got to write the important things in big letters without the extra mess.  I lost a new job because of the lockdown so it hasn't been incredible financially, but we're getting by. I've realized how little I've missed things that I thought were important, and how little I actually need to stay happy and healthy.   I know that I've been very fortunate. My family is all healthy.  We all are still getting along great despite being stuck on top of each other for two months (!).  My husband's unemployment is keeping the bills paid and we know he had a job to return to in June.

TooAfraidToAsk,fo3a7hg,t1_fo36a9z,1587483393.0,">Abortions to save the life of the mother is an exception plenty of conservatives are okay with..

First, there are plenty of Conservatives that do not agree with abortion to save the life of the mother. Also, who would be responsible for determining whether or not an abortion would be life saving for me? How many hoops would I have to jump through to prove it? One could argue I survived the first pregnancy so I could survive a second.  Not everything is black and white. 


>It is also a very specific situation that does not make up the majority of abortions.

Irrelevant.  I'm giving you just one example.  Mine. How many more have a similar issue? Or a completely different reason for their abortion that you have not considered? Abusive spouses/family, mental health issues, other health and safety issues that would negatively affect the mother but wouldn't necessarily put their life in danger.  Would these fall under the line of abortions conservatives are ""okay"" with? If yes, then you're starting to see the point. People have reasons that are not always obvious to you and you don't get to be the judge and jury on abortions as a whole.  If not, then women are simply incubators at that point and people have to admit they don't care about life at all.  It's about punishing the women carrying the child.

>Also, The decision to not have more children is the exact decision conservatives advocate for, as opposed to having a child and then aborting the pregnancy

This proves you missed the point entirely.  Yes, I made the decision.  It was my CHOICE. I have taken all necessary precautions and yet I CAN STILL GET PREGNANT. Unless I decided to never fuck my husband again (which I don't think either one of us would be super happy about).   If I were to get pregnant despite my precautions I would need access to an abortion."
TooAfraidToAsk,fo31s25,t1_fo2xqsy,1587478896.0,"You have a lot of assumptions here. Primarily that money is the main reason for an abortion  I'm married, 10+ years. We have an 8 year old.  We both work (well, prior to current events) have been mostly financially stable, and always hoped to have two children.  That was until my first pregnancy.  I have a physical condition that made pregnancy incredibly difficult. I was in and out of the hospital my entire pregnancy and went through bouts of excruciating pain.  There were times I almost died and times when they thought my child would die in utero. Thankfully, we are both happy and healthy now. My AMAZING OBGYN saved my life and my son's.  That same OB told me I shouldn't get pregnant ever again.  I have an IUD now which prevents 99% of pregnancy.  Notice I didn't say 100%.  If I did manage to get pregnant, I would 100% have an abortion ASAP.  Why? 1. It would likely be an ectopic pregnancy (due to the IUD) and wouldn't be viable anyway. And could kill me if my tubes ruptured.  2. If it wasn't an ectopic pregnancy and was technically viable, it would very likely kill me to stay pregnant. And I'm already a mother.  And a wife. And a daughter. And a human who deserves the ability to protect herself and her family. People like me are why we need to keep abortion safe and legal. And not just for rape or incest. So any woman can make the choice to do what she feels is best for herself and her family.  I had to make the difficult decision to not have more children.  I was meant to have only one child.  I've accepted that.  Pro-lifers always talk about personal responsibility. If I get pregnant again having an abortion would be me taking personal responsibility, not abdicating it."

You refer to them as ""low skilled"" workers. Those workers are the ones making sure you have food in your home. They are the ones washing linens in the hospital.  They are the ones manufacturing the face masks, gloves, and supplies needed to save lives. They are the ones making sure the truck drivers, nurses, doctors, etc. can get a hot meal between shifts.

Do you not have a right to a fair trial or to an attorney if you cannot afford one? Is representation not a service? Somebody should let public defenders and judges know.

Realize that even when ThE StoCk MArKET Is DOinG GrEaT that doesn't translate to the general public being more than one paycheck away from financial ruin. I hope people will wake up.
