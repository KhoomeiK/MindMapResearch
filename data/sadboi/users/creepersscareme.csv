mentalhealth,foir8lc,t1_foiq6xu,1587794444.0,"Don't send him to a psych ward or rehab remove all the stress from his life, but don't completely control him, and spend more time with him like sit down and talk about when he was a kid and all the crazy things he did. Watch a funny movie and it will lighten his mood by a ton. There aren't a lot of things that you can do especially during quarantine but if possible bring him for a walk. I hope your son gets better, and remember to not control his life or he will get worse.
