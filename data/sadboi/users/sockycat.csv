AmItheAsshole,fpg8ec6,t3_gcizmp,1588597038.0,"YTA. I studied English and have a great job in tech now at 25 where I’ll probably end up making more than my friends currently in medical school. My English degree was invaluable—the arts teach you how to think, communicate, and empathize. And because I studied something I loved, I got way more out of it. So many of my friend resented their parents that forced them into a field—do you want your son to be one of them?"
SkincareAddiction,fpefy36,t3_gd00ts,1588546789.0,"Routine will vary based on what I need, but this is basically my every day:

AM:
Wash face with water

Botanics simply calm hydrating face cream

Neutrogena healthy skin eye cream

The Ordinary 100% Squalene

Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunscreen SPF 70

PM:
If I wore makeup, neutrogena oil free makeup remover

Garnier micellar water

Cleanse with Derma-E Skin De Stress CBD cleanser OR  La Roche Posay hydrating cleanser

Instree hylaluronic acid toner

Paula’s Choice 2% BHA (usually every other day or every three days — every day dries me out too much)

Neutrogena healthy skin eye cream

The Ordinary 100% Organic Cold Pressed Rose Hip Oil (I LOVE the scent of this stuff)

O’Keefe’s Lip Repair



If I take a shower, botanics hydrating overnight mask gets added in. It’s a super thick cream I’m obsessed with that will give me mad hydration if I need it"
MakeupAddiction,fpeevly,t1_fpdvb9y,1588546183.0,"I haven’t, no! I’m pretty new to eye creams and skin care in. Since my dark circles are genetic I haven’t had a lot of luck, although a Neutrogena eye cream I bought definitely helps with keeping the more hydrated and I noticed my make up goes on better. I def need a setting powder though!"

SkincareAddiction,fo3mlup,t3_g5j8kw,1587489429.0,"Curren routine is pretty spare— AM I cleanse with water and usually moisturize with corsx birch sap moisturizing. Cerave eye cream under my eyes. PM cetaphil foaming cleanser and Botanica night cream or Botanics night oil depending on how dehydrated my skin feels. Cerave eye cream under my eyes. (I have given up conquering my dark circles but it seems to help with the fine lines)

A few times a week I’ll also use Isntree toner in the evening, and I do a sheet mask about once a week."

I think day 4 was when I was like holy shit, I feel like /me/ again. I get a little nauseous after I take it and it makes me feel kind of fritzy / highly caffeinated for a few hours after. My hands are also have a slight tremor now. But overall it’s been great"
lexapro,fgtdwa9,t3_f0ajug,1581103136.0,I get like jittery and wired for a few hours after I take mine. Almost like a jolt of caffeine. Honestly it helps me be a little more productive so I don’t mind it lol

Anxiety,fgg79jn,t3_exx6jc,1580755768.0,I so feel this. Music someone else is playing seems to be one of the worst offenders. Like if I’m anxious and my boyfriend or friends are playing something—I’ll actually get angry and I just can’t do it. It’s wild how noises I wouldn’t even typically notice make me feel crazy when my anxiety gets bad
birthcontrol,fgg69p5,t3_ey6rak,1580755150.0,I get crazy bad anxiety and fatigue the week before my period starts so when I finally see blood I’m like “oh thank god” because I always end up feeling happier/back to normal as soon as it starts lol. The week before is the WORST. Bring on the cramps and blood if it means I can stop feeling like a basketcase

AmItheAsshole,feniapv,t3_epvp5n,1579285289.0,"NTA. OP, please dump him. I'm not even kidding -- I was with my ex for 5 years and I would have panic attacks so bad I'm be puking and he would FALL ASLEEP. It ended up being a predictor for him dropping the ball in, well, every other aspect of our relationship.

You are not being a burden or unreasonable for wanting someone to /be a partner/. Ask yourself how you would have reacted if he was having a seizure. That's what you deserve.

Dump him. Flat out. He's gaslighting you. You could have /died/. You're better off single than with someone who is actively harmful to you by downplaying a serious medical event. And I promise you'll find an actual partner, and when you do, you'll be like, ""Holy shit, how did I put up with that?!""

I'm glad you're okay. Please take care of yourself! And kick his ass to the curb."

All jokes aside: Fucking run. This poster is a self-centered manipulator and an abuser. I know it can be scary and terrifying to walk away from someone, but as someone who just left a 5 year relationship in August bc he cheated and turned out to be a manipulator, I PROMISE it’s so much easier than you think. You are worthy of love and support and respect and this guy AIN’T IT. PLEASE LEAVE. You’re better off with no one than with someone who will drain and control you. Sending you love!!

SkincareAddiction,evk6ga1,t3_ck36zr,1564576372.0,"I super need help! I’ve always had really good skin—other than a few random breakouts, it was clear. But the last few months I’ve been breaking out in deep, painful zits on my cheeks. Usually only one to three at a time, but they take ages to clear up. I’m 24, female, living in Michigan (super hot & humid rn.) The only “skin care” I’d been doing was an occasional sheet mask & I have a birch sap moisturizer my friend gave me I’ll put on a few days a week if I wash my face with cetaphil cleanser in the shower after the gym.

For the life of me I have no idea wtf is going on. I had a Neutrogena hydro boost sunscreen I wore a few times bc a friend scolded me for never wearing sunscreen (oops) and that gave me a few small zits and I stopped using it—I don’t know if this could be a leftover of that? It’s confusing because the breakouts are only on my cheeks.

The only other changes have been I’ve been eating way more eggs. Ik that’s random but I have no idea if food impacts that stuff.

Please help! I’m so frustrated and I have no idea what’s going on."
