Trouble is, those are the only friends and I'm on the brink of losing them. I had no friends in school, was bullied to the point where I attempted suicide when I was 16. People see me as weird and stay away from me as much as they can. They only needed for helping their school work, but give nothing back to me in return. Can't afford therapy, lack social interaction, and considering doing another attempt at suicide. No one cares!"

AskReddit,f3t4koj,t1_f3t17m7,1571118192.0,"Bulgarian fans were making racist slurs and monkey noises to the black England players during the game. Gareth Southgate told this to the 4th official and the ref stopped the game and issue 1st protocol and the P.A. told fans to behave themselves. This happened again and the game stopped again and the 2nd protocol happened and if there was one not stoppage because of racism, the match would be abandoned. Just before half time, there were about 50 guys in black hoodies that were responsible for most of the racist abuse, and even some Nazi gestures, got kicked out of the stadium. Despite this, racism still continued in the second half and England played on, showing the racists don't deserve to have the last say in football. Racists must not win over the game.

I hope UEFA do something, because no point having banners on empty stands saying: Respect or No Racism."
