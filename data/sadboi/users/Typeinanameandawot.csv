CPTSD,fqzeai3,t1_fqz8riy,1589765552.0,"I appreciate it. The sad fact is that there is so much advice that could be given, but there is nothing that will help me short term (when it matters most.)

The truth and the gut wrencher, is that healing is the combination of many many many small things all of which add up to good health. From my perspective all of those individual things are unapproachable and nonsensical things (things that make me say ""why the fuck does that matter"" or ""why would I bother with something so trivial when im mentally/emotionally/physically depleted, and from what pool of energy/willpower/care do I draw from to accomplish anything?"")

I never understood how people could become addicts, but now I know. It is because life sucks, and because ""god"" cannot be relied on for ""salvation,"" slash doesnt even exist to hear our plights.

Humans should not be forced to endure years of existential crises. Humans could do so much more if we were not inundated by terrible things.

Id hate to be one of those people who just 'oh well' and carry on, or rather, i envy the fact that something so simple and blatantly mindless would work for anyone.

Its like.. oh well? oh well what? As if im the only one who witnessed whatever terrible tragic event that may have occurred.

It takes some kind of something for people to just have the ability to brush things off. Water off a ducks back, people always say.. but what they don't understand is that a duck can become water logged if they are under water too long, in which case they have 'wet feathers' and they wont dry easily or quickly. 

I am a duck with wet feathers, meanwhile anyone I speak to maintains the 'water off a ducks back' mentality, and preaches that to me as if its viable. 

How can we let things slide off our backs if we are already fucked? That's rhetorical, all of this is really, it begs no response.

The deliquescence process generally means that it liquefies upon contact with air.

The idea is that they melt in to a goopy mess, and the hope is that the goop will end up on foliage that animals will eat, or possible also just walk by, and stick to their fur. The spores will go through the animals GI tract and end up on the ground possibly very distant from the source. The animal might also lay up somewhere and rub the spores off their fur. 

Either way, they use animals to spread. 

I think it is amazing. Many spores are light dusty and will be picked up by wind, but not these.

I have tons of hobbies. Too many in fact, and it creates turmoil because there comes a point when you need money to progress with nearly anything, that I take interest in, anyway. I am good at lots of stuff, but for the most part, I fail to conjure any success with selling things. I always give up, or fall short, or am just heartbroken with how little money it makes me. I put a ton of effort in to anything I do to either get shafted on one end, or shafted on the other. The one end is just making and marketing. The other end being the follow through.

I am pretty good with a guitar, but that's just one more of the arts, and as ive learned, the arts make no money unless you are lucky.

I will make say, one listing on ebay, or etsy and then that will fail and ill just give up because im too exhausted to continue. I cannot list en masse because I have nothing to sell other than a few random nonsense things, and I also get terribly discouraged before I even begin. The whole experience of making and selling things kills me, and part of it is I hate networking. I really dislike reaching out for anything, because when I do, I just get bit and hate myself over it. The things I can manage to make are lackluster because, again, you need money for materials and supplies. I hate having to make due with terrible materials. I get no satisfaction out of using what I have around my place.

I do eventually make things but then I am just dissatisfied because its always a far cry from what I had in mind, and usually what prevents me from what I have in my mind is money.

I need a net gain, and a job won't provide me that. Selling things COULD provide me that, but you have to have starting capital to make anything worth a damn. You also have to find a platform, and an audience willing to purchase your shit. 

I dont have it in me to keep searching and looking and trying and failing repeatedly.

I am currently trying to grow mushrooms, and a variety of plants, because those are things that are in the realm of possibility for me, but only so far, and even with that, you need money.

I need fucking mommy to float me on everything, and that just makes me hate myself. There is a difference between receiving help, and just being dependent.. I need 'help' with everything.

I am told that I am not a letdown, but the proof is in the pudding. I am unable to hold a job or even do simple housework, too prideful to collect disability and failing to figure out how to make money of my own accord.

I just want my life not to be garbage. Or rather.... to just stop seeming like garbage... I am pretty well off considering how terrible I feel. It is stupid. I have so much to be happy about, and so much to be thankful for, so many things I could do even, its all just so overwhelming. I am paralyzed by how complicated things are. I have tons of ability, and no matter what, I still just degrade everything, demean everything, and just know it all at the worst times, and more importantly, fail at seeing good things as good. My mind is so tricky. Just back and forth. I will say one thing and mean two things simultaneously, and I will be unable to articulate either. What comes out is usually pretty close to gibberish.

I am enrolled in DBT now which the first year of that was a waste and I am just now paired with a therapist with some actual real experience.

Now its all stillllll getting worse, and it is because change is hard, and my new therapist is actually involved in the process and challenging me. It's a pain. I wish I could have things get better for once, and that's a problem because I am totally averse. I realllly want change consciously, but unconsciously, Fuck that.

What's more, is that the CBT/DBT therapies are only geared towards one thing, and there are tons and tons of things one might need coaching or guidance on. After I finish DBT, I may be more aware, I might be more interpersonally effective etc, but I will still be traumatized and dysfunctional. I will still have no knowledge of how to maintain a household, or how to manage a job.

BPD,f88y7jc,t1_f88w468,1574363629.0,"I just wish I would have known that this shit were on the horizon when I set out to marry, because it is subtracting from me as a person currently.

I should have seen it coming when she always chose her friends over me, or berated me when I was upset she was sleeping in the same bed as her male best friend. Her friend also berated me for that as if it were unreasonable that I ask they not do that.. This is all back when I was kosher and civil, and as time has gone by I have literally reverted to fighting for my survival... I have just been broken down little by little ever since, and as a result I am taking her down with me. 

I want for this not to happen. I see no way to make things right other than what I am already doing. I am doing the therapy bit, taking the meds, trying my damnedest to just do right by myself and her. No dice.

I have just progressively gotten more and more bitter as time has passed because I am literally just gaslighted daily.. I get zero resolution with anything. I just have to stuff it, or end up fighting about it for no resolution. She thinks I am just trying to be right about everything, and that may be slightly true, but I have vastly improved on that and am no longer doing the whole right fighting routine. Now I am just trying to get my wife to understand how she harms me (no matter if it is some perceived thing or real) and what she could do to help me not get so up in arms about things. Things like taking turns while we speak, or waiting for some amount of time in between every next thing we say, or not continuously cutting me off every time I open my mouth. 

She seems to think that it's all on me, my behavior, but it takes two tango and she is not owning her own part in any of our dynamic. My behavior IS all on me, but her own behavior can greatly influence where I land. If she ignores my pleas or advice/requests, and goes on ahead and does all the triggering things I CEASELESSLY am saying she could stop doing to help us both remedy our fighting, or rather, my own blowups, than I am effectively fighting this borderline battle alone.

I have been diligent for 5 years in therapies of multiple types, now in DBT over 1 year and that diligence has not served me. My efforts have been for nothing.

It might be healthier to leave her, but if/when that happens then my worst fears are realized and I am not gonna be doing too well. Everything Ive been doing to keep us together will have been for nothing. Sure I might be better off, but that seems like the easy route. I am too prideful to cop out. I made a promise to myself about keeping it together and that promise seems to be biting me in the ass now."
BPD,f88w468,t1_f88nai5,1574362437.0,"She has done things like 'try' to stop interrupting me every time I speak, by continuing to do it, all the while acting like she's making big change. 

I cannot talk to her unless I literally compete with her for the chance to talk. She will literally speak through me during every sentence, and then go on to monologue for extended periods of time. She KNOWS that overwhelms me and at this point I feel like it's intentional that she keeps me overwhelmed. If I am able to keep my shit together, she knows I will be able to hold my ground and assert myself properly. I don't think she really likes it when I am able to stand up for myself or when im able to keep my train of thought for more than 20 seconds during our tense moments.

At the same time, I hate having to feel like she is against me at every turn. I feel like anyone who is reasonable would want to keep themselves calm, and not matter what I do, I cannot manage to stay calm when it comes to talking to her. She knows exactly how to manipulate me in to anything she desires... 

I attribute that to her being an only child and constantly getting her way with her parents. She does me the same way. No matter what, she's right. No matter what, she's beyond recourse, or beyond taking responsibility for her self. I am always the only one who apologizes for myself and my actions. I apologize to her even when SHE is wrong, and I have no reason to be sorry."
BPD,f88mu7e,t1_f88l1xf,1574357337.0,"My marriage is hazardous to my health both ways I split it. We stay together and I stay stuck, or we split and my life descends in to chaos. I am also throwing away lots of history. She had the blessing of my late great grandparents and in leaving her, that bond is immediately broken, and nothing else could replace that. There are no more blessing to go around. 

We can make it work, but I cannot be the only one making an active effort at changing. My wife feels like she's changing a lot, meanwhile she is not from where im standing. I am sure she is strung out and overwhelmed much the same as me. She can manage to make it through though, whereas I cannot. I am literally aging faster than I should be because of all of this.. It's just a stupid soap opera and it's subtracting from my potential. I wish i could help build her up, but validating phrases are not enough to matter when you are violent or aggressive or similar, and I cannot afford, monetarily, to build her up in to anything. I am just stuck being a schmuck and any of the slow tricklings therapy has to offer, are moot."
