The post pointed to you resenting your daughter having these ""manly"" hobbies, hobbies don't actually have a gender and this was irrelevant but it does show what's on your mind.

You've described her behaviour as shitty and abhorrent, you haven't actually mentioned how you tell her that the part she's giving is wrong, it's all focused on her but you're not even mentioning how you handle the situation. 

>She's at the age where she definitely would just to get a rise out of me I feel. I definitely did with my dad.

You've already decided shes just trying to piss you off, how are you responding when she makes a mistake if you assume she's just doing it to piss you off?

There's no point in making a ""peace offering"" to people who aren't going to appreciate it anyway.

 What happens if their are more ""family traditions"" that you get to be blindsided by? I'd set my boundaries now.

It would be different if MIL or in-laws had tried to treat you like family, but they don't, so I don't see why you'd dampen your wedding day by putting something on your body that you don't want there. Not to mention is this what you'll think of when you look back at your wedding? Being bullied into wearing a pin from a family who doesn't treat you like family?

As for your fiancee, I agree that it's his wedding too, but he's not the one whose supposed to do anything with this tradition, he gets to put it on you. If this was really important to him then he should have known it was a thing and talked it over with you. He should have tried to warn his mother that if she wants you to wear something dictated by her or their family then she needs to form a relationship where you'd be willing to do that.

I'd start sticking up for my dog, you guys might be stuck together for a while so you need to address this for your pets sake. 

If the roommate does something to the dog tell the roommate off, every time. Make a rule, if they break a pet rule then the roommate won't be welcome in the communal spaces that the pets go in (livingroom, backyard, etc.) Since they can't be trusted with your animals. 

 If they lock the dog out back then bring the dog back in and lay into the roommate. Tell them how messes up it is that they expect to mooch off of you and then mistreat your pet and give it anxiety. 

Explain to the roommate that they haven't paid rent and the dogs family so if it's between a rude and inconsiderate mooch and your pet then it'll be your pet.

 Put your foot down, it's your house and they aren't even contributing. If you can't get them to leave then I suggest at least setting rules and enforcing them."

You talk about having stupid disputes and other relationship problems, did you accept responsibility at the time or are you working to see what went wrong so you can do better next time? I can see your friends being annoyed if you shot yourself in the foot and then just complained to them about it. 

I wouldn't join in if my friend decided to go on a rage about an ex that didn't do anything wrong either, you need to realise that they don't have to be your 'yes man' and they probably have no interest in fibbing, it would just to protect your feelings and allow you to unknowingly keep making the same mistakes in the future."

You could tell her that you overheard her talking about you last night, see what her reaction is and tell her how much that hurt. Im sure if she caught you talking so grossly about her, she'd be upset too. It's not fair to you and its not fair that you have to worry about your crying when its such a natural response, you deserve more, if you saw your gf crying would you think poorly of it?

You sound so entitled.
