But you have to realize this is nowhere near as complex as what happened in 2008. In 2008 there was a housing bubble, sub prime loans, and a lot less control in the stock market. Have you noticed how when the stock market kept going down they stopped trading for a few minutes? That's there on purpose, so that what happened in 2008 doesn't happen again today. And this economic downturn is only really a result of fear from the coronavirus. Once that fear subsides everything will be back to normal. The banks still have money, they're going bankrupt like before and loans are being handed out like candy.

Fuckin hard. Until you start getting angry and start throwing up.

In all seriousness, push hard man. You shouldn't be asking how hard,  you should be asking where to start. 

Do a lot of cardio. Walk, run, mountain climbers. At this point, literally just getting yourself moving will help. Walk to the store instead of driving, take the stairs instead of the elevator as long as you're not injured or disabled. Just start.



You're 311 lbs. Just cut out all the bad food and soda, you really shouldn't be debating that. Drink lots of water.
