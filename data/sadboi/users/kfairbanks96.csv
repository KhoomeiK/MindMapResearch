AskWomen,fonfdee,t3_g8d3f2,1587918427.0,"Like several other stories, we originally met on tinder but it took us almost three years to meet or go on a date. I was a sophomore in college and we matched and immediately clicked: same sense of humor, easy flow of conversation, lots of things in common. He worked with a friend of mine and she talked him up to no end. We exchanged numbers, followed each other on social media, etc. and always made plans to go out on a date or actually meet in person but he lived about and hour away and our schedules were so different that eventually it just fizzled out.

Throughout this entire time I was always hyper aware of his existence, I’d see on Instagram that he was celebrating a birthday or him and a (at the time) girlfriend were doing something fun together and I always just thought “I’m glad he’s doing well, he was a really nice guy” and would think of him from time to time. I dated a few people, one of which was longer term, but nothing ever felt totally right. 

Fast forward to November of this last year, I’m at a bar with my work friends when I keep making eye contact with this guy that looks all too familiar but can’t put my finger on why. Finally I realize and tell my friend, “I know this is weird but I matched with that guy on tinder like two years ago.” Obviously that’s not all that crazy of a concept to anyone else, we live in a smaller city. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Finally, the day after thanksgiving I messaged him and asked him if he was living in the same city as me. We started catching up, then talking regularly, then ran into each other at a bar a few weeks later (which was technically the first time we officially met in person). He took me on a date a little bit after that and we’ve been inseparable ever since. You know how they say “when you know, you know”? Holy hell I sure knew. I’ve never had such a genuine, raw, connection with another person before. It’s like I’ve known him my entire life. He’s fun, thoughtful, he makes me laugh until my face hurts. He’s absolutely my soulmate and there’s so many different factors that, if they played out even slightly differently, we never would’ve met. 

It makes sense why some stranger that I matched with on tinder was always in the back of my head after all these years."
