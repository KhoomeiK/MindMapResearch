TLW and JP3 are its forgettable sequels. JW and JWFK (and surely JWD) will go down as nothing more than amusing family-friendly blockbusters from the late 10's/early 20's in the flavor of the MCU movies of the era. I think that sums it up.

One thing I notice is that a lot of JP fans can't enjoy the rest of the franchise because of their disappointment that it doesn't feel the same as JP. But the thing is, *nothing will ever feel the same as JP* and that creates this sort of painful nostalgia. I just put those feelings aside and like the rest of them for what they are. That said, there's been a lot of great points made in this thread about the problems with those movies.

Also, unpopular opinion: I fucking love Blue. When I was little I was obsessed with the raptors from JP3 and had one as an imaginary friend, so JW brought my fantasy to life."

It sounds like he is very deep into this kind of pattern. At this point, it benefits him greatly to remain unwell. He can indulge his child self by going to his parents' whenever he wants. He doesn't have to work. You do all the work in the home and relationship, and don't threaten to leave him. He can keep you close by to avoid his fears of abandonment while also avoiding the fear of engulfment by intimacy.

I think it might be beneficial for you to pursue individual counseling with a marriage and family therapist who can switch smoothly into couples counseling later on. Don't try to tackle this alone."

Always communicate. When she is doing something unhealthy with you or pushing your boundaries, *always tell her*, being very specific and clear, but also very gentle and patient. If she won't hear you, then get firmer. This is a huge one. We usually have no idea that we're doing something harmful or unhealthy.

Say kind (and true) things frequently. Be expressive with your affection if you're comfortable with that.

Try to stay positive. Avoid getting dragged into frequent pity parties or vent sessions. It's not helpful and will drain you.

Don't set the expectation that you will always be available to her or respond to her every crisis. This sets the stage for splitting, thus causing more meltdowns and crisis because you can't always come running. Communicate this to her!

Don't parent her. This is not your role. Reparenting should come from a therapist or an older person in a more distant relationship, not from close friends.

I have both bpd and bipolar. They're wildly different, but often mistaken for each other. Bpd is not episodic, but you can go through times when the symptoms flare up more intensely. My bpd symptoms were mostly quiet for years until an interpersonal relationship issue triggered them recently.

Bpd mood swings happen extremely fast and are virtually always caused by some specific in-the-moment trigger, most often some interpersonal issue. Bipolar mood swings are longer lasting and the triggers are not always obvious and usually something more prolonged. Someone with bpd can go from normal to depressed and suicidal in a split second because of, for example, getting in an argument--then can get over it just as fast. That doesn't happen to someone with bipolar unless they were already having a mood episode.

CPTSD,f8g45uq,t1_f8fwjlf,1574553822.0,"Trauma is a delicate matter. Treating it can be risky. Someone in another thread mentioned how they went to a therapist who didn't have trauma experience and they ended up in a dissociative state for days.

There are different areas of psychology and psychiatry. You would be surprised by just how much there is out there and how little one person can be expected to master. There are a lot of different needs, so it's not a failure really. Trauma is not the only source of mental health issues, so it is not the only focus. I have bipolar disorder which was not caused by my trauma. I need to take pills and utilize different sorts of therapy to manage that condition.

The mental health system and psychology itself are seperate issues. A big part of the problem is that insurance companies severely limits what kinds of therapy they will fund. They prefer short term therapies that have very clear *measurable* outcomes, meaning they want to see the data proving that someone is doing better within a couple months. Trauma work is usually more subtle and longer term. I assure you that the therapists wanting to do specialized trauma work are there, but they are largely crippled by the system they work under. This issue exists in all of healthcare, e.g. opioids being over-prescribed because insurance companies don't like to pay for real treatment.

There *is* a lot of focus on trauma right now and there is a huge push happening to shift the system toward trauma-informed care. The system is broken and there are issues with the field of psychology (let's not even start on the DSM), but it's not the fault of malicious therapists not wanting to do hard work."
CPTSD,f8fplxa,t3_e0gd16,1574547696.0,This is so interesting to me. I work in mental health as well as accessing it and in my area it would be hard to find a therapist who *doesn't* specialize in trauma.
CPTSD,f8fp96g,t1_f8fgwzq,1574547579.0,"If a provider doesn't specialize in trauma, then they can easily retraumatize a client instead of helping them. It's not about looking for easy clients. It's about not harming clients."
BPD,f8d45jk,t1_f86yncq,1574477737.0,This is the nicest thing ever. Thank you so much.
