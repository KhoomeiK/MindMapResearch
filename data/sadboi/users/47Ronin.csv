To be honest the game isn't that different from 6k to 8k. It was trivial to climb to 6k because I clearly had a knowledge edge on most opponents, but that smooths out a lot already by 6k. I think the only big difference I note is that more people skip leveling on curve at 6k whereas people play much more set lines at 8k. That tracked my own play, I only skip leveling on 4 or 7 in certain situations but when I was lower ranked did that a lot more.

Also I suspect people tend to play more conservatively at higher levels, at 8k you often get games where no one even levels to 6 and you're just angling for marginal board buffs in the late game, but at lower levels people are taking big swings and you always see a high roll build winning"

I haven't quite figured it out, but I'm sure the key is planning your level ups to pop big early discovers with imprisoned minions.

To be fair, I'm the kind of guy who's obsessed with trying to mine gold in subpar lines to get a short-term edge, which is not a winning strategy over the long run."
BobsTavern,fqs3r4l,t1_fqrt5c5,1589597845.0,"This is roughly the main line I play:

* 3 mana - Buy minion
* 4 - HP, Buy ideally synergistic minion
* 5 - HP, buy or level depending, roll if you have an extra or sell token to buy 2
* 6 - buy two, or sell token to HP, T2 if you didn't on 5 mana
* 7 - buy two, hp (or T3 + hp)
* 8 - T3/hp, or roll/buy 2/hp (if you're losing at this point you low rolled, you can chill at 3 and try to stabilize with Demons or Mechs but it's a subpar line)
* 9 - T4, hp 
* 10+ - play battlegrounds, strong bias towards Murlocs or Dragons.

Level 1-2 Deathrattle beast spam strat supposedly works well with him (and it makes sense from a theorycrafting perspective) but I haven't done it.

Generally you want to win the first few rounds and level aggressively to 5/6 because you should have a very strong early board. If you don't completely crap out in the early levels your floor is 5th place and your ceiling is victory.

EDIT: I tried to force Saurolisk this morning. I got 3.5 but I sort of backed into it. I didn't get more than 1 golden saurolisk, panicked and started to level, and started losing earlier than expected.

It takes about 200-500k to build these things, often 10 years or so to recoup the initial investment in carrier rent - ground rent."
homeowners,fnkif5o,t3_g24fp6,1587028244.0,"I work in this industry. That guy who came up to you and offered a lease, I've done that hundreds, probably thousands of times at this point.

First thing to know is that very little is guaranteed for you until the tower is built. A lot of these tower projects never get  built because of zoning or permitting issues, cost of construction, or just carriers playing games with funding. Verizon and ATT in particular are lumbering behemoths who have so many compartmentalized divisions they trip over themselves constantly. You might sign a contract but then the funding gets pushed back two years, your option expires, and nothing gets built. So don't ever think of it as guaranteed money until they start pouring concrete.

Second thing is that being near the center of the area they're looking for makes you a prime candidate. While they MAY take the lowest offer, what they're really looking for is the closest candidate to the center of the target area, at decent elevation. So long as your money ask is within range for them, you are a good candidate. Lowballing isn't necessary. If you go TOO high, they might drop you and go with another property, but if you stay in their range you have a shot.

Money: never take the initial offer. You should be able to get $700/month in most cases, and you can probably push them to $1000 or more. If you're working directly with Verizon I might aim higher, $1500. A tower company/turf vendor like ATC, SBA, Ecosite, Tillman, Nexius, Mastec, etc. is going to have a lower cap. It is highly area dependent. If you have the only hill around, they might sign for $1500/month, but more likely you're looking at an $800 soft cap and a $1000-1200 hard cap depending on how badly they want the land. Anyone telling you you can get $2k+ is blowing smoke right up your ass. Tower rents at that level are vanishingly rare, it's cheaper for them to build a new tower if they can find a zoneable location.

Lawyer: to be honest, lawyers are a mixed bag. Maybe 20% of the landlords I work with retain one, and they range from useful to deal-killers. I've rarely seen anyone get a significantly better contract by hiring a lawyer. They get some additional ass-covering language, maybe a small rent bump, but not much other than extra paperwork and annoyance for me in most cases. I have, on the other hand, had people retain ""specialist"" lawyers from the internet with industry knowledge ten years out of date who kill deals with their impossible demands.

Make sure they have to come to you for a lease amendment if they want to expand the use of the premises. Don't pre-authorize expansion if you can manage it. Ask if they do rent-sharing.for additional co-locators. Some companies will, some absolutely won't. Try to get a yearly escalator, not a term one. If they make you do term, get at least 10-12%. Make sure the first term is 5 years, not 10. Make sure there's removal language if you want the tower gone after. If you're farming the land, make sure they remove the footings 2-3 feet below grade. Confirm they cover property tax increases. If possible make sure there isn't an exclusivity clause or right of first refusal on sale of the land.

Depending on the contract there might be other ways they're trying to screw you. It's unlikely but possible. Read the contract carefully and if you don't trust yourself to do that intelligently, hire a **local lawyer who's done one of these within the last decade.** Most of the contracts are handled by middlemen companies like the one I work for and they just want to get a deal done, not hose you. They get paid for completed milestones and only rarely directly compensated for getting the lease under budget.

A billion dollars is an unnecessary, immoral amount of money for any individual person to possess. They might have the best intentions. They may be a paragon of virtue.

You're basically making a flavor of the ""well Trump is rich so he can't be bought!"" argument we heard so much of. How's that working out? The man is literally working every possible angle to corruptly make money. Blago would be jealous.

So your argument is kinda nonsensical. Rich people can be bought too, in fact they don't need to be bought because their class interests are already naturally aligned with their fellow rich."
LateStageCapitalism,fn3wl5i,t1_fn31xsn,1586629335.0,"The long term debt cycle is basically a bubble by design. The vast majority of the economy is credit. Loans pushing costs out create an ever-ballooning economy based on expectations of what wealth will be in the future. Eventually productivity can't catch up with the expectations of future wealth and the economy recesses badly as loans go unpaid.

In a postindustrial service economy, this is basically just a massive bubble that's bound to catastrophically burst when material conditions change. Our nominal productivity is high, but we don't actually make more tangible goods. We're using technology to refine distribution to the point where we have a ""just-in-time"" supply chain that efficiently delivers goods that the public demands, but the creation of which depends on outsourced labor. Our economy needs the global proletariat to sustain itself through imperial imposition.

In other words, the US uses the rest of the world to make stuff and increasingly more of our economy is based on refinement and delivery of said stuff. Only a tiny percentage of people are actually needed to create the means of life, the rest of us just move shit around in an increasingly market-efficient manner, using credit to turn the wheel.

Eventually something about the world will change and the social order will change too, and utilizing credit to turn the wheel will no longer be necessary or desirable. It's really a question of will the mass of people seize the means for themselves at that point or will the rich who currently control the means be able to use technology and leverage to basically abandon the surplus workforce to eat each other."

I was with my first new partner in 10 years, and she was very attractive and much more experienced than me. It didn't help that I also had some other physical issues going on like your guy's blood pressure.

Honestly, he should get boner pills -- viagra, cialis, etc. He should just go to the doctor, explain that he has trouble maintaining an erection, and the doctor will prescribe it. It's very easy (though the pills are expensive). If I can work up the courage to do this as a 30-year-old, surely a 55-year-old man can do it. One note though, he should be careful how they interact with his blood pressure medication, because they affect BP. 

As for what you can do -- don't focus on it, keep kissing and touching, and see if he does other things to make the experience enjoyable for you. If he does, let him keep doing that, enjoy them, and don't put pressure on him to do anything else. Don't let him feel like you need his dick to enjoy sex."

chicago,fmst20v,t1_fmslyym,1586361557.0,"Imagine not ""crashing the global economy for such a small number of people."" Imagine continuing on and going for a ""herd-immunity"" approach with zero changes to everyday life. Concerts, churches, movie theaters, train stations, schools, airports, all unaffected.

Rather than slowing down the rate of infection, we allow it to burn through people as quickly as possible.

Even in the current scenario of ""crashing the global economy"" we have several hotspots with more sick people than needed medical equipment. Not enough ventilators, PPE, nurses, doctors, beds. The only hope here is that there are other places that can pick up the slack and render assistance. Doctors can travel to NYC, volunteers can help fix up degraded PPE in Detroit, California can fly ventilators to Illinois. Companies and other countries can manufacture PPE and ship it to the places that need it most.

If you accelerate the curve, rather than having a few hotspots you now have mass systemic need. Not only NYC and Detroit and New Orleans are overloaded, but now so are Mobile and Pittsburgh and Salt Lake City. And Berlin and Baghdad, Lima and Lagos, Tokyo and Mexico City. All at roughly the same 1-2 month span, because we let the disease spread unchecked. 

More people catch the disease and there is no infrastructure to take care of them. The current PPE shortfalls become mass global shortage as countries literally start fighting over stockpiles. China, having effectively stamped out the spread of the disease by locking down Wuhan, churns out masks day and night and begins extracting unconscionable trade deals with the massive leverage they've been granted by the world's foolishness.  

Billions of people are asymptomatic or low-symptom, but hundreds of millions who require hospitalization can't get a bed. Many now die because of lack of treatment. The overworked doctors and nurses are sick and dying too. The knock-on effects of the collapse of the medical system result in even more deaths as other illnesses go untreated and medical mistakes by exhausted and distracted staff skyrocket.

Not to mention the effect on other industries and the cascading failures in supply chain, production, and the labyrinth of paperwork we use to make sure everything gets where it's supposed to go. Oh, the army and police and firefighters and all essential service employees are sick now too. Doctors and nurses are not only lacking badly needed PPE, now they're underfed, their garbage goes uncollected, and their safety is at risk.

And then, when the dust settles, we get a secondary wave of infections because it's a fucking coronavirus and while being spread through seven billion people it mutated twelve times and now we can never get rid of it.

So now you've killed tens of millions of people AND crashed the global economy. You turned a six-month disruption into the black fucking plague. You utter buffoon, you market-fellating shill, you feckless, brain-wormed child."
