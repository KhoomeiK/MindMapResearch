Copied from Allkpop: ""The poster states¬†that when the bullying victim went to meet Taeyong believing that it was a private meeting, but was ambushed with the fact that the¬†meeting was set up by a reporter,¬†which led to the articles about Taeyong's apology.¬†In addition, five lawyers from SM came to find the victim, leaving them in a situation where they cannot defend themselves publicly.¬†


When asked if Taeyong sincerely apologized, the informant stated:¬†""The victim and I are the only ones who know well if Lee Tae Yong sincerely apologized or not, but to say more about the issue will just lead to harm for my friend and me as well so I'm sorry I¬†can't say much. The only thing certain is that the victim is hurting a lot.""


""My friend and I also feel really frustrated when we see posts saying Lee Tae Yong is hurting. Why is everyone lying to defend him?""


""A couple of months have passed and lawsuits for severe malicious comments are in progress... but is everyone on Nate Pann like this? Lee Tae Yong met the victim and acknowledged all three incidents and apologized, but no one even believes that and keeps saying that I am the perpetrator. That comment is a recent one too and that person even met Lee Tae Yong with me. I'm suffering a lot because of the investigation and still... why are you still trying to discredit me? The people saying I'm fake are so much worse so why?¬†I had to change my name and phone number because I'm a sexual assault victim... and I have to ask people not to rob me.¬†But that's seen as raking in pity? I'm having a hard time so this might not seem legitimate. I'm sorry.¬†No matter what I say I get cursed at now.""

That guy who raped you and gave you mono and the one who harrassed you are nothing but filth. 


And you wishing to be friends with the guy who kept harrassing is very common when you're bing abused. I did it too, for some sick twisted reason I wanted to be validated by a person who used to manipulate and abuse me. Your mom is tool too, I guess she has this perfect image of her family of her child in her mind and it shattered once they got to know what happened to you. **Again, it wasn't your fault!** 

Also, I know how hard things have been for you, I am older than you and I don't think so I could have been as strong as you, had I gone through what you're going through. And please don't lose hope yet. See, you can always get into a college. You might not get financial help from your parents but you can apply for loans when the pandemic gets into control. And keep those emails and messages from that pedophile and your b.f. Those are you proofs against them which can help you in the future. 


Your friends telling you the guy who raped was hot or you must be jealous of the girl who was chosen as the valedictorian speaks volume about their common sense and maturity or lack of it. Cut contact with them. Look for some online therapy and try to stay as calm as you can. I know it's a difficult thing but please don't panic.  Pm me if you want to talk to someone. And always remember that you matter‚ù§Ô∏è"
