HuntingGrounds,fqaha0x,t1_fqa9qgm,1589219052.0,"Sage advice my friend. Ur a real dude.

Video games are insanely lucrative nowadays from what I can tell.

I think the passion is there, it just might not be easy to see.

I also think a lot of hardware issues with this game have to do with, well, the hardware.

Imo, it's a very pretty game with a decent sized map with a lot going on.

Idk what size the dev team is, but I'm sure it's not triple A size.

I think they made this game very fast from what I can tell. I literally heard about it close to end of last year, like 5-6 months later, and here it is.

So, basically low man/person power + complicated coding + high density content (every map has x number of unique assests like specific trees, bushes, individual leaves, barrels that explode, mud spots, random veritanium spawns, water physics, etc).

U have given me a lot of new info though/taught me/reminded me a bit.

A lot of it has to do with the suits. (Big buis/biz)

The whole reason I felt compelled to reply was the negative connotation your reply opened with. Like, ""the problem with the gaming industry nowadays"".

I just felt u needed to be told to look at what we have good instead of focusing on the negatives. Cause that's the issue I was trying to describe, wasn't it?

I'm always trying to spread positivity/help ppl.

But on another note, I think the devs did good. It's a fun game. And my fire team dudes are super good looking. I literally wanna play them simply for that reason. Aviators, backwards camo cap, and a bandana mouth guard, with tan skin like me.

This next part ain't on u, but it sucks sometimes to see someone complain about something u see as good."
predator,fqa9e07,t3_gh3e32,1589215148.0,"I like it. But I think it would sort of be a few steps back in how we see the ferocity of the Yautja/Predator.

It'd have to be well executed.

Perhaps show the mother running through places, police or ppl with arms frantically shooting her, and like classic Yautja, she only kills in either self defense or when fighting those with arms or who are dangerous.

And then at the very end show her finally finding her child. But we learn that she was only killing people to retrieve this child or perhaps another Yautja's body.

We can have a classic rando human npc who leads the way and helps the Yautja. And it is this human who finds out what they were trying to retrieve. Perhaps this person could be someone who either works at or gets involved with restricted alien research at a facility.

Otherwise, the point is to drive home that while the Yautja are trained dangerous killers, they are not evil and have motivations similar to humans/everyone else."

HuntingGrounds,fq8lzh2,t1_fq54623,1589169360.0,"Idk why, but I just wanna disagree with u for some reason. At first I wanted to make the point that it was the people that have changed and not the games. But I can see u see that as well.

But now that I remember why I wanted to disagree the second time, it's literally the same disagreement. I'm not sure if u see it or are saying it, but I think the problem is ppl. Not really the games. There are tons of great games nowadays. But ppl can't appreciate them and always complain about the flaws. Remember when 3d graphics were a big thing? Remember when we thought ps2 graphics were amazing?

Ppl just want more and more. They want perfection when they themselves aren't perfect. They don't see the flaws in themselves. Yet they see the flaws in everything they involve themselves with.

Why can't we just enjoy what we have and build on that? Why do we have to tear everyone and everything down? There's a lot of good in the world, but ppl only wanna see the bad and are blind to it when it is in themselves.

This is a great game when u look at all the positives. And the negatives aren't really that bad when you don't expect too much.

Really, a lot of negativity comes from unmet expectations.

(Sorry, I'm just in a place where everyone is super critical of me and my choices, and they try to force me to be a certain way or think certain things when I know way better than them.)"

It's hard to get over someone who's been arguably nothing but nice to you. It's hard to get over someone you can't find a reason not to like, other than people tell you to get over her. And ""she's with someone else.""
