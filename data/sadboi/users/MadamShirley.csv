It was just fun experimenting and learning what people liked. It was also when I began becoming more comfortable with my fondness for group sex. It was also fun having sex with feminine figures."

TooAfraidToAsk,f5vvvct,t3_dpefbz,1572502559.0,"I'm really glad to see something like this brought up, because this kind of behavior is so suffocating. It drives me crazy that people like your friend get upset for being misgendered by strangers but yet completely pass as the opposite gender. I think it's a ridiculous expectation. It sounds like your friend is attention seeking and wants to get upset for the sake of being upset. It's one thing if this is a person you see on a daily basis, but these are complete strangers we're talking about.

I guess the best suggestion here is that if John gets this upset about it, maybe he should gently remind the person of their pronouns. I mean, it sucks to do it all the time but if he continues to be female presenting, you gotta be willing to compromise.

I once got yelled at for literally misgendering a complete stranger. I was told I was the one who was suppose to ask about their gender. I'm sorry but that's not my responsibility. If it's that important, THEY should be the ones to TELL ME, not the other way around. It's such a stupid expectation that really causes others to resent this."
youngadults,f5pl66l,t3_doiug2,1572362005.0,"I've been through this before. My parents forced me into college soon after high school. At first it wasn't so bad but then I slowly realized I didn't want to be here. So I rebelled and kept skipping classes. Then I moved away for school and that made things more complicated since I felt alone. Finally, what fixed the problem was taking a break from school and work minimum wage jobs. I worked in retail part-time and as a page at a library. After about a year of that, I returned to school with a plan and here I am now with a job I like and getting ready to go back to school for my masters in information sciences.

My best advice to give you is to take time off if possible. I communicated to my parents profusely of how much I hated being away. They finally took the hint and let me move back and take a year off. And if that isn't an option, often times schools have counselors to talk to. I never used them myself, but that's an option. Otherwise, I also talked to professors when I was struggling in a class. A lot of them want you to do well and are willing to help. I did this a lot back when I fractured my ankle during college and couldn't do anything on my own. It was causing me to be depressed and suicidal. But, it's because of the kindness of others I made it. I hope it gets better for you, OP. It may seem hard now but it'll work out as long as you keep moving forward."

librarians,ey6xwi3,t3_cvtjzu,1566866551.0,"Public Library:

Like: I like recommending books to patrons and then later on the same patrons return the book and say they loved it and want me to recommend more books. I like doing collection development, being able to make art and crafts all the time (I'm in Youth Services), showing patrons a new valuable skill, going to conferences and meeting more librarians like me, my coworkers are chill, my Director is cool, and I like the hours.

Dislike: I do not like dealing with racist old guys (I work in a small town in Iowa) especially being Hispanic, I also cannot stand doing outreach at the current preschool because the teacher does not have any classroom management skills, I don't like being the only person in my department and relying heavily on extra help from teen volunteers (which is a hit or miss), and not being able to do YA programming because none of the previous YA coordinators before me have stuck around that long to create a steady group of teens."
