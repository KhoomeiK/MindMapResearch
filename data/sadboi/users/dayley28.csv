ImaginaryWesteros,fm7si91,t1_fm7rvm2,1585835821.0,"Criticise? Literally said my opinion that artists sometimes make things bigger then the writer intended. But that’s what art is, it’s the artists depiction fo that particular creature. No need to get defensive? I already said I stand corrected?"
ImaginaryWesteros,fm7s93e,t1_fm7r5e0,1585835663.0,It’s all good I have a downvote button of my own hehe. But yeah I remember seeing a art piece of Balerion the black dread and he was like major major oversized like at lot exaggerated .

AstroGaming,fm7fa8s,t3_ftg6hm,1585824828.0,"It’s to prove your not just lying your brains out and just abusing it to get a replacement. I once ordered a phone case Casetify (a bit different I know) and it arrived scratched to hell so it has clearly been used. I contended them and they told me to destroy it by making a visible gouge down the middle. I then sent them photos and got a replacement. It seemed shocking to me at first but then i sort of understand, it prevents people abusing the warranty system?"

macbook,ffdgtlh,t3_et0klo,1579820564.0,"Honestly no use in waiting all the time. I was this way about the iPhone 11 Pro, I kept thinking I should wait for the notchless phone but coming from a iPhone 7 with battery issues and a cracked screen it was well worth the upgrade to me, as I'm constantly on my phone and similar to you my phone is my entire life. Personally I think it will be a massive upgrade, and the improved keyboard along with the bigger screen would be great for programming as you'll be able to fit more on the screen. If you're still on the fence, you could always just buy the 16"" and see if you like it. If not you can always return it and get a full refund. 

Please feel free to message me if you need anymore help as I love giving advice like this."

AppleWatch,fdvb6l4,t1_fdvarh3,1578745529.0,"Yeah I’m not too worried, it’s just because it’s new I tend to ‘find’ things to worry about. It’s in solid and it won’t come out, just has a little play in it an movement but it’s more obvious on bands such as the sport loop and Milanese, not so much on the Nike silicone one."
AppleWatch,fds9fkb,t1_fds9b82,1578697402.0,Yeah maybe I guess. I’m not too concerned as it makes a click and if never be worried about it coming out. Just sometimes I tend to ‘nit pick’ and find things to worry about. So long as it doesn’t get worse I’ll be fine and either way I have apple care.
AppleWatch,fds92y3,t1_fds8zi8,1578697173.0,"Yeah never put the band in upside down. I was told that the 44mm branding should be on the underside and I’ve stuck to that since.

AppleWatch,fdoh3m7,t1_fdogprv,1578605019.0,Mine never dried off. It’s was annoying because I could see it and it just ruined the ‘seamless’ look of the screen.
AppleWatch,fdog0yy,t1_fdofrk7,1578604399.0,"Fair enough then, I’m not really into traditional watches so it was wrong of me to assume. I think the reason I considered a screen protection is because you interact with the screen more than you would on a traditional watch."
AppleWatch,fdoflsq,t1_fdof8wb,1578604157.0,Because the average person wouldn’t spend $500 on an normal watch.

applehelp,f8bf7dj,t1_f8beq2i,1574435427.0,Yeah well I’m more concerned about the button. It’s annoys me so much. It’s almost like a spring sound on the mute switch and wobble when it’s on mute. Does yours do this?
applehelp,f8bamzo,t1_f8bafh0,1574432074.0,"Yes I agree with you completely it should not happen on a, what I would say, premium phone. No matter how little the flaw is, such as slight creaking and a wobbly button. I am a person who is very attentive to the things I purchase. For example I want my products to be right and if I feel like I have something that shouldn’t be there it annoys me and I feel like my device should be equal to someone else if I paid the same price. Do you think I should take the whole box with me then, with accessories? Thanks for your help I really appreciate it."
applehelp,f8b9our,t1_f8b9e2z,1574431324.0,"Yes well mine isn’t really loud but it’s loud to the point where if I take the case off which I do regularly because I’m obsessed with cases XD, I can hear it and it just sounds cheap and not well built. That and the springy/wobbly sound from the mute switch just makes me very unhappy if I’m honest, enough to try and get the phone replaced. And yes that I true, I’ve never had an issue swapping things out at apple. I remember my old iPhone 6 I had years ago, remember the bending issues they had? Well yeah I baby my phones and mine bent. This happened twice, the first time they replaced it with a new iPhone 6 and the second time this happened, yeah it happened a second time! They actually gave me a brand new iphone 6S because of how much trouble i was having. I’m sure if I am honest with them and tell them how upset I am with the quality, they will give me a replacement, do you think?"
applehelp,f8b8r7z,t1_f8b8m7k,1574430553.0,Okay that’s interesting to hear but not all of them do it because my friends iPhone XS does not do it. I’m still going to try and get a replacement. Do you think they’d give me one because I’m pretty unhappy and in a way if I got a replacement and it did the same thing I’d be more relieved if you get what I mean.
applehelp,f8b7dw3,t1_f8b6d9m,1574429376.0,"Yes I’ll send it to the email. There is two videos, the 5 second one is the mute switch making the loose sounds and the second one which is 7 seconds long is the phone creaking."
applehelp,f8b5lxl,t1_f8b3ew5,1574427721.0,"Yeah it’s just with it having a loose/wobbly mute switch and when the phone ‘creaks’ it just doesn’t feel like a premium device. It’s been 29 days and I won’t be able to make it there tomorrow so I doubt I’ll be able to return it, but If I demand an exchange/replacement and tell them how upset I am surely they’ll oblige right? Even though the replacement will be a refurb probably, I don’t care I just want a phone that I structurally sound and is on the same level of quality of other premium iPhones."

iphone,f599cwv,t1_f590e35,1572077746.0,"Yeah I went with the 256, I’m already filling up 58GB so the remaining amount out of 64 wouldn’t last me for 2 years obviously."
applehelp,f4xf516,t1_f4xemfa,1571865009.0,"But the photos only take up 28GB of storage on my iCloud? And my phone has 200GB spare space so how is it possible not to have enough space? Could it be because I’ve just set up my iPhone 11 Pro and that the photos are still downloading? Also if I click the “download full resolution” option in iCloud photos, will this take time to download as I did a setup from iCloud backup? So do I just need to wait for my photos to download?"
applehelp,f4upuwd,t1_f4tvp7h,1571823281.0,"Yeah I get what you’re saying but you upgraded after only one year whereas buying a phone, for me at least, is a rare thing because I really like to squeeze all of my moneys worth out of it and use It for at least three years. I’m not saying you’re not getting your moneys worth by upgrading every year (if you do) because everyone does different things and enjoys things in the ways that others don’t and I don’t know, I’ve faced that dreaded low on space notification way too much and I don’t know if the spare 30GB left over will last me because I like to buy movies (had to move them over to my Mac because of no space) and I feel like my downloading habits won’t facilitate 30GB or storage."
applehelp,f4tep3y,t1_f4tcbyx,1571787483.0,Okay this might sound dumb but how do you do this? Because I might be able to save my money on iCloud storage if I find out how to do this.

applehelp,f4su69b,t1_f4st990,1571780916.0,I think I’d rather have too much than too little. In terms of the iCloud storage for photos would you keep that? Or stop paying for it and just store my photos on my phone since there will be plenty of space?
iphone,f4sap2e,t1_f4s8h02,1571776036.0,"So do you think based on what I’ve told you I should get the 256GB and cancel ICloud? I have a 32GB 7 at the minute and I’m filling up 28.3/32GB so not much space left at all, and in my iCloud photos, I’m filling 25 out of 50GB. I just don’t know wether it would save me some money by getting the 64GB and upgrading my iCloud to 200GB plan? Or for the long run because I’d been keeping my phone about 3 years get the 256?

iphone,f4s516z,t1_f4s37ob,1571774519.0,"Yeah okay, in fact while you're here can I just ask, if I'm getting the 256gb would you keep the iCloud storage or just stop it and store all the photos on my iPhone since ill have so much space?"
iphone,f4ryq4s,t1_f4rvyl0,1571772828.0,"Well the 200GB off iCloud storage would be £2.49 a month and over 3 years that’s about £90.
