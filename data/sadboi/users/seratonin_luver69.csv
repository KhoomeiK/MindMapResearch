BPD,fgf9ilt,t1_fffk5c6,1580731218.0,"wow that’s so true! I think I’m so used to being loved by someone friends/SO, so when I feel it slipping away i just use my artificial charm to real someone in.I’m actually in a relationship right now but I was more referring to when I’ve been single. I almost play a game with guys, it’s like if some guy tried hanging out with me multiple times I will have excuses the first 5 times and then eventually go, and I do that with ALL of them because it’s to see who will put in the most effort to hangout. Some of them stop after 3 times of my excuses and some just keep on trucking. But I also like the chase if I can tell a guy isn’t interested in me more than a friend.  Why am I like this what the fuck"
BPD,fffd5mk,t3_et2e3b,1579881346.0,I realized i am a complete fuckboy when It comes to relationships. Like I don’t actually care about the people I talk to I just want them for the attention meanwhile I know they’re getting attached to me because I’m playing them but I tell myself “they will be fine”...... but if I stay long enough I get completely infatuated and it’s hard to ever relax. lol I hate It.
offmychest,fdlfgs6,t3_eloypz,1578522883.0,"my dad struggles with this, as i see it first hand I am so proud of you!! you’re doing great. Keep It up"
unpopularopinion,fbe41wh,t3_ecss3r,1576777723.0,"As a women, I completely agree. Sometimes I do things and think to myself how upset and hurt I would be if my SO did that to me. (I don’t mean anything like cheating). But things when I get so upset I don’t control myself. Sometimes I’ll throw something lightly and as soon as It hits the ground I think about how crazy that was. or I might say “shut up” just stupid little things like that. And even though saying like shut up might not seem completely awful, It really is a hurtful thing to say that I would never want my SO to say to me. there is completely a double standard"

relationship_advice,f599ygm,t3_dn1q0t,1572078728.0,"But on topic, tell her how you feel! You work hard for your money. If I was in your shoes I would not be okay with that either. Say what you wrote toward the end of your post, sugar coat It a little so ur not completely  hurting her feelings"
relationship_advice,f599tny,t3_dn1q0t,1572078506.0,Unrelated but what did you get your degree in ? Curious because I’m in college now and want to get a degree I can actually do something with when I’m out
confessions,f2e8kpd,t1_f2dwkua,1570186507.0,"oh I totally agree with you! I think that’s exactly what happened. I just wish he would completely stop drinking but it’s an unrealistic expectation. And that’s also why I can deal with It, now if It was intentional (which no part of me thinks It was) I would be much more traumatized/ mortified.  It’s still gross but I’ve almost completely forgiven him"
confessions,f2dq7ml,t1_f2dpkzt,1570161237.0,honestly I just wouldn’t want to get my dad in trouble. It’s also really expensive. I mean It bothers me but as cliche as It sounds I’m a really mentally strong person and I just don’t think there is anything anyone could tell me that I haven’t already told myself. I kind of want to be a psychologist or therapist myself. I’m too forgiving.
