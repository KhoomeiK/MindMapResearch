Be proud that you did everything you could, and that pain you felt meaning how much he meant to you. You were a good kid, and are probably a good person still. It doesn’t define you, it shows you what you are capable of, the strength to survive those times, and the insight to know it has to heal.  ❤️ bless you"

family,ev49m3n,t3_cidk1k,1564210139.0,"Look, if you are not happy make changes. But do what makes YOU happy and proud. No one else. At the end of the day you look at yourself in the mirror and you have to like what you see. If you allready do then smile and love yourself more. Your mom won’t change because you want her to. And now you can decide how much you want to have her in your life and how much you want to share. Find your power. Find your passions. Embrace the good person you are. Look for ways to be better and more proud of yourself. She may not change but her words won’t hurt so much. 
I have 4 daughters and it was hard to keep my mouth shut and sometimes I didn’t. I hated being wrong and I hated that some of my girls chose wrong. But they grew to be wonderful young women and I’m proud of who they have become. I have made changes because I chose to. But it was hard! Thank goodness they stood their ground and did things their way. It forced me to change to still be able to be in their lives! 
You got this. The first while is the hardest. Do a vision board. Work on building self esteem and self awareness. Set some short and long term goals. Journal. See a counselor . Photo journal your progress. And set a goal date to revisit how you feel about this very Reddit post! You will be so damn proud of yourself. Trust me! Much love to you"
AskWomen,ev2ehob,t3_ci1ii9,1564175414.0,"It’s been about 10 years for me since I spoke to my brother’s other sister. Her husband molested my daughter for years. When I told her she said she, “I always knew”. My question was, “how long have you known and why the hell didn’t you say something?” 
She remained with him for a few more years then they separated but still in contact. The kicker? She’s an rcmp who is trained in interviewing people who have been sexually assaulted.

relationship_advice,ettkom2,t1_ett3cre,1563185211.0,"First of all OP, you are a good father. Which means you are a good man. You are the world to your children. Listen to your instincts, it sounds like you allready made a decision. 
For now, because the children are you g and don’t understand much about adult relationships, put the long-term idea on the back burner. Focus on friendships, because the best relationships are built on that. Another thing, think of a healthy relationship: what does it look like? Sound like? And ask where do the children fit in. Then don’t settle for anything less. Your children need to see what a healthy relationship looks like, so take your time. 
Hug those beautiful babies and trust you are doing the right thing. Never doubt your instincts. Someone amazing will find you:)"

TooAfraidToAsk,esgqn9x,t3_c7ojfy,1561962372.0,"Your own life is always in your hands. To control its end is powerful. Some people think about dying because it’s something they have power over whereas in other areas or all other areas of their life they have no power. 
Also, some people find it “intoxicating” thinking of it. The events leading up to the act, the actual act, the aftermath. 
As long as those thoughts never come to really happen...and just remain thoughts.
I had a friend say, “it is what it is, I’ll leave it up to God but I can still think about it”.
That’s how he accepted his thoughts.
It doesn’t mean you are crazy. But do find a support system, stay away from drugs/alcohol, keep anything away from you that you might think you’d use to kill yourself...like get rid of them! And those times where life just sucks...your partner leaves you, you lose your job, a special person dies those times -you GOT to be more aware of how you are doing and keeping in touch with a support person. 
Keep yourself in check. You can lie to everyone around you but you can’t  lie to yourself. If it’s getting bad and you feel the thoughts are out of control take yourself to the nearest hospital. Tell them what you are thinking of doing. Yes a psychiatrist will see you and that might suck but to live another day is worth it. Who knows what’s around the corner? Keep yourself safe and find a support person."

confessions,esbrb7v,t3_c6rwih,1561807866.0,"In my belief system having “autism” is considered a gift. Any “disorder” “ mental illness”, “diagnosis” is seen as simply that. Instead of working to correct it, we are taught to view the often perceived weaknesses as strengths to another means. Issues with sounds? Meditate. Teach meditation to others. Prayer. See someone to teach him about solitary prayer or ceremony. Issues with touch? Perhaps he is just more observant, therefore that skill of observation should be used to serve others in some way.
Look at his “gifts”, accept and honour him for what he has taught you and teaches others.

seduction,es8cw0s,t1_es80kui,1561693809.0,"In my experience, if I’m looking for a hook up I’m very flirty, casual conversations, lots of teasing/joking, and innuendos. I find a guy who is straight forward but cute/funny in a proposal I’ll most likely hook up with him. Example: flirting with a guy at the bar, offered to buy me a drink (I declined I don’t drink), he then just stated he was going home with me. All he wanted me to do is let him know when we were leaving:) It was straight forward and made me life how he was very sure of himself. Another time I was at a dance and a guy came up to dance with me (I was with my sister in law) and stated “There’s no way I’m letting you leave tonight until I get a kiss, a number or both. I’m hoping for both”. I danced with him the rest of the night. He became a good fwb and we are still friends. 
I think it depends on the situation and the vibes you give off. I’m currently looking for something more long term and I’m not showing interest in these types of scenarios. But I’ve met a few good guys who invite me out or just want to go catch up, get coffee, or take in an event. These are potential long term relationships I’m exploring. 
Idk if that helps:)"
