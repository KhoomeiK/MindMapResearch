AskUK,ffivg3r,t3_etp835,1579983674.0,"I come into Liverpool Street too and walk to work too, my journey is 1hr door to door. Once you get used to it you just accept it but even now I feel 2 hours of my day is gone, because the journey is busy and uncomfortable I canâ€™t use that time to focus on much else. I would say 1hr 40 is a drain on your life, and the fact you are questioning it means you feel it too? 

Does your work offer work from home days? This could take the edge off that long journey if you could be at home 2 days a week? Surely they wouldnâ€™t want a loose a good employee if you say why! Work / life balance!"

I realised about 8 years ago that the more I talk and interact with colleagues , friends  or literally anyone it was one less minute I would be holding internal self assessments on my anxiety! 

Top tip; if youâ€™re ever anxious .. start talking to someone! If your in shop ask the assistant a question about a product, on the train.. ask what stop is next!
Honestly this has gotten me out of so many panicky situations and can make you really confident talking to anyone!"
