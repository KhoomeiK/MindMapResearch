I may go out and record myself walking through a forest, through a busy city centre or on the beach for a couple hours. Then I'll go back and re listen to it and see if I can find any sounds that might work as one shot samples for my music. Walking on a stoney pathway, snapping twigs and branches I find along the way, maybe tapping or banging on stuff that's in the environment I'm in or cars passing me. Could literally be anything. Then I bring them into my DAW and just finesse them to what I need for the mix. 


Other times I take a random object, for example I made a drum kit from all the sounds that I could get from a soda can as I needed metallic sounding percussions for a track I was working on. I like to use samples that are organic and that I created myself in my music just to give it a bit of uniqueness and difference. 

I do sometimes synthesise but I don't really get to much enjoyment from it. I usually o ly do this if nothing I have created in the past works for the track I'm working on."

There's something off about this mutation. But I wouldn't call the numbers fishy this is a new virus and how it attacks people in complete different countries and completely different environments is still to be seen on a grander scale.

As far as the epidemiological principles go you could argue that there are no consistent rates when dealing with an unknown virus mutation. The only previous virus that it can be compared to is SARS but this is on a whole new level. You could then also argue that the principle of Specified Populations comes into play in the fact that every nation will have stronger/weaker immunities to such viruses based on their environment. Their is so much that comes into play with a virus like this it's extremely hard to articulate it correctly in a short paragraph and still stay on point and coherent in presentation of the facts."

A quick Google got me this although it's not the original report I read can't find that one, but contains most of the information I was talking about.

I'm not here for an argument as I feel it's quite pointless in the grand scheme of things. The information you posted is not wrong in any way and provides a lot of valuable information about how this virus works. 

But the information you posted and in the way you posted it can scare a lot of people who won't fact check and will take a random person on the internets word for such things.

Why is their absolutely no way the American people can stop this shit show? The government is clearly corrupt if you can't remove a president from office who was impeached. How have Americans allowed this to go on for so long? I am completely puzzled. Have they all been brainwashed into thinking that their political system is perfect? Do they really think that their idea of a democratic state is unified around the world. If this shit was going on in any European country it would have been over long before it even started. People would be outraged. I honestly don't understand the American ideology that my party is better than yours no matter what. They should come together in this mess and oust as many of them as they can from both sides so that they can actually make some process with politicians who actually care about the people and not about big corporations and money.

So far building castles from sofa cushions and bed sheets has worked a charm. Keeps them entertained for about an hour. Pretending the floor is lava around the castle and that they have to jump from pillow to pillow as to not get burned also takes up another 30 mons.

Arts and crafts is also a huge thing that takes up a lot of time from the day and teaches them new skills. My SO is currently ripping apart old unworn clothes as we speak for them to color on, stick together etc etc.

Over then next few days try everything you can think of and make note of what they enjoy. Then start putting a daily routine together. Write it on a piece of paper and stick it to the fridge or wherever. Rotate things they find enjoyable to alternate days while still trying new activities out so they don't get bored of doing the same thing over and over.

Also just go back to the classics. Hide and seek, Simon says these all take up some time of the day and can be very enjoyable for most kids for 20-30 mind before they get bored

If you wanted, and that's only if you wanted you could set some time aside to teach them something. We have created an at home make shift schooling environment with tables, chairs and a chalk board to improve our children's knowledge of numbers and letters, reading etc etc. Utilise the time to teach the children new life skills suck as reading, writing etc depending on the child's age and ability of course. Keep it challenging but not too challenging to keep them interested and at the end of this chaos the parents will be extremely happy and highly impressed. I once had to leave my 3yo with grandparents for 5 days while travelling for work and when I came back he knew every letter of the alphabet and could count to 20. I was shocked that in so little time he could be thought these things and really opened my eyes to how I could be a better parent going forward.

All in all you are providing those parents with a chance to keep working so what you are doing is fantastic just in that. And kudos to you for being a stand up guy. Many others would never do what you're doing and I feel you deserve a lot of respect for taking care of other people's children I. These trying times and not just looking after the.
