Exactly. A polyamorous relationship is basically a completely normal relationship, just with more than two people in it. They are exactly as loving as any other, but it's not for everyone and that's fine."

In the UK, you get released on bail if you're not deemed to be a threat or a flight risk. An inherently sensible system as it doesn't factor bank balance into risk to Society.

They were exactly like us, and that's what makes Nazism and the far right so terrifying. Nazism didn't arrive in jackboots. It arrived wrapped in a flag, and promises to make Germany great again."
