Slip it in to catch attention and open the door for banter. ""Accidentally"" make direct eye contact, bail from it via a downward look and blush a bit while not inhibiting the flow of conversation. Lean forward on the bar alot. Gentle subtle ego strokes. *my drink is half gone* use the straw to play with ice a bit...Allow him to buy me a drink. 

Plan B: lots of accidental eye contact from across the bar. Smile a bit. Let him the door for conversation is open. *this is my favorite place so i know the bar tender.
