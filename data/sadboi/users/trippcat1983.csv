BPD,fdvfsv7,t3_ehxgxw,1578746999.0,"Sorry this is a late response to your post but, I have been where you are right now and it is not a good place at all, my favourite poison was getting so pissed I'd black out for days while taking all sorts of everything!! I came to a realisation that no friends are worth harming yourself for . Yes the drugs might numb everything and I'm not going to lie they are fun but there is a time when you need to just stop and think about your self worth. For me I have been let down and have let down friends but I do the solo thing 90% of the time just to gather my thought and have found I prefer my own company. If you do need to chat about anything to someone that has had heaps of life experiences that can help you through a few things just message or we can meet for a coffee."
