AsianParentStories,fnix581,t3_g1ptm3,1586987935.0,"I was Seig Heil'd in a Weatherspoons in West London in the Christmas after the Brexit Referendum.  Some dumpy old Caucasian guy whispered it at me as my (Caucasian) husband and our then 6 month old daughter were heading to the pub (I am ethnically Japanese, born and raised in Canada... i.e. I am a native English speaker and haven't been to Japan since '87, when I was 15).

I was shocked and horrified but I chalked it up to being an after effect of the Referendum and I was glad that my daughter was too young to hear or know what those words mean.

If I'd had my druthers, I'd have retorted back... ""Is that the best you can do, Old Man?  You really think that that's going to hurt my feelings or make me want to go home?  I've been called worse than that for lesser reason, so you're going to have to try harder if you want to hurt my feelings.""

I was estranged from my husband briefly last fall (we live in London)... I was looking to separate and eventually divorce.

We'd discussed trying to do the whole thing ourselves to cut costs... we had agreed that he'd remortgage and buy me out of my half of our home and I would return to Canada with our daughter and he would pay child support and have free and liberal visitation... the province of BC \[where I'm from\] has no-fault divorce and proceedings can be started in as little as 1 year after the breakdown of the marriage, provided one of the petitioners has resided in the province for a full year.

I wanted to get some legal advice as to how to proceed, so I got myself a consultation with legal aid just to make sure that I wasn't being screwed by my husband or screwing myself out of anything I might be rightfully entitled to as his wife.  I also wanted to make sure I could take our daughter out of the UK without any problem from UK or Canadian authorities (I am Canadian by birth/British through naturalisation and daughter is Canadian by descent).

About 3 weeks before I was set to leave the family home for good, we had a reconciliation of sorts (this was the weekend before Bonfire Night, on our 7th anniversary) so I didn't need to proceed with plans to leave... I still took daughter and went to Canada (because the tickets were originally purchased for the family to go to Canada for Christmas way in advance and had been changed once when the shit hit the fan and we were unwilling to spend more to change them back to the original travel date) and returned home at the end of last year."

For example, hot water to represent red, lukewarm water for orange, cold water for blue. 

For neon light, I told him to imagine he is looking out of a window on a bright sunny day - he can feel the warmth of the sun on his face but it’s not so hot that it would burn. 

As for pastels, I told him to imagine the texture of corn flour/corn starch... soft and silky.

Brown was interesting... I told him to think what hot chocolate smells like or a partially melted fudgecicle ice cream on  a summer day feels like. 

White was easy to describe... cotton balls and or feathers. 


Some colours are more difficult to describe than others and it was helpful that he and I have had similar experiences (I’m 9 years older than he is and grew up in a different part of the world than he did) so that I could help him try to associate colour with touch and smell."

I did that (dealing the drugs) for a dozen years and even managed to work in the Caribbean for a few years.

Didn't get married until I was 40 (2012) and didn't have my first kid until I was 44 (June 2016).

Yeah, I have had an unconventional life (from an Asian POV) but I can honestly say that I don't regret it.  There have been choices I've made along the way that haven't necessarily been well thought out at the time but I figure that that's part of the adventure and the experience has made me who I am today.

Do I regret dropping out of university?  Hell, no...  I was unhappy there and it was a waste of the university's time and my money (I remember standing in the bookstore line up waiting to pay for my books at the start of 3rd year and asking myself 'do I really want to be here?' and the first thought through my head was ""no, not really"") .Yes, my parents (also Canadian born but with ""old country 'High Expectations Asian Parent'"" leanings)  were pissed when I said I wanted out (both younger bothers were in the sciences and doing well, whereas I was a floundering Artsie Fartsie).. it's not that I couldn't do the work but rather I just wasn't cut out for academic post secondary education at the time... that said, I was able to carve out a  4.0 GPA in pharmacy technician school.

Do I regret waiting until I was 40 to get married? Hell, no.  I wouldn't have been able to travel as much as I did had I been married.  I was resigned to the fact that I probably wouldn't ever get married or have any kids, so I  just got busy living my life and one day my husband came into my life and the rest, as they say, was history.

My parents like my husband (Caucasian guy from the UK) and adore my daughter... even though I didn't finish university and am an utter dunce at math (I had to get my tech school instructor to explain the algebra to me like I was a 4 year old with a lobotomy) they've come to accept how I turned out in life in spite of not meeting their expectations."

Fast forward almost 7 years of marriage (and a lovely 3 year old daughter) and I find out just how selfish/take take take/me me me he really is.  He reconnected with an old school acquaintance at a school reunion back in late June and decided that embarking on an emotional affair with her was a *good* thing to do while pretending to play happy family with me and our daughter.    


I happened to find out about the whole thing quite by accident \[no, I was *not* snooping on his phone... there was no reason for me to suspect anything\] one night at the beginning of August... I saw the iMessage exchange with her on his phone *while he was using the phone* (he is visually impaired and has the phone's speaker up to his ear so he can hear VoiceOver read out what's on the screen) -- he usually has Screen Curtain turned on his phone when he's using it to offer some privacy, but this one time he didn't and while I wasn't deliberately reading his screen, the presence of a string of heart emojis caught my eye and I confronted him about it).  


After we got home and put daughter to bed, he finally came clean about the whole thing and said that he loves AP and won't consider giving her up or trying to fix/save the marriage. 

He spent 3 of the 5 weekends in August with her (she lives in a different city than us) and hours on end in our living room talking on the phone to her in the evenings, while I'm exiled upstairs so they can have privacy (he offers to go upstairs so I can stay down but most nights I'm tired from a busy day with an active 3 year old, so I want to rest in the bedroom).

Suffice to say, we're in the process of separating and I will be taking our daughter back to Canada with me as soon as we can arrange the legalities of our separation.

Please don't be afraid to speak directly to them as you would any other park guest (face to face with eye contact)... their lack of eyesight is just a technicality and while they cannot see you, it doesn't mean that they can't hear you.

Audio recordings are easily done (Small Person is a natural chatter box and likes it when we do video and audio recordings of her) and will be on the 'to do' list.  She will very quickly lose her British accent, so it would be a good keepsake for me as well as for Dad.

Video isn't out of the question as well... husband likes going to the cinema and watching sports on t.v., so the concept isn't foreign to him, and I think it would be beneficial for him to hear her participating in life, even if he can't actually see what is on the screen.

How did it feel?

I'm not going to sugar coat it... the feeling is Scary AF ™. 

  
When I was growing up, I always knew in my heart that if I was ever cheated on, I would leave the relationship.  I didn't know how I'd have the courage to do this (after all, I was just a kid/young adult), but it was something I knew in my heart that I *would* do.

Needless to say,  I never ever in a million years thought that that scenario would ever play itself out, but it has and, at the ripe old age of 47 and with a 3 year old Small Person in tow, I find myself facing the fact my 7 year marriage is over and that she and I are leaving.    


I'm shitting bricks at the prospect (of leaving the family home and current city/country we live in) and having to raise Small Person alone (well, with the support of my family and friends) away from her dad.  I have no job to go to, no immediate job prospects or place to live once we're there (we will stay with my family initially).  


Next to the infidelity that caused this situation  (and all of the hurt and feelings of betrayal that have gone with it) the unknowns of this forced exile is the scariest shit I've known in a long time.

To answer some of the more recent questions you’ve been asking in the comments:

AP knows of both me and my daughter as I was at the reunion with them. 

From what (little) I’ve been told, she knows I’m leaving and that she is partially to blame. 

When it all came out that I found out, husband buggered off  for the weekend to be with her to give everyone “space.” (Gee, thanks... you get to go to her and I’m stuck with our daughter... how is that giving me space?) Apparently she didn’t think it was necessarily a good thing that he went to see her so soon. 

Anyway, things have developed recently (more inconsiderate/insensitive behaviour) that have turned my head/heart (and stomach) and I’m very much looking forward to leaving him, even though I do, at some level, still care about him (a bff reminded me that he and I did have 8 good years together before all of this shit hit the fan). 



I’m feeling stronger today, even though the “continually kicked in the stomach” feeling is still there.  It’s not as pronounced as it was, but it is still there. 

Thank you again for all of your love and support... I feel cautiously hopeful for our future and that brighter days are ahead for daughter and me. We will go home and husband will have to figure out what he will do with his life without us in it."
