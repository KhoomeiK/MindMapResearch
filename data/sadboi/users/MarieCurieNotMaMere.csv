The FIRST thing to do is to find a therapist/psychologist to talk through any muddled thinking you have about what you went through in the past, what you're now going through and how to handle future actions.  
A therapist takes notes which are VERY helpful if you hire an attorney to go after the a*holes creating the hostile work environment, undermining your credibility and destroying your reputation. 
Believe me, I've been there and I leaned on and listened to the experienced professionals of therapist then attorney.
As a matter of fact, my attorney said I had to keep seeing a therapist or he wouldn't take my case."

I've seen wrong patients drawn, wrong transfusion given to similarly named patient, wrong results given for Pos Bld Cult, wrong reagents put on analyzers, lyophilized QC overdiluted...etc...etc..

I grabbed my drawing basket,  redrew patient  and called floor nurse ASAP. Little girl was rushed to ICU then helicoptered to lg med ctr.  They diagnosed HUS and said she would have died by noon if she had stayed at my hospital. Did I rat out those great techs who collectively came to a wrong conclusion? NEVER.
