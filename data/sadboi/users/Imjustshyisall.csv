ADHD,foz5yx5,t1_fowzcsx,1588185247.0,"I work in clinical care, specifically adolescents and can confirm that an ADHD diagnosis is often given to kids that exhibit behaviors that are actually fairly normal for their age. Elimination of recess and physical activity at school, making school days longer (kids sleep less and are required to maintain focus for way too long), and kids being raised by older parents (grandparents in some cases) leads to many people assuming that a child is hyperactive when in reality there isn‚Äôt that much evidence of ADHD at all. 

A diagnosis means that a person‚Äôs symptoms are so severe that they impact every part of their life. Not just 8 - 4, and not just during the school year or workdays. Not just from ages 5 - 10. 

When I meet a kid who can function and is able to keep track of their belongings, get along with family and friends, follow instructions, and handle conflict age appropriately during the summer so they take summers off from ADHD medication, I have to wonder if the diagnosis is legitimate. 

Over-diagnosing hurts everyone, especially the people with the condition. When people say ADHD is over-diagnosed, it can often feel like it‚Äôs being played down or that ‚Äúeveryone is faking it for the Adderall‚Äù. Yeah, some people make blanket statements out of their ass and that‚Äôs an ignorant thing to do.

I do have PMDD though, and a lot of what you say *does* resonate. Particularly - how long your symptoms last (two weeks beforehand), the fatigue, and depression. But, you mention that there are times when you experience high to low mood swings.  The ‚Äúdysphoria‚Äù part of PMDD refers to the extremely low moods many people with PMDD experience. To my knowledge PMDD mood swings tend to range from depressed to anxious to irritated, and don‚Äôt have the high happiness that you describe. 

Some people with mental health conditions will notice that their symptoms go into overdrive in the week before their period. This is called premenstrual exacerbation. It‚Äôs far more common than many people realize and unfortunately not well understood by many medical professionals (as are hardly any ‚Äúfemale problems‚Äù). 

Please note, it‚Äôs not my intention to gate keep or diagnosis you! No matter what, no one‚Äôs period should impact their quality of life in a way that you are experiencing. My advice to you would be to track your symptoms for a few cycles and to be aware of what‚Äôs going on in your life at the time (could anything be exacerbating an already difficult condition?). There‚Äôs an app called Eve that is super helpful for this.

From there, look for a gynecologist that ideally specializes in premenstrual disorders. This can be a tall order, so maybe also try someone who lists ‚Äúsevere PMS‚Äù or even just ‚ÄúPMS‚Äù as something they can help patients to treat.

None of my tips are a hard and fast fix, but they make life a little bit more bearable for me - 

1. Tracking my symptoms. I use the Eve app and it‚Äôs tremendously helpful and affirming that on the days I feel extremely anxious, depressed, exhausted, what have you...I open the app and I can see ‚Äúah, I feel this way *every* day 22 - 25 of my cycle‚Äù or whatever. It‚Äôs really helpful to have that tangible evidence that this isn‚Äôt all in your head, and makes you feel a little less off your rocker. Tracking symptoms is also hugely helpful should you decide to seek further medical treatment, as it‚Äôs the first thing most medical providers will tell someone with PMDD to do. 

2. Exercise. You don‚Äôt have to climb a mountain or go to SoulCycle, but even just a walk around the block or an online yoga class will boost your mood a bit. I love Yoga with Adriene (check her out on YouTube). She‚Äôs got some routines specifically for people who have periods, and others like yoga for depression, anxiety, etc. 

3. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy). This is a process, but regular therapy helped me to accept myself as is. My PMDD isn‚Äôt going away, but it‚Äôs a part of my life and I can prepare for it with what is in my control (eating habits, coping skills, etc.). I have an online therapist (I work in clinical healthcare and even before the pandemic didn‚Äôt keep 9 - 5 hours), and even if it‚Äôs not traditional face-to-face therapy this modality has been hugely helpful. Also, you might look into DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy). It was originally created to help people with low distress tolerance develop greater mindfulness and awareness, and it‚Äôs pretty acronym heavy. Which can make ADHD-ers think ‚Äúno girl, not today‚Äù. But, there are tons of DBT worksheets online that you can do in the heat of the moment and I find that it‚Äôs a good way to get re-centered when my PMDD feels out of control. 

Lastly...I just want to caution you on doubling up on Adderall. It‚Äôs hugely helpful for ADHD symptoms but doubling your dose can actually exacerbate ADHD, and make you more susceptible to anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, and a bad comedown (hello, depression). My psychiatrist added a small, IR dose of Adderall to take during hell week to help boost my mood a bit and lift my brain fog. It‚Äôs not a perfect solution but it‚Äôs helpful. You might want to consider asking your psych if this is a possibility. 

Good luck! Feel free to DM if you want to talk more."
LPOTL,fnw1qak,t1_fnuqf61,1587309645.0,"You're right on about that bad combination.

He's using his platform very irresponsibly and dangerously, and I agree that it's both extremely disappointing and sad to watch. Just really want to echo Henry's sentiments here - there is a lot more going on here that we aren't privy to.

I mentioned this in a different post earlier, but working in clinical care I've seen so many people spiraling and having freak-outs similar to Kissel's as of late. Isolation and quarantine is rough for all of us, but it's a special kind of hell for people who live alone and/or don't have support systems, are struggling with addiction or mental illness, etc. That leads to a lot of people acting in ways they normally wouldn't. But, most of them aren't having as nearly as public of a meltdown as Ben is having here.

I don't get the hate for Kissel that I've seen on here today. He's always come across as a big-hearted dude to me. Sometimes he says problematic shit, but so does everyone else. I get that this is bad, but I think it points to Ben having some bigger personal struggles that many of us weren't aware of. That doesn't make him a bad person, and I hope that he addresses this in addition to getting the help he definitely deserves.

Sending Ben a lot of support in these crazy times, as well as support to Marcus and Henry who are no doubt worried about their friend.

To everyone out there - if you find yourself in a dark place, please know you're not alone. I know it feels so much like it. This won't last forever and we're gonna get through it.

Quarantine and isolation are completely necessary but they can be hell for people who live alone and/or don‚Äôt have an immediate support system, are struggling with addictions, unmanaged mental health issues, etc. We‚Äôre social creatures and isolation with no end in sight makes us act in ways we normally wouldn‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôm in clinical care and we are seeing a lot of people lately who are spiraling in a similar way to Ben for the reasons I mentioned. But it‚Äôs not as nearly public as Kissel and they don‚Äôt have as much to lose.

This is the first time in about a couple of weeks I haven‚Äôt felt profoundly depressed, but I have a feeling that‚Äôs just the trauma response kicking in. I‚Äôm having trouble sleeping through the night. My eyes well up with tears at random times but I can‚Äôt get in the headspace to cry. I skip dinner some nights because I have no motivation to cook. The lack of routine, structure, the no end in sight, the constant chaos and confusion, the questions of how I‚Äôm going to get basic survival needs like food...

I‚Äôm not doing great. The loss factor is hitting my pretty hard. I think the different responses here show how ADHD is different for everyone in a lot of different situations. 

Hang in there all. Someday this will be over."

Have you considered writing your therapist a note regarding the rape and your subsequent struggles regarding intimacy? It's totally normal for people to experience shame, embarrassment, or fear when talking about traumatic events and a good therapist will know this. Writing about it and giving it to your therapist to read is a great place to start. 

Good luck to you!"

PMDD,fmp5krt,t3_fwlyzw,1586274849.0,"I think clinically speaking, dissociation is more connected trauma and severe anxiety.

But dissociation isn‚Äôt indicative of PMDD on its own. Hopefully that makes sense."
therapy,fmk2h51,t3_fvcor5,1586142959.0,"You might start with noticing which situations this happens in. Are you bored or sleepy? In a specific environment? Around certain people? Do certain smells, sounds, or other types of stimuli seem to trigger it? 

Once you understand when this happens, you might start to piece together why it happens. All people zone out from time to time, but some people struggle a lot with zoning out to larger degrees for different reasons. For example, I have ADHD and zone out a lot when I'm bored or doing something mundane. I've experienced the ""blurry vision"" thing and that's usually when I think ""oh, oops...focus"". 

For some people, zoning out can take place in the form of more serious dissociative episodes. Severe dissociation is connected to trauma, which is why I mentioned the zoning out being triggered by certain stimuli, people, or places. If you're noticing patterns there, or feel confused about your identity, or feel disconnected from your body and the world, make sure you talk to a mental health professional. Severe dissociation can be really scary, and not something you should go through on your own. 

Good luck!"

Sometimes the right thing to do is the hardest thing to do. The hurt won't last forever, but know that you're doing the right thing for you and that you deserve better. You really do."
ADHD,fmjzinp,t3_fvpnj4,1586140989.0,"It sounds like you've got a pretty intense crush. 

What stands out to me is that you've never talked to this guy, and seem to be very taken with him. I totally get that. We all get celebrity crushes or get butterflies when an attractive stranger genuinely smiles at us. But, there's a difference between celebrity crushes and butterflies and *really* putting someone on a pedestal. 

Truth is - there's no such thing as being ""perfect"", even in the sense of a person being perfect for someone. You might have totally opposite senses of humor or not ""get"" each other right away even if you do get together. When we put people on a pedestal it makes any let down much, *much* more difficult. And there *will* be a let down because we're all human. That's not a bad thing either. Part of falling in love is knowing that both you and your partner are work in progress, and your relationship gets stronger because of it. 

I can't help but wonder...you refer to yourself as ""my dumbass"" and make mention of being ""thinner and more confident"". Is it comforting to live with this guy in the future? Is there something about the present that's feeling rocky or uncomfortable? Sometimes these intense feelings become a form of escapism. Being present can also be really hard for those of us with ADHD, and building a future reality is how many of us cope with a present that feels mundane, blah, or uncomfortable. 

I hope that nothing that I've said has come across as cold or mean. I'm a grown woman, and I still get caught up in my feelings and crushes and have to remind myself to slooooow down. It's gotten easier as I've gotten older, been to therapy, and learned to be more accepting of the person I am right now. Maybe taking this time to focus on you, you in the present, might be a good way to pass the time between now and Christmas. :)"
ADHD,fmjxujb,t3_fvkinx,1586139936.0,"If I do fidget I'm more of aware of it and can reel it in. There's not as much of that ""must...tap...foot"" urge. My energy knows where to go on medication."
ADHD,fmjxbwo,t3_fvmlef,1586139640.0,"When a person feels rejected, abandoned, attacked, hurt, or insecure, it‚Äôs really hard for them to remain level-headed and empathetic. The feelings I just listed are really uncomfortable and unpleasant, and it reminds you of just how much in your life is out of your control. It‚Äôs only natural that when we feel them, we might try to get rid of them right away rather than accepting them.

For some people, lashing out is the quickest way to regain control (even though ironically, it demonstrates just how out of control a person is when it comes to their feelings and emotions). You can be dominant and scary and get someone else to back off and leave you alone. For the person who is lashing out, it‚Äôs not about the other person‚Äôs feelings any more (hence, what I said about being empathetic). Their own feelings are bigger. Some of these people have a mental illness, some of them are emotionally unintelligent, some of them are struggling with a combination of the two. It‚Äôs almost always driven by insecurity and self-loathing. Their fears mean that they see an ulterior motive in just about everything someone else does, even though there isn‚Äôt one.

None of that excuses the behavior. Someone else mentioned this, but I'll repeat it because it's important for you to know this: it's abusive. Clearly your friend is going through something here. She may not have a choice when it comes to her bipolar disorder but she does have a choice in terms of how she treats you. Plain and simple, she‚Äôs choosing to be mean and intimidating and is showcasing her insecurity by posting it all over social media. This isn‚Äôt about you. This is about her, and her issues (even if she‚Äôs directing it at you).

It‚Äôs really, really baffling to be the target of another person‚Äôs rage when we haven‚Äôt done anything to deserve it. Something really similar happened to me last year and I‚Äôm still processing my feelings about it. When I read your question ""why would someone react so intensely and feel the need to make it known"", you summed up a question I've been grappling with a lot. It hurts so, so, so much, especially when that person then turns around and makes something so painful public. I‚Äôm really sorry that you‚Äôre going through this and wish I could give you some hard and fast formula to make those feelings go away. Unfortunately, this is one of those things where we just gotta sort it out within ourselves. It might always sting, but one day it won‚Äôt sting as much.

My advice to help you get through the next few days (weeks, even) - stay off of social media, or at least disengage with her on any platforms. Unfollow, don't look at her pages. Trust me, it's just going to hurt if you look. Try to limit your processing to only a few people that you can trust - maybe a therapist, if you have one, or a friend who doesn‚Äôt know both of you (mutual friends can ‚Äútake sides‚Äù in these situations, and that can be even more stressful and hurtful). Write her a note that you don‚Äôt plan on sending. You can come back to it and add stuff as you process some more. Cry if you need to. Know that it‚Äôs okay to feel confused and hurt.

She may come back and apologize, she may not. Take care of you right now. You deserve it.

AskWomen,fmjoxfv,t3_fukcgq,1586134732.0,"Yes, particularly when it comes to romantic partners. 

The first man I ever told asked me (I was twenty-one) ""are you sure you didn't just dream it or something?"" This is when I was in therapy and talking about it for the first time, and processing what happened. I was sexually abused as a child and exploring that in therapy was impacting my sex life with him. Before he said that, I even prefaced so much of my abuse with ""maybe this didn't even happen and it was all a dream"" when talking to my therapist. He only said that after I had a panic attack when during sex. Later we broke up because I had ""too much baggage"" for him. 

The second guy told me, to my face, ""So is this your way of telling me you're a really damaged person? Daddy issues?"" We had been talking for a few months. About a week after I first told him, he said ‚Äúyou are damaged‚Äù. 

The third guy was the first person who ever made me feel normal after I shared this with him (we had been friends for a while but eventually became more than friends). He had a pretty rough childhood as well and it meant a lot to me that he didn't treat me like a time bomb. He made me feel like a whole person, and was someone I could be sexual with without feeling guilty or triggered. Unfortunately, he became one of my abusers as well. That's been a tough thing to reconcile. 

The man I‚Äôm dating knows that my family was emotionally and at times, physically abusive. He doesn't know many details, but just that it happened. He doesn't know about the sexual abuse. I don't know how to bring it up and don't know if I want to. He‚Äôs so kind and smart and loving and even-tempered, but the abused child in me says ‚Äúthey all are until they‚Äôre not‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want to believe that. He‚Äôs different, I‚Äòm sure of it. But I‚Äôm not ready to share that part of my life with him."

ADHD,fmc6rrr,t3_fu3p0r,1585939958.0,"In general, it's very healthy for couples to meet each other where they're at, and be understanding of each other's emotional needs. However, that understanding *has* to go both ways. For those of us with ADHD, it means understanding and empathizing with our partner's right for respect, space, and safety. It's not anyone's fault that they have ADHD, but it is their responsibility to mitigate and manage the symptoms of it. 

It's REALLY hard for anyone, especially those of us with a shorter attention span, to maintain a level head during a tough conversation. Combine that with the fact that many of us ADHD-ers grew up hearing that we were space cadets, lazy, and crybabies, it makes perfect sense that ""hey babe, you parked me in again. We talked about this last night, remember? I'm late for work"" can feel more like ""I'm late and annoyed and furious at you"". 

Saying mean and cruel things isn't a symptom of ADHD. It's abusive. Even if you don't mean it that way. Even if you're frustrated. Even if your Adderall wore off hours ago and you haven't eaten since breakfast. Even if you feel like crap for forgetting their mom's birthday and *I know, I know I wrote it down and you texted me about it this morning*. Even if you realize just how mean and cruel that statement is as soon as it comes out of your mouth. Even if you apologize right away (remember that a true apology is changed behavior). ADHD does not give anyone a green light to be mean, and if that's something you recognize in yourself you **really** owe it to yourself and those around you to get professional help. This is a red flag that you're not as in control as you think you are - please don't ignore it. 

 If you're the partner in this situation (if you have ADHD or otherwise), please recognize that you have your own emotional rights as well and this person is not meeting them. Unfortunately this is one of those scenarios where you're making excuses rather than seeing the situation in greater context. This behavior can escalate over time, and it's not on you to manage that behavior. 

I think you raise some good points here, and I respect that when a relationship ends it's important to understand how both parties contributed to  the end of it. But, I can't help but feel like you're falling into the ""be a good girl and know that he's going through a lot"" mindset. I've been there and it took a lot of time on the therapist's couch for me to call it what it was. I loved a lot of things about that man and he has a lot of great qualities, but he also uses his childhood trauma as justification for screaming, threatening, gaslighting, and name-calling. And none of those great qualities or the childhood trauma or the diagnosis cancel out the abuse he perpetuated. 

Hope you're doing okay. <3"
