BipolarReddit,fi034oy,t3_f5mftt,1582024336.0,"Hey there. I hope you are alright once you read this. I know how you feel when it comes down to your symptoms of stress. All I can say is take it easy and take a breather and focus on yourself for awhile. It seems you are putting a lot on your plate right now. Take stuff slowly.

As for the addictions. Try your best to ease off them. They can easily trigger you into a manic state. And I wouldn't wish that upon anyone.

I know I sound like I know what I'm saying but I don't. I'm still learning on my bipolar stuff.

If you need anything, don't be afraid to PM me. I'm usually fast to respond.

Take care."
