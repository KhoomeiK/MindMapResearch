Your friend sounds disrespectful and I would not say something like that to my friend or loved one. It's okay to be sensitive. The world needs sensitive people, too. As long as you can also have a strong, resilient side which allows you to protect and defend yourself. That can be built through self love, meditation, martial arts, counselling, leadership, community service, public speaking, and having at least one loved one around you who affirms your worth and strength."

I have ADD, predominantly inattentive type, and I have really struggled during the quarantine. However, it has also made me use healthy coping strategies like doing more gardening and exercising. I also find the socializing sometimes to be exhausting - especially the needless passive aggressive interactions with some coworkers that can ruin your day. I wonder what would be some healthy strategies to return to the normal state of affairs without erasing the progress you have made. Is it possible to continue doing online classes or to follow a blended model of learning?"

1) What makes Huawei more evil than Apple and Google?   


2) What makes Huawei more evil than our telecom giants Bell and Rogers?

3) China under reported, but Canada is under testing. I know in BC our COVID19 positive cases are probably also double of what our Minister of Health reports, because they only test certain people. I'm sure a lot of countries' reports in six months will be much higher than the numbers they gave during the crisis."

I'm confused about the whole statute of limitations and how that works - I wish there was more recourse for victims.

We receive dozens of reports a day and dozens of messages a week. For context, this subreddit has been moderated from roughly a few hundred members, to 125,000 members over eight years. The mods are active but if something is missed in a single scenario - it doesn't mean the mods are inactive. Also, speaking for myself (u/simmaltree) although I may not post as often but I do read and moderate.

That said, we are happy to invite submissions for additional mods. Will work on something."

Of course it is your choice how you have your wedding, but I'm not sure if a Sikh wedding commissioner would attend and share Sikh teachings at a secular civil ceremony. The Sikh wedding ceremony is the laavaan. Of course, the hymns can be sung and recited in their original form and also translated and explained in English. 

It can be done at any location where you can respectfully have the Guru Granth Sahib ji. It could be done in your backyard so long as there is no meat/alcohol served."
