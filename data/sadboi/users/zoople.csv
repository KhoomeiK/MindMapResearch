Some general snack suggestions

\- Crodino (bitter orange drink)

\- Try the vast array of kinder products (my favourite is Kinder Maxi King)

\- Get a colomba cake (easter is over so you can get these cakes very cheaply!)

\- Lambrusco is sparkling red wine thats quite nice in this warmer weather.

\- Get some grissini (bread sticks) and wrap prosciutto around them

\- Ricotta on toast is delicious!"
