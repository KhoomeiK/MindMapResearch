The transition from seed to pellet can be a slowish process. My Quaker was a baby when I transitioned her from seed to Harrisons and it took a while. I started giving her the pellet by soaking it in juice and mushing it up a bit and slowly diluted the juice more and more while also allowing the pellet to get less wet until she ate the dry pellet. All along though, dry pellet was always available in her cage, and I'd also slowly lessen the amount of seed available  My vet and the techs helped me with the suggestions for the transition.  I also transitioned my senegal from zupreem pellet to Harrison's, but that was a less involved process. 

Good luck, and again, props for taking the steps toward feeding a healthier diet!"

If you’re concerned enough to wear gloves why would you sit in a seat directly in front of another rider when there are other spots available that are physically distant from other riders?  


I get the sentiment, but do you think that the act of wearing gloves is automatically going to protect you while you touch god knows how many surfaces and proceed to eat with those same gloves on?
