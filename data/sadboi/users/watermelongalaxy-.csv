socialanxiety,fqv9dx7,t1_fqv4cy3,1589672522.0,"I guess it doesn’t really matter when you look at the bigger picture, but in certain situations, it sucks feeling like an outsider. Maybe I should just own it."

socialanxiety,fqtcol3,t3_gkfhn6,1589636179.0,"Same. It definitely makes life a lot harder. I swear I’m the most shy and awkward person on the planet. I’m the outsider of my family, I barely have any friends, and interacting with people is excruciatingly hard. I envy people who are outgoing, because they get so much more out of relationships, and life in general."

BPD,fp1dk7k,t3_gaoaxf,1588231965.0,"Well said. People who don’t care about the consequences of their actions are the ones that perpetuate the stigma of BPD. We all need to keep our behaviour towards others in check, as much as we can. I learned that the hard way."
BPD,fos990b,t3_g94512,1588026291.0,Yeah my derealisation is pretty insane right now. I constantly feel light-headed and as if I’m in a dream.
BPD,fojf8gp,t3_g7pnhi,1587819195.0,"You can be more forgiving of yourself. It takes a a lot of practice. But it’s possible. It requires a combination of:

- Fully accepting whatever you did (accepting that there is absolutely nothing you can do to go back in time and change anything)
- Acknowledging that human beings are very very flawed and make a lot of mistakes. Especially damaged humans. There’s a reason/trigger behind all behaviour. 
- Learning from your mistakes (it’s a lot easier to forgive yourself when you are actively trying to change your behaviour and treat others better) 

There’s no quick fix. It’s a process. That you have to keep coming back to."
BPD,fo2wp0c,t3_g5bccn,1587475870.0,"I’m very sorry to hear that. I had a drinking problem myself, up until I started having dissociative episodes every time I drank. I had to stop for my own immediate safety. I think you need a really strong and clear reason for stopping. I know a few other people with BPD that have to stay well away from alcohol, otherwise they completely lose control and their entire lives get derailed. It’s a scary thing when you feel like you can’t stop, but just know that you can. 

I hope you are able to find the support that you need. Feel free to private message me if you need someone to talk to."

BPD,fnrzn9c,t3_g3jf7b,1587207711.0,"An ingrained belief that we are never “good enough”. Usually instilled in us when we are children. People without BPD also experience this, but people with BPD are unable to dismiss the belief, and pretty much live by it. We need to make a conscious effort to intentionally acknowledge the good parts of us, and radically accept the bad parts. It’s about finding a balance."

BPD,fn4axrr,t3_fz7czr,1586637641.0,I have PME (Premenstrual Exacerbation). Which makes any other mental health disorder that much worse. Hormones have a massive effect on the brain. It sucks. Big time.

BPD,fm7n4xc,t3_ftli1i,1585832114.0,"I know exactly how you feel. The fact that you even care if you’re an awful person, means that you’re probably not one. Everyone makes mistakes. Every human being has hurt another human being in some way or another. Please don’t beat yourself up. Trauma has a huge effect on your brain, no matter how subtle it is. Work on forgiving yourself, and figuring out how to manage the disorder as best you can. And don’t forget that you deserve people in your life that empathise with you, and forgive you when you mess up. All the best <3"
BPD,flvqg22,t3_frc9lr,1585529687.0,"Thank you for this. It’s usually a lot easier to distract ourselves from our BPD thoughts by going out and doing things and being around other people, but this situation is making it very very difficult to escape our feelings. There will be a lot of people out there struggling with their declining mental health. Myself included."

I so wish ketamine was an approved treatment for depression. Being on a ketamine trial (in Australia) for a year, literally saved my life. It completely changed my thinking patterns and how I view myself and the world. I really hope more studies are done and it becomes available to people in the near future. I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. I know how hard it can be."
KindVoice,fi02iz0,t3_f5o8oh,1582023525.0,"Happy Birthday!! <3

Just a few ideas I’d like to share with you... 

You have inherent value just by existing... so it doesn’t even matter where you are in life right now. You ALWAYS have value 

No one really knows what they’re doing.... 
“Success” is a social construct. 

You’re still so young!!! You still have potential to do the things you want to do. (Coming from a 29 year old female who still doesn’t know what she’s doing in life)

Everyone does life at a different pace. Things will happen for you when they’re meant to. 

I hope you celebrate you, and being on this earth, and all the wonderful things that could be in your future."
BPD,fhwnz1q,t3_f4xgti,1581922428.0,"Self-awareness is the key to managing BPD! You should feel very proud for taking accountability, as it’s never easy to face up to your flaws and mistakes. The next step would be to forgive yourself, and learn new ways of dealing with relationships in the future. So happy for you :)"
BPD,fhj1r2l,t3_f3gzvk,1581636404.0,Same!!
BPD,fhaoih5,t3_f25rik,1581420892.0,"Despite what your brain is telling you, you aren’t alone, you aren’t trapped. You have options. You have choices. It’s so hard to see outside of the pain you’re feeling, but there IS a whole other world outside of it. You just can’t see it right now.

I don’t know your current situation but I do have some understanding about how you’re feeling. I’ve been exactly where you are. And somehow I made it out the other side. You’ve made it this far. And you should be proud of that. Just see if you can hold on a bit longer and see what happens."
