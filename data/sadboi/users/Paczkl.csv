brasil,fgcj32o,t1_fgaixoc,1580673075.0,"OP, não faça restrição de cálcio!

Por mais contra-intuitivo que pareça, reduzir o consumo de cálcio alimentar aumenta a formação de cálculos pois oxalato fica livre no trato grastrointestinal e precisará ser eliminado pela via urinária, onde ele formará novos cálculos.

O ideal é uma alimentação com diminuição da ingestão de sódio: durante a filtração renal, o sódio que estiver disponível vai ser reabsorvido e acaba levando o cálcio junto. Isso faz com que não tenha calcio livre pra se ligar ao oxalato nos rins e formar novas pedras.

Diminuir a ingestão de proteínas também é importante para evitar a reabsorção do cálcio ósseo que estaria livre pra se ligar ao oxalato posteriormente.

Aconselho a fazer a investigação da sua bioquímica urinária para entender porque você e sua mãe são formadores de cálculos (hipercalciuria idiopatica, hipocitraturia idiopatica, hiperoxaluria, etc). So assim você pode tratar e evitar passar por esse sofrimento novamente."

But I kinda agree with this. There's a real amount of psychiatrists that question the ADHD diagnosis, specially on adult patients. It's quite understandable if you think about how modern psychiatry has been perceived among the medical community.

The DSM V got a huge backlash for the amount of ""new disorders"" and how pretty much anyone can fill criteria for at least one disorder. I personally understand the idea of not letting anyone undiagnosed and that criteria it's supposed to be a tool to guide physicians while their overall perception must prevail.

So tecnichally she's not supposed to agree with OP previous diagnosis, and she was professional enough to keep his prescription despite her own opinion at least at this first moment. And she was also right on suggesting that they should look for a better long term plan than this, as therapy and other type of approaches are usually prefered over medications on many disorders, ADHD included.

Again, I can totally understand and relate to OP's feelings. I just don't agree with how everyone is attacking her"

Migraines are tricky though. Not every type of smoke is a trigger or an aura on my case. Basically, if I smell burnt electric components or plastic, that's my aura.

I'm a smoker myself and have no issues with cigarette smoke or burnt food smell, or the smoke released in different situations like babercues or even surgeries.

So my first thought on this is that it might be an specific herb or even the type of charcoal I've used as I don't get migraines every time. And I also don't feel the need to stop doing so as they're quite bearable episodes than ""spontaneous"" ones.

I also have great benefits from smoke cleansing my house, specially my room, so it feels really really hard to give up on doing so. :(

I'll also give sand a try! Thank you for the advice, I wouldn't have thought about this by myself.

The reason for only working with herbs so far is that it's the only thing I feel like I have the amount of knowledge necessary to do it properly. As I feel like I know what I'm doing because of that, I feel safe and confident, while I think that being insecure would make me second guess myself while doing any other rituals and I'd get on my own way.

Adding to that, I'm at the end of my first year of medical rotations, so time to spend deeping my studies on the occult are scarce and that won't change for a while. So I'm sticking up with what I know as I gradually work into doing other things. I also feel like improving my meditation is crucial before I try anything else as it seems to me that's the basis of magic: getting in touch with your own body and mind and knowing how to use it - and the ritual of burning herbs it's what I feel that helps me most with it.

For me that's not stranger territory, if anything, they're at least acquaintances. She's not a random person he has never heard of.

AmItheAsshole,f38l9rc,t1_f37vicl,1570737570.0,"OP did not referred to his sister as a stranger. He said they're ""not particularly close"". This doesn't mean they never were close or that they will never be.

I'm not particularly close to my mother but that only means I don't keep in touch with her and don't have many feelings towards her. It doesn't mean that when she comes seeking for help I won't do my best (like I've done so far).

My whole point is that OP took a rushed decision when he might had the means to approach the situation differently. If after taking a while to consider all options and tried to reach his sister, he had still made the same decision, I wouldn't think of him as TA (that's why ""slightly TA"")"
AmItheAsshole,f36307q,t1_f3502n9,1570704479.0,"I'd say slightly TA for exact this reason.

OP apparently has no emotional attachment to his nephew or sister which is understandable why he did what he did in a moment of desperation.

But the damage done to this kids life might be permanent. At this age they need a figure of love and care they can trust. OP isn't that person but it'd be far more easy for this children to cope with this moment looking back if he knew he was cared by his uncle (even better if OP could be present in his life on the following years) than not fully understanding why he was kept by strangers while mom was away. This will probably have a huge impact on his future and mental/emotional development and future strugle with mental health is very likely on this scenario for the kid.

As said before, I can fully understand why OP did what he did. But I honestly think it wasn't the best move. OP could have slept on this and waited a while before taking action. OP could have got better informed of his options before deciding to get rid off his nephew.

Not sure where OP is from, but I'll present alternatives based on my own reality fully knowing it may not apply:

- OP could have waited till the morning and called his work, explained the situation and asked for a single day off at least to figure out a better way to handle this situation, get better informed about what kind of benefits he could get from state/social securtiy or other financial help programs his Country might offer in situations like this. Even if he couldn't get any help at all, he could use a day to at least try to find his sister and figure things out with her, tried to understand what the hell was going on and working with her on a possible solution.

- OP could miss a few classes in college without any major outcomes or even took a semester off if he managed to get financial support to afford a sitter during his work hours. Not sure if he needs to pay college tuition and how posponding his graduation would affect that, but it's still a thing he could have considered before doing anything.

- About supplies: ok. This is where OP got me judgemental on this whole thing. Seriously? Ain't there any delivery services around? Ain't there any 24/7 shops nearby? Not even a freaking Uber?

- Felling unprepared: the situation isn't ideal, but OP could have surprised himself with how much he could handle dealing with a 3 yo. They're not newborns that need every single thing done for them, just supervision and a bit of instructions on most tasks. They can talk and tell you what's wrong and what they need, I doubt OP would have harmed this kid in any way.

I'd finally like to say that OP failed his sister in a moment of need. She checked herself into a mental hospital and it's very unlikely she'd be staying there for a long time (again, not sure how things work where OP is from, but the modern take on mental hospitalization is keeping people there the least amount of time as possible). Is not like she was arrested and facing years of charge. It was a temporary situation and I feel lilke OP didn't realized this as he was so caught up on the moment when she took him by surprise."

askdoctors,ezup3cp,t3_d2fv27,1568157703.0,"NAD. I'm actually a medical student and long time psychiatric patient as well.

I've went to your post history and on your previous post comments you were looking for guidance on which approach would be more effective: Your friend desperately needs a psych evaluation.

ER and general emergency services will only work for emergencies (quite obvious, right?). In this case that means if your friend is at risk of hurting himself or others. Based on the info you provided, I don't imagine that applies.

I'm not sure where you are, how much would cost a private appointment or if your friend has insurance. But you could set a direct appointment to a psychiatrist to get him checked. That would be by far the fastest and most efficient approach, avoiding referrals and being mistreated by other professionals.

Antidepressants are tricky. They need a lot of time to work (up to 4-6 weeks even to start it's therapeutical results) and one might not answer properly to many of them. That's why I don't think you should lose time getting check by other specialists. Of course all doctors have at least a basic knowledge of depression treatment, but it's quite hard to find those that know more than the basics other than specialists.

Also, him being on antidepressants for 10 years already doesn't help much when visiting other doctors. Even though many are quite honest and kind and heart, from my experience (as a patient but mostly as a student), they are not really confortable with psychiatric patients and tend to see them as theatrical, lazy, symptoms fakers, etc.

Now, there are many things to consider before making a decision about hospitalization, and they are better left to your friend and doctor to discuss, but I've been through times where I've found that I'd be best off at an institution. Severe depression is very incapacitating and self care is the very first thing most of us that have to deal with it just can't handle. That's why whenever I'm in that place again I wish I had the money to check myself in and just let them make me take my meds and eat and shower. Life gets tricky when your mind is sick like that.


I would also like to appreciate all your concern about your friend. What you're doing is great and admirable, and he is very lucky to have someone that cares around and that's willing to help him go through this. It may sound silly and not that important to you, but most people can't empathize like this and just leave us. Thank you for what you're doing."
askdoctors,ez27upe,t3_czqxg5,1567653291.0,"NAD yet, but I was recently studying the clinical uses of benzodiazepines and here's what I've found out;

· The understanding of how sleep affects our body and health in general it's quite recent. So, after realizing the importance of a good night of sleep, sleeping disorders started to get both medical and public attention as everybody became more aware of it's consequences and risks.

· The first medications used to treat sleeping disorders were highly sedative and had important side effects, therefore there wasn't much bennefit on treating it as the treatment itaelf would significantly compromise the patients quality of life - in most situations, even more than the sleeping problems would.

· It was around 1960 until the first drug (chlordiazepoxide) that would originate the benzodiazepines (class which Xanax is on) was available for clinical uses. In comparison to the other medications, they still had a moderate sedative effect but a lot less side effects and mostly not so severe.

· The benzodiazepines era then starts. Although considered safe to use, as it's still to this day, the lack of information regarding long term effects  as it was such a new drug, associated with good clinical results and patients response to the medication resulted in lots of prescriptions of benzodiazepines. You could considered the excess of prescriptions as ignorance (as they weren't aware of long term applications) or maybe as almost reckless, but the truth is that it was a fucking amazing drug at a time sleep-research was peaking and there was still not many criteria for weather or not medicate those situations (as there aren't that many to this day)

· So mostly, even though we still see benzodiazepines being prescribed without giving the patient the correct information about how long they're supposed to be on this treatment, or even malicious prescriptions as many doctors are not confortable dealing with complains that are mentally related and not exaclty organic, most of the long term users of this kind of drugs are still a result of early uninformed prescriptions. They might not had been prescribed on the 60s but even early 2000 prescriptions could be a result of this.

· Another point to consider is that benzodiazepines are highly addictive drugs that tend to build up tolerance and present abstinence symptoms when withdrawn. So unprescribing benzodiazepines on long term users is a really hard thing to do. Most doctors, even after following the protocols of dose reduction over time, tend to let the patient with the minimal dosage tolerated that not lead to abstinence symptoms.

If anyone have any insght on this, feel free to comment or correct me. It'll be highly appreciated"

depression,eyljjke,t3_cxbnat,1567185946.0,"I do have such moments quite often, but two days ago I had one particularly different.

So, I'm a 5th year medical student, currently doing my psychiatry rotations. So we were in the hospital when we got to see this one patient that used to attend nursing classes at our uni. We were a group of eight and about four or five of my classmates transferred from nursing school to medicine, so they not only new her as had taken classes with her.

She is borderline and was going through a serious depressive episode, so she got hospitalized.

After that, as we headed home, they all started talking about how she used to be before that and how much she changed and seemed to be going through some real bad shit and how they've never imagined something like this would happen to someone close to them. 

Well, it was ok they thought that, almost a natural thought if you think about it. But it felt so weird hearing that and I just couldn't relate. Than I remembered that not every body has to deal with mental illness since childhood and that's why they were so amused about something like that and I was not surprised at all.

And that, as usual, was followed by my ""oh crap, I'm actually very mentally ill"" moment."
BipolarReddit,exq8xqt,t1_expz074,1566499376.0,"I'm also bipolar. I also have been misdiagnosed on the past and faced the consequences of receiving the wrong treatment.

You're absolutely right about how doctors are trained to look for the most predominant disorders and rule them out before consider others.

About having doctors telling you you're not bipolar, I had that happening to me once, after my diagnosed (which was agreed by three different psychiayrists at the time) when I had to seek for public health assistance as I couldn't afford a private appointment at that time.

the part about blame mentioned on my reply is slightly out of context and I do feel it doesn't apply for your situation or OPs (as I don't feel any of that on his post). I literally pasted a part of my reply on another post where I explained why psychiatric diagnoses are trickier than other practices are and why in most cases it can change overtime as we grow a more detailed pictute of sympotms as time goes by.

I'm also in shock about your insurance issue and you're definitely right about how antidepressants are dangerous for people with BP if not associated with mood stabilizers. Not sure where you live, but you might be able to get that changed judicially"
BipolarReddit,exo66cd,t3_ctr7l5,1566470729.0,"I'll just paste here what I've said in another post.

- I'm a medical student and what I can tell you is that the big difference between mental ilness and other illnesses is just that they only realized your brain could be this kind of sick recently, like, a bit over 100 years ago, while other medical practices are centuries years old. Some older than that. So it's all quite foggy and unknown. How most disorders work and affect us are mainly hypothetical and that's why treatment is not that assertive and mostly user dependent. So don't blame anyone over this. Nor you, drugs or docs. 

- Most mental disorders are coexistent because they share similar pathways and areas on our brain, as we don't have a single function for brain areas, they mostly multitask. Same goes for meds as they can't work appropriately selecting which neurons and where to work. Also some dysfunctions can feed up others and that's why diagnosis can change overtime. That's why it takes time and patience to find the right treatment and why one treatment sometimes won't work forever. Also why staying unmedicated isn't recommended as the sicker your brain gets, the sicker it gets itself feeding from its own disorder

I know this doesn't fully apply to what you're asking, but it explains a bit what you're facing. So it's really important to be 100% honest with your therapist and tell him even the things you don't consider relevant. They might be the critical information they need to get you properly diagnosed. Also share that you relate to some traits of BP and see what they have to say about it. You'll get better informed about your situation this way."
BipolarReddit,exo394g,t3_ctlk3b,1566468933.0,"Okay, okay. I've read some replies and what you've said OP. Just hear me out.

- If you feel it takes a lot of energy to find the right tratment and all of that: 

that's exactly why you need to medicate. Of course you might not respond 100% to your first drug combo or whatever you may get prescribed. But I can assure you that even if that happens, you won't need to spend the same amount of energy on finding a better one as you do now, drug-free. Think about that, it's hard now because you ain't taking what's suppose to ease things up.

- If you feel that they should've figured out by now:

 that's just not how this works. I'm a medical student and what I can tell you is that the big difference between mental ilness and other illnesses is just that they only realized your brain could be this kind of sick recently, like, a bit over 100 years ago, while other medical practices are centuries years old. Some older than that. So it's all quite foggy and unknown. How most disorders work and affect us are mainly hypothetical and that's why treatment is not that assertive and mostly user dependent. So don't blame anyone over this. Nor you, drugs or docs. 

Most mental disorders are coexistent because they share similar pathways and areas on our brain, as we don't have a single function for brain areas, they mostly multitask. Same goes for meds as they can't work appropriately selecting which neurons and where to work. Also some dysfunctions can feed up others and that's why diagnosis can change overtime. That's why it takes time and patience to find the right treatment and why one treatment sometimes won't work forever. Also why staying unmedicated isn't recommended as the sicker your brain gets, the sicker it gets itself feeding from its own disorder

- If you feel you're loosing a part of your personality:

not quite. You should face some behavioural changes, yes - the ones that are pathologic will probably fade with medication, and that's one of the reasons treatment is for. But your ideas, opinions, life views are all intrinsec parts of you that you built over time and are always under construction. They won't change unless you don't agree with them anymore. And even if they change, they will still be part of who you are as they were once who you were and that's something  fundamental to creat the idea of someone's self: what you lived and how see that. (Okay, I'm not sure if I made any sense with this, but I hope you get the idea).

- If you woder how better can you get to even consider getting better at all:

There's no way to tell how your life is going to be with or without meds. Statistically (and you can get the idea from the replies over here) the prognostic is: much better with meds, much worse without them. So I'll add up to your statistic sample of replies:

I'm 25 right now. I've suffered from mental ilness since childhood. My earliest memory of suicide thoughts are from the age of 7-8 yers old, when I realised life was harder to live for me than it was to the other around me. It was only at the age of 15 when I felt comfortable enough to complain about one of the problems I had and felt I could get help from it. So I talked to my mom about attention problems and got to a doc for the first time. I've had many major depressive episodes at that age but was quite a neglected kid and no one would never reach out. I kept it all to myself until I was 20 when I was already at college and had a fucking anxiety crise followed by the most debilitating depressive episode until that point. I've abandoned my classes, went home and just did nothing for six months. I was diagnosed by then. It didn't made any sense at that time (it doesn't make full sense yet) so I took my drugs, got a bit better and left them. I was fine for a few months, then another breakdown. That's how my life has been so far. 

I've thought about quitting school, meds, life, many many many times. I can't even count. But when I'm medicated, things are just easier to deal with. I'm up to graduate next year, something that a few years ago, while still reluctant with my diagnosis and life long treatment, I never though I would. But acknowledging my limits and respecting my body has made me realise that I can do anything I want, even if it takes a bit longer then most people do. I'm also on a stable relationship with a very caring and understanding partner that has been my rock during my worst times.

But yes, I'm in big debt because I thought I was ok and could control myself and I'm far behind college schedule because I thought I didn't need help or meds.

So my advice here is: don't be too hard on yourself and don't be too confident and reliant on you either. Those are the things that fucks us up during depressive/manic episodes without us even realising. Things can be a lot easier if you let them to, but can get a lot worse if you don't. The final decision is always gonna be yours, there's no one that can force you to do anything. Just keep in mind that every decision we make today will afect us today but are also decisive on what and how and who we'll be tomorrow."

BipolarReddit,exhoc3d,t1_exh93d5,1566310269.0,"This.

For me, it's just the most basic and simple habits. I force myself to wake up early no matter what and shower. If I do at least that my day gets so much better and easier and I won't feel so bad if I can't accomplish the rest of what I'm supposed to.

It also helps to identify early stages of depression. If I'm struggling to even shower after waking up I know something is wrong and I might start getting worse and worse if I don't seek for help. So it works as a warning sign as well."

AmItheAsshole,ew8mnyb,t1_ew7ydt0,1565211946.0,"I think the problem goes beyond that.

Is bio dad another asshole who wants nothing to do with the kids? That alone for me would be more than a reason to just not adopt them. Fuck him, he has a legal obligation to those kids and should be his priority to provide for them no matter what.

But then, if he's actually a decent person, who's being willingly providing for them throughout those seven years and just fucked up this big once and got into jail, he might consent giving his kids a better life and signing the adoption papers with no problem. But then again, if he knows their mother is married and living a confort life, why not just keep the kids as his and paying child support when he gets out as a way to do what he's meant to? They would live a happy life, with a (we suppose) good dad who's there for them but guaranteeing they would have that money in case anything happens. Or even to help OP to raise the kids he should be raising.

Nah, he should not adopt them and, in my opinion, neither shouls bio dad let him do so."

astrology,er564us,t3_c0f0js,1560518949.0,"When I was touring in Prague the guide told us this clock story...

Apparently there was this king who hired the best clockmaker at the time to make the biggest and the most complex clock ever, as a sign of his wealth and power and that kind of thing. So he did.

After the clock was built, fearing that other rulers would hire the same clockmaker and he would build an even better/bigger clock, he captured him and took his eyes out, so he could never work again. The clockmaker, as wise as he was, instructing one of his apprentices, returned to the clock and destroyed it in a way that only he could ever fix it again.

After that, it took around 100 years until someone could make it work again but it repeatedly broke over time, demanding it to be repared many many times.

It was also destroyed during WWII.

But the thing is that apparently no one has ever managed to fix it completely, which requires manual calibration over time. I might be wrong but I think he mentioned that the moon part needs to be moved from time to time to keep its accuracy

Anyway, that's what I was told and what I remember from it. It was a long time ago and I thought would be nice to share.
