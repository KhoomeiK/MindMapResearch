Conservative,fr50pa9,t1_fr307ll,1589900404.0,"They have been taking care of themselves for decades, it's hugely misconstrued that they take money and benefits when they come here but they don't. Although some in dire situations do, the majority work for what they have and pay taxes on it. Whether you like it or not they make up a large chunk of various industries and without them right now we'd be so much more fucked. I understand your frustration because your family came here legally but as a fellow descendant of immigrants, you have to sympathize with these people they are all here for the same common goal as your parents'. They may not have had the means to fo it legally but they did whatever they could and they are here supporting the economy. Some for 20+ years doing backbreaking work while paying taxes and abiding laws yet not being able to receive benefits and some not even a return on their taxes. Not to mention living in fear of being kicked out regardless of their work and constantly being berated. So if that doesn't show that they have earned at least residency in this country, then I don't know what does. Don't argue this issue while only knowing your parent's story although it's great I commend your parents, but you need to get into the perspective of both sides to truly understand it."

Conservative,fr4z20c,t1_fr4uuw4,1589899556.0,"That's great, I'm all for people that come here legally but we have to accept that illegal immigrants make up a large portion of the agriculture business as a whole. Maybe not Wisconsin, but in all of America. And not all of them are bad some have been here 20+ years and have obeyed laws and paid taxes, I'm all for building the wall, getting the criminals out of here, and reforming the legal process for immigration but those that have been here for decades deserve at least some respect, they are what make up various different industries like agriculture and construction."

However, I was pretty tired I had woken up at 6 am it was 12 pm and I had only gotten 4-5 hours of sleep so I needed the nap but of course this experience ruined the nap haha. I'm just glad I didn't see demons or feel the pressure on my chest as others describe. Hope this doesn't happen to me or to you again. Stay safe man."
Sleepparalysis,fosy0nl,t3_g9d879,1588040427.0,"The same thing happened to me today during a 10-15 minute nap beside the footstep part. Before the nap, I was trying to keep myself up because I was doing something on the computer but I fell asleep and when I tried to wake up I felt awake mentally but couldn't move and my eyes weren't opened yet but I could move my eyeballs. I can describe it as the way it feels when you say ""your leg is asleep"" and it's just numb, I was trying to move like my brain was sending the signals to the nerves to move but I couldn't. And as I started waking up I could feel my body wake up as if the numbness was going away. It started at my fingertips and went up to my arm and to my body and the same with my legs then I fully woke up. It was a weird experience but its the first time I've ever experienced it. Just hoping it doesn't happen again tonight or when I wake up in the morning."
modernwarfare,foi8ghw,t1_fo62d9q,1587780906.0,"Update: I just got into the queue for the chat and all that happens is they ask you for your Activision ID, Gamertag, and console and try to clear the cache.

I was that kid as well I was extremely smart 4.0 student but I just started my first year of college and it's kicking my ass, I know deep down I can obliterate the stuff I'm learning now but something just doesn't let me. I was never taught how to effectively study because I never had to in high school, my school only offered 4 AP classes which is horrible, and in my senior year, I was only taking 3 classes total because I finished all the other classes the school offered.

Also, my senior year of high school I was extremely depressed and I found out depression is linked to cognitive decline(reversible thank god) and I feel like that is what is affecting me now I don't think as quick as I used to and I'm having trouble memorizing material. I'm trying to figure out how to regain those cognitive abilities through meditation, nootropics, and other health-related methods but I'm just at the start.
