For a few weeks I have been on edge constantly, worrying, 100% convinced that I was going to die of a heart attack. There has been a lot of death around me recently and it has really gotten into my head. Last night this all came to a tipping point and I had my first full on panic attack, I was sure I was having a heart attack and called an ambulance, I had to sleep in my dad's bed so that I was close to someone, even though I'm 28. Seeing this sub and seeing that we're all struggling too and seeing that so many people have the same issues has seriously been the most reassuring thing so far, thank you all!"
