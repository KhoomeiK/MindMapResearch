Just a quick question, how exactly did you want your wife to react? 

I’m asking because my bf got so angry with me and how I reacted the other day when he told me the great news that he finally got his badge and graduated as a Houston firefighter.  

I had woken up about 5 minutes prior to his arrival at my house, so I was still groggy. Plus this Houston graduation had been put off so many times because of the mayor and other political BS.  I said “that’s great” and even touched his new uniform and badge. Then I suggested we do dinner. He was so angry that he got his stuff and left. Didn’t even tell me why he was angry till I asked later that night.

I have no idea how I was suppose to react to show that I was proud of him and that I was happy.  I had asked but he wasn’t even sure. He just said I didn’t even sound excited after so many months of him struggling to get to this point. Ugh 🤦🏻‍♀️"
