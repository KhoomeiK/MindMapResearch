depression,fi2x0h6,t1_fi2wj5l,1582091818.0,"Exactly. And I feel like I don't seem like someone who have depression, 19 M, so they're definitely not going to take m e seriously. And that's even if they can understand me, I pretty much can barely talk at this point, my mind constantly freezes during social interactions and I always stumble over words or mumble."
depression,fi176y7,t1_fi171fj,1582051989.0,I  don't know. I feel like I'm in this catch 22 situation where I need help for my anxiety and depression but I'm too anxious and depressed to actually get help.
depression,fi158xe,t3_f5nbbz,1582050887.0,This thought is what has kept me form seeing a doctor for almost 4 years. That and my terrible anxiety
AskDocs,fhn59bd,t1_fhn4f87,1581722137.0,Honestly I've been telling myself to see a doctor for like 5 years now. I feel like it's too late for any of that now. I'm over 18 and from everything I've read online th e NHS brushes off you're problems as nothing once your no longer a child.
AskDocs,fhn3zii,t1_fhmz6pb,1581721663.0,All I really want to know is if it's too late to see a doctor. I'm finding it really hard to do this myself. I'm just afraid of not being taken seriously. I'm a male as and I also live in the UK where the NHS brushes off adults with anorexia like it's no big deal.

NoStupidQuestions,fgsum2w,t1_fgstuk8,1581092988.0," 2 things I'm scared of. 

1. I do have low test but the doctor refuses to treat it. I read the the NHS doesn't like treating low testosterone and the will literally tell you to move on. 

2. I somehow get treatment but now I have to get injections every week and I have to pay."
