The entire process of even finding a mental health professional is so unnecessarily hard. Especially in quarantine.

In my country technically you *can* see a psychiatrist or psychologist for free if your family doctor sends you there. Technically. Because I've been looking and apparently almost no one is seeing new patients during quarantine. And from what I've heard even under usual conditions you would wait months.

I also live in England half time, and I've looked for counselors there. You know how long you need to wait to see a free one there? Minimum 6 months."

I took xanax (also a benzo) and while it wasn't as pleasant as some people have described it, it got the job done. Panic went away and I got so sleepy I feel asleep within minutes (it was nighttime and my sleep schedule is so messed up usually I would've stayed up until morning). So those parts were great. There was some dizziness, light nausea and it didn't 100% take care of my psychosomatic symptom, but at the time I didn't really care about that. This was while taking it at a time when I was panicked but not having a panic attack. 

Before that I took it once during an actual panic attack and I think because of the adrenaline it didn't make me sleepy or lethargic. It literally just stopped the panic attack.

So I would recommend to take either if you're having an actual panic attack, or it's night and you feel somewhat panicky and just want to sleep."

He said that the thing people don't consider is that the two sides aren't currently standing on equal ground. You can't treat both sides equally when there's already a power imbalance, in that case you need to try to weight the scale in favor of the weaker side. So while what the post describes seems hypocritical and maybe it is, what it does is give more representation to an underrepresented side. We have to give some leeway to try to tip the scale.

People *are* supposed to speak the language everyone understands if that is possible. How is that entitlement? Yes she shouldn't stop them from learning, but if they were doing it around her a lot, I 100% see why she feels insecure and left out.

I would agree that she should learn his native language if it was actually his native language, which it isn't. He 'knows it pretty well because of work', and never bothered to teach his kids until they chose to do it themselves because of school. He doesn't sound like he cares about the heritage nor that it's a part of his life. Being a quartet Japanese probably means he doesn't have much Japanese family he might be in contact with, and he never mentions them either. Which means it's unlikely that there are family members the wife isn't able to communicate with.

Also you assume this is happening in America, but believe it or not there are other countries in the world that speak English."

AmItheAsshole,fp64ba0,t1_fp63zay,1588345817.0,"That's true, it really depends on how close you are to that part of the family. I assumed he wasn't close to it because of the way he writes about it."
AmItheAsshole,fp60cl1,t1_fp5z0im,1588343646.0,"Exactly, if it was his actual native language I would agree that she should've made some effort to learn. But he said he's only fluent because of his job, and being a quartet Japanese doesn't seem like much of a heritage either. Not that it's not important to know where your family comes from, but in this case that means that at best he has a few family members that only speak Japanese."
AmItheAsshole,fp5uli1,t1_fp5rt1y,1588340257.0,"It's Japanese not Chinese? Also have you tried learning a foreign language as an adult? And Japanese is one of the most difficult ones to learn for an English speaker. It would take her years even if she worked at it every day.

And I agree it's wrong to ban them from speaking Japanese completely, I'm saying the husband should realise why this might make someone feel insecure so that they can reach a compromise."
AmItheAsshole,fp5txnq,t1_fp5riuz,1588339831.0,Have you ever tried to learn a foreign language as an adult? Especially as dificult one as Japanese?
