Of course, they made some errors as soon as she became the frontrunner (health plan, the Pete wine cave attack) and she generally suffered from the electabilty convo, but overall I think they ran a pretty solid operation that for a mix of reasons -- some her fault, some not -- didn't quite make it all the way."

I don’t have a lot of time for most right wing arguments in general so I tend to largely ignore them, but if they’re making a good faith attempt to express their opinion I’ll certainly listen (actual center-right voters, not MAGA trolls).

The left is sometimes more frustrating though, because I *do* agree with them on broad principle and direction, but even the slightest disagreement with them leads to being called a murderer. Even if it’s literally “well, I’m not sure a wealth tax is very efficient policy wise”, they immediately turn to insults. 

Of course, the leftists who aren’t just Extremely Online hacks with nothing better to do than sit around acting righteous do have some fair thoughts relating to economic inequality or whatever other issue. Them, I’m willing to listen to because it would be productive. 

So it really all depends on the specific person, but if you’re opening argument is “Libtard!!!?!” or “you think a public option is a more realistic and better health care policy? You singlehandedly murdered my grandma and I look forward to seeing you guillotined”, then I have no time for you."
