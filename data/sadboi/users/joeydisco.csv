guitarpedals,fqhv0ku,t3_gizwh2,1589385079.0,What do you think of the hustle drive? Thinking of picking one up. Cool board btw!
offset,fppjibf,t3_geiu5q,1588803429.0,Wow it looks great! I’ve been thinking of getting a j Mascis myself but hate the stock pickguard. Do you have any issues with hum since it’s not anodised like the stock one?
mentalhealth,foj9g4b,t3_g7nad4,1587813609.0,That’s great I really hope it stays like that!
offset,fnf1694,t1_fnf0oph,1586899518.0,"I’ve been eyeing up the j Mascis for a while, I play a jazzmaster myself but never could warm to the bridge or trem. Always have a problem with them even with the mustang bridge I have on rn so the tune o matic on the JM is enticing. Plus I love Dinosaur jr. Have you ever had tuning stability/ intonation problems with yours?"
offset,fney9j7,t1_fnexyvz,1586898059.0,"It seems to me that recently squier have been pumping out some of the absolute best guitars for that price range, especially for gigging. They look and sound amazing! And no guilt. Just took a look at the leaked paranormal series and I want them all!"
offset,fnexkfm,t3_g1707z,1586897706.0,"Thanks for the input guys! I’ve decided to leave it because the idea of a big modding job isn’t too appealing right now, especially for the €250. I’m in no need of a new guitar just quarantine has me browsing new gear non stop ;)it’s like an addiction!"
offset,fnex5uv,t1_fnewmy4,1586897500.0,"Ooh didn’t hear about the upcoming toronado. Might hold out for that so, I’m not in need of a new guitar right now. Thanks for the info!"
offset,fndtupc,t1_fndtclx,1586877382.0,I could probably get the guy down to around 210 or so. The duo sonics are pretty cool especially the HS ones but I can’t get into the colours of the recent ones fender put out :( also I was thinking replacing the bridge pickup in the cyclone could be a good decision.
offset,fndrwg9,t3_g1707z,1586876323.0,"Hey guys, I’m wondering does anyone know anything about these squier cyclones from 2004? It popped up sale on this second hand site for 250 euros, the guy said it was made in Indonesia  in 2004. I’ve never heard of them and if anyone has info please tell.👍"
guitarpedals,fnd4xuk,t3_g08xcm,1586858920.0,"Honestly I think the boss rv 6 is great. Tons of options, can go from subtle verb to ambient spacey sounds, plus the shimmer mode is awesome."
guitarpedals,fnd4px3,t3_g0tmyb,1586858673.0,Sell it and get a boss rv6. I’ve never looked back 👍
guitarrepair,fmfchdh,t3_fuyg3x,1586024370.0,"Hi sorry if I’m doing this wrong, delete if so. I decided to fix up my first guitar (epiphone sg special) to sell today as I’ve played a jazzmaster for the past few years.  After cleaning it down and replacing the bridge, I plugged in and found that while the pickups might work for a while eventually when I switch to the neck the sound cuts out. It actually kindof fades out as if there’s still a bit of noise. This happens to the pickups until it just stops itself or I unplug and plug back in. Does anyone see any obvious problems with the pickup selector wiring (sorry for bad pic) ? Or any other possible fixes for this. Thanks guys!"
guitarpedals,fm7rs6v,t1_fm7rfcv,1585835367.0,"I heard that the tubescreamer has a big midrange bump, so could sound crappy with an amp that naturally has that natural midrange bump. I think my clean channel is pretty standard so I’m gonna try out the blues driver. If that’s not for me could always sell it off and try the tubescreamer!Thanks for your advice"
guitarpedals,fm7mih7,t1_fm7hy8c,1585831629.0,Yeah like a lot of people say the small clone is a better quality chorus sound but I’m concerned that I won’t find a sound for me because of the lack of controls
guitarpedals,fm7avd4,t1_fm5ekw5,1585819824.0,Thing is I can’t afford either of them :(
guitarpedals,fm7aurz,t1_fm79e8i,1585819805.0,"Thanks I’ll take a look at that angel wings pedal. Yeah in the back of my mind I’m kind of thinking it’s a pedal that’s sold hundreds of thousands if not millions of units by one of the most trusted brands out there, so I can’t be going wrong with the ce5 ."
guitarpedals,fm7aq9a,t1_fm6zd7y,1585819664.0,Thanks! So you recommend a tubescreamer over a blues driver?
guitarpedals,fm53heq,t1_fm52gr0,1585765650.0,Yeah the fact that Robert is so partial to boss is really swaying me in that direction. Do you find that the ch1 is at all weak or shrill when playing with guitar?
guitarpedals,fm538kw,t1_fm52n4u,1585765518.0,"I heard about the cs9 and it sounds great but just way out of my price range (I’m seeing them for like 150euros on reverb). Thanks for the ts9 info, I was thinking of getting a blues driver but now I’m considering the tube screamer."
brockhampton,er118qd,t3_c042r9,1560425376.0,You’re really gonna diss BOOGIE like this huh
