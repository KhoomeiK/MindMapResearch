GFD,f979fh4,t3_d3mk5z,1575162298.0,"First off i'm sorry this happened to you. I also hope this comment isn't too late but I could relate to your post. I too had a group of about 7-10 friends, we played everyday for a few years. One day I got the ""leader"" of the group upset (we were basically best friends) over a conversation about a chair. Anyways, all it took was for him to kick me from the Discord and I had basically lost all my friends.

At first I wanted to trick myself into thinking I was fine, but I wasn't. I understand having a group of friends to play with (your's may have differed) is almost magical, I got somewhat attached to this ""group"" and it was what I would do all day everyday, so when I was shut out it took a while for the real emotions to take effect. It threw me into this depression which caused a lot of other mental health problems to arise.

I know what it feels like to be disowned and betrayed by some of your closest friends. It hurts a lot. One thing I've come to learn is that generally there is someone who wants to be the ""head"" of the group, to have power over other people, they may like that.

What should you do? Don't blame yourself as much and just move on (I know generic advice), don't let it get to you if possible, that's what they would want.

Considering it's been 2 months, I don't know how you are currently handling the situation, however I hope you found a little peace so far. For me it's been 2 years and I still have trouble finding friends to play with and generally interacting in games. Time heals though.

I wouldn't take any of this to heart considering i'm just an 18yo, although I figured I would post to let you know that I understand the pain you must have been in/are in. I hope you find your own good way to overcome this burden if not already overcame."
SuicideWatch,f97099d,t1_f96yxal,1575156227.0,"Of course, I empathize with the way you are feeling. I have no problem relating if it could help someone else out. I truly do hope you get better. Let me know if you would like to talk again, I will pin this post to my browser. I cannot promise you that I will respond immediately, but I will try my hardest to keep an eye out on this post. It was a pleasure chatting with you, you seem like a really nice person to me :)"
SuicideWatch,f96yazp,t1_f96wx2v,1575154913.0,"I'm very sorry you feel this way. I didn't mean to upset you in any way shape or form, but just to lend a helping hand. I don't know exactly what you're going through, no one does, and that makes it especially rough. Just know that me, personally, could relate to the things you are going through and maybe in that sense you may not feel alone. However I appreciate your response and respect your decisions. I hope you find what you're looking for."
SuicideWatch,f96w57o,t1_f96tgw5,1575153454.0,"Hey, i'm not going to try to act like I know what i'm doing or saying, but I just wanted to let you know that I could relate to some of this. Being shutout by friends or generally denied isn't the best feeling. I have had times where I have also felt like it was me against the world and I just wanted it to stop. it sucks. I was recently diagnosed with Asperger's, if that means anything. I don't usually socialize or reach out however this post evoked deep empathy in me, I truly care about your well-being, have met or not. If it helps you an any way or not, I want to say I know the feeling of not knowing how things will pan out, or feeling like I couldn't go on. I guess what I really want to say is that although it may not feel like it, you are **not alone, I care**. I truly hope you find some sort of resolution, some answers, some fight. You've made it this far, I **believe** in you. Please try and stay safe my friend. Reaching out is a great thing to do, and I am glad you did."
