I actually ended up not making the varsity volleyball team because I had gotten so weak. For me that was just a huge eye opener, and I realized that in order to live a full life and do the things I enjoyed, I needed to nourish my body.

It can feel intuitive to us that you shouldn't discuss physical appearance but sometimes other people don't get it, and just giving her a reminder could be super helpful. She probably didn't mean to say it in a way that would be upsetting (not that this makes it okay), and with a little communication, you can probably keep her from saying something similar in the future.

EatingDisorders,ffaurf9,t3_eskxfv,1579744958.0,"I’m really glad that she’s comfortable telling you about those behaviors, and it’s incredibly thoughtful of you to reach out on what to do. I think the best advice for what to do will probably come from her, but I can try to give you some insights into what my boyfriend did that helped me!

Just for some quick background I’m recovering from anorexia, which means I have to eat a lot more food than normal in order to gain weight. Sometimes for me I end up making myself sick because I get overwhelmed. Triggers are very different for each person, but for me going out to eat was very hard. At dinners out my boyfriend generally gets suspicious if I leave the table for five or more minutes, or come back with a post vomit look. You can generally tell if someone has just thrown up by the way they look (puffy cheeks, sweaty or a little teary, red face, and they might repeatedly wipe their face). If she’s going to the bathroom in the middle of meals or directly after that can be a warning sign. If you’re at home and you hear retching noises (some people will try to hide them by turning on the sink or shower), that’s obviously a sign as well. 

In general, you should avoid comments on how much she’s eating or her physical appearance in terms of size. It does sound like your partner hasn’t been doing it recently (?) so if that’s the case I wouldn’t worry about it too much, and just make sure they know that you’re there for them if they need you and that they can tell you if they are currently engaging in purging."
EatingDisorders,ffatrgf,t3_eskx69,1579744297.0,"An eating disorder can be many many things, and often tries to convince you it’s not real. I want to assure you that your struggles absolutely qualify as disordered eating, which is alarming and should be addressed. 

I’m very glad you’re seeing a therapist, that’s the first step to healing your relationship with your body and food. I really truly think you should let your therapist know about everything that’s happened and been going on. It’s their job to help you, and quite honestly, lying to them about your health defeats the purpose of going (and wastes the money that is spent on the appointments). 

However, I have absolutely been in the same place. I had been seeing my therapist for more than a year before I admitted to struggling with eating. At that point I was severely underweight and my family had not even noticed. To this day my mother denies that it’s as big an issue as it really is. This is unfortunately often the case with parents, which is why talking to your therapist is going to be very important. Next time you see them bring your phone and tell them you want to read something to them, and read this post to them and let them be on the same page as you. From there they will help you to get to a better place in terms of your eating habits and relationship with your body, which is what you deserve. 

I’m sending all my strength to you! Good luck <3"
EatingDisorders,ffaswg4,t3_eskx8y,1579743727.0,"I think you definitely are suffering from anorexia and likely the reason this is hard for you to accept is the stigma you’ve attached to it. I find it disappointing that mental health issues are seen this way in our society, but maybe you can agree with me that this should change. There’s no reason why eating disorders should be shameful or stigmatized, and reversing that stigma starts with the individuals who are affected.

Your life is very clearly being negatively impacted by anorexia, but I’ve struggled with the same issues of acceptance that you have and I know what it’s like to be in disbelief at a diagnosis. I never starved myself completely, or went days without eating the way I thought “real” anorexics did. However your body needs a lot of calories. For me (a 5’3 teenage girl), my daily caloric needs are like 2500, but for you they’d probably be close to 3000. This means that eating around 1000-1500 can be considered severe undereating for you, which is equivalent to starving yourself in terms of health risks. You said that you’re underweight, you’re eating a low amount, and you’re scared to eat more, and these are very clear diagnostic criteria for anorexia, so I think your doctor is right. 

I urge you to reverse your thinking and accept the diagnosis and suggestions your doctor has given you. It might be helpful for you to find a nutritionist you could meet with who has experience with eating disorders. They can help you develop a meal plan that will prevent the developing of binge eating while returning you to normal eating habits. Reaching out can be scary, but the end result is so worth it. Good luck <3"

EDAnonymous,ff1sadw,t3_er5ow5,1579485061.0,"I had been seeing my therapist for about a year for general anxiety and depression, and I'd been denying my disorder to her, to my friends, my family and myself, and then I realized I couldn't do it anymore but it was terrifying to tell anyone, so I kept denying it for months after that. Then like the week that my junior year started, I broke down and I emailed my therapist at like 2 am and it was something like, I can't do this anymore I'm having issues with my eating, please help me. That was all it took to open communication about it, and although it was scary, it was one of the best decisions I have made in the last year, and with her help, my life has gotten SO much better. 

You could email her beforehand, and let them know what's going on, and I would include pretty much the same information you put in this post. That could be the best thing to do because you can be sure to include all the information (plus you don't have to have the scary face to face interaction of actually saying it), and then when you go into your appointment your doctor can be adequately prepared to help you. If you can't email them, I'd recommend writing down what you want to say on a piece of paper and bringing it with you, and then you can either just read what you wrote or if you end up not being able to bring it up you can give them the paper. From that point, your doctor will likely ask you questions and determine what kind of help you need, and help you with that.

Being anxious is a normal reaction for this situation, eating disorders are like a safety blanket that your mind clings onto, but there is absolutely nothing bad that can come out of telling your doctor. Good luck, and I hope that you get the help you need :)"

EDAnonymous,ff1oug8,t3_er5btn,1579482878.0,"It sounds like you're ready to recover, and it's a totally normal thing to be unsure, scared, and unable to commit, but that's your eating disorder trying to cling to itself and not let you get rid of it. You don't deserve that! You deserve to live a full and happy life, and eating disorders get in the way of that. Recovery is very hard to do alone, so if you do have a therapist or doctor that you see regularly you should reach out to them and ask for help with this. If you're not seeing any professionals (like a nutritionist or an eating disorder specialist) I think that's something you should consider. Having someone in your life that knows exactly what you're going through and can help you through everything and help you stay on track is extremely valuable. 

In order to recover you're going to have to gain weight and you're going to have to eat far more than maintenance, so while working towards maintenance is a good first step, you will have to keep going, which I know is scary. That's why having someone to keep you on track is a good thing.

When I first started working to recover I continued to count calories, but switched all my intake goals from restricting to amount that I would gain at (which was determined by my nutritionist). For me when I have a goal to work towards I'm much more determined to get there, so when I was immersed in my disorder, being under a certain amount would make me feel good, but as I began recovery I forced myself to switch my mindset to getting above a certain amount in order to trigger the same feeling. This might not work for you, but I found counting calories very helpful to be sure that I was eating enough."
AnorexiaNervosa,ff1kggt,t3_er2ts8,1579480631.0,"for me it switches back and forth, like sometimes i love and crave sex, and other times even thinking about being that vulnerable makes me cry. it’s directly related to how much you’re eating because your sex drive goes down when you’re not eating enough, because your body is focused on getting the bare necessities first, so that could be why you have no interest in sex."

my family also has this odd recipe for a kind of bean pizza that’s actually very very good. pretty much you take a regular tortilla and put refried beans on it (we make a big batch of them every few months and keep them in the freezer) and then add shredded cheddar and broil them for about five minutes. it’s super filling and quick and is around 400 calories."
AnorexiaNervosa,fek8fzk,t3_eopccx,1579194782.0,"this happened to me too at the beginning of my recovery journey and it also sometimes still happens when my intake gets upped. one thing that can help is spreading food out over the day. so like breaking up large meals into two smaller meals, and spacing them out a little bit so that your body can digest the food in an easier way. you also want to be sure you’re not doing physical activity after eating because that can be a trigger for vomiting."
AnorexiaNervosa,fek7fjk,t3_ep72cq,1579194178.0,"take baby steps towards it! you can start with eating a snack or having a smoothie with friends or family and slowly work towards a full meal. i find that eating with people that understand what i’m going through and that i really trust helps a lot. it can be tough, but you have to push yourself out of comfort zone a little bit each day. don’t forget that having one slip-up or a bad day isn’t the end of the world. good luck 💓💓"
