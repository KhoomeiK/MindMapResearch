Advice,eytcr03,t3_cyp95e,1567432929.0,"1) If he’s chasing other women then you could talk to him about his flirting, but that doesn’t seem to be the only issue here. 
2) if your boyfriend is complaining about you to your face, comparing you to other girls, then maybe it’s time to reconsider your relationship. If he really cared for you he wouldn’t say such hurtful things out loud. 
3) If you can’t go through conflict with him without fearing a breakup, the relationship may not last long even if you do resolve this issue. 

I believe that everyone should be with someone who is all about them, and I hope you find it. I just don’t think it’s this guy if you can’t talk to him about something he’s doing that’s hurtful."
