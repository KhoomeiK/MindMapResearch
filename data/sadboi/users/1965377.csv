antiwork,fpc47rj,t1_fpbtgs9,1588487056.0,"Yeah man, sure. As I perceive it (and I could be wrong), the problem was the origin of private property. Ever since humans started designating ownership for land, things have gone south (hence capitalism). Because there is no limit to private property, anything can be owned. Having children is only a status thing because we view children as an expansion of property. You own your house, you own your car, you ""own"" your children. They're ""yours"".

But the ACT of having children can never be morally bad. Sure, we could talk about intentions (when stupid people have them just to ""flex"" without actually liking children), but not about the actual act. It's literally the sole purpose of all living species on Earth, to procreate. That's like saying that trees are immoral for growing. Nah, it's nature. Sure, we could expand on how humans are currently bad for the environment and trees aren't, but humans are not inherently bad at all, it's the dirty system we've put in place that is destroying Earth.

Yes, what you've said is true, being born today means being used by many parents as property, wage slaving and having no say in our miserable existences. But the birth of a child is not the evil thing, the evil thing is the social environment that that child has been put in.

These mini-dictatorships you've mentioned are real, but not natural. They're just concepts we've invented and perpetuated because we still fucking suck at organizing as a species. As far as we know, we're the only conscious beings in the Universe, we'll fuck up a lot before finding equilibrium. Good news is, the fact we're having this conversation right now means we're becoming aware of the problem of birthing children as if they are property.

So children should keep being brought into the hellish world that we live in, because it is our duty to make the world better for them. I know not all, but some anti-natalists say we should impose our own extinction, but that's not how it works. We are MEANT to be alive, we can dwell on our life purpose as individuals all we want (I know I do), but biologically the only thing that matters is that we keep moving the species forward. And that means partly having children, but also helping the environment, exploring science, and overall making things good.

We should definitely talk about how much we should embrace having children ONLY if it brings us joy, because that way we're slowly fighting the private property paradigm. But shaming someone who dreams of becoming a father or mother is what's immoral in the first place, because we're shaming human nature.

It is also very illogical to think that ""aw man, we suck, let's all die"" when the cruelty and suffering we experience are completely self-imposed. Like I said, abolishing the birth of humans is like trying to erase the victim to forget the crime.

A horrible human experience is not a given, we're living like this today because we've created a stupid socioeconomic system that is authoritarian, individualistic, and completely out of touch with nature.

Getting into private universities IS already a highly competitive process (least in the US). The only difference from a public education system is that - in the private one - you get into university based on how much tuition you can afford, and not by how much you've studied and prepared.

I don't know about you, but to me poor hard-working students > lazy rich kids, always.

Also, a good public education system does not EXCLUDE the existence of great private universities who will take in anyone who can afford their price. Believe me, the rich have nothing to worry about.

Also, you're talking about people with highly-competitive majors working as baristas. That already happens. What are you saying, then? Let's rob people of a good education because they won't have jobs anyway?

Education is not just about how much money you can make after going through it. It's about giving people from various backgrounds the same opportunity to develop their critical thinking skills and their own identity.

Also, maybe if companies weren't demanding entry-level workers to have a BA, or demanding a Master's degree for someone to work just above minimum wage, we wouldn't have highly talented kids working at Starbucks.

And I, even though I hated every second of university and have been a teacher before (and it was such an uncomfortable experience as I was waaaay out of my element), had the most difficult time saying no and not taking that route, just because other people told me I'd be good at it.

This is one of the most frustrating traits of being an INFP, we are so insecure in who we are/our decisions. I've been kind of in a rut lately and there's this annoying little voice inside my head going ""see, you should have just applied for a master's"", even though I'd rather stay stuck in this rut than do it.

We're crazy, man. In a good way, but still."

There was this one time I was overcharged by a large amount and politely said something so we fixed it, but even then I felt kinda bad for the cashier after the fact lmao"

AskWomen,fdnsinq,t3_em0dan,1578591951.0,"I'm the younger one, and ever since I can remember, my sister would dig through my stuff, read my IM conversations, actually make an effort to find stuff about me that I'd only share with friends, or even personal things I'd write in diaries, pieces of paper and etc when I wanted to vent.

It quite honestly destroyed my trust in others and made me very paranoid about privacy. Our relationship's gotten better after she left our parent's house, but it sure as hell has left its scar on me.

It doesn't help she still has the same behavior and will admit to going through stuff she finds on me online. And that's why I don't tell her shit about my life :-)"

antiwork,fcc2qro,t3_egvz0q,1577593749.0,"I grew up believing in all of this. Lost my youth to years of studying and getting extracurriculars. Thought a ""job I love"" could fix the hollowness inside of me. Whenever I had a job, though, I felt ridiculously mocked. I had definitely been set up. But then, through hopefulness, I would think ""maybe I just haven't found the right job yet!"".

Until finally, this year, I got a job I was actually excited to have, and as soon as I started, I knew I had sold my soul to the devil once again. Turns out I've been fed capitalist propaganda my whole life, and I've prepared to be the perfect employee for most of it. Being the perfect employee gives you nothing but more responsibilities for stupid low wages. Not to mention bosses fucking suck and are fake boot-licking assholes.

Now I'll only serve my knowledge and all of the skills I've gathered over the years to help with the revolution.

Capitalism gets nothing outta me anymore. Nothing. I will proudly remain a fucking loser."
