She’s suicidal but she knows she’d regret it if she did, and she’s tried getting help in indirect ways, like making jokes about it and hoping someone would help her. At least that’s what I assumed because it was ‘deep inside’ (pls don’t guys), so she’s hiding it but also opening up in subtle ways.

Nagito: ‘You need extreme therapy, do you want me to help- or should I.. go?’
