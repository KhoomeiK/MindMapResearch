I struggled significantly with 4th graders and it finally clicked with me that it’s because they are much more like adults. I’m working to move grade levels again. 

Kids, especially very young ones, are very forgiving and easy to interact with in a genuine manner. They are who they are. It’s comforting. 

I found myself especially drawn to the tougher, harder to love kids. I’ll never forget that feeling of finally breaking through and building connections with the kids who everyone else dreaded seeing. In this existence where I often feel very worthless, I knew I meant something to that kid.

You should consider teaching if you’re the same way. Its a tough road, but if you find your niche you can find something for yourself there."
