The last time I did it was when he sat in front of the door begging me not to go so I threw my keys at him and made him bleed and cry..... I stopped doing that.

TellMeAFact,fd4kubr,t3_ejyol1,1578168510.0,"I have frequent nightmares, but the last time I had full-on sleep paralysis was absolutely terrifying. It was morning, and my partner was awake beside me on his phone. I kept involuntarily drifting in and out of sleep. I saw my ex in the room with a gun. I dreamt I was trying to scream or talk or scratch at my partner to alert him but I couldn’t move or make a noise. A few times I woke up for real and could move and asked my partner “is he in the room? He has a gun. I can’t wake up.” He tried to wake me fully but I kept drifting back to sleep. I was sucked back into blackness and deeper into a dark hallway where I was being hunted by my ex. I finally woke up but my whole morning was ruined by sheer terror of the intense reality I had felt. Abusive relationships and sleep paralysis are such a fun mixture!"
