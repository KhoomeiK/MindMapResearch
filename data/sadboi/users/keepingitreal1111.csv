It was the strangest feeling I've ever had. I've also been thinking of people I haven't see for years and them bump into them a few days later it quite strange. I've been seeing the number 11:11 22:22 but alot of mirrored number like 21:12 10:01 I've seen them that many times I even googled it, they say its angel numbers or you are waking up to who we really are, as it's been suppressed and hidden from all of us, we are all spiritual beings with alot more power than we think we have"
