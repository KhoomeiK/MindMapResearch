1. It's a big thing. Smoking is a constant habit and we are always on the lookout of a big thing to get us to stop smoking. It's why we need quit dates or landmarks, and why pregnant women tend to handle quitting a lot better than most people. 

2. Social distancing means we meet our fellow smoker friends less. 

3. Isolation means we're indoors less and it's not so easy to pop by the shop for a pack. 

4. The guilt from being outside, either buying or smoking. 

5. The social pressure against covid-19 spread or amplification. Taking off your mask, bringing your finger to your face, and making yourself more prone to that ventilator? Ew. 

6. Actually a misunderstanding, but yeah, some people will think quitting smoking will up their chances against covid-19, since smoking is one of the main risks among the under 55 population (and more intuitive than obesity etc, albeit for the wrong reasons). 

7. I'm so depressed from the pandemic that I have less energy to dedicate to my withdrawal. 

8. I'm so depressed about the state of the world that a mere cigarette won't fix it, and that sort of helps in a weird way. Normally if I'm not feeling well I'll smoke one and hope it helps (it often doesn't, but I have the hope). Now, I know things are fucked for a very long time to come, nothing will help. 

9. The incoming rece
ssion is scary and definitely adds to the financial incentive to quit.

Went on my first shopping spree yesterday, ended up buying some junk and eating all of it today :<

I used to fast but without anything to do and no concentration for anything I'm just eating nonstop."
AskReddit,fnp1720,t1_fnozfq8,1587137423.0,"I used to eat very responsibly and scheduled everything around my walks... 

Been eating lots of junk and gained 5kg in2 weeks (overate for 3, but weight takes a while to add up). I also spent way more money on groceries smh, because I get too many things just in case I can't go out again.

Edit: I'm in a country where I can't go outside lol. I *was* walking 15k steps/day and meal planning before this happened, hence why I'm upset."

Combined with the fact that she's terrified of guests and hides until they leave (even if they're house-sitting for 2 weeks), and basically no one but me sees her. She's a beauty for my eyes alone!"

Romania,fnhnyp1,t1_fngr193,1586965826.0,"Regula generala cand vine vorba de studiat in afara: Orice om ai cunoscut careia i-a placut experienta avea bani destui, deobicei de la ai lui (nu neaparat bogatani, poate si ei s-au chinuit, dar e considerabil ajutorul si nici nu isi dau seama). Majoritatea nu o recomanda, dar nici nu vor sa recunoasca asta, ca ne-am petrecut ca fraierii ani din viata chinuindu-ne aiurea.

Daca e un efort financiar, nu o fa. Nu te vei distra, te vei stresa degeaba ca esti in strainatate si te chinui mai rau ca in romania, si e o experienta foarte singurateca sa te muti undeva singur oricum, daca mai pui si saracie pe deasupra e de rau. Macar daca ai vorbi limba, ar fi o treaba, dar presupun ca nu stii destula olandeza cat sa lucrezi la supermarket macar. Daca nu vrei sa faci doctorat sau ceva mega specializat (pentru care ar avea destul talent incat sa primesti o bursa), nu prea ai de ce sa faci un BA in afara dpdv al studiilor."
