AskHistorians,fr104jg,t3_gltcnu,1589810604.0,"Everyone seems slim “yet” they eat white rice?

Man, this is like the ultimate example of misinformation in today’s culture. 

Why would eating white Rice make you fat? That makes absolutely no sense. People believe that because they’ve bought too heavily into the “carbs are evil train”  I guess? 

The only difference between brown and white rice is that brown has the fiberous shell still on it which has some vitamins and minerals and some small trace of fiber. So sure, in that sense it is “healthier”, that doesn’t mean white rice is “bad for you” and it certainly doesn’t mean that replacing white rice with brown will make you some how lose weight, or the opposite, that replacing brown with white will somehow make you gain weight. If you thought people eating white rice was a cause of obesity in America you missed the point by a wide mile.

Replace all your brown rice with white rice and you will not gain a single gram."

Guitar,fo391x6,t1_fika0nm,1587482797.0,"already spent months of membership there and made multiple different videos and threads, and had no success.

That said, his channel doesn't have the tools for bluegrass. It focuses on pick slanting and then playing ""patterns"" that have the same amount of 'notes per string"" so you always escape after a downstroke or upstroke. And some people use both. But bluegrass players use neither. They have what he calls a ""double escape motion"" and essentially they are what he calls ""crosspicking"" at all times. he claims people up-slant like david grier because he cherry picks on lick where grier only slants because he happens to be moving from a low string to a high string after a down stroke so go figure it is slanded up, but over all he does not actually slant one way or the other and can play any note he wants at the speed he;s going, regardless of whether it changes strings after up or down strokes. 

Troy wanted me to start ""rewriting"" bluegrass standards and fiddle tunes intoa format where it could be played with one way pick slanting. It was nonsense. You cant improvize around a melody if you're restricting yourself to always playing an even amount of notes per string and only changing strings after a downstroke. You can't play bluegrass like that. You can play asvending ""patterns"". That's no bluegrass. i have spent enough money on that website to no avail.

i also tried learning downward pick slanting on my electric just for the hell of it, but i am physically incapable of doing it. i can't even do simple descending pentatonic sixes in EJ style at more than 105BPM which is what i can cross pick it, so i virtually had zero progress over months of trying. Also posted videos and everything. nothing works. I think i may have brain damage or something. My hand is not capable of picking faster that 105 and it's honestly the most depressing thing because it's the only thing i have in my life that i actually enjoy. i enjoyed spending all the time practicing thinking it would make progress towards my goal of being able to actually play bluegrass, but i see zero progress. hours a day, doesn't matter, zero progress after 1000 hours. sure i made progress learning new vocab and knowing my way around the fret board, but my technical skills are garbage and have no progresses a single bit. And i know people say ""it's not all about speed you can play music without that"".. well, no, you can't if your music is bluegrass. You can't play bluegrass without that technique. I am not asking to be a shredder or play absurdly fast.. just regular medium speed bluegrass. But i think i will never be able to so all the practice i've done has been for literally nothing."

And as good as he is, bluegrass flatpicking is not hard to transcribe (if you can slow it down) because it’s all individual notes and it’s mostly just major or minor pentatonic and the major scale.

Why should the baseball players not be able to capitalize on that if they’re skill generates billions in revenue?

Should sanitation workers be paid more
By the government? Sure. Does this have anything to do with baseball players? No. These types of headlines sound like a naive 15 year old’s idealist world view but they make zero practical sense. Who should get to benefit from the fact that fans are willing to play billions of dollars collectively to watch LeBron James. .... not LeBron?  Should it just all go to the owner?

politics,fkneld0,t1_fklr91s,1584363674.0,"It doesn’t have to be that way, but the media is spinning this entire pandemic as one big anti trump propaganda machine. Like, I am a democrat, I hate trump, he is an evil, blabbering, narcissistic, idiot. But still, I would like to just hear one single topic be covered a-politically. When they approach every single moment of coverage by saying “corona virus is causing problems and trump is president so it’s his fault”, what it does, is cause conservatives to not believe the hype. They think it’s just anti trump propaganda. They think the media is inflating the problem in order to make trump look bad. And honestly , I don’t blame them. How much would you listen when Fox News would spend two weeks blabbering about some major terrible problem Obama caused. You wouldn’t even want to hear it, right?

It is the media’s fault for so heavily politicizing this, which is causing conservatives to not realize that it’s real. 

Yes trump has said multiple stupid things and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Yes, he is only worried about how he looks, about optics, about making sure people think he is doing a good job, as opposed to actually trying to work on the problem. Those are all true. But the media is still over playing their hand by an order of magnitude. Their coverage of this scenario is more about trump than it is about the corona virus. The simple fact is corona virus is an unexpected, very Terrible thing that many countries have struggled to deal with to different degrees, and people are dying everywhere. 

But every headline is see is literally “people are dying from corona and it’s trumps fault “ like holy shit. How do you think a conservative is going to respond to coverage like that. The progressive leaning mainstream media is trying to capitalize on this whole thing to make trump look bad and that causes them to have zero credibility with conservatives. Which also causes Fox News to probably downplay it as well. 

Go scroll through the news reel of reddit mobile right now. Every single headline is about some other problem corona virus is causing and how it’s trumps fault. Every single one. I mean to a certain degree they are almost making it seem like trump literally caused the corona virus. 

You can know how disgusting and evil of a person trump is and still know when your news sources are being disingenuous. No wonder there is so much division in this country. Conservatives cover there ears when progressives say anything and vice versa. And that’s because of THIs Exact type of media coverage which permeates into the minds of those who consume it. so democrats are mostly all regurgitating the bullshit spun talking points of their media and conservatives are mostly all regurgitating the bullshit spun talking points of their media, and as a result both sides can not even comprehend a single word the others are saying. “How can they be so fucking stupid” we all say, every single one of us on both sides.  

I know the right is much worse, and trump is much worse than anything produced by the left. I’m not trying to equate. But I’m just talking about the spin of our news sources which we eat up and which prevents us from being able to communicate with the other side. 

That’s why every single comment thread about the virus , every top comment is about trump. People eat up the bullshit they’re being fed. 

So of course anybody who is wary of “anti trump” propaganda (like conservatives for example), is going to not be taking this coverage seriously. 

I’m so sick of the lack of integrity. I know how bad trump is. But stop trying to deceive me at every single turn into believing some negative outcome that you’ve fabricated into being trumps fault. I know the difference between reality and fantasy. I have enough real instances of trumps behavior to know how god awful he is. That doesn’t change the fact that the corona virus coverage is disingenuous, and a microcosm for everything that has gone wrong in our country - illustrative of the reason why our government has stopped working and is now only two sides working against each other instead of working for the people. It’s because of this bullshit rhetoric from both sides. 

I am not trying to equate the political parties. The have the better agenda in my opinion (because I am progressive), and Republican Party is totally 100% corrupt, and just bought out by whatever lobbies are in their pockets and seek to only benefit the rich and keep down the poor , where as the democrats are trying to change that to a a degree (although I still feel the DNC and the establishment are corrupt, even if not nearly as bad as the Republicans). So in my opinion the democratic agenda is 1000% better for this country and more honest and real and genuine... so I’m not comparing agendas or parties. 

I believe the Republican Party to be literally evil. 

But, I’m just saying, our lefty news sources are ruining this country just as much as Fox News is; and they fucking suck. They are guilty of the same exact problems that Fox News has, but they think they are justified because the lefty agenda has the moral high ground. Maybe it does, but it doesn’t excuse this behavior. 

I can’t stand this country because of this problem. And the “information” that is causing these issues, has now been magnified
By several orders of magnitude, and weapon is, through the growth of social media. And other countries have identified this as a huge weapon and are active playing into it to worsen it. And what does the progressive news media do? Play right into their hands. It’s unbelievable to me."
politics,fkncq4f,t3_fja0h1,1584362126.0,"The reason why is because 90% of the coverage is about how bad it is BECAUSE of trump. Trump may be a blabbering idiot but to cover every single moment of this global incident as a negetivw judgement of him is disingenuous. People get tired of being pandered to, even Democrat’s like me. But republicans see that and they just figure the media is inflating the severity just to make trump look bad. And honestly, the severity is bad, so it’s important we take drastic protective measures, however, the media still is inflating it in order to make trump look bad. It’s just a fact. And that causes republicans to believe the hype less. 

Like , his actual actions aren’t bad enough?? they have to play this constant spin game?. 20 headlines per minute about how trump caused some other corona virus problem or did or said the wrong thing about corona virus. It’s tiresome. 

And it’s made me realize that the lefty media is just a biased and spun as the right wing media. Fortunately it’s not as bad As right wing in many other ways, but just in terms of severity of spin it’s the same thing. Pisses me off as a Democrat that I can’t seem to find an honest news source. Another thing that has opened my eyes to this is the way they cover establishment vs. Bernie with zero integrity. 

Republicans see this shit and they completely ignore it. They don’t believe it. They see it as nothing more than anti trump propaganda. They don’t realize that it’s that too, but it’s also a real threat. 

The problem is that the major news sources in our country have LOST THE TRUST of the AMERICAN PEOPLE , on both sides of the isle now. What a joke it is for me to watch msnbc with my wife for 20 minutes. Like I’m a democrat I should be agreeing with them but they are so full of shit half the time it has me so frustrated.

Like in E blues, over the E you can play E major but when it goes to A, it’s gotta be A major , and to B, B major. You can play E minor pent over all 3 but for major you have to change. Also, learn the shapes of the chords all along th e neck and learn the scales based around those shapes. Focusing not notes in the cord and keeping you hand near that. This will allow you to have stuff “work” more easily. But then you can always just go back to E minor pent. So learn all 5 positions."

politics,fkhx7j6,t1_fkhsziy,1584207664.0,"You have misinterpreted the cdc statistics. 70% getting it is not their prediction if no measures are put in place. It is this exact misleading fear porn journalism that is causing so much ignorance. 

That number is the absolute worst case scenario, the tail end of the belll curve, if No measures are put in place. That means that, assuming no measures are put in place, they run a million simulations and generate a bell curve of possible outcomes (all of which are based on the scenario of zero protective measures). That bell curve has very unlikely scenarios on the left tail (only thousands of infections), most likely scenarios in the middle, and then extremely unlikely situations in the far right tail. Then you take the most far right outcome, the least likely outcome (with the same probability as the absolute best possible outcome on the far left tail : i.e only thousands of infections)... and you report that as “what is projected to happen if no measures are put in place 

That is blatantly purposefully misleading. There is a whole bell curve of possible outcomes that may occur if no measures are put into place and your 190 million number is at the very far end of the tail, fractions of a percent likelihood (even given zero measures are put into place). What they should be reporting is the average simulation result given no measures put into place, not the absolute worst, most unlikely scenario. Everyone has misinterpreted this. The media has purposefully mislead them about it because drama increases viewers and ad prices. You’ve gobbled up a lie."

Documentaries,fkchtn0,t1_fkc0kzk,1584053378.0,"Because some people were born and raised in a city where they grew a career and a skill set and now its hard to find jobs for that skill set in any random cheap place. There are pros and cons to just quitting and moving wherever. It’s not easy to just leave everyone and everything you know, and go in blind to a place where you might end up not being able to do anything other than get a job in the service industry. So in that circumstance I’d be just as poorly off as I am now. The best way out for me, I’ve determined, is to climb a little higher until I can start saving enough to retire early. Or to at least move and have enough of a nest egg to spend time finding the right job. 

I see people say this all the time. “Why not move”. Like, what? How is that possible. I feel like people who are saying that must be so young and not actually have any life experience yet or something. They make it sound so easy like anyone can just up and move wherever they want at any time. It’s extremely difficult to start over from scratch somewhere especially when you’ve sunk years of your life into building up a career that you would be throwing away if you “just moved”."

My entire family is here. My wife is creative director, designer here and would not be able to find work in most other places. We have already made it this far in our industries so for us for the time being, trying to keep climbing the ladder is the best option. But neither of us likes having to live here and we plan and hope to leave one day, but we need to build something before we can do that and even then, it’s not easy to just uproot you’re life and leave everything behind. The idea that we chose to stay here because it’s “cool” and connected is absurd and a total oversimplification.
