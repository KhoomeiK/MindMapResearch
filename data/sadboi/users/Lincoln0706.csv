depression,fopo1fm,t3_g8t6nj,1587966795.0,"People suck. I felt the same at your age. But i didnt realize that i didnt love myself the way i needed to. I also didnt realize there was no rush. 

I do believe you try to love yourself. Have you been dx with depression?

In that case be honest with your therapist. You can say you think of hurting yourself but arent going to act on it. 

I hurt my back and was put on gabapentin. It helped my depression. Maybe you could ask to try that."
depression,fopn5fs,t3_g8t6nj,1587966054.0,"You
Are 19. The best thing you can do is focus on yourself. Dont allow negativity in your brain. 

If you feel you want to be loved, read books on why you feel that way. Learn about yourself to make you healthy. Many many women end up with abusive men and think its love. 

Men do too with women as well but. 

Talk to your therapist about your craving for love-which isn’t necessarily wrong- but if you dont love yourself you will not find it from someone else i promise. 

Love is a great thing. Learn to love yourself. It will take effort, but thats the only way to receive true love in return. 

Id say 80 percent of people struggle with this. Even your friends. Especially your friends. 

Did you ever see a happy person hurt someone?

Hurt people hurt people. 
Remember that. 

You cant change anyone either NEVER

You can only learn to love yourself. Then and only then can you demand the love you deserve."

I wasnt as brave when i was 19."
depression,fopjn02,t3_g8t6nj,1587963242.0,"I understand. I really do. 
Its not that your closest friend doesnt care, he/she doesnt know how to care. Im 41 and still learning that myself. 

First, be proud of yourself. You are still here. You are probably much stronger than your friends (even though it sucks). 

Have you tried things to help?

I didn’t know as much as I do now about bipolar disorder, even if I knew then what I know now, I still thought he wasn’t serious. He functioned very well. He wasn’t manic. 

I transferred to another location and many times I was ready to keep in touch. But I’d say naah he’ll want to get together and due to my mental problems, I was at the time more of a stay home guy.
