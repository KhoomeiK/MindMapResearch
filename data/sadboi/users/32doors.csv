selfesteemsupport,fgzpof5,t3_f0tl8z,1581196427.0,"In my case, it felt nauseating to like myself.

I knew every single flaw that I have, every shitty thing I‚Äôve ever done, and have seen myself at my most unattractive states.

The problem was that I never balanced out my negatives with my many positives internally. I always dismissed them as ‚Äúok‚Äù or minimized them because I felt like if I focused on them I‚Äôd become entitled, complacent, and egotistical.

If you‚Äôre a perfectionist or have high standards you might be used to tearing yourself down as a sort of ‚Äútough love.‚Äù By being your own worst critic you think you can motivate yourself to get better and better.

In reality all you end up doing, especially in the long term, is making yourself feel like shit and start viewing yourself as shit too.

Positive reinforcement is much more encouraging than negative reinforcement. Feeling good about yourself inspires you to achieve more because you feel like you have a solid foundation to build off of. If you think that you‚Äôre worthless, it‚Äôs hard to really believe a worthless person can accomplish anything great, and so you never do.

The solution isn‚Äôt to to always think that you‚Äôre amazing or to become an egomaniac. It‚Äôs to look at yourself objectively, the same way you would a friend, and really ask yourself if you‚Äôd really be so critical to someone else in the same position as you.

If you can treat yourself with at least as much compassion as you would a total stranger than you‚Äôll be able to move forward in life without being your own worst enemy.
