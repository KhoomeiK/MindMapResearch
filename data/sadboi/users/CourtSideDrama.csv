internetparents,filaz30,t3_f88szt,1582497503.0,"Thank you for not pressuring them to go to the police. After I was attacked, I couldnâ€™t bring myself to go to the police. Even now after some time, thereâ€™s no way I could report it. There are very few people who know what happened because I donâ€™t want to be dragged into talking about something Iâ€™m not ready to do. Iâ€™m still working through my own guilt, shame, anger, and a mixture of all of those emotions. 

She was just violated in the most horrific way where she had no control of her body. By not reporting it to police, this may be her way of taking control. It was for me. 

As other redditors have pointed out, her physical health would be important to focus on. Emotional health will most likely take an even longer time. Please be patient with that healing process. 

As for her work, it is concerning that she would face her attacker again and could escalate or repeat. I donâ€™t have any direct suggestions there, but itâ€™s immensely important that she stays away from the attacker. She may want to go back to work because thatâ€™s just routine, she may attempt to push down the event and avoid facing the trauma she just endured. 

Sending her lots of love though. Youâ€™re a great friend."
namenerds,eu1xpyc,t1_eu1ttb6,1563377871.0,"It is unique without stretching too hard for a unique name, imo. I do like those suggestions! Thanks for your input!"
namenerds,eu1xfvv,t1_eu18ltv,1563377688.0,"Thatâ€™s a valid point. Gallagher as a three syllable first name seems to be tougher on the mouth than another three syllable name like William. 
I do love the name a lot though! Thanks for your input!"
namenerds,eu1x2po,t1_eu05um5,1563377448.0,Ooooh I love your creativity! These would be strong contenders for sure! Makes the name Gallagher much more manageable!
namenerds,eu1wt89,t1_eu09jlb,1563377276.0,"Gotcha, thanks for explaining! 
That seems to be the consensus of the responses. Having Gallagher as a first name doesnâ€™t set a nice rhythm for the middle then last names!

My motherâ€™s maiden name is Weston. For a while, that was my top choice for a boyâ€™s name, but itâ€™s gaining a lot of popularity as of late."

It definitely feels like an uphill battle of a name haha"

He did say that he has had pain and dental issues his whole life, so itâ€™s doubtful that this has anything to do with drinking water quality or hygiene practices. Having teeth pulled is not something dentists do on a whim, so OP likely is a victim of circumstance. Regardless- he deserves his smile."

Pole vaulting is a terrifying event.
