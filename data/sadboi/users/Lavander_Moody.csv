You are allowed to choose how you want to spend your free time and she shouldn't tell you off for that. I know you said she is an introvert, but hear me out. You probably are the only adult company she gets, having a child and being pregnant she probably doesn't get out of the house much  and she just waits for you to get home to have any kind of communication. At the end of the day, she loves you and it is painful when your other half chooses to spend their free time with others, especially when you're pregnant and already have a child. Don't forget that she is probably tired af and needs your help.

unpopularopinion,eqa0ctz,t3_bxr4i4,1559922169.0,"I do see your point, however I would not necessarily say it is their ""fault"". Yes, it's not very responsible to get yourself  into a dangerous situation by being too drunk/high or going to a certain area at night, that does increase the possibility, but it's not like the perpetrator is forced to do the crime. There's nothing wrong with safeguarding yourself though and thinking ahead. I once read a story where a homeless girl had gotten into a shower with a man she had met the day before because he told her she can only use it if he is in there with her and he raped her. NO way that excuses his actions, but darling do you really need to shower that bad and there is no other place where you can wash ?"
