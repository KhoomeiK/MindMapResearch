I’d like to remind OP as well as everyone who’s struggling an ED (eating disorder) that as much as others can try and emphasise and learn to be mindful of their comments, at the end of the day, your ED triggers are there because of well, your ED. I hope you seek help because the truth is, we can’t avoid the world or what triggers there might be (other than the obvious self-sabotaging), but we can work ourselves and our perceptions.

the truth is, ed takes whatever your loved one says and twist it into something about your weight and worth when the person who said those comment might have never ever mean or thought that to begin with. 

with that said, OP i hope your wife gets professional help. at the end of the day, we can only support them while they take active steps to help themselves. we aren’t the professionals after all so i’ll say to support her, be mindful of body comments/negativity, and delegate this to the professionals.

2. those who genuinely can’t afford treatment. 
3. those who sought therapy before and it didn’t help or go well. 

if you can’t afford it, i’ll say look into online worksheets and resources. you gotta be diligent about doing the work. people don’t just show up to therapy and leave the room cured after a few session simply by being there. therapy IS HARD WORK. you got to want to put in the work and actually put effort into it. 

and if you fall into the category whose therapy didn’t go very well, here’s what my psychiatrist once said “no one thinks therapy works for them till it works.” and therapist isn’t a one-size-fit-all, they’re only human after all. personality, transference, attitude, expertise all play a part. so if you can, please look for someone else. keep looking till you find your person. and remb that trust takes time to be built, it’s only normal."
