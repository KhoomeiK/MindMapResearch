I was having wild hallucinations and eventually believed I was dead. I looked at my mom and asked what time it was. She told me it was around 3 am and asked why I was asking. I told her to note that that was my time of death. She told me I was alive which I did not believe. I eventually conceded with ‚Äúwell then I‚Äôm in a coma‚Äù.

SandersForPresident,fk66s0o,t3_fgq64q,1583894885.0,"My mom was very reluctant to vote for Bernie because she doesn‚Äôt believe he can win against Trump and that is her biggest priority. I gave her a million arguments and pointed out all the topics she agrees with Bernie on. Nothing was working! Finally, I told her about the numerous sexual harassment accusations coming out against Biden (and none against Bernie though some towards his campaigners). That made her change her mind. She knows I am an assault survivor and she cares about the topic a lot so it was important enough for her to change her mind. 

MY ADVICE FOR CONVINCING YOUR BOOMER PARENT: find the topic they care about the most and show them why Bernie is better."

MakeupAddiction,ewtdejz,t3_cpk5wh,1565742669.0,my only suggestion is to change the way you order the steps because the western eye naturally goes top to bottom and left to right so starting at the bottom corner is not ideal :) consider switching the main picture to the bottom left and then starting the numbers at the top and having them go to the right from there.
MakeupAddiction,ewtd5qj,t1_ewsb9dv,1565742510.0,yellow or peach should actually be used to cancel out purple and blue. you always wanna use what‚Äôs on the opposite side of the color wheel. yellow is opposite to purple and orange is opposite to blue. you use green on pimples because red is opposite to green :)

MakeupAddiction,eqjncpz,t1_eqgpcrr,1560108125.0,i love that even though the purple is relatively dark the color combo makes the look seem soft!
MakeupAddiction,eqjn5d9,t1_eqhfnc8,1560108001.0,thank you so much! i would definitely recommend the cream blush/highlight i used for the glow. it‚Äôs so gorgeous and can be subtle or played up with a highlight on top depending on what you want.
MakeupAddiction,eqjn1ui,t1_eqh60v7,1560107944.0,ooo that would be so fun. that could be a cool night look as well if anyone wanted to do a day to night version of this

MakeupAddiction,eqjmi19,t1_eqiylcj,1560107605.0,i tried to leave the center free of purple as much as i could and then i cleaned it up with some eye primer (concealer could work too) and applied the yellow. then i drew a line down the center with the eye primer and applied the gold :)

MakeupAddiction,eqh2tnb,t3_bydodc,1560047633.0,your face makeup looks great! my only cc on the eyeshadow would be blending a little more on the top edge so you don‚Äôt have such a harsh line.
MakeupAddiction,eqh2oh4,t3_bye0gb,1560047549.0,if you don‚Äôt want to bring the rainbow colors all the way up (since this is your first colorful look that might seem daunting) it could look really nice to have a light brown from the crease up. you have such a nice area between your lid and brow and putting it to use could really elevate your look in my opinion
MakeupAddiction,eqh2gnr,t3_byeabg,1560047424.0,if you post again in the future it would be great to have a little more straight forward angle to see your eyeshadow better! you look great and good luck on your makeup journey!

MakeupAddiction,eqh1okc,t1_eqh034z,1560046960.0,thank you so much! i lost my eyelash glue or else this probably would have lashes haha. and i thought about eyeliner but i think since this is more of a circular halo eye rather than an elongated look i figured it would look cool without. it‚Äôs great to hear that you like it without the two things that usually serve as ‚Äúfinishing touches‚Äù to most looks :)

MakeupAddiction,eqgut2z,t1_eqgmuff,1560043099.0,i feel like that would be a cool variation! more bright and punchy :) i think yellow and purple play off of each other very well because they are complementary (opposite on color wheel) but i think orange could look really fun.
MakeupAddiction,eqg58ve,t1_eqg0l0h,1560031818.0,thank you!! i totally see that now that u mention it :)

MakeupAddiction,eqfpebu,t3_bxzwws,1560024442.0,i think it might be helpful to add a picture of your eyebrows with no makeup because this might be something that can be more easily solved with a little bit of plucking
