I agree. My SO has a great but very high pressure job. I really don't want him to be stuck with housework on top of it. I know I need to see us as more of a team but I have a very unhealthy tendency of getting jealous of him and his success. Because again, I feel like it's the role I'm supposed to take.

AskReddit,fovn5vx,t1_fovkbbi,1588104141.0,"I get really terrible migraines and sometimes I get them suddenly (though usually I don't). I was driving with my friend one day, having a generally good afternoon, and then I started having some migraine symptoms, like aura. I saw something shadowy in my periphery- pretty normal. But it startled me and I thought it was a person walking in front of me. So I swerved, overcorrected, and ended up hitting a tree and totaling my car. 

I got knocked out and so did my passenger. EMS showed up and by then I was awake again but very dazed, having a hard time talking coherently. They noticed some old self harm scars on my arms and then went down a road of being super convinced I tried to kill myself. I didn't though, it really was an accident. 

I end up getting taken to a psychiatric emergency department where I was held for three days for observation. Totally alone. There were literally zero other patients in there, it was super odd. 

After that they alert me that they are sending me to (notoriously bad psychiatric hospital). I freaked out, no one had even had a discussion with me to examine me and I hadn't done anything that warranted an involuntarily comittal. Even being freaked out, I remained calm. I demanded to speak to the doctor who was IVCing me, and he told me effectively he was doing it because I was irresponsible and didn't care I was in an accident.

Which was, firstly, really untrue. Also, that isn't grounds to commit someone. They have to actually be a threat to themselves or others, especially if they've already been under 72 hour observation. 

I should also mention that I wasn't permitted to see a regular doctor or be examined for my head injury during all of this. Which still seems insane to me.

The cops came and drove me across the state to this awful hospital in a paddy wagon. 

Once there I sat for a little under 24 hours in a cramped and tiny waiting room with around 30 other mental patients with no food or bathroom access (we did get some water) or ability to take my medications, as I have bipolar but it is well managed. People started pissing on the floors pretty quickly. We were mostly just locked in and left unsupervised. It was covered in a thick layer of filth. 

I finally got to get evaluated by the hospital counselor. During the interview he made me come up with a way to hurt someone inside of the hospital (even though I had no desire to do or think about doing such a thing) before he would take me to a unit. 

They put me in a unit for people with PTSD (i do have a history of trauma so i guess it makes sense) and all of us were put on the exact same meds, which is kind of odd in such a situation.

Legally they are only able to hold you for an additional 72 hours for observation and if you're not a risk, release you. The hospital policy was to keep people for 5 days minimum. Around that time, I started demanding to go to court to have the IVC order overturned, as is my right. I didn't want to be there for weeks like some people were, I had a life to live.

Suddenly they started changing their tune about letting me leave quickly. They also sent the hospital's attorney to speak to me personally and dissuade me from going to court. 

I got out the next day and went home.

When I started looking through records, it became apparent that the emergency room psychiatrist never actually had me IVCed. He was supposed to have had the legal paperwork filed through a magistrate and follow legal protocols, but it was totally absent. I contacted the court and they had no record of it. My hospital records conveniently left it all out. My records were also full of glaring inconsistencies and recorded statements I know I never made. 

I tried to hire an attorney, who seemed optimistic about it at first, but upon further digging wanted nothing to do with the case and encouraged me to not pursue it elsewhere. So I didn't.

I did a lot more research though and found out this place was owned by a company that had just settled a lawsuit with the federal government and DOD for all sorts of fraud and maltreatment and abuse. So I guess they hadn't really moved past their dark ways."
