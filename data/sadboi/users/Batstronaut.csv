cycling,fn7kx9e,t3_fzxl4g,1586722384.0,"Back in 2018 when I just started cycling for more than just getting to school and work, I used my phone a lot but I found one small issue: they're dependent on a cell connection for any GPS data. That includes speedometer apps. Without that cell connection the data isn't accurate. 

Bike computers have the advantage of not needing a cell connection and figuring out how fast you're going depending on how fast you change position. Instead they use a sensor on the bike itself so it's only dependent on connecting to that. I ride pretty far from home so having something more reliable in rural areas is a priority of mine. I pay for spotify premium so I can download music and not be entirely reliant on cell towers in the area. 

So it all really comes down to how much you ride. 25-100 miles is pretty good warrant for a bike computer I'd say, but if you don't ride far from home you can get away with a smart phone.

The whole time I spent my days sitting at the table, writing sentences. Eventually I think the reason for the punishment had been forgotten, and he just wanted the sentences written.
