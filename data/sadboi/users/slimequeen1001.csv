CPTSD,fqeia3z,t3_gi9uqw,1589308007.0,"This post reminds me of an exercise we did while in inpatient care a while ago. They had us draw an ideal intensive care atmosphere.

So heartbreaking how inaccessible adequate care is for victims of CPTSD."
CPTSD,fq2kq6z,t3_ggedaf,1589057082.0,"It really breaks my heart as well. I spent most of my earlier years either completely mute or loudly overcompensating.

Just goes to show just how much we can depend on no one but ourselves to be saved."

In the past she has expressed remorse for the physical abuse. And I want to believe her. I don’t want to hate my mom as much as I do. I don’t want to think of her as sadistic. I feel like that’s a strong word, but even that feeling confuses me. I‘m worried that every thought I have has been construed by her, by my grandfather, by everyone around me.

My name is Vi, I’m 17 and I’m a sociology and journalism student at the end of my second year in uni. I love writing, reading, espresso and indoor gardening. I also love music — I was studying to be a cellist until the fall of last year, and I sing all over my hometown.  One of my favorite pastimes during quarantine has been emailing back and forth with a few virtual strangers; it’s lovely hearing all the stories they have to share.

ptsd,fohxp5s,t3_g7g1zf,1587774666.0,"BPD and PTSD diagnosee here. I’ve found that above all else you should have a realistic support system. One that understands your disorders, is willing to be frank with you, and is able to set clear boundaries. That balance is hard to get at the best of times, and with turbulent relationships being a factor it seems near impossible. I would recommend a a therapist or psychiatrist first, but if you have a great relationship with a family member or two, they could be a great support system. I have found my treatment team to be an immense support outside of social circles. It’s so refreshing to have them to fall back on when things are difficult. They are also literally professionals in the field, and can set the boundaries necessary for things to remain stable. 

As someone who also struggles with depression, I’ve also found that I do my best when I take things one day at a time. Literally, not thinking about anything beyond the remaining hours you’re awake. Appreciating the little things. Spending time outside. It sounds cliche but it really helps with some of the worse symptoms of either disorder. 

I wish I had better advice for you, but unfortunately I’m kind of in a similar position to you. Should you want to, I would be happy to chat with you further. It can help to have people who can sympathize with your symptoms. Regardless I wish you all the best. BPD was a difficult diagnosis for me to receive and honestly all that helped me accept it was time. I hope you keep us updated :).

ptsd,fohvzer,t3_g7dzt1,1587773714.0,"I was diagnosed with CPTSD this past year after only some physical abuse that ultimately hasn’t impacted my psyche but an entire lifetime of emotional and psychological abuse that has seriously deteriorated my entire sense of self. That shit fucks you up. Im still struggling with the guilt, too, but I try to remember that invalidating my own suffering does not lift the suffering of another. What you went through was traumatizing. Diagnoses don’t just happen. You are worthy of treatment and recovery.

BPD,foheega,t3_g7dt1n,1587764549.0,I agree. Having a set “end goal” is just too much pressure. All that’s helped me is taking things one day at a time.

CPTSD,fnolzyj,t1_fnjdjun,1587128652.0,"Thank you for your reply. I really appreciate everything you’ve offered to me. 

My father does not see what my mother did to me as abuse. He enabled it, in some ways. Growing up, both of my parents would hit me and my sisters,  but my mother was a manipulator as well. My father just doesn’t see it at all, and refuses to acknowledge the destructive nature of her comments. He just tells me to brush it off. He has convinced my sister of the same. My sister’s feelings toward my mother for the abuse have manifested in aggression and anger, instead of depression and dissociation (as in my case). She has also been sort of brainwashed by my mother into believing that I am just dramatic and over emotional, and that it has nothing to do with my mother. 

I have started the X effect calendar, counting down to May 19, the end of my semester in school. School has been a major added stressor for me. Although it’s only been a brief time, I have felt some relief being able to focus on one date in the future and seeing that it gets closer as time goes on. Thank you for the suggestion.

CPTSD,fnolh6z,t1_fnjas03,1587128281.0,"Thank you for your comment. It is helpful to hear from someone who both has had a similar experience with family trauma and is also studying to be an expert in mental health. I hope you have been well. 

My parents don’t directly pressure me into telling them about therapy. They just make backhanded comments about me being “secretive” or lying to them. Sometimes my mother brings out her insecurities on me — when I tell her “I’d rather keep that between me and my therapist,” she’a been known to say something like “Oh right, I forgot, you can’t trust me because I’m just an abuser. Sorry!” and veil it as a joke. She knows I already feel immense guilt for the negative feelings im having toward her, and uses it as fuel against me. My father just gets mopey. And I know he’s not trying to hurt me, but it really bothers him that I don’t feel comfortable telling him things and I hate hurting him. Usually I can rationalize that these are manipulation tactics and think my way through them, but I really just don’t have the energy to risk hearing these things right now. Im worried that I will spiral."

KindVoice,ff8ve5m,t1_ff85yh9,1579697389.0,"Thanks for responding! This is pretty cohesive, idek where to start. 

 I take meds for my depression and psychosis but they don’t really do much. I’m trying to figure this out with my psychiatrist but weve been trying for years so I’m tempted to just stop them altogether. It’s a pointless expense at this point. 

I feel like people don’t like me because I have some serious RBF, only instead of looking like a bitch I just look angry or really sad. I’m lethargic and have trouble keeping my energy up while hanging out with people for long periods of time. It’s something I’m working on. I’m socially awkward at first, so first impressions with me are never great.

I’d say that I’m generally pretty interesting. If I had to describe my look it’d be like pretentious blipster or something. I’m not very concerned with the superficial stuff of image. I just don’t think I’m very bland. I work as a barista and I love it, especially the talking to customers thing. I find that the depressed feeling comes when I’m not really doing anything or when I see people my age enjoying themselves while I’m busting my ass to get by. 

I’m hoping to adopt a cat once my finances are more in order & I can better take care of a living animal, but for now I spend a lot of time walking my neighbors dogs for them and parent a few houseplants. 

I use dating sites but the issue of age always comes up at some point. I am at the age of consent in New York but it’s not likely that the people I interact with would feel comfortable meeting up with me off of Tinder or something. I’m also a lesbian so finding other out WLW in my age group is borderline impossible; everyone is either in the closeted or trying to get a funny story to tell their friends."

I figure it’s just easier to say I’m okay and go through the motions than go through another med change or be institutionalized again. I am trying to get out of this pattern of thinking, but it’s hard work & as such I can totally see the difficulties of your situation. 

I guess what I try to keep in mind is that your team exists to help you with your treatment. As such you can begin to think yourself past any guilt you might feel in asking for “more” help. No request you make should be seen as a burden by any of them, because everything they offer you (insofar as your recovery) should be in your best interest exclusively.

I was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago and through therapy learned that my mother was the main source of my symptoms. Having doctors  and therapists approach her with this news was understandably terrible for our relationship and things got worse. She could not accept that her daughter had mental illnesses at all let alone that she had caused them. 

Essentially I don’t tell her anything. She wouldn’t believe me even if I tried, and I have. It’s terrible to have your symptoms denied. Makes you doubt yourself even more than you already do."
