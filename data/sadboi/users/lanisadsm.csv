Regardless of their intentions, you would think as a 31 year old adult you would have enough maturity to rise above the situation #1 because you’re at arguably the most important day of your sister’s life and #2 because these people are now your family of sorts.   hmm idk, did you have too much to drink? just trying to think of an excuse on your part for speaking like that to people. in no way is that okay, it would maybe be acceptable if they were saying cruel things but it seemed clear to me, and to you, there’s a cultural difference and tbh even without a cultural difference (from how you tell the story) it would be clear enough that the occurrence was nothing short of civil."
