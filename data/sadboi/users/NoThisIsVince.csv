I can't speak for individuals whose tuitions are hitting $150K+, but there comes a point where the money, while important, takes a back seat. Hopefully, it doesn't scare off too many future PTs.

In regards to paying for school. Obviously, it depends on what your tuition is and everything. However, I think it's safe to say that you 110% will have to take out loans to pay for school. It's inevitable. The way I did it - I saved up enough to cover my first two months of rent and any other expenses on top of it. I was also extremely persistent with my school's FinAid in regards to loans and when they would be dispersed. Try your best to make sure that your focus is on school! I know it's difficult, especially if money is tight. I think given your situation, research what loans would be best for you to take out. If you wanna think of it this way, you're paying now to bank on yourself later on in life, once you start practicing PT.
