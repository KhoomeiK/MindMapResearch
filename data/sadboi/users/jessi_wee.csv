depression,epwvteh,t1_epsw4cy,1559585910.0,"I took up skydiving. Something about hanging out of an airplane 2.5 miles above the ground with 140mph wind in my face calms my brain. It's the only time I can separate myself from depression. It takes 100% of my focus to jump out, fly safely, and pilot my parachute. Nothing else exists once I put on that parachute. And that rush of adrenaline and dopamine is fantastic. I chase adrenaline and the feeling of falling to get that fight-or-flight rush. It helps boost my energy and I can ride the high of the chemicals for days."
