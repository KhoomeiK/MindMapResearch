I'm also super confused, I thought Doja Cat came out, and the fact that she let Nicki say that lyric on her song makes me just ????"
BipolarReddit,fnuhs13,t1_fnue22c,1587262405.0,"Aww thanks! We had senior projects for English class in my school and I'd originally intended to research bipolar disorder and heredity. It was really hard to find information so I did the manifestation of bipolar disorder instead, and my English teacher asked if I'd be interested in doing the presentation and talking about mental health on the Ted Talks day. It was pretty well received, I got a lot of compliments and I hope the people who listened to my talk walked away with more knowledge than when they entered."
BipolarReddit,fnu9fwi,t1_fnu9a9w,1587257285.0,"But also, I really don't tell people about my diagnosis. I think once I told someone I was close with, and they said ""You don't act like you have it though"" as a compliment I guess? I never brought it up again."
BipolarReddit,fnu9a9w,t3_g3nmy2,1587257193.0,"In my high school we had a special ted talks style day with like 30 of our graduating class of 500 students presenting. I was chosen, and I presented ""More than Just Moodswings: Bipolar Disorder"" and in it I talked about mental health and all the stigmas around bipolar disorder versus what it actually is, and I decided to put in a slide that said ""how to use the word bipolar in a sentence"" and I just wrote ""don't"". Explained it's not an adjective. I hope I educated everyone in the room that day on what bipolar disorder really is and isn't."

LawAndOrderSVU,fmd4tuc,t1_fmd48ua,1585959347.0,I agree that they're pretty good about casting diverse actors but my one gripe is that it seems like the only time they ever cast asian people they tend to fulfill stereotypes.
LawAndOrderSVU,fmd3vyr,t1_fmd3qrz,1585958756.0,what did you think of the episode? it kind of bothered me that they made the pastor black but i thoroughly enjoyed the episode. i was falling asleep in the dancer episode last week so this was refreshing.
LawAndOrderSVU,fmd29ni,t1_fmd15b9,1585957737.0,I guess I'm not well versed in the Law and Order SVU universe? I actually don't remember another episode with a pastor in it.

schizoaffective,fjhm849,t3_fdaurc,1583350828.0,"I had several hospitalizations over the course of a couple months and every time I left the hospital I'd be in another one within a week with another manic episode. In my final hospitalization the doctor wanted me to do ECT but the insurance refused to pay and recommended clozaril. I've been on it for five years and haven't had a manic episode since. It does cause extreme fatigue and weight gain though, which is really hard to adjust to. I can't function if I get less than 8 and a half hours of sleep."

I haven't disclosed anything about my diagnosis to the university and honestly the stigma around bipolar disorder makes me quite uncomfortable and I believe at my university if you need accommodations you have to disclose your diagnosis which I would rather not do. 

I could probably tell the professor I have a medical condition and I'm having a flare up, but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be doing that. Thanks for the idea though, I appreciate your input."

GayChristians,f3hncvz,t1_f3hhktd,1570926067.0,"Thank you for responding! 

I've come out to most of my close long term friends one on one. 

A couple weeks back I was at Bible study and something was said that bothered me but I didn't say anything. We're a small tight knit group of 8 or so people and we all love and care about each other a lot. One of them said he doesn't really talk to his roommate much and he's lonely. Then another person responded, ""When I was a freshman I had a bisexual roommate I didn't really talk to at all"". That really bothered me. 

I really haven't expressed anything that would indicate I'm not straight to anyone from my church or the Bible studies I go to, I tend to be careful with my words around them."

The pharmacy I go to really cares about me and they've told me I need a new doctor but I tried to find one and couldn't find anyone who would take my insurance. Hopefully caffeine will be able to reduce the side effects of the Latuda."

Little bit of nausea here and there but fortunately it hasn't been that bad, it's just annoying for example when I have my favorite food in front of me or something similar and I can only eat a few bites."
BipolarReddit,f2f1h3x,t1_f288tbp,1570208430.0,"I take it with food, I try really hard to eat 350+ calories every time I take it. I'm on trihexyphenidol  (artane) for side effects. Actually have never heard of gravol."
BipolarReddit,f2f1ci2,t1_f2e0wkv,1570208345.0,I always take it at night with dinner. Never taken it in the morning before.

BipolarReddit,ernvp5q,t1_ern6783,1561062148.0,I hope I don't get rage. I've been on it for about a week and I've actually never heard about the rage. Have you found a drug that works better for you?
BipolarReddit,ernvl8o,t1_ermrzyn,1561062077.0,Thank you! Might just go buy a lot of soylent now. And ask the gym bros I know what kind of protein shakes they drink and pick their brains about the calories.
BipolarReddit,ernvhsa,t1_ermartq,1561062013.0,Sorry to hear that. Hope you've found something that works!
BipolarReddit,ernv8b0,t1_erlzask,1561061845.0,"TMI warning, I'm not sure if this is the Latuda or because I've been eating a lot of watermelon and vegetables but I went from being constipated to going several times a day. I'm positive the clozapine causes constipation but recently I've had the opposite of constipation (going A LOT). I wonder if anyone else has this? I would take this over constipation any day though. 

I do feel better mentally though. Much less depressed."
BipolarReddit,erlov9e,t1_erlomh5,1560992965.0,"That sounds like a great idea, thank you! I think I'll look into protein shakes and the stuff gym bros drink too."
BipolarReddit,erlosf9,t1_erlmwen,1560992905.0,I heard it doesn't metabolize correctly if you don't eat and you only get one fourth of the effect so I've made sure to eat. Fortunately it hasn't made me intolerably nauseous yet. Thank you!

BipolarReddit,eqyym6v,t1_eqtt8jm,1560391360.0,"Thank you! Taking it with food slipped my mind but I took it around 1 AM right before falling asleep, it's 10 PM right now and I just took it and I'm eating dinner. I've heard it causes nausea and vomiting and I hope that won't happen."
BipolarReddit,eqtre7a,t1_eqs9xoa,1560317776.0,"I go to what I believe is the best pharmacy on earth (one time I didn't have the blood work required for my clozapine and I'd taken all of my emergency stock of clozapine and it's illegal to dispense clozapine without the blood work, the pharmacy people called people for an hour pulling strings and they got me my clozapine even though I recklessly didn't get the blood work done), and I'm starting to take latuda, first time was tonight, and they found a coupon for me so it was $15 for 30 40 mg tablets. I'm not sure where or how they found a coupon but you might be able to with an extensive google search?"
schizoaffective,epvgruq,t1_eptt2m6,1559533717.0,"If you ever want to purge your intestines I would recommend magnesium citrate, I was on depakote and clozapine for a while and the constipation was bad. I think magnesium phosphate is used before people have colon surgery. It tastes like seltzer and comes in a bottle. Stay home until the effects wear off. *Everything will come out*. 

&#x200B;

Stool softeners never worked for me but if you're desperate and haven't pooped in a long while I'd take magnesium citrate on Friday and stay home for the weekend."
