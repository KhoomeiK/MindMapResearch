aspergers,fr4qw52,t1_fr4pne4,1589895040.0,"No problem, although I do think my dislike of sharing my emotions colours my view on others sharing their emotions. Which I suppose isn't fair because many people do find it beneficial to share. 

I don't want to discourage you or anyone else really from exploring the possibility of communicating to others how you feel.

I'm only saying this because you ended your post with saying how you feel horrible not being able to express how you feel. I have no such feelings of guilt so that's okay for me, but if it bothers you then it might be worth looking into learning how to communicate better? Maybe start by sharing when only a little bit sad and not completely overwhelmed to the point where you can't communicate?"
aspergers,fr4p0dv,t3_gmn2fe,1589893860.0,"I go into shut down mode when feeling down as well. I don't know whether it's an inability to express myself or because I'm unwilling to express myself.

I personally don't believe in sharing emotions and all that talking about feelings and stuff so maybe that's part of it.
People have learned to just leave me alone when I'm non-communicative now so I at least get left alone when my thoughts are negative.

I guess you have to ask yourself whether you want to be able to communicate when you are sad or whether you want people to leave you alone to process your own thoughts?"
stopdrinking,fr0pr54,t3_glzzzo,1589803510.0,"Going through the same thing, the only thing that works for me is to delay having the drink. If you have alcohol in the house, get rid of it.

I've also always been I guess sort of depressed and suicidal too, but that's really just how I'm built - like it's not something therapy or whatever is going to fix. That would be like trying to change the colour of my eyes by talking about it.

I guess my point is that I didn't know that alcohol worked to suppress emotions. If that's the case then it makes sense why I drank so much and so frequently.

People talk about going back to the happy person they were before alcohol took that away but I was never a happy person. Like ever.

Within two months I was back at almost half a bottle of whisky per night.
