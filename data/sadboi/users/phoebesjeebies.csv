AnorexiaRecovery,flku8vz,t3_fpayvs,1585247784.0,"Hey honey, I'm so sorry to hear that. Anorexia is tough for a million reasons and actual GI complications make it tougher. My own experience was that I had some actual GI problems while my ED wasn't in an active cycle, but after they spiraled (largely due to complications from pain management medication and extreme stress etc) my ED did too. Hard. So basically other health issues set the severe GI issues in motion, which caused me to legitimately and unintentionally lose a ton of weight and go to the ER several times etc and then that kicked off a huge anorexia/bulimia spiral. When I started to recover, the GI stuff evolved as well and made it even more difficult than it would otherwise have been. But I was able to get back to a more reasonable weight and as long as I pay attention to what I eat (in the sense of following a mostly gluten-free and mostly lower-FODMAP method) it's not too bad now.

One thing that I didn't realize for a long time was just how much of my digestive issues on the ED upswing were due to ED itself. Reintroducing food in a significant way and the impact that can have on someone as malnourished and unwell as I was can do a number on your system. There were things I thought were related to my IBS-C/SIBO etc but after doing a very deep dive on the physical process of refeeding and what it feels like and what it can do to your body, I figured out that much of it was likely just an unfortunate part of the physical recovery process. I had to keep reminding myself that just because it feels bad does not mean that it is bad. Feeling super bloated, feeling like there's just a brick of food sitting in your stomach, having bathroom issues, getting shaky from not eating for hours when before I could've gone the whole day, finally hitting the refeeding ""bingeing"" frenzy, all sorts of incredibly uncomfortable stuff was mainly just part of the process. It got a lot better once my body adjusted to being fed and I restored a decent amount of weight.

So although I'm not sure how similar our situations are or where you are in your process, I can definitely relate. You're not alone. And with the help of a good gastroenterologist and ED specialist, I know you can get through this. Maybe it'll get better for you too.

Feel free to reach out privately if you want some links to some of the sites where I read about how it wasn't just me, physical recovery really can fuck you up (for a bit). Reading about others' experiences and seeing that it was a real thing truly helped me.

So although there's nothing inherently weird or inappropriate about how you want your life to be, this kind of dissatisfaction with how it is will continue to be a problem, either in other areas or with your music career or both. This level of depression is serious and you deserve to feel better and tale care of yourself. I know the last thing you want is to spend less time on your dream, but an hour a week will help you tremendously in both the long and short term, and make you better prepared and more well-balanced when you do make it to a production career.

That's what therapy is for. Becoming stronger in your own state of being and understanding yourself is crucial for a happier life, which includes healthy relationships (whether they're casual sex or a lifelong marriage). The foundation needs a bit of work, it seems, and you can chase the latest self-improvement trends or get shredded or any other thing that may help a bit.

The best thing you can do for your friend is try to get them to go to therapy. This is a situation for a professional whose job it is to facilitate these realizations. Support as best you can without enabling. And remember that the behavior and the person are not the same thing. Good people do crappy things, bad people do good things, sick people do all sorts of shit that isn't necessarily tied to who they really are.

Self-awareness is the first step, which you're already excelling at. Congrats! Next could be self-tolerance; you're still unhappy with yourself but it's kind of like having a shitty little sibling. You don't want to be around them or babysit but you have to, and you know it won't last forever. Next would be self-acceptance; you don't love yourself but you're no longer experiencing the constant negative self-talk, you can look in the mirror without getting upset, whatever it is that you dislike so much. You coexist with yourself and it's going ok. THEN self-love. Putting pressure on yourself to go from 0 to 100 can sometimes make this kind of stuff seem so much harder or impossible, but you might find it's easier if you break it down into more manageable and concrete goals.

Along the same lines of the ""Speak to yourself the way you would speak to your best friend"", you can also reframe it as ""Would I let anyone else talk to me like this?"". The answer should be no, and should include yourself.

Exercises like writing down a list of things you like about yourself may be helpful also. Even if there's only 1 to start with and you don't fully believe it.

Or think about what you enjoy about your friends and family. Do you have any of those same positive traits? Probably, because all those people care deeply for you. Try to look at yourself through your connections with others.

Give yourself credit! You're your own parent now, and if you did something good, it's your job to recognize that. There is no achievement too big or too small, all of them warrant your own internal gratitude. Even if it seems unworthy.

Remember that it starts somewhere. If you're trying any of the advice on here and it doesn't help the first time or you don't believe what you're telling yourself, do it anyway. People often stop because it feels false and weird to be speaking so hollowly, but that's basically saying ""I can't achieve self-love because I don't have self-love"", right? So continue doing this stuff even when it seems meaningless and untrue. That's just part of the process.

Ultimately, therapy and sharing will help the most. I'm so proud of you for taking those steps! Talking about this stuff with a trained professional to get to the root of it is crucial, and embracing your support network is super important too.

AnorexiaRecovery,fi8mve3,t1_fi7rs1b,1582243773.0,"Can confirm. Recovery ""bingeing"" isn't true bingeing - it's your body not trusting you and trying to regain some normalcy. Your hunger cues have been out of whack for a very long time and it takes a little while for them to normalize, just as it took awhile for them to go away. Your body has been literally starving for a prolonged period and is now desperate to take in what it needs to perform repairs, to regain function, to optimize performance, to not just barely survive but to be healthy. It feels wild and the perceived lack of control can be a mindfuck since anorexia is so much about control. But try your best to just buckle up and hang on. The ride will gradually slow down and come to a much more comfortable cruising speed once your body has done its thing. Give it what it wants, which I know is easier said than done. Trust the process though and when you don't, tell yourself out loud to trust it. Just keep saying it or come back here and re-read this. What you are going through is a normal and beneficial and healthy part of recovery. It will be ok, even when it doesn't feel like it.

If you're really concerned about the itchy scalp/hair situation, and are not already receiving medical treatment and counseling, you can always see a doctor. I strongly recommend doing so anyway if you're not - I'm no expert, I just have personal experience, secondhand experience, and research - but it does seem like it could be related as well. We tend to forget the hell that our bodies go through, and that the effects need to sort themselves out as we get better.

There may be other options, ways of finding additional assistance and solutions. People stepping up for you. But you can't work if you're not alive, dearest, and if you're unwell enough to require residential then that is a sure-fire sign that your ED needs to be the priority in the sense of addressing it, not masking or excusing it. I know the financial struggle is real. You're not making that up and it's a valid concern. But is there truly nothing else that can be done? You can't talk to your HR department?

You don't have to hate him, but I agree completely that you should break up with him. It might be painful and confusing but it really is the best thing to do. His behavior is very problematic and is almost guaranteed to get worse. You neither deserve nor need all of that, and it's neither your problem nor your responsibility.

ED is like a parasite that lives in your brain and will do WHATEVER IT TAKES to keep you feeding it (by not feeding/caring for you). Right now, how much you're hung up on whether the amount you're eating is acceptable or not seems like proof positive to me that it's recovery eating and it's a necessity. That phase takes different time for different people and even different recovery attempts. It doesn't matter if it wasn't this long before, because this time is not exactly the same as last time. I know how hard it is to sort things out and find the truth. I know it's confusing as hell right now. I know you are lost.

The more this bronco bucks, the more you can bet you're on the right track. These are the death throes of disease and if you can hang on, they will fall away. There is no cure, you know that, but it will NOT always be like this. You know that too. Now try to remind yourself of it as much as possible, especially when ED is screaming the opposite at you. Try not to focus on any backsliding - recovery is not a straight line. But the only way out is through. Hang on, and talk about it as much as you possibly can. Bringing darkness into the light helps rob it of some of its power, and if it's uncomfortable to discuss, that's usually a sign that you absolutely must. How you do it is flexible, and doesn't  need to look the same with every session or conversation with a friend. But you gotta do it. If you don't have an ED-specific therapist, I highly recommend seeing one and/or joining a support group. Acknowledging your triggers is great and pushing yourself too far isn't, but do your best to talk about it, that's all. Make your needs known as far as how talking about it impacts you.

All the great techniques in the world or changing your surroundings won't sustainably work if there are underlying issues that need to be addressed. I don't know that that's the case with you, but it may be worth considering. When it comes to therapy, you (usually) have nothing to lost but a copay and an hour a week. I have yet to meet someone whose life was made worse by trying it, y'know? 

Best of luck to you - I'm proud of the changes you have made and your ongoing efforts to keep getting where you want to be. It's amazing, and I believe in you."

Also, in my experience, as with any trauma, life before kind of doesn't matter. That's the depression that runs concurrent with it. What matters is life in recovery. The present is what needs your attention, so that your future becomes the way you need it to be. So that the circumstances that facilitated developing ED in the past, in your life before, are not the circumstances in your life once you're healthy.

Wishing you all the best honey. Recovery isn't a straight line. We all make our way clumsily and not all at once and it's ok. Whatever gets you there."

30ROCK,fb3vdco,t1_fb3ticp,1576491256.0,"There are some... blursed images of her out there.

Liz is basically a brutally honest reflection on/exaggeration of early 20s baby Tina, and iirc the reason there aren't more photos of her from a certain time period is that she (by her own admission) was overweight enough and self-conscious enough that she avoided photos. She may have also been sensitive about her scar. She learned a lot about how to take care of herself and make what she has work for her (I mean, I think she's gorgeous too but many of us ladies go through a process).

Ultimately I think it had a lot to do with how she seems to be like many women (myself included) - if left in her natural state, we wouldn't be having this conversation because the version of her career that exists today wouldn't. I'm not saying she'd be unattractive, I'm saying she would say she is, and Hollywood probably would too due to impossibly high standards. It took work to find her mass visual appeal, whereas some women are considered more attractive with less work.

But I also suspect that part of why it works on the show is that looking back, Tina may rightfully think she was too hard on herself at some points and alternately a little less in touch with what wasn't working for her during others.

Regardless, she's beautiful and that's nowhere near the top of the list of reasons she's amazing - not because she's only kind of pretty or anything, but because it's a damn long list."

I absolutely think that if you put the effort in and find someone who's a good fit, this will make a sustainable and huge positive impact and get you able to do everything you want to.

I'm not saying that moving is a bad idea, but I strongly suggest starting with the therapy. The siren call of a new state is understandably tempting, but why would life be so different in a new environment when the majority of what you have described are things that need to be internally addressed, y'know? I mean I moved across the country and I'm so much happier here, but I still ran into a whole world of shit because I hadn't adequately handled what was going on underneath. I learned the hard way that you can try to outrun your problems, but they are always faster than you. The only way to resolve a lot of this is to do the emotional work, which will then turn into the external work/change you are so admirably looking for.

That's not to say nothing external can change in the meantime, I just mean that if it was only a matter of willing yourself into a different mindset and better life that's more in line with how you want it and yourself to be... well, you'd be there already, right?

So I am extremely proud of you for wanting this change and being so open about it. Full stop. That's amazing and already so much further ahead than most people get, ime. Keep that fire of change burning. I'd just love for you to also feed those flames with the internal combustion that is the emotional growth and work that can almost exclusively be obtained through therapy, so that the fire doesn't burn out again in a year or two. You already know how hard it is to start it again.

I believe in you, and you ARE going to do it. Best of luck, and reach out if you want. We're all here for you."

relationships,faydd1e,t3_eardrg,1576398882.0,"Ultimately it depends on how you and your husband feel about it, and secondarily, other cues from this person. Even if you think you can gey past it but your husband cannot get past it, then that isn't unreasonable and you should let the sun set on this friendship. However if both of you think that from your end you can potentially come back from this, I'd take a good hard look at this guy, what his motivations were, and put him under a microscope as well as paying close attention to how this makes you feel now and in the future.

IF the friendship is worth all that to you.

Because not only was there the initial infraction, but now his poor judgment (giving him the benefit of the doubt) has put you in a position to do a ton of emotional labor. He just dropped this mess at your doorstep, and I'm not sure if it's ultimately a worse sign of things to come that he did it out of a desperate and gross misunderstanding of appropriateness or if he intentionally is trying to subvert your marriage or has been carnally lusting after you for awhile etc. No matter what, he/this is now taking up a large chunk of your attention, and the emotional drain and the price for keeping this person in your life just skyrocketed. Is he worth it?

Some of what the others are saying is only true to a point - he's a guy and although guys are 100% responsible for their behavior and being grown-ass adults who respect women as human beings, if you're at all his type, he has had... impure thoughts about you. It's a not entirely inaccurate generalization. That is NOT an excuse for what he did, I just mean that he would be no different from the majority of other guys in that sense that the decision shouldn't be made based off of ""has he thought about you sexually"" because of course he has. Him and every other dude. He's not a predator for being attracted to his friend's wife/his married friend, it's how he handles it that's the issue. Men will be attracted to you and that's fine, as long as they behave appropriately. The same is true for ladies and all others of course but this isn't a feminist studies summit on gender biases as they pertain to the cultural viewpoint of sexual attraction. We're not talking about that, we're talking about this.

As for his motivations, if he is dealing with a mental illness or neuro disorder etc, then the question becomes, ""yes he apologized but did he do that because we're upset or because he genuinely demonstrates an understanding of why this was not ok and if it's the latter, do I think he is capable of behaving appropriately moving forward""? And are you the person who can be comfortable with their decision, or if you stay friends will you ruminate on this and will it eat at you every time you see him? If you cut ties, will you constantly beat yourself up about it or be worried about not giving him a second chance? Either way it's fine, but you should think about the answer.

I really hope this helps, and I'm so sorry you both have been put in this position. All I can say besides the above is that if it was me, he was a really good friend otherwise, husband could be chill about it, and I truly believed it was a grossly misguided attempt to figure out a situation he had no better ideas on how to handle and seemed to be a one-time grossly miscalculated judgment call, I'd probably still be friends with the guy. But that's a whole lot of ifs. In my experience, that's a statistically unlikely number of ifs.

domesticviolence,falvjgh,t1_fak0zke,1576191188.0,"I'm so sorry for everything you're going through. It's genuinely awful, and as people have pointed out, all you did was take a very basic step to protect yourself. He got himself arrested, and you were well within reason to call the cops. If your best friend came to you with this situation, you'd want her to do exactly what you did (and probably more). Try to be as kind and as understanding and supportive to yourself as you would be to her.

The others are right - please reach out to your local DV services. They have resources, which should include shelter access, case management, legal support, rehoming help, and government aid programs. There are a surprising number of free programs and resources for victims of DV, and it can be a lot to slog through but that's where DV services come in and help. It makes a huge difference.

But ultimately, your safety is more important than your financial well-being. If you have to stay in a shelter temporarily, stop paying bills, even file for bankruptcy, it is worth it. YOU are worth it. Nothing is worth being subjected to inhumane conditions, and having rh most basic need of being safe in your own home ripped away from you, and likely to only get worse.

I'm very proud of you for going to the hospital, going to the police, and coming on here to share. You are clearly very strong and resilient, so I know you can do this. It's hard, but staying is even harder - it's just more familiar. Living like this is so unacceptable and extreme, but you may have forgotten how bad it really is because in a weird way you've gotten used to it. Try to remember, nobody should be treated this way. A stranger on the street gets treated better than you're being treated. There is something very wrong there, and potentially deadly. It only takes getting hit once to be knocked into something the right way or concussed hard enough etc. You get the idea.

I had no local family and not much money (and was out of work on disability due to major health problems) when I left. The situation was not identical, but the point is that I and many of the women in my DV support group had to leave even though the circumstances were far from ideal. There is never a good time to leave, so if you use that a reason to stay, you will end up spending the rest of your life with him. A life that will potentially be much shorter as a result.

It sucks so much that the onus is on the victim to do all this stuff and put the work in to change their whole life just to escape a piece of shit. But ultimately you will be so much better off, and even stronger and more capable and knowledgeable than you are now (which is really saying something). The others are also correct that there are laws in place which can either forcibly remove him from the home/lease or allow you to break your lease without consequences (that's what I did). This is a great example of how although there's a long way to go, victim assistance and considerations have increased significantly. 

As you figure out your plan, which should start with DV services (try thehotline.org or Jewish Family Services if you're unsure where to begin - also the cops should have a pamphlet with a list of places) please try to take care of yourself. Take deep breaths when you're stressed, feed yourself as much and as healthily as you can, take your vitamins, and cry when you need to.

You're going to get through this. You can do it. We all believe in you and we're rooting for you. Your pain is real and your actions are justified, and we're here to help with both. Big hugs from an internet stranger."
domesticviolence,failcnl,t3_e9azrx,1576110642.0,"I'm so sorry for everything that you're going through. There is literally no circumstance under which the rape or assault of a significant other is acceptable. You wouldn't be ok with your best friend or even a stranger being treated the way he treats you, so that bare minimum standard should at least apply to his partner too. There is no way on this earth that you cause this behavior. There is no excuse for it, I promise you. No matter what you feel you have done, it is NOT bad enough to warrant this. Trust me.

As far as leaving is concerned, everyone else is correct - it is imperative that you get out. It's a matter of time before he permanently injures or kills you. You've already seen that he's escalating, and it will not stop. The ""human"" moments are a manipulation. He does that specifically because he knows you are susceptible to it. If it didn't work, he wouldn't do it. He is not a viable human, and will not get better, he will only get worse. And while it can be hard to care about what happens to yourself when you're so lost and traumatized, coming on here and posting and thinking about leaving shows me that you are smart, strong, resilient, and on some level you know this is flat-out wrong and that the ONLY way it will stop is if you leave.

Leaving is like going to rehab - there's never a good time to do it and it feels like blowing your life up, but feelings aren't facts and you are actually saving your own life by getting out ASAP. Obviously he is extremely dangerous, so it would be good to formulate a plan to leave if possible but ultimately you need to get out right away. If you're not sure where to start, you can go to thehotline.org and also see if there's a Jewish Family Services branch in your area. Even if there's not, I'm sure there are DV services and shelters etc in your area. As soon as you're able, getting into trauma-centered therapy would also be absolutely necessary. I also agree that you should go to the police, but given the circumstances I would think that leaving first and getting to a safe place before you get into the legal stuff and obtain a TRO etc would be a good idea.

But regardless of what else you do, leaving is the #1 priority. This is literally a life and death emergency. It's easy to lose track of how extreme this is because it's so commonplace and is a part of your everyday life, which normalizes it to some extent. But it really is that dire, and your life is worth saving. Nobody should have to live like this, and that includes you.

Don't wait until school is over. Yes, you might have a harder time finishing or you risk not graduating etc
 But if he maims or kills you or keeps you from leaving the house etc, you definitely won't, and that'll be the least of your troubles. Your safety is more important than money, school, work, friends, family, and certainly more important than him. It is THE priority. I'm not sure why you would lose all your friends upon leaving him, but if someone stops being friends with you because they'd rather be friends with your monster/abuser or because they don't want to deal with your situation and needs, they're genuinely shitty people and you're better off without them.

Keep in mind that you're looking at the future through the lens of the present. When you get out and get professional help, you might find that it's much easier to make friends. You might make a number of close, wonderful friends through a DV support group. You may meet people on Reddit who care about you and are willing to be actual friends too. But the point is that you will not be the same after you leave, because although trauma doesn't resolve the second it stops, you will not be living in a daily hell and can become your own person, with all the wisdom and experience and healing that this whole process will bring. It'll take awhile but you can learn to be happy, which attracts even more people to you. And in my experience, the people who are selected by these predators as their victims are usually chosen because they are wonderful humans - empathetic, kind, creative, considerate, understanding, accepting, and deeply loving. The very qualities that make us awesome people are the reason they prey on us, digging their claws into us and taking advantage of all those wonderful qualities. The same qualities that will ensure you're able to make friends, build a support network, and have a great life.

Keep coming back here. Plenty of us have extensive experience with the process of leaving, with getting restraining orders, with going through divorce, dealing with insurance, using government programs, and all sorts of helpful stuff. Obviously going through a DV program which has resources and case management etc is the best way to go, but we are here to support you and help as best we can the whole way. You are a beautiful courageous person, and we see your pain and we believe in you. You can do this.

domesticviolence,f9wkorp,t1_f9wjfr4,1575694195.0,"Real quick, I should clarify - you won't just become a fully realized person, you'll become more than that. One of the few things that offsets the horrible shit that abuse victims have been through is that if you survive and do the work on the other side, you understand people, the world, and yourself on a very deep level that your average person usually doesn't (or it takes them til they're 90). This can enrich your life and experience so much, and keep you from falling into a lot of the situations and ruts that others often do. Think about it this way - it's like we condensed all kinds of terrible experiences into a decade and got it out of the way super early. As you are further and further removed from it and do more and more of the work (therapy, DV support, talking to others, rebuilding, gaining new skills etc) it's like you unlock all sorts of insight and answers and information that someone who hasn't been through this kind of thing is unlikely to get to, or pieces together bit by bit over the course of their lifetime, whereas you're doing it basically in one fell swoop really early. You'll be much better able to enjoy your new life down the road because of it, and be an even better mother and partner and friend for it, too. Though I'm sure you're probably pretty great at that stuff already.  :)  The point is, it doesn't just get better, it'll get amazing. Just keep doing it, and you'll get there. I promise."
domesticviolence,f9wjfr4,t3_e79bgg,1575693608.0,"I'm so, so sorry for everything you've been through.

You're not ""playing the victim"" - you *are* a victim. Struggling to get through all of this and rebuild and reaching out for support is not playing the victim, it's brave and admirable. Laying down and giving up or going back to him would be understandable but the opposite of that. You are so, so strong and I *know* you are going to get through this.

It is completely normal to miss him, to still love him, to have a whole lot of mixed feelings about everything that's happened - including the (100% necessary) steps you have taken to protect yourself. Without you even having to say it, I know part of why you feel remorseful about it is that he probably manipulated you into believing, at least on some level, that you're wrong for doing these things or that you are the problem, not him. Your actions confirm that logically, you know better. It may take time for you to know it all the way, and even more time for you to know it in your heart, but I promise you that you did the right thing and must continue to do so. Escaping this man and removing him from you and your kids' lives (as much as possible) is the best thing that you've ever done, the tricky part is that right now it feels like the worst. Feelings don't last though, and this one too shall pass.

A lot of us go through this. Not all codependent relationships are abusive and not all abuse requires codependency, but for us lucky ladies who were picked at a very young age, often coming from traumatic backgrounds and selected specifically because we're young and vulnerable, codependency goes hand in hand with the abuse and who can focus on becoming a fully realized person when you're married and having kids and working and constantly dealing with the monster of abuse? It's impossible. The good news is, through this process, you will become a fully realized person. You will learn the things you don't know, you will find new friends and re-establish old ones, you will reach out to strangers on the internet, you will continue going to therapy and dealing with your feelings, you will meet other people who have gone through similar things, you will get used to being on your own, and you will come to love the freedom it affords even when it's hard.

I met my abuser at 18 and we got together, then eloped when I was 20. He was 27 and so smart and knowledgeable and knew all sorts of things and had all these skills that I didn't. I finally left last year, after 11.5yrs of codependency and emotional, financial, and occasionally physical abuse. I was out of work on disability leave at the time, and since then I've been financially ruined (like, can't afford groceries or gas fairly frequently and am \~$90k in debt partly because of him), had even more health problems, have been living by myself, only recently been well enough to start working again (part-time; doesn't even almost cover my basics) and still have no idea how to file my taxes or cook. It's hard. It's really, really hard. But I'm doing it, and so many amazing things have come from this process, horrendous as it's been. I've met incredible people through the weekly DV support group I go to (highly recommend, btw), I've reconnected with countless friends whose friendship I neglected because I was either too busy, too unwell, or too stressed to engage with people, I've found out that I'm capable of way more than I ever imagined, I've learned a lot about myself, and I've learned soooo much about relationships and abuse and what it means/takes to live a healthy life. I'm not living it yet, but I'm making big steps towards that, especially as it pertains to relationships. I still loved my ex when I left, and now I couldn't be less in love with him, and cannot fathom ever loving someone like him ever again. I now know exactly why the relationship was a terrible idea from the start, why even the ""good times"" weren't as they seemed, and why all of it happened. I'm even helping two of my closest friends get out of their toxic/abusive relationships. I can go where I want (when I can afford gas, lol), I don't get screamed at for doing menial tasks the ""wrong way"", I don't have to walk on eggshells in my own home, I don't worry about the neighbors hating me/calling the cops over the noise, I can have whatever color bedspread I damn well please, I don't have a constant chirping of negativity in my ear, I never wonder if it's safe to go home - I also could go on.

But the point is that you're here. You're doing it. That's already amazing, and is proof positive that you have what it takes to keep doing it. Yes, it's incredibly difficult, but anytime you question yourself, you can look back and see that what you have already done is evidence that you can handle whatever is in front of you, because you handled the shit out of what's behind. I don't even know you, but I believe in you so hard. You've got this, and some day your kids are going to be so proud of their mom for the wonderful gift she gave them and herself, and the incredible strength and growth it took.

In the meantime, we're here for you. Big hugs."
domesticviolence,f9uszr8,t3_e70uf9,1575657162.0,"This 100% a manipulation tactic and is flat-out abusive. It's a different face of the same beast that is abuse. It is not anything other than him trying a technique out on you and seeing how well it works. If it didn't effect you, he would stop and try a different one. I am absolutely certain of this.

Please seek out a local DV group program, if at all possible, as well as individual therapy for yourself. This is a really toxic and dangerous situation, and although you are obviously smart and capable, it's extremely concerning - and I'm some stranger on the internet; if I don't even know either of you and this is so troubling, that should really say something.

If you're not sure where to start, thehotline.org is a good beginning, or you can see if there's a place like Jewish Family Services near you (do not need to be Jewish).

We're here, we see you, we know your pain, and we believe in you. Big internet hugs."

AskReddit,f9ul6yx,t3_e6oh3e,1575653034.0,"Considering I just got a $238 speeding ticket (it's even more expensive to do traffic school) and I regularly can't afford groceries or gas, that sounds pretty great."
GriefSupport,f9snu4v,t1_f9sgilg,1575596274.0,"Nobody else can tell you how much pain you're in - you are feeling what you're feeling, and that's that.

However, do you think you're making people feel awkward because of evidence like behavioral responses or someone telling you that, or is it just a worry that you are projecting onto people?

I'm so happy to hear that you're getting help. It's hands-down the best thing you could possibly do for yourself. If you haven't already, it could be good to explore this with your therapist and review how you currently try to talk to people about your grief, and then depending on how that shakes out, go over different techniques of expressing yourself. Sometimes it's just a matter of tweaking the way you say something, not no longer saying anything, y'know? 

Obviously I can't say for sure what the situation is but based on my experience and what you wrote, I do wonder if that might be the case here. I often project my social anxieties onto others instead of letting people think/feel whatever they think/feel and allowing them to inform me, rather than me trying to dictate how they feel in the echo chamber of my own hear based on little to no objective/observable evidence."
GriefSupport,f9sn8qj,t1_f9smk4h,1575595864.0,"If your loved ones never ask how you're doing, you can talk to them about that, and also volunteer how you're feeling. If they continue to be aloof or emotionally neglectful, it might be time to find some new people from which to form your tribe, and/or strengthen your preexisting relationships with those who have been secondary players in your support network. It's worth trying to lead the horse to water, but if it still won't drink, you're gonna need a different horse.

I'm sorry that you seem to feel emotionally abandoned. It's a terrible feeling, but the good news is, strangers on the internet care and want to listen, so you can definitely find IRL folks who do too."
domesticviolence,f9rz63g,t1_f9rtwgh,1575583353.0,"You could rinse and repeat this for the rest of your life, which may be much shorter if he continues to escalate. Is it worth it? Is this really how you want to spend the rest of your days? If your best friend described this cycle of abuse to you, would you want her to stay and keep bending over backwards for a man who is manipulating her into hoping he'll get better when he won't? It doesn't have to be like this, but the ONLY way it will stop is if you leave. I'm sorry, but that's true. The more time you spend researching domestic abuse, going to DV support groups, talking to DV counselors, reading others' posts on reddit etc, the more you will see that everyone says the same thing because these abusers follow very similar patterns. They all do the same kinds of stuff, follow similar cycles, use identical tactics, to the point that it becomes predictable once you learn enough about it. It's wild. I'm not telling you this stuff so definitively because I think I'm smart, it's because over and over and over I have been shown and told exactly how this goes. And you are coming to realize that also. It's a hard truth but ultimately it will set you free."
domesticviolence,f9ry77f,t3_e6nq5s,1575582962.0,"We went to couples therapy after he was arrested. It soon came out that he went because 1) he blamed me for everything and wanted to use couples counseling to get me in line, 2) he fully expected to convince the therapist that he was right and to be validated, and 3) he read online that it would look bad in court if he didn't attend counseling of some kind.

It was awful and I wish I had just left when he was arrested.

Here's the thing - abusers almost never get better, and I'm sorry but your SO is extremely unlikely to be the super rare exception. Abusers also will not get better they are unwilling to do the highly intensive personal work on themselves required to do so, if it's even possible in the first place. Attending couples therapy is not how that gets done and is likely to do more harm than good.

I also didn't really see that much of an issue with couples therapy, but I am now very aware of why everyone says not to do it with an abuser. The therapist took the situation seriously but not seriously enough. My ex was able to gaslight the therapist enough that he questioned which of us was telling the truth, despite a lot of evidence and basic logic confirming that it was me. 

My ex also reacted badly to many of our sessions, to the point where he could no longer hide how fucked up he was and had 2 psychotic episodes in the span of 1 morning, before and after our session. It was the day I knew I had to leave. Even before that, he would blow up in the room and use that as fuel for fighting at me once we were home, where it got so much worse.

Honey, you need to leave. I'm sorry, nobody wants to hear it, but it's true. This is not a salvageable relationship and the fact that you continue to accept his treatment is proof that you need to be out of this so that you can address whatever is going on with you as well as leaving because he is dangerous and abusive and not at all an appropriate partner.

Look at how far off the rails things have gotten. You can't even go to a therapy session without problems. Everyone is telling you the same thing because it's true. You would treat a stranger on the street better than he's treating his partner. That's not OK and it's not changing.

I know leaving is hard. But staying is even harder, it's just more familiar. You can do this. I know you can. Asking us this question is evidence already that you are smart and capable and strong and deep down, you already know what needs to happen.

We're here for you, fwiw, and we see your pain and we believe in you."
GriefSupport,f9rvo00,t1_f9rig1c,1575581942.0,"I think the key phrase there is ""too often"". There is a lot of room between ""all the time"" and ""never"". If your loved ones don't want to hear about your feelings, maybe they shouldn't be loved ones. But understanding that it can be difficult or awkward for those who care about you to be overexposed to your feelings is also important."
domesticviolence,f9rv11o,t3_e6lc90,1575581684.0,"It's funny how taking the absolute most basic steps to protect yourself magically turns you into a selfish shitbag.

Stay strong and remember your truth. You are not wrong. You are not selfish. You are not asking too much by expecting to be treated at least as well as a stranger on the street would be.

Go to the cops, and we'll be here waiting to internet-hug you when you get back."
