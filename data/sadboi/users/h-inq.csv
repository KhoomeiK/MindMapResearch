xxfitness,fqe6s6w,t3_ghu1nd,1589302673.0,"As a 22 year old, I grew up in a town that basically had the mantra ""you're a stick or you're OUT"". When I went to college, I didn't really mind this because I was running track and playing soccer so I felt great about how I looked... I guess I fit the mold.

It's been so disgusting to come back here as a graduated student and still see that everyone eyes one another, makes comments on ""who really ballooned"" in college, and judges everything entirely on the physical. This made me think again for a second, and 1) realize how toxic my hometown is and 2) how much I support this.

I played rugby in college and it gave me defined muscle like never before. I was a tank, and I was heavier than I ever was (thank you, boat races). I also was the happiest and could run a sub 6 minute mile. Go figure. Love this."

relationship_advice,foud3yw,t3_g9mirq,1588081727.0,"I have felt this way (21F). This used to happen to me a lot when my mental health was really poor, and I wasn't feeling validated by myself, heard by my partner, or felt that there were a lot of problems.

I would like to hear more info, but I often have lost feelings when there have been serious issues. One of my prior relationships, with a girl a year senior, would often make sexual advances at terrible times, make me feel terribly for wanting to have alone time, and then trying to lure me back with nice statements. I was gaslit, and didn't even realize because all I could focus on was disassociating my feelings.

Try and address your feelings about this person, writing out the good and bad here. Sometimes, things just aren't what you thought-- and that's fine, but you will want to ensure that you understand your interest in this person."
relationship_advice,foucqiw,t3_g96tub,1588081505.0,"Such a fine line here, I respect you reaching out here. As a female who's definitely closer to your girlfriend's preliminary weight, and who has weighed +/- 10 pounds from my current point, weight fluctuates with the times.

I would try and connect with her prior to making pizza judgements. I think that sexual attraction is important and if you're not attracted, you're not. It's something valid to work on, but you need to *tread lightly*. Ask her to go on walks, watch a movie and make up rules about movement (e.g. every time there's an action scene, do a plank) and make it fun.

Movement can be so joyful and something to connect you two. It could also lead to \~spice\~ if you play it right. My best relationships have included runs together, going rock climbing, whatever intersects your interests!

Then, if this doesn't work, I would definitely try and assess what your goals together are. If you both want this to work out better, then it will. If this is really a breaking point for you two, maybe it wasn't meant to be. Just be careful and really think about how you want this message to move across."

Your trust in him doesn't seem high, and I would acknowledge how he always seems to jump when you look at his photo library and how you feel untrusting. Trust your gut here, but I would recommend 1) talking to him (even writing down points so you don't miss anything in the heat of the moment and can sit on it) and 2) calling it off.

Imagine spending your life with someone that you never trust. That won't help you, and you'll never have a positive relationship. Address it now and leave the relationship if that's what a conversation warrants. Your heart and health are more important!"

xxfitness,fnx2sui,t3_g2cyql,1587330356.0,"First of all- proud! I come from a place of anorexia myself, and it's incredibly difficult to move towards joyful movement and reacquaint yourself with it. I've been an athlete for 16/21 years of my life, and have pretty much tried every type of exercise so I think I have some to add.

Protein is entirely valid, but don't feel the need to overload your protein amounts. I think a lot of fitness people try and convince you that this is important, but it's more about the way that you move your body.

I've ran a lot, lifted a lot, done both at the same time, and tried HIIT/crossfit/yoga/biking-esque activities. To be honest, my rugby training in college was the most transformative to my muscles. We typically were utilizing weights, focusing on individual muscle groups throughout the week (whether it be lower body, upper, or either ""push"" or ""pull"" workouts). If you'd like to be toned, I'd highly recommend researching what weights pair with what exercises online, and developing a circuit for yourself!

The best thing is to limit your cardio a bit more (love walks tho, keep those), and to focus and move with *Intention* throughout your weight training. If you choose to do a tabata workout (popsugar has good ones on youtube) or even if you decide to alternate between weights, tricep dips, and some type of squat jumps, ensure that you feel your muscles activating. I lifted weights incorrectly for years and it did nothing for my body or the endorphines I felt from working out.

Feel free to PM me, happy to assist."

running,fnvn4sw,t3_g3wjue,1587299173.0,"Honestly, the whole Covid situation has changed things up, just like everyone else had said. I find the morning hours better to complete my work, as it's more flexible here (I'm a student, for context).

I've been timing my runs to be later in the day, when I've had some food and productivity under my belt circa 1-2PM.

As an athlete at school, I am used to waking up at 5:30, chugging coffee, and driving to campus to make a 6am workout. The most motivating things to me are making a hype alarm sound, forcing myself to go to bed earlier than expected, and either sleeping in my running clothes or leaving it right next to my bed. When you're dressed it makes it faster to chug coffee and bounce.

That being said, don't rush yourself at these times-- global pandemic is a bit different. I know that you live in the desert, but if you're feeling a run at a different time don't be afraid to move your routine to a later time (night runs may be rejuvenating? make the day seem better even when each day kinda sucks?). Good luck!"

mentalhealth,fnkpzph,t3_g2aumy,1587036375.0,"I typically feel detachment when I'm avoiding feeling-- it's just my own coping mechanism. I find that when I isolate even more, I live inside my own head and this is where the demons come to play.

I am the same. exact. way. I've challenged myself to talk to people I typically wouldn't-- whether it be my students (I'm a TA as a senior in college), or various others. At this time, I feel like I'm not capable of those big lofty conversations with loved ones, so I've shifted my attention to acquaintances and those that won't burn me out. 

In the most loving and caring way, I think it's best that you challenge yourself to talk, even if it's out of your comfort zone. These quarantine times are when we all feel a bit (read: **a lot**) chaotic in the brain and it's best to touch base with another. This community is here to support you, and I'll always be around if you ever need to chat.

Moral of the story, fight your brain's inclination to isolate. You're worthy of feeling good, even if your brain is like ""yep. nope. no contact today."" Perhaps try to write an email/long message to your SO (I did LDR for a long time) with your concerns. It's a great vessel for conversation that goes unused often. You can also allow yourself to feel through the words and not be embarrassed/vulnerable in the way you may feel via chat or face-to-face (screen-to-screen ??) contact.

Best of luck!"
mentalhealth,fnkpm43,t3_g29dod,1587036013.0,"As someone who's been an avid gym-goer and high school/college athlete:

I feel you. For a long time, I've struggled with my worth if I'm not being productive, if I'm not getting a good sweat on at the gym, seeing advancement, all that good stuff.

I'm trying to use this time to mend my view of exercise. I always try to think about ""treating myself like my best friend."" Would you push your friend to work out at 3 am, doing crunches or jumping jacks out of stress?

I've been going for countless walks, jump roping, and doing youtube Tabata/pilates/HIIT. I try a new video every day and see what feels good. My runs were phenomenal prior to this event and now (mainly because the weather is frigid and windy where I am) I'm not as incentivized to run. 

Be kind to yourself; you *are* a person-- a resource wouldn't come to this thread to talk about their concerns and questioning their worth. Take it easy, and move when it feels right. I'm in this boat with you, and things change. Some weeks you'll feel productive, other days not. Bodies are incredibly resilient and a month or two will not erase anything that you've done."
books,fnhsy8y,t3_g1uti0,1586968301.0,"This is one of the first sci-fi books that I read, and frankly *loved* (see what I did there). Yet, recalling the two or three times that I read this, it entirely makes sense.

I don't know if you've seen all of the Star Wars films, but I'm going to make a safe bet and say that yes. I always think about Dune like episodes I-III. The characters can seem slightly monolithic and rigid, but there's some type of sentimentality/heart for them that derives from the earlier movies. Even the tone in those movies differs greatly: episodes I-III are more pragmatic in tone while episodes IV-VI seem like true and multi-dimensional characters.

I think the true take-away from Dune is not only the world that was created but also the socio-political implications of the model. If you look at Paul and the others from the standpoint of the world in which they live, they're pretty dynamic given the setting. It definitely takes time to get used to and challenging your brain to think in that way. Then again, maybe because my dad pushed the books on me as a kid, I'm overly biased in this regard and re-wired my brain to be team Dune."

It's a competition of who can treat themselves more horribly but still come out on the other side. As someone who is innately so competitive, I think I definitely fell victim to this mindset but it certainly is intensified when you surround people with this mentality. I felt it as an athlete and it's a mindset I constantly have to challenge.

Something I still struggle with is finding the line of productivity and pushing myself way past healthy limits. I wonder about finding this line every day and removing burnout as some type of victory in my brain."
