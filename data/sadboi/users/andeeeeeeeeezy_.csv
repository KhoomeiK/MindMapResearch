They always get some shitty cover band to play the standard drunk white people songs like pour some sugar on me and living on a prayer, but BUT one year they had this cool group of dudes with keytars and they JAMMED, right? I don't even know what song they were playing but they had such a hyped crowd. Next thing you know, OBOE SOLO. This guy just whipped out an oboe and shredded out this wicked solo and no one knew what to do. 
From that day on I wanted to be him. I want to be the oboe guy."

Healthyhooha,faclpwg,t3_e8ji31,1575942002.0,"Hi love! Yeast infections are incredibly normal. But you definitely want to find out the trigger so you can prevent it in the future. I'm personally SUPER allergic to anything like bath/shower oils, latex condoms, and chlorine (internally from swimming), and those are things that always give me yeast infections. Anything not meant to go in there can cause one. Pregnancy also sometimes causes them! My advice: Monistat 7 day works the charm. I don't even know why they sell 1 or 3 day ones because the antibiotics don't last long enough to get rid of the infection. If it doesn't burn like all hell when you use it, I'd highly suggest taking a pregnancy test. When I was pregnant and had the symptoms, it didn't go away due to it being a chemical imbalance rather than actual infection. If it burns, it's an infection. 
I'd also suggest getting tested for STDs/STIs. 

Hope that helps!"
