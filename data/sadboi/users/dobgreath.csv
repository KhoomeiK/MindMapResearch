publichealth,fqisus9,t3_giyirq,1589400421.0,"I agree that it's a tactic to buy time and reduce the burden on our health system, e.g. ""flatten the curve,"" which I really think should be ""flatten the spike."" It helps to slow the pandemic while health workers figure out how to stop it, and while communities work out processes for social distancing, convince people to wear masks and wash their hands, and re-educate everyone on how disease spreads and how to minimize their risks.

Endgame-wise, I believe we'll see states and countries lifting the orders as soon as they can, and possibly reissuing similar or modified orders as new waves hit, until the virus has run its course globally."

transfashionadvice,firbrhg,t3_f997n0,1582661335.0,"I would say find just a few wardrobe staples and accessories that you really love. A favorite cardigan or duster can add flow/femininity to an outfit. If you're a scarf person, those can be a nice and versatile addition. And small things that accent your current favorites - camis, tights, slips for dresses and such. 

If your ears are pierced, consider longer earrings or drop earrings that elongate your neck and make you feel good. A favorite bracelet or necklace can make a big difference too. 

Lastly, maybe consider a petticoat for your favourite skirts. It just adds volume and bounce to your skirts. 

I bet you look wonderful. I hope you feel it, too."
transfashionadvice,fi4mmnd,t1_fi3jlu0,1582144241.0,"I agree with the docs and jeans. To buy pants: go to goodwill or another thrift store. There should be at least 10 or 20 pairs in your size. Try all of them. Take all the time in the dressing room. Have NO shame about taking your time-- these are your things, for you, and those other people in the store don't matter.  They may as well not even exist.  I often wear earbuds and listen to loud music when I'm in public, especially in stores, because it helps with my anxiety.  
And when you're trying things on,  only get the thing that makes you go ""YES!,""  nothing that just makes you just go ""okay."" Because if you buy things based on what other people will think, you won't feel more confident. Fuck other people. Get whatever makes you go ""YES."" If nothing, go back next weekend. Then next weekend. There's ALWAYS new things. 
Get a thing that makes you happy. And whenever you wear that thing, you will feel happy. It takes time to collect things for all parts of your body that make you happy. Also thredup is an online thrift store, but I urge you more than anything to try things on in person."

Also, if there's any way you could save money to go to a professional hairstylist (not a crazy expensive one) it will make a big difference. They'll listen better and spend more time trying to make sure they understand what you want. This may be something you have to sneak out and do without any parents/ guardians.

Also a different kind of love can be found outside the club: nerd love. Maybe see if you can squeeze in a local dungeons and dragons event before the planned od? Or any event at a comic book store. Nerds are really nice, and they make me feel loved. 

Also, metal shows are very inclusive and welcoming. I'm not much of a metal person but I've met some of the nicest people of my life at metal shows. And people of lots of ages go to them. 

The last place I could think of to find love is a nerdy school club. Like band, which was how I survived much of school.

Not having dated anyone is nothing to be ashamed of. I didn't go on a date until my sophomore year of college. That was years ago. I'm 25 now and have just fallen in real love for the first time ever, with a guy that's fucked up like me but in a different way. He doesn't judge when I get really low and do self-harm. He accepts that I'm not perfect. He doesn't try to ""mom"" me. It's not a perfect relationship but none is. I am shocked at how good love feels. But yeah dawg it took me till 25 to find it. 

The places that welcome outcasts can be tough to find, but I hope you can find love."
