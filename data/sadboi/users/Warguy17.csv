Imperator,fcyyor0,t3_ejl256,1578090011.0,Sponsor games with leader when you are in a republic. This raises his popularity up so that you can declare war on other nations without a tyrrany hit. Also for republic the thumbs up or down can be clicked on to see why each faction wont support an action. Moving slaves to one territory in a province is the best way to maximize the amount of money. Make cities where ports are and if there is more than one the ones with farmland give more pop capacity than others. Farmland is so important for slaves. Each territory has a resource and a certain amount of slaves gives another of that resource. Building a mine or a farm there will lower the requirements of slaves needed. Tactics is a huge way to win your battles. Top right of the army ui is a picture of a tactic. Recommend having a horse army with a really good general on it be your reinforcements. Whenever a battle happens the highest military general takes over and uses his tactics. When your bigger army goes in for a battle check what the enemy is using and go in with your higher general horse army and with the tactic that can beat that army.

StarWarsBattlefront,fcvb3xf,t3_ej336w,1577998395.0,Or have it arena style. Only one of your team can go into the arena and the other has to sit outside and watch. Geonosis would be good the arena from episode 2
Imperator,fcpe06z,t1_fcpdnfq,1577859955.0,Yes and you can spam sponsor games unlimited it only costs 5 money of his for a .50 a month popularity. And if you run with theology there's a rules popularity gain of .33 so he can have a passive .83 a month and if you extend elections to 5 more years you can do whatever you want
StarWarsBattlefront,fcou030,t3_ei9wa5,1577841517.0,This isnt something new or special. They need to up the battle points on all the heroes so there is less of this.

StarWarsBattlefront,fcotlj0,t1_fcopj1s,1577841201.0,I agree with you here. Honestly it wouldn't make sense for them to actually have the backstory of Slave 1 be any different it's such an iconic ship I probably wouldn't accept anything other than this explanation behind it.
Imperator,fcotc38,t1_fcopedp,1577840993.0,Well I'm not the guy to talk to about that. Just because I focus more on that than actually raising my ae and keeping it there. The most ae I'll accept is 30 probably and when I do that I dont go to war for a minute. It's just how I enjoy the game. But if you want to actually go wide then there might be a ton of problems. Try Carthage out.

worldnews,fco5q74,t1_fcnziio,1577824589.0,They were instrumental in this war. If germany didnt turn on the Soviets like they did we wouldn't be seeing the world like it is today. But even before the war started and the treaty with germany Soviets were asking for help from the west. But no one listened. France was on the brink of civil war anyways and Britian was too detached to care. Also U.S was completely out of it. What's fascinating to me is that people dont see the Soviets as winning almost single handedly the second world war. They held 1 front the bulk of the German army the very best and fought them all the way back. While the west unified attacked the weaker other side.
StarWarsBattlefront,fcnwzl5,t3_ei4wae,1577820110.0,It would be amazing and then you can actually go in the ship and blow it up as a second option but it's extremely hard to do. Also the team can go into turrets on the capital ship

SuicideWatch,f9i09vk,t3_e55w3s,1575325276.0,"Follow these thoughts realize that they are conditioning the way you behave in the world and how you see it. The universe is neutral we are just projecting what we think onto it. Yours came from a history of suffering and now here they are about to bear fruit. What we think about all of this isnt 100% true we act as if we understand it all. But why does a sunset look so beautiful? Or why do we feel emotion at all? Why can't we stop these thoughts going on and on? No one knows exactly why. But we can see that we dont know. And by not knowing we can see how whatever we do and think isnt in our control but we are able to rise above it and change it. Change these negative thoughts for good ones. Here is what I see from my perspective. People dont care for one another because that's how it's been for thousands of years. We passed this along. The most important question is if I'm suffering what can I do about it? Because the world cant save you, you have to save yourself. We can come in here and give you money and talk or whatever but it all is on you if you change your perspective."

StarWars,f8r7z3c,t3_e1pfu2,1574734128.0,"Yes here's why. They havent touched base with Finns struggle as a former stormtrooper and his complex way of looking at the world it's almost like he never was a trooper. Rey has almost no backstory if any and its clouded in mystery I cant relate to her at all. She seems like she was a bit over powered in the beginning but who knows they may explain why. Kylo has a very deep and conflicting character but the issue is whenever you have a glimpse of him either being badass he then contradicts himself by not killing his mom. Then whenever he gets mad he just gets in a baby tantrum which doesnt bode well with the audience. 

With the mandalorian however you can feel his struggle trying to provide for his clan. He isnt perfect far from it but he is still a badass. He talks less but his emotions are shown through actions. As for baby Yoda I think they might be focusing too much on him recently since his appearance but that's justified because of how fascinating he is. He just makes adorable faces over to mando and then that's that. For some reason however that works to pull on peoples heart strings. I'm loving the series and excited for a possible reveal that that is Yoda cloned."
