GenderCritical,fpbkavj,t1_fpbaf4v,1588471973.0,I doubt these men have picture ID as women. It is insanity to allow just anyone to self-identify into women's spaces. We have to put our foot down.
GenderCritical,fpbk4l0,t3_gcgd2t,1588471859.0,Please file a complaint. This is not ok. If they are women there should be some sort of proof of that like a picture ID.

UnresolvedMysteries,fpb2zcv,t1_fpahkck,1588461025.0,"This is a Will Farrell comedy where he plays a guy from Húsavík a small town up North who enters and wins the local competition and goes to represent Iceland in the main Eurovision song contest. Looking it up I see Rachel McAddams plays in it too 

I really hope they decide to digital release it on the paid services https://www.icelandreview.com/news/will-ferrell-and-rachel-mcadams-to-play-icelanders-in-upcoming-eurovision-film/

To me it just creates nuances to the spectrum of gender identity."
EntitledPeople,fpa9pcq,t1_fp9mnam,1588443661.0,"Reminds me of the time I was closing in on 15 and expecting a call from a guy I had just met and really liked. 

Phone rings... I come running to catch it before my mom picks up and out of breath answer ""Hello""...

...just to hear him stammer on the other line... ""uhh, oh, ehrm, yes hello, may I talk to your big sister?""

I could have died.

He thought he had caught my 5 year old sister."
EntitledPeople,fpa8wrz,t1_fp9lxyl,1588443195.0,"sure, it happens like rape happens and murders happen. This ""tit for tat"" gender game is pretty old and women generally don't like ""winning"" at being victims.

This shit when men ignore the woman and will only speak to 'the man of the house', whether at home or at the store or car dealership, that shit is old and has got to stop."
