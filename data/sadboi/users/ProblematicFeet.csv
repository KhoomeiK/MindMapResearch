CatAdvice,fr1quz0,t1_fr0bbna,1589824399.0,"You should! I adopted a wonderful girl and after a few months it became apparent she’d love having a pal. I fostered cats until I found a little 1yr old girl that we both loved! She was snuggly with me and a rambunctious little thing with my other cat. They’re now even closer, and adopting the second cat was such a good idea. They cuddle and wrestle and play all day long. They nap together and the older cat routinely grooms the baby. I’m so happy I took the plunge and adopted another cat!"
PublicFreakout,fqzg9xd,t1_fqyge5j,1589766741.0,"Agreed. Imagine if this woman was your grandmother, riddled with dementia, and you heard about this. Idk about y’all but the thought of my grandmother getting essentially maced because she has no control over her mind anymore feels... unfair.

This feels like a “pick your battles” situation. It’s one old, senile woman against who I assume is a fit young man. He should have said his words and driven away imo. Save that energy for a more meaningful encounter. With someone who will preferably remember it an hour later."
ptsd,fqf4g2q,t3_gihlkp,1589318559.0,"I was THRILLED to get a diagnosis! I had been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety for years. It just didn’t encapsulate all my issues. Then I got a new therapist, and by the third appt she told me I’m a textbook case of CPTSD and PTSD. It was so validating and things have only gone up from there. 

I recommend reading The Body Keeps the Score. I read it shortly after my diagnosis and it filled in so many holes. I’m reading it again right now actually (been about 6 months since I last finished it) and I’m still such a fan. Good luck!"

CPTSD,fpclmft,t1_fpatpdu,1588505141.0,"I used that exact imagery when taking with my therapist. I feel like there’s a glass wall between me and the rest of the world. No matter how close I get, how hard I hit it, it never goes away. There’s always this barrier preventing me from being fully associated with my peers. 

Personally when I’m present, the wall still exists. I think that’s a result of the emotional trauma. Having a drink or two can help me relax in a group of friends but it isn’t a cure. It’s just a temporary fix. 

Your questions are really intriguing. Dissociation is hard to articulate and I think part of why is the inability to fully appreciate the times we *are* present. For me at least, I’m actually more comfortable in a state of dissociation a lot of the time. I try not to get upset when I’m triggered and allow my body and mind to work through it until I am more present."
SeriousConversation,fp9b589,t3_gc3lm5,1588421001.0,"Before I began therapy and meds I had a picture of myself as my background. It was because the picture was from a time I was doing really well. I was fit, excelling in school, confident. So opening my phone to that picture was always a reminder that I had the potential to be my best self. 

I’m sure it seemed narcissistic to those around me but actually I was floundering. The visual reminder was good motivation to keep my head up and take things one day at a time.

When I got into therapy I found other coping skills but I’m actually proud of myself for doing what I could, with what I had access to at the time."
AskReddit,fp8iz7m,t1_fp69x9k,1588393535.0,"Oh yes. It’s been a while since I watched, but as I remember it, there were a few big issues. When Patrick Dempsey left I was beyond upset. I liked him a lot. Then from there, it felt characters died left and right. It was extremely patchy and frankly ruined the show for me. All of these comments are finally giving me that behind-the-scenes gossip lol

I also want to add I really disliked Izzy’s character from start to finish. I never got much appeal from her. Sandra Oh is obviously outstanding and when the show lost her, I think that was the end for most people."

OP’s behavior is quite self-righteous, albeit unintentionally. I hope she has access to some therapy or other counseling. Six years is a long time to be living in grief. I can’t fathom her pain. 

OP, honey, pick yourself up. Would your sleeping baby want you to live a life of anger, hurt, and in isolation? No. Find a positive outlet for your grief. Make some art, join a local grief circle. I feel for you, I really do. My sister has had half a dozen miscarriages (finally resulting in her one miracle baby - literally, she has a unicorn uterus and her baby is actually a miracle) that really knocked her on her ass. She was horribly depressed. It might seem impossible to move on, but I promise you can. You just have to take it one day at a time. Sending my support."
AmItheAsshole,fp5r5hq,t1_fp4z802,1588337952.0,">They still love this angel, but they also have 4 children to look after and give their attention to. 

Absolutely. I fear what the effects would be on the 4 kids if their mom was always talking about Soulstyce. I’ve seen many posts about almost that exact scenario - “AITA for feeling neglected by my parents who refuse to overcome the grief of their passed child?”

Being a parent isn’t about yourself. It’s about raising healthy, independent kids with agency and respect. Reminding them, whether by insinuations or explicit references, that the parent’s heart is more with the deceased child than the living is very traumatic."

Even better if we avoid it and also feel better overall!

My cheek bones are far more defined, nose is slimmer and less bulbous. Jawline more defined. Breasts perkier and smaller, shoulders are more crisp looking. Eyes are bigger, smile is bigger and less pulled looking.

Edited to add: I feel this should be obvious but I’m not talking about already thin people. I’m talking about average to overweight people."
CPTSD,foc1hc7,t3_g6ne95,1587666056.0,"This makes me think of something that happened as a child. My parents had one of their employees (they were small business owners) come over to babysit one night. His name was Jordan. I remember being so uncomfortable with him and telling my parents so. He smelled weird, thats what I remember most. My parents didn’t notice it but to this day I remember thinking his “scent” was just ... unnerving. His energy was weird, everything about him scared me. I went to bed early and that was that. 

Well fast forward a few months and he stole hundreds of dollars from my parents. I think if he had stayed around longer it would have gotten worse."

LittleFiresEverywhere,fo996ze,t1_fo98stu,1587613491.0,"Agreed. I’m less bothered by Pearl, I view her as a victim and kid trying to navigate through all her trauma. And I blame that trauma almost entirely on Mia 

I’m also confused about how people are glazing over the detrimental effects of moving your child around for 15 years straight. Kids need structure. Mia provides the opposite. I was also surprised that for such a smart character, she was always oblivious to why “100 bedrooms” wasn’t as good as one reliable bedroom."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fo98d4u,t1_fo95i9h,1587612923.0,"Same! In a “real” hearing I feel like Baby M’s race would literally never come up, except for maybe a few minutes. It seemed to be Bebe’s entire case. 

Probably unpopular opinion but I couldn’t stand Bebe’s character. Her daughter was in a safe, warm home. She was taken care of. Her whole character felt enormously selfish. I really respected her initially but the longer the custody fight went on, and then finally by stealing Baby M, I lost it. If I had to pick a side I’d pick Linda’s. Bebe is living in her car, ffs."
LittleFiresEverywhere,fo97yg5,t1_fo8eubo,1587612650.0,"I agree. Mia was pretty unforgiving and relentless.

CPTSD,fnu3pp0,t3_g3rmwi,1587253933.0,"I’m not sure if this is the same thing, but maybe it is. When I was living at home (where the abuse occurred) I used to feel like someone was watching me all the time. If I was in the shower, I’d imagine someone could see me and I’d behave as though they really were. If I was alone I’d constantly wonder what people would think if they could peer into my life at that moment. It got to be a pretty dominating mindset for the time I was at home. Until this post I considered it the time my dissociation really took hold. I guess I still do, but I understand it differently. 

When I moved out, my stepdad actually installed cameras throughout the house. My brother still lived there and the cameras were often used to “trap” him or they’d play “gotcha” games. Really fucked up. 

I’m also extremely self-critical. I fully expect myself to do things perfectly. If my skirt pulls just a tiiiiny bit, I’m convinced everyone will notice. If my hair isn’t exactly how I want it, same thing. 

I had more to say but actually as I was typing this, I might have slipped into some dissociation from reflecting on my childhood. LOL. Of course. Love CPTSD 🙃 now my brain is empty and I guess I’ll go back to scrolling"

Frankly (this might be unpopular) I have very little issue with FTM.

In the show she was totally passing, in part because she was standing next to a 6’ 5” Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner. I imagine if I saw her in person it would be obvious because of height and foot/hand size.

Again, so happy to see a fellow redhead! I always looove certain looks but no there’s no way I could pull it off. Very pigmented makeup in shades other than beige, browns, golds, light pinks/champagne make me nervous. However, my eyes are green so you probably have more flexibility.

CPTSD,fn5a0oh,t3_fze1am,1586659553.0,"I can relate. You aren’t alone. 

My mom has said many times that she didn’t want kids until after she married my dad, and then it was more because that was the “logical” next step in their relationship. My dad already had a daughter and didn’t have a preference either way. 

My mom sounds exactly like your mom! She calls me (24F) all the time bitching and moaning about her job, but she does *nothing* to help herself. She is always making every situation about herself. If I call to talk about exams at school she responds with a much longer story about her own exams when she was in school. Things like that. However, unlike your mom, she doesn’t have any friends except me. She totally sucks at being a friend and making friends. (She ran into my friend’s mom at the gym and they talked for a while. When she didn’t see her for a few weeks my mom was acting all pitiful, saying my friend’s mom probably quit going to the gym because she was so annoyed by her. WTF.) 

Now that I’m mostly independent she always acts like I owe her something for being my parent. Like, what? She acts like the money she spent raising us made us indebted to her, both financially and emotionally. She even just demanded my brother give her the $1200 covid relief check coming from the government - for no good reason! 

I have many memories of her neglecting me physically and emotionally. My therapist and I have decided she probably has borderline or histrionic personality disorder.

CatAdvice,fgy9wom,t1_fgy7vav,1581181054.0,You should get a Feliway diffuser. I foster cats and it’s great! It’s made a noticeable difference. It doesn’t smell at all. It’s different than the collar and better imo

CatAdvice,ffjv24z,t3_eu0qvz,1580007744.0,"I agree, go to the doctor first. Otherwise I’d say return to the shelter. They vet adoptions much more than you could as an individual. And sadly, that matters, since some people aren’t kind to animals."
CatAdvice,ffjuxfe,t3_eu0v4p,1580007641.0,"Oh she is beautiful! She sort of looks like a Maine Coon to me. They have relatively distinct features, if you google them you’ll be able to get an idea of if she has any Maine Coon in her. It could explain her size - they’re large cats. Very large. 

Also, a tip I learned: Run your finger down your cats spine. If you can comfortably feel their spine, they’re at a healthy weight. There’s actually some videos on YouTube about it."
CatAdvice,ffjs7o5,t3_eu09sd,1580005524.0,"I would give it a little more time. It seems they are just taking their time adjusting. It also might be worth consulting with a cat behaviorist. They can maybe help to identify what’s causing this and how you can help the cats feel safe. 

None of it is ideal but try not to take them to the shelter out of exasperation. Try everything you can and be very patient. Good luck. :)"
KUWTK,ffi0ydq,t1_ffhuygm,1579961761.0,"I agree completely. I posted a pretty long, detailed post a while back. I talked *respectfully* about Kylie’s plastic surgery and commented it looked painful to live in her body. I had gotten some upvotes and comments when BOOM my post was deleted because I *pointed out the obvious.* and to be clear, it was about 15% of my whole post that got it removed! The rest was about the other sisters and people. 

I think the plastic surgery rules are the most ridiculous. Plastic surgery is a sizeable part of their entire brand. They literally don’t look like the same people throughout the seasons but... we aren’t allowed to talk about it?"
CatAdvice,ffdh5bp,t3_et0ycm,1579820758.0,"Oh I think you go for an adult. Kittens do best in pairs, for one thing. A cat that is 3-5 years old will be playful enough to enjoy your kids but not so energetic that your house is torn apart. My cat is 3 years old and she is super playful.

Edited to add: Plus, most shelters have bios on their cats. The older cats are likely to have the most accurate personality description, which is good for picking a cat to fit your lifestyle."
AmItheAsshole,ffc97g0,t1_ffc736x,1579794415.0,"That’s not the point. The point is that the experiences of each race are different. His children will each have a unique lens and interpretation of things, very different than he and his wife, as they are white. So, for example, the feelings of being a misfit or alone are not going to resonate the same way with the parents as the kid."

Edit: I just have to add what a contrast it is between she and her sisters in what they’re doing right now with their platforms. I really like the way Kim has grown into her fame. She is obviously very sharp."

lexapro,feltgc1,t3_eptteq,1579230510.0,"Hey! I have been on Lexapro since October. I also went in thinking Wellbutrin was the best medication for me, in part because my mom is on it and I’ve heard what works for immediate family members makes for a good measure of what to try. I think it’s absolutely worth it and I’m so happy I am on Lexapro. It’s been great for me. I had felt like I would never get better and this medication has helped me live again. 

I started at 5mg and certainly had side effects, but none lasted more than two weeks (worth noting I am in college too and attended classes during this timeframe, without any real issues). I was a bit nauseous and didn’t have much of an appetite. Oddly, the first day felt sort of like I was on drugs. I took my first 5mg and while sitting in class felt like I was pretty high. Through this sub, I found out that’s not unusual. That was the only time I ever felt that way. I did experience other side effects, such as being unusually thirsty, some minor headaches (easily fixed with Ibuprofen), and drowsiness. The drowsiness was probably the worst, but I was able to adjust when I took my meds and that fixed it. Also, I would take a Vitamin B when I started to notice myself crashing and it helped a lot. To this day I have incredibly vivid dreams (which can be good or bad, depending on the dream). No other side effects have lasted. 

I was also quite worried about my sex drive, for the same reasons you listed. I noticed a decrease in my sex drive but it’s picked up again and I’m so happy. It’s not just my libido, but my ability to orgasm is back! The few months I struggled have been absolutely worth it. I feel much better all around and I’m happy I didn’t let my fears around my sex drive keep me from getting on Lexapro.

I moved to 10mg, then 15mg. I’m currently on 15mg and it seems like I’ve found my sweet spot. I take 7.5mg in the morning and 7.5mg at night. All of the side effects, fear around my sex drive, etc. were worth it. I have C-PTSD and Lexapro has helped me take my life back. My anxiety is where I’ve seen the biggest difference, although my depression is much better as well. I used to fear absolutely everything and had anxiety attacks relatively often. I would lay in bed all weekend, in an almost catatonic state, completely unable to motivate myself to do *anything.* All of that is manageable. I have bad days but they’re not nearly what they used to be.  

Trust your doctor. :) And if you have questions, feel free to ask!"

CPTSD,fejnt4u,t1_feizotu,1579181066.0,I agree. I just read a post in AITA and a bunch of the comments were saying how divorce is NBD and holding onto negative feelings about it is immature and selfish. Uhhhh my parents’ divorce prompted my CPTSD and I strongly disagree it’s NBD.
AskAnAmerican,fejmm3m,t1_fejl0x5,1579179985.0,"I’m a woman and this is more common than you’d believe. I remember my mom was in charge of some home remodeling and the contractor would send emails only to my stepdad, and would always defer to him if he was standing there. If he wasn’t, the contractor would talk to my mom like she didn’t know shit and tell her they should wait for my stepdad before they made any decisions. He clearly didn’t understand that my mom was the one in charge."
CPTSD,fejl9w7,t1_feiqiz0,1579178716.0,"I think so. As I’ve been going through therapy I’ve learned a lot about my mom’s childhood. She was largely neglected by her parents and her mother in particular was quite mean. She would slap them, talk down to them. I guess she was likely a prostitute and would leave my mom at home overnight often to go make $$$. My mom never saw a stable home or healthy parenting. Now that’s how she parents me, and I’m trying to stop the cycle."

unpopularopinion,feip8a3,t3_ep9up9,1579143813.0,"Definitely. I have PTSD and everyone talks about weed like it’s such a magic cure. Well, I’ve been smoking for about six years and I slowly spiraled into an anxious and depressed puddle. If people had been more honest about the risks of medicating with weed, I would have been far more cautious about leaning on it so much. All I heard was it wasn’t addictive, had so many health benefits, etc."
CPTSD,feim76t,t3_ep8jn9,1579141794.0,"I can relate well to you. My trauma was born out of emotional abuse and neglect, so it’s been hard for me to fully accept that my CPTSD is legitimate. I don’t have physical scars, I wasn’t excessively beaten. 

My mom’s neglect of me seems to be rooted in emotional immaturity, narcissism, and a permanent state of victimhood. *She can never do anything wrong* and if you try telling her she has, then she EXPLODES into tears, yelling, shaking, turns red. Talks about how she’s such a horrible mother, I would be better without her, etc. and I eventually apologize and grovel to make her calm down. 

My stepfather and mother would laugh at me when I would cry or try to stand up for myself. They did this so often. I eventually got tired of it and after speaking up or getting angry, my stepdad started telling me that *I* was abusive toward my mom. My mom would also tell me I was a bitch for being honest about my feelings, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, then leave.” 

I moved across the country to get away from them and started trauma therapy. It’s helped a lot but now my brother, who arguably had it worse than me (he was emotionally and physically abused), is telling me that my diagnosis and refusal to “get over it” is just the privilege of moving away. He talks about it like I’ve been overly sensitive and he has even said, “Well I can handle it. Can’t you just suck it up for mom’s sake?”

This is all gaslighting and I’m trying my best every day to stay true to what I know is real. I’m sending you all the support, OP! We can get through this. Keep your head up. Your feelings are honest and real."

smalldickproblems,fedtgku,t3_eon8g3,1579019532.0,"I’m a woman and I came here from that thread. I just want to say, by no means do I think anyone with a small penis is an incel! That’s a crazy conclusion to jump to. I knew a man once that was on the smaller side. He was (and is) wonderfully kind, generous, genuine and intelligent. I only came here to get a better understanding of what feelings accompany that, so I can support men in my life who may experience feelings of insecurity, etc. 

I don’t have any advice (I would be foolish to think I could say anything helpful). I’m just here to learn how to be supportive. I see how society talks about men with small penises. It’s rude and dehumanizing. Nobody should face criticism and be hurt because of the way their body is shaped. 

Keep your head up :) (no pun intended)

Edit: why am I getting inappropriate PMs :( pls stop"
