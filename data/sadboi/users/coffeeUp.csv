Get up around the same time each day, but a tiny bit later since I don‚Äôt have 1+ hour commute.


Shower, normal breakfast routine, grab coffee, then head downstairs to my work area. I always send a sign on message (personal habit) to let others know I‚Äôm available.


Keep my head down in work, grabbing snacks as needed, etc. I make sure to take a break for lunch, for at least 30 to 60 min. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in work and not break away, but better to have routine continuity in breaking up work with non-work time. 2 - 3 days a week I use my lunch to workout (follow a fitness video with weights for ~45 min).


I always sign off around the same time each day, and leave a quick message when I‚Äôm done for the day. Some days if I have more I want to wrap up, I‚Äôll sign on again for an hour or two later in the evening (give my brains a break). But that‚Äôs not super common.
