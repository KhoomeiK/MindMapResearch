For me, Subutex or Suboxone has been very helpful in not letting opiate addictions get too far out of control. I went through the hard life of shooting dope/coke multiple times daily for 12 years and finally, when even $200/day of heroin wouldn't make me happy I finally gave up. I gave up thinking heroin would make things better. I told myself it would only lead to more pain and that I wanted *less* pain. 

I got a scary abscess on a bone in my hip once that left me unable to walk for almost a month. 2 weeks on IV antibiotics in a hospital and then 2 more weeks in bed before I was able to hobble out the door with a walker, walk downtown, cop a couple bags and shoot up with new friends in an abandoned building. Some of us learn things slowly and I'm grateful that I lived long enough to learn and somehow survive.

These days it's harder to sustain life as a junkie on street drugs than it was in my day. It's one of the hardest ways to live there is. Find a way out if you can. Use whatever resources you can gather up, put together a serious long term plan and then execute it one bloody step at a time until you're free and feeling stronger again. It takes a while but nothing is more worthwhile and life altering. 

Is a TC an option for you (therapeutic community)? Some people swear by them. I never spent more than 3 weeks in a rehab/detox.

Life isn't great now but it is way way easier. I still love dope but I have given up using it to improve my life. I have given up suffering from addictions for long.

When you give up thinking you can strive to hold back the pain. You let it hurt. You stop struggling. Let go of the steering wheel. You completely give up on it. It will only lead to more pain and in the end all you want now is less pain. It happens sooner or later given enough suffering. It took a hell of a lot of suffering for me and all my resources and strength. 

But it's not all for nothing - this total and utter defeat. The rawness of the struggle to exist anew without the opiate is an extraordinary transformative time I never want to relive. The person struggling to escape from serious addiction must learn more about what it means to be human than other people because life depends on it. A sickening but profound self-revelation is involved in the process. The nature of the ""I"" that craves and the ""I"" that fights itself. It's more intense than most experience.

Now it seems no one will come for my birthday and I won't have to host a party (something I've avoided all my life) after all.

It almost crossed my mind during an especially weird lapse in mental health that I was responsible for the pandemic because I had wished so many times that ""something"" would happen to make the party idea impossible to actualize. And it did.

In the Soto school Dogen Zenji has many mind-blowing essays but they take years to understand. Masao Abe is the scholar I've turned to for help understanding Dogen.

Keiji Nishitani and other members of the Kyoto school at Hanazono University have been invaluable in clarifying essence of Zen in the works of their predecessors.

The famous rinzai masters include Hakuin Ekaku, Ikkyu, Basui, etc.

I recommend looking at the teachings as put forth by the great Zen masters of old and make skillful use of interpretations or scholarly guides by reliable authors/professors. 

I also found some contemporary authors helpful but I trusted them less having not yet withstood the culling of centuries - the test of time.

I eventually went to the only zen priest in my town who ran a center and provided instructions regarding meditation. After a few years struggling to understand what was meant by ""meditation"", I started going to week-long retreats run by the local priest's Roshi and study turned away from books and more towards observing the mind very intensely.

This requires ruthless introspection and a profound understanding of what it is to be a human being. How we come to be as we are now.

It may help a bit to accept that perhaps you *are* different from the average person and always will be and to understand how you came to be the way you are.

And finally, to be willing to accept it all as imperfect as it may be and find a way to respect and even feel kindness towards yourself because you realize *none of it is your fault*. 

You don't actually need to conform perfectly to the ways of the average human to be a worthwhile human being worthy of respect.

Instead of trying to change into something you are not, instead of always trying to fix things by exerting control, try also surrendering to what is. Accepting your flawed self radically and sincerely. Putting aside judging and striving and let go for a while and try to enjoy your own perspective because it is as important as anyone else's. Your contribution is significant and you deserve love and respect even if you never improve at all. That's how I see it.

Embroidery,fn684ko,t3_fzolff,1586691130.0,Gorgeous. A ton of work but totally worthwhile.
Vermontijuana,fn655n7,t1_fn4fu4w,1586687832.0,Well said. We've all been there.
AvPD,fmzeyc8,t3_fy5umr,1586518036.0,Exactly the same.  I'm a senior too - about to turn 60.
SuicideWatch,fmsuosn,t1_fmsmh4b,1586362289.0,Let's not be too hasty to condemn. This person has been through hard times too and didn't mean to be insulting. A lot of us might lack social skills but it's not always the person's fault that they can't express themselves better. None of us can say we never did that ourself. Enough already.
fentanyl,fmstr8u,t3_fx8ivx,1586361875.0,"Have you done other opioids or opiates before? If you have no tolerance to opiates, the best advice is to do very very little however you do it, or else you'll just puke and feel sick (or die). 

A dose your average granny takes to kill her cancer pain might be enough to kill a person who hasn't been on pain killers for many years already.

I've done fent from the street and it comes in a powder so I don't have a clue what to do with a patch but I would probably start by cutting a small piece off and putting it on my arm or wherever and see what that does. If it's good, I'd try some of the other more creative ways I'm sure others will describe for you soon. Lots of knowledge in this sub."
suboxone,fmsctb7,t3_fx2r55,1586352690.0, Good post. Thanks for the reminder. I have more than I realize sometimes. I have enough.
Borderline,fmscmh9,t1_fmsc99y,1586352562.0,Thank you for this.
Randomawesomeness,fmscjom,t3_fx0ofc,1586352510.0,"As long as they also *taste* like cakes, I'm impressed. Evil things can be made to look spectacular with gobs of tasteless fondant.

Cakes are for eating."
OverFifty,fmsc9l3,t3_fwnf3z,1586352324.0,I have never been cleaner as well. I shower and change clothes after every venture into the world for essential supplies.
Borderline,fmsbw0p,t1_fmsbqxp,1586352073.0,"Sorry! I didn't realize. I too will go to r/BPDPartners. I didn't know about it till now. 

But my BPD loved one is my sister and I don't know if advice about relatives is included in a sub for ""partners""."
vermont,fmsbndc,t1_fms7pfg,1586351909.0,My iPhone 8 was not up to this quality. You must have a newer version?
vermont,fmsbbpv,t1_fms8vbm,1586351690.0,"We honestly never run into anyone. A couple nights ago a car full of dogs and probably humans drove past us and a beautiful Husky stuck his head out the window but that's rare.

Also, my dog isn't too social. Aside from me who she loves, she only allows 1 or 2 well-vetted humans to get within touching distance and usually only if bringing her high-value gifts -- like rotting carcasses. Our yard is littered with bones. Discourages home invasions."
vermont,fms838p,t3_fx50zs,1586349324.0,"In the meantime, hiking with dogs is heckin' nice too."
gudetama,fms7kbg,t3_fx2cns,1586348914.0,enviable
Borderline,fms7bu0,t3_fx45m6,1586348726.0,You might also want to check out the subreddit that's for people like you who love someone with borderline personality disorder. It's /r/BPDlovedones. Best wishes.
