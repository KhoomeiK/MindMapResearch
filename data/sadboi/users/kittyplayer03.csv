SuicideWatch,fqpsqph,t1_fqoeoag,1589553282.0,Thanks again. When my dad said those things I was scared that nobody would believe me about what happened.
SuicideWatch,fqpsi79,t1_fqod7fc,1589553155.0,"thank you so much. I do have an upcoming appointment with my therapist and I will 100% tell him everything that happened. I think the hardest part is getting through the mind games, because I really want to express how I feel to my parents but every conversation always ends up talking about me and all my mistakes."
SuicideWatch,fqpqwfq,t3_gjunvl,1589552282.0,"Thank you to everyone who has commented here. It really means a lot, and know that I will 100% support each and every one of you in turn. Your comments really made a difference and helped me feel better. I am so thankful for that. 

As for how I am right now, I'm better. Still am sore and stuff but feeling way better mentally. I think the worst of my depressive episode has passed, and I've had no urges to hurt myself in any way. My mother has been quite supportive throughout this whole thing and I haven't seen my dad at all (mostly due to working from home).

&#x200B;

Again, thank you all for everything. If there's anything any of you want to talk about, I'd be willing to. I know I'm not the best person to be giving out advice, but hey, one depressed lunatic to another. (thanks u/Anongraffiti for that awesome phrase!)"

donthelpjustfilm,fqm5s0l,t3_gabju7,1589471980.0,"In this case I don't think it would've been smart to intervene physically. This cops seems like he wouldn't mind tasering or shooting these kids. The camera kid was smart to film, as that can be used in court as evidence against the cop. If he'd attacked the cop, chances are he would be facing assault charges and other bullshit."
donthelpjustfilm,fqjyamw,t3_gd3nky,1589416970.0,"Based on the environment, it was most likely a garter snake. The only bad thing is that even though that species of snake is pretty much harmless, it was biting the fawn's nose. Unlike humans, deer, horses and other animals can't breathe through their mouth *and* nose. What worries me is that the fawn's nose would swell up which would lead to inflammation and breathing issues. I really wish this guy had helped-it's a tiny snake and he could've chucked it away."
donthelpjustfilm,fqjx03a,t3_gdib9e,1589416419.0,"''He's not gonna die''....well if it was a small garter snake than the dog would be fine, just a few stitches. But a garter snake it only about 8-12 inches long. THIS IS WAY BIGGER and even if the dog could escape, there would be serious inflammation inside his body. I can't tell if the snake was poisonous, but with that size chances are it probably was. What they should've done was get whisky or hot sauce and try to pour it in the snake's mouth and eyes. Snakes will reflexively let go if something like whisky is shoved down their throat, and they could use that moment to grab the dog. It sounds like there were at least two people there, so one person would hold the dog still to prevent him from making the wound worse while the other person would pry the snake off. They could've also used a stick to open the snake's mouth. But since these assholes didn't do anything, I hate to say that the dog most likely suffered trauma and severe internal injuries from the fangs, poison and compression that the snake was applying. Between the time that the dog was bitten and when he finally got free would most likely be enough time for the poison to spread in his body. I've known dogs who've had their legs amputated from snake bites EVEN when they got help at the right time.  They had their chance to save the dog while it was in the open. Fuck those people. I hope the snake got them next."
