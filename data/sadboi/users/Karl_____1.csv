Exercise, meditation, yoga and sexual activity also stimulate the part of your brain that makes you seek high-calorie foods during stressful times. Relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises and mediation, if practiced on a regular basis, can also help your body avoid the stress response.

Getting enough sleep can help your body when it is confronted with stress. A tired body can be more susceptible to the effects of cortisol production, so ensure that you get at least eight hours of sleep every night.
Medication can also help alleviate your anxiety symptoms, and may help you avoid reaching for food when your stress levels are high. Consult your doctor for more information."
