BananaFish,foww7nz,t3_g8ch0t,1588128477.0,"I've just resigned myself to the fact that Banana Fish is something that I'll never be able to fully 'get over.' It's been 2 years since I've first finished it, and I still get emotional over everything. I can go a period of weeks or months without even thinking about the series but one day all of a sudden, my brain will just be like ""hey, it's time to ride the pain train again :)))."" I guess it's just a testament to Yoshida's masterful story-telling abilities that allows us to become so thoroughly invested in these characters, that it's hard to detach ourselves from them completely. 

As masochistic as it sounds, I actually kinda enjoy the periods where I get the sudden urge to revisit the series. There's so many complexities in Yoshida's writing that gives BF incredible rewatch/reread value."
BananaFish,fowu6lz,t3_g9t3vd,1588127228.0,"When I first finished reading the manga while the anime was still airing, I remember feeling incredibly sick to my stomach the next week listening to Prayer X. The visuals of Ash tearing off his shirt to reveal his exposed heart which then leads into him drowning at the bottom of an abyss--was far too visceral for me knowing how his story would conclude. 

BF is the type of series that stays with you long after you've finished the ride, so I think it's perfectly normal to have the ED stuck in your head. That, and King Gnu just slaps in general lol."

SuicideWatch,f6ksdo5,t3_dkfkaq,1572919545.0,"This is late as hell but I've felt this way for years. I won't get into details but I've always felt trapped, believing that people like me didn't deserve freedom and that one day it'd come to the point where I'd stop fighting against my inevitable fate. Every time I take one step forward in life, something always happens to pull me five steps back...nothing ever goes right for long so maybe it's my fate to be pushed past the brink. Everything just feels so fake and hopeless."

BananaFish,f4cis1q,t3_dkarzn,1571529686.0,"Anything's possible in my opinion, although I will say I'm not too certain considering how hard it was just to get season 1 greenlit. If anything, I'm pretty sure MAPPA wouldn't touch Garden of Light since Utsumi has stated they wanted to keep the adaptation's ending ambiguous but Angel Eyes, Fly Boy in the Sky, and Private Opinion have a better chance at least. We can only hope at this point."

I'm incredibly appreciative of everything that she's done and level of craft that she put into her characters/story. It was only supposed to be a joke and I apologize if it came off as anything other than such."
