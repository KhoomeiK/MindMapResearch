depression,f88uh3u,t3_clue8y,1574361430.0,"It's not that I wish I could stop that thought. That it's just 'depression' and its not me to think I want to kill myself. Overall, its that I know how much I could achieve, and this crippling depression and bipolar that's been happening for years turns me into a shell of a person. I have glimpses of what my life would be like if I were normal. Times when I work hard for my future, make what I want. But most of the time i just see everyone and everything slipping away from me that I ever knew I wanted. The isolation from everyone, I can't connect with people or make friends when I'm like this, even the people who love me don't understand and become distant. I don't know. I'm with you buddy. If it stays like this. I know it's coming... I just want to do something crazy before it does. If you were sure, you'd make the most of the last moments. I will go far away to the other side of the world first. I travel so much now but I'll just decide not to come back."

AskReddit,exh5i7b,t3_csu2uf,1566292325.0,"hmm I've nearly died from a train riding accident. still have a lot of issues in my body because of that. i think if it actually killed me though it'd be quick and i would be enjoying myself, plus nobody i know would have to see me, so fuck it. I always imagine an injury making me paralised and having to beg for suicide by pointing my eyes at an alphabet on a card. that's illegal here so idk how i'd do it. yeah that's pretty grim."

I also respect your comment man, when i started there wasn't much, but yeah, it ain't gonna last for shit. not at this rate, well if you're referencing USA.

that was so shitty, feels like what apple do with their nazi software which makes you use and sign up for everything apple related with no cross-compatibility. anyways, when google bought youtube it really went to shit, with being demonetized so easily and all the algorithms, it doesn't really support independent new and innovative content now, and really picks the lowest common denominator of what works from clicks... i think it's really fucked the website up. what do you think?"
vagabond,exd0j08,t3_cs6z9r,1566164211.0,"Hmm hard to ride that far, pretty dumb too if you get spotted. But there are tankers that are good to ride, the naccos in europe and some other brand i can't remember, is possible to lie under the end of the tanker on some bed. done that before. glad you got a little fix of freight hopping lol, i need that right now."
