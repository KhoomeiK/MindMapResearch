I had high TPO antibodies which are usually present with hashimotos. There are different tests for different antibodies. I would recommend researching more information about autoimmune thyroid disorders (Hashimotos, Graves’ disease, Addison’s disease) because if it resonates with you, you will really need to be able to advocate for yourself. A lot of doctors do not care much when it comes to thyroid disorders."

She said my TSH was normal and I didn’t need medicine. In January of this year, I looked back on my lab records and realized she had also tested my antibodies and they were 135. I brought it up to my current doctor and she said that doctors usually don’t mention Hashimotos, but yes I do have it. Also, I went hypo and I’m on levothyroxine now. It frustrates me how thyroid disorders are treated, there needs to be more awareness about them or something."

depressionregimens,fjxgafh,t1_fjvkc1t,1583672200.0,"No, unfortunately thyroid disorders are one of the most undiagnosed/misdiagnosed problems in the US. It’s been infuriating and I’m still not getting the treatment I’d prefer because mine is autoimmune (queue doctors telling me there’s nothing I can do except wait for my thyroid to die). 

In the medical field you’re taught to treat symptoms, so physical illnesses can cause a lot of mental health issues but they will rarely treat the root problem. They don’t search for it. The reasoning behind this is because in the past searching for and attempting to treat the root problem rarely resolved a patients issue, but merely treating the symptoms did, surprisingly enough.

The main thing I’ve learned from this is that you need to be your own advocate when it comes to your health. Research, push for lab tests, and ask a lot of questions. If the doctors you’ve been speaking with push off your concerns, try to find new doctors in the area that take you seriously. It’s hard to find a good doctor, but they are out there. 

The same goes for the psychiatrist. When you have your appointment, if they don’t take your concerns seriously you can always find a good GP that might be able to help you too. There are some that are very knowledgeable about mental health, can do the same thing for you that a psych could, and it’s way easier to get an appt. Calling the office to see what treatments they are okay with administering (some will even prescribe ketamine for depression) can be very beneficial. I hope this psych will be a good match for you though and you won’t have to jump around looking for someone else. Good luck!"

My depression isn’t as bad now that I’m on the thyroid meds but my ADHD symptoms still need some work. Stimulants were too rough on my body so I needed to switch to a non-stimulant. 

If you’ve been on a lot of different antidepressants and they’re not doing it for you, I would push your doctors to do additional testing. There could be something else causing your problems. Either way, it’s a tricky thing. I hope you find something that helps you soon. I’ve heard about the genesight testing, it seems pretty useful.

Also, ketamine is very effective for severe/treatment resistant depression. It’s expensive but if there are clinics that do infusions near you, I would recommend potentially looking into that too. r/TherapeuticKetamine has a lot of information about it"

When I have a flare up because the inflammation is particularly bad, I get extremely tired, weak, I feel like I have the flu without having the flu. The way inflammation presents itself can be different. It can also just be brain fog and depressive symptoms, but you generally just don’t feel very well/normal and can tell something is off with your body. 

To name a few things that can cause inflammation... stress, certain foods (gluten is high on the list but not everyone has inflammation from gluten), and environmental triggers like allergies. 

Diet is a huge one for reducing inflammation. Reducing stress, eliminating allergy triggers (pets, dust, food, etc), and light exercise can also help. There are a few studies about LDN (Low Dose Naltrexone) being able to reduce inflammation too."

relationship_advice,f8sgypq,t1_f8s8m08,1574780446.0,"If she *wanted* to be in a role where she got punched in the face every day, would you be saying the same thing? 

Just because she says that she wants a certain role in a relationship, that doesn’t make it healthy. She can do what she wants, but this situation is still not healthy."
redditgetsdrawn,f8rebtx,t1_f8pplku,1574738285.0,This is stunning. I love your artwork so much.

Cosmetology,f8e6go6,t3_e0gm5d,1574519968.0,"Pictures? It’s hard to advise without seeing what you mean and knowing the overall condition of your hair. If it’s not too dark maybe use a color remover, bleach bath, clarifying shampoo, etc. Otherwise, you’ll have to bleach all of it and then reapply color. If you want light silver from blonde you should use a toner. Probably best to go to a salon and avoid further mistakes/damage though."
ADHD,f8ctyqz,t3_e046u1,1574469268.0,Ugh I always forget my drinks in the kitchen. I put my tea in the microwave earlier (yes i microwave my tea fight me) and then went outside instead of waiting one single minute for it to heat up. Ended up wandering around and finding a toad friend. Went back in oblivious about the tea until I wanted tea again an hour later lol.

AskReddit,f709xzv,t1_f6zd9w8,1573326090.0,Yeah anytime I hear someone start talking about some grandiose amount of money they made in a short amount of time 999/10 times it’s a pyramid scheme 🤢

Minneapolis,f61ivst,t1_f6120ba,1572640980.0,This looks like my favorite idea yet! My only concern though is that since we can’t get there until 8 most of the show might be over. Do you know much would we miss out on if we were an hour late?
