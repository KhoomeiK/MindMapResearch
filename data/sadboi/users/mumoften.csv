After a long painful time in depression I am now just starting to be able to move around and these are videos that captures these great days, while not perfect and not free of depression it's a huge improvement compare to just 3 months ago counting backwards.  


I hope these videos can inspire someone with depression that little by little we can do those laundry and cleaning made impossible with depression."
