Getting drunk it’s like I finally can believe the thoughts that fill my mind constantly. It brings a clarity that all these thoughts are real and not just bullshit I make up to myself. People call suicide selfish because they think the pain they feel when someone dies is greater than what the person was experiencing. They compare their own life to the person contemplating suicide and assume that if they live their life and treat it as a gift, then it’s like that for everyone else. They think depression is being sad about something. They don’t realize that it’s feeling empty regardless of what you do and being broken when you take a second to think about your life."

But if you’ve felt this much guilt over it then I’m pretty confident you’ll never put yourself in a situation where you’ll do the same again. 

As for dealing with the guilt, have you talked with the friend who forgave you about it? Maybe just be honest with them and tell them how terrible you feel about it all and how you feel like you could never make it right. They know you and the friend who didn’t forgive you much better than I do, so maybe they’ll be able to offer some better advice or something else to help you. Maybe try writing down everything you feel guilty for as a way of letting out your feelings. You said you don’t want to die so don’t kill yourself. You have a whole life ahead of you, and while this hurts how, think of how much of a better person you’re going to come out. I’m rooting for you man, you will come out the other side."

SuicideWatch,fhoy6fz,t1_fhnnblk,1581777604.0,"It’s alright, sorry to hear it’s still weighing so heavily on you. Feelings are often irrational. Many times there’s no good explanation or reason we have the emotions we do, we just feel that way. Have you had any opportunities to prove to the friend who did not forgive you that you are a different person? 

You had said that one of the friends forgave you, do you make any effort to be a different and better person around them? If so, that’s a big step because it means a lot more if you learn from your mistakes and alter how you treat everyone, not just the person who did not forgive you yet. In fact I’d argue that it’s much more important to act better around those who forgave you to prove to them they made a good choice in not giving up on you, and to prove to others that your asking for forgiveness wasn’t an empty apology. 

Stay strong, it hurts bad now, but each day it will get a little better and the more you learn from it and change yourself to ensure you never fall in to a similar situation, the less the guilt will weigh on you."

I’m sorry for what you’re going through OP. The above comment is wrong. Being in high school doesn’t mean you have it easy. There are plenty of people who will tell you high school was the worst time of their life. Keep pushing through and realize that many high school “romances” aren’t as they seem. You will find the person who makes everything worth it, maybe not in high school, but you will find them. Don’t compromise for someone in your high school because you feel like you should be finding your soul mate in these years. In fact, most people don’t find that in high school. Don’t lose hope, there’s likely someone out there right now who feels the same way, like they’ll never have that perfect romance they expected to have by this point in their life.

You’ve made your choice and I’m not posting here to tell you to change it. I just feel you shouldn’t go out without knowing that you aren’t the monster you claim to be. 

You say you’ve constantly been a thorn in the side of those around you, and maybe that’s true, but from what you’ve said, you know that wrongs you’ve done and it seems you feel remorse for them. It sounds like you wish you could have not been that thorn you believe yourself to be. If that’s true then that’s incredibly important because to show remorse means that you have good intentions at heart. You’ve made poor choices sure, and you’ve hurt those around you, but if you’re wondering why those people still care for you even though you feel like you’re a scourge on them, it’s because they see how much you wish you weren’t that thorn. They see that you care about them regardless of how you act because even though you have flaws you still didn’t forsake the greatest tie to your humanity. Compassion. 

If everything is as you say, then you probably don’t have much time left, I hope you spend this time relaxing and being peaceful because you at least deserve that. Don’t go out thinking you deserve to suffer, because you don’t. We all make mistakes, doing regrettable things, etc. Some more so than others but the character of a person should not be judged on how many mistakes they make but instead the pain it causes them to have made those mistakes.

As much as it hurts try to avoid blaming yourself. Everyone has to make their own decisions in life especially when they’re as important as the decision to kill yourself.

You’re right, many people only pretend to care to seem empathetic to others, but that doesn’t mean everyone does that. I’m really sorry about your friend. No one deserves to go through that.

There’s been a lot of people on here I’ve talked to who have told me they were going to kill themselves. I told them that I cared and that I wouldn’t forget them.

I hope you can stay strong through all this. One thing I will say about your plan, I’d ask that you reconsider opening fire on any police knocking on your door. With 9 felonies you’ve likely had some bad dealings with the cops before, but the people who would coming to your house are just doing their job, and likely don’t have any idea what your previous police encounters have been like. I know they get a bad wrap and honestly there’s plenty of police who are just completely corrupt and serve their own set of rules, but anyone knocking on your door could be someone with good in their heart just doing what they’re told. I ask that you at least consider from their point of view before you open fire.

It doesn’t have to be elaborate maybe it’s playing some video game together you haven’t played in a while, or messing around playing some sport, etc. The point is sometimes the best thing you can do is just be a friend that they enjoy spending time with because when so few things feel in any way enjoyable it’s nice to just do something with a friend. 

As someone who cuts I’ll tell you it is a really sick addiction that is easy to fall in to and hard to escape. You can’t make choices for your friend, but you know them, do what you feel is right for them. For me personally my friend saw my cuts one time and talked to me about it, which made me feel completely awful. That being said, if he already told his parents then maybe talking about it helps him. Try asking him if he wants to talk about cutting or anything else, if not, don’t push it, just do things to get his mind off of depression.

2. You don’t seem to understand the connection they’re making between when you’re asleep and how they imagine death. When you’re asleep and are not dreaming/ don’t remember you dreams then it just becomes a black spot in your memory. The only reason you know you were asleep is because you woke up at the end of it otherwise you’d be completely ignorant to it. Obviously when you’re alive and sleeping shits still going on in your brain and organs are still working etc, that’s completely away from the point they’re making. You’re just telling them they’re wrong for the sake of feeling superior because you somehow proved their argument was flawed. You added content to the metaphor and then argued against that added content to prove your point. It’s completely irrelevant to their metaphor. 

Just accept that no one knows what’s after death so you can believe whatever the hell you want. Someone can think they’re gonna ride a unicorn over a rainbow for all I give a shit.

SuicideWatch,fa6pw1h,t3_e7w66a,1575827374.0,Just be a friend and go out of your way to do things with them that they will enjoy. Everyone is different but in general pretty much anything supportive you do will help in some way even if it’s just for a short moment. Do whatever your instinct tells you to do because that’s probably the best thing you could do. You know your friend so do what first comes to mind even if it seems really insignificant like asking them if they wanna play some video game together or something else small like that. (Cause who doesn’t like playing video games with friends) Obviously that’s just a random suggestion maybe they like fishing or movies or a sport it doesn’t really matter just do something with them because that shattering loneliness really sucks and really controls your mind even when people tell you that you can talk to them.

I don’t understand how people can go to school/work/do anything in this world and actually feel happiness. I’m at the point where I honestly don’t understand how a person could feel genuine happiness. Sure, occasionally something fun or interesting comes along, but after that I’m just back to feeling apathetic or miserable. I wish every day that I wasn’t born. I don’t think that will ever change. 

As a side note I’m currently learning German although my vocab is very limited and I’m not very good at it."

That little spark in my mind telling me one day it gets better just causes me to feel like I’m not really sad about anything. It makes me feel like I’m deceiving myself for some sick reason, that I’m just making all these feelings up for some twisted reason. I hate it so much I’d almost prefer just feeling awful all the time so I didn’t have any doubts. I wouldn’t even call it hope for me, it’s more like I’m either miserable or apathetic and during the latter is when I have those thoughts. 

You saying it feels like you were fated to kill yourself hit hard. I don’t know if I feel like I was born with that as my only path but I definitely feel like the only way I’ll ever die is by killing myself or leading myself to death such as alcoholism. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m really hoping there’s no god because what sick fuck would seal me to this oblivion."

I constantly just sit there wishing I was dead. It makes me want to scream, or cry, or anything but instead I just sit there with a blank stare. I feel like I can’t tell anyone but at the same time it feels like I need to get the words out. It’s a weird feeling and one that unfortunately you and me are all too familiar with. 

On the bright side, you said you’re afraid it will cause you to kill yourself meaning that you want to be alive. If you have a certain pill bottle or method that you’d kill yourself with, maybe write a note to yourself so that you don’t make any hasty decisions. You want to live but feel like you can’t escape the guilt. You’ll find a way, don’t give up on your life if you want to be alive because you can work past this.

I’ve sat in classes endlessly thinking of how much I want to walk out and jump off a parking garage just to get out of this endless abyss. I do care and I know you think that’s bullshit cause I’m a stranger, but I’m a stranger who gets it. I’ve talked to so many people on this reddit who’ve told me they were going to kill themself, I talked to them and learned about them, usually knowing they were set in their decision as much as I wanted them not to be. I would send a message to them a couple days later asking if they were there... no response. I think about them every time I’m in a pit, wanting to end my suffering, I think about them. I remember what they said to me, what their plan was, why they’ve been led to this through years of suffering. I really hope you find something to make your life worth it, but if you don’t, know I will remember you. You think I won’t but I will. I get it, it’s your choice, but know I’ll hold memory of you to the day I die. I wish you peace friend, here or there."

Am I faking these feelings for some morbid reason? It feels so much like it sometimes but then why do I feel so miserable so often? What the fuck is wrong with me? I usually prefer feeling complete despair as compared to how I normally feel which is apathetic towards everything. At least when I’m in that dark pit I don’t feel like I’m faking it all. It actually feels real. And feeling real is a luxury I don’t often grasp."
SuicideWatch,f8rjvmd,t3_e1see2,1574742433.0,"Most people are scared to die. This probably stops a lot of people because they want to die but when they are faced with the harsh and grim reality of never waking up again they get scared and don’t feel ready. It’s one thing to be ready to die, but staring death in the face and walking towards it is another altogether. Also some people hold on to the hope that somehow their life will get better someday. Also people worry what their death will do to others around them. You’ve probably experienced one or more of these without knowing because while you’ve contemplated suicide, you haven’t gone through with it so something did stop you from ending it right in the moment. I’ve done the same, I think no matter what people tell you, everyone has some fear of death. It’s hard to not have some fear going into complete uncertainty. I guess the tipping point is when life becomes too miserable and despair outweighs fear."
SuicideWatch,f8rjftc,t3_e1shes,1574742070.0,"Please don’t tell someone else about it. At least for me, it’s hard enough to open up about how I feel, and I only have one friend who knows because he noticed. After he noticed I told him part of how shitty I felt but never mentioned that I have contemplated suicide or how frequent it is. Your friend is putting an enormous amount of trust in you and while they may be okay with you telling someone else, more likely it will feel like betrayal if you tell someone else without asking them first. At least that’s how I’d feel if my friend told my parents or some other adult I knew. 

Talk with your friend, ask them if there’s anything you can do to help. Let them know you’ll always be there to talk and that they can tell you anything. It’s a lot easier for people to open up if they’re not worried you’re going to share what they’ve said with everyone. If they say there’s nothing you can do then just talk with them like a normal person, do things with them that you know they like. To me it seems like people feeling depressed don’t want to be looked at differently or pitied, that’s how I feel and I’ve seen many other people say the same. Just be a friend because that’s what they need, they’ll talk things with you when they feel ready just be there for them when they fall into darkness because when that happens it’s so hard to see past anything other than complete despair."

I’m in a similar situation, holding on to something that I just can’t get past and it’s ripping me apart. I need to listen to my own advice and move past it. We both need to move on from what has happened or else we’ll always feel this despair. 

I’d say it’s probably normal for you to have felt better the last couple days then today feel worse again. At least for me, depression seems to come in waves, one day I’m apathetic and complacent with the world, the next I feel worse than I’ve ever felt before.

Just ask her to not completely dismiss you yet. 

All you need is that one chance and I know you’ll be able to get her back. Try to work yourself through this, I know you’re conflicted and feel like you should just end it, but try to work through it first. I get how awful it is to feel like you’ve ruined someone’s life. I blame myself for what I feel ruined my dad’s life and no matter how much anyone tells me it’s not my fault that won’t change how I feel.

Now it’s up to you to show him how you’re different now, to show him that he was right to accept your apology. 

Don’t dwell on what you’ve done, dwell on what you’re going to do. Killing yourself wont complete any debt, if your friend wanted some sort of return payment he wouldn’t have accepted the apology.

Sure you could make the same choice and betray a whole new set of friends, but why not prove to yourself that you’re different. Why not turn away from the chance to betray them because you’ve seen it before and know how it turns out. You can make that decision, it’s up to you to decide if you want to. Additionally, I know you think that if you kill yourself the people you’ve betrayed would be happy, they may have even told you that, but when it really comes down to it, as soon as they hear about it they will feel that empty pit in their stomach. They will wish they never said those words and they will wish you were still there so they could tell you they didn’t mean it. If you really want to make amends, contact them even if you haven’t talked in months.
