When Sasha Obama chose Umich, everyone around me was shocked at why she chose a ""redneck"" school. Very ignorant of them but that's the consensus of Umich based on my social group. Also, Emory is ranked higher on Usnews and much higher on Times WSJ us ranking. International rankings are for graduate schools and have a large slant toward research. You're headed to undergrad."
ApplyingToCollege,foxlr0w,t3_ga55ou,1588148027.0,"Emory has always been ranked higher, Umich isn't thought of that highly in the circles I'm in, however, because I'm well informed, I certainly know it's a top school. With that said. it depends on the type of environment you prefer and, what you want to study."

Do you need small classes to thrive or are medium size classes okay? Emory also has a PPL major if law school is the goal."

ApplyingToCollege,foouo1k,t3_g8oisw,1587946836.0,"I would go with Emory. Emory's computer science program has good placement despite it not being the best, but its data science program is top-notch and highly ranked. I would look into QSS and QTM. 

Emory is definitely worth the cost due to its flexibility, if you ever decide to change majors, you're stuck."
