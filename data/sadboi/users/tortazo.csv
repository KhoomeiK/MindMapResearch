Living in hypervigilance and being forced to develop coping strategies is great preparation for pandemic... This feels like business as usual internally, but having a tangible threat to label as the source of stress makes me a lot calmer. 

It feels wild to watch all my peers enter panic without developed coping strategies, and makes me proud of my progress and of the tools I have to offer.

At the same time it is heartbreaking to think about how other people are moving into this state all of a sudden, I've been in it all along."

ptsd,fistdhv,t3_f58r5k,1582692809.0,"I relate! As a queer guy, a lot of my identity and way I met community was through casual sex, and to have that become inaccessible after a trauma was really damaging. I also am at a point in my life where a relationship is not really feasible, so have had to find other strategies. Some things I've found that are helpful for me:

* Make sex with myself more creative and intentional. This includes masturbating for longer, using toys, reading erotic fiction etc.
* Have casual webcam sex. This allows me to connect with others and have creative and fun sex in a way that doesn't trigger me so I can remain fully present.
* When looking for casual sex, be explicit about boundaries and the fact that I am passionate about consent, without getting into why. I find this attracts people who will be sensitive to my needs and who recognize that deep consent makes things more hot!
* Cultivate friends-with-benefits situations where I can slowly open up and push limits, but also where if things really aren't working that night we also enjoy just hanging out, chatting, maybe cuddling. I've found this easiest to do with people who are in an open relationship, as opposed to single people, as they both have solid relationship skills, and also are not necessarily trying to escalate into a romantic relationship.

Hope this is helpful!"
ptsd,fissnfl,t3_f152jk,1582692240.0,"Yes! After a sexual assault, I fixated on that in therapy and thought that was the only problem. I attached all my other feelings from other smaller traumas to that event. It wasn't until I recognized and cared for how smaller traumas from my childhood and youth played a role in leading me into a situation where I was assaulted that I really have felt healing occurring."
ptsd,fisruz0,t3_evn0ta,1582691627.0,"I totally relate to having a lot of gender dysphoria after my assault. I'm a queer guy, and after my assault I was (and sometimes still am) horrified that people might read me as a man, realizing that most perpetrators are men. I also stopped playing into masculine presentations that are rewarded in my community as attractive. I grew out my hair, got earrings, stopped working out to get curvy, dress more feminine without being flashy. For a while I thought I might be trans but I realized this was just a coping mechanism that is now part of how I honour my experience and push back against toxic masculinity."
ptsd,fb1rnzs,t3_eb0e6h,1576440238.0,"I feel this big time. Am in a slow process of rediscovering my sexuality and what works now. Many of the things and dynamics I used to enjoy in the bedroom make me dissociate and are not fun, but also there are many things that I enjoy a lot more now! It is hard to focus on those and find partners who are patient and flexible but also very productive for me to do so!"
ptsd,f7jo034,t3_dwfoqm,1573782162.0,"I took time away from work for a year essentially. It was really great while I had planned things I wanted to do (volunteering, doing a 2 month meditation retreat). When I got back from the retreat, I was doing better but I had no other plans, and things got a bit dark and lonely, so I decided to go back to work.

Immediately got overwhelmed but negotiated to going down to 4 days a week which I am v proud of myself for navigating and has been a godsend in terms of keeping me afloat. Still struggling though. One thing I've been realizing in therapy is that a lot of my motivation at work comes from trying to prove to myself that I am just as capable as I was before my trauma, rather than being motivated by the work itself. Not only is that not the case, it is also very unhelpful and draining. Trying to work through it, but if I can't find motivation for my job I am going to start thinking of other, less stressful types of work I can get into that are more aligned with my current strengths!"
ptsd,f7jn3tn,t3_dwg6it,1573781533.0,"Hey fellow gay guy ptsd dude :).  As with the other response, I have sexual dysfunction when with a partner, and sometimes when masturbating but usually not as there is less stuff going on to keep track of. But yea with a partner anxiety often goes up, and if it gets high enough finishing is impossible. I found this very geeky lit review a while back that I found super helpful in explaining how sexual arousal is physiologically similar to trauma arousal, and so how it can trigger negative states when your brain is wired that way, and how it can interfere with your brain allowing your body to ""let go"" which is necessary for orgasm. Sorry you are going through this!
