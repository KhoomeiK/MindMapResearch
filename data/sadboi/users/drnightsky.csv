bipolar,fl3jig8,t3_fm8y15,1584786916.0,Lol!!
BipolarReddit,fl1lbcn,t1_fl0cj1v,1584731260.0,Kudos for keep trying! I did end my interview asking them to consider me for atleast volunteering in any capacity!  It was an NGO. I wanted to be useful. Put my education into some use. It must've sounded too desparate. I keep going over things I said or didn't say. It was a mess. But I am learning. Hopefully will get better with time.

bipolar,finskr7,t1_fimyx2j,1582569317.0,Thank you for your reply. I think I have broken many promises and thought BPD is making it difficult for me to keep them up. I feel like apologizing to everyone here :(
bipolar,fim6576,t1_filz92c,1582519260.0,"Hi, I  am sorry to intrude.  Do you mean you have broken promises or others in your life have broken their promises to you?"
BipolarReddit,fi9f0wr,t3_f7045z,1582263670.0,"It feels so great to hear you say that! Mustve taken a lot of effort. I had great scores in school. Never missed a class unless I really had to but everything changed once I started my college. First year was mostly okay. But fun started in second year! Missed most my classes. I didn't realise it in the beginning. Even I thought I was being lazy!! It just got way worse. I had to repeat one of my exams 4 times! Was the only one to do that in my class or among anyone I knew. But I did graduate in the end. I am proud of myself. No matter what anyone would say! 

May be many had higher expectations, that I would Ace my exam, start practicing straight away or continue with further studies. It  doesn't matter at all. I am here. Been stable for a while now. Have a lovely daughter :) a blessing ( touch wood! ) Have the support system to make sure she is okay at any cost. Content. Mostly happy too üòä take control"
BipolarReddit,fhzr6ws,t1_fhyko0s,1582008387.0,Every small effort counts! Please just keep pushing
BipolarReddit,fhzr0v3,t1_fhyn0lj,1582008205.0,"Yes, one step at time!! :) We are all here"
BipolarReddit,ff0k09r,t3_er0qhc,1579469562.0,"That's exactly how I feel in my down times. . . I have been in and out of many. It's hard. I can't say you get used to them. 

I can't relate to the people around me, or make them understand what I am going through. Sometimes they do try. Few of us are lucky to have somebody who also understands. 

I didn't know about this community back then. But we are all here now. I really feel strange sometimes, when I read someone posting about something that I felt and thought at that time that it was only me who was having these thoughts or experiences. Now it's strangely comforting . I don't know if I should put it that way. But when I found about bipolar illness or initially when I was diagnosed with depression, mostly it was thought of as an excuse for something or that I just made up things. Nobody wanted to believe. 

First step in dealing with a problem is knowing it right?! Atleast now I know. And they know. That was my first win. 

On difficult days I used to say 'just breath!! that's enough now. . .'"
bipolar,fekqvfb,t1_fejo08f,1579205732.0,Will look forward to see it :) pls do post when done

BipolarReddit,fb1ifmw,t3_ear9b0,1576437380.0,"Thanks for taking your time out to reply. Guess we are all on the same boat one way or other. Doubts have been a constant factor. The uncertainty of it all. It certainly is very difficult when you aren't very sure of what to expect. So many factors involved. Before you start showing the symptoms you are one person. Yourbehavious is mostly predictable. Atleast to people who know you closely. Once you are affected with BPD nobody is certain about the person you are. You keep changing. Varying between two poles. Mild variation for some and a bit extreme for others. 

I keep asking myself, ' Who am I? Which version?'.  I have begun to see glimpses of my old self again. That is the preillness version. Hopefully I'll get most of it back. And managing this amount of lifestyle changes is really commendable. Good luck with your journey."
BipolarReddit,fb1g3a3,t1_fb0703k,1576436423.0,"I remember reading the book but it's hazy. Was in between episodes and may be some drugs I was on had effect on my memory. The ECT round wasn't that long ago too. Before this, I had very good functional memory. Reading it did cheer me up, gave me some extra hope. But I lent that book to my psychiatrist thinking he would understand that I can do more. I can aim to be like her. Try and unravel the mysteries of mind, do research. Become a neuroscientist perhaps. It was just an idea in mind may be still is. I am from India. Here the chances of making it real are very slim right now. I have a two year old daughter and my whole support system is in my hometown. Yes, my career is important. Meds help in managing illness to a certain extent but having a reliable support system close by has made a huge difference. May be I am being limited in my thinking and approach. May be I am not trying hard enough. I am just not sure. For a long time I remember saying to myself 'Just survive today. Don't expect anything more from yourself- Just hang in there, Just breath ' I have come long way since then. May be I can keep moving forward from here too. . . 

P.S: Thanks for the reminder. I'll probably go back and look."
bipolar,fah2yvb,t3_e8ilhk,1576077961.0,Makes me want to smile too :) She must be super sweet.
BipolarReddit,f77fhts,t3_dul1cz,1573454342.0,"I was just wondering the same. My daughter is small. She doesn't probably understand or be able to judge my mood that well yet. I was having a bad day today. It made me think about how it would affect her. . . Also when these thoughts crop up , they even go to places like , ' I shouldn't have had a kid, I shouldn't even be married!' I don't know how to avoid these. Meds help with low moods. But only so much . . ."
