Trucks,fo89pif,t1_fo7lr5z,1587592452.0,"Your tire's diameter is also a factor in the driveline rotation. The larger diameter effectively heightens the overall gearing, ie 3.73 + 31"" might be oem but if you slap something big like a 37"" then that 3.73 is effectively like a 3.30 or something smaller. So, by going bigger on differential AFTER big tires is like trying to get back to that oem sweet spot, but with more overall rotational mass. 

So you're not really going to gain acceleration, more like recover some of what was lost. Further, at any constant cruising speed, the engine has to turnover more times to maintain similar speed so yes better torque band usage but also more fuel consumption at nearly every speed"
Trucks,fo893x3,t3_g66b9a,1587592136.0,"How's it's hold 75? If you're going a bit faster, overdrive should engage because overall RPM would be higher and hopefully closer into the peak of your power band.

Trucks,fo7eosf,t1_fo7dymn,1587577058.0,"Changing differential gearing after upsizing tires, ie; 3.73 + 31's to maybe 4.30 + 35's will keep the running RPM closer or hopefully higher than the original range before adding the big tires, but that still doesn't fix the lack of torque. Spinning the motor more is just more wear and less fuel mileage for less performance, though it should help bring back some of the lost acceleration at the expense of top end cruising speed"
