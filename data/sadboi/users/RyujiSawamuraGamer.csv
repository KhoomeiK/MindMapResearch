I know many introverts are better at reading social cues and signs compared to most extroverts."

dating_advice,fgpifqt,t1_fg711z0,1581005428.0,"Bro I'm pretty sure you're trying to help, but you can say it nicer than that. I am currently seeing a Psychologist.

You have to try to understand that this is a big thing for me since I used to be really bad at talking with women. 

And actually I've dated a lot of women, and some really attractive ones these past 3-4 years.

My advice to you is try to be more empathic because  everyone is different, and honestly you sounded like an asshole in your comment. It doesn't hurt to be a little bit nicer even on the internet."

dating_advice,ffto1nl,t1_fftnte2,1580225354.0,"The hatred came from so many rejections, but also came from me taking them personally. In reality though, rejection is almost never personal. 

I also read that successful people went through a whole ton of rejection.

When it came to dating, even the men who were viewed as attractive were also rejected a lot, especially at first."

AskReddit,f1m2rnr,t3_d9urph,1569582068.0,"1) Start working on yourself like right now!

2) Stop caring about what other people think because nobody is actually thinking about you at all.

3) Go do those things you want to do now because you might not have a chance to do those later in your life.

4) Adapt a growth mindset because any skill can be improved with consistent and hard work.

5) Stop worrying so much, most of the things you worried about these past 10 years didn't actually happen, or weren't so bad when they happened."
dating_advice,f1m2k6t,t3_d9sd5k,1569581804.0,"If you're a virgin guy, then you just need to work on two things:

1) Yourself - go to the gym, eat healthy, wear better clothes, get a nicer haircut, work hard at your career, travel, get a cool hobby, etc.
2) Your flirting/dating/seduction skills - actually go on dates! Go talk to girls normally just to practice. Ask a girl out because you have nothing to lose. While on a date, try to actually flirt with her. Invite her back to your place or somewhere private like a hotel.

If you do these things then you will probably lose your virginity sooner than later."

AskReddit,eoralcz,t3_amfl2h,1558803525.0,"I'm 26 years old. Never had a girlfriend. Dated a lot of women and hooked up with a few. Sometimes I get insecure of other people who already had at least one relationship, but whenever they tell me stories of how stressed and unhappy they are, my insecurity goes away immediately. Some people judged me for being still single at this age, at first it bothered me but I learned how to not give a damn what other people think.

&#x200B;

My main fear was that the women I date will be immediately turned off if I mentioned that I never had a relationship. It turned out that the women I dated, even the attractive ones, didn't mind at all. I was worried for nothing. Also, I had a valid excuse: focusing on my studies and being an extremely shy guy when I was younger especially in my teens.

&#x200B;

Now I'm focused on working on myself and my career, but at the same time, I'm open to meeting new women for a potential (first) relationship."
