lgbt,fqaux32,t1_fqarmru,1589225710.0,"Thank you! That’s very helpful. I’ve never heard of heteroflexible or biromantic heterosexual, so I’ll research that. 

I appreciate the advice of just vibing. I probably need to be less in my head about this and listen to my body more. 

I have also questions about my gender identity as you picked up. I do express a bit more effeminately at times and that has created problems with female partners before who were looking for a classically masculine partner.  

Thank you for offering to answer further questions! How did you figure out that you were bi and nb if I may ask? What was that journey like? I imagine it has to have been difficult at times."
dating_advice,fipg595,t1_fipe7k7,1582605972.0,This is true but it’s not so simple for everyone. Some people just have health issues that they carry with them. Yes you should work on yourself before involving others but don’t turn that info perfectionism because that can turn into you feeling unworthy of having a partner. We’re all flawed. Do the best you can. Don’t try to date in an immediate mental health crisis. But everyone deserves to be loved period.
BPD,fgkrlm1,t1_ff7pm6i,1580872057.0,I’ve done this all my life too since I was like 5 years old. Partially because I imagined someone was watching I wanted them to have all the context and now just judge me based on observation.
LifeAfterNarcissism,fghz73m,t1_fgfou25,1580798678.0,"Also narcissists can sometimes marry people who were raised by narcissists since that’s their model of what a partner is like. And borderline can often be a reaction to childhood emotional abuse which narc parents of course can can be great at. 

And the children of those couples then get borderline and narcissistic traits from imitating their parents, from their genetics, and from their own personal trauma. 

Often this is multi-generational as well, so the whole extended family can be full of toxicity and trauma, hurt animals, blindly swinging without even realizing what they’re doing or why. 

Not that I have any experience with that. I’m not a narcissistic. It was all my upbringing’s fault. /s"
LifeAfterNarcissism,fghyfs4,t1_fghalsj,1580797913.0,"So I was raised by a narcissist I’m realizing at the same time that I’m realizing that I am one myself. It’s pretty scary to be honest when other people spell it out I totally get it. But the narcissism just sits so deep. Like I don’t think I’m smarter or better than everyone else consciously but there is this unuttered assumption deep within me that I am better but I don’t realize that because I don’t think I’m better then other people I just “know” and I show it by being always a critic never a creator. 

You can actually get better as a narcissist  but the victories tend to be temporary. I’ve done a lot of introspective work on myself and realized through brain reconfiguration of various sorts how I blind I was to what an asshole I was to people and actually apologized although I didn’t always apologize properly because I didn’t even always remember what I had done wrong just a vague emotional feeling that I had wronged them. 

And that work lasted me for a while but then one day my first new lie snuck back into my life and I justified it because it was the better choice ultimately for everyone of course. But then that choice to lie becomes a new axiom for your behavior and so the rationalization, compartmentalization, denial shit starts piling up again. 

It’s scary because who’s in control of you? I don’t really feel like I’m in control, which is also a wonderful excuse. Narcissism is like this perfect mindfuck that is done to you when you’re still very little but that you then start doing yourself before you can even think cognitively. 

I think the only way to be a narcissist that’s not actively hurting people is with extreme honesty. I’ve had the theory before that we should be honest about everything all the time and then the world would we a better place and I even wanted to write a blog post before I got distracted by something else probably less noble I don’t remember. 

But that’s such a narcissist way of looking at things: lIf I’m going to be honest, I have to be honest all the time forever.” Instead of you know realizing we’re all humans an that we make mistakes and that you should own up to them. No that would be too much. 

It’s just hard to break these mental chains. And you have to keep at it. Do therapy. Learn how to apologize properly and mean it. And the hardest of all accepting it’s your responsibility to not be terrible person when that terrible shot you do is compartmentalized and often drilled into your consciousness through imitation or self-defense. 

But would you look at the time. I made it all about myself again."
TheExpanse,fg4sdvw,t1_fg3hu6f,1580510060.0,I actually think that makes it more powerful. Stereotypes often come from a true place but that doesn’t mean that they’re always true. I see that “skinny” as a racist slur and racists never were big fans of facts or accuracy.

SuccessionTV,ff5foat,t1_f3omeba,1579590820.0,"I think she does love him. But she was raised in an abusive household and her father and maybe even her mother both use love as a weapon with which to manipulate others. We learn a lot as children simply by imitating our parents. Monkey see. Monkey do. 

She’s just behaving the way she learned to behave. Sure she’s also a manipulator and knows that on some level and she’s responsible for her own actions. But she’s likely never had role models for any other kind of different possible path with which to treat others. She’s probably had to behave this way since she was a child to not get emotionally or even physically abused by her father and it seems her mother likely didn’t stand up for her either. 

We all have the chance to not be defined by our upbringing, to not let the bad things that happened to us or that we learned as normal to determine the whole outcome of our lives. 

I think as manipulative as she is we learned this season that she’s also not as smart as she is and I think a lot of her behavior is still just instinctual defense mechanism that she picked up as a child. She is a manipulator but it’s so normal in her environment it’s second-nature—like a fish in water she doesn’t see it. 

Tom opening up to her gave her a chance to see those blind spots. But if that fundamentally changes her as a person remains to be seen. Redemption is possible, even in small ways. But often it never really arrived."

menwritingwomen,fefq6ki,t1_fee9dyt,1579062073.0,"Yeah in Pillars of the Earth the narrator is always written through the minds of the key characters. This guy is a rapist and murderer and this is giving us a view into his mind. 

Proud can mean prominent but she also rejects him earlier in the story by refusing to marry him, so I think the “proud” is also meant to hint at her defiance of his will which is one reason he ends up raping her. 

She also is a very strong character who goes through a lot of growth over the course of the book and when the narrators shifts to her perspective the writing style of the narrator changes."

PoliticalDiscussion,fdilvoy,t1_fdg9aae,1578445810.0,"It’s not a mistake for Trump or the military-industrial complex. Wars tend to shore up domestic support for a leader amongst moderates. 

Also there will be immense profits for the arms industry. Sure it’ll be disastrous for common people in Iran and perhaps long-term it may weaken US hegemony over the world but a war with Iran would absolutely be a good thing for private military interests and it also is necessary for any empire to make an example out of its enemies every once in a while to keep other nations in line. 

I’m not supporting that ethically at all. But I’m saying Americans love to pretend that its imperialist wars are technocratic mistakes when in reality they are calculated decisions of empire. For example Vietnam. The truth is empires feed on human blood misery and convert it into power and profits. Sure the US is not monolithic, but the US has always been at war with someone to justify its own perpetual overreach. These are not mistakes, these are calculated decisions to further the empire"

BreadTube,fdg46i7,t1_fcvv8c4,1578379343.0,"Nietzsche argues that jealousy should not be a source of shame but a guiding light that shows us what we truly want for ourselves and a motivator. 

That’s to say we all feel jealous and I don’t think we should feel guilty for jealousy. Wallowing in jealousy until it turns into resentment or hatred—that is morally indefensible. 

But jealousy is just a natural human emotion beyond your control. When you practice mindfulness you can learn to recognize jealousy, to forgive yourself for it, and to use it as motivation to pursue the things you want in life. 

I know that’s easier said than done. I have solidarity for all my fellow humans who struggle with basic human necessities because we live in such a profoundly unequal and unjust world."
BreadTube,fdg3ot6,t1_fcw1ueu,1578378820.0,"It’s also because we live in an individualist, capitalist, consumerist society. We’re indoctrinated to believe change can only happen through self-improvement instead of collective improvement of our environment.

I think there’s truth to truth to the idea that we should probably try to improve ourselves before we turn our noses at other people. At the same time, the American mentality of self-improvements coincides with a toxic isolationism and perfectionism. 

I think we must acknowledge that we are flawed animals and that that’s okay and that flawed animals being there for each other when in need is what the human community is about as well. 

A quest for personal purity is still ultimately a self-involved task—and when I examine my own psychological drives for displays of personal purity I’m usually left ashamed of myself and have to acknowledge it’s more about an ego-driven desire to be special than about having the biggest positive impact.

I’m not saying that to judge it as selfish. As an analogy, not eating meat is a great thing you can do to combat climate change, but it won’t save us from climate change, and neither will reactively chastising meat eaters on Twitter every time I’m emotionally triggered.

This idea that people are beyond redemption and rehabilitation. For all it’s supposedly progressive posturing that world view is very small-minded and damming. It makes me think of Maoist struggle sessions. These people think they’re being progressive but it seems their morality is still very much based on the conservative, Christian nature of their culture. These people don’t think for themselves and abuse the language of leftism to elevate their own status by pulling others down. Nietzsche would shudder.
