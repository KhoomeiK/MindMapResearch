Choices,fr3mtgg,t1_fr3kd24,1589860931.0,"it’s one of my favourite books! i think a certain part of it is because it’s literally 5 year old me’s dream but I loved the storylines and how it made you care for patients. it was interesting how they played with the idea of right and wrong (especially in oh2 with a character that could be considered morally grey) also, the LIs are great, and I’m a sucker for a good romance. I definitely liked our roommates and colleagues too! except for that rat >!landry!<"
Choices,fqszuwh,t3_gjymvu,1589625012.0,I love it! I didn’t spend that many diamonds on it because I didn’t have a lot but I loved it so much. Will probably play though it again once I finish most of choices’ books.

I went back and renamed her Ella then kept the default name (Jordan) for HSS. Kinda sad I couldn’t keep the HSS MC but rename her so she’d still get to be with Michael :("

Choices,fq8rcka,t3_gcaubi,1589173370.0,I guess he felt like he was forced to but the sabotage could’ve endangered patient lives! (Got some of this from another reddit post btw) Removing the chart could mean that the nurses/other medical staff couldn’t read it and know information at a glance. Turning off the pager could mean MC couldn’t be reached during an emergency. Landry is just lucky no patients were harmed.
