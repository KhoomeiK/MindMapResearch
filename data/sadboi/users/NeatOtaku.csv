This is why fox News is full of adds like; ""buy gold because money will be worthless someday"", ""buy this 100k bunker before the bombs drop"", and of course the nra kept putting adds telling old people to buy guns because Obama will try to take them from you. When you are under constant stress you will look for anything or anyone who could possibly be at fault, and fascism grows in that uncertainty. Basically fox News is purposely scarring people into becoming fascist so they can buy their products.
