A+me crazy high monkey sex drive. Daily for probably the first 5 years,  at least weekly now
B+me multiple times daily,  then daily,  now several times weekly,  
My drive (CIS white gay male,  47) is 3-10 times,  with a partner,  or solo,l

We all started out going at it like monkeys. My drive is higher than both partners,  so I win. 
A is currently lower drive than b, so they both studio win. 
We sometimes have scheduled get together days,  though as we're all busy adults,  it's when time allows"
askgaybros,fee9deu,t3_eopqtm,1579029097.0,"For context: It's been a while, but i've had it done 3x all military, so not a lot of gentle there.

It's not bad, honestly. Maybe sort of a pressure thing, similar to giving yourself a good squeeze while erect. Really, not as bad as taking a good strong whiz while there's a burning sensation.

We also called it ""getting rodded"" as when doing live fire training, they'd run a brass rod town the barrel of our rifle to make sure there was no blockage/debris/ammo in the barrel :p"

I know a local to me guy, Fairly nice guy, similar situation, he's older than me, single, always been single, pretty unhappy.   
He's not an unattractive dude, he's just a bit more eccentric than what even I am used to.  


If you have in your social media photos:  
Disney cartoon bed sheets, surroundings of littlest angels figurines, faux animal print, velour covered everything, and or 1/2 of every Tupperware piece ever made, but not the other half...  
It might not be the gay community, but your personal interests.  


I like a lot of things, and have my own eccentricities. I even like this guy, as a person. I just can't get into a person who is telling me how horrible everything in the world is, while also posting about still using the peanuts cartoon bed sheets they grew up with (they're over 50), a house full of ""tiny treasure"" figurines and just kind of a 1970s Avon catalog lifestyle.   
If a person wants to have their personal space be personal, Awesome, i'm all for it. That same person is being unfair, when they tell the rest of the world, how crappy it is, because we'd like them to more closely conform to what we're used to, in order to have traditional adult style relationships."
askgaybros,fds41f6,t3_emxuik,1578693929.0,"You're not a ""pansy"" that's a flower.  
It's Your body, and Your sex. You're Having sex with him and you both get a say.  
If you're not enjoying it, even in that moment, you stop. Literally. Stop, say, ""look, this isn't what i want"" or ""yeah, no"", or something similar. You need to assert yourself, and the two of you need to get to an understanding. Life isn't rough trade locker room frat jock porn, it's life.  
I personally, am not up for slapping my ass, talking trash and expecting me to call you daddy. I Can do the other side of that coin, but not receiving it, no. Sex, vanilla to kink, is about owning Your self and owning Your sex. Consent stops with No. Even mid stroke of either of you, it stops when one of you say stop, or other, agreed upon safe word."

Truth: You'll be fine, explain that you've never done this, ask them to be patient, use lots of lubrication and condoms, do your part to clean up outside, if not also inside. Sit back and enjoy the ride"

lgbt,fd9qz6d,t3_ekal97,1578236936.0,"Thanks for reaching out for help, that's an important bi step. If you were AFAB (assigned female at birth), and present feminine, and feel the need to confirm to gender norms, that's OK, it's normal for anyone at any age to feel the need to conform, even if it isn't who we are.   
Have you talked to your boyfriend about your actual gender/gender identity? Can you explain to him that physical interaction is uncomfortable for you, and that if you could take the lead, and set boundaries that it might be easier?

He could be that great guy, who helps you love your full self, and support you as you transition into the full you. You won't truly know until you try. It sounds like you've got a great start on both yourself, and a healthy relationship. You'll have to put yourself out there, and test some boundaries and test the waters a dozen or more times. You got this, be strong, be you"

askgaybros,fd5ufdq,t3_ek2s48,1578181633.0,"I think you're in a tough spot both culturally and relationship wise. I think that if your parents respect you enough as a person, to let you even have a boyfriend, and ask you not to sex up, you might want to negotiate that. Can you:  
Move into your own place, with our without BF, and have him over for sexy time.  
Afford a place without his support, or the support of your parents.  
Have an understanding relative who can help you work things out with both your family and your bf?  
Can your family afford the place you live without your payment/support?   
I think negotiation is the key, and that's probably harder than I can imagine.

I wish you both well, as well as your father/family. I hope you're all able to work something out."

I'm a member of 2 social groups (one is an add on to the other) and I meet people there, as we do a club dinner weekly/bi-weekly. In all of my app profiles, i state that I'm not looking for hookups, and that i'm looking to date and get to know a guy before we Smash. It sometimes works out. Sometimes, you just make friends, sometimes, you weed out the guys who are not the type of weirdo that you're looking for."
