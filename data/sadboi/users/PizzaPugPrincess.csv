AmItheAsshole,fr5hwwz,t3_gmmlv7,1589908839.0,"YTA. Stop taking out your insecurities and jealousy issues against your sister on your poor daughter. 

Kids don’t usually always want to eat veggies. Fucking let her. 

Start small if you think she won’t eat it all get those kids snack size packs of veggies. If she likes them and eats it all buy more. Buy a couple apples instead of a whole bag. Most produce is open stock. You really can’t buy too much. 

Learn to eat some with her. As someone else who doesn’t love veggies it can be hard to find something you like, but they’re out there! Start by sneaking them into your other food (peas in potatoes, etc) then you’re both taking healthier steps together. 

I do think it’s important to love your body and there is a line where diet and weight loss can become unhealthy but I don’t see any red flags with your daughter or your sister. If your sister was taking it too far with her own body you’d see signs. What I see is you projecting your feelings onto both of them."
legaladvice,fr50cft,t3_gmlegs,1589900223.0,"NAL, but I sell on Etsy and this happens a lot. The worst thing that could happen at this point is they file a DMCA takedown request for copyright infringement. Now to have one issued, you have to be violating some sort of copyright. If you sell your stuff through a platform like Etsy they will look into this and make a decision. You could also report them for harassment if they don’t leave you alone. 

When you receive a DMCA takedown request then you just take the item down. No further legal action would happen. 

However if she’s claiming to have invented the pattern (doubtful) AND she’s created the fabric and you stole the pattern (again, doubtful) but didn’t, she really can’t do much at all. There’s a lot of people selling masks right now and it’s pretty common (sadly) for nasty sellers to try and scare away new ones with threats of frivolous suits. 

There is a lot of disagreement on copyright issues over a pattern. Many will argue that to take someone else’s pattern, make the product and sell it is unethical and infringes on copyright, but this is a legal gray area and it can’t really be enforced as it’s akin to someone trying to sue you for using music notes to make a song. 

Also, if you’re on Etsy there’s a sub, r/EtsySellers I believe. They can help you too!"

That’s like another month of content that hasn’t even aired on TLC yet. He has to do other stuff. 

Also, some of my favorite streams are ones when he just talks to us and we watch donos (media share is my favorite stream)."
PaymoneyWubby,fqt3uuj,t3_gklhwo,1589629090.0,"Sometimes I feel like there’s more drama about 90 day fiancé in chat than in the actual show. 

Wubby should definitely stream whatever he wants. Chat absolutely sucked him down this TLC rabbit hole with some crazy donos. We birthed this monster. 

Anyway, I hate the “just go watch it on your own” argument because when I’m tuning in for the 90 day streams **I’m not watching the stream for TLC, I’m watching it for Wubby’s reaction.** How’s he gonna act when Big Ed slicks his hair back with mayo and tells Rose her legs are hairy?!  Some people watch for the show and to those people: it’s online (obviously) and on on demand. If you don’t like Wubby pausing it and waiting to watch you’re not watching the stream for Wubby, you’re watching it because you can’t admit that you like the show to justify watching it on your own and you have to hide behind the thin veil that is “bUt My FaVoRiTe StReAmEr Is WaTcHiNg It!”

Wubby’s reaction is the TLC content I love. As for the show, I do watch it on my own and I’m really excited to see Wubby react to some upcoming shit. Sidebar: I was SO pissed when someone used TTS for a spoiler and I’m glad chat was too. This season is still airing and some mind-blowing crazy ass shit goes down in the next few episodes I was super worried someone else would try to ruin that. Because, again, I’m watching for Wubby’s reaction. 

That being said, Wubby is Wubby, Chat is Chat and Bait is Bait, but sometimes, in my opinion, Wubby holds the bait out a liiiiiiitle too long. Baiting is an art form and it’s not perfect. 

Wubby was clearly so excited for Dark Souls he should have just said “fuck TLC, we’re playing dark souls, maybe we’ll watch it later.” He was clearly having fun and I think that resulted in him over baiting a little. 

I think both chat and wubby need to bend a little (chat needs to bend wayyyyyyy more than wubby). TLC simps, sit down, relax. He’s going to watch it. Chill the fuck out. Wubby, maybe don’t say “just one more fight” and then play for 2 more hours. But mostly, chat needs to chill."

I know the greenhouse is her safe space but on a deeper level it could be that trapped feeling from Demeter and it could also represent Demeter’s initial desires to keep her safe and locked away as opposed to sending her to Olympus. Almost like, Zeus can’t get and take her away after what she’d done. 

Who knows. I definitely am not feeling my initial theory as much as when I first read it but there’s definitely something there that I think is a bit more than “Demeter is a helicopter mom”

Make it clear in your FAQ, shop announcement and listings that there are significant delays due to covid and people need to make sure they’re willing and able to wait for a much longer time for their order. 

Personally, I’ve had an order that I placed from Russia in early March that STILL has not left the country. In fact, it sat in one of its transit locations for an entire month. Is it annoying, yeah, but I don’t need it until September so I’m not going to freak out or bother the seller. They held up their end of the bargain and shipped the day after I placed my order. If for some reason it doesn’t arrive I’ll reach out to see if I can get another. 

It helps that I have tracking. I would make sure all international orders have tracking, always. Usually once it leaves the country of origin the tracking ends, but you can at least show that the package is moving!
