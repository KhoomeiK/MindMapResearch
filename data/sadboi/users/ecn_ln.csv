Anxiety,fj86y5q,t3_fc2uk9,1583106512.0,"Hey! I've been on Sertraline for almost a year now, after being on Prozac for 6 years. 
At first I was very anxious all the time (more than usual). I had no appetite and I've lost a lot of weight since starting them. I also found they made me very nauseous a few hours after taking them (still sometimes happens). 

However after the initial month to 3 months it took me to settle and for them start working in my system, I found my anxiety and intrusive thoughts to be much less. 
I am much happier on them than I was on Prozac and they give me a lot more energy, rather than being tired all the time."

Give the new dog time to relax and adjust to his new environment. It's possible he isn't playing yet because of never really getting attention from previous owner (by the sounds of it). 

He will come out of his shell and get used to things. The fact he is humping your female dog just means he's asserting his dominance since you don't have other male dogs. Even though she is spayed, he will probably keep this up for a little bit.  It's normal. 

Please please give him a chance, I promise you in a few months they will most likely be inseparable and the best of friends.
