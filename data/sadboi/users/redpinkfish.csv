stepparents,fqqcwmi,t1_fqppsah,1589563349.0,"This. My SO was conditioned not to say or do anything so he doesn’t. I have seen the proof of everything he has said so I believe him completely plus the more I get to know BM the more I see what he is saying. 
If you truly believe he is bad then you don’t need to talk to her to see that, you know already in your heart of hearts and you want that confirmed by someone else."

I think she ended up dropping out instead of transferring.
stepparents,fpg7qjm,t3_gd99i8,1588596554.0,"I’ve had similar (not exactly this) but I’ve just pulled myself away from BM. SO deals with her, not my problem. If he has a shift issue he coordinates with her, not me because ultimately the agreement is to see Dad, not me. I won’t do handover unless I have to but all I ask from him is that he keeps me in the loop with when we’re having SD. I would keep a record (it’s endangering lives) and use it if needs be but for the time being, and for SO to maintain a relationship with SD just step back."

stepparents,fpcfwt3,t3_gcle0d,1588499084.0,She might be scared or worried to talk to you about it (going off of my experience as a teen) and that’s why she hasn’t said anything. As an adult there are times when I don’t want to talk about my friend/family with cancer either because it scares me.
stepparents,foxp744,t1_foxmqcb,1588151391.0,"We have ours all the time and deep down know we won’t lose access to her but BM still controls the narrative.

She is an adult, she needs to wake herself up in the morning. That’s not his problem. Tell him that though! He is probably worried about access to his kids and therefore does what she wants, which is exactly what happened to me but after talking he started pushing back. I was very straight and told him that she was manipulating him and that I wanted the best for him and his mental health."

stepparents,foxkunp,t3_ga4xk4,1588147193.0,"Simply put, he needs to go to court. If it’s anything like the situation I had my SO was over the past, he was just worried for his child.

stepparents,fotz852,t3_g9fnzl,1588071353.0,"If he was that much of a threat the police would have contacted him regarding criminal proceedings which I’m guessing hasn’t happened. YOU are the one receiving death threats. You did it right by blocking her, that’s exactly what the police would advise, along with explicitly asking her to stop. If she carries on it’s then harassment. You need a custody arrangement for her to stick to, sounds like you are doing everything right so far though."
stepparents,fokggd2,t3_g7ooqd,1587841611.0,Yes I can totally relate! BM wants a mini me and tried to buy similar clothes to the ones she wears but SD refuses to wear them now she’s a little older. We’ve had her turn up in tights and layers of clothing despite it being hot and sunny today here. BM doesn’t like confrontation with SD at all so we assume SD is demanding to wear things and BM isn’t saying no.

I had the middle sister (14 at the time) come to me in tears because she’d been told her dad didn’t love her because he’d gotten married again.

stepparents,fn6xh05,t1_fn6sjwa,1586709254.0,"I’ve been reading a book called ‘the book you wish your parents had read’ and it’s so damn useful. Another theory I have is that a lot of people have band aid babies when their relationship goes wrong (and it makes their relationship worse), and also I know someone who straight up admitted they just wanted a baby and they didn’t care who with. I know a mum who has a crappy childhood but is stuck in the ‘good times’ of her childhood and forces her own childhood onto the kids (“you have to love Ariel the little mermaid because I loved it!”) Everyone needs therapy, that’s my theory!"

stepparents,fn6q7i8,t3_fzy3xj,1586705132.0,"Right, my theory is that it’s to do with 1. The ex’s mental health and 2. The circumstances surrounding the break up. I know of several situations where the partner (male or female) has left for someone else and has then gotten mad when the other has found someone new. They want their ex partner to be pining for them forever. People don’t want the kids to have another mum/dad figure. People can’t accept that their relationship didn’t work but their ex partners new relationship does work. The mental health theory comes from the fact that instead of accepting that they (male or female) may need therapy or support, they blame their behaviour on the people that they can (e.g. instead of admitting they won’t let the SO have the child, that parent in their head then becomes the crappy parent and they’re not pulling their weight). A lot of the time their own childhood was shitty and they haven’t got the emotional intelligence to fix it. This is my theory anyway, I’d love to hear others!"

He stuck his dick in crazy and he can deal with her shit! Just because I’m female doesn’t mean I’m maternal or wanting to be a mum, I’m her friend and responsible adult and as long as she’s safe and happy I will step away from that crap that BM brings.

stepparents,fm5dtg7,t3_ft0zll,1585771060.0,"I like this and I need this today for my own therapy:

Dear BM, you need to go to therapy. I like you but you need to settle down with someone who isn’t using you to look after their own child. A man you won’t even leave your child with?! You need to sort out your past and leave it behind instead of inflicting your trust issues on us. I know you trust us but your lack of trust in other people is now causing issues. Please stop inflicting your pain and issues on SD, she feels it and is so young. I wish you would understand that you need to sort your shit out instead of attention seeking and compulsive lying. Your behaviour ruined SO and will continue to hurt people, including SD. Realise that there are situations that impact a lot of people, not just you. Please, for SD, get some therapy."

(Just as a side note I’ve lived with SO for a bit and even I’m finding this step parenting hard at this time!) SD and I get along great and she’s quite clingy with me. SO was very jealous in the beginning but eventually learned to love it. I made an effort to include SO in everything we were doing and we’ve all settled into it now, it just took some time.
ETA - I originally felt ignored too and I can imagine it being heightened at the moment with everything going on. Talk to him. I spoke to my SO and he completely understood."

BM and SO are both key workers on shifts and it’s the choice we’ve made because SD physically can’t go anywhere else now without them taking shifts off and they can’t. It’s different for everyone but this is the only way we can do it!
ETA - SDs childcare closed this morning and I am working from home so she will be with me for the time being. We have thought it through and she is going between two households who both have key workers in them and there is literally no alternative when both employers of the parents have cancelled leave. To be honest I’d rather she was here than at a 3rd place (childcare facility), interacting with even more people. No one is vulnerable in our households and both families are following the rules so we’re comfortable with this. I would rather she was with me while BM and SO work their socks off and if it means both parents get some well needed rest then I’m ok with that. The minute anyone gets symptoms this will change but right now it’s working for us. What I will say is that this is different for everyone and this is a completely unprecedented situation, there are no rights or wrongs. Just exercise caution and explain your reasoning to the other parent."
