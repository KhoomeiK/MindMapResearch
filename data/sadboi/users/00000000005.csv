I used to check social media daily to keep up with what everyone's been up to but now I just see my family posting straight up DUMB stuff and I can't stand to look at it. I also don't want to cause drama by disagreeing with them because I've already tried and they just don't care. It's a pointless battle that they're not going to care about until it effects them.

relationship_advice,fo4hxys,t3_g5npxb,1587504741.0,Absolutely. There's a lot of changes happening and even if they aren't totally conscious of it the stress can be effecting you. One of the best things I've heard during quarantine is to live most comfortably and to do no harm. It's a very difficult time for everyone so do as little harm to yourself as possible but also relax. I'd try to be open with your partner about how stress is effecting your emotions. Be gentle on yourself and your relationship right now. Open communication can be the best thing.
relationship_advice,fo4hf73,t3_g5noq9,1587504472.0,"I'll be honest here, it sounds like your boyfriend isn't very mature. The situation with COVID has effected everyone so everyone has ""agreements"" that have changed. Of course you aren't able to pay your normal 50/50 share of things and if he can't understand that he's not looking at this relationship in a healthy light. Nothing is going to always be 50/50 and that's just how relationships are. Sometimes one partner needs more emotional support, sometimes one needs financial support. I don't think he needs space, I think he needs to grow up. He doesn't sounds like he knows how to have a mature conversation about the issues here which solely seem to be if the money. You're doing the majority of the house chores which doesn't even seem to be acknowledged! And frankly, when he says marriage would change that I absolutely don't think a guy like this would change his view on money if you were married. You sound like your heart is in the right place and I think it would be healthy for you to take a step back for yourself, not for him. When he says ""it sounds like you want me to solve your problems"" I'm reading that as him feeling like his money is being threatened and he's mad about it. It sounds like you both have very different expectations on how relationships should be and if he doesn't want to talk about how to compromise I think it's best to take a step back and evaluate if this relationship is really what you want. 

&#x200B;

I'd also suggest looking into state options for underemployment if you qualify to help you out since you've lost a lot of work. A lot of funded programs are being more lenient about qualifications. Best of luck!"
