BipolarReddit,fpdkltj,t3_gcrsy7,1588528839.0,"**ROUTINE ROUTINE ROUTINE**

I cannot stress this enough. I lost my routine about two years ago and ended up getting ECT....a lot of ECT, and it's been 18 months since then and I'm finally starting to get back on track. 

1. Take your meds. Regardless if how you feel. And take them at the same time every day. Your body will come to expect that and if you take them differently then youll throw things up. Also I'll assume I'm not the only one who talks meds throughout the day so I'd recommend getting a pill case. I've got a great one and I always have certain pills in there depending on where I'm going. Fuck me, I gotta go to a large family gathering? Shit yeah let's pack 5 Valium....that should do it. I'm telling ya - having a pill case always comes handy. 

2. Have one thing you can do that you love, something alone. For me it's working out. Others may read or do puzzles, paint, wood working, draw, sew, or just laying in bed watching Bojack Horseman for eight hours a day like I did for two months. But seriously, having one thing you can look forward to is huge. 

3. Communicate with your family or significant other if you get along. My family has been very helpful through my shit so I can only hope there are others out there who do have a good family. For the ones who don't - friends, your therapist, your girlfriend/boyfriend, your cat! Seriously cats are the best listeners. 

4. Keep a journal of things you feel are important. I track what pills I take every day. I also try to write one good things every day, regardless of how small or large it is.There's days I'll look back and just shake my head as I'm looking at a day where I took 6 grams of gabapentin. Which is exactly why I track that. Others might track mood to monitor spikes and lows, keep a journal stressors that cause you to do or feel something, or a food journal. All these fucking pills we swallow...a lot of them make people gain weight so keeping a food journal would be helpful in that case. Basically you just need to monitor something that you is an issue for you. That way you can look back every day and know exactly what you need to. 


5. I know you hate exercising but there are so many ways to do it. Running, biking, lifting weights, playing pickup basketball games. I'm very biased because working out is what keeps my life together. If I don't work out for a day I feel disgusting. I used to compete before my ECT. Then I stoped working out for a few weeks and just could not go back. Now it's 18 months later and I'm getting back into it. But I would highly highly highly recommend trying to find some sort of stimulation for your body. It literally helps every single aspect of your life.


6. Realize that we are different. Embrace it. When I'm good or especially manic, I feel like a rock star. I'll walk around in public dressed crazy just bumping my headphones. Because I don't care. It took me a while but I accepted I am not normal and I'm glad that I'm not. I accept that there will be times where I don't leave my room or shower for a week. I accept this. I don't like it all or the time but hey, no one else cares. And fuck what they think. Do you and that's it. 


We're all different. But this is a small summary of what I went through and how it helped me realize a lot. Hope this helps at least one person."

For players, Lenny Bias is the single greatest ""what if"" for me. 


**Benji**.....same thing man. He went to Simeon which is a  rival high school of mine. Dude was great but Chicago is fucked up and unfortunately he wasn't one of the lucky ones


**Survive And Advance** is fucking amazing and Jimmy V is national treasure. That entire thing is one long feel good story until Jimmy passes away. 


**Once Brothers**....the younger people here might not know who Drazen Petrovic is, but he could have been a revolutionary player. His short time in the NBA showed not just his incredible talent, but also just how much he loved to play as well. And watching Vlade was heartbreaking

It was pretty well known that Chris was one of Chester's heroes.

Neither was starting to speak out any more than they had previously in their life. 


>They both suddenly died very close together time-wise

If you consider one year close together then sure...

Also Chester killed himself on the one year anniversary of Chris's death because he took his death so hard. 

I'm all for guys like Epstein and others and the conspiracy but to minimize the suicide of two musicians while trying to change the details of their lives and deaths to fit some mold is not only insensitive, it's also irresponsible. Not to mention the fact that you clearly don't know the first thing about either of them. Both fought depression all of their lives which is evident in their more than three decades worth of songs, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you can't name five songs by them. Hell, I'd be surprised if you could name the two bands Chris fronted, without looking it up. So I'm sorry but I highly doubt these two fit the mold of the others you're referring to. 


Also, Corey Taylor of Slipknot was molested as a child as well and talks openly about it, much more so than Chester or Chris ever did. And last I checked Slipknot recently released a new album full of bangers with Corey at the helm."

It's the worst withdrawal on earth. 

Lyrica that's a pretty high amount but same deal as before. Gabapentin wreaks havoc on your body even going one day without it. I'll binge lyrica for a week then go three weeks and do it again. It's less calming but more recreational since it hits right away. Add clonazepam with either and it's more fun. I'd recommend cycling one day gaba, next lyrica, next kpin, etc. Once you're routinely mixing them all then it's fuck my life.
