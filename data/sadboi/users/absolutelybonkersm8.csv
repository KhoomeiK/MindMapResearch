CallMeCarson,fmfgp3g,t1_fmeojzk,1586026871.0,"Spamming memes and hateful messages on their subreddit, youtube, twitter, ect isn't criticizing someone for what they did, though... And that's what a lot of people are doing, and saying that it's criticism when it's more like needless hate (especially bc Carson said not to).

It's perfectly ok to say ""I think what Kate and Fitz did is awful and I'm unsubscribing and unfollowing"". In fact, that's what I did too... But understand that much of these people \*are\* witch hunting. They spammed Keem's mentions to report on Carson because they wanted to have a public shaming of Fitz and Kate (and probably get Keem's audience to harass them as well). They spam and brigade both subreddits and then whine about ""censorship"", then spread the toxicity to other subs."

1) Harassment/brigading in other subreddits is against Reddit policy, and I feel like hounding subreddits of popular channels would constitute these.
