AskReddit,fpuj4t1,t3_gffps6,1588914256.0,"My SO and I play PokÃ©mon Go together almost daily. Winter gets pretty unbearable here so we like to go to a nearby park with a figure 8 loop and a 10 mph limit. We usually just do a lap or two unless it's an event day, and on one such event day we were one of many cars repeating the figure 8 to catch 'mons, battle gyms, swipe stops, etc. We always park when raiding or battling, and on one stop to battle a man in a truck pulled up and knocked on my window. I cracked the window because I'm not rude but he's a stranger. He then proceeds to ask us weird questions about why we are at the park. When I, in my eevee hat and eeveelution shirt, show him I've got the game up on my phone and explain we are playing, he laughs nervously like he doesn't believe me.

He then has the nerve to say with an accusatory tone that he was worried about a slow driving car passing his family's pavilion, especially since we didn't appear to have children in the car and we weren't ever getting out. He continued and all but outright accused us of either being kidnappers or pedophiles. I. Was. Livid. I was just out enjoying the park as best I could without freezing my Southern ass off. My husband and small dog were in the car with me. Lots of our local PGO community members were there doing the same thing and he didn't approach any of them. He just drove across the park to confront us specifically. I wasn't driving a van with tinted windows, just my little crossover that was 3 years old and just detailed. I'm a 5'5"" buck forty little blonde who looks too young to buy beer. Wtf did we do to bring this about? We said goodbye and rolled the window up and left stewing on all the rude things we wanted to say to him, you know, the stupid insults you sling to be petty that don't help your case in this sort of situation. Its been months and it still makes me mad thinking about it."

TwoXChromosomes,fmci3hf,t3_fu9y3a,1585946093.0,"3 weeks ago when reported cases had started spreading throughout the USA I went to a regularly scheduled doctor's appointment for a check-in on my recently changed medication. It was a 6:40am appointment at a small clinic, and I was one of maybe 3 patients in the whole building at the time, and the only one in the section for the general practitioner. Because healthcare professionals were already taking it seriously, they were being cautious for the sake of their patients, families, etc and I had to wash up, gloves and mask on as well as scrubs over exposed skin (not much, it was snowing that morning) as did all other patients that morning, then on my way out, another de-scrub and washup and put the mask and gloves I used in a special bin, and they escorted me to make sure I didn't touch things unnecessarily. Lots and lots of elderly patients at that practice and they were just being safe.  


It all took a bit longer than my usual appointment so I let work know that they put in all these processes since they started being a testing center for COVID-19 the day before, and that I'd be a bit late. My boss called me and asked me to provide details of how my visit went (which is 100% not a conversation topic for anyone, thanks HIPPA for having my back) and said not to come in. As an administrative professional most of my duties I can do remotely, but a select few have to be done in person (manage reception, shipping and receiving, opening and closing the office, doling out gift cards for birthdays, etc). This is only at most 15% of my day, usually a lot less, and at the end of the week since my company doesn't have a good task tracking system, I was told that I'd only be paid half salary for my time out and that it would come out of my vacation days. This along with the news that my husband, who also worked at the same office, was being laid off. He was the only ""non-essential"" employee and they were losing clients due to the epidemic and couldn't afford the cost. Yet, daily that week and the following week, I was asked to check in and report every piece of work I did and all of my symptoms, which I did develop mild symptoms. It's been 19 days, and they're finally shutting down the office and having who can work from home because half the employees are high-risk, including the president and the head of payroll.   


My boss asked me how I thought I'd contracted the virus, and I let her know straight up that her sending me on errands the Friday previous to every retailer who maybe had hand sanitizer and kleenex still is probably what did it, since I was exposed to hundreds more people in close-quarters due to the errand, and I started showing symptoms almost exactly 5 days after that, too early most likely to have contracted it at the clinic.  


I'm grateful I still have a job, but man do I want to just smack people who haven't been taking this seriously enough. But wearing gloves. Preferably with a 6ft stick of some kind."

AskReddit,fioyisw,t3_f8tpht,1582593976.0,"I used to work at a poorly managed Call Center when I was in college. One of my best friends from back home lived in my apartment building and our roommates all treated each of us like we lived at one another's places, super chill about going in and out and such. I made food for them and they didnt mind that I'd come over and game past midnight, lots of good times.

April fools day comes around and I'm almost ready to graduate, so I'll be moving out of the apartments soon and I want to pull a mostly harmless prank that his roommates wont hate me for but something that will be memorable. Everyone else was pulling the air freshener grenades, gross things in the vents, icy hot on the toilet seat, swapping non food products with food and the reverse. That all seemed too mean. So I got creative.

At work, for a whole week, I looked for and printed ""Soon"" memes. They were relatively new then and we always used them in our texts with one another. At the end of the week I had close to 100, all 8.5x11, full color, and I affixed glue dots to the backs of each one for hanging. One or two I even laminated first.

March 31st rolls up and my friend is working late, so I ask his roommates who are home if I could come in and pull a totally harmless April fools prank. They are all for it and let me in, then watch me zoom around his room and all the shared spaces in the apartment placing these signs. One inside the cupboard where he keeps his food. A laminated one in the shower up by the head. Another laminated one inside the toilet tank. Another one inside the door of the dishwasher. And the freezer. And the crisping drawer. Some in the utility closet. Some out in the open. Some in the windows. On the back of the couch. In the seem of the recliner where it only showed once you fully reclined. One under his xbox. One between his box spring and mattress. Some behind his already hanging posters. In his dresser drawers. Hanging in his church clothes. One inside his moto helmet. In the bottom of his hamper. Behind his desk. In his pillow case. Just freaking everywhere I could think to put them.

When he moved out 2 1/2 years later, he started snapchatting shots of the final ones he found as he packed. That whole time, he'd find another one every 2 months or so and text me about it.

100% harmless and long lasting. Also those memes are kind of scary to see sometimes if you dont expect them. Now he's getting married in April and I'm thinking I'll have to hide them in his new place while they honeymoon and i feed their kitten."

depression,fikv2hh,t3_f8cd6i,1582487849.0,"I had a friend growing up that was a concert pianist and excellent drummer. We lived in the symticks and always got into trouble out of boredom, but one day the summer after I graduated high school I learned that while building amateur explosives to mess around with on his land, one went off in his palm and he lost (I think 2 maybe but) a finger.

It was tragic to hear about because i knew it would effect his schooling and career dramatically. It's been about ten years and now he's married with his first kid, a lovely wife and he still plays the drums and piano, just had to learn a new way to do it.

It was hard to swallow for a while for him, and he will to this day tell you it's one of the dumbest things he's ever done, but he has a happy, fulfilling life and career. He was still able to do everything he wanted, it just took a bit longer on some things.

I understand that one or two is different from all fingers, but if you keep up physical therapy and find fulfilling ways to spend your time, you can still live just as normal a life as anyone else, and if you can overcome your depression for bursts of time, even a better life than many people.

I hope you recover in every way, that you feel like a whole person for the rest of your life, and that you find work that makes you happy and proud of what you have to offer."

Fast forward to post college, now I'm in Utah and I can't find ONE shop that will give me honest quotes. Every Jiffy Lube tries to sell me an air filter, a flush and full synthetic. Smaller chains or standalone shops try to tell me the newest parts I just installed are worn and need to be replaced, sometimes refusing to do the work I'd come in and asked for if I am not willing to ""make my car safe to drive.""

Best advice I can give, sit in the waiting room after asking them to do what you came in for, and before agreeing to additional services or parts, search for the part cost or a YouTube tutorial on how to do what they're suggesting. Anything with a shorter tutorial than 15 minutes you should not be paying more than ~$40 for, and if the part only cost 12, dont let them charge you triple that to replace it.

Easy car maintenance youtube can show almost anyone how to do:
Using a jack
Filling tires
Checking air pressure
Checking motor oil
Checking transmission fluid
Checking power steering fluid
Checking coolant
Checking washer fluid
Checking brake fluid
Checking brake pad wear
Checking tires for misalignment or balding
Installing accessories like dash cameras, backup cameras, electronic rearview mirrors, bluetooth adapters, radar detectors etc
Using an error code reader to diagnose car issue
Cleaning your engine
Changing bulbs and fuses
Jumpstarting your battery

And so much more. The tools required to do ALL of the above cost under 100 USD total, the basics are a ratchet that fits most bolts on your car, gauges, funnel, gloves, car jack, jumper cables, a flathead screwdriver and a flashlight."

On a side note, the founder of the company I work for makes 8 figures and would have LOVED the gifts pictured in this post. He eats McDonald's 3 times a week, think R&M are hilarious commentary on the current state of humanity, and would build the Lego set with his grandson."

depression,f9l6qlw,t3_e5louu,1575415764.0,"It wont solve everything, but volunteering might help out a lot. You get to be yourself and help people by performing a clear task, and other volunteers will get to know you over time. If you try a lot of different opportunities you will meet a lot of different people. If you regularly support one project, you'll get to know the people there in time.

You are allowed to be loved even without great social skills. Honesty is what is most important. If you get to know someone a little and like them but are having trouble making progress, tell them exactly what's going on. ""I'm not good at socializing but I'm interested in you and want to make sure you know that."" ""I really enjoy spending time with you but I'm not very conversational, I'm worried that could be an issue."" ""I wish I were clever or had interesting things to talk to you about, I want to be interesting to you.""

You will want to be yourself and not act like someone else when you spend all your time with someone. Pretending to be someone you aren't is very tiring, and eventually the facade ends and there goes the relationship. Everyone comes with a little baggage, and someone ready for a mature relationship will know that and be willing to work through it for a chance at happiness."

I'd also like to add that it shouldn't take a crapload of effort and investment to change your style up. Wear things that make you feel powerful. Get a haircut that is low maintenance and accentuates parts of your face and shoulders you want to highlight. Work on your posture and do things for yourself that you enjoy. I never feel sexier than when I am excited to get to do something I want to do."

tifu,f8kdl3g,t1_f8k91v9,1574610081.0,"Same. The causes have ranged from not being fully awake and my shin catching the corner of something, to knicking my leg shaving in the shower and not stopping the bleeding.

Telling people about it terrifies them. I always worry that it will happen somewhere like the office and cause a big scene. Seizing really is the kicker, freaked my SO out the one time he witnessed it.

*edit, SO is not Jesus. I think."
