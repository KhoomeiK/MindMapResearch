I‚Äôm just curious where you are trying to go with this? I just washed my dog. It‚Äôs hard and it sucks. She‚Äôs confused and I‚Äôm without the tasks I need. I found some happiness in how this has impact our other dog, who is excelling in service dog training, regardless of if he completes it. Not like I can find a new one right now with everything going on.



Overall, I get advocating for what you think is best - and I myself would steer people away from selecting a shelter dog as a ‚Äúcheap way to get a first service dog‚Äù - but would push you to not ‚Äúactively advocating‚Äù against shelter dogs. If you know what you are doing and looking for, you‚Äôre not going to experience a huge wash rate (5 service dogs, all shelter, first wash due to training issues). I sure as heck can‚Äôt afford the organization prices, and the 5-7k for professional training has been much more affordable. I find the $1000-2000 for a pure breed unnecessary - if I can spot what makes a pure breed puppy a good service dog candidate, I can spot the same thing in a shelter dog. 

And ... what? Pediatric altering is only recently being addressed, and many organizations still perform altering before 1 year of age, so there is no difference between their likelihood of issues and shelter dogs.

 And poor health of shelter dogs? Also have no idea where that comment is coming from. My first SD was a golden from an organization. Guess what happened? Bad Hips and retired at 5. I‚Äôve had excellent health in my shelter mutts. 

Mutts make good dogs. Reputable breeds make good dogs. But pure breeds come with issues (hopefully corrected by responsible breeding, but I‚Äôve still found shelter dogs healthier than the pure bred dogs I‚Äôve had.)

Long story short: I think you have very negative view of shelter dogs that is not necessary founded in real information. Definitely point out the issues and concerns that come shelter dog to service training, but the alternatives have just as many issues. I think ‚Äúactively advocating against‚Äù is just harmful, and not supportive of the variety of ways disability present, and how we address them that is best for ourselves."
servicedogs,foqvl1v,t1_foqu9m5,1588001602.0,"Yeah. I get the confidence boosting limitation and that aggressive reactions can never be trusted to be gone - I‚Äôve been training my own service dogs for 10 years.  ultimately that was the reason I washed my last one. She was fine 99% of the time, but that 1% is not okay.

we‚Äôre proceeding cautiously, and have not seen a lot a reverting. 
With him, aggression is tensing up and sometimes a low growl, so very much on the low spectrum of aggressive behavior. For example, he was scared of any flooring that wasnt carpet and didn‚Äôt know how to go up and down stairs. His last Owner tried to fix it but grabbing In around the torso and pushing/pulling him into the action. He would tense up, raise heckles, and growl, but nothing more (obviously we dont do this to him)

I deeply believe in shelter to service programs - I have had amazing dogs who had to overcome slight reactivity or confidence boosting - so I would encourage you to not rule them out, but you also need to be okay with more washes and a little more work/attention in the day to day. My disabilities are not to the point where I can‚Äôt give that, so it works for me"

I also don‚Äôt mean this harshly, but it sounds like this dog may be a wash.

Very few dogs are cut out for service. There are more and more people trying to turn their dog into service dogs; which is not a problem! If you need a service dog, our course you would look at your best friend who probably already helps you in some way.... but that doesn‚Äôt mean they can actually make it through.

If he‚Äôs experiencing that much fear, unless you can do some serious confidence boosting (probably with a trainer) you shouldn‚Äôt put him or you at risk. It will hurt you both more than help."

Floor drain as a pea trap. Sink drain isn‚Äôt vented up which is annoying but it does have a pop up valves, so there should be no risk of sewage smell. 

Not sure what you mean by marginal tile work. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a pro, but the grout spacing is even, tiles are level across the room. Fucked up the drain area, but planning to fix that. Do you just not like the pattern?"

ptsd,fh4oeph,t3_f18z9g,1581280621.0,"I work in the counseling field. It‚Äôs less a push away from using the term victim, and more about NOT assuming someone is a victim. When I work with sexual assault victims/survivors, we let them self identify. Some call themselves victims, because, like you said, they were victimized. Some call themselves survivors, because they are taking back power from the person who victimized them.   So there is a push not to say victim, but more because want to offer the person the option to self identify.

Edit to correct her to them, because men will also experience sexual trauma"

The idea that suicide is planned is damaging in so many ways that you can‚Äôt understand unless you work in the field, and it‚Äôs a myth that needs to be stopped.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so they can think about it‚Äù is part of the myth. People rarely welcome the suicidal thoughts. They fight them. They are overwhelmed by them. They drown in them. And then they act. They don‚Äôt think about the decision and then plan it out - when they do, they more often get help then attempt. Suicide in not a rational decision. It‚Äôs a decision of desperation. When you have extended time to think, you can come back to reason and seek help.

Yes, people may state they have a date in mind, though it is rare, but when you look at actual attempts, overwhelmingly, it is decided within a few hours.

You stating that attempting is a well thought out planned decision is unfounded and damaging. Please stop putting that into the world."

AskReddit,fghho3e,t3_eyj1gq,1580785040.0,"I went to a community clinic so the cost was subsidized through the government because I was low income but it was like $300-$450, not including getting the prescription. I had basically a really bad case of strep that I had let go untreated for too long (because I‚Äôm uninsured). I had to go to the clinic because 1) supposedly step won‚Äôt go away without meds 2) I would be fired from my job for calling off over 2 days in a row without a doctors note. So basically I had to give up a weeks worth of pay to avoid being fired and losing multiple weeks of pay.

Also, the prescription was $250, but, I kid you not, the poor pharmacist felt so bad he clued me in that I could sign up for a free prescription rewards card online and it would bring the cost down to $50. 

$200 saved for simply giving up my email. Big pharma and their quest for market knowledge to manipulate the whole system.


Oh yeah. I‚Äôm a student trying to get through college. Obamacare increase the covered by parents age to 26 so you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about healthcare while going through school. I had to save up and wait until I was 23 before I could afford to go to school part time, sometimes full time. But I would have to take breaks to work to pay for college, so would fall off the schools insurance plan. 

So by being poor, I missed my opportunity to go to school at the traditional age and therefore made myself vulnerable to being uninsured while a full/part time student.

TLDR: a lot."
