opiates,fqhhvqb,t1_fqherz9,1589377323.0,"Thanks!   I HOPE it would.  I just have such a high tolerance man and I’m horrified of going trough with it only to wake up after 2 days.  I have one attempt under my belt about 6 years ago.  I had just got out of prison and my ex wouldn’t let me see my son.  I wasn’t on methadone then, I had been locked up for 10 months but was on 60mg before going down.  Even after 10 months in jail I had a tolerance.  I took 30 2mg klonopin and 60 10mg hydrocodone.  Man that felt GREAT for the 45 minutes I was awake before I passed out.  I woke up 2 days later and instead of killing me it just put me in a black out.  I had used the bathroom, the shower was running, the refrigerator was open, 2 gas burners on the stover were on, the front door was wide open, there was half cooked food everywhere.  My wallet was on the porch money laying around.  An empty pizza box on the couch upside down with a receipt from the day before and my laptop was on and I saw where I had made an order on papa Johns pizza.  My CC was already on my profile so it was just a matter of hitting reorder.  I was missing 30 bucks and I’m guessing that’s the tip I gave the delivery guy lol.  I wonder what he thought?   Jesus I’m doomed"
opiates,fqhgarx,t3_gixp14,1589376380.0,"Work, investments, etc.  I’m a depressed opiate addict who goes to work lol.  I’m a welding inspector with a degree in metallurgy and I buy and sell silver and gold on the side and have a few other tricks up my sleeve.  I’ve got about 15 years and I can retire and taken all together investments/property/precious metals and cash I should have close to 3/4 on a million by then.  Of course the kids will have to liquidate a lot of those assists unless they choose to hold onto them.  I’ve spent a lot of time planning this for many years.  I’ve never been a happy person except when I have my sons with me but I’m going through a divorce and my ex is so angry that I chose to divorce her that she is doing whatever she can to make it a miserable process.  People are so fucking fake man. All those years I gave her and I finally got to the point I couldn’t take her angry hateful pouty ways anymore and decided it was time to split up and wanted to do it in a kind decent manner but she wants to punish me for it.  Our oldest son is of age but we have a little boy.  So my kids deserve to have an inheritance which is why I’m going to have to drag myself through the next 15 or 20 years.  Fuck"
opiates,fqhdr7f,t1_fqhcayr,1589374793.0,"Another idea I have is to create a “suicide pill” for emergencies that I could bite down on like the cyanide capsule Herman Goering killed himself with after WWII.  I doubt I can get any cyanide but I could easily get a gram of carfentanyl, pack it into a waterproof capsule and carry it with me, maybe even in my mouth.  That way if the need arises just crunch it up, swallow and if 1000mg of carfentantyl doesn’t do it I don’t know what will.  I think a lethal dose for an average opiate naive person is 4mg.  I was given a 75mcg fentanyl patch a few years ago and I cut it into 4 pieces.  I put a quarter under my tongue and it actually overcame the methadone and I nodded a little.  Strong stuff.  So I geuss ive answered my own question but I still am concerned that 1000mg of methadone might not be lethal."
opiates,fqhcy8c,t1_fqhcayr,1589374274.0,"I know and this terrifies me.  Even overdose death isn’t without pain.  I’m trying to figure out the right type/amount of drug to take to render one completely unconcious so you don’t feel yourself suffocating when respiration ceases.  I geuss what’s so appealing about this is the thought that I have control over my death rather than some random accident or illnesses.  Probably I will wait until I am diagnosed with cancer, it runs heavy in my family."
opiates,fqhcmr0,t3_gixp14,1589374060.0,"Just for fun what would be a fantastic place to do this at?   Maybe on a sunny day laying on a towel in Central Park?   Or in a Brazilian rainforest?   Sitting on a hotel balcony in Cairo that overlooks the great pyramids of giza?   Inside an ancient temple complex like Angor Wat in Campuchia?   At the base of Mt, Everest, opium pipe in hand puffing away until you nod off for the last time?   Any ideas?   Can anyone see why this type of death sounds so appealing to me?   No suffering or pain.  No laying there crying in misery waiting for a 19 year old nursing student with a stick up his ass and a shitty attitude to come along and change your diaper and then waiting for a morbidly obese RN to answer your call light to give you a shot of dilaudid that you’ve been waiting for for an hour feeling the cancer eat you up from the inside.  And have you ever looked at the aftermath of a fatal car accident?   Imagine cruising along at 50mph and a drunk Runs a light going 70, hits you sending your car flying into a telephone pole that slams into the drivers side through the door into YOU crushing every bone on your left side and you are sitting there completely smashed barely breathing in agonizing pain only to die on a stretcher on the way to the hospital covered in blood, cerebral spinal fluid, vomit and to top it all off your boxers or panties are filled with shit and piss.  I wish I was dead"
opiates,fqhb2zz,t1_fqhakgz,1589372983.0,Lol yeah after reading back what I wrote I geuss this is kind of overkill.  I’m just horrified of taking all that and then waking up 3 days later and wanted to get peoples opinions.
coins,fqhaw3b,t1_fpcevvx,1589372842.0,"I’ve come to realize this lol.  Still, I plan to open one every week for the rest of my life or until I get tired of it lol.  I can get proof Ike’s for around 12 bucks from my LCS if I buy ten at a time. Eisenhower’s don’t seem to be popular amongst collectors so they are super easy to get and I love the big ole cartwheels.  And who knows?  Someday they may jump in popularity and I will be sitting on a gold mine.  If coin dealers keep sending unsold silver to the refinery eventually there is going to be a shortage of 90% silver and Ikes"
coins,fqhahz2,t1_fpch7g8,1589372557.0,Yeah I would half to agree with you after thinking about it.  I have opened 5 proofs so far and prob the highest grade I think I would get is proof67.  And the uncirculated ones?   Forget it.  Even though they have been in plastic since 1975 they can still get banged up
SuicideWatch,fqha34i,t3_gins3m,1589372256.0,"First I’m so sorry you are so sad you express so well what I feel.  But Omg I know right?  I plan to die by suicide someday and one of the things that keeps me from doing so is the thought of my family having a funeral for me and all the hypocrisy that goes with funerals, all those people who barely know you and could give a shit less about you standing around shaking their heads and gossipping.  Makes me want to vomit.  My father died by accidental gunshot (translation; he was a dumb ass and was drunk playing with a loaded gun.  I was 12 years old and I’ve never gotten over it.  Thanks a lot daddy) and I remember all those distant relatives at the wake fucking LAUGHING and cramming food in their fucking faces and catching up on old times and I’m sitting their watching this with tears pouring down my checks and I wanted to shoot those motherfuckers.  So yeah, where is all the compassion when your still alive?   People are fake af and when I go I’m making sure I’m making damn sure that I get cremated and my ashes thrown in the woods and nobody outside of my immediate family is told otherwise any assets I leave goes to charity.  I’m actually thinking of having a lawyer write up a will that specifies this.  No funeral no wake no second cousin standing their going tsk tsk tsk what a shame."
coins,fpcekee,t3_gcnmga,1588497603.0,"So far no luck.  One has a tiny rim ding, one is yellow from pvc and the proof has a teeny tiny so small you can only see it with a scope blob of stickiness.  Plastic most likely.  Shit.  Lol.  I got 3 uncirculated and 2 proof sets for $80.  LCS did me right that day.  Oh and 2 1972-S solo for 16 bucks"
coins,fomzyhb,t3_g819vp,1587908761.0,After reading further that’s crazy that they almost melted it down.  I know dealers frequently do this and they justify it by saying shit like oh well nobody likes Washington quarters/Roosevelt dimes/low grade Mercury’s/Arabian gold pieces/etc so I have to take them to the scrap yard to get my money out of them. BULL I say.  They just don’t want to sell low grade or coins that not many people collect at a low price for fear that it makes it harder for them to move better pieces at higher prices.  I would be more than happy to buy up a pound or two of well worn quarters and Kennedy’s for spot plus a little percentage but as soon as you say that they want spot plus 20% or more or off to the smelter they go.  The part that pisses me off is that I understand they have to make a Living so don’t fault them to much for being stingy when it comes to constitutes silver and such but I wonder how often pieces like this 4 pound end up getting melted simply because they don’t take the time to find a buyer?   How much history do they throw away every year?   That bugs me.  Granted this isn’t every LCS I have a local guy who is awesome and once he found out I was interested in unusual stuff like Arabian rials and Greek drachma  he started saving them when he came across them and gives me a good price.  Another dude I quit doing business with because he had a whole pile of Maria Theresa thalers in his junk bin and I bought every one of them and he flat out told me that if he comes across any more he would be glad to save them for me but to expect to pay a lot more than I paid for the “junk” ones that day simply becaue he figures if I’m that interested in them he can take advantage. Sounds like your LCS is one of the good ones and I’m happy for you!  Damn I want one now lol
coins,fom9xx8,t3_g819vp,1587882761.0,"NICE!!   I have a small collection of Arabian  coins, all silver, and this would go perfect with them.  Jealous lol.  I’ve looked at these online but never seen on in the wild."

coins,fnv42xv,t3_g1jne1,1587279560.0,Wait until all this coronavirus mania dies down and the coin shops open back up and you can get $1.00 face value in silver for around 13-20 bucks depending on the current spot price of silver.  Any old US silver is at a premium right now though from paranoid hoarding
todayilearned,fnnxm0e,t1_fnn0smn,1587104927.0,"I do aswell.  A cool aside is that when I take hallucinogenic drugs like lsd I hear death metal music playing when I run water into the bathtub.  Vocals, guitar chords, demon like screams and drums.  If I turn the water off wait a moment then turn it back on at a different flow it’s a different song.  Never the same twice.  lol and yes it’s actually really fucking cool.  The first time it happened i was in LSD on top of using some snorted methamphetamine.  I at first thought it was coming from the bedroom but when I went to check but it was dead quiet in the rest of the house but I could still hear it coming from the bathroom.  I told my wife , who was high AF that there were demons in the plumbing I can HEAR THEM MAN They are playing death metal and your bathe is almost ready my love and danced off to the bathroom chanting HaIl Satan! And laughing.  She wouldn’t take a bathe with me"
coins,fng6yit,t3_g1jne1,1586923832.0,I love that chaging sound silver makes when it’s dropped.  That’s how I usually spot old quarters and such that occasionally turn up in change.  Not too long ago I got a brit silver 3p from 1916 in my change in Liu of a dime

I could see this happening in the past and being offered to uninformed customers as gold, although the weight alone gives it away so I’m going with a modern job.  A damn nice one at that.  I’m opposed to most cleaning/plating of coins but considering a million of these on average are minted every year it’s not as if an ultra valuable coin has been defaced.  I have about 20 MT thalers half being modern restrike a and the rest possibly late 19th to early 20th century strikes"

coins,fn7w4pl,t1_fn5vtbk,1586728828.0,"God tell me about it.  I started dealing after I lost my career b/c if felony possesssion conviction. Nothing but just enough to support my habit and make up for the lost wages but I did hit some licks and I wish I had gone out and spent it on junk silver and gold instead of call girls and partying lol.  That’s the downside of dealing drugs, one major one at least, is that in order to make any money doubt it you have to get to know the people who would like what you are selling.  It’s not like you can go to a coin convention and just say to a dealer “oh btw I’ve got some ice that’s got hella legs and some 3mg pressed bars for trade if your interested” lol.  I started out by swapping numbers with people I met at the pill mill clinics and after going down I met up with a few people who I met in prison or county and it snow balled from there.  People need to realize that if you send a non violent offender to prison more than likely all they will do is learn more crime.  I did out of despair with a if you can’t beat em join em attitude.  It took several years for me to tire of the lfestly and say enough and slowly crawl out.  It can be done.  Don’t get discouraged.  Work work work.  Get some student loans or grants. I got a grant that enabled me to pay for everything except books and by smart shopping I’ve been able to find what I need for around 20% of cover price.  When I have extra cash I spend it on my family and when I save I put half in the bank and half in silver coins.  Hopefully I never have to resort to cashing them in but if I had to I could sell off all my silver and gold for right at spot and walk off with enogh to live on for 6 months.  My plan is that once I finish school and can save twice as much in cash as I do now I will still keep investing a small portion in my collection but no longer with the idea that it could act as emergeny money.  I’m broke half the time and just barely making it with this pandemic but man it feels good to be an honest law abiding dude again tbh.  I am on methadone for the opiate addiction and it’s just like my blood pressure pill I take it and forget about it once a day.  I have a script for temazepam for use once or twice a week for the bad nights.  Family trusts me with keys and wallet lol.  I’ve had to interact with P.D. Twice since going straight and instead of sweating bullets and panicking I just calmly mention I have a couple of drug convictions at the outset and both times they say well you seem to be good now.  Once I had just left a local coin shop and had 8 or 10 peace dollars, a whole roll of 40% silver Kennedy’s and some other stuff sitting in a lock box and the cop asked what I had and I opened it and showed him the receipt and he was like yeah your good now.  A tweaker would never go out and buy coins lol. Turned on he had several 1970 JFK halves and diddnt even know they were silver.  So my traffic stop ended up being a fun talk about numismatics.

Hopefully your an average Joe who couldn’t pass up the opportunity and that’s what I suspect.  Or your a pawn broker and.....I live in a huge city and come across all walks of life and a few times I’ve gotten calls or been approached by someone and they know that I know that they diddnt find/inherit/but whatever it is they are offering (the most memeorial time was a guy offering 5 MS restrike 1770 MT Thalers with the story that his grand great something brought them from Nazi Germany before the war and they had been in the family for hundreds of years etc.  I told him I would give him 100 bucks which is a bit more than they were worth and then showed him on eBay when he pressed for more.  He then accepted.) and the few times I’ve accepted it’s been because i tell them just once will I do this so DONT call me with this story again.  I figure it’s better than them going to a pawnshop and getting 5% of the real value and then breaking into a bunch of other homes.  I don’t blame you tho OP I couldn’t have passed that up but I would have given them my usual sermon about only once and probably sold a few and given them a bit more but that’s me and I’m not judging
