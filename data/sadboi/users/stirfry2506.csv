Turns out she couldn't due to various reasons and I had to buy it locally. Me and mom were arguing why its better to buy it there and ship it here. 5 minutes later, I was playing a game and I clicked an ad to get more prize money. Guess what the ad was - buy anything in the US with an US address and ship it to my country at a low cost! That's when I realised electronics listen to everything."

In fact I was fapping at the stroke of midnight on my 18th birthday and nobody texted me. 22 right now and all I learnt is this - Don't depend on others for what you want. If you want something, you gotta go get it. Took me 3 years to understand that. Still struggling with an examination for the past 4 years and couldn't pass. But it's when you fall you'll know how to get uo. You have a bright future ahead of you."

One evening, I was returning from class to my home and the bus was crowded. I've done this many times and this day was no different. The design of the bus was so poor that the front axle was extremely close to the front footboard. As I was about to board the running bus, I had found a place to keep my one foot in the bus and the other foot came dangerously close to the front axle. From that day on, I swore never to travel on footboard of a crowded bus and to this day have maintained that vow."
