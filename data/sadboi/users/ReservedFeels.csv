CancerCaregivers,fhy65nk,t3_f50yf5,1581969393.0,"Well THIS is hitting a little too close to the heart for me. Back in August my mom was having stroke like symptoms. Beginning of November, gliobastoma. End of November, surgery. Beginning of January, chemo/radiation for 6 weeks. Everything ended today. She's in awesome shape. She shaved her hair off because of the radiation and has only felt the fatigue in the last week or so. As neurotic as I am, I'm taking this as a win, but everyone knows it'll get worse soon... I can see the door from here and I'm holding the key."
gadgets,fhi00f0,t3_f3cj17,1581615119.0,I am currently dealing with a stalker. I'd use the lock for my front door. Motion/Contact sensor for my patio door. Bulbs to schedule so it looks like I'm at home when I'm not. The camera (I already have 4) would be put in my basement bedroom facing out if they decide to knock on my bedroom window for the 3rd time. SD card to put into the camera and be able to record activities and send to the police.

If you don't have an SD card, you won't get the playback feature. If you do have an SD card inserted in your camera, it will have playback, however depending on the size of the card it does overwrite past feeds to include the newest video. All \*events\* are kept in the cloud for 14 days.

Hope this helps, if not let me know and I'll try to explain it better. I have 4 installed in and around my house. Good luck!"

The affair was found out. He ""separated."" Or so he told me. A few weeks later I find out that the wording he used was giving her (and his family) the hope that the mariage wasn't over. The wife requested he go NC with me. So he did. For a few days. But then kept it from them. Lied about it again when asked. And then got caught again. Cue that one more time. 

&#x200B;

Back in October he did pretty much what  /u/[SD2Vanilla](https://www.reddit.com/user/SD2Vanilla/) did, actually went NC with me, to try to actually fix the marriage. To be able to say that he wasn't in contact with me, and not have to lie about it. Then he went (or so he says) through the same feelings as [SD2Vanilla](https://www.reddit.com/user/SD2Vanilla/), as much as he started the NC with good intentions, he never did really try to salvage the mariage. He was doing it to be able that he tried, but deep down he wasn't able to get me out of his head. He made it a few months and then reached out. As soon as he did he told his wife and his family, which lead to the end of his mariage officially. 

&#x200B;

We've pumped the breaks on our reunion, taking things actually slow, just as 2 individuals would when they first start dating. We want to make the foundation of what we are as strong as possible before starting something long lasting. 

&#x200B;

I realize that I will always have the OW label for his friends, family, and STBX, but I no longer want to have the mistress label with him. And in order to do so, we both have some personal work to do. 

&#x200B;

Sure, ""most of them will never leave,"" but some do. And when they do, there's a high probability that it won't work. But some do last. So it's silver linings and positive thoughts and hard work on both sides that makes the foundation of any relationship. 

&#x200B;

Good luck!"
bipolar,fedg9gm,t1_fecrj46,1579010712.0,"Thank you! We did have a conversation last night. I expressed my feelings and gave him some I formation that I myself have read for my benefit. He asked if he was “allowed” to ask questions, I said “of course, I’d rather that than you make wrong assumptions about me and my disorder.” 

I also did tell him what happens when I forget to take my meds. I’ve never actively gone off of my meds, fully being aware of how I feel when I’m not on them and I don’t want to feel that way. I appreciate your response, it has made me feel a lot better about all of this."
bipolar,fe966q1,t1_fe91z3c,1578934709.0,Recently as in we’re going in full tilt actually “dating” and not off and on with benefits. But also I’m asking myself the same question as to why now.
