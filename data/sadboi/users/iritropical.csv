SCT,flshlsw,t3_fqu839,1585442307.0,"Trust me, I know exactly how you feel! When I attended my first year of university last year, I suffered immensely. I could barely go to class and when I got home, I had to take a nap right away. Even after my nap, I still couldn’t find the motivation to get out of bed and study. So, it resulted in me cramming all night to study all the material on my exam the next morning. I found that the only way for me to study, was to work under pressure. I never understood why I was like this and thought all this time I was slower than other students. I know the pain. I know how stressful it is - because all you wanna do is get your degree and continue the path on your career. But, it feels like all of this is holding you back. 

I highly suggest you go see a psychiatrist who could prescribe you medication. I started taking a stimulant (Vyvanse) + antidepressant (Wellbutrin)  two weeks ago. This helped me gain more energy, feel motivated, find my words more easily, alleviate my depression, and have more control over my train of thought. However, I still noticed I had horrible brain fogs. So, I ordered Sarcosine (which a lot of people said helped with their SCT) and received it three days ago. I’ll just say that this supplement has done wonders for me. I barely have any brain fogs, even more energy, and much less anxiety. On the side of this, I started meditating and took CBT classes. Also, when I start my classes in May, I plan on using accommodations and taking fewer courses so then I get more time to study. 

Not all of my problems have been solved, but almost all of them have at this very moment! You just need to find what works best for you. I know the frustration and that’s why I decided to comment under this. It was just a month ago when I wrote in this group about how stupid I felt compared to everyone. This disorder had completely taken over my life and I became extremely depressed. But, I found ways to manage my symptoms."
BPD,fli8j91,t1_fli5rv0,1585177387.0,"Very relatable! I always thought these things were normal, but it really wasn’t. I remember going through a period in junior high where all I would listen to was Amy Winehouse. Then, all of a sudden I wanted to be like her. I wanted to snort cocaine, be drunk in public, and copy the way she did her eyeliner.  
If your friends understand what your going through, then that’s really good! I feel like my longtime friends suspect something is wrong with me, but don’t want to confront me about it. I’ve made too many horrible decisions that they had to help me through. But, I’m just gonna leave them in the dark about it, because it’s hard explaining this disorder to someone.

Over the last few days, I did do some thinking about the situation and talked to a guy friend about it. He was blunt and honest with me. He told me that there was no doubt that this guy didn’t respect me at all. However, I badly didn’t want this to be true (even though I knew it was), so I kept trying to find ways to justify his actions. I didn’t want it to be true because I was afraid of him leaving me. I was afraid of being overwhelmed with emotions - like shame, embarrassment, sadness, etc. After that, I took it to the heart and made my decision on not talking to him ever again. Now here’s the problem, what if he messages me? Will my emotions over flood me and start talking to him again. This is why I hate borderline aha. 

Just wondering though, are you in cbt or dbt? I’m in cbt and it helped a lot for me. Would recommend you try either or."
BPD,fk8p50j,t3_fh2drc,1583960239.0,"Very quiet.. very reserved.. unless I’m around super close friends. I hate speaking up.. because I’ve always felt like what I’m saying isn’t right. Even when I’m mad at someone and I know what they did was wrong, I don’t trust my word enough to speak up and tell them what they did was wrong. So, a lot of people get mixed signals from me. Like, how was a mad over text? But, not saying a word in person? 
And since I don’t trust myself enough, I’m extremely socially anxious. Like.. should I say this or that? Oh shit, I just missed my opportunity to talk. I can’t walk in public alone. I can’t go clubbing with friends. I can’t even walk into work. I feel like all eyes are on me all the time. 
I even work in customer service. Imagine how it is when customers get mad at me for things and I can’t speak for myself.. they always end up saying “what?” or ask to speak to someone else. 
Then, there are those times where I try to break out of this shell and act extremely loud.. instead, I look stupid, awkward, and abnormal. I could even tell from other people’s faces.. they don’t even know what to say to me. I only do this because I want to feel validated. I want friends. But, I can’t just act like myself ever. My tone changes every time I talk to someone new and it sucks. Everything I do depends on the other person.. I hate my life lol."

But, I take rejection super hard so I don’t want to hear him say it. I just wish I knew I’d feel like this before I got into it cause now I don’t want this to end. Someday, it will have to end.

Yes, the sex was good, but he messages me every now and then and says things like “I randomly had a thought of you” or “I’m never gonna stop chasing you.. just know that” or “you know you have my soul.” But tbh.. that doesn’t take away from him being a jerk.. he’s asked to make plans many times, but as soon as the time comes, he doesn’t say anything. I remember one time he said something that I didn’t understand.. but I took it the wrong way.. and it crushed me deeply. Almost cried. I feel hurt but he keeps feeding into me.

I completely agree with what your therapist is saying. I got to a point where I was smoking three times a day. Then, after a few months, I noticed my heart started racing extremely fast and I felt like I was dying over my thoughts anytime I smoked. Horrible thoughts - literally about how horrible, stupid, and dumb I was. I even remember smoking with friends and having to go to the bathroom to cry and calm down during these moments. Nobody knew what I was going through during these moments. It wasn’t even enjoyable anymore and it became one of the most scariest moments for me because it felt like I was going to die from overthinking. Even worse than the time I actually greened out."

I’m very positive that I have borderline personality disorder (bpd) and have been trying to get a diagnosis. So, I’m actually a little shocked that you did mention it. I feel completely paralyzed by it. I feel like my life depends around everyone and how they view me. I don’t even know who I am as a person anymore. It’s just hard when psychiatrists try helping me by giving me medication, but I refuse to take them because I assume they don’t work and is affecting my brain. I don’t know what to do."

I haven’t been in that situation where I wanted to keep seeing them. But if I were, I think I would fully explain to them the reason behind it. Also,  you yourself need to think about how this will make you feel in the long term. I felt a lot of shame and humiliation for the things I did - even still to this day - and I wouldn’t want to feel that again ever. You need to focus more on getting better for yourself and trust me, it makes you feel more confident as you’ll gain a lot of self-love and respect for yourself!"

It’s self-destructive behaviour and it’s only going to hurt you in the long term. If it helps, probably better to say that you want to only be friends and nothing else before you see each other.

Then, a few days ago I crashed. I completely hated myself in every way possible and the life I was living. It felt like I was doing everything to get away from the fact that I felt empty, hopeless, and was in fact dealing with depression. I stopped all I was doing to get better and spent my time in my room crying. Today, I sort of got back up and am trying again.

I can’t even talk to someone with my mind telling me that the person is talking to me and I can’t read books or watch movies without my mind wandering off thirty seconds into it.

starbucks,f3zmwlf,t3_di8xun,1571272667.0,"Hey, I’m a new partner who started in August and and know exactly how you feel! Like, last week, my coworker was in the middle of making a drink on cold bar and decided to go to the bathroom halfway through making a drink and didn’t tell me. When he came back from the bathroom, he was told to go back on register. Then, the customer went to the manager and asked where her drink was. The manager then came over to me and asked why I was putting stickers on cups and not doing them. Then, I told her that it was coworker who started that drink and he went to the bathroom without coming back to finish it. She then started yelling at me and told me that I should have known it was there and to stop the drinks I was making on hot bar to come finish it. This obviously made no sense because how was I supposed to know that the drink was on cold bar if I was working on hot bar? It’s like I’m always getting blamed for someone else’s mistakes. But, here’s what I’ll say. You need to speak up because they will keep putting blame on you if you don’t. Like, today my coworker took the sign off the brewed coffee and I was automatically blamed by the supervisor for it. I told her that I never did that and she apologized and got upset with the other coworker. Once you start speaking up, then they know that you know exactly what your doing and you’ll start feeling more comfortable in your position. Trust me, everyone has gone through this and my partners always told me that it took them about 6 months to feel completely confident in their position. I’ve gotten customer drinks wrong many times, have had customers get mad at me and talk to the manager, have been screamed at by my coworkers and manager. I was and still am at the point of wanting to quit on my bad days. However, I realized that my partners make the exact same mistakes all the time and they’ve all been working there for years. They spill drinks, they make drinks wrong, they yell at customers - it’s a whole mess. But, it’s human error! And your partners need to be understanding of it. Like, my partner always tells me that you can repeat an order to a customer about 10 ten times and it’s still not right when they get it! There’s nothing you can do and you just have to apologize and get their order right for them. Just try and improve on your skills each time, because trust me, the supervisor will be talking to the manager about how you did that day. I always go home after work and review the drinks to make sure that I know them. Also, compare yourself from now to when you started, have you seen a big improvement? I bet you have. It comes with a lot of practice and even a lot of practice still allows mistakes to happen. Just be patient with yourself and one of my partner tells me that when you go home, forget all the things that happened at work. That helped a lot for a person who suffers from social anxiety, depression and borderline personality disorder."

ADHD,ezc7mje,t3_d0q4b1,1567831073.0,"I don't have a lot of advice because I'm still going through this, but I can tell you that I know exactly how you feel. I recently found out I had ADD and had just completed my first year of university. It hurts knowing that I could have had a better life growing up if I had known about my diagnosis earlier. I felt like I spent most of my life trying to fit in with other individuals and always had a false sense of who I was. Growing up, I always felt lost and clueless in everything I did which allowed others to think of me as being ""slow"" and ""dumb."" I constantly had to ask my other classmates as to what we were supposed to be doing in class, was never able to pay attention to others when they were talking to me, was never able to give good responses to others (since I wasn't paying attention to what they said), was never able to put thoughts into words, etc - all symptoms of ADD. Sometimes, I wish I could just go back into time and change these thoughts that others had of me. I wish they had known that I had more potential and that I was in fact smart. I wish my relationships with others were better - because most of the time I believed it was one-sided and it was always me being sensitive to every small thing which caused a fallout with many people. I've even started blaming myself and others for not realizing these symptoms in me - like my teachers, who called me out for having five missed assignments in class. For me, what helps me the most is to do things that make you feel more confident in yourself. Like, I go to the gym almost everyday and love seeing the results that come with it. I just feel this helps me the most because I felt that ADD had caused a lot of self-esteem issues and I always felt less than other individuals. Also, I found that deleting my social media was helpful because I didn't have to think about the lives that other individuals lived and compare it to mine. Another thing, is to find things that could be therapeutic in dealing with ADD. I've heard of individuals listening to podcasts, downloading apps that focus on breathing, and simple things like writing your schedule down for the day or keeping a journal. I find that writing helps me the best because I can get the feelings that I've been holding in for long out. I just want to let you know that you are not alone and many people feel exactly what your feeling. When your diagnosed, there is both pain and relief. Relief because you have figured out what has been going on and that you can get treated, but also pain because you lived a past life without being diagnosed and need to keep living with the diagnosis. We'll get through this. I promise."
ADHD,ezbm7b5,t3_d0k4za,1567822354.0,"Yes, with inattentive ADHD, it's harder to notice symptoms. I never knew I had ADHD until I was eighteen and finished my first year of university. I always just grew up thinking I was ""slow"" in everything and that's how everyone saw me. Anytime I didn't understand a joke my friends would call me a ""blonde."" I even remember my friend introducing me to her parents as being one. I never understood what the teacher was saying in class and had to ask my other classmates as what we were supposed to do. I never understood what the teacher was saying, was constantly called on in class for not paying attention, and always had missed assignments. I always zoned out when people would talk to me and always had people telling me that I was in my ""own little world."" I always had a hard time putting my thoughts into words or onto paper, was always distracted by my surroundings, and had horrible relationships with everyone. I always felt clueless, lost, and lazy in everything I did. 

Obviously, this took a toll on my self-esteem because I started thinking that people were smarter and better than me, which led to doctors diagnosing me with depression and social anxiety. Then, when I started university, my relationship with my friend group was horrible. I always got upset over small things and felt they saw me as ""dumb."" I felt that I had to prove myself to them all the time and couldn't be myself around them anymore. Then, I would contemplate on ending my friendship with them anytime things got awkward and would isolate myself which made me extremely depressed. I searched this up, coming across RSD and ADHD. When I read different posts on reddit about people having ADHD, I was almost certain I had ADHD. I went to class the next day, sat down, and told myself to try paying attention to the teacher. Then, I realized I couldn't. Everything the teacher said would go through my ear. I was only able to pay attention for the first minute and mind would start wandering. That's how I figured that I for sure had ADHD. 

Honestly, it's the hardest thing to deal with. But with medication, this improves a lot and you feel like you can function normally in society."

ADHD,exwfcaa,t1_exw7sa0,1566618618.0,"I would plan ahead as to what I was going to study each day by writing them down. I always made sure they were reasonable and I had plenty of time to study. I also had ""off-days"" - where I would take a break from studying that day. On the days I had to study, I would go to library in the morning and find a quiet study room for the entire day. I find myself procrastinating more at home and wanting to lie down on my bed and just be on my phone. In my opinion, I find it easier to keep my phone on than to turn it off at the library. It's a distraction, but I find it more of a distraction when I keep feeling the need to turn it on and check it. Also, I often take breaks where I would get up and walk around the library to refresh my mind."
ADHD,exw6vys,t3_cun9wq,1566614130.0,"I just started taking 10 mg of Vynase last week. When I first put the pill into my mouth, I felt the effects within an hour. I had a sudden burst of energy and didn't feel anything like myself. I felt more confident in speaking with others and had little anxiety. However, it's been two days and the effects are dying down. What I felt on the first day is not what I feel today. In fact, I don't feel anything different as to when I was off medication."
ADHD,exvtqdq,t3_cum761,1566606448.0,"I do the same thing too. I'm taking sciences in university and the only way I could remember things is by watching youtube tutorials or writing and drawing notes on the whiteboard. When I come to the exam, I have to remember where I wrote something in my notes to know the answer. 

The same thing in group conversations. For example, if my friend was talking about her boyfriend's friend's mother. My mind starts picturing her boyfriend, then her boyfriend having a friend, and that friend having a mother. 

It's strange and makes things a lot harder since we used words in our everyday lives to get messages across to each other."
TwoXChromosomes,es9y5s8,t3_c6jawg,1561747186.0,"I just want to let you know that many teenage girls have gone through the fear of being pregnant. 

I'm 18, and I remember having a few scares at the age of 16. I was scared to tell my friends and kept it to myself because I was extremely scared. However, one time, my friends and I were all talking about pregnancy and if we have had any scares. Apparently, we all had them before and just didn't tell each other. 

I also know many girls that have became pregnant and had an abortion as a teenager. And honestly, if I got pregnant at 17, I would have an abortion myself because I'm not ready to be dealing with a child. That's a life that your dealing with. Also, my parents are strict as well. I remember my mom telling me about how my niece got pregnant as a teenager and how her parents kicked her out. My mom proceeded to tell me that if I ever got pregnant, ""I would never be allowed to come home again."" I know that isn't true, because my mom wouldn't kick me out on the streets if I had nowhere to go. She just wanted to scare me into not having sex. However, I know she would be extremely upset. I wouldn't even want to live to see my father's reaction. 

Also, you were in a relationship with your boyfriend of two years. Of course, your going to be having sex. I would find it surprising if you weren't honestly. 

And mistakes happen all the time too. You could even get pregnant if the condom broke."
ADHD,ep9trwp,t3_bhhgqm,1559116104.0,My friend said this when I told her about my ADHD diagnosis and how I was going to start taking adderall. She even said she told her mom about it and she's gonna get tested.
