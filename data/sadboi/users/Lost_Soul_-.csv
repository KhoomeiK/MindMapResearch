The way you have been feeling sounds very difficult and I'm sorry you don't have anyone to lean on. It sounds really difficult to deal with. I think that you should call some sort of helpline, before it's too late. They can be someone you can lean on and really help you."
depression,fr49e76,t3_gml9g5,1589880533.0,"Go online and Google a depression test. They are no way a diagnosis but it might give you a pointer on whether it could be depression or not.

depression,fqp90mz,t3_gk6neq,1589539313.0,"I feel very similar and I felt similar when my friends were going through a rough time. It was only when I actually spoke to someone about my friends when I actually got upset. And I had no idea why I was crying and then after, I continued to worry and realise that why I cried was that before it everything felt not real but talking made it real. Idk if that makes sense. So basically maybe try actually speaking to someone about this. Like using your voice, not on message or anything. It might trigger your feelings"
depression,fqhitut,t1_fqh9jx3,1589377865.0,That's really amazing. Like everything you are doing.
depression,fqh9cq4,t3_gixmjs,1589371698.0,"It truly sounds awful what both you and her are going through. There isn't much you can do apart from just remind her that you're there for her. Maybe try distracting yourself, keeping busy, doing art watching tv etc. Focus on yourself because there's nothing that you can do for her rn. Make sure she still has you as a strong mentally healthy friend by the time you get back."
SuicideWatch,fqgvt7j,t3_giv1wz,1589358868.0,Just wait until morning. Or call a helpline. Even if its the last thing you do
depression,fqgtwm3,t3_giunwy,1589356992.0,Idk if this will work for you but everyday look in the mirror and say 3 things you like about yourself. Or just 1 to start off with and then build on it each week. It'll take time but maybe this could help you learn to live yourself more
depression,fqgtcpk,t3_giuihe,1589356470.0,"It's a good thing that you don't want those thoughts however I'm not really sure if you can stop them. Yes some of our problems actually are petty and not as bad as yours but you just have to keep in mind that to them, that's the worst thing for them right now. We all judge people, even when we don't want to. Its automatic. I think you are going in the right direction to tell the thought to go away."
depression,fqgs3lz,t1_fqgrkrc,1589355300.0,"Fair enough with the not talking. That is a good decision. I hate that being mugged is common around you, it must be so scary! Hotline's are amazing. Sometimes you just speak to the wrong person that are on at the time. They do care. When you read a post on this, do you hope that the person didn't end up killing themselves or something? I know that I do. Most the time, these hotline workers are volunteers and they do what they do because they want to help people in any way they can."
depression,fqgqkmq,t3_gitu2o,1589353891.0,"It's good to rant so don't regret it. That girl sounds pretty awful. Maybe try confronting her in the way she made you feel? Maybe she genuinely did think you guys were just having a laugh and it meant nothing or she is just a horrible person. She may not understand that jokes can still hurt. Being mugged is something nobody should say is ""not a big deal"". The police could hopefully help out with that if you wanted to report it. You wouldn't have to do it to get the money back but more to get them arrested so that they stops mugging anyone. Because one day he could end up mugging the wrong person and it could seriously mess that person. With moving away that sounds rough. You'll have to make sure you facetime your sister. Maybe it'll be a good thing for her though too, force her to socialise with more people. I think sometimes parents need to be shown how bad it is. Or told by someone older than you. Maybe try calling up a hotline. They can give you advice. I remember one that asked for my mums number so they could call her up and have a chat. That was good because it explained to her that this was real and not just ""having a bad day"". She was upset at first but she came to her senses and its so much easier to be around her now. Plus if they don't want you seeing anyone, a hotline could be your way of getting help."
SuicideWatch,fqgp101,t3_gitmkk,1589352535.0,"First of all, you need to know that there will be people calling up about less but also that for most of the numbers, you don't need to be in crisis to call them up. As well as telling the person your problems, also tell the person on the hotline about your fears you have about talking. They could help calm those thoughts. Calling the hotline won't make everything stop however they may calm the way you feel. Make them quieter and give you some advice for the future. I think the first time you ever talk to someone about things over the phone or in person, is one of the hardest things to do. But you've just got to go through with it. I remember the first time I called a hotline. I called and put the phone down before anyone answered about 3 times. I told them it was my first time and I was nervous and they were really supportive. I think they could really help you out."

depression,fqdqq5t,t3_gic8x1,1589294924.0,"Don't put a happy face on for others, all that'll leave you is alone. And your far from it. It might bring others down however being alone with your problems is one of the hardest things to carry around. Sometimes you need that other person to help lift that weight. They are telling you their problems so you should tell them yours. It'll make your friendships stronger and might help them feel better because you are telling them the truth and they may feel they can relate to you in some ways plus helping friends does feel good. You must must tell them about how things are going. Carrying those worries alone is dangerous"
depression,fqde2em,t1_fqdcu6v,1589287573.0,"Thank you for your comment, it means a lot however when I think about life, no matter how happy I'll ever be, they will always be something. Happiness always ends with sadness whether that's through death or loosing it. That's the trick when it comes to it, it always ends with pain. It doesn't take a lot to tip me over the edge, and it didn't take a lot to put me into this dark hole. No matter what happens, I'm always going to have regrets and worries and memories. And no matter what happens, it won't take a lot to tip me over again."
depression,fqd868c,t3_gi9bbk,1589282932.0,"Feeling nothing COULD be a sign of depression however this is absolutely no place to get a diagnosis as I highly doubt anybody is a doctor. Maybe talk to your parents about the way you feel, how they only see the bad and your not feeling too good lately but maybe through message if they don't listen to you. Tell them to read it all the way through until the end. It might make them understand easier instead of having to put it into words they may not get or forget. Maybe you could try and get an appointment with a doctor who can diagnose you if you do have depression or some closure if you don't. Just make sure you keep busy and do things that make you feel happy."

SuicideWatch,fqd6ixc,t3_gi8vv6,1589281432.0,"You've got to distract yourself and do something. Whether that's watching tv, playing on the console, painting etc. Something you enjoy.

depression,fqd2phs,t3_gi85cd,1589277665.0,"You might not be ready for help. I know that sometimes when I try to talk about things, my words just stop and I want to speak but I cant.

depression,fqd2m64,t3_gi87w7,1589277569.0,It tends to have a trigger and it's more common amongst people who've been through traumatic events however its not always like that. Loneliness or stress or a lack of enjoyment can cause it and then untreated it can get worse and worse.
SuicideWatch,fqczre6,t3_gi7jbp,1589274600.0,"If you have dreams, keep them in mind. Just slow down and think. Do you really want it all to end? Some people find that they don't really want to die forever, they only want to stop existing for a set amount of time like until they are 18 or until the quarantine is over. Death is permanent though. You can still achieve things like getting a family, even if life is difficult now. In my opinion, I think you should call a helpline or get an appointment with your doctor. What you feel is not pathetic so never think it is. So many people feel similar to you. Just because it's a rough time now doesn't mean it'll be a rough time forever."
SuicideWatch,fqb5s52,t3_ghwdbt,1589231072.0,"This is so so similar to the way I feel. You can't really expect the thoughts to go away on their own. If you have anything like depression, it tends to last for about 6-8 months before naturally leaving but then your at risk of them coming back so go to therapy. They can give you so much more advice"
depression,fq9b3ap,t3_ghkujf,1589192129.0,"You can't think about other people right now. Do you feel bad? Do you need help? Do you want help? If all yes, then call the helpline. There will be people calling up about lesser things. Just focus on you"

depression,fq95ho3,t3_ghjm71,1589186270.0,"I'd suggest writing down your interests and the way you feel when it comes to your mind like if you hear a song on the radio and its pop, right that down, maybe you'll see a pattern. And/Or write your problems and thoughts in a diary or something and then bring it to therapy with you. Then you can either go off of that or give your therapist the diary. That might help you get to know yourself again and make it easier to think rather than having to think on the spot. Also maybe try bringing this up with your therapist - how you feel. She might be able to help you out."
SuicideWatch,fq955xy,t3_ghjm97,1589185927.0,"Slow down. I can imagine you typing this at 100 mph. With therapy, I'd suggest you try again. I get it with the anxiety but you should go a few times, get to know your therapist and then maybe on the 4th week of going you'd actually be able to say something. You don't have to speak about everything all at once. You can take your time. And you don't have to stick with just one therapist. If you decide they aren't your type of person, you can request someone else. Just make sure you say you aren't at 100% or just say nothing at all. That way they know you aren't doing good. If you are confident enough to bring it up with friends on your ig story, then you have it in you to tell a therapist. Why don't you also try bringing it up with one of your friends- the way they treat you? They may not realise what they are doing. Also I'd highly suggest trying to call a hot line, Google some. There's many out there for wherever you are in the world. They aren't all just for crisis, they are there to listen to your worries. Judgement free."

If you can assure them that you are safe at the minute, then they may not. If you're older then they can refer you to a therapy or something that can fit to your needs better. This might not only be what happens, but that's all of what I know of."
SuicideWatch,fq8rq3g,t1_fq8r7gi,1589173663.0,I get that. Sticking around for others doesn't really mean much when your in constant pain. You need to stick around for yourself. It just takes time to build yourself back up.

SuicideWatch,fq8q52e,t3_ghgp6j,1589172438.0,"It most likely depends on the therapist. When I first told someone they didn't tell anyone. They asked me if I was having suicidal thoughts and I said yes. They asked how often and I said everyday. It took persuasion but in the end they agreed not to tell anyone because I promised that if I was on the verge of doing something stupid, then I'd go to hospital. And I assured them family was a block. Tbh I think it's really important you do tell someone about those thoughts because they can easily get worse. It doesn't take a lot to make them worse.

depression,fpjmpiq,t3_gdv7qt,1588674247.0,"Me too. Tbh my logic is, I'll most likely be dead by then anyway so what's the point."
depression,fpjgw7o,t3_gdtxiu,1588668038.0,"Sometimes actions speak for you, I think that if you told someone about things, you'd most likely end up getting upset, and if not then I'm sure your expression would show them that you're struggling. You don't need to go to your parents and tell them ""I'm Suicidal and I've hurt myself"" you can tell them that you've just been having a tough time and then the more you speak about things the easier it'll be, the first few words are the hardest. If you don't want to tell your family, maybe talk to your friends. If not them, then Google some numbers. Idk where you are in the world but there's numbers which aren't just for crisis, they are there to just listen to your problems and to give advice. Self harm is tempting but it's a whole other problem. If you get addicted then you have to try and fight that addiction. There's other healthier coping techniques like until you manage to get therapy or whatever, like distractions. If you get a thought, go for a walk or do some painting or watch TV. It won't cure them but it should prevent you from doing anything stupid until you build up the courage to ask for help. Just do something because doing nothing increases there volume. Your doing good to get this far, keep on going <3"
depression,fphgecu,t3_gdibov,1588620820.0,"That used to happen in the earlier days. I guess school is way more stressful. You have to be someone else for everyone even if you don't mean to be - public appearance. And then there's work. But nowadays I prefer school, it's just a good distraction rather than being in isolation. I hope things improve for you. Maybe talk to a teacher about things, they might make things a bit easier for you in school."
depression,fpg60mx,t1_fpg4gj9,1588595233.0,"Np, I'm impressed that you managed to eat at some point even if it was a bit."
depression,fpg3c0s,t3_gda02f,1588592969.0,Force yourself to even if everything in you is saying no. Maybe if you take a bite then it'll trigger some sort of hunger or it'll confirm that you really don't want to eat.
SuicideWatch,fpg38vt,t3_gda1c5,1588592891.0,Wow that's actually rather annoying. Yeah we've had many chances but we don't always take them because of different circumstances. It take a lot of courage to end your life and only a few bad things to give you the motivation to do it. Clearly they've never been Suicidal
depression,fpfsy6r,t3_gd7y8a,1588582326.0,"To feel suicidal isn't a ""normal"" mental state. But it is curable. There isn't anything to say that it isn't right now but if you leave it too long then it'll get harder to get better from. Going to a doctor about this might put these anxious thoughts to rest. If not, they'll help you through this."
SuicideWatch,fpfgzym,t1_fpeziee,1588570972.0,There isn't rly much you can do then
depression,fpehg02,t3_gd0a0v,1588547624.0,"Maybe try telling him this, whether it's over message or face to face. It'll show him that your grateful but you can't show it but you want to"
SuicideWatch,fpegmgh,t3_gd05xh,1588547162.0,I think sometimes it becomes a sort of addiction
depression,fpe9jj1,t3_gcyzsn,1588543077.0,Reach out for help before it's too late. Catch it early before it gets that bad again.
depression,fpe7tft,t1_fpd9la0,1588542081.0,Sorry for late reply btw
depression,fpe7skz,t1_fpd9la0,1588542067.0,"I understand how you feel but I find that people do still have personality. Sometimes you have people who only answer with ""yes"" and ""no"" and others write paragraphs. It's especially hard during these times so I'm not sure how to help or what to say."
SuicideWatch,fpe69uq,t3_gcyj5s,1588541199.0,I'm sorry life has lead you to this
depression,fpe0a8z,t3_gcxkqb,1588537795.0,Maybe try speaking to someone professional about this. Wherever you got your meds from - therapist/doctor. Maybe they can find something else that'll work for you
SuicideWatch,fpde2od,t3_gctw6t,1588525172.0,"Have you had a cold? When you loose your sense of smell and you can't taste anything, you realise how much you missed being able to smell and taste. It's like that with people. Sometimes you don't notice them until they're gone. They take you for granted and don't realise how much you mean to them until you are no longer around."
SuicideWatch,fpdamt4,t1_fpd897x,1588523224.0,It sounds really difficult. I'm not sure what to say. I guess just remind her that she has you if she ever needs you. Tell her that there's other coping techniques like distractions. Doing art or baking instead of cutting. I had a friend who self harmed and I remember just never really talking to her about it. I would just tell her that I was there if she ever needed to talk and let the therapist handle it all. I would just try and make our friendship as normal as possible and try not to make it evolve around her harming herself. Sorry I'm not sure what to say for this.
