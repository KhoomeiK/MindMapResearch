CasualConversation,fmm7lg5,t3_fvk0n2,1586200265.0,Real neat story. I was hoping for a picture of your coin pile or maybe one of your favored guests.
askatherapist,fmm7d9i,t3_fvhlcz,1586200142.0,"Relationships with parents are very important to individuals. These relationships tend to have a greater impact on an individual's behavior than almost any other relationship. Speaking from personal experience, losing a parent at a young age can be very traumatic both at the time of death and later in life as well.

Some times individuals are resilient and can bounce back from losses like this in life without these events affecting mental health. Whoever this child is, I'd recommend searching for a therapist."
askatherapist,fkxfo2o,t1_fkwcejk,1584627113.0,"I'm glad I've been of some help.

Now that you are older, you should talk to a pro in person. I sincerely wish you the best!"
askatherapist,fkshzuu,t3_fk9cx1,1584490529.0,Yeah it seems clear that you were adversely affected by this threat on your life. The fact that this incident is still causing you panic attacks several years later should just drive that home. And lastly the fact that you chose to post a message about this trauma tells me that you already understand that this pain you are feeling needs professional help.
askatherapist,fkdj9xd,t3_fgctvp,1584080934.0,"It does seem like there is more than one issue at play here. Depression and anxiety disorders look pretty obvious the way you describe things. ADD/ADHD might also be at play. These are all treatable mental health problems. Treatment might include medication.

Now, I have to assume these school councilors have your best interest in mind, but dismissing the real psychological concerns of presumably a minor is something I find blindingly aggravating. Mental health problems are real and without the (easily acquired) treatment can have very serious effects on a person's quality of life. One need only look up the statistics on teen self harm and suicide to figure that out.

Do yourself a favor: go see professional. Your quality of life will be much better."
askatherapist,fkdhzhx,t3_fhpp59,1584079494.0,"In your situation, I think I would want to have a serious and reasoned discussion with my SO about going into couple's therapy. The diagnosis is your husband's, not yours, so it is his choice whether that info gets shared with anybody. On the other hand, he is your spouse and that requires healthy communication and it seems that your knowledge of his condition is causing problems there."
askatherapist,fjmcwxx,t1_fjmakex,1583467222.0,"Sorry things didn't go well for you in college. It is your call, obviously, but I would still encourage you to try if you can. Or perhaps find some alternative for your situation.

I sincerely wish you the best of luck in what ever you decide to do. If nothing else, know you are not alone. I hope things work out well for you."
askatherapist,fjm1na2,t1_fjkgws6,1583459523.0,"If a degree is what is holding you back, why not pursue a degree? Community colleges allow students to knock out preleminary courses cheaply and at your own pace. Here in the US, the government funds the Pell grant which should cover the cost of your courses and study materials like textbooks, usually with some left over if you qualify for the full grant. After that you can easily transfer to get your full bachelor's or further if you want. A degree is not some impossible to achieve goal and realistically any career path you choose will be better if you have a degree in your field. In your shoes, I'd look into local community colleges, they have advisors who can show you the opportunities in depth. Or you could even look into another field if you wanted.

Just from my point of view on the outside, it looks like your job situation is your number one problem and your currently untreated state being the other. ADHD can be a slippery problem if left untended. If you was diagnosed by a professional then I have to assume they were correct since it seems things were going better for you when you was being treated. Sorting out the job problem and getting health insurance so you can resume treatment is important."
askatherapist,fjk5zop,t1_fjjattw,1583420801.0,"12hr fasting is simply suboptimal for nutrition. Without going into all the biological elements, it changes the homeostasis in your body, and not for the better. Ideally, you'd want a few meals throughout the day with healthy snacks in between. 

It is good you have friends that you can count on as you mention. That is just another thing you have going for you, another good thing. Different people manage emotions in different ways and some are taught that emotions shouldn't be shared openly. Again, I know nothing of your friends, but that stutter you mention that happens some times with them could possibly be that you are more aware of your own emotional state than they.

Job security seems to be a pressure point for you. Since it is something so far removed from what I do, I have no idea how to measure just how secure you are there, but you paint an image that suggests things are going well. You are on track to eliminate debts as well. I guess my point here: is your concerns about losing your job reasonable or unreasonable? Since the image I am seeing suggests things are well, I'd have to wonder if it is unreasonable. Are you close enough to your boss/supervisor to simply ask? That might settle some of the nerves you are showing.

You mention ADHD, something you haven't mentioned before. Are you taking meds for that? You mentioned before that healthcare isn't something you can easily access right now so it is important to maintain whatever regimen you were on until you can re-establish care.

Just talking to you on here you seem to me to be at least a moderately successful person of some means. I don't know what your situation is like fully, but I'd advise that you budget out some funds so you can talk to a therapist face to face. Things seem okay right now, but with there being a diagnosed disorder it is important that you have a professional who can keep a more comprehensive eye on things in person."
askatherapist,fjja5vi,t1_fjhrh11,1583387958.0,"It isn't bad of you to post a question asking for input on your situation. Humans are social creatures and reach out to each other when they need help. I'm just one anonymous voice in cyberspace, but I think it is clear you are feeling hurt, so here you are.

Self-esteem issues are really common. We can see abject poverty and abject luxury with a few clicks on the internet and most people are trying to figure out where they stand between those two extremes. Some people overestimate how well they are doing, others underestimate. I know almost nothing about you, but it sounds like you have a career in front of you. That alone means that, statistically speaking, you are doing better than the majority of the human race. I'm not trying to downplay your right to feel however you feel about yourself, but it is important to keep a good sense of perspective. You have family, enough money to send to that family while still supporting yourself and access to First World luxuries, so I have to think you must be doing well for yourself to some degree.

And for what it is worth you should try and curb the bad food habit that you are building. Not just poor quality fast food, but fasting for half a day at a time as well which is potentially worse. You sound like you are familiar with exercising, so you should be aware already that using food to cope is less than ideal. You really should try and correct things before it goes any farther.

Like I said before I'm just one voice on the internet, but I am sincerely hoping for your success."
askatherapist,fjhqppw,t3_fdgbre,1583353313.0,"It sounds to me like you have some stress/anxiety disorder. Also it looks like you have pretty low self-esteem. 

There are a lot of lifestyle choices that can help deal with anxiety. Things like proper exercise and diet, journaling, meditation, etc are just a few things that can help. From the way you describe things it doesn't sound like your anxious moments are debilitating so medication may not be necessary for you. A therapist can help you figure out if that is necessary or not.

Self-esteem is another thing that may not need medical intervention. You describe yourself as 'an ass' and describe yourself as a 'useless guy'. This, in the same post that you describe advanced skills in writing code and building software. You see the contradiction, right? If you were truly useless, you would not be able to do the things you do for a living. I know for a fact that I'm completely useless when it comes to trying to code anything, it just does not compute. What I'm getting at here is that you are selling yourself short and not giving yourself credit for the things you can do and have done in the past."
askatherapist,fjhoqhg,t3_fddslq,1583352232.0,"Your situation is interesting because I see a lot of differing thoughts clashing. ""Kids are too young to begin learning about death"" vs ""they will learn at some point, so be honest with them so they begin to learn"", not to mention approaching from the psychological angle vs a religious one and lots of other factors as well.

These kids are young now and maybe they don't fully understand what death means right now (I imagine it varies between the three), but they are going to spend the rest of their lives figuring it out. There is this vague idea that children should be shielded from the truth because they are too young, but I think this approach only shields adults from needing to deal with these children's trauma.

Some day, each of these siblings will have to reconcile that they lost their mother. To me the problem right now should be, ""how can these minors right now learn how to best deal with loss?"" I think the answer to that is to validate their emotions, not try and shield them from their own emotions because that is never really possible in the long term. Loss is something that happens in life and unfortunately, this is not the last loss these children will have to deal with, so it is in their best interest to help them learn how to deal with emotional trauma in a healthy way.

Sorry for you loss as well, since it seems you are close to this family. Death is never easy to deal with. I wish you all well."
askatherapist,fjcczda,t1_fjby6h3,1583215533.0,"I'm not saying you do/did anything wrong. Your original question was whether finding control to be sexually arousing is something you need to fix. My answer is that human sexuality is complicated. People form fetishes around all kinds of ideas and concepts. As long as your fetish for control is done with a willing partner then no, it isn't something that needs changing. If your fantasies involve unwilling partners, on the other hand, then that is something that does need work."
askatherapist,fjbxhac,t3_fcnqxy,1583203596.0,"It depends on a lot of factors, I'd say. Plenty of people are well-adjusted individuals who are interested in fetishes that involve power play. Then again there are people who get obsessed with this idea of sexual control that it taken to extremes that cross boundaries of what can be considered acceptable.

If your desire for control involves controlling someone who is not a consenting adult then yeah it is problematic. If you have a partner who is also into power play dynamics then as long as things are consensual then you are probably fine."
askatherapist,fip4f9t,t1_fip1v60,1582597791.0,I sincerely wish you the best of luck in the future. Good luck.
askatherapist,fip4bxj,t1_fiou2k5,1582597733.0,"I was just putting myself into the hypothetical position of a therapist who is trying to understand the issue that you are dealing with.

Religion is not a monolith. I'm not sure why these people are inspiring such negativity in you, but I think it is a mistake to discriminate against them solely on the basis of their religion. Is it these people's religion that is causing your violent fantasies? Or is it their specific actions against you that is causing your vitriol? That is what a therapist would likely try and figure out."
askatherapist,fiovvnm,t3_f8zu8k,1582592219.0,"The first thought is that it should be said that seeking help, either here or elsewhere, is not a sign of weakness. People on this sub are here because they want to help for lots of different reasons. I'm sure others will agree that it is a good thing you are seeking help. 

Digressing, in your post I see symptoms that could be caused by a number of different disorders. Depression is an obvious possibility (oversleeping, excess eating, thoughts about death), but that doesn't explain everything. The mood swings could be a symptom of something else like bipolar or borderline. The first symptom you mention is somewhat unclear whether you are having dissociative episodes (seeing yourself in the different scenarios you mentioned) or if that is perhaps simply something you are fantasying about. The talking to yourself may not necessarily be a symptom here as people do sometimes talk to themselves, but it might be a symptom depending on the specific circumstances of how exactly that works for you.

So yeah in short it seems like there is something going on with you in terms of mental health. You should see a therapist in order to pin down what exactly is going on in your mind and so you can get assistance."
askatherapist,fiotonb,t1_filpb40,1582590734.0,"It is a broad question with a lot of room for interpretation obviously. But if it were me, I'd focus on why someone else's religious choices are having such a strong impact on you. I imagine there is a reason for that and identifying this reason will hopefully help transition these negative feelings that are contributing to a destructive fantasy into positive feelings that can help you cope in dealing with people who believe in different world views."
askatherapist,filp4et,t3_f8j2mn,1582506923.0,"Hi again. You have my answer from last time and I stand by that response. But I will add to it. 

A therapist's primary concern is with promoting healing. It is clear that you are very upset with some people for some reason, maybe even good reasons. But a therapist's goal will be to identify why you've developed this fantasy and they will have to make a judgment call on whether this situation warrants breaking confidentiality or not. That really depends on the specifics of your policy which is derived from where you live and a lot of other things as well. 

So yes, a therapist would do something about it. They would try and promote your safety and healing. They'd try and help you sort out the reason for this fantasy so that you can let these feelings go."
askatherapist,filndq5,t3_f8h3vu,1582505706.0,"You ask if this is normal, but anybody reading this post doesn't have a lot of details to work with to give a comprehensive answer. You mention a memory and being in the mindset you were in at the time of the memory, but no actual details about this original incident. Also it is unclear whether your feelings of depression and anxiety are tied to this incident or if they are unrelated entirely.

In other words, people here would be happy to give you feedback, but your original post lacks lots of critical details necessary to give you a good answer."
askatherapist,fic2ivf,t3_f7lgny,1582336011.0,"Different countries have differing policies for breaking patient confidentiality, so check out the guidelines for where you live for specifics. That said, in the US, usually, no your therapist cannot break confidentiality except in certain extreme circumstances. Like if you told your therapist you were actively planning on killing someone soon then yes confidentiality may be broken to protect someone else from imminent harm."
askatherapist,fi29kkc,t1_fhz8jxp,1582074636.0,Then I am inclined to think that it is just due to you lacking personal experience with infants as opposed to you being psychopathic.

askatherapist,fgon2t8,t1_fgohs9y,1580976742.0,"That is an interesting turn of events. For what it is worth, I am glad on your behalf that something unexpected turned into such an opportunity for healing. And of course you are welcome as well for the conversation. From one anonymous voice on the internet to another, I sincerely wish you the best of luck with your mother and brother."
askatherapist,fgnno79,t1_fgkwcot,1580948846.0,"I'd note that now we are talking about this event where you overslept due to being sick (I'm thinking of this as incident 1 now for simplicity) in a very different way. In your original post this was an isolated incident, now you are saying it is a pattern of inefficiency I suppose. That is why seeing a therapist IRL would be more beneficial as I, an anonymous name on the Net, can only interpret info through your lense and word choice. Thus, seeing someone in person will be of much greater help as they can get a complete view of what exactly is happening with as little bias as possible.

Anyway. Imagine another couple of people who were in your circumstances. SO 1 is sick, oversleeps, thus SO 2 is mildly inconvenienced. How might they resolve this in a healthy way? Yelling is *not an option.* Severing communication is *not an option.* Talking, understanding, and resolving any remaining negative feelings *are options.*

This is an example of healthy communication and ideally that issue would have been put to bed and forgiven and they both walk away happy. That does not sound like your relationship in any way whatsoever.

So to answer your last question, does communicating her side make her seem more reasonable? Yes. Does it change the fact that there is a lot of other unhealthy behavior? No. ""Punishing"" a SO with either a fiery argument or icy silence does not detract from the fact that you both should be seeking resolution and healing, not inflicting more emotional harm via punishment on each other. Of course it is open to interpretation, that is what a relationship is. My interpretation is that you do not sound happy in this relationship and your attempts to right things in a healthy manner have been thoroughly rebuffed.

Unless this interpetation of your situation is wrong, then I'd refer you to my last post. Either this is price you are willing to pay for this relationship or it isn't. You can play for time and try to change things but since you have already been in couples therapy and this is the result, that does not sound probable in the near future."
askatherapist,ffycsq5,t1_ffvnxyd,1580343351.0,"I feel like I don't have a full understanding of the situation. Your first post you mentioned your brother was being supportive of your efforts to see a therapist and your brother thought you should plan this confrontation. Now that you've thought about it, you have decided against confronting her. But now your brother is talking to your mother about something. What exactly did he do? Confirm that you are seeing a therapist?

And I wouldn't go about avoiding your mother. If she brings up her past abuses then you don't have to engage her in that conversation if you do not want."
askatherapist,ffvd0w7,t1_ffths56,1580261236.0,"Oh yeah, I wasn't meaning to imply that you should ask him, that is what a therapist is for. Sorry if I gave that impression, it wasn't my intent.

I wish you both the best of luck."
askatherapist,ffswqio,t1_ffs8ymn,1580195598.0,"Sounds like there are some feelings wrapped up in your working, maybe because you are working alongside your daughter. Add to that being being a full time student I imagine there has been some increasing stress and tension.

This is especially true if there have been any big recent changes in life or any traumatic recent events. Since this has been an issue for a few years you say, is there anything big in life that has changed? Move to live somewhere else, changes in family or work life, etc? Any of these and others could be potential catalysts."
askatherapist,ffs5q6f,t3_euj6cy,1580173800.0,"Yeah, quite likely a stress induced panic attack.

askatherapist,ffnwbis,t1_ffme1b9,1580071571.0,"I think you are right in that this particular ship has sailed but I'm sure there will be someone else in the future. It is an unfortunate thing that so many women in our society have past traumas like what you describe with your ex. For what it is worth I think it is admirable that you put in the effort to try with her. If nothing else I imagine this was a learning experience so any future relationships can be handled better. I'd recommend more communication by something other than text at a minimum.

And I do hope I did help in some small way. Best of luck to you."
askatherapist,ffkvmh0,t3_eu28gm,1580029805.0,"There is a lot we don't fully understand about the brain but we have figured out a lot of stuff in the recent past. To the best of my knowledge memories cannot be erased at will. It is reasonable to say though that it is likely that you tune out certain details though.

People often think of memories like recording a video in perfect clarity that is recalled at will. In reality, our memory is more like a mental reconstruction of past memory and thus is very prone to reinterpretation, loss of detail, and in extreme cases repression. Deletion though? No."
askatherapist,ffkv1xc,t3_eu3lwy,1580029464.0,"Every situation is different so it is hard to make a blanket answer for something like this. Some of the language you used gives me the impression that if you did face your mother it would be in a confrontational or argumentative manner. Going into a conversation with that attitude is more likely to do harm rather than healing. And what is the point of therapy if not healing?

Best case scenario she might accept that she was abusive in the past. Worse case scenario is that this could open more wounds. Talk to your therapist about it but I doubt there is much to be gained and much to be lost here."
askatherapist,ffktyrj,t3_eu1p9p,1580028831.0,"Just to echo some other voices, it certainly follows the standard pattern for abuse. I understand there are still feelings and confusion involved here so I'm not trying to make light of that, but it does look like you dodged a bullet here. Things could have gone a lot worse and I am glad that it didn't."
askatherapist,ffk0996,t1_ffjnuys,1580011870.0,"I think you should direct your big question to her, honestly. One person might say yes they are willing to try and be more open emotionally, and another person might say they are not able to be more open. Trauma is unique to every individual, almost like a fingerprint. The only person who can answer your big question is her.

I don't think it is unreasonable to ask for more communication or more time spent together from a romantic partner and that is what she was, a romantic partner. Like any other cooperative relationship there is a give and take and the way you describe things don't sound unreasonable asks in a relationship. Projecting past relationship baggage into a current one is not healthy but considering her past it is not unsurprising that it became an issue.

Since you are seemingly still in contact with her it sounds like neither of you actually wanted to break up. Maybe she didn't realize she was being inconsiderate of your needs until you broke things off with her? I don't know the whole situation obviously but from what I am hearing I think you may have jumped the gun on ending the relationship before posing these questions to her and seeing if some kind of course correction was possible or not."
askatherapist,ffj48c7,t3_etle3l,1579989982.0,"It isn't uncommon for a victim of abuse to have a difficult time working up to the point where they can feel comfortable with things like physical contact or sexual activity. What I am seeing here is that in this relationship you want more physical intimacy than she is willing to give. Because of that, you ended the relationship but are wanting to maintain the hope that you two can try again at some point in the future?

I think you need to do some introspection. You weren't getting what you wanted out of the relationship, presumably sexual activity. But you are still heavily focused on your ex and her healing. Is it not possible for you and her to simply maintain a friendship while you search for a relationship that might be more personally fulfilling for you? You were unwilling to wait for her to be ready for sex but now you are willing to wait?

Figure out what you want. Determine if your ex is capable of giving that or not. If she isn't, then there isn't much point waiting for something that really may never come."
askatherapist,ffj23pf,t3_etsd2o,1579988461.0,"What you are describing sounds like dissociation or some kind of psychosis. The terms are often used interchangeably but describe differing things. Dissociation tends to describe the feeling that the world is real but you are not attached to it. Psychosis on the other hand is difficulty determining what is real.

Both are treatable but you need to see a doctor who can help diagnose the specific issue you are having and take steps from there."
askatherapist,ffiue3l,t3_etu1n4,1579982966.0,"How old was your partner at the time? Was he close in age to you or significantly older? If older then he knew he was playing with fire. Even if he believed you were 17 at the time, he was still aware that it was too early to be healthy. Based on your description of things I'd say he was at least partially responsible for his fate. 

That said, it does sound like he was trying to be considerate for you at the time. You did deceive him though by lying about your age. I'd like to think that seeing a 15 year old should have thrown some red flags for him as you probably looked 15 at the time and he should have been more diligent on confirming your age before becoming intimate (if for no other reason to protect himself).

This is a tangled mess at trying to figure out whether his punishment fit the crime or not. You shouldn't have lied to him, and he should have been absolutely sure of your age so there is some responsibility on both sides. And there had to have been something more that scared you aside from the pain of your first time to make you think he was dangerous enough to report him.

In any case as you said yourself the past cannot be changed. You clearly feel guilty over this situation. People make mistakes and since you see this as one of yours, then you should take this experience to heart in order to curb your self perceived confirming impulsiveness and irresponsibility."

As another commenter wrote, the end goal for your brother will probably be a care community of some kind so that your brother can live a semi-independent life. It will take some work to get there but considering the situation now, it will be worth it."
askatherapist,ffhic3s,t1_ffgy6ey,1579936551.0,Yeah you don't need to tell any specifics but it should give you a place to start. Figuring out what exactly it is that you are focusing on will give clues as to what exactly you are searching for in these people.
askatherapist,ffgojf9,t1_ffgm4zg,1579911092.0,"Competency will be handled through the legal system. What that entails varies from country to country. I live in the US so I'm only somewhat familiar with our legal system here. If you live in the US, speak with an attorney, preferably one that is familiar with family and health issues near where you live. They will be able to walk you through the procedure to try and start a competency case or at least refer you to a professional who will.

And yeah, try and talk to your brother about how you care and want him to be better. If you are lucky he will comply on his own so the legal issue can be sidestepped entirely if possible. Honestly though from your description of him, he may just ignore you attempt at communication since that is his go-to coping mechanism. Since he has not dealt with health issues in the past, I wouldn't get my hopes up here. And you may want to not mention that you are looking into legal action as he may not respond very well here or otherwise get defensive. I don't know about his mental capacity but he may try preempt any legal action unpredictably. You didn't describe him as violent but people can act desperately when they feel threatened and worst case he could become violent with you.

And you are welcome, by the way. I can tell you care about him a lot. I hope that this has been at least in some small way helpful and I am hoping this goes well for you both!"

This family member (a parent it sounds like) seems to have issues of her own and is inserting herself into areas of your life which you want to be kept to yourself. If it was me, I'd first have a heart to heart with her and make it very clear that are areas in life in which she is not welcome (like your therapy sessions) and ask that she return the respect she expects from you by not intruding. If she loves you then she should trust and respect the boundaries. 

If she does not respect the boundaries then you may need to make some adjustments in your life. Must you live with her? Can you not schedule your sessions so that she will not be around to listen in? Can you have your therapy somewhere she cannot go? Do what it takes to ensure boundaries are maintained so that your therapist can give you much more specific advice on how to handle things in a healthy, positive manner."

That is probably not what you want to hear, but even if he feels the same way about you that you do him, that is a line that should not be crossed.

You've identified the problem - idealizing certain people - so you are already taking positive steps. Take a look at all the people you have idealized and look at what they all have in common. There is a reason you are focusing so heavily on certain people, you just need to identify that reason so you can attempt to change it.

And that is okay, thats what your therapist is for, to help guide you through this new experience.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean by trying to break free of being controlled by others, I assume you mean family or something? And I'm not sure what you mean by someone being around you when you see your therapist. Your sessions should be between just you and the therapist, having someone else there is seemingly making you withhold info from your therapist which is not beneficial at all."

But far and away the worst thing is that he is either unable or unwilling to seek treatment. There are people who are able to help, but if he does not seek that help, then there isn't much that can be done alone by you.

I'm not sure what country you are from, but at least here in the US it may be possible to get a competency case for him. Under those conditions, someone else (like you, a family member) can take legal control of his affairs including the power to have him committed somewhere even against his wishes. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know all the details or steps to take or if it is even practical given your situation. This option does have serious ramifications and is not to be taken lightly, but if the situation is as dire as you explain it, it may be the only option. Should you go this route it would probably be in your brother's best interest to be committed somewhere so all his issues can be identified and treated comprehensively.

I hope it doesn't come down to this nuclear option but if he is a threat to himself or others (wreckless endangerment by driving and falling asleep for example) then this is something you should consider and consult with a legal professional. I doubt that this is the kind of advice you want to hear. But as you said, he needs *serious* help. Help starts with treatment and he seems unwilling or unable to seek it himself."
askatherapist,ffes0cx,t3_esumbj,1579862704.0,"Before I even say anything else, I just want to say that I admire the obvious care you have for your SO. It well and truly warmed my heart.

Therapy is something to be encouraged here and the support you are already showing is important, but that goes without saying.

Guilt is a difficult topic for a lot of reasons such as political, religious, and ethical background. What specifically he fills guilty about is a big part of guilt resolution. Was it the abortion? Does he think he precipitated the following miscarriage? Does he think he 'damaged' the previous SO? There are so many angles that could possibly be the *root cause* of his remorse. Layering on top of that is the question of, 'is this guilty feeling reasonable?' For example, if he is feeling guilty about thinking he directly caused the abortion, then is it reasonable to say he is responsible for that abortion? Technically, it was his previous SO's decision to go through a medical procedure and thus the responsibility is out of his hands entirely unless he somehow forced her to abort.

So it is important to know specifically what is causing the feeling of guilt as well as establishing if that feeling is reasonable or not. There are a lot of different angles to cover but fundamentally he should not feel guilty over something he is not responsible for. If he is feeling guilty over something he is reasonably responsible for then it is a matter of putting that guilt to rest. We cannot change the past but we can accept it and move forward. And moving forward is ultimately the end goal for guilt resolution."

Identify specific actions (or lack of actions) that have made people consider you cold. Is it that you don't show a lot of empathy in conversation? Is it that you don't talk freely? Whatever it is, identifying the specific reason is important so you can then be aware of what needs to change.

So yes absolutely there is hope for you to change."
askatherapist,ff7qhhe,t3_es0whp,1579655886.0,"Before you ask the question of how you can change I think it might be better to start with should you change. You mention only one person telling you that he perceives you as being cold and condescending. And while that may be the case, is he the only one who has told you this?

I get the feeling that your thread here is maybe a cry for help. But I'm not sure because it seems at the least that your feelings have changed somehow between your first post and followup posts. I'm trying to be helpful but I don't think there is much more I can say at this point."

The idea of 'normal' changes; for example in Saudi Arabia, women have far fewer rights than here in the West. Due to religion, history, culture, and a ton of other things the idea of a normal person is both ubiquitous and false.

But here and now I am trying to understand why this rubs you the wrong way so deeply. Here in the West we also have one of the most progressive societies which celebrates diversity. Clearly there is something in particular bugging you, but aside from people wanting you to socialize more, I have no idea what that is and thus can't say anything that might be helpful for your situation."
askatherapist,ff2h1h2,t1_ff1zhj3,1579505790.0,"Relationships and trust are kind of like currency. You spend a little trust to open a relationship with the intent that you will get an emotional return on that trust, thus deepening the relationship which makes it easier to invest more trust, raising the 'credit rating' so to speak.

Taking this metaphor a step further, it sounds like you had someone in the past you invested heavily in and they broke that trust. You, in turn, have isolated yourself because you didn't want to get burned again. If you don't care about anybody, it won't hurt if they break your trust. While this coping mechanism may have prevented you from feeling hurt, it has also prevented healthy growth. So now it sounds like you have someone you want to invest in, which is great. But you are also cautious as you don't want to get hurt ever again. And I think you already know what the right choice is here. Open up, just a bit. Baby steps now until you get more experience under your belt.

And you are welcome again. I've not been on this sub long but I find myself looking for those threads that look like they really need a sounding board of some kind but aren't getting many replies. I do that because I know what it is like to be on the other side; asking for help in the infinite void of the Net only to be met with a resounding silence. So I am quite sincere when I say I am glad to have helped in some small manner. I wish you the best of luck."
askatherapist,ff2g662,t1_ff1ul30,1579504731.0,"On sociopathy and psychopathy: people often think of them as a binary thing but it is not. More like a sliding scale. Ask some psychological researchers and they might say that many non-psychopaths exhibit psychopathic traits and the same thing with sociopathy. Talk to your therapist next chance you get since your own internal inventory came back partially positive and even if you don't hit enough points to be diagnosed either way, those are certainly points you'd want to try and correct if possible.

And for what it is worth I'm pretty new to Reddit myself but I can understand how it might be easier to articulate some thoughts and feelings here. There is no threat that anything said here could come back to you IRL and of course, some people find it easier to communicate through a written medium rather than verbal. it is the same reason why often therapists encourage journaling. Just in this case, sometimes the journal talks back, so to speak. If nothing else I'm glad that this is giving you some comfort."

As an introvert myself it just means acknowledging that you are a little bit different from (seemingly) the people you spend your time with. Some people are extroverts and can socialize forever, but personally I find that sort of lifestyle exhausting. Try and find connections with people who share more things in common with yourself."
askatherapist,ff1rhz1,t3_eqwui6,1579484570.0,"Well, we are human and human behaviors have a wide range, like a spectrum. And individuals fall somewhere on those spectra. Humans are also quite judgy at times and have preconceived ideas of what it means to be 'normal' for various reasons, sometimes benign and other times maliciously.

Thus, you. In what way do people say you are not 'normal'? You are asking us here 'why do people think I am not normal?' but you don't say why others have called you non-normal. Without knowing that, I doubt you will get much meaningful feedback."
askatherapist,ff1q4bu,t3_er1i3x,1579483694.0,"This may sound insulting but I hope you will understand that I am using a couple of words in their clinical sense here. Have you ever been diagnosed as having either psychopathic or sociopathic traits? Both of these personality disorders can cause some of the symptoms you mention such as the inability to form meaningful relationships. If you are not sure, do some research on those terms like on Wikipedia and see if you might fall into one of those categories.

Alternatively, yes it is possible that you are, on some level, preventing yourself from forming relationships as a coping mechanism from your past trauma. It can hurt when relationships sour so perhaps you are preventing anybody from getting close in an effort to minimize your (perceived) vulnerability. If this is the case then the only fix is to open yourself up emotionally and trust that the other person does not want to hurt you, quite the opposite usually. Humans are social creatures by nature. Cutting out social relationships are unhealthy behaviors, both initially and ongoing into the future."
askatherapist,ff1o89z,t3_equ9p2,1579482499.0,"We live in strange times. Human civilization has advanced more in the past few decades than the thousands of years of civilization prior. And now our modern society puts so much pressure on us to try and be more and do more constantly. I think the way you phrased your first post says a lot about society these days. 

You say your goals in life right now are to have a small family, a normal job and grow old. Historically, these were huge aspirations! But now through our modern lens, we consider these aspirations reletively small. Not everybody is going to break new scientific ground like Einstein, change human rights like Martin Luther King, or be as rich as Elon Musk. Compared to the average person, those people are titans who very few people will ever be equal to. 

I don't see your declared aspirations as small or not 'aiming high' as you put it. And that is okay. As long as you feel your life is worth living, then you are on the right track."
askatherapist,fevir17,t1_fet0rdj,1579397889.0,"People get frustrated, sometimes reasonably and sometimes unreasonably. From what you are describing, it certainly sounds like these situations are unreasonable. Your given example of you being sick and thus sleeping a little longer than planned is a perfect example of an unreasonable response; as a form of punishment you have had all communication severed with the person you are engaged with, for multiple days in a row. Imagine how she might react if you did this to her the next time you got frustrated at her.

This kind of behavior is, in my opinion, unacceptable between two people who are planning on spending the rest of their lives together. She is getting 'frustrated' far too easily and reacting to an unacceptable degree for any behavior she sees as less than perfect. Even if her personality was so radically different from yours as to be labeled a different type (which sounds dishonest here), that does not justify an out of proportion response like this.

Put simply I don't think you are the problematic partner in this relationship, she is. If she is unable or unwilling to make significant changes to how she deals with her unreasonable frustration, then that leaves you with a couple of options. One, accept it as the price you will have pay to be with her for the duration of your relationship. Or two, don't."
askatherapist,fem3wba,t3_epuec8,1579238898.0,"I think it depends on why you are still upset.

From your post, I am not sure if you are more upset at the uncle's best friend or your family ""knowing"" that there was something happening. You mention you were in high school but not an actual age and depending on where you live, you may have been at the age of consent. Is it possible that your family thought there was a consensual relationship? If it is a matter of being upset with your family, then maybe clarifying the issue may lead to some resolution there.

If it is the uncle's best friend you are still upset with, then try and identify what specifically is still upsetting you. That this person avoided justice? That other people may have been abused? Something else entirely?"
askatherapist,felnz97,t3_epouzk,1579226733.0,"The biggest problem here is that she has stated explicitly and seemingly repeatedly that she does not want to see a therapist. Because of this, you really are at a dead-end here. That is probably not what you want to hear, but you need to hear it. If she is unwilling or unable to see a therapist now then you are very unlikely to get her to change her mind regardless of what you want her to do.

That said, it looks like you are in a troubled relationship. I have a friend who is trans as well and she sounds a lot like your girlfriend. Not to speculate too broadly but I think some of the behaviors you mention come from being trans and not having the right kind of support network. Things like social isolation, extreme emotional responses, inability to work or no desire to work, depression, anxiety, and other negative behaviors can be prevalent. And unfortunately, if your girlfriend is unwilling to work on fixing these problems there is nothing you can do to fix it for her.

What you can do is tend to yourself. I imagine it would be painful to hear her say that she didn't love you. You admit that it made you feel rage and sadness and really this relationship strikes me as deeply unhealthy. I understand that she has had a hard life and you have tried to be supportive. But not all problems can be fixed especially when the person in question adamantly refuses to change. You say that she 'doesn't really feel that way' but I think the question needs to be asked, *are you sure*?"

While it is good that you are no longer having explosive arguments, that has transitioned to very protracted periods of weaponized silence with the (seeming) intention of forcing your capitulation when there is a point of contention. That is, at best, moving from one form of poor conflict resolution behavior to another. It seems you are self-aware of this fact but you try to defend her behavior for some reason even as you know it's unhealthy. If anything this looks like a step in the wrong direction from your explosive arguments.

To answer your question 'Does it matter if her intention isn’t malicious': yes. It is passively malicious and you fully admit that her behavior is making you 'miserable' for days at a time. I can only assume she understands that her behavior is causing severe emotional damage to you? If so then this strikes me a form of manipulation and possible emotional abuse."

All the elements you mention about the real house sound like classic nightmare fuel. Since there was a custody fight going on at the time it seems like those elements combined with the fears you experienced during the custody battle to produce this nightmare. The question then becomes, why is this a recurring dream? My best guess is that there are still issues stemming from that time which have nod been adequately dealt with yet. Maybe there is something specific that needs to be handled (like a relationship that was harmed during that time of your life) or something more generalized (like fear of abandonment as an example). I think identifying what exactly you found traumatizing about the experience will help lead to resolving this dream."
askatherapist,fefz5zf,t1_fefuxjn,1579070235.0,"I think your post here could be analyzed from multiple different angles on how things should not be in a relationship. Any relationship is going to have points of contention but those should be an exception to an otherwise healthy partnership but the way you describe things paints the relationship as being nothing but points of contention. Obvious problems I am seeing: malicious critique, 'keeping score' and citing (seemingly) previously resolved issues, intentionally shutting down channels of communication (seemingly as a means of manipulation to get you to capitulate to her demands), when communicating not being clear on the initial cause, consistent pattern of lack of patience when communicating,rebound arguments, then starting the cycle over again.

You are engaged so either there is an underlying problem of which these sub-issues are symptomatic of, or seemingly something has changed in the relationship. Has the relationship always been like this? Not trying to sound overly harsh but I think this is portraying a toxic relationship and I'm wondering, 'how did these two get engaged under these conditions?'"
askatherapist,fefui6y,t1_fefsqp2,1579065613.0,"It is easy to understand the frustration if it feels like something the therapist said is being 'weaponized' against you for lack of a better term.

Depending on who you talk to dreams range in importance from random and meaningless to useful means of understanding subconscious feelings. I think that dreams and nightmares are usually both and it is the context that determines its meaningfulness.

Since this recurring dream has a fearful or uncertainty theme to it I think it obvious that you internalized some of that turbulence you experienced during the tug of war that often is a custody fight. Was there something about this house in particular that made you feel afraid? Maybe some kind of argument your grandmother had there? That is what I'd assume to have been the origination of this dream.

askatherapist,fefrewx,t3_eowim5,1579063012.0,"It is good that you want to support your sibling. The first thing coming to me is, why do you consider this current therapist to be of poor quality? Therapy varies from patient to patient and some times therapy can have a rough start or since you are not the actual client in question, is it not possible that things have improved but you are simply not seeing the positive effects yet for whatever reason? Your family just had some kind of family session, what was the purpose there? If your sibling has an issue family-related, is it not possible that simply getting your sibling to the point where they can have an open channel of communication with them is actually a sign of forward progress?

What I am getting at is that there are a lot of details missing here before anybody can say 'no, this therapist is clearly wrong.' We have no info on what the exact issue your sibling sought treatment for, how long they have been seeing a therapist in general or this one specifically, any kind of diagnosis made, general information about your sibling like age and gender, etc. 

But just for the sake of argument lets say this therapist is *empirically* poor. Then you'd want to see if alternative therapists are an option for your sibling as they are the one who will have to make the judgment call on whether this one is being effective or not."

askatherapist,fefjotl,t3_eovkly,1579057751.0,"Humans are biologically programmed to seek social connections and to belong and be loved by those we care about so it is hard to say definitively here.

So by definition yes it is possible that this excessive insecurity because of your appearance could be tied to your condition. On the other hand, it is normal for people to desire acceptance.

So I guess it is a matter of degree here. Does it feel like this insecurity is beyond the scope of what is considered normal? If so, then this is probably tied to your already diagnosed disorder."

As you identified yourself, she did not have your consent and that really is the end of the question of whether this was abuse or not. You didn't mention how old you were at the time of this incident but I get the impression you were not legally capable of giving consent either.

You don't really pose a specific question here, but since you suffered a trauma that caused a dissociated state I think it would be in your best interest to find someone you can talk to about this in person."
askatherapist,fed1pqd,t3_eofouz,1578994287.0,"First, I just want to offer my sympathy. Sounds like you are having a real hard time. You should talk to a therapist as you have suffered a trauma. From what you describe, it sounds like you could be developing PTSD and the sooner you begin treating, prognosis tends to improve (symptoms lessening, fewer episodes, etc). And it really depends on a lot of different factors but yes, healing is real. And with proper treatment and support things will get better with time.

In case you are experiencing something besides PTSD, it looks like perhaps some kind of panic disorder. Without getting actual treatment in person it is hard to say with any degree of certainty since most of the critical details here are missing but a therapist will be able to more accurately diagnose what is going on. Try to communicate as clearly as you can with as much detail as you can.

Therapists have a lot of well researched material they lean on when conducting a session and TV is not one of them.

You volunteered your parents' relationship as a less than ideal model relationship which tells me that at least you think their relationship history is a factor in these panic attacks you are now experiencing. That could mean that there was some form of abuse in your past (you mention 'rages' in your youth) which is now manifesting as this unwanted fear or panic response. A therapist will help you work through these past issues.

When you are intimate with someone, try and be aware that you are with someone who cares and ideally is aware that there has been some past trauma. Don't rush sex, go slow. Often panic attacks pass shortly after the initial adrenal response. Try and build positive connections with sex and intimacy. Sex is something that should be fun and enjoyable between partners. It may take more than one encounter before you get to the point where panic gives way to happiness, but it is possible and achievable."

askatherapist,fe6orpg,t1_fe6auai,1578898518.0,"There is a chance that your history of the school discovering the adult material you searched for wasn't 'maladaptive'. You were going through puberty and already have expressed interest in bondage. That isn't my flavor but from what I have heard other people express interest in are the elements of trust, control, power play, exposure, and the feeling of being at someone else's mercy. Everything you have stated so far looks to me like a clear interest in wanting to experience these elements.

I have a hypothesis. When you were at the school, was knowing (not suspecting or fearing, but *knowing)* that eventually your actions would come to light play a role in your decision-making process (as in, a potential turn on)? If so, I can't help but wonder if you were hoping that the faculty would find out about your activities and in so doing you'd experience some of those positive elements that you saw in porn. But instead of experiencing any of those positive feelings you instead experienced fear and shame which have now shut down your bondage interest because of this incident.

Maybe I am reading the situation wrong but from the way you describe events I get the impression that you were curious about something which is normally harmless and sexual (bondage) and tried to experiment. That experiment did not go how you wanted or expected and now you are afraid that the whole thing was unhealthy from the beginning thus leading to this conversation."
askatherapist,fe6795z,t3_ensl8a,1578883368.0,"I'll echo Lilaer, relationships are not mathematical equations which can be solved by analyzing an issue through the proper modality or methodology. 

He is doing X which is making you feel Y. I'm getting the impression that this is an ongoing pattern so what exactly is X, and why does that make you feel Y? Without knowing the whole picture it is hard to say, but is X here something truly objectionable or otherwise unacceptable? Is your Y reasonable and if so does he understand why you might feel that way?

The example you gave makes him sound defensive, as though he feels like he is being attacked and thus deflects. If you are causing this defensive reaction which is preventing conflict resolution, can you perhaps take a different approach that does not make him feel like he is under attack?"
askatherapist,fe5vnct,t3_entj5l,1578875963.0,"Most people begin to get interested in sex at the time of puberty but plenty of people get interested before puberty without any sort of abuse involved, myself included. Six is young for sexual interest to start but that isn't necessarily wrong or unhealthy on its own. Uncommon yes; wrong, no. As long as there wasn't some form of abuse at the time (which you indicate there wasn't), then I don't think there is cause for alarm only because of how young you were at the time.

The only thing that I'd see as problematic is the masturbation which you describe as a compulsion or something beyond your ability to control. But then again you say that you got it under control eventually on your own. Generally, any compulsive behavior can be problematic but then again you were on the cusp of puberty, a time where sexual interest often spikes which is normal.

So what I'm seeing is all behavior within normal limits, if admittedly close to those limits. Your use of certain terms like sexually deviant makes me wonder if you were raised in a conservative manner where maybe your parents saw these behaviors as sinful or shameful? 

Only you know the full circumstances of your life but I don't think your mind was 'infected' nor do I think you should be worried. You got interested in sex at a young age and figured out some fetishes as you went through puberty. Of course, talk to your therapist about this stuff as well. They will explain that the rape fantasy is also not uncommon. Heck do a search online of the term and it will come up a lot. 

Sexual behavior can be complicated but as long as you are doing stuff you are comfortable with and with consenting partners, there is nothing to be ashamed of."
askatherapist,fdrvl2i,t3_emw1lr,1578690350.0,"We are living in an era where people take very private details of our lives and make them public through social media and the breadcrumbs we leave online. I personally think that it is a paradigm that few (if any) legal systems address properly. Assuming you are being truthful when you say you didn't use any illegal means (not hacking systems or something for example) to get this information on your team then you probably don't have any kind of legal concerns but you do have some ethical ones. Cyberstalking is still stalking and you really crossed a line that shouldn't have been considered, much less performed. As they say, a bell cannot be un-rung. I have no idea if the people you engaged to -help you- will react positively or negatively to this but for your sake, I hope they are understanding and forgiving. The worst-case scenario is your team acting to remove you as a patient of theirs.

That said I hope you don't see that kind of outcome. I have to admit though I am curious on a couple of different things. One, why did you fixate on getting these people's personal information? I don't see how you could have thought that knowing this data could, in any way, help in your treatment. So, what was the goal you had in mind here when you were pursuing info about their lives like this?

Last thought is one of, I guess, morbid curiosity. This situation is part of the reason why I do my level best to avoid social media entirely. So I guess I am asking how did you manage to pierce their privacy so completely? You talk about 'doxing' as if it is something casual or routine, for you at least. How? Are you/were you a private investigator? Was this level of difficulty 'typical'?"
askatherapist,fdpxawk,t3_emkjrs,1578644428.0,"Psychopath is a pretty misunderstood term a lot of the time especially online. There is clearly a failure to attach 'personhood' to infants in your case but that seems to be more related to your younger age than anything. If you, for example, had a completely systemic lack of empathic attachment to other people (including adults, infants, and everything in between) then that could be a sign that there is some psychopathy issues.

So I guess the next question is, do you have this same issue with other people regardless of age or is it only infants?"
askatherapist,fdma5uu,t3_em3rab,1578543671.0,"Not everything you mention here is what I'd consider being problematic behavior in nature but to the degree you describe. Daydreaming, for example, is normally pretty harmless. All my life I've enjoyed making stories up in my mind like short stories all to myself that I'd expand on over the course of weeks, months, or years. But with me, those stories in my mind never interfere with social interactions. Further, your intentional verbal non-interaction with people around you does not sound healthy either; is it with only certain people or is that your default way of dealing with people day to day?

From the limited info, I can see I wonder if there is some kind of attachment disorder formed from when you would be left alone as a child for extended periods. Alternatively, there are signs of some form of panic disorder. Your strong introversion is prominent as well so does social interaction distress you? Or do you avoid interaction for some other reason? The social isolation makes me want to mention possible agoraphobia if, for example, you avoid leaving home in order to avoid interacting with other people.

I don't know why seeing a therapist is absolutely out of the question for you as I think it is pretty clear that you would benefit from talking to someone about your issues more in-depth. Psychological therapy is something that a lot of people are afraid of without proper reason and everybody deserves to live a life unhampered by abnormal behavioral patterns. It is a misconception to think that only people who have suffered acute trauma can benefit from behavioral therapy."
askatherapist,fdjk270,t1_fdjbd6q,1578474505.0,"I put the raised the idea of talking about this issue with her out there because I have no idea what your relationship with this girl is like other than what you've expressed here, which is that you clearly like her and don't want to put undue strain on what seems to be a promising relationship. This is why I put the qualifier about trust in the last message; only you have the whole picture here and are the only one who would have to live with the consequences for good or ill. Depending on who she is as a person, she may surprise you with her understanding of the situation if you were to level with her but that can only happen if you give her that chance. 

If talking is completely out of the question for you then that limits your options on dealing with this but that too is your choice to make.

As for my talking, well, I have always been very interested in human behavior. Some times, like your case, there are things we desperately want to talk about but so often there is nobody to whom we can easily turn for any number of reasons. Embarrassment, taboo, simple confusion, or something else keeping people from asking questions. I find that sad really, so I hope that if nothing else having a simple sounding board can help at least a little bit. :)"
askatherapist,fdja4h3,t1_fdj7zer,1578462930.0,"Intoxication can cause issues. Anxiety over past performance can cause issues. You feel more emotionally involved may be making it feel like the 'stakes' are higher with her now than your past relationships which would compound the already existing stress. 

It does paint a more complete picture of the situation. Chemistry got in the way the first time, while a combination of anxiety and stress caused issues the second time which is making you think there may be a more significant problem which is now adding fear for your next performance to the mix.

Anxiety, stress, and apprehension seem to be the core issue, so addressing these are likely to fix the problem. If she is being understanding you might consider letting her know what is going on in your head if you trust her. Impotence is not terribly uncommon so it is not out of the question that she might have experienced this in the past with others and may be able to help you address the stress and anxiety by helping you to relax. Another angle is that since you don't want her to misunderstand your impotence as a lack of interest in her or in sex in general. 

Not to pry but I do wonder what you mean by 'as supportive as I think she can be'. Does this mean full support or begrudging understanding? Hopefully the former."
askatherapist,fdj78x3,t3_elnx9m,1578460427.0,"Your situation can be caused by any number of things ranging from the biological to the psychological. Since you came here however I assume you have reason to assume something psychological is going on. Is there something different with this girl when you are intimate? Any fears or anxiety? Is she not doing something you want her to do, or is she doing something you do not want her to do, or is there something else significantly different from your past relationships where this wasn't a problem? How does she react? Is she supportive and understanding or does she see this negatively? 

Sex is complicated and there are a lot of factors that can affect intimacy. It is just a matter of figuring out which factor is troublesome for you here and does not deserve mockery."
askatherapist,fdj63x2,t1_fdh5c5o,1578459495.0,"For what it is worth, I've felt that pain as well. Sometimes people just grow apart or a relationship is just not invested in equally by both sides. It can be hard to find good friends, those who don't drift away or evaporate when things get difficult. But you are in an ideal environment to find new friends so don't lose hope."
askatherapist,fdh2c34,t3_el6osm,1578413866.0,"I'm not sure I have an accurate understanding of the situation (your first post description could be better or at least more clear, sorry), but I think I get the gist of it - people you thought you were close to are being unexpectedly distant. My first thought is that just because you share a dorm does not mean they are necessarily your friends. Perhaps they see you as just an acquaintance or some other status for you?"
askatherapist,fdf0tv8,t3_el0ij4,1578350755.0,"If it was me, I'd be at his home knocking until he answered the door however long that may take. Based on what you've said him being alone right now is not a good thing."
askatherapist,fdezoyg,t3_eky4o0,1578350043.0,Nonverbal does not mean he cannot communicate. Does he know ASL? Or if his hearing is fine then you can still ask for his forgiveness.
askatherapist,fdezeqt,t1_fdcl4ia,1578349864.0,"That is a pretty common element people with self harm talk about, the control. But that is still a poor coping mechanism. If you are still having periodic episodes of depression then you need to stick with a therapist and figure out a treatment plan. Becoming an adult is difficult but there are healthierself-harm ways to deal with those pressures."
askatherapist,fdcx3ju,t1_fdcr8bn,1578286866.0,There are some times when a fix is as simple as minimizing contact with an irritant. I hope this works for you.
askatherapist,fdcjipd,t1_fdchjdr,1578276456.0,"Yeah,  short of something catastrophic happening in her life that has prevented her from upholding her obligations with you, I would just plan on moving on."
