SkincareAddicts,fnzdo0s,t1_fnt7cr8,1587391984.0,"A chemical exfoliant doesn't have to be a peel, but if you do decide to use one, I recommend having a dermatologist or esthetician apply it. Chemical exfoliants can come in the form of several different products. I have a salicylic acid (BHA) cleanser, and a while back, tried the Burt's Bees acne treatment toner which also has salicylic acid in it. Not the best out there since it has alcohol in it, but definitely better than straight alcohol. There are also serums and masks that contain AHA's, BHA's, etc. It's really all about trying different products to see which one works best for your skin, which I know can be a pain. 

Take into consideration what skin type you have (normal, dry, combo, oily) and any skin conditions and concerns you want to treat (sensitivity, dark spots, wrinkles, acne) when choosing these products. 

Feel free to check out this link: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0grXSkUAvLY

As far as balancing the alcohol, yes, it is good that you use a moisturizer afterwards. If you have acne prone skin, rubbing alcohol can dry out the skin to the point where it starts to over produce sebum to compensate for the loss of moisture. Although I would reccomend cutting out this top altogether, if you choose to keep using it, make sure that you are using a really hydrating moisturizer. I'm not sure of the ingredient list in the cetaphil moisturizer, but I would check out the back and make sure that it has good moisture retaining ingredients.

The channel for the link I provided, Hyram, he also talks about good ingredients in a moisturizer in some of his other videos. I would check his channel out."
SkincareAddicts,fnrsct5,t1_fnjn2y3,1587199724.0,"I am begging you to not use this routine, or to at least make some adjustments.

1. A face towel is not getting all your makeup off. All that tugging and pulling on your face can stress your skin out, amd ultimately lead to wrinkles and fine lines.

-- Use a micellar water, oil based cleanser, or a makeup removing balm. Then go in with a water based cleanser. Be gentle. PAT YOUR FACE DRY.


2. That cleansing brush is abrasive, and you can get your face just as clean using your hands using the #60SecondRule. Physical exfoliants, like this one, I would not recommended for sensitive skin. You can achieve much better, and more gentle results using a chemical exfoliant. 


3. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T USE RUBBING ALCOHOL ON YOUR FACE. There's no need to ""get the excess"" if you are cleansing properly. If you still feel like you need that extra step, use a toner. And make sure it doesn't have denatured (SD) alcohol in it. Rubbing alcohol is harmfully drying and can do more harm than good. Especially bad if you have acne prone skin. 


4. I use curology and my acne has cleared up a lot. If acne is still a concern. If you want to remove hyperpigmentation and/or acne scars, I recommend niacinamide, and chemical exfoliants like AHA/BHA. If you choose to exfoliate chemically, please use a sunscreen protectant of at least SPF 30

Not hating. Only here to help"
Skincare_Addiction,fnrqpif,t1_fnrqlcu,1587197990.0,Niacinamide is also a great ingredient for clearing up hyperpigmentation and/or acne scars. The Ordinary's  Niacinamide and Zinc 2% serum.
Skincare_Addiction,fnrqlcu,t3_g3awm5,1587197872.0,"For being 47, your skin looks great. No noticable wrinkles or severe skin damage, which is always great. 

** I tried to make these recommendations as affordable, but effective as possible.**


â€¢A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin. If your face feels tight after washing your face, that face wash is too harsh for you. For more combo/oily skin, Youth to the People's Kale and Green Tea Spinach cleanser. For all skin types, the Simple gel wash, or the CeraVe gentle face wash.

â€¢I reccomend using a retinol/retinoid, as 
mentioned above, at night. The Inkey List has one that I've heard good feedback about.

â€¢Also, as aforementioned above, a chemical exfoliant every other day. I haven't used it personally (yet), but I have heard great things about Paula's choice BHA exfoliator. If you are new to skin care, or have more sensitive skin, I would reccomend The Inkey List's glycolic acid treatment. *

* note that if you are going to use a chemical exfoliant that you MUST use a sunscreen every day, because your skin is now in a more compromised state which makes the risk of sun damage higher. 

â€¢ moisturizer!!! choose a moisturizer that is suitable for your skin type (dry, combo, oily, normal). This is important in choosing products that work best for you. To find out what skin type you have, check out this YouTube video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vic-EMOivpA 

â€¢Sunscreen of at least spf 30 during the day. UV rays break down collagen in the dermis, which leads to rapid aging. If you already use one, great. Brands will try to trick you into buying a sunscreen of spf 110 or something. But the highest spf protection you can get is spf 50. **

** Look for a sunscreen with zinc oxide in the ingredient list, because this ingredient doesn't bleach and destroy the coral reefs. Protect the wonderful world so that it may one day be wonderful again. <3"

The nurse was very unprofessional with the way she handled this visit. I would firmly address your concerns and distress that the nurse has caused to someone of a higher status at the hospital. It would also help if your remember or have paperwork stating the nurse's name. 

I understand that children can struggle to stay still when they are getting a needle injected into their skin, but there is no reason why any mark (besides the needle puncture) should be left on a child, or anyone for that matter, when they leave a health clinic. I would consider this unnecessary force, especially because you were already trying to calm your daughter down.

You should talk with your daughter to make sure that she still posseses trust within a healthcare provider or doctor. Try explaining to her that nurses and doctors are not allowed to treat others that way.

As for your husband, you should explain to him why this incident troubles you.
