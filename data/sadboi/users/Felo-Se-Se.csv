DegradingHoles,fqni2t4,t3_elz03x,1589495237.0,"I'd use you like the little cumslut whore you are, smacking your ass, pulling your hair, fucking you so hard that'd he'd have to come check out what's causing all the noise. Door would be locked though, he should know it's rude to interrupt a guest when they're balls deep in his wife. He has to wait his turn. I'd leave your pussy dripping with my cum, but I'm not done with you yet. I'd smack you in the face with my dick until it got hard again. Then I'd shove it down your throat. All your hubby can do is wait and listen as you gag on my cock. He would knock on the door ""c'mon, you already came once and now her pussy is ready for me, can I please come in now?"" But I'd tell him to wait until I'm finished, I want his whore of a wife to know what it feels like to have a real man inside her for a change. Once I'm done fucking your face and ready to cum again, I'll start pounding your ass deep and hard until I fill you with cum, leaving you leaking from both holes. THEN I open the door and let him have his treat. After all, he waited patiently for it."

You bring up points of feeling like you mold your personality to match the personalities of those around you and also how you want to do everything you can to help others but feel overwhelmed, to me that sounds like people pleasing which I struggle with. If you think you might be a people pleaser, do a couple quick google searches to identify if you are or if you are something else and try to see how you can better manage your time and make yourself a priority when it's needed, because when it comes to mental health, it's definitely needed more than you might realize."

loneliness,f69uvai,t1_f6842ec,1572747829.0,"So I completely relate to not being able to find any meaningful connections with others, but I often have found that perspective can play a big part. Stop viewing others as ""enemies"" but rather as potential connections. Open up when you feel like it's been enough time to appropriately do so. You might find that they do too. Don't force it though. 

When you say

 >just wanna be rude and care for my own boundaries.

Be mindful that other people are receptive to this behaviour and you may be pushing others away which ruins any chance of a connection later in the relationship. 

Not sure if this helps you, but good luck either way."
