just quit, you can either say you’re resigning officially that day (which what I was planning on doing) or you can just never show up. If the job is toxic and you can handle yourself financially until you find something then quit. I’m in the same boat as you and I’m crying almost every day. The only reason I haven’t quit is because of rent.

P.s I’m an office assistant too, there’s no room for growth in that specific career so gtfo being an assistant sucks and find something better.

Anxiety,fp3aw04,t3_gawxzq,1588276121.0,"I don’t think people are tired of being locked in. I think people are tired of being broke. In my state, $1200 only covers rent. So let’s say you’re out of a job because you got laid off, how would you pay your bills, the food you eat, the utilities? How? Some people applied for unemployment when this all started and are STILL waiting for a response.

The virus isn’t gonna go away if we all decided to stay home, that’s unrealistic as hell. The virus isn’t going to eradicate itself out of nowhere. This is all gonna slow down when a vaccine is available to prevent spread but it will probably be added to a long list of contagious diseases that will probably be around for the rest of humanity. So it’s either wait for a vaccine to come, possibly lose everything you have or maybe/maybe not get sick. Both options suck ass, but unfortunately nothing else is being done to assist us financially, so we are forced to go back to work and if nothing is open how would we do that? 

I think partially re-opening with certain restrictions is a good idea, and it will be a test as to what we can expect in the next couple of months. No matter what is going to happen, we won’t win. It’s all up to time to see what’ll happen next."
LifeProTips,foqiw3h,t3_g8xje9,1587994588.0,"my boyfriend (who actually has a dash camera business) got into a car accident about 2 or 3 years ago. A lady had road rage, tried cutting him off and hit his car. She sped off and he had everything on his dash camera. He called his insurance company, sent his video and his claim got resolved in a matter of days (thankfully with the vehicle and license plate identified, they found out she had the same insurance company as him). If he would’ve never had his camera he would’ve still had a fucked up fender and wouldve never been able to locate the lady who sped off.

She probably had 10+ people who have worked under her who have all quit.

I considered adopting a pet for emotional support, because I knew apart from me, he needed someone or something to help occupy his mind space, and to give him lots of motivation to push through. So, I walked into a PetSmart with him one day, to see if they had an adoption center. Walked towards the center and I see my little guy (4 months old) scratching at the plastic window in front of him begging for our attention. He was adorable, so tiny and so excited to interact. Now, mind you I never liked cats but my boyfriend did so I decided to suck it up and ask if I could see the cat. Oh man, I fell in love, the little rascal was running everywhere, playing with everything and seems so happy to be free. I looked at my boyfriend and I told him “we have to take him, I’m not leaving without him”.

So fast forward a couple hours, we had to go to the bank to take cash out for the adoption fee, and go to Walmart to buy kitty stuff; when we went back to the PetSmart (literally 20 minutes before closing) the guy said he almost gave away our kitty to someone else, because he thought like many others that we would just not come back. But, he said for some reason he held him for us. Now, here we are two years later with the most precious, playful, and lovable cat ever. We got him at a time we both needed him, and I think he needed us too....I can’t picture my life without him & to this day, I know he was meant for us."

This is not going to end whether we stay home or we don’t stay home, period. It’s going to keep spreading until some solution comes about to either eradicate it or prevent others from catching it.

Phillip is not my sole reason of living but he is probably one of the main reasons I don’t go absolutely crazy...when life gets hard or I’m having a panic attack, he’s right there. Maybe he doesn’t understand the concept of love, but to me he knows when I’m not doing okay, and he never leaves my side, and I think that speaks for itself. & for those who ask, I am doing fine for now..some days are extremely difficult to even get up from bed because my disorders do mess me up...but I’m alive and will keep fighting to inspire those like me...and let them know that YES, we can keep pushing. Growing up, I was too poor to own an animal, so Phillip is my first ever pet I’ve owned...and I am absolutely grateful to have such a peaceful cat. If Phillip was a human, I’m sure he’d be that guy everyone loves to be around because he’s just too chill haha. Although Phillip isn’t considered a cure or medication, he is to me...makes life a lot whole colorful. He makes me laugh whenever he does something crazy, smile when he does something cute, and feel immense love when he’s near me. Growing up, I never even thought I was deserving of love, thought my own family was against me at one point. But I’ve kept going, and with hobbies, Phillip, and therapy I’ve learned how to manage quite a bit, although it’s been a huge struggle.

Most of the time I see people wandering around or wondering what they’ll work on next — which can get demotivating. These lists help me have a goal and keep me focused. 
7. Have fun! The gym can be super annoying but when your clothes start fitting right, people start taking notice (including yourself), and you start feeling fantastic....it’ll be worth it"

work,fb6hag6,t3_eboile,1576550261.0,"I work for a micromanager. Had to ask for a transfer a couple of weeks ago. Welp, I had 4 panic attacks in the span of 4 months and I spoke up when I had the last one. I couldn’t do it with the unnecessary bugging, the incessant e-mails, the constant following up...and the best part making me feel invaluable and untrustworthy as an employee (even though I’m one of the firm’s best employees) it drove me to a point where I thought to myself “well if I don’t do ANYTHING right for her, then fuck it I’m done”. It didn’t matter how many e-mails I responded to, what lists I made, how earlier I came to work to catch up, or how many lunches I missed, it was NEVER enough. 

So no I don’t think micro managing is a good thing. I work best when my boss 100% trusts me and if I fuck up then I take 100% blame for it, and come up with a solution and how no to do it again. But working for a micromanager is definitely like being in a relationship with someone that has 0 trust in you. Can definitely drive you crazy. Thankfully, my transfer has been approved and I won’t be seeing her any longer (soon)."
AskReddit,f8tahlj,t3_e1we7p,1574799306.0,"My boyfriend’s mom passed away almost three years ago, and he has become increasingly dependent on me (I’ve enabled him, that I can admit) but now that my love isn’t there, I’ve tried weaning him off, and allowing him to be more independent, but it doesn’t work. So I’m scared that if I leave he’ll become homeless and more depressed (and possibly hurt himself). Being with him also benefits me from going back to my mom’s house (which is far now from where I work, and where my life is) and since he helps me with rent, I’ve stayed. Rent is expensive as hell in the city I live in, and with my massive student debt, I can’t afford to move out completely alone unless it’s in a room...so there’s that. But I know eventually, one of us has to give in and leave because there’s no way a relationship can survive without love.   

But he knows this, I’ve always been honest with him. I refuse to live a lie with someone. He’s aware, but never really does anything about it so I guess you can say he’s in this for beneficial reasons as well. 

Piece of advice: wait until you’re married to move in and don’t move in young. Having a live in relationship sucks, you’re not really committed 100% to stay, but at the point you have a life together, so to rebuild after that can be a pain in the ass.

work,exl61ci,t3_cthppo,1566406662.0,"College to me is a big money making scheme. I graduated with a BA in psychology worth 20,000 and work in a career that pays me better than working at a psych office. Ofc I could’ve gone to get my PHD but I wasn’t about to blow 100k+ to be a psychologist making 60-70k (average salary in my area). After research, the high paying psychologists are ones who have their own practices or have been in the field for many years.

I was close to getting into 40k debt for a Masters in HR this fall, and I decided not to go as I thought that was too expensive for a field that values experience more than a degree and I just didn’t have the HR experience at all, and I knew I would end up working entry level somewhere making 30k (again, average salary in my city). 

I regret going to school for what I believe is the wrong thing. I do believe if you want to be in the technology or medical field, I 100% believe it’s worth it, because the guarantee of getting a high paying job after you graduate is much higher, because those jobs are higher in demand.

My suggestion is don’t go to school for a degree in a field that has low demand, because you will either A) end up working a crappy paying job with mounting student debt B) end up having to go back to school for a ‘better’ opportunity to make more money resulting in more debt C) work somewhere unrelated to a field for the money or D) start your own business 

Just because you have a degree, doesn’t mean anything nor does it make your better than anyone else. I know a guy who graduated with a BA in Criminal Justice, and a Masters in Public Administration with mounting debt..want to know what he does now? He’s a probation officer. Something he could’ve easily accomplished with just a BA, but people think that because you have a higher  degree, you’re worth much more. When in reality, it’s so easy nowadays to pass college with technology. I’ve met recent law grads that are absolute idiots and makes me wonder HOW?! 

But anyways, college is an absolute choice not a requirement. Whatever goal you have set in mind, go for it. The smartest and most successful people I know don’t have college degrees. Just gotta work harder than those who do."
