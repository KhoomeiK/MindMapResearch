dating_advice,fjfbqnx,t3_fcttgv,1583288477.0,Phone calls! I'm not a texter either. I'm slow and hate taking hours to have a convo that could be had in 20 minutes. Not only that but calls can be shorter yet more satisfying in the long run. You can do it on your commutes or while folding laundry.
dating_advice,fjfbi4u,t3_fd1vhk,1583288338.0,I like to ask deal breaker questions right away on the first date. I'm in my 30s so maybe thats why. I like to ask about habits like if they're into gaming and if so what games to get a feel for how much they play or a good one is also is to ask what is the worst date they have been on. That's always a fun one but definitely dissect the response in your head this can be a tell all about the person.
dating_advice,fjfay2f,t3_fd22jq,1583288012.0,Right away. It doesn't mean the answer you get will be totally honest but for the most part most they will be.
popping,fitit6x,t3_e5gpi9,1582721368.0,"After years.... and I mean years I finally saw a doctor about these. I got them pretty frequently some hurt, some didnt but after weightloss I can see all the little scars now. I got a major one on my bum and my doctor said it was staph and that some people are more prone to it, in my case rubbing thighs and skin breakage. She gave me some cream to put on when they would come up. The one on my bum went down in 2 days. I'd see a doctor."
WeightLossAdvice,evazk9f,t3_ciy4oc,1564361655.0,"Focus on non scale victories. If you're able to get a physical, focus on improving your stats. Focus on drinking more water, improving your sleep patterns, improving your energy levels. Improve your diet little by little. Cut the easy stuff like oils, butters, and the fast food. Focus on those things. I got a Fitbit and it let me focus on steps, bpm, etc. And kept me off the scale.  You cant obsess over the weight for a while. Take pictures and take notes. Try a 80/20 diet rather than taking cheat days or entire cheat meals. Remember the first 10 to 15 lbs are the easy to drop but the hardest to keep off. It took me a year to drop 30 lbs but I never got on the scale until after 25lbs lost. I'd done a major weightloss before so this 2nd one felt almost impossible. I'd lose 10, and gain 15 because I'd ""reward"" myself. Dont do that. Lol. Fine healthy ways to reward yourself. Banana nice cream instead of ice cream or an iced coffee instead of a frappuccino. Good luck!"
WeightLossAdvice,eu6l4tc,t3_cetu0l,1563502797.0,More plant based foods. Cut oils and dairy. Bulk out with the veggies.
Periods,eth5gm3,t3_cblbs6,1562806487.0,"Could be endo... 
It could be a hormonal imbalance....
You wont get answers without seeing a doctor. One thing you could try is limiting other hormonal exposures. Such as dairy, soy, and limiting your meat intake. Diet drinks and sweetners too. It will take time to know if that helps anything but if seeing a dr isnt possible start there. That helped balance me out immensely when I was getting migraines and back pain that had me in a fetal position for an entire day each month."

WeightLossAdvice,errqpb3,t3_c313ur,1561179555.0,"I'm going to sound like a broken record on this community... but check out the WFPB diet. I lost 35lbs in two years with no excercise because I physically could not, my back and knees hurt every day. I didn't even get on a scale until someone started asking if I had lost weight, by that point I had already lost 23lbs. You eat until you're full. No counting calories or portion control. You just follow the rules which are logical. It's a natural and biological approach to food. Its changed my life. I was really depressed and my social anxiety got out of control. I had to do something. Its changed everything. Check it out. Look up forks over knives, watch YouTube videos like the channel Ellen Fisher, #wfpb on Instagram. I did this for months before I started to be sure it was for me. I start at 50% WFPB and the transitioned to 100%. I still have ""regular"" food but only like once a month and if I eat out I try to only break one rule."
WeightLossAdvice,errq87l,t3_c319b0,1561179041.0,"Dont! Lol. 
Look up WFPB. It sounds restrictive but it's really not. No counting. No portion control. No excercise...although recommended. I lost 35lbs in less than 2 years, no excercise just normal errands. I'm never hungry. You just cant be a picky eater. Just look into it. It's not for everyone. I researched both keto and WFPB, but mentally keto was too restrictive because of how much measuring and counting is involved and I'm too busy for that. WFPB only requires me to fill a grocery bag in the mornings with produce when I'm running late."
WeightLossAdvice,errpkbq,t3_c3asug,1561178320.0,You should probably log your meals in cronometer make sure you're not too deficient. Your body could be asking for some additional fat or protein.
WeightLossAdvice,errpb08,t3_c3hvmh,1561178044.0,You're probably overdoing the protien. Cut back a little in each meal and bulk it out with some more veggies which I'm sure you're having as side. I'd also replace one of your proteins with a plant based protien. The water and fiber help with digestion and can help with the bloat.
WeightLossAdvice,erroylb,t3_c3c7of,1561177685.0,"It's a slow process!! Its taken me 2 years to lose 30 lbs on diet alone! You'll get there! The only motivation I had this time was my health. I gave away my scale and did not measure myself until someone asked if I had lost weight. Then, and only then did I start measuring. You'll drive yourself crazy! This is my 2nd time losing weight, about 30 lbs too. The first time I was in high school and it was completely unhealthily. I was obsessed with calories, the scale, and my clothing sizes. This time it was all about the non scale victories. Like improving my resting BPM on my Fitbit or meeting nutritional goals on cronometer.  Getting my blood pressure under control!! That's what I focused on. I did a WFPB lifestyle change which focuses on nutrition, not calories or portions.  It's going to take time, but you will get there!"
WeightLossAdvice,erro5ne,t3_c3ib53,1561176866.0,"From 180 lbs in 8th grade to an unhealthy weightloss in high school and active weightloss in college I managed to stay in the range of a 145 to 160lbs. In 2013 I started to really gain weight on after a losing battle with depression. I got up to 199 lbs. It was debilitating. I started having back pain, knee pain, I was more depressed, and started having really bad social anxiety. I think it was so bad because I had already been overweight and managed to lose the weight and generally keep it off for years because it was the only thing that gave self confidence. All of a sudden I had no self control or motivation and I packed on all the weight.  I think it's harder the 2nd time around because you already know how hard it is to lose the weight. You've already done it once.... and now you have to do it again?? The only thing that helped me lose 35 lbs was a WFPB diet with no access to a scale or measuring tape. I researched and watched videos for months before starting. The biggest motivator for me was getting my blood pressure under control and the fact that I didnt have to do any kind of portion controlling or excercise. Mentally I needed it to be simple. I'll have my 2 year anniversary in August. I lost 23 lbs by the time I finally got on a scale. I got to 30lbs this April. I'm on track to my last 10lbs. I just started exercising a few weeks ago. I'm still dealing with the social anxiety. I haven't dated in 5 years. It's really hard. You just have to do it slowly this time. Be realistic about the timeline and find a different motivation this time around."
depression,erp3fy9,t1_ermecak,1561098025.0,"*your mom is my mom* but my mom didnt give me that scenario. They just feel like if they think you had it better than them then you should be happy and that depression is only sadness. They dont understand that your persceptives will never align. Your worst is YOUR worst. My worst is MY worst. You are entitled to feel miserable about YOUR worst. This is exactly why my mom couldnt understand my depression. She divorced my dad when I was 24, only then was she was able to get a better perceptive about how much emotional and verbal abuse we endured as a family because of a cultural view on divorce, but she still doesnt get it 100%. Weve only recently started talking about my depression, I'm 30 now.  This is 4 years after i moved out and all I can get is an acknowledgment, like I'm so glad your not depressed anymore (which isnt true, its just manageable now). Before when I was having a breakdown she would just start telling me about how much worse her abuse was as a child and with my dad, like it was supposed to make me feel better. I'm not saying her tragedies shouldnt be validated nor that they aren't worse but that's why depression is an illness... It doesnt change the fact that your miserable and dwelling on everything negative.
Your depression is real. . Your trauma is 100% real. You're feelings are valid. Your anxiety is not just stress and nerves. You're not lazy... your mind is just really busy feeling everything, overthinking, and trying to keep you from falling apart."
depression,erp070c,t1_ermuz1h,1561094396.0,"If depression has taught me anything it is that perception is like a fingerprint. Your worst day IS YOUR WORST day. It's the one positive I've gotten from depression. If you tell me your angry and upset because you burned your grill cheese and now you have anxiety about cooking... then yes, that is terrible and I'm sorry you're feeling that way. I'm no one to sit there and one up you or tell you that you have no right to feel that way. Your mind, your emotions, and your perception all I should do is try empathize."

It's probably not ideal with having just finished law school but if you can manage to get any job to support you long enough to get you in a better environment you're going to manage your mental health so much better. I honestly didnt care what job I had to get when I realized it was my only way to feel better. I took a CSR job at an insurance office and within 8 weeks I found a roommate and put a deposit on an apartment. It was like a life raft. I held on for dear life. My family didnt know I was moving until the week I was moving my stuff out.

It's truly the worst.
It will get better. It's hard, but you'll be able to see beyond it sooner or later. It wont be forgotten by any means and your heart will still ache sometimes but the sadness wont be as overwhelming."
depression,erlk4ki,t3_c2fuf3,1560989330.0,"Agreed. Unless they've been through it's hard for them to understand where you're going through. My dad was an alcoholic and abusive. My mom endured it all for ""our"" sake. We all have ""daddy issues"". I've always had anxiety, but depression didnt really affect me until my twenties. I was living with my mom after college and she just figured I was just having a rough time finding a job... I didnt know how to tell her what I was feeling because I was still in denial myself. Living in that bedroom and not wanting to disappoint her and struggling to stay functional was so terribly wearing. They're would be days I'd cry out of nowhere and my mom would just stare at me silently until I composed myself. I didn't begin to get better until I managed to get a full time job and move out. You dont want to point the finger or disappoint them. You also can't continue falling deeper into hole trying to hide. If you're in a position to seek treatment do it. If you're not just be upfront and tell them the truth and that you're asking them to help you seek help. I wish I would have done that sooner. My mom doesnt like talking about it but she acknowledges it and that's good enough for."

I really feel like it's definitely going to be your major illness and diet. I'm sure your body will regulate eventually, so long as your eating enough. 
I know my periods were super painful and heavy when I was between 175 to 195lbs for a few years and over the last couple of years I lost 35 lbs and my periods have been less painful and a hair lighter. I recently started exercising daily and my body decided I needed to have a weird light period for 5 days. Everything is pointing at either diet and excercise or fibroids. My normally scheduled period is usually the 18th to 21st of the month. Needless to say im going to be real upset if I have my regularly scheduled period. Lol."

Periods,erdktql,t3_bywerj,1560745543.0,My experience has been that diet makes a difference.
