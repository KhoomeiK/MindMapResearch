Sorry I'm so used to people on reddit being absolute fucking psychos and I really don't even come on here anymore because it's so fucked, so I got sort of defensive with the us vs them. I can't argue that though, it was too late to control after a certain amount of time. The thing is out of every country in the world is there really any that actually contained it successfully or not botch the beginning (except New Zealand I hear, I could be wrong on that ngl)? I know people aren't living in those countries so there's no point in really saying anything, which I understand but I think out of all the 1st world countries pretty much 98 percent of them fumbled the beginning (along with the media for 2 full months), so it's just hypercritical at the very least to not also include THE REST OF THE WORLD in fumbling the beginning. I just can't see how some are saying the United States botched the response on EVERY single thing, it's really disingenuous. Nice to see someone not go absolutely bad shit insane when mentioning Trumps name without talking shit, though.

Methadone,fo9xq29,t1_fo9fgfr,1587634320.0,"Eh, it all depends on how long and your body how your taper goes. Anecdotes incoming so take it with a grain of salt.

I got off methadone doing a 1 mg taper over 70 weeks to get off of 60ngs, I personally got off really easy, there was some stumbles and uneasiness at the end but I managed to jump off of 1mg 3+ years ago and never looked back.

Someone I know got down to 15mg from 90-100mg an couldnt do it when they tried to go down further to 14mg or so and they went practically the same speed as me maybe a little faster. I actually talked to someone who knows the person and 3 years later they are still at the clinic and at a high dose,  atleast at the time i spoke to this person. 

Anyways. I wrote all of that bc methadone is hit or miss, I've read ppl jump off of 1mg and never feel terrible wd and others who are fucked up for like 6 months... so you just dont know how your body responds to the taper until you do it. The method to success is slow an steady, I bet theres a good portion who have tried to taper an failed here, and im not trying to judge or anything, its just for some ppl really hard to drop and for whatever reason they get the shit end of the stick an go into horrible withdrawal for months lol. 

These are all things you need to weigh. Is long term pain care worth that risk? Some would say yes, others no. Good luck."

In the beginning I would be in the mirror with the flashlight on trying to see if there was any growth, it's toxic. I compare it to people who are trying to lose weight and are constantly on the scale, bad bad bad. Just apply it and forget about it, eventually the gains will come.

I think it's weird to say but it might be the better of two evils to just keep it legal. There's good evidence that legalizing everything will cut crime in half (Portugal did it) and Im honestly starting to believe it, but that will never happen in the US not for a long time idt."

I feel for you dude, I went out to the bar a week ago and after like a year of not having a smoke I told my friend to let me hit his and I regreted it instantly it was so fucking nasty and it was the cigarette I smoked for 8 years prior to quitting, so that says a lot. The only tobacco flavor I have experience with is the virginia tobacco flavor that Juul had, it wasnt that bad in my opinion but it's certainly not something I would like to be compelled to choose as the only alternative to cigarettes."

But to be honest, I don't see why it would cause any sort of problems with sperm quality, I haven't seen a study on it and I assume after the multiple decades it's been on the market and FDA approved something like that would probably have been looked into since it's one of the only treatments for alopecia areata and so widely used by men. I could be wrong though, because what do I know.

Maybe supplementing for a few days could help? 

> Supplements such as CoQ10 and alpha-tocopherol significantly improve sperm count. Also, carnitine has positive effects on sperm motility and morphology. Simultaneous administration of vitamin E and vitamin C reduces the sperm DNA damage.

My hairline has filled in a lot over the past almost 8 months. I already have had thick hair my whole life but had a bit of a widows peak, which I still have but it just looks different to me, dunno. I really would need to put a bfore an after pic side by side to really assess if what I am seeing is true or not. I never seen hair on my scalp shed btw, just facial hair."

TrueOffMyChest,fcjuzy0,t1_fcjr80t,1577706065.0,"I tapered from methadone over like 65 weeks from 60mg to 1mg  going down 1mg every monday, I'm not too entirely familiar with suboxone but I know it's kind of similar that it's a maintenance drug. Just take it slow and steady... the thing I liked about methadone is that I could taper my dose 1mg every week, that 1mg decrease was so small most of the time I hardly noticed it until my daily dose was only 4 or 5mgs, so even when I was decreasing it by 1mg it was still going down fucking 20+ percent of the dose.

 I was pretty lucky when it came to methadone as I got off of it with practically no withdrawal (diarrhea and sleep issues for about 2 weeks) but compared to what I hear people going through it was a cake walk (and also compared to coming off heroin and xanax cold turkey in a fucking jail cell for 20 days with practically no ability to hold food down or sleep) . People seem to try to get off of it much too fast and I think that's why it's got such a bad wrap... I'm assuming that's the same with bupe that coming off it to fast is what causes people to fuck up.  

I'm gonna link you a channel on Youtube that I've found to be really good and it is run by two guys, one tapered off methadone successfully and the other tapered off subs successfully... here's the guy who tapered off subs and how he did it practically with no withdrawal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXYZgeDaMqE

The one who tapered off methadone did it the same way I did so they give really good advice. Wish I had the video a few years back it would've helped me tremendously because I too had anxiety from not having that safety net MMT provided. Good luck, if I could do it im pretty sure you can do it too lol.

Tbh, a lot of the pain you will feel is 90 percent psychosomatic and 10 percent the drug. Your brain plays tricks on you, try not to get stuck in the loop thinking about how you are going down. Just do it and forget its even happening.  Eventually you are taking your last dose and you'll be ready. At least that's how it went for me, I stopped getting hooked up on all the terror horror stories and instead started to read only positive success stories. Had a good support system and I was just honestly 100 percent fucking ready to stop being dependent on drugs to live and function, which I was hardly doing but u know what i mean

Sorry for the long post, Im pretty passionate about helping ppl get off that shit"
