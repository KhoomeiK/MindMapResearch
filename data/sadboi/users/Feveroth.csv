I have headphones and am going to start using them to listen to chilled out music and/or other chilled out things (ASMR, audiobooks etc)."

I'm gonna actually give ASMR a go depending on if I can find a suitable one, and try to sort out my sleeping habits. At 27 it's probably not healthy to be having the habits I do. 

Thanks for your input though, its genuinely appreciated!"

AmItheAsshole,fln9wva,t1_fln9ipu,1585313522.0,"I mean, that's only assuming I dont have sleeping problems, regardless of whether or not I was in bed or watching Netflix I would've been up to at least 5, and since she woke up at 9, I would've woken up too, and been grouchy all day.

I'm not arguing I just dont think I conveyed properly the extent of my sleep problems."
AmItheAsshole,fln8mxr,t1_fln87fd,1585312510.0,"Well the idea was that when she woke up I'd come and be with her from that point on, I get the idea of her waking up with me, but I figured already being awake was better than sleeping the day away, when it is her birthday. 

The argument wasnt super intense, our arguments never are, but I think it's the fact we argued that has really made the day feel crappier than ever intended. 

And to clear it up; I'm just a generally grumpy person as a whole tbh, I dont know how she puts up with me in the first place haha, and (like I've said in a previous comment) I'll probably end up being up until 10/11ish tonight, but have been known to stay up to around 1am. Hooray mild insomnia!"
AmItheAsshole,fln7t7y,t1_fln7niq,1585311825.0,"Ah fair enough haha.

Yeah perhaps you're right, I'm sure we will speak about it soon enough, properly."
AmItheAsshole,fln6h1f,t1_fln68mz,1585310659.0,"I'm unfamiliar with that acronym, sorry.

To clear it up, I'm pretty used to staying up of a night time (as I said I have trouble sleeping anyway), and can generally power through with the aid of coffee to around 10/11pm.
