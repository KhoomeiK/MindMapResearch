BPD,fkgk53n,t3_fi7uu5,1584162365.0,I’m quite the opposite... I’ve slowly been pushing all my friends away.. I might receive the odd text to go drinking but I usually decline because I’m a bit of a mess. I’m at the age too now where my friends are getting married. I hate weddings and am dreading these social obligations. Unsure if I can even face the Stag do... these are people I’ve known for 20ish years !! I’m crazy !
BPD,fkgjde2,t3_fi06qa,1584161630.0,"Same.. been doing it for a good 8-9 years now... I smoke ‘poppers’... a method of smoking tobacco and weed in a bong, and they are like crack.... terrible for your lungs. I have had extended breaks though... quit for a year or so, and might have a week or a month off if I can. But it’s mainly been most of the day, everyday for nearly a decade. I’m sure it makes things worse."
AnxietyDepression,fi0h40f,t3_f5r1rr,1582036842.0,Wow I can totally relate to this. I have skills though but I barely put them to use as I can’t find the will most of the time.
socialskills,fhvvi05,t3_f4vqw4,1581901846.0,I do too... but I’m a 30 year old guy. I’m too self conscious and it’s awful.
depressed,fhuq58b,t1_fhu5arh,1581888979.0,"Here where I live, it doesn’t cost any extra.. or some places charge like £3.50.

But I agree with the person below me, use the need to shop as a tool to get out and change your headspace if you can."
depression,fhu1kpq,t3_f4v5ke,1581880757.0,"You will just pass all that pain and misery you are feeling onto your family... your kids will never be the same, and even in old age, there wouldn’t be a day they wouldn’t think about your passing. Try everything to find that light in life, but suicide is the worst answer, particularly if you have a wife and children. That will just mess them all up for the rest of their lives, and I’m sure you wouldn’t want that, despite the pain you are currently feeling. CBT should help if you haven’t tried already."
depressed,fhu0nrc,t3_f4v8rr,1581880481.0,I tend to get my shopping delivered to my door :)
depressed,fhu0jlb,t3_f4tuup,1581880434.0,"That is the worst feeling isn’t it? Where you’re somewhere great with people you love and they love you, but the empty sadness persists. I’ve been there many times, and it usually takes me a couple of months to recover."
depression,fht1l2n,t3_f4rmcl,1581868757.0,"Hah, I’m quite the same. I know what steps I have to take to better myself, but I can’t find the will to take action. I too am close to breaking point so I think I’m going to start with small steps. I suggest you do too. Listen to podcasts/YouTube videos... go for daily walks, slowly cut down on the trash you are putting in your body. Seek help. Write down a plan of action and slowly chip away at each problem.

Until you have tried everything to better yourself and improve your mental state, then look for alternatives. But we need to try. Also this dark cloud won’t last forever, even if it feels like it will."
depression,fhsyzv1,t3_f4q54y,1581867588.0,"This dark pit may seem like it’ll last forever, but it won’t. If there is a chance for 1 happy day, then it’s not worth it. It might take some time but eventually you’ll find friends and a purpose in life.

I’m very sorry to hear you’re so low. Definitely seek help if you haven’t already."
lonely,fhsxpze,t3_f4o05y,1581867021.0,"This is pure social anxiety. I used to suffer from it the way you describe, and certainly still do a lot of times... to the point where my paranoia has led me to unnecessary confrontations and I haven’t seemed to be able to recover.

I think I will get help. I suggest you do too."
depression,fhsftnn,t1_fhrss5i,1581860204.0,"I got put in a couple of of group projects, and made friends that way...I still keep in touch now and again, although I pushed them away because of my anxiety and depression.
I also made some friends through my housemates although they weren’t particularly my type. But we got on well.
Also I knew someone from my school at a close-by uni and he had some cool housemates... we started hanging out a lot in my second year.
Shame as I was really social during the last two years, but after leaving 6-7 years ago, I have regressed quite badly."
depression,fhrgybr,t1_fhrf5q1,1581825967.0,"That does sound truly awful. Can you get any benefits from the government/state? The father will have to pay child support until your son is 18, no?

Your son is of course full priority, and I can only imagine the weight of responsibility you feel... this alone would warrant any self sacrifice or motivation. I have no idea what it’s like to have a child, though.

My mother went though a divorce when I was eight, and amazingly worked a full time job all up until I moved out 20 years later ! I  truly admire her for her strength. I’m certain she was depressed for a lot of it... I love her so much, and feel pathetic to make her worry about me with my depression/anxiety. 

I believe you too can persevere !! I wish you luck.. the divorce won’t be pleasant, but I hope you find the motivation and light in life - even if it’s not constant - but enough for you to enjoy and support yourself and your son for as long as needed. Therapy and medication are always options, although I see you’re from the states so is probably not economical.
Edit: just saw you’ve been on medication and had therapy."
depression,fhrc3ov,t3_f4keg8,1581822522.0,"Sounds like you’ve realised moving out is step one. If you are desperate, try working retail or deliver food... unsure if you have deliveroo and ubereats in the states. Pretty lucky to be able to cam though. Also can’t your boyfriend support himself ??

I know you are in a dark place right now, but realise you’re not a failure, and you’re still super young! Hopefully with a bit of work, you and your boyfriend can pull enough money and rent a small place for yourselves. Independence might make you happier."
depression,fhr8usx,t3_f4j9k8,1581820213.0,"Yes I did that for my first year of university. I gradually made friends and enjoyed the later two years, and that started a pretty bad addiction to pot.

My first year of university was a lot of isolation, gaming, sleeping, and long showers."
depression,fhr4mjm,t3_f4iwhc,1581817238.0,"Wow I totally relate... especially about replaying the social events in my head and spiralling. Thing is, I feel like alcohol is essential for me to socialise. I need to be under the influence of something.

I drank last night and it took me to new depths... alcohol usually made me confident and happy."
depression,fhr2iny,t3_f4fcm0,1581815655.0,"I can’t imagine how people function. I depend on alcohol to socialise. I am lucky enough to work from home, but even then I do the bare minimum, and the income is unstable.

There’s no way I can get a ‘real job’. I can barely socialise with friends, let alone work with strangers all day. I’m broken.

What I would advise though is to slowly get back into working maybe the odd day. Perhaps go job hunting and see if there is something that you can do that also doesn’t trigger severe anxiety/depression."
lonely,fhr191w,t3_f4d2gr,1581814997.0,"I turned 30 last month, and it’s weird to realise my twenties are over... mainly because it seems like a defining decade of one’s life.

I didn’t do my twenties entirely correct... the first half was somewhat good, having finished university and having a long distance relationship whilst also travelling. I also managed to move out of my mums house later on. I wasted a LOT of years though doing nothing, and actually became very depressed and anxious. This has slowly just been getting worse. I choose to isolate myself most of the time.
This decade has started off probably in the worst possible fashion for me, and I’m a little worried I’ll totally waste my 30s. Then what? 40s? 

But to answer your question: yes, while my twenties were peppered with some good moments, they were also some of the worst times of my life for no real reason other than my mind, and my 30s have somehow began even worse. I’m quite worried, and wish I could start again, or cease to exist."
lonely,fhqzxv5,t3_f4g0m3,1581814306.0,"I have found women tend to be like that. Things start off so lovingly and they seem to respect you... then they become so critical and argumentative for barely any reason at all. And if you’re passive and apologise, whilst trying your best to understand their point of view, you STILL make them upset somehow. It’s an impossible battle. Not all women are like this of course but I have seen and experienced it a number of times."
