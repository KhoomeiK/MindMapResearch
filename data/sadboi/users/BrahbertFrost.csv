Affirmative consent helps all people! If you want to make a move, just ask if you can (take off his clothes, go down on him, fuck him, etc) before you do it.

Hope you get this sorted!"
relationships,f798h80,t3_dut01c,1573504047.0,"Brooooooo it is not easy, whew let me tell you. The good news is you caught it now and not when you‚Äôre like 35 and it‚Äôs harder to change. It‚Äôs still going to be really, really hard but if you‚Äôre prepared to do the work, you‚Äôll get to a place where you‚Äôre not doing shitty misogynistic things. Well, I hope so at least. That‚Äôs what I tell myself, even if I still slip up quite a bit. Someday...

Anyway, you‚Äôre going to need several different approaches:

1. Educate yourself on feminism. The patriarchy is very fucking real and so pervasive and insidious it seeps into every aspect of our lives pretty much. The book ‚ÄúFeminism is for Everybody‚Äù by bell hooks is a good start. You need to realize how you got this way and what being feminist in your actions actually looks like. 

2. Educate yourself on gender. ‚ÄúGender Trouble‚Äù by Judith Butler is a good start. Gender is not actually *real*, per se but rather a performance of self that has been shaped by the culture you grew up in. Educate yourself on trans rights too because there is a branch of ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù whose occupants are called TERFs‚Äîtrans-exclusionary radical feminists. You do not want to be a terf. 

3. Incorporate women into your online life. Follow women journalists and feminist activists and trans women and funny women and women writers of color on Twitter if you have it (and if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôd recommend making an account and following those ppl.) Just two examples but Jessica Valenti and Rebecca Traister are good follows. Read their work. You need to saturate yourself in perspectives you‚Äôve historically not been exposed to. Subscribe to women-centered subreddits. 

4. Making platonic friends with women. Can‚Äôt have the only women in your life be ppl you‚Äôre tryna fuck. College is gonna be the last place to do this before it gets much harder to do so and after 25 it‚Äôs really tough, but it‚Äôs worth it. You need to see women as equals and people, not just the beings you want to fuck. That you aren‚Äôt superior in some way‚Äîeven if you know that intellectually now, emotionally you are still reacting to patriarchal programming. 

5. Hardcore therapy. Your parents set the template for relationships and your father set the template for how women are supposed to be treated. Fathers that were born before, say, 2017 are gonna have a lot of internal misogyny and act in ways they were culturally conditioned to. Work through the trauma and the shit you‚Äôve done in the past, your relationship with your Dad and your Mom (if you indeed grew up in a heteronormative household) and explore why you are the way you are. Talk therapy is good but if you have trauma or PTSD I‚Äôd look into EMDR as well. You also seem to have issues with not being in a relationship, that you need these comforting templates you grew up with. Something to really work on, imho.

6. Consent education. This is still a part of feminism, but you also need to readjust your behavior and become a practitioner of affirmative consent. Not just in the bedroom, but throughout your life. This doesn‚Äôt directly apply to the stuff you‚Äôve described but if you have these problems you most likely aren‚Äôt a perfect practitioner of affirmative consent. Even if your partner now and women in the future don‚Äôt want it for everything in the boudoir, getting this stuff right will do wonders for how you treat women in all environments. And you should get explicit communication that blanket consent is preferred by your partner before you make any assumptions about what they do or don‚Äôt want. 

7. Practice mindfulness. You need to start catching these behaviors in the act, so you can identify exactly what you‚Äôre doing and work on correcting them. This is hard but self-awareness is crucial for this process. Seems like you‚Äôre already pretty self-aware, but wanting to do right a good deal of time after doing wrong is different than discovering stuff in the moment and correcting yourself immediately. 

8. Expect this to be a process that never ends. You‚Äôre 22, which is young but old enough that you‚Äôve got some shit cooked in you‚Äôre never really going to be able to undo. Especially in moments of stress, you will slip up. Rome wasn‚Äôt built in a day. Learn to forgive yourself because shame and guilt aren‚Äôt going to help you grow. Always keep trying to do better.

9. Educate yourself on other intersectional topics like racism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia. Bias is bias at the end of the day and this stuff is all connected by the heteronormative white supremacist patriarchy we all grew up in. Becoming sensitive of all others unlike you is going to inform how you treat everyone. We all have been programmed with some pretty fucked up shit, and it‚Äôs beneficial to approach this problem holistically. True intersectional behavior is the goal. 

10. Put your money where your mouth is. Volunteer for feminist causes. Go to protests. Donate to things when you start making money beyond subsistence-levels, if that ever happens. Spread awareness on social media‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to be obsessively posting petitions on Facebook, but a balanced approach to promoting political awareness is also part of this process. 

Like I said, this is really hard. It‚Äôs going to take a long time. But every step forward is a step worth taking, and the progress you make will make your relationships and indeed your life a more fulfilling experience. 

I wish you the best of luck."

Paranormal,f6l7nva,t1_f6kwi64,1572931812.0,"I can see where people are getting dog from that sound but if it is, it‚Äôs being refracted through some really weird materials before it hits the camera mic. It sounds like a dog yelp with tons of FX on it‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt be a neighbor‚Äôs dog and get that sort of electronic-y distorted sound. But I am not familiar enough with how ring mics sound normally so I can‚Äôt say for sure.

Still, I really don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a dog or coyote. I‚Äôve heard there are spirits that mimic sounds like that, and it sounds like a baby crying and a dog yelp being mimicked. Unless, again, the ring mic is so shit every sound has that sort of tinny compressed quality.

Also, wtf is that rattling sound? It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint but it sounds kind of like an extendable multi-story ladder being collapsed but it‚Äôs too short to be. I really cannot make heads or tails of it.

OP, do you have a pool? There‚Äôs definitely like a ‚Äúdunking‚Äù sound of an object into water after the initial weird rattle."

But 99.9% of bipolar people don't go on to do something ""great"" in the capitalist, American sense. And if you're part of that 0.1%, you'd already know it. 

The best the rest of us can hope for is to be a positive contribution to our communities, and to do our best to form lasting relationships. We're not gonna change the world. The best we can do is be good to ourselves, stay alive, and not make other people's lives worse."

ufo,f6a7dub,t1_f6a2rli,1572752927.0,"Yeah Dr. David Jacobs has said that in the recent past (say, 10ish years, can‚Äôt recall exactly) that the aliens insistence on secrecy has escalated. That they used to be somewhat lenient, but have moved to physical intimidation as a way to bully humans into keeping their mouths shut. 

I‚Äôm also not saying every abduction is for the purposes of intimidation. What I am saying is given my understanding of David Jacobs‚Äôs work, it‚Äôs definitely plausible that specific UFO researchers would get abducted for the purposes of intimidation."

Very few billionaires can say that or truly understand how they re-entrench existing structures of oppression.

Unfortunately I think it‚Äôs far more likely an answer that we simply know the public persona of Oprah, and I personally don‚Äôt know too much about the way she grew her wealth to such a degree. The idea she did it without stepping on others to lift herself up seems pretty far-fetched. 

But just like Rihanna‚Äôs boyfriend, we have very little idea of the extent of her sins and only know about the things she wants known.

Like Jacobs repeatedly says, this program would not be successful without secrecy. If humans knew about the totality of this phenomena, they‚Äôd stop it. 

It appears the abduction phenomenon has moved to a new phase, where hybrids are doing more and more of the labor and in fact there‚Äôs evidence (anecdotal but that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve got) they are starting to move in and stay here. 

That‚Äôs the secrecy I‚Äôm referring to‚Äîthis race of aliens wanting abductees to shut up and researchers to stop speaking out."
