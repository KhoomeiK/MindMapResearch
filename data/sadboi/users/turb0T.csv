NintendoSwitch,extr56u,t1_extkuye,1566573534.0,"highjacking: sometimes when you pass through a door or gate structure and zoom in your camera kinda gets behind the obstacle in the foreground and you can’t see shit. that’s what i picked up. never the less great game! some sandbox or endless driving mode would be an awesome thing, just challenging the vehicle and enjoy the endless ride, maybe some optional wether/wind and object drop type/rate settings.."
