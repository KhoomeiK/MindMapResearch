So you mentioned there are a lot of changes. I think every day you could try giving warnings to your eldest about what is expected of him. For example, when you go get him out of bed in the morning give him hugs and kisses and say first today we are going to go potty and brush teeth and after that we are going to have breakfast. Basically narrate your day to him so that he feels included. Keep doing the talking to him when he does something bad, but also when he does something good. You can also find a time to apologize to him about spanking and let him know that you were frustrated. Ask him more about his feelings and give him words he can use to express those feelings. My family just had a big move and my daughter was acting up a lot from not only that but the subsequent less attention we were giving her from how busy we were. We changed it up to make her feel included by asking her to help unpack things, ask her how she felt about moving and if there was anything she wanted to do. Please don't beat yourself up about the smack. These things happen and you know why, just take some breaths and put yourself in time out too sometimes. You've got a busy life and your children are going to be fine."

Give him the deposit, move my stuff in. There for a month no problem. Felt weird suddenly when he started asking for rent early. I was worried it wasn't going to go to a good place. It was at this time that I realized I had nothing in writing. No lease, no contract, no receipts, nothing.

I tried to write up a little lease agreement and have the guy sign it. He literally put one letter ""M"" and then said that was good enough. Me being an anxious idiot just accepted it. A week later the police were there. The guy didn't even live in the apartment. He broke into it and changed the locks and rented out my room and another roommates room just to pocket our money. We had 2 hours to pack our stuff and leave. I should have fought for my housing rights since I was paying utilities there too but again... Stupidity.

On the contrary you care a lot. It seems like you care more than your husband does for you. He may love you, but I think he loves more the thought of you being someone he can be his true self around and that's just not fair to you. He is completely ignorant to the fact that he's essentially ruined your life and used you for a long time. You've become a confidant to him in a way that is more than a wife, because you did the right thing and accepted him, but he took it too far.

I dont think that counseling is going to help. He's repressing himself again and that's just not good for anyone. He can still be a good father, but maybe stopped being a good husband some time ago?

This lifestyle isn't sustainable for both of you, only him. And in marriage and relationships, that's just not going to fly. Please take care of yourself. You will still love him, but you are your own person with you own dreams and goals and visions of what you want for your one, and only life."
