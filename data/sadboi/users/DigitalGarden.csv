And in case you think it was easy, it was not.  I have alienated myself from whole communities, I have never met one of my brother's children, i have been homeless 3 times in the past 7 years, I had to leave a marriage and a 15 year relationship, I've been stalked, raped and beaten (some narcissists don't like it when you move on), I had to leave all my belongs that wouldn't fit into my car (my yearbooks, my collections, my diaries I kept for years, all gone).  

I don't have an emergency contact even now. Or savings account.  I'm flying by the seat of my pants.  

But I'm happy! I sing, I dance, I make friends, I have the energy to be there for people, I date, I garden, I wake up in my own bed in my own place owning no one anything.   

I'm an optimist. And a morning person! And apparently I want to write a book. I'm finally meeting myself.

AskRedditAfterDark,fqb6hwl,t3_ghpyen,1589231432.0,"Is it way worse, though?

I have people insult my vag all the time.   And I never insult dick size.  It is just rude.  

As a man, you are probably hearing way more dick insults.  As a woman, I here about 50/50.  

I also hear saggy boob jokes and fat girls and ugly girl jokes.  

I think that you tend to pay more attention to the jokes that are aimed at your gender/body type.  

Dick jokes are more common on TV/media, but I think that is just because those jokes are less offensive according to the same people who think nipples are more offensive than beheadings and saying ""ass"" is okay, but ""asshole"" should be censored.  

Media very rarely reflects the real world, and what is offensive or not offensive is weird.  

I've been watching The Magicians, and one thing I love about it is the equal opportunity insults toward men and women.  Just as many vag jokes as dick jokes.  

I think the base answer you are looking for is Toxic Masculinity, though.  
Men shouldn't cry and should be ashamed about their dick size.... It is awful, I have brothers that I love and I know toxic masculinity is a harsh reality in their world.  

If you are experiencing these gendered insults in person, then you are around toxic people.  Emotionally mature people just don't make fun of someone's genitals.  

I call people out on it, because I donyt give a fuck.  You should feel like you can, too.  

And as one of my ex boyfriends put it, dick size is not an accomplishment.  It doesn't have any effect on having or raising children or sexual satisfaction of your lovers.   It is such a weird thing to insult people about.  

I think the world has changed a lot in the past 20 years, as far as the way genders interact, I've seen it in the GLBT+ community, and in the way children are able to express themselves now to their friends, and in the way media is slowly changing.   

The fact that you are asking this question is another sign of change. 
I think the real question is though: why do we think it is ever ok to insult anyone's genitals?

If you want to see people insult women's vaginas, though, just look at /r/niceguys.

worldnews,fk8b4og,t1_fk87epq,1583952759.0,"Is it strange that I'm always prepared for stores/water/power becoming unavailable?

Maybe it comes from living in earthquake country, or from living around Mormons (who are big preppers, we have whole prepper outlets here where you can buy everything you need in one place) or maybe it was the horror stories that came out of New Orleans after Katrina, but I'm good if we lose power/clean water/grocery stores for a few weeks.  

If I wanted to be comfortable, I could pick up a few more things, but.... I'm good.  

I'd encourage everyone to have water and nonperishable food available, as well as learn how to sanitize water and basic first aid.  

Not for the Corona virus, but just in general.   

Also, don't let your car go below half a tank of gas if you can afford it."

TheWayWeWere,fhf2rat,t1_fheeo0p,1581535026.0,"I like corsets.  They are a long- firm bra, help with posture, provide the best support out of any bra Ive ever worn.  
They are completely adjustable, depending on what you are wearing that day and don't have straps that dig into your shoulders.  

They also, according to me and my corset wearing friends experiences, help with back pain and help flatten tummy and narrow waist over time."

Yes, he really did fuck 300 women.  Yes, there is a reason why he was dumped/not ever called again by 299 women (he's married, they are polyamorous.).  

He told me and I was like- you kept count? And had a goal? 

And, come to think of it, he did a ""nice guy"" on a mutual friend which turned into semi-stalking.  
Which spread like wildfire, so try getting laid now, dude."

Also, I you get acne where bra straps and other stretchy fabrics hot you (tops of leggings, arm bands of shirts, etc), you may have a latex allergy.
