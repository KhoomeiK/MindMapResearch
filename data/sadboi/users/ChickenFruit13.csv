relationship_advice,etepewr,t3_cbbrj5,1562741024.0,"honestly when i read this i instantly thought ""i can relate to this"" so... yeh... i could probably do with some advice too :( i love my man. he is amazing, but i'm an absolute bitch to him. sure, i have depressions and anxiety. and possibly autism (not sure about it yet) and sure, that's what causes most of it. but it doesn't help that i'm tired 24/7 and just angry with everything! especially myself. i think i take all my crap out on him because i know he loves me and doesn't want to lose me... which i think just makes it easier to be mad about nothing at him! :("

I don't mean that in a rude way, I mean like... just maybe a ""hey how are you this morning?"" sort of thing each day but otherwise, just leave her to come to you with a reply? if there's no reply after a week, maybe go to hers and check on her? other then that, I don't know man. sorry! hope all turns out ok! :D"

OR maybe go on a camping trip? the 2 of you for a weekend or so? and just get away with nature and the peace and quiet? again, hope you're ok! :)"
