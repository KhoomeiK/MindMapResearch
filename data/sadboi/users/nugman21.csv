depression,f2z5jtt,t3_del3c8,1570507169.0,That is the worst thing ever and everytime makes me feel worse and super defeated. They just don’t understand but I’m really sorry.
AnimalsBeingBros,ewvbzvg,t3_cqa6sn,1565803122.0,I love this so much
depression,ewvbq57,t3_cq6k0l,1565802954.0,"Last week I was crying on the stairs and my cat came up, started rubbing against my legs then sat one my lap. Helped me feel better just holding him"
FanTheories,ewqp1a6,t3_cpekpq,1565673134.0,Also the sea cow milk is a valid point too
FanTheories,ewqp0hz,t3_cpekpq,1565673111.0,I don’t think I can get behind this one. There are too many things leading up that wouldn’t make sense to have him be a ghost the whole time. If he did die that night then how would there be a map piece of where he was at
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ewqot8r,t3_cplnx1,1565672896.0,That’s a nasty AoE
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ewl16yb,t3_cooy7g,1565501578.0,Bro why do you have so many? I understand having a stockpile of capital ship mats but for normal that is insane!
Archero,ewahyzg,t3_cnd9o2,1565244078.0,Well what does your gear load out look like?
Archero,ewahsjv,t3_cng7fh,1565243973.0,The best is to get an extra front arrow and multishot. Getting another multishot (shooting 3 in a row) puts out some crazy dps but can make the field overwhelming
Archero,ewahkuy,t3_cndf5t,1565243845.0,Awesome! My set up is similar but I’m more a fan of the scythe because of the knockback
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ewadn1w,t3_cnbuq0,1565241511.0,The rewards give me no incentive to try hard in GAC
FanTheories,ew628nj,t3_cmxtzx,1565151609.0,I love this theory and it makes so much sense!!
depression,ew6031t,t3_cmxltz,1565149743.0,I went to a few different therapists before landing on one that I liked/vibed with. It was frustrating with a couple but finding the right one for me was great
depression,ew5zx1o,t3_cmjz8t,1565149606.0,No problem! Hope you are doing ok
zelda,ew5zvgx,t3_cmd4yr,1565149569.0,Hopefully you post more !

depression,ew2vwpz,t3_cmjhel,1565057206.0,"My friend circle has severely dwindled down over the years.  I am introvert and don't do well in groups more than 5+ people (with the exception of my immediate family).  It's been hard making new, solid friends because most places I go or things I do are in some large environment.  In the past 2 years I've probably made 1 friend"
depression,ew2vf3d,t3_cmjvzd,1565056847.0,I've been dealing with depression/anxiety since I was about 13/14 and I'm now 26 (too!).  I didn't get any professional help or tell anyone about it until May of last year.. after my attempt.. except for once when I started telling my wife that there were a lot of things I don't like about myself and it makes me feel worthless.  She was very NOT understanding and told me I should just change those things if they make me feel bad.  That was one of the hardest things for me to hear and made me even more scared to open up/share with anyone else how I was feeling.
depression,ew2uuap,t3_cmjy65,1565056434.0,"Before I had my attempt I constantly had feelings of being a burden on my family, especially thinking if they knew the true me they wouldn't want to deal with me.  After they acted similar to yours, checking in on me or constantly asking if I needed anything and especially if I was going to be alone I would get the ""are you okay"" texts.  In those moments I still felt like I was being another burden on them as if I was some fragile thing that they needed to cautiously protect.  Looking back I realize they didn't see me as a burden but they just wanted to do anything they could to help me because they love and care for me.  I'm sure that your family loves you dearly and are only wanting to help/do what's best for you"
depression,ew2u7h2,t3_cmjz8t,1565055975.0,"I would suggest talking to your dr, be open with him, and have him write a dr's note to your work telling them what day you'll be back.  I took over a month off last year and the note from the doctor made them stop talking/asking about returning"
depression,ew2tv1b,t3_cmk5hd,1565055729.0,I've been working on trying to change a lot of similar things over the past year and it's been really hard but it's been getting better.  My therapist helped me plan out things I could change slowly to start enjoying life more.  I hope you can work through everything
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ew2tg2z,t3_clxfa8,1565055428.0,Lol this is awesome!
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ew2t7cb,t3_cmjcl7,1565055254.0,"Never, but I had a guild mate complain enough on a ticket and he got them to send him 200"

SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ew2t12h,t3_cmd3wp,1565055127.0,Oh boy! 1 million credits! 1/6 of what you need to take a toon to lvl 85
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ew2sst5,t3_cmhaeg,1565054961.0,"I think they accidentally wrote ""Credits"" instead of ""Dollars"" lol"
SWGalaxyOfHeroes,ew2sooz,t3_cme04q,1565054877.0,It's incredible how bad those rewards can be. They give so little incentive to push hard in GTB
depression,ew1rf3g,t3_cmcier,1565029765.0,"That is one of the worst things someone can tell me! I really hate when I'm sharing why I'm feeling down that day and for them to say ""Everyone gets sad, just be happy"" makes me so frustrated and feel more depressed because they don'y understand."
selfharm,ew1qsbw,t3_cmcobg,1565029356.0,Congrats that's great! Getting a support circle can help tremendously (checking in each day via text/call)
selfharm,ew1qni2,t3_cmbapf,1565029271.0,"I don't think it's an external self harm but it potentially could be doing internal harm.  Usually when you change medication dosages, like from 25mg-50mg, you do it in steps such as: 1 week 35mg, one week 45mg, then to 50mg.  I would be careful and listen to your therapist"
selfharm,ew1qakc,t3_cm79sz,1565029042.0,"It is very frustrating to deal with people/news that don't understand anxiety, depression, etc. I think there are various options for therapy through insurance, you may be limited in your options depending on who they are contracted with but there should be options."
selfharm,ew1ptni,t3_cm78yv,1565028743.0,That is so awful! I'm sorry you had to deal with that.  I haven't had any comments like that about my scars but I definitely have received comments that are very blunt/rude and I'm left with feelings of anger wondering why they would ask/say such things.  I'm still self aware of how I hold my arm so that my scars don't show (unless I'm with family and select friends) so hiding is something I'm still working through.
selfharm,ew1pbem,t3_cma40f,1565028417.0,"I have some pretty noticeable scars on the inside of my arm and generally position it so that it's difficult/impossible for the scars to be seen because I'm scared of judgement.  I have had some ""bad"" reactions from people but those that really care and love you will be understanding and won't judge.  In the end those are the people that you want to keep close to you in your life and those that make you feel less, worse, judge, etc. are not."
