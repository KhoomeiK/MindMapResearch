You have a hard battle because of her stubbornness and the fact you started by allowing her to show you a few things at first. Which is fair because youre a decent nice person. She now needs to show the same respect by backing off. Just keep telling her there's no endgame. No revolution is coming. And ask her what shes gonna do about any of the fears conjured by all those theories. Usually they do nothing other than try to preach the ""special secrets"" that all us sheep dont see. Good luck!"

sportscards,fi8ulq2,t1_fi8tfj1,1582248714.0,"Yeah most people like to think most cards are rare finds and end up being less valuable than they think. I still do it when i pull an average player numbered to 99. Ive pulled a chicharito world cup gold landmark /5. A gold harry kane auto prizm /10. I have a few rashford autos. I love my small Donruss soccer hits. The boxes are affordable and the cards look great. 

Basically i do it for fun and not trying to get rich quick. Football is basically impossible since most careers end quick. Hype fades fast. I say that but also want to start saving for one case of all major sports each year because there always seems to be one or two stud rookies each class and cases will give you heaps of their RCs. 

As far as soccer goes definitely hop in some of Cyrus's breaks on soccerbreakersfc.com and watch him pull some Fiire on YouTube! He streams all the time. Good luck out there!"
