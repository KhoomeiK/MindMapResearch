The monkey will be able to easily hold on and the cheetah can get them to and from dangerous situations quickly as they do my dirty work. Opposable thumbs are more useful than many people would hint in the world of villainy.

Dogfree,ffqtthr,t1_ffqt4c9,1580143489.0,"Under the ADA, a disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity or major bodily function. 

There are provisions made in the ADA that give people with ESAs access to housing and flying. They aren’t protected to use public spaces outside of those two categories unlike service dogs. Mental disabilities are covered by the ADA, it doesn’t need to be physical. I myself am working with a SD organization to receive a service dog for my anxiety disorder which limits my daily life in such a way it is disabling."

Dogfree,fff6tvh,t3_eszldt,1579877190.0,"I fully support this subreddit in the sense that everyone can have their own opinion even if it doesn’t align with mine but I have to speak up here. I understand they need a better system, I really do, but banning all because there are bad actors doesn’t help. I have an anxiety disorder which my dog helps by simply being there as a comfort when my anxiety worsens. Flying is one thing that is limiting for me. My anxiety gets so bad on planes that I used to avoid them at costs, I refused to fly anywhere and would rather drive 50 hours straight than take a 1 hour flight. I tried medications, calming techniques, and distractions while flying but nothing worked. That was until my therapist and psychiatrist prescribed an ESA. I already had a dog so he was made an ESA. I fly with him now and it’s honestly freeing. At home he calms me when my anxiety worsens and he has helped me so much during flights. I still take medication before flying but now I have him there with me. A new system needs to be put on place so people don’t get fake ESA but please don’t hurt people who need them."
