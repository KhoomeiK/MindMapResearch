deanblunt,fn6cpni,t1_fm4ayt1,1586695560.0,"solid point. i find, in dean's writing here and also in most popular 12-step programs, one of the ideas is to like imbue yourself with a godliness – either through an intimate relationship with your personal idea of god, or by conceptualizing/realizing god within yourself. both have the same effect, to divorce your circumstance from life's mundanities to perceive a kind of transcendence (hence, TM) and, interestingly, i think the actual final result of this process is that love, empathy, connection that you might gleam might be damaged from this sort of thinking. 

no idea if you've ever dealt with any flavor of depression/addiction/etc (i would go out on a limb and say ""potentially"" since we are dean blunt fans), but i find that this transcendent state of thinking is conducive to self-forgiveness that certain people who often deal with those afflictions may find more difficult to process than others (hello). the idea of losing all attachments, at least for me, seems to be a mechanism to let go of whatever painful traumas beset you. and the letting go is a yin to this next section's yang

>serve something bigger than yrself. you are not 'you'. 'you' are an intangible higher power. before ego or even the idea of the 'self'. all love and power comes from 'you' at this deep level. what you do isn't who you are. be present...in this moment, not a second ahead or a second back. never look back

and i'd say you forgot a pretty crucial piece of your initial quote

>(self care doesn't mean selfish. there's a difference.)

losing attachments in this context isn't about barricading yourself from the world, imo. it's about finding the forgiveness and love somewhere within yourself so that you can find the world anew once again

at least, that's how i see it."

i don’t know how important arts are to you but i feel like you would be able to further understand and contextualize your experiences if you documented them in some kind of journal or piece of fiction or even a painting. i don’t know if you’re familiar with one of my favorite musicians, Mount Eerie, and a truly gut-wrenching record called A Crow Looked at Me about the death of his wife. art may not be the answer for you like it is for me (especially at a time like this) and i can totally get that. but if you are having trouble with some closure there is a whole world of media out there that can help you on the road to recovery. you said you’re in therapy, i’m sure your therapist has probably harped on it.

maybe this isn’t productive advice but i would really love to read a book either about your experiences or inspired by your experiences. i feel selfish basically asking you to monetize your trauma for ME... but i’m hoping i can get you to consider that this horrible thing that makes you feel like an outsider and a monster is actually a kind of power you wield. i think people can gain so much by trying to turn their issues into something they’re proud of. it’s the basis of most of my art-making. it sounds ridiculous, but to realize that the humiliating, therapy-inducing events i lived through have actually emboldened me and made me even more resilient boggles the mind.

i don’t claim to understand you (or anyone... or anything...) which is why this is a risky post. everyone has different methods that are gonna be the best thing for them. but i feel like trapped somewhere in your life experience is a beautiful moral and message and life-affirming mantra scattered across time like dusty bits of gold. if your healing turns out to be through the written word, i hope that one day you can find the courage to share the affecting pieces of art you and your circumstances have brought in the world, the same way you have affected us all with your story here today.

be well. thank you.

edit: forgot to say this, but it’s crucial. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. and you can’t go it alone either. i think myself into this same hole all the time and it’s only with the power of good friends i’m ever able to get out of it. and i always feel better once i do. that’s why i’m thankful you shared this, cause now i can be here for you too."

this is mostly still a compliment to DistroKid at the end of the day, as i feel you largely lead the distribution market; but there are some really important, easy things you guys could do better that would help the platform continue to. the fact that you’re even able to be engaged with directly like this is very refreshing for any sort of company, and i value the dialogue."
