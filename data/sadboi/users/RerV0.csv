depression,fo26vfl,t1_fo26k84,1587451622.0,"Thanks dude. Iâ€™m really sorry that you had a shitty child hood. Also I donâ€™t think you were making it about yourself at all, and although I donâ€™t know you I think even writing this makes you not a shitty person. I think itâ€™s that I might choose to not see my parents but then I start to feel guilt, Iâ€™m trying to see if I should live through one more school year. I hope you the best though man and thank you for writing this."
