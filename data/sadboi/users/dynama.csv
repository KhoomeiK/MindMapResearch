HoodedEyes,fbxn56i,t3_ef1dfo,1577194581.0,"A few weeks ago, I set myself the goal of learning how to do a decent winged liner on my eyes.

I very rarely wear makeup. Every time I did I would get frustrated because applying it would take forever, I would always mess up the eyes and have to take it off and start over.

I decided that I should learn apply at least one look well enough that I would always be able to nail it on the rare occasions that I  wear makeup. I really like winged eyeliner, but I could never get wings to look good, I didn't know that it was because of my eye shape. This subreddit has been really helpful.

Here is what I did:

First, I bought a magnifying mirror with integrated lighting that suction cups onto my mirror.

Then I watched a whole bunch of Youtube tutorials for hooded eyes. Here are the ones that helped me the most:

[Crystal Lindy's Eyeliner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_UeDxkWFe3E)

[Alissa Ashley's Eyeliner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/DSFrFGMPxR0)

[Samaro's Eyeliner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/t4KyRkdWKc4)

[Sam + Nic Chapman Eyeliner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/8FsTacDaoV0)

Next, I went out and bought an eyeliner.

Then I started practicing. Every couple days I would practice in the evening. I practiced for 2 weeks trying to figure out how I needed to place the wings for my eyes. I also bought a new eyeliner during that time, which made a huge difference in the smoothness of my lines.

Here are some more progress pictures. Sorry for the poor image quality, I wasn't planning on posting them, I just took them as shape references for me.

First few attempts:

at around that point i also realized that CC/DS, BAT, CARE, etc., all cannot work as i cannot control the environment sufficiently. unfortunately, i don't have a simple solution for you, but i can tell you what i did/am doing. 

first, i lowered the levels of excitement in her life so that her stress levels could come down long term. i canceled her dog walker as running around with a group of dogs was getting her amped up. we stopped going to the dog park. we switched to calm sniffy walks at strange times instead, and going to parts of the park that are less busy. this worked ok in the winter as there are not so many people out and about. but once it started getting warm, my neighborhood just exploded with people and off-leash dogs (no leash laws here, unfortunately).

i found a vet behaviorist and she agreed with my assessment that the regular methods would be impossible in my neighborhood. she put my dog on medication so that she could get to a level where training might be possible. we acquired a garden outside of the city. for the last several months my mom has taken over her care because she lives in a much quieter area. all summer that dog has moving between our garden and my mom's house. in these quieter areas we were able to start the behavior modification program. we are finally starting to see progress, and regaining hope that things will get better.

perhaps they will take your warnings more seriously now that she has bitten someone. it's a good time to have a sit-down with them and discuss what needs to happen when someone comes over. have a set protocol for them to follow. put it in writing. i would also begin muzzle training and crate training your dog if she is not yet, as these things can take a lot of time if you want to do it right. if she is both muzzle-trained and crate-trained you will be more flexible and are better prepared for different situations that may arise."

Can you find a behaviorist that has experience with such cases? In the meantime, reduce lights/reflections/shadows in your home, put up curtains, take down mirrors, etc. I would also do crate-training if you have not done that, so she has a safe space with no reflections in which she can get a respite from the obsessive chasing. There is also a book that might be helpful, it's called ""HELP! My Dog has a Canine Compulsive Disorder"". good luck!"
