Honestly, if you have no magic penetration I would just avoid targeting tanks unless they are the only target, Zoe excels at taking out carries/squishes so go for that unless its late game and you have some good magic pen items like void staff.

Out of lane, I feel like you mostly want to be grouping with your team and going for picks while not overextending at the same time.

Against hard matchups like Yasuo, Mal, and Fizz I  think that you always have to play extremely safe if your bubble is on cooldown. Also, ask for ganks as they are hard to kill solo. Also in hard matchups that don't have a lot of poke, I usually take nimbus as a secondary rune so I can ignite to get out of bad situations.

Lastly, if you push up the wave and it looks like you have time, go gank bot or top depending on where their jg is and how pushed up they are. If I am able to I usually prioritize ganking over a turret plate. 

I doubt that was super helpful but there ya go :)"
