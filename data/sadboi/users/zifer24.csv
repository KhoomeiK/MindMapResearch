Good luck in finding him! If you do, I’d sure like an update on whether or not you sent him a letter."

truscum,fowgi0o,t3_g9sj5z,1588119320.0,"Ugh, I hate this. I know exactly how you feel because I’ve had experiences like this too. I’ve had one person in particular say they know how I feel but in reality, they don’t. I’ve lived my truth for years, and before then, I was still male-presenting. 

This person I know *willingly* identified as a NON-BINARY LESBIAN. Then a few months later came out as FTM and said “I thought it would be easier to come out as a non-binary lesbian instead of a straight trans guy.” 

Uh... no one ever has said that understanding or coming out as non-binary, a non-binary lesbian no less, would be easier. 

I didn’t mean to rant, only say I know how you feel. It sucks that these people exist. They are the bane of my existence. Just identify as cis, please. You’ll be just as liked or special with your interests."
