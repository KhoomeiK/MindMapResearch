If I had the same thing happen to me I would have noped out of there real quick. You deserve to be with someone who doesn’t forget something that requires common sense (of course anyone would be uncomfortable having their rape sexualized) and is more empathetic. 

It is your choice in the end. But please, please try to consider leaving that situation. No one deserves that. I have a friend who was sexually assaulted and it makes me so frustrated when people make light of her situation. So frustrated that my chest hurts and I feel like crying. Him doing that is a major red flag and you should do what is best for you. Even if he’s into that kind of stuff he should respect your boundaries. I hope you figure things out in the end."

I quit my nicotine addiction (I used to be a heavy vape user, and at my worst I was vaping about 60mg/6% nicotine, which most stores don’t even sell.) I’m feeling more in control with my life now. I am coming face to face with my reality, and all the leftover messes I have created while ignoring it. 

At first it was difficult as hell. I would squeeze every last drop of juice, even going as far as cutting the bottles open to get the leftovers. I was constantly burning my throat, I couldn’t let go of the habit. But now I have completely stopped. 

I used it to cope with my depression and took hits instead of participating in self-harm. But it turns out being overly dependent on nicotine is also self-harm. Took me a while to realize that.

I just hope it stays like this. Taking back control is absolutely freeing. Like I just opened my eyes. I’m still afraid I might fall back into the habit, though.."

They have that mindset of “every man/woman for him/herself”. It’s so common that a person will do everything to justify their actions, especially selfish ones. People who stock up on toilet paper just think “I need it anyway”, but what about the other people who need it too? People with equal worth and those who are in the same position as them? I guess values aren’t a priority anymore. Now it’s all about success and reputation. It’s sad that even some kids are adopting this behavior, which is not their fault but their parents’. It makes me sad to think about how being a kind and decent person is such a rarity today, and how well admired those two traits are. EVERYONE should be kind and decent at minimum. They should be, but they aren’t. Which is why even if we are the most intelligent species on this Earth, we are also the worst. Everything we’re given... most people respond with the opposite of gratitude. We’re given a whole planet. Yet look at our dying forests and CO2 emissions.

I have more time to figure out what I want for my future, time to relax.. but it’s hard when you’re forced to be around family that’s constantly criticizing every move you make. What you could do is cover it up with some temporary dye (in your natural hair color) whenever you stay at his place. Just remember that if he ever lays a hand on you simply because he doesn’t agree to a freaking hair color, then you have every right to be upset. I’m sorry this happened to you.

I know you care about him but please.. imagine what else he will threaten you with. This manipulation will break you mentally and that kind of thing is hard to recover from.

Trust me, I’ve experienced it firsthand. It takes years to recover from that and trust anyone again."
SkincareAddiction,fik9cnf,t3_f8a808,1582475750.0,The common solution i see for this online is dermarolling. You could also try weekly chemical exfoliation to smooth out texture. I heard there’s also places that offer fillers for acne scars.

confession,fif2a9s,t3_f46e1q,1582384883.0,"If my dad acted this way to my sister... I would lose it. I don’t hangout with my sister much, but honestly I love her to death. If he laid a hand on her or talked to her in a disgusting manner he is going to get it. I’m a small petite girl, and I try to hide when people attack me.. but my sister.. if anyone touches her I will not even hesitate to throw a punch or stab them."
confession,fif0i9g,t3_f7rcwd,1582384428.0,"Well, it isn’t NOT your fault. It is still partly your fault. But then again, your own history of abuse has contributed to this.

You can’t go back to the past. You can’t undo all the hits and words. That’s just the way it is I guess.. 

My brother was really verbally abusive towards me and manipulated me into thinking I should be dead. He told me I should just go to hell and die, when I was eleven. I believed it and now I am 14. I have depression and have recently consulted a psychologist and have regular breakdowns..

What I wish he would have done is just apologize. For everything. And try to fix our relationship. Even if he did that I would still have a small part of me that resents him but, it would be better than nothing.

I get how hard it would be to just say “I’m sorry for all those times I hit you, etc” with no excuses but maybe he needs to hear it..

Good luck with everything. The cycle of abuse is real. Because you experienced it firsthand it stuck with you and you reflected it onto other people. Sadly this is a common occurrence. But with your current mindset I’m sure you will find a way to fix your relationship with him. I believe in you :)"

lawofattraction,fidmdyh,t3_f7azdd,1582368762.0,"Exactly! This is when things started actually manifesting into my life, when I didn’t think about them constantly and forgot about them. I manifested about 50,000 pesos worth of stuff (about 1000 dollars) a few days ago and when i got them I completely forgot about my manifestation. Miracles bro"
lawofattraction,fidm1ms,t3_f7kybp,1582368622.0,"Its easier and more likely to manifest if you do some ab training along with it. I got abs when I was thirteen years old by repeating two simple exercises, many times.

1. Planks
2. Situps

Doing this everyday along with relaxing yoga caused my waist to be super small (even for a thirteen year old) and gave me a defined stomach. 

In my mind I could see my stomach getting smaller whilst doing the exercises. Time flew by faster than expected and suddenly I looked in the mirror one day and that vision in my head was right in front of me."
