dating,fqff5dx,t3_gim8st,1589323791.0,"> In general, what's the typical average response time on tinder/those kinds of apps? 

I don't know the answer to that, really. BUT!

Personally, sometimes I'm just maxed out on conversations and/or am overwhelmed with how much activity there is on Tinder (and other OLD apps) and I just need a break. I have even caught myself spacing replies between people as to not get the conversations mixed up - if that makes sense. 

If your personality is the kind to reply back right away, keep doing that. 

If she weren't interested she'd probably just stop replying. But I wouldn't ask to talk on the phone again right away."

People like him swear it was a one time thing and they'll change, but rarely do they.  Like somebody else said, get a protection order or a restraining order, make sure it says that you don't want him contacting you. If he continues to you can press harassing communication charges on him. Eventually he'll either be locked up or he'll learn you're not going to take him back.

I text my best friend every morning at the same time with a code word that I delete immediately after sending so that she knows I'm safe because he has taken my phone and pretended to be me before. My STBXH is also on parole and has a parole hearing next week for the charges I pressed on him, are you in contact with his parole officer? If not, reach out to them and let them know that these things are still happening with the protection order in place. Document all you can so that if comes down to it you can show that harassment is still going on. Don't hesitate to call the police and ask them to have a unit in your area just in case. I've had to do this many times over the last 3 weeks, the dispatcher knows me very well at this point. Leave certain lights on and things in certain places so that you can notice if something is off and if you walk in and something doesn't seem like it's in the right spot leave and call the police immediately.
