ptsd,fnlu22o,t3_g2g9kb,1587059728.0,"I (27F) have felt like this most of my life without knowin it. I thought everyone felt this way. I‚Äôm starting to understand what healthy measures of feeling tense are for me. 

It‚Äôs understandable to feel tense during unknown situations; however, if it‚Äôs a problem for you it‚Äôs important to understand that you do not have to feel this way. There won‚Äôt be one quick fix. Don‚Äôt be discouraged. Try new things/therapies/etc. 

I‚Äôve noticed that while I feel like I‚Äôm being attacked, the people around me don‚Äôt feel this way. They have no idea. And, they may not be able to provide the empathy I might need to feel secure. 

That‚Äôs why reaching out to mediums like this are A-Okay. I am sorry that you‚Äôre in pain, but acknowledging that it exists is a first step."

-Temporary jobs as a musician throughout my life. 

-Worked temp jobs at university while getting my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree: kitchen/painter 

-First job out of college I got fired at 6 months in. Rumor is I was only hired help through the winter. Main supervisor didn‚Äôt know why I was getting fired. It was at a behavioral health residential facility. I absolutely hated the management of this job. I loved working with the people. 

-Second job out of college I‚Äôm still employed at (5 years now). It‚Äôs at a police department in the same city. Decent benefits. For a civilian position the take home pay is barely more than minimum wage. 

I‚Äôm stuck wanting to go back to school, or do literally anything else. I‚Äôm burnt out. I‚Äôm not saving any money."

You said something that I find interesting. That you say your job isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù However, it is normal to you. Just something to think about. 

I had one of our own come to my house and scream in my face that they were on cocaine and I‚Äôve never been the same since. The spirit of the job vs. it being ‚Äújust a job.‚Äù They still carry their badge and gun. I haven‚Äôt been able to focus on promotion or anything since this event because I just don‚Äôt trust in the same way any more. I have nightmares, etc. 

Be dedicated into wanting to feel better. Don‚Äôt be afraid to change jobs, either. Thank you for taking the time to say something on here. Those that are not in this career won‚Äôt share the same understanding of the stress that is involved in the field. Breaks are okay. You‚Äôre not alone."

I‚Äôve had to deal with a lot of trauma recently. However, I have a better relationship with myself now than I‚Äôve ever had. I can really listen to myself and how I feel. It just helps me to talk things out. I should probably journal more.

I have also dated a LOT more than I ever had. And, I am really hung up on this guy. There‚Äôs just something about him that I want to stick around for. I may not be his ‚Äúit‚Äù girl, but the time we have spent together has been nice. He‚Äôs also been divorced a couple of times, and has a son.

OCD,f2u4k1h,t3_de7616,1570407161.0,"You made it through the first day. The first day is the worst.

You have to act yourself into the right thinking. Things don‚Äôt become easy instantly. They just don‚Äôt. Be patient. Reward yourself in that YOU DID IT!

Despite having a very difficult mindset to live with you pushed it aside, and focused on getting to your job. That is an accomplishment. There are a ton of people on this earth that are unable to do that at all.

I am proud of you. 

Day at a time and you‚Äôll be alright. 

The thing that I‚Äôve learned with having OCD is I assume that my way is obviously going to be right. However when you‚Äôre working with people, places, and things, you need to remember they are unpredictable. That makes someone who likes to have control very uncomfortable. Part of a job is learning how to be a new person. Eventually you can work your way to tailor things to the patterns that you prefer."

offmychest,erbe7ii,t3_c17tzw,1560674978.0,"From human to human please continue to go to AA. You have to act yourself into the right thinking.

It works; only if you want it to.

You don't need just one person; you need a whole room. 

You mentioned that you struggle with the spiritual part. Drinking a lot numbs that part of you. It just does. And there are no expectations of you at that table for you to process any part of it a particular way. The program saves lives. And it's not very expensive at all. 

I promise you it will be the most helpful part of your life if you allow it to be. And you don't have to go all the time, but it it is always there for you. Which, is partly what becoming in tune with your spiritual self is about.

If you've never developed that part of yourself it will feel weird. However your mind will wander many times in your life. It will stay accountable as your spiritual health develops. 

Good luck to you. Stay busy. You can do this."
relationship_advice,eqidwez,t3_byjpaj,1560085032.0,"Thank you so much for posting about this so I can share my story. 

My ex husband (29m/f) sat me (27f) down 3 years ago and told me he wanted to transition into a woman. He told me he ""Stockholm Syndrome"" me into the relationship so he could get away from his parents. We were together for 7 years, and married for about 3. We've been divorced for two. He was incredibly manipulative to me, and verbally abusive. I blamed myself for hurting him when I didn't realize he was the one that was hurting the most. While we were growing up I did tell him what I thought about transgendered people. That I felt bad for them because it must feel terrible to feel trapped in your own skin. 

When he came out I told him, ""I understand you want change, however, I don't think you know what type of change you may need."" He agreed with me. That I could be wrong. But he wouldn't go to therapy. He wouldn't communicate. He wouldn't change much to help himself. He blamed me for not being supportive enough. 

The only thing I could think to do at the time was work to make money to provide for him so he could figure out the best direction to take. So, I worked a lot. As a result of that I was exhausted. I lashed out at times. I was not myself. I was not happy. I stopped taking care of myself completely. I don't blame him for that I just didn't know my boundaries. 

Maybe my accepting nature finally made him comfortable to come out. I don't know. However, I am straight. I married a man. I wanted a husband, a family. Also, my ex husband was relatively lazy. He would never finish what he started. We had a bag of marital issues at this point. 

The relationship ended when he started drinking heavily and sleeping around. I couldn't handle that. Also the psychological abuse/stealing/etc. I'm too traditional for my own good. I tried to understand and be supportive. We got divorced shortly after this incident of him threatening to hurt me. He wouldn't know how to file for divorce. Nor did he have the money to, but I did. So, I think he planned certain things to make me upset enough to leave. I don't know. There are a lot of details to the story I'm leaving out.

We didn't have kids. It's really hard for me to find a supportive group of young people already divorced without kids. I've tried to date, and I have had some good experiences, but I also come with a heavy heart. I want a partner in life. I set things up with my ex husband so we could succeed. But, that's part of the issue. I set it up. We were never a ""we."" As he put it, ""this relationship has been me trying to break up with you; but you not letting me."" 

I have learned in this time that living alone is terrifying. I have had to go through a lot of traumatic events alone. I never wanted to be alone. But I was forced away from my own family that I married into. I never got to say goodbye to the rest of my family.

Social stigma around transgender individuals is just as bad as the rest of the LGBTQ community. It's hard for me to explain to people why I am not married. What happened. Because I don't know what happened exactly. I'm alone now trying to revamp my life. I have tried to do a ton of soul searching to learn how I can be a toxic person, and learn from the mistakes I've made. 

So, for you. I can simply say that you have no idea what your mother is going through because any type of marriage betrayal is terrifying. Also, she may want out of the relationship but won't because of -insert reason here-

My suggestion is to be as supportive to both parents as possible. Remind them that they are the only one that can take care of themselves. That you want to see them happy and you cannot make them do that. Adults tend to forget that they can easily distract themselves with taking care of others. Self-care is #1. 

Good luck to you. I know it's hard. Change is hard. But you can either run from it all or learn from it."
ExNoContact,epylu6m,t1_epyllch,1559642478.0,"Oh it will sure as shit feel like it, but comparing is the thief of joy. This is your own journey.

Sometimes relationships provide this euphoria that allows you to think outside of yourself. Humans are social creatures and we're not meant to be alone all the time. So it's really hard to loose someone ""in our tribe.""

Your reaction is natural to the evolving world of domesticating our natural instincts.

You can do this."
ExNoContact,epylj8n,t3_bwmtz1,1559641972.0,"Just breathe. Know there's another human that feels the same way that you do. You're not alone.

Change is really hard. 

The effort to detach from something you were committed to can be as difficult as rehab off a drug-addiction.

I am sorry that your situation was pushed to this. 

Personally for me I wish I could block mine, but there is a part of me that just does not believe that is a healthy thing for me. But I am on Day 3 of no contact with someone I was never in a relationship with. We had a friends with benefits that lasted almost 3 years. 

That relationship (for me) was as emotionally abusive as my last real relationship.

People grow, evolve, change, and desire different things. Sometimes within an instant. People, places, and things are not your possession. Release your pain. Do not assume that person can automatically make better the insecurities within yourself. A lot of times a pain in a relationship has 100% to do with you rather than that other person.

It's clich√©, but there are way more fish in the sea, and never put yourself down for choosing to open up to someone. A lot of times our life feels unmanageable simply because things are not going our way.

Drink some tea, breathe deep, and it will be okay. I promise."
