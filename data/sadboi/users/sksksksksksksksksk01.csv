Conceptually sure people can probably be categorized one of two ways, but I don’t trust people’s ability to do that for themselves.

Just looking at this comment thread alone, you can see how society (mostly social media) at this point has conflated introversion and social anxiety. For years I thought I was an introvert who just got exceptionally lonely, then I went to therapy for my anxiety and realized I absolutely was not an introvert, I’d just let my anxiety get so bad that it felt impossible to make friends and I felt miserable trying to meet new people because I hadn’t dealt with that. Almost everyone I know who calls themself an introvert has social anxiety too, I won’t speak for them and say they’re not actually introverts, but I think because of those memes and posts that conflate anxiety and introversion, using the terms introvert/extrovert is useless since so many people don’t actually know what the words mean and are actually thinking of it as anxious/not-anxious but not realizing it.
