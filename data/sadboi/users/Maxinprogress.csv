.... so relatable.

On the topic of your last message, I want to say I finally got it. I succeeded at practicing acceptance (or non aversion) for about 8 hours and it has been great. I feel calmer, I was so strangely at ease with the people around me and even felt like meditating and smoking less. Im mentionning this because now I am getting kind of a kick back which is scaring me. You know the thought ""what if you'll forget how to do it"" ? I often get this and feel like I have to note every progress I do otherwise I'm scared I'll forget. ""what if you got the hang of it but tomorrow you completely forget how to do it?"".


anyways that s scary.. but I think I can come back to this place again. What really brought me there in the first place is when you mentionned ""not trying to fix it"" and not be so intent to change it. I had heard it once but the way you put it really brought me to that accepting place. 

I was almost having a panic attack right there. It is really uncomfortable when I am in this ""dont think about this otherwise you ll start panicking"" state of mind. Super avoidant, scared out of my mind.. I never want this again.

I meditate about once a day in the evening. How much do you meditate?"

I don't want to trouble you too much but if you don't mind I have 2 more (last) questions, that you can answer very briefly.

Where do you put acceptance in all this? as a concept I keep hearing about it but Buddhists don't seem to use it and when I try to practice it it just makes me mad because I don't see what that means really.

And secondly is there a book that encapsules what you just said to me? that really get into resistance and what it s about and how you handle it and so on. I think less is more but I like to have a book I can fall back on if I am lost at some point."

Let me ask one more thing...:


Feeling -> Resistance -> new Feeling

>Or hurt. If you don't see that, you can stay gripped even though it feels like you've looked at each feeling

So that's exactly the problem I was having, and yesterday, by chance, I was gentle and understood my resistance or tried to understand it. And then the feeling changed for a more pleasant one.

and my question is..

>It's also important not to push or smother the feeling. That's not acceptance. Treat each as a guest and see what it has to say.


So you think it is better to focus on the resistance as to transform it, right? (rather than trying to find what the original feeling was)

Because really I have too often no idea what the original feeling is, and seeing past the resistance or anger is to me very difficult to almost impossible, it's like a big cloud of a knot I have to undo before I get to see what I was feeling before.

Im gonna check out the books though thanks"

AskMen,fp9bgx1,t1_fp8l2xl,1588421315.0,"Hey.


So I have similar issues and am in therapy and made a lot of research. In the end I think it boils down to one simple thing (but it's not easy) and I'm gonna try and explain it.


So basically, we don't want to feel many many things. We don't want to feel shame, guilt, betrayed, dominated, manipulated, ignored, rejected.. So we are constantly in a state of nervosity because we try to control our feelings all the time.


Just try to look at your feelings honestly for a sec. Don't you notice you are always running away from something? There s sense of panic. Then you don't want to feel panic so what do you do? you say ""it's horrible! I won't make it!"", because in that moment of outrage, you're not paniquing anymore, you're outraged. And then you don't want to feel outraged so you maybe call yourself stupid or bad names, because that makes you feel in control, superior and not helpless.

It may sound simplistic but the solution is to learn to embrace your feelings. It's called acceptance in other words.


If you want to know more you can read the books (or audiobooks) from Claire Weekes. She is really a force in the field of acceptance and most of all, she offers a solution that is straighforward, humane and logical and doesn't require you to overanalyse your every thought.


Good luck, keep in mind it isn't easy at all and it will take you a long time to figure it out (it's been 4 month for me and I'm barely scratching the surface).


What I am telling you is something my therapist is helping me with, so you can rest assured I am not just throwing knowledge I picked up on the internet.

But I know in retrospect that I want to grow out of it, because it's not doing me good. I think the dynamic of gaining point and quick achievements and quick catharsis is something you want to keep as a guilty pleasure, not defend it, but accept it for what it is without rejectinv it either.


I think, sorry to say, but you won't be able to convince me that 13 going 30 is a good movie, BUT we shouldn't feel aversion for guilty pleasures."

I think there are morals in the world, some are subjective but we know for sure some are helping. We know indulging in compulsions is a bad thing because it hurts us in the long run.


Point being, sit-coms often appeals to people's fantasies and wishful thinking, just as revenge movies appeal to people who want catharsis, even Tarantino. He is a genius BUT his movies appeal to an infantile part of ourselves. But you won't hear complaints about that because it s still cool ;) But your sitcoms aren't cool to the majority, and are a bit indulgent, so people will make fun of it and it s a sad thing, we shouldnt reject each other,


point is, nobody should make fun of you for watching indulgent sitcoms and you shouldnt feel bad for enjoying them either."
