EDAnonymous,ff6ogtn,t3_ervsno,1579631546.0,"Supermarkets are dangerous to me, if I go alone I take hours and leave with very little, not able to realistically sustain a meal, so I have to come back, but since it takes too long to get out of there, I donâ€™t want to go, but if I donâ€™t complete that task until Friday when my bf comes to stay the weekends at my department, he wants to order the tastiest takeouts which obviously are full of calories, so I ask him to take me to the supermarket, (at the end of the week, I purged so many times that by Friday iâ€™m famished) and he buys whatever I want, and the minute he leaves on Sunday night, I have binges-purges cycles until exhausted , I hate this circle, whatever I manage to loose on weekdays, I regain it on weekends :(.. I started treatment to stop this almost a month ago, but it doesnâ€™t seem to be working yet, I canâ€™t stop the binge-purges"
