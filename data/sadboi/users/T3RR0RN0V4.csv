apexlegends,fpmfpnw,t3_ge2h82,1588732077.0,"I think it might be a new pistol. They've given us 2 sniper weapons an LMG and an AR so far and the pistol class is definitely the weakest overall with the exception of the wingman. At first I thought it was just another p2020 or wingman skin but after looking the trailer I noticed a few things.


1. The gun appears to eject the spent shells to the side although this is very hard to see and could just be an error in the animation 



2. It has iron sights similar to p2020 iron sights so definitely not a wingman.



3. The bore of the barrel is quite a bit larger than the p2020 



4. The shape is very very different to that of the p2020 and as of so far we haven't had any skins that change the blocky shape of the p2020



5. The barrel extends further than the slide of the gun by a good amount .



Obviously I could be completely wrong but it makes sense for them to add a new weapon especially when they've been experimenting with giving every player Shields and a pistol on drop."
