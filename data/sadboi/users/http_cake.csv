They threw me in without training me and treated me like I was being ridiculous when I said I was overwhelmed.

But many people have been in situations like this including my parents.. It will work out. Everything will be okay."

Just like it's none of my business to accuse skinny people of being anorexic when they might have a condition that causes them to struggle to gain weight. I think people who present with eating disorder habits should be supported and helped.

I also think people who point out overweight issues a lot are not likely to admit that people who are underweight are just as unhealthy. I think everyone deserves respect, privacy, and support."

I found out what that fight was about when I was 16 or 17. My dad had written very detailed sexual fantasies about my aunt (not blood related, my mom's brother's wife) and calling my mom undesirable among a lot of other nasty things inside of a journal that he didn't hide very well. My mom found it and read the whole thing.

I started crying and picked him up and snuggled him and I could FEEL his fur it was like I was really touching him. He looked at my eyes and then I woke up and hyperventilate-cried when I realized it didn't happen.

My boyfriend says that he came to me to say goodbye and that he's okay, meaning he must have passed on somehow."

&#x200B;

Well we were in the middle of the show I say and they started to have problems with the speakers. Like I could hear the music on stage but it was barely audible to the crowd, so I was basically dancing around thrusting a hockey stick into the air going ""HOCKEY!!!"" in front of 200 people. The music was supposed to be what tied everything together because it was just a silly parody song about hockey.

careerguidance,eut4821,t3_ch7567,1564019517.0,"I just recently walked out of a job after I put my two weeks in. It was at a local grocery store and I was a cashier, but in February I asked my boss for more hours so he moved me to the bakery a couple days a week. In June my boss announced that he sold the store to \[insert big grocery company\] and I signed a hiring packet that said I would be going back to being a full time cashier. 

Well, opening rolls around and i'm still in the bakery. The bakery manager had to leave because her husband was having major surgery which left two of us in this bakery during this opening week where the store was 5x busier than it ever was. We could hardly get anything done. I went for a job interview the next day and put in my two weeks. The first week goes by and the new boss still hasn't hired any people for the bakery. I was there alone that day and I had so much to bake I couldn't even get it all packaged in time for the end of my shift. I go upstairs and ask him how the hiring is going because this is getting too hard on us. And THIS GUY says ""Well I haven't yet but I will start looking tomorrow"". I got so mad.

I went back to the bakery to resume my work and looked at everything I had left to do for the day, I tried asking managers from other departments for help. They said they were busy and I just had to do my best. I got so overwhelmed while slicing bread I started crying my eyes out. I grabbed my purse, went to the back and told my boss through my tears ""I've had enough. I can't do this anymore."" and walked out and drove away.

I called him the next day to clarify that I wouldn't be coming back. He just said ""okay"" and hung up. I haven't felt that amazing ever!"

I’ve come to peace with what happened but it still hit my self-confidence hard enough to affect me now, I think it’s because I don’t want to be hurt again.

AskReddit,eumx1o8,t3_cgzhc9,1563921469.0,"I’ve honestly thought of this for probably an unhealthy amount of time because of my obsession with all things apocalypse/post-apocalypse.

I live in an area of Canada where it gets to be -40C in the winter, so my first thought would probably be to round up my immediate family and go to a house with a wood stove since there’s no telling when electric and gas will stop working in the panic. We’d probably gather as much food and crap as we could shove into a few cars and travel south. To be fair I don’t think my parents would care to look for non-immediate family members because it would be too dangerous for us.

My dad majored in conservation and did many camps and classes doing survival in the forest so that would probably be helpful.

So the goal would probably be to find a place where the winters are a little shorter and less harsh for us to prepare, probably sticking to the woods where we can kill deer/rabbits and forage until everything properly unfolds, assuming that it would be like in the movies where there’s mass hysteria and pretty much everyone dies including the military. 

Then we would slowly start exploring towns and houses, siphoning gas from abandoned cars, get bitten and die one at a time, you know how it goes ;)"
canada,eul0yyi,t1_eujo0h1,1563895593.0,"Well a lot of people just think it’s only a prairie province which is not true. It’s mostly flatlands in the east and south, but western Manitoba is a hilly and thick-forested rocky dream with rushing rivers and crap tons of lakes with a huge cottage and tourism market. Northern Manitoba is THICC Canadian Shield and houses many one of a kind sights like Pisew Falls. There are valleys around the town of Minnedosa! It’s not all farmland like one would be lead to believe because the higher populated areas are where the farming is! We also have a lot of dope provincial parks, my favourite to visit being The Whiteshell, and the Devil’s Punchbowl is like a mini desert in the east and you’d never even believe you’re standing in Manitoba.

Most of the rural towns are either kept alive by the work on Hydro dams, mining, tourism, or farming. I live in a town right on Lake Winnipeg and our population quadruples when the cottagers come out for festivals! We get people from all over the world which surprises me a lot."
