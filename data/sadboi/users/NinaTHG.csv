AmItheAsshole,evijp0o,t3_cjx7of,1564543799.0,"NTA, and I hope you read this.

 Before you read this please note that I don‚Äôt want to sound like an asshole and emotional support animals are incredibly valuable in VERY specific circumstances. I‚Äôll be talking about service animals
and emotional support animals. Emotional support pretty much provide emotional support while service dogs do more ‚Äúconcrete‚Äù things, like alerting changes in blood sugar but they can also stop self harming 

 That said, she can‚Äôt care properly for her dog and that‚Äôs pretty much rule number 1 on therapy/emotional support animals, you only have them if you can care for them. That alone warrants you a NTA. 

 Having ESA (emotional support animals) became a trend, and people see them more and more often. It is a bad thing, since the general public thinks that they‚Äôre a common resort to treating mental health conditions. While it‚Äôs common for pets to help, ESA are one of are the lasts resorts. I‚Äôm not saying that your roommate doesn‚Äôt needs one, but she should definitely try therapy/medication/lifestyle changes BEFORE getting a dog for many reasons. 

 - A dog alone won‚Äôt help her if her other dog didn‚Äôt 

 - She didn‚Äôt try therapy yet 

 - Lots of work needed, a service dog is pretty much in training their whole life 

 - Super expensive 

 - If she‚Äôs anxious and she brings the dog in public (sounds kind of what she wants to do) she‚Äôll get unwanted attention

 - She can‚Äôt care for the dog (service animals have to be EXTREMELY well cared for) 

 Also, INFO on what she‚Äôd use the dog for. If she self harms (think hitting head on wall, very ‚Äúobvious‚Äù things like that, things that a dog would see) I could see why she‚Äôd want a dog, but again: therapy should be tried first AND even if she‚Äôd tried tat, she‚Äôd have to be able to give the dog an excellent life. 

 This got long, but I hope I didn‚Äôt say anything incredibly wrong or asshole-ish. English is not my first language so I sometimes sound a bit ‚Äúharsh‚Äù hahah. I repeat that I‚Äôm not trying to attack your roommate, I emphasized with her. The reason why I know those things about service dogs is because I considered getting myself one for my mental health issues too, but thankfully medication helped me before I needed to do that, but I know where she‚Äôs coming from.
