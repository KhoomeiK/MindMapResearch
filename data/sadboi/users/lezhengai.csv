There was a game on Gameboy Colors where you played as Barry though but i doubt it's what you're thinking of"
mentalhealth,f33b0pf,t3_dff5o6,1570635201.0,"I totally agree!!

Then again not all thoughts are wrong and it becomes very difficult to know what you really want and learn about yourself when you don't know if a thought is real or if it's your mental illness speaking

I'm really struggling with that lately haha"
rantgrumps,f1z31f4,t3_db0yis,1569832164.0,"I really didn't like the way Arin acted at the beginning of Undertale saying that ""he knows how much people love this game so he promises not shitting on it"" with a very disdainful voice, preparing himself to hate it because he really wants to be the opposite of everyone and then watching him resentfully adoring the game"
gamegrumps,ewqwmqq,t3_cpjh8a,1565682736.0,Or a boat!
Art,ewl6kho,t3_cotty4,1565508300.0,"I think i personally started to develop a style when i stopped caring, it just came naturally when just drawing for fun without thinking about it I guess
I recommend you to do some life drawing and see how you instinctively simplify things in your drawings and try to get advantage of that, it takes time but it'll come!"
drawing,ewjp5qv,t3_colins,1565469947.0,so adorable i'm melting too
gamegrumps,ewimoat,t3_cojl3d,1565452537.0,Well they are doing Chrono Trigger on stream apparently so
depression,ewi4qy6,t3_cogvwb,1565438304.0,"I'm taking 400mg everyday for almost a year now and honestly it doesn't do miracles but it definitely worked a bit for me
After a few weeks i did feel a bit more relaxed, just don't rely on it too much
It really helped with my sleep though, I'm falling asleep way easier now and hardly ever wake up in the middle of the night which I didn't really expect but I'm not gonna complain haha"
NintendoSwitch,ewi4b28,t3_cogwyt,1565437778.0,I'm always so surprised when a game actually uses touchscreen like Mario Maker 2 recently
rantgrumps,ewi29ke,t3_cofot7,1565435097.0,"Yeah, what i think happened is at the begining his comedy was just natural, the early Game Grumps days really just was two friends on a couch but the past few years they talked a lot about taking comedy classes and learning a lot about it and game grumps slowly became a stand up comedy thing, very ""we're really trying to get a reaction here"" 

Arin's main goal nowadays is to make everything to get people annoyed to the point of it being funny i feel like, if that makes any sense"
