bipolar,f1r8rao,t3_dagh5z,1569712562.0,"Sometimes I feel empty? Soulless? I also have a hard time finding a work for it. Sometimes I feel like I'm looking through a glass window at the world, I'm not in it, just observing. A therapist tries to describe it as disassociation but idk, never can really explain it either. But yes. Like I'm not human and don't experience the same things humans do."
bipolar,f1qpie3,t3_da1hsu,1569704548.0,"I like the memes. I show them to my girlfriend to explain things I'm relating to/ feeling, repost for myself to laugh at later, sometimes they *can be excessive and I think maybe filtering some that aren't so positive would be good. I saw a suggestion to a ""meme Monday"", I second that! I love this sub and honestly go look through daily sometimes when I'm feeling super alone. Humor/community is the best medicine for me."

bipolar,esd2mjw,t3_c741w9,1561845423.0,"Been on it for 2 months and just upped to 100mg this week. I take it alone. No other meds. I see my psych bi monthly and a therapist bi weekly.
Pros- not many side effects. 
Some I have had:
-Small anxiety heart rushing feeling. Unusual anxiety, not my normal every day anxiety.
-Waking up nauseous although this morning was the first time I actually vomited, probably due to the increase and I'm sure it'll settle down. Or from my late night snacking, who knows.
-feeling short of breath at unnecessary times.
-some out of body experiences but they were happening the first week or so on it, none since.
-i take mine at night because I noticed excessive yawning the first few weeks.

Cons-
I don't know if it's working? I mean, I feel not as manic? Not as go go go? Not as out of control, but that could also be cause I'm in an ok state recently.  Im still impulsive and depressed at times. My psych wants me to give 100mg a 2 month trial before seeing him again. I really sometimes feel like it's just a sugar pill placebo because the work I'm doing in therapy is helping me more than the meds. Or maybe they're working and I'm just resisting. Anyway, con is that it takes a while to figure out any meds and they are all going to work differently for everyone.

I'd say so far this is the easiest stabilizer I have tried when it comes to side effects. 
Good luck!
Xoxo. -M"
bipolar,esaivb0,t3_c4pj80,1561760664.0,"I was on 25 mg for may, most of June 50 mg and just last night upped to 100. I have also felt some low low downs and almost like my highs are finally capped. Reading your post was so relatable I just wanted to chime in. I'm also scared mine isn't working and really want to tap out or try something different. I told my doc and did some research and decided to wait it out. Some of my lows are situational I think, and I am working on mindfulness and in talk therapy to break my thought patterns cause I know that's how i get myself to a low low feeling. My doc said sometimes it could take a few weeks to adjust to the increase so I decided to give it 1.5 months on 100 mg. before we try upping or something different. Sadly this is such a process. Be patient with yourself. ðŸ’œ"
bipolar,epxkucz,t3_bwb73e,1559603499.0,"Curious how many of you smoke marijuana with your meds? Do you notice a difference? I started lamictal a month ago and didn't stop smoking and haven't felt a difference in moods wondering if marijuana is making the meds work differently? I'm only on 50mg now, moving up to 100 in a week or so.

bipolar,epxk1ly,t1_epwgmsa,1559602861.0,I take it alone. I'm on 50mg now and have a phone appt. With my psych soon to up it. Been in it since May 1st and so far not many bad or good things. Just feel the usual unstable but stable?
