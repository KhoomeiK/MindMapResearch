I babysat for my friends the first time they smoked weed in high school. We snuck out of my friends house, ended up in this ramshackle ahed someone had to put up, to keep their tools in while they were building a house. My friends smoked some bunch of weed, we bullshitted and listened to music. Then we got really cold and hungry, I wasn't stoned, it was just 3 AM. So we thought it would  be a good idea to break into our friends house steal some food, some food, and my friend also took some of his blankets. As we were leaving, one of my friends noticed a deer. She took off like a fucking rocket, chasing it down a hill, cackling like a swamp hag. She subsequently tripped on the blankets she was carrying, fell down the hill, and I had to rescue her. The whole time, she was laughing so hard she couldn't move and I basically wrapped her up in a blanket and dragged her back up the hill.

We went back to the shed and they smoked some more weed, and then around 7 AM, we called it a night and headed back down to my friends house. We left our buddy's blankets in the woods and when we got back to school on Monday, we were warned of a potential homeless camp in our area but no one ever figured out it was us. 

Never told anyone except my husband that story lol.

So I have to be aware at how snappy I can be with people when I start getting really frustrated. It's a fine line though because it's necessary to stand up for yourself. 

I learned the concept of radical acceptance in my twelve step and how to stop fighting things around you, just accepting whatever is reality be it shitty or great. That gave me an excellent head start at coping with the illness. I always let my negativity out now and I am a much more authentic person for it. Much like you wouldn't keep poison inside you, I find I have to get the negativity out: and much like poison, one shouldn't sit in it either. Overall give yourself slack, and be kind to yourself.
