They've never really worked for me on my Android nor my iPad. Connectivity issues across the board. Sometimes 1 works, sometimes it'll cut in and out, but only 15% of the time do both work correctly. The volume setting is also super messed up. More than half the time my phone shows that they're turned up all the way and I'm straining to hear anything. What an expensive POS."

Find people who generally care about you, even if it's just 1 or 2 people. Hanging out with family helps me, too, sometimes."

Wellthatsucks,ezm3s19,t1_ezjl6c2,1567985951.0,"This exactly. I've been battling painful GI issues for 4 years now. Several medical procedures, special diets, prescribed meds, and many many $$ hospital bills later, I've had to take matters in my own hands. The FODMAP list helped me identify what completely wrecks my gut. Please keep in mind, though, that combining several low FODMAP foods in a single meal can cause GI upset. Drink lots of water. Try to stop eating before you start feeling full. Make sure you have enough fiber in your diet. Having a salad a day for a few days really helps the bloating subside. Fried foods, although delicious, are the devil. My GI doc recommended Align probiotics, which is what I take daily.  Taking magnesium citrate helps keep things regular.  I really hope you find relief soon! I feel your pain :("
