INFJmemes,fn9ghu1,t1_fn8kl2g,1586772078.0,"It seems to me music preference is VERY personal thing. It's like each person has different taste in it. I read in some article that people like the type of songs which give them some nostalgic vibes. I mean there must be something in that melody, lyrics or artist's voice related to your childhood (memories) maybe even you dont realize to like that type of songs. And personality begins to shape in the first childhood period. Each person is unique in experiencing things, evaluating ideas. To me, music is like a shortcut to that road of uniqueness. It's fun though, trying to predict others' personality based on their music preferences. It makes it easier to take possible soul mates out of the equation if they dont like the same type of music you likeüòÑ"

Reading the replies, I realized that we can't control our appearence, our rbf and since we try to look at things from all angles, we just can't be sure which one of the replies reflects our own perspective perfectly to others. In my case, I seem cold and distant and most of the time I live in my head theorising  about anything and this causes many misunderstandings. Because I am a little sarcastic, when I make a joke I always expect some frowning faces in response. I know my jokes make me look oddüòÖ but as I grow older I've learnt that there's no way I can't control others' opinions of me.

The thing is, it's just never enough because in my heart I feel things could be much better, there's always something better to do, someone better to spend time with. I know it's a terrible mindset; things and people are as they should be and I should accept them. But this perfectionist side of me constantly tells me ""it's not the time to enjoy life yet, there are still missing pieces, some things are still wrong. Keep pushing and you will find what's valuable in life""  Until that time the best I can do is not to be a bummer around my family and friends and to show them my good side. 

On the other hand, progress and change are part of the personal growth and I believe everyone can be the person they strive to be if they push themselves to their limits. And thats what I try to accomplish."

But this does not mean they have to keep in touch with you later. It's just something you do for yourself and your (maybe) guilty conscious. When you keep expectations low, there should be no problem. It only proves that you are great human being for caring others. It is about you, not them. After all, INFJs find their strenght in helping others, not isolating themselves from their surroundings."
