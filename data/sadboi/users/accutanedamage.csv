Somehow you think there's nothing wrong with this continuing to happen without properly educating doctors on the risk of patients bodies falling apart with no proper way to even monitor it whatsoever.
Patients are told that they're being monitored, led to believe that this is a rare condition, led to believe that anything experienced on the drug will go away after, or (at the very worst) rarely persist.

What I'm saying is that there's a ton of research the medical community links stating NO link to issues the insert claims it can cause (that's why I'm making the reference to gardasil -- do you get it? I explained earlier). 
So, what do you make of all the research refuting the link of accutane to IBS?
Also, the package insert says ""symptoms have been reported to persist after treatment has stopped"" --> VERY different than ""symptoms can arise during course of treatment or after discontinuation and last indefinitely"". Not just semantics. Why is this different??? Because in the first case, it's presented as a small risk that an adverse reaction could occur ON treatment, and an even smaller risk that it could persist after...giving you the idea that the risk is very small (in addition to the studies that refute any link) and that if you stop the drug right away, problem is likely to go away. Patients are not warned that IBS could start with 0 warning whatsoever 6 months after the drug is stopped. This is very misleading and a critical distinction. It's not just a 'whatever you were warned'. No. It's purposely misconstrued, leading to devastating consequences for people gambling odds they never agreed to gamble.

You know another example of a drug insert that lists tons of conditions like autoimmune / GBS / neurological issues and yet then has TONS of studies saying that there's no link? The HPV shot.

The point I'm making: sometimes many things are listed on drug inserts. And then, a ton of research comes out refuted the existence of those things. Doctors then read the research, say that whatever's listed on the insert has been scientifically disproven by multiple widescale studies.

Badpill,f851q3i,t1_f850igt,1574265720.0,"Ok. Let's try this. Based on YOUR experience of the drug and knowledge of it, do you or do you not believe that it can cause IBS and depression?
Because there are literally tons of studies indicating it doesn't whatsoever. I don't believe these studies. People are being given misleading and false studies from their doctors, making decisions based on the results of those studies, and becoming hurt. I can show them to you if you wish."

It's called venting. That's why people are here. Have you never vented on the internet? Are you not venting right now by venting about me?

It was years ago, I remember 1) the dose 2) duration 3) brands of the drugs. the specific insurance info is stuff my dad took care of."

No, you can't be accepted to just 'accept things' when you are being misled by fraudulent information (The 'no link to IBS research is complete BS), when doctors are overtly claiming that this drug has no long term effects, and when they outright deny the existence of this syndrome at all. It's not just that they don't know. They completely deny it.
Also - do you believe that the percentage of 'rare' adverse long term effects is 1/10,000 or so as they often claim?"

Badpill,f84zvcc,t1_f84y6jb,1574264547.0,"Yes all drugs have side effects but, a 'side effect' is not having your body completely fall apart with no sign or symptom after you quit the drug. Let me share with you something I found someone post as an analogy for post-drug syndromes. I didn't make it up but a good analogy, so I hope you'll take the time to read it:

""Some drugs (especially chemotherapy drugs...the biggest offenders are accutane, finasteride, fluoroquinolones and lupron) can cause devastating damage without warning that occurs AFTER you've STOPPED taking them. Some of them (flouroquinolones and certain chemos) provide warning labels for such an event, and some of them (like accutane, lupron, and finasteride) do not.

The best analogy I can think of for the insanity and criminality of developing a post-drug syndrome is this:  
You're told that if you cross a busy street, you could get hit and run over by a car. Ok, fair enough, there's risks in the world...so you're willing to take that risk. You cross the road very carefully, looking both ways, and make it to the other side unscathed. Maybe you've gotten sprayed a little from cars driving through the rain. Phew.  You're ok.
You go home and relax, thinking, ok I made it, that wasn't so bad, now I can enjoy my life and move on. You tell your friends how crossing the street totally is overhyped and you made it fine, it's not that dangerous, it's totally worth it, you just have to be careful.
While you're relaxing on the couch suddenly a car plows through your living room wall and hits you. You become instantly paralyzed or seriously hurt. You're thinking WTF JUST HAPPENED?! And then while you're in the hospital googling shit you find out that this is apparently a common phenomenon that nobody acknowledges outside of internet rumors: turns out a lot of people get hit by cars plowing their homes right AFTER they crossed the road. The following years, it keeps happening more and more....cars keep crashing through your living room, hitting you, and making you more and more injured.
You're thinking WTF, nobody warned me of this, not fair! You're then told (by officials/friends/family) one of two things:
1) You're crazy, the same exact bizarre phenomenon of cars crashing through your living room and paralyzing you within hours after crossing a busy street happened to THOUSANDS of other people, the same stories echoing everywhere doesn't  mean anything, just a coincidence.
2) Well, you knew the risks of crossing the street....you should have known you could be hit by a car. Sorry it happened to you, but you gambled and took your chances!"
Badpill,f84zjx2,t1_f84yti3,1574264347.0,"Wait I am a little confused. Do you believe that the syndrome I describe is real or not? On one hand you act like the risks of this sort of thing (post-exposure onset of multi-system body illness) is obvious and every doctor should know about it and that I just landed an unlucky one, but now you're questioning it?
It's pretty simple. We develop the issue, we go back to our doctor and say hey I'm very sick, and they say ""Not related to accutane, based on its half life its out of your system by now"". And then the cycle repeats."
Badpill,f84zczv,t1_f84z1nc,1574264226.0,"Yes yes yes. I agree they are all iso. let me explain.
I took claravis for a bit, insurance stuff changed, took absorica. The difference is in the absorption. 
No. I took 1 course, 20mg, about 5 months as I recall. 
Which ends up being about 1/3 of the normal cumulative dose of 1 course. Normal side effects while on it then body completely fell apart after.
The side effects are not always totally dose dependent. A lot of people I've talked to have been severely damaged by 20mg or even 10mg. Another dermatologist wanted to put me on a course of 80mg, I said no."

Badpill,f84wuxf,t1_f84tyk4,1574262611.0,"No - I'd like to know which doctors publicly speak about the drug and its risks, and what they say about it. No need to share private interactions. Anything that's shared publicly in the form of blogs, scientific data, websites, informational videos is free information to share. Many of the doctors I listed stated those claims publicly. Some of them shared these claims via their receptionists when i called, or via messages from instagram. I don't care if I'm violating their privacy, because they are telling misinformation. And because my account is anonymous and I don't have a job or title to lose by sharing it.

Look - as an example: this is literally what docs are saying publicly about the drug: 
https://www.reddingderm.com/dermblog/the-truth-about-acne-and-accutane
almost everything mentioned here is a lie.

Another lie: this guy : (Dr. Mudgil) literally (quote): ""side effects only happen when you are on the drug...6 months of pain for a lifetime of gain""

I hope that this information has given you some insight into the widespread irresponsibility of dermatologists in their knowledge and prescription of the drug.
I certainly wish that they had someone like you to educate them on it - they would perhaps destroy a lot less lives than they currently do.

But really, I do hope you'll take the time to read this. It's a major problem. Thanks for your insights."
illnessfakers,f84wb5s,t1_f84tw9f,1574262246.0,"Which study? Show me, if you can find it I'd love to see. I've probably seen it before. The scientific data on long term effects is abysmally lacking."
ChronicPain,f84w7co,t1_f84tztl,1574262176.0,yea see your medical records if you can
Badpill,f84w6h7,t1_f84ucq3,1574262160.0,"I'm not taking down the names. All of those doctors share misinformation about the drug, so they deserve to be called out for it. Go ahead and talk to them yourselves, if you want. Maybe the docs you educated are informed, but the ones I and thousands of others have seen are not. Just because you experience on thing doesn't mean that everyone else does. I am not saying I don't believe you; I just haven't encountered doctors who tell the truth and the WHOLE truth about the risks, etc"
illnessfakers,f84w19a,t1_f84v1vt,1574262063.0,"Well. A lot of girls do develop severe neurological reactions to the HPV shot. Genetic damage from it? I don't think it's that. I think its more of a neuroimmune thing. It's listed in the insert, GBS, TM, seizures, other issues. Those are known (rare) reactions. So maybe instead of making it up they are just misinformed by calling it an inherited condition. You can't get an inherited condition from a vaccine unless you have sex with it and make a baby and that baby has inherited a condition from it (joke)"

Like, ok, so you have some potential evidence that they could be...but what if they're not? Then we have just made fun of people who are suffering, which isn't cool. Like a girl who was made fun of for having a PICC line. I saw the picture. It looked legit, to me. 
I mean all I'm saying is that it's really hard to tell if someones faking it and by accusing them of such we risk being unnecessarily cruel to a suffering human. But yea, scammers. Fuck scammers. Do you have a chronic illness too?"
