OverwatchUniversity,fqqzqmp,t1_fqql42n,1589574922.0,"But that‚Äôs not their point, their point is why risk a loss when you can secure a win. A main part of overwatch is countering, there‚Äôs a reason why flex players climb easier. There are no ‚Äòlow-effort‚Äô heroes, every hero requires different skills, watch a bronze moira and compare that to a top 500. You need to build up your fundamentals until you are consistent and then you can play the character whenever you want. If you want to practice with a character then play quick play, there‚Äôs no point in persisting with ana while constantly being destroyed by a doom fist and effectively throwing, that‚Äôs not helping you or your team."

DebateReligion,fqlhg41,t1_fq6gf7n,1589458200.0,"The growing surge in atheism isn‚Äôt due to people putting all their trust in science, it‚Äôs because people are more educated on things like religion and it‚Äôs more accepted to question such things. 3000 years ago was a different time, people were so poorly educated of course they‚Äôll believe in anything with little question."
apexlegends,fqe2kxe,t1_fqe237n,1589300724.0,But bullets would probably pass through? That‚Äôs not tanking bullets.

I‚Äôve got the feeling arguing with someone who mains mirage and doesn‚Äôt realise that as long as you have good mechanical skill you can use him but his kit provides no actual help.
apexlegends,fqe1bzu,t1_fqb15tg,1589300138.0,"There is no mention of decoys tanking bullets, that‚Äôs an assumption you made.

Also it means your whole team is grouped together- you were in a perfect position, 1 enemy down and your team at full strength. Pushing on the point is no disadvantage, especially if they are a player down.  Lose the battle win the war. Sure you let the enemy cap but now it‚Äôs a 5v6 and you should be able to win that easy."
OverwatchUniversity,fmkyf46,t1_fmk0shp,1586173257.0,But there are also factors that affect this. For example if your tank charges in for no reason and it‚Äôs clearly doing to end badly or if there is an attacker behind.

OverwatchUniversity,fmky5jg,t1_fmkvgjv,1586173002.0,So you wanted to ignore the sleeping doom? It kind of sounds like your fault here. Your team were making sure that it was a 5v6 but you rushed on with out them disrupting the entire teams formation meaning you lost.

People with depression don‚Äôt say ‚Äò I don‚Äôt want to do x thing because I have depression‚Äô they just don‚Äôt have the motivation to do it at all, it‚Äôs not simply them choosing not to.

unpopularopinion,fmg93nf,t1_fme8qlt,1586043878.0,Dogs and pigs aren‚Äôt almost identical in intelligence and can‚Äôt really be compared at all really. The study of animal intelligence is still fairly new so any evidence provided is still to be questioned.

Meaning: we may both have depression but our depression is not the SAME, therefore you have not been where I have been mentally and never will. This is further evidenced by your complete lack of understanding of other people‚Äôs depression. Other people‚Äôs depression will literally make them refuse because it tells them they‚Äôre not worth of help.
