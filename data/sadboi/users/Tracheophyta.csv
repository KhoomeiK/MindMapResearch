You'll be okay eventually. Please seek for health care, like seeing a therapist.

I'm 17 myself and recently started seeing one, it's a slow process but I know I could do something out of it. At least it is worth trying.

You'll get better. Definitely. It's a hard time, we all are aware of that.

And as of the skills, you can always try to ""master"", whether virtual or irl.. Like learn cooking, playing a musical instrument, photography this kind of stuff.

Good luck, hang in there buddy"

I don't know if you can relate to this, but just think that you're at school for studying and not their bullshit, that you'll eventually get out of this situation.
I've also harmed myself because of bullying and I regret it so badly, because from now on, everytime people will see your scars (cause yes, you can't always hide them, I personaly don't care but people always look at my arms and then I remember what I did to myself in the past), they will see you through them.
