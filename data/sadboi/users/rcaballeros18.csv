I wasn't raised in a household that encouraged having emotions or saying how you really felt. But I did cry a lot through my childhood. 

I don't think you should base your feelings on what society would deem ""correct"" because it truly doesn't matter what they think because they aren't you. They don't have to walk in your shoes, especially if we have BPD, they'll never understand. I don't think you should feel bad for feeling uncomfortable, it is just something like us, with BPD that we never learned to regulate or even deal with those emotions.

Like you mentioned you still view them as cute and handsome and funny, but little shit will get under my skin a lot more easily. Like his whistling or dumb jokes. I think more bad of him and I fight my brain all the time to not let it happen, but I become extremely fixated on the imperfections. I don't tell him this because he's already self conscious of his behaviors with me, but I feel terrible because he is a wonderful person and I want to marry him, but those pestering thoughts say otherwise. 

Usually it's not until the next morning when I wake up that everything ""resets,"" but it doesn't last long. It's a really rough cycle that seems to have no end sometimes.

One day he punched me in the mouth and left a grapefruit sized, black and blue bruise above me lip and blood in my mouth, my whole family (I'm hispanic too) looked at me and just ignored it. No one even asked, since they were scared of my dad. 

To this day when I bring this up to my father he has the audacity to look me in the eyes and say it never happened, why would I make that up.

narcissisticparents,fmgqkld,t3_fv3yym,1586055216.0,"Goodness for sure I never ever wanted to be like my mother either! I don't think for the same narcissistic as her, but I do just like my father.  

My mom vs. my dad, my mom was the submissive one and m y dad was the narcissist. I don't believe I say the same ""language"" as him, but I definitely do question where he gets his ""ideas"" from and he hates me for it. 

But like you've mentioned that you would dissect your mother's sentences and things brings me back to my teenage years as well. I was the first born generation hispanic in the US and it was like super critical for me to learn the culture and the language and their way of life in order to help my parents better adapt to their new life. But after they learned and went on with their lives they started blaming me for everything. And like you said, you can't even fathom that a child could be wrong all the time that's unreasonable. You're so right. I still feel that way to this day with them, they blame me for how they turned out, go figure. 

I wish I was an ocean away from my parents because to be honest, even phone conversations once a month, is like ripping a bandaid off. They never see their own wrong-doings and even if they do, they will blame you. I've got that ultimate response a few weeks ago, from them both. 

I wish you nothing but the best of luck, and I truly believe since you recognize your behavior and what is going on, you won't be like her. You are more mature and want to move forward and build a family not based on those characteristics and traits. That's incredibly brave and amazing. You are so strong no matter what, I'm sorry you have to be in the same household as her for this craziness, but we all support you."

DecidingToBeBetter,fmeuyiy,t3_fuqesg,1586014086.0,For sure feel the same exact way. I often times find myself reminiscing about the good ol' days when I felt secure and in control of my life. But now I don't even see myself growing or making any better choices. I definitely haven't forgiven myself for the hurt I put others through and sometimes I beat myself up over it and just sulk in my sorrow. But there are other people in my life who do see the change in me and remind me to continue and grow towards that positiveness even if you don't see it now.

BorderlinePDisorder,fmcdqix,t3_fudfou,1585943706.0,"I literally posted something so incredibly similar to how you're feeling. I am asking myself those same questions, do we stay together? I honestly don't even know the right answer. It is so hard feeling our emotions so deeply that no one can even comprehend the pain that we bear. It's absolutely terrifying and exhausting. And I know exactly what line you're talking about because I'm walking it too. I want to self destruct and hurt myself in order to get that sympathy from them but my cats are the only thing stopping me from really going through anything. 

I really don't know if things will get better, I hope they do, but each morning seems more bleak than the one before. And I totally get what you're saying about your libido. Mine is shot too, I just do it to keep him quiet and happy even though now I feel nothing anymore just numb pain. They don't realize that putting us through this maze of confusion, stress, and doubt does something in our brains that wants nothing to do with them anymore. I hate that feeling because I truly once cared about this person and thought this was it and now my mind is playing these tricks on me and now I don't even know. But we can only take so much at a time, over and over. It's like when will it stop so I can get something to satisfy me or make me feel even remotely better?

BorderlinePDisorder,fjl8002,t1_fjkxuzv,1583441691.0,Yeah I've done the same and idk why my mind goes right too hurt and sadness. Its immediate and uncontrollable sometimes.

BorderlinePDisorder,fjjrmsa,t3_fdmkxn,1583409871.0,"I don't think I have tall tale signs but I can feel my mind like breaking down totally. If someone deeply triggered me I start replaying our interaction/conversation repeatedly for about an hour. Then my mind thinks about the things I enjoy to numb myself like food, alcohol, weed, video games, music, certain tv shows, etc. 

When I drink sometimes it'll make the trigger cycle worse and I'm mad about the interaction instead of being sad and processing it healthily. When I drown myself in music I get more depressed. Sometimes happier for a min, but over all depressed and lonely. 

Then all of a sudden I get the feeling of, oh snap I'm deeply disassociated and i don't even know how I got here. It's the most eerie feeling when you're so immersed in the cycle of it, for me I completely lose track of time, days, upcoming payments, to eat, like weird little stuff that's important, but I don't have the sense of urgency or need to get it. 

Sometimes even drinking enough water seems like a chore now because I straight up don't care, or feel too depressed to get it."

But the more I'm trying to educate my loved ones and notice my triggers it's better. 

And believe me strangers will say the wrong thing, or like you said, love ya, and it'll trigger you. But after time you know it bothers you and you sort of develop a coping mechanism.  Trust me it will be better. I promise ❤"

I don't recall gaining much weight. But it made me feel super foggy in the morning like I was a space cadet for hours and I would forget things easily through out the day. If I took it at night I couldn't sleep. After awhile I hated feeling like a zombie all the time and quit cold turkey and got extreme withdrawals. It was like flu symptoms, but some days I'd lay in bed with my body aching, cold sweats and headaches. That went on for almost 5 weeks until my body finally got it out of my system. 

I don't want to frighten you or anything, and I know everyone is effected differently, I just wanted to share a little insight. But I do know most anti depressants I've taken has always come with a little weight gain. Like 5 lbs to 10 lbs."

I feel so consumed by my fears and by the hateful things people have said about me due to my bpd. Those thoughts drive me mad throughout the day and make me anxiously angry all the time. It's like a dark pit I'm in with no light at the end. 

I'm sorry you feel like this, but you're not alone I feel like that too 100%. I'm struggling so much and I don't even know where to begin. I feel so overwhelmed with trying to get better, just cause everyone else wants me to. I'm hoping one day it'll be a good day."

I just wanted to asked for some advice on how some would handle something in particular. First I have a mental disorder which I've stopped the medication for because its useless for me and my disorder. I've been battling hard the last couple months with internal struggles and battles with myself and the lack of support from my family.

Which means screaming into my pillows and hysterically crying to my fiancee. This lady had the nerve to call me out and not even know who I am or what I look like. Idk, I might be a big baby, but its something that really triggers my emotions and messes with the depression and stuff. 

Thx"
