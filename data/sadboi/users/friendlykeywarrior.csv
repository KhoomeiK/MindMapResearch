Lithium,fns8fok,t3_g3lh3m,1587215657.0,"Hello I have MAD and have gone cold turkey with lithium 6 weeks ago. My dosage wasn't high to begin with 200mg a night. But now I feel the withdrawal symptoms:
-""rubber band"" headache
-increased perspiration
-tight face
- poor memory 
-mental blocks most of the time 
-anxiety all the time

No manic/psychotic episodes but very stressed out. Hard to exercise amidst covid19. 

Do u know my brain will ever restore itself without having to go back on meds? Thanks"
mentalhealth,fm1ebqk,t3_fsdc8w,1585676867.0,"Dear OP, you are NOT alone! 

Similarly, I was adjusting my medication 2-3 weeks ago and now my body is all going haywire because of the virus. Stopped exercising almost completely, not interacting with friends much anymore. 

I am struggling with this problem too and being cooped up at home makes me very stressed out by anything and everything almost every minute minus sleeping and eating and occasional laughs from visual entertainment. 

Thank you for starting this and stay strong."

mentalhealth,fjgwqfh,t3_fde64z,1583337038.0,"Hi OP, thank you for taking the effort to share this here.

To condition your negative thought patterns, maybe could start off by
1. Cutting down on social media/cold turkey/muting those posts/stories of ppl who trigger negative feelings such as resentment in you.  Social media is indeed a highlight reel for most ppl and it can make people like us feel anxious, envious or even jealous sometimes. Understandably so. Perhaps it might be good to lay off the platforms so your attention is automatically diverted somewhere else, like maybe, the things/ppl around you. 
2. Can absolutely relate to the tiredness ALL the time. So even when I have time alone I can't be ""efficient"" to do the things I have to do. I stare into blank space and feel lots of inertia to do anything. Sometimes I feel sadness for no particular reason. 

Well exercise helps me, not sure bout u. 

Still struggling and figuring out on a daily basis too. 

Stay strong OP"
mentalhealth,fd9zvbo,t3_ekb39x,1578240034.0,"From a medical perspective, the mental health industry also does seem to have lots of room for development. Diagnosis of mental health illnesses are largely verbal(and dependent on the exp of the psychiatrist) in almost all countries as there isn't a prevalent and effective chemical diagnosis to tell whether there is a chemical imbalance in the brain or not. 

Praying for an emergence of more scientific methods to diagnosing mental illnesses so diagnosis doesn't have to be hit and miss anymore üôè

Thank you for your perspective on the allied health support of mental health patients"

mentalhealth,ex79pf1,t3_crn6i0,1566057789.0,"Hmm

Perhaps u can 

1. acknowledge that all your anxieties are all possibilities. 
2.However, we don't know what r their probabilities
3. Therefore ""does it help me to make myself anxious bout just the negative possilbities? Nope! I shall return my attention to what I am doing rn""
4. Keep doing this and catching yourself when u ruminate. The more aware u become of ur anxieties the more u distance yourself from them. Takes some time so pls be patient with yourself :) 
Cognitive behavioural therapy. Mind conditioning. Maybe it'll help to have some physical reminders(points 1-3) to distract yourself from these anxieties.

Have a great week ahead!"
mentalhealth,ex6zwkk,t3_cr8nmw,1566054045.0,"I just don't have the energy to do the things I used to enjoy right now and I have a dull headache on the right side of my head. My libido and emotions are so flat/low I can't even reciprocate romantic feelings for the girl I'm seeing right now. Hugs don't seem to release any oxytocin for me either. Feels meh but I do things(hugs and holding hands) cuz it makes her feel good. 

Meds are the same but stress from previous job has already taken a toll on me.

Things are slightly better now. I wonder how long recovery will take. Am also slightly worried if things fk up in the process of my recovery particularly in my relationship (I try to remind myself that what's meant to be will be and not to take things too hardly but my monkey mind keeps feeling anxious)

I just go thru the motion and do things but even talking drains me even more. 

Just felt like sharing"
