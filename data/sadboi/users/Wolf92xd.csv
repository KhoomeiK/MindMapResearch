That's my case and back when me and my GF now ex were together, she couldn't believe me when I told her we were just homies and had built our friendship by just having fun times / doing dumb shit together without necessarily having to involve any deep or sentimental thing. I know it sounds a little incongruent, but that was just how he and I got along.

That used to happen to me a lot with my mom especially when I was a kid; I felt the itch bad and took one of my hands down there to do what I had to do (sometimes even inside of my pants or shorts) and when she noticed me she immediately brushed me off and told me to stop doing that. And even though I had to do it badly I listened to her. Then I saw my dad do the same thing while my mom wasn't looking and I took the chance to do it myself lol

Still to this day I try to convince my mom that it is NOT some sort of disrespectful thing we men do, but actually A NEED and it should be totally allowed. I agree that we should consider doing it a bit discretely not to offend other people or something like that, but it is really damn uncomfortable.

depression,fe630gv,t3_enrs4c,1578880639.0,"I've always had the thought that feeling that is actually something normal, I mean, at the end of the day you're sharing an actually serious personal issue, not just the usual nonsense and superficial things you commonly talk about with your friends. And you need to consider that fact. You yourself realizing you're not fully mentally sane and facing that fact is hard enough, let alone opening up about it to someone else.

It has happened to me (more often than not actually) that I shared my problems and overall feelings of sadness with friends or even closer people like my family, and I ended up feeling like I was some sort of burden. Even though they always listened to me and gave good me advice, I had an inner sensation of guilt and thought deep inside me that I was bothering them.

Opening up to someone is not easy. You will most likely always feel that what you're doing is somehow wrong, and you'll have that inner guilt even if it is far from reality. That's just how the mind works when it's clouded with depression and problems of that kind; you start making up false things and actually believing them, but I think that is mainly caused by insecurity.

And as you may know, one of the biggest problems of being insecure is you tend to overthinking literally everything, even if it's the simplest of things. You just need to try and face those thoughts of being a burden or acting as if you were melodramatic, and go on and sharing what you feel. Especially if it is affecting you in any harmful way.

Mental health might be overlooked by the majority of people in our current society, and that is just sickening. But that doesn't mean you have to be part of it. Give these topics the importance they deserve, and more specifically give it to yourself. You've probably heard that dozens of times, but that is only because it is true.

I would like to clarify that I'm no expert, and I've obviously had and still have my inner struggles. But I know my fair amount of information and I wanted to speak up on this because it was a strong opinion I had since a long time ago. I hope this long paragraph, analysis-type of thing could help you out, and maybe encourage you not to be afraid anymore. Remember: Taking care of your mental health is also taking care of you, don't let any false ideas prevent you from doing so. You matter."

Even more with the fact that, very often, all of the already existing copies with the previous cover become replaced by the new ones which are movie-related. 

I don't know if that happens everywhere, but at least that's how it's done in my country. Take for example these two covers of Carrie, just what I was explaining before:

https://http2.mlstatic.com/carrie-stephen-king-edit-debolsillo-envio-dhl-gratis-D_NQ_NP_906115-MLM25167159958_112016-F.jpg

Again, I can't say I hate it because I think both of them are good. (Plus I would be lying since the second one is the version I own lol) But I definitely think that the older one looked way cooler.

Take for example some of the Rust In Peace demos where it's Chris Poland soloing instead of Marty Friedman. Not to mention they being a bit faster and Dave's vocals often sounding so unpolished. It might still be inferior to the studio  version in many aspects, but it is still a gem if you like digging deeper into a band's discography.

That's why I kinda just suppress my emotions now, I do it the best I can to avoid commiting that same mistake again. Whenever I start noticing that I'm falling into that lovely hole, I put my mind back in place into reality and accept that I'm better off alone. Not suffering for anybody.

As cliche as it sounds, love can really fuck you. It fucked me up big time in the past and I don't want to be there again anytime soon. Unless I'm mentally and emotionally stable and capable to feel mildly happy on my own before thinking of anyone else."

stephenking,fdit6qa,t3_elgzo2,1578450488.0,"Man, this is fantastic. Truly a treasure for any book collector, and even more for any Stephen King fan. My only question though is, you must have a hard time cleaning that, don't you? I mean, it is huge and it's literally so full it's left out of space. I assume it collects lots of dust and things like that.

I have a small collection of books myself and it is so tiring to clean it, yet it doesn't even compare to something like this. I cannot imagine... That fact alone is like the only thing that would stop me from having one as big as yours in the future.

Also, I realized they are in order when I saw Carrie in the upper corner at the left and it made me really happy. Obsessive compulsively happy I must say :)"

suggestmeabook,fd52zb3,t3_ek01y1,1578173747.0,"Try reading ""The Stranger Game"" by Cylin Busby. I read that in just like one or two sittings cause it got me hooked üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëÄ I don't want to say much about the plot to avoid spoiling you, so I'll just leave it at 'this is a twins thriller'. And if you've read books about twins before you'll know what I'm talking about... This is damn good.

It is only 288 pages so it's not really long, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Hope you get the chance to read it üëåüèº

Edit: spelling."
