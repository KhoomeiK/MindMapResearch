I got straight out of bed to find him against the wall clutching his face. Honestly, I have never felt so terrible in a long time. Guilt and I honestly sick from doing that to him. I know it was a instinctual reaction to a situation that, honestly, a lot of my night terrors used to begin with, so it was never going to end well.

I immediately apologized and explained that I didn't even know it was him, I just had a shadow looming over me and the rest happened before I had chance to even process it.

ptsd,fk0t3ix,t1_fjnuon8,1583765540.0,"Firstly, I assume you do not know what quotes in this context actually mean, so I will forgive your rant. So, in this context, it's about ""a small group of words standing together as a conceptual unit"". So, rather than for some reason, assuming that everyone is American ( as I assume from your unwarranted response - as being akin to sarcasm) maybe remember to look at the context, it was just a shorter way of referencing the narrative.

So, let's try this in a different way. Your friends thought it was possibly suicide. You thought it was a panic attack. So, the normal symptoms of a panic attack are:

""Racing"" heart.
Feeling weak, faint, or dizzy.
Tingling or numbness in the hands and fingers.
Sense of terror, or impending doom or death.
Feeling sweaty or having chills.
Chest pains.
Breathing difficulties.
Feeling a loss of control.

And while people do have slight variations of symptoms, in general it is not reported that violently smashing ones head repeatedly into a tiled floor in front of those close to us, is one of them. So, as you can well imagine, as someone who is actually trying to help (which on this forum, is apparently limited to platitudes and anything that is easy to grasp - heaven forbid you try and actually help, and you are Satan if you dare try logic) I found that hard to understand and pretty unlikely (not doubting your truth btw, just before you go off on another one) and that maybe you were attributing it to something that it had nothing to do with.


As for your friends idea that it was attempted suicide, well, it appears more probable than it being a panic attack. The definition of a panic attack:

""a sudden overwhelming feeling of acute and disabling anxiety."" 

Obviously everyone on here has most likely had at least one panic attack and, as from personal experience, the medical field and the actual definition above (disabling anxiety), to someone objective it seems unlikely to be that.

Therefore, if it was attempted suicide, what reasons would you choose to do it in such a painful, inappropriate time? Can you think of any? Any at all apart from a dislike of the tiles or some form of sadomasochism? The only thing I can think of would be for some form of attention seeking. That is why I respectfully asked. There are many reason why people attention seek, hence I asked. But, unfortunately, you appear to have given that question as much thought as the quotation marks.

And as per the hospital, I was not referring to ER. I was referring to a mental health hospital. Because, logically, if it were not a panic attack (If you go by medical definition, it was not). And I honestly didn't think it was suicide. Taking into account you said you were blacked out and your body was still smashing it's head/fighting others to continue to smash it's head into the floor, then it seems highly unlikely that it was PTSD. So, it sounds like something that would require semi urgent care which possibly your therapist or regular Dr would be unable to deal with as it may be something that needs further, more specific, specialized treatment.


Now, on reflection, I could have gone into more detail and maybe you would have understood my points better. But frankly, I was at work and I was trying to answer your PTSD related question, on this forum and was taking time out of my day to try and help. But yet again, people on this forum, due to their sanctified PTSD rage cannot help but go off the deep end at concepts that are a little more detailed than the cookie cutter, sound bite responses. The very notion of objectivity, common sense and actually responding to a posters REQUEST for advice on this forum is the cardinal sin. If people don't want actual, valid, logical advise and just want to be told what they want to hear, even though it sounds like an incorrect point of view and it really looks like it could be something else, then fine. But just put on the end of the email:

***Not actually looking for advice. Don't waste your time***

ptsd,fk0h0aq,t3_ffjqog,1583756674.0,"Honestly, because of the nature and severity of the abuse I think my negative response was much more than seems to be the norm. At the time I was also being severely bullied at my job (I had meetings with my manager to address the situation and advised taking them to tribunal - And bare in mind this is a huge chain - I was told by my manager that they would get one of the top execs to lie and say I was a liar and terrible at my job. I had secretly recorded this on my phone and played it back to her. She just laughed and said she wasn't worried). So, not only was I terrified at home, terrified to sleep and beyond stressed at work, but on top of this was in a country on the other side of the world, where I knew no one, so had no where I could escape the violence and because he had basically taken all my savings (tens of thousands of pounds) I couldn't afford to go anywhere. It was just a horrific shit storm.


I'm NOT making excuses, it was legally and morally wrong and, now that I am as well as I can be, I would never do it again. But at the time I was scared, alone, I'd also just got out of intensive care and had brain damage, which has altered a lot of my thinking patterns, creating a bit of me that really is cold and logical. So, guilt really wasn't an issue for me at the time..


I was literally flat broke, no money in my account, no food, also, sounds silly but when in the apartment I did not like staying still long enough to cook.. anyway, was desperate. So, working one day I noticed in the system that there was a flaw. Now, I can't be specific obviously, but lets just say that there was money around that, because of ridiculously poor management was not tracked, no real tally of the amounts in there and literally no surveillance. We are talking HUGE sums of money. I was just thinking about it on another lunch with no food. I can't say how it hit me or why I decided to, but , lets just say, money from that company became my money. Regularly. Over a good few months. I'm not talking a few hundred or a few thousands. I'm talking min 20,000. Honestly, I can't even tell you what I spent it on. Food? Clothes? Getting really wasted and forgetting everything? I was so cold and confident with it, that at one point I think I must have taken a few thousand while simultaneously chatting with my boss who was stood next to me and putting it in  my bag. It was just ridiculous.

Anyway, at this point everything was near the end. I was feeling so bullied in this job, that I had even reached out for help with the abuse at home (came in with a hugely swollen face, bruises, swollen lip etc) and was asked if I fell down the stairs or got mugged. I told them my partner had done it and there response was barely even audible. Did not give a shit. I was having meetings with HR about the bullying who basically told me, I wasn't a permanent resident/citizen, so I just had to suck it up. ANYWAY, that's what I put it down to. I have never done anything like it before nor since. Do I feel guilty? Nope. They were in the process of trying to unjustly take my job, I was so petrified to go home and I had literally no one to even talk to. I did what I did because I was desperate, injured, mentally very ill and so scared and I knew no help was coming. No one in authority or at the company has ever found out and they never will. Not that I condone what I did, but at the same time, when the world (literally, friends disappeared, the mental health services wouldn't help me get my abuser help, the police took me back to our apartment the night of the worst attack which put me in hospital and resulted in the brain damage, epilepsy, wounds and a week in intensive care, telling me that ""you're big boys. You can sort this out yourselves"". So basically, at the time, I'm guessing my thoughts were somewhere along the lines of ""Fuck this place"" and ""I hope this whole country burns"".


What my family back home (who knew nothing at all of any of this at the time) find strange is, I never did anything in retaliation. I was never angry with my abuser. I feel terribly sorry for the life he had that led him to the actions he took. He was as completely let down by the system as I was. I had sympathy for what he had been through. To a degree. Logically, I knew that his actions, at the time, were not under his control, so, anger seemed pointless. 


So, in a long,  round about way, my anger and frustration at my abuser, the police, the authorities and tbh, the entire fucking country was directed at the one, god awful company and I think in this instance, I will let myself off this transgression. I was beyond screwed, it was literally survival mode. Honestly, it appears I pulled off the perfect crime. No one knows it's missing. So no crime.


Within a couple of weeks of my last heist, my parents, after a skype call, which i had been avoiding so long, could see that I was malnourished and beaten so, they brought me home (they were going to fly my brother out the next day to come and get me because, well, as he said, I looked like shit) but I managed to salvage a little dignity and got myself home. I went to work the following day, told them I was leaving immediately and they would get no notice, because I was leaving the country, plus I had no permanent residence, so there was nothing they could do about and I left the country. My parents nursed me til I got better and, apart from one person, this is the first time I have ever told anyone this. My secret life of crime.

ptsd,fjnkqnq,t3_feex0z,1583509456.0,"So, you felt happiness, sadness, anxiety and guilt but you think you don't feel any emotions anymore? Those are all as valid emotions as any other. It's just that your traumatic experience is exceptionally recent and your emotions are deadened for a while after as you are processing everything. The thing is, negative emotions unfortunately seem to be the stronger so when trauma happens only the stronger ones show themselves. They do return slowly over time as the healing process carries on. I mean, you can't have been diagnosed that long ago, so I think you just need to be a little patient, this can be a long process. Have you spoken to your therapist/psychiatrist about this?"
relationship_advice,fjngu7g,t1_fjnb5qa,1583507085.0,"This is the last thing I post on this thread as it is getting ridiculous. I'm not refusing to understand. I understand it perfectly. You are just not getting it. At present we know:

1) She Consented to have ""great sex"" - her words.

2) at some point, he pulled out the handcuffs they had, which they had used before.

3) Placed said hand cuffs on her. 

4) This caused her pain.

5) She asked he remove them, he did not. 

6) She asked again, he then did.

So, points 1 - 4, there are no doubts they happened (well, there are doubts as literally we have one persons side of the story). But let's take that as given.

Point 5, yes, she may well have asked him to remove them. But do we know he heard? Even so, without her saying stop to the sex, currently she has just asked him to take them off etc.

Point 6, she asked again and he did. If he was intent on ""raping"" her, why would he suddenly just stop on the second request? Why not wait until the tenth time? Or just ignore her completely? It could literally have been a second between her asking the first and second time. He may not have even have chance to register the first time by the time the second question happened. Or he may have a hearing issue. Literally, we only have one side of the story and we have no clue what the version of the events is. 

Two things are wrong with what happened. He should have checked before putting them on first of all. But, they were used previously, so there was past form and he stupidly did not take her seriously. And he did not stop within a millisecond of her asking him. But did on the second attempt. We literally have no clue about what actually happened as we have one persons subjective view of the incident. But what I'm doing is being objective. What you are doing is jumping in with both feet with the whole ""the woman is always telling it exactly the way it is"". Well, personally, if I was in that situation and this is the first time anything like this had happened, I certainly would not instantly jump to going on a public forum and accusing them of rape. It is not a word to be used lightly and with what we know (very little) it cannot as yet be called rape. No matter how many times you repeat that it is. So, you'll excuse me if I don't jump on the band wagon of accusing someone of something so heinous without knowing the facts.

Rape is not what you believe at the time it to be, it is a specific thing. Consent. Not consent as to what was upon their bodies at the time. Consent to have sex. did she give consent for sex? Yes. Did she withdraw the consent for sex. No. Did she withdraw the consent to use the hand cuffs? Yes. Which he did do. Once again, we literally know nothing about this story, so we cannot assume anything. For example, she may have asked him to stop, he didn't hear and asked her to repeat, then she said it again, he heard and stopped. He stopped when he understood what she was saying. Would you call that rape too? (even though, it's still not rape anyway. It's false imprisonment)."
whatsthissnake,fjn9ehq,t1_fjn7q1l,1583501863.0,"Interesting take.

Like I said, something doesn't add up and sometimes to figure things out, you need to ask questions. Not in a malicious way, there are many reasons people would attention seek in this way, there was no judgement. A lot of people do a lot of things for attention (including threatening suicide) to ask if this is a reason is a completely justifiable question.

Yes, the consent for sex can be withdrawn at anytime. That is not what she was withdrawing. She was asking him to take off the handcuffs. Multiple requests (2), which literally could have been a second apart about taking the cuffs off. Still not Rape. Literally end of discussion. If this went before a judge they would tell you exactly the same thing. I can't explain this any simpler for you."
relationship_advice,fjmzou6,t1_fjmyrad,1583492026.0,"Nope, she consented and described it as great sex. The only thing she took issue with was she was uncomfy and in pain from the hand cuffs. She asked him to take them off and then she asked him again and he did. Now, we don't know how she said it, if he heard and how long it was between the two times. It could literally have been two seconds until he actually stopped. Not rape. She consented to sex. He put on cuffs which she did not want. She asked him to stop with the cuffs twice, with no knowledge of if he heard and the time between the two times. On the second time when he realised that she was in discomfort, he stopped all activity. 

This is all irrelevant anyway. The issue isn't the sex as, she obviously wanted it as she states this (rape is forcing yourself on someone without consent...). The issue we have here is either:


1) He needs to listen to her more and when it comes to sex actually take her seriously and do what she asks the first time (not the second)

2) Maybe get his hearing checked. As he obviously stopped when he knew she was in distress, so why not the first time?

3) Or, it could possibly be that, shock horror, she did not say it loud enough and in the heat of the moment he honestly did not hear and as soon as he did he stopped. 


The question is not whether this was rape as she gave consent and did not withdraw the consent for sex. She withdrew the consent for handcuffs. Which is not rape. She could possibly get him done for false imprisonment if she was so inclined. As reddit is all about ludicrous over reactions, it would not surprise me if that would happen.


And just for clarification, if indeed she had changed her mind re the sex at any time then yes, I would say it was rape. But she did not. This whole, even look at a girl the wrong way and we'll call it rape culture has to stop. It belittles people who actually suffered a horrifying traumatic event and is also exceptionally damaging to the person accused when it was, by definition, not rape.

Still not rape."

But to call it rape is factually incorrect and could be extremely damaging. 


So, what I personally would do is sit him down. Explain to him that he did not listen to you and that he needs to be more aware (the fact that when you showed actual distress he did stop shows that he probably just got caught up in the moment - which is no excuse btw) and how it made you feel.


Also, try not to throw the word rape around. By definition this was consensual sex. It got too rough for you for a bit and he ignored your first request, but then when he realised what he was doing and you were distressed he stopped. This is not rape."

mentalhealth,fjgf0yy,t1_fjge5mc,1583324550.0,"I was on Citalopram 100mg, Beta Blockers, Diazepam, Sleeping tablets and something else which I can't for the life of me remember. Citalopram is generally prescribed for depression at 20mg (I just realised my maths was off!).

I've been off all that for four years now. I did have a minor relapse caused by exceptionally stressful personal circumstances, however they prescribed me a really small dose (15mg) of mirtazapine. I would highly recommend that, it's one of the new gen anti depressants and you take it at night, One of the benefits is, it really helps with sleep. Prior to taking this I was getting 3.5 - 4 hours sleep a night. The first night I took it, I got 11 hours! But, with this one you really need to go slow when coming off.

When I was 19 I was also on Prozac for a short while when at Uni. I would never recommend it. I was suffering from mild depression which was affecting my eating.

You break your leg, you get a cast, you get bronchitis, a dose of antibiotics. Depression? People suddenly become scared of a thing that can drastically improve their lives...

Now, having said that, not all depression requires anti depressants. That's down to your Dr and yourself to decide. But I would look at it this way. Is the depression negatively impacting your life? Are you not doing things? You missing out on things? Missing school/work. If yes to one or more of those things, then it seems to me that you have your answer. It's not a question of should I/shouldn't I? It's a question of, you need them.

As for side effects, honestly, I can't tell you what they are for a normal dose. Because what I have is more severe than depression (not minimizing depression btw), my dose was literally five times higher than the norm. However, yes, I did get side effects, but even then, nothing major. Apart from my penis decided to completely stop working (it's fine now, just in case you wondered! lol) But, 5 times larger dose than for depression. Remember, side effects vary from person to person. Some people feel nothing. Others turn mental. It's a sliding scale.

But 2 pieces of advice:

1) Anti depressants are not a short fix thing, They take weeks to even start to have an effect and you should expect to be on them at least a year. Do not, I repeat, Do Not, stop and start them. Take them as prescribed. My emotions were all over the place if I forgot.

2) Under no circumstances just stop taking them. I thought I was weening myself off them by taking two weeks and slowly reducing the dose. It was meant to be done over a year. Now, you get some horrifying side affects from that. Hallucinations, electric shocks through your body, anger issues, headaches, even had an allergic reaction to not being on them. SO, just follow your doctors advise and you'll be fine.

In Summary, different anti depressants affect different people in different ways. You may have to hunt around for the right one (or you may be lucky and get prescribed it first!). But don't worry about taking them. As long as you do it as prescribed!"

Firstly, get down off your high horse, it must be very lonely up there. The way you view sex is your opinion and your opinion only. It could be argued as prudish and immature. I assume you are very young?


Sex is many things to many people. And it does not necessarily have anything to do with love. Or indeed trust or emotion. And all the talking in the world does not tell you if you are compatible. You may get in your perfect relationship and find you are completely incompatible in the bedroom. Then what would you do?

So, my suggestion to you and your puritanical views is, maybe live a little and don't be a Debbie Downer. Realize that your views are just that. Yours. No one elses. Maybe get over yourself a little.


Or alternatively, do whatever."

ptsd,fi6l7hw,t3_f6pt6p,1582199743.0,"Honestly, it's not just you. I have never felt any anger towards my abuser. I have felt immeasurable pity and sadness for them, but never once have I felt angry. In my situation, my ex was an unmedicated (and undiagnosed at the time) paranoid schizophrenic. Violently abusive for a year and a half. Couple of trips to intensive care and permanent damage. In fact, just on Monday night I had an epileptic fit caused by the brain damage he did. So, constant reminders of the trauma. However, at no point have I felt angry at him. The reasons for this are:


1) He was literally ill. When he was beating me or stomping on my head, or trying to knife me in the chest, you could see in his eyes that the person he was, was just not there. When it was all over, he would suddenly return and not really know what was going on. It was so sad to see the realisation dawn to be honest.

2) I could have left. I made the decision to stay because I was aware that if I was not there, then he would have literally no one and would probably top himself. I thought I was strong enough to take it and not fight back. I was wrong. That mistake was on me. Not victim blaming myself there, I just completely underestimated how awful things were going to get and then I was too far down the rabbit hole to escape.


No, any anger I feel is directed purely to the city I lived in at the time. To the government bodies I turned to for help, but continually did nothing. The police who, after getting a call for assistance, told me I'm a big boy and that we could sort it out between ourselves. Only to be hospitalized that night in intensive care. Or the woefully inadequate mental health teams who couldn't do anything unless he requested help and who's best advise was to barricade myself in the spare room to sleep.

So, in a long winded way, what I'm saying is, it's sometimes not possible to be angry with the abuser because of mitigating factors. Pity is very much possible. The fact that they are like that shows some awful things happened to them. Any human can feel empathy for that without excusing their actions. I would actually say that no longer feeling the anger is a good thing for you. The anger is so damaging and to let it go is a little relief.


Sorry for the rambling!"
ptsd,fi6k3ys,t3_f6hk8r,1582198499.0,I have hand spasms. Depending on how stressed I am they are either clenching and unclenching or if I'm really about to blow they are completely flexed and rigid.
ptsd,fi3tq6a,t3_f5cvfj,1582127454.0,"Honestly, to most people, that would be a major over reaction. Sorry. It may be your ""normal"", but to most people contact such as a light touch on someones arm etc is not bad (obviously, if they touched you in certain places I can completely see why you reacted as you did) and certainly would not warrant a blood curdling scream and definitely not crying. 


It's marginally confusing, as you said it was aggressive? In what way is it aggressive exactly? Do they punch you in the arm? In what way can a touch be loud exactly? And also, what, in your mind, constitutes rowdy? As touching people (in certain areas - until advised otherwise, which you have said you have not) is perfectly normal. You are not ""attracting this attention"", you are in fact being treated exactly the same as everyone else. Where as blood curdling screams etc in public, for a minor infraction, which to probably 99.5% is literally nothing, is not, by definition, a normal reaction.


So, to you, I can see that there is this pent up fear which is just the base line reaction. But you must see that this is not the entry level reaction? You say you have had 5 years of therapy and you are still doing this? Is your therapist aware of this? If not, you should really tell them as, honestly, if you do think this is a normal reaction, then I think they should be made aware, it's probably something they would very much want to take a look at with you. It must be terribly stressful to be constantly living in this state..


So, in conclusion. To you, this may feel a perfectly understandable reaction. I mean, from what little info you gave it's completely understandable. However, in society, that kind of behaviour is not only damaging to yourself (you come across extremely agitated, possibly a little manic etc?) but also the person you aimed it at (the embarrassment, worry etc). So, my advise would be speak to your therapist or Dr, get some extra help. Maybe be slightly more understanding and realize that your perceived idea that people scare you on purpose may be misguided and possibly paranoia (unless you have some more info that you have not provided).

relationship_advice,ffc4nul,t1_ffc3052,1579791433.0,"Ok. I'll break it down.

Abusers is a VERY broad term. Worst of which is murder, the least of which is Shouting and calling names (for example). He is on the shouting and calling names side of the spectrum. I'm unsure how long this has been going on, but let's say not very long. He has realized he has a problem and now wants to go about fixing it. You are saying, because he shouted at some one (doesn't matter about what was said) and called them names (obviously, impactful to the person shouted at) that they should never be allowed to be in a relationship again? Is this what you are saying?


Because the problem I see with this, these statistics (please could you let me know your source so I can look) do they specify what kind of abuse they are talking about. Because I do not believe someone who is a bit shouty will have the same statistical probability of successful rehabilitation as a severe physical abuser. The two are not remotely comparable.


He may well have been impatient with therapists, but that can change. A lot of people do and make great progress. But if he tried he may well be fine.

If you could provide me with the source material that bolsters your claim that people who have verbally abused/shouted at partners are as like to successfully rehabilitate as compared to pedophiles, then I obviously will accept it and eat my words. However, I have a feeling this study would be about people who are further up the scale. If you see what I mean?

Obviously, in all this the person being abused is the most important person in the scenario and any partner/future partner of the abuser must be safe. However, to say that someone should never have a partner ever again because they literally shouted at someone (there was no physical abuse) seems extreme to say the least.

What I would do, is plan the departure (where to stay, save money etc), make sure that he has no clue, then when he is out one day. Pick up your bag and walk out the door. 

Obviously, I would be careful. But the fear of what he might do should not stop you looking after yourself.

Good Luck."

Unfortunately I can relate atm (for the last 6 years tbh), I have no friends at all, not a single one. I suffer from a form of ASPD and PTSD, so I am exceptionally nervous in large groups and when I am on my own, people notice that there is something that they consider not quite right. Needless to say, I disagree with that assessment! Anyway, I understand what that level of loneliness can do.

I honestly don't have any advice on how to stop this situation (otherwise I would have taken it myself!). However, I can give you advise what not to do...

It's awful when you feel people are pitying you. It's embarrassing and it reminds you of how much of a social failure you are. Try and avoid doing that

Make sure that he has some form of communication regularly. There is nothing worse then getting up every morning to nothing on your phone. 

In this situation, he may appear outwardly normal, but may be really suffering underneath. You try and project an everything is fine image, even if it is falling apart inside. Not sure how his Autism affects this though.

Finally, if your sister can't get her act together, get him away from her. There is a difference between sibling rivalry and down right nasty bullying.

Hope things improve for him. :)"

I assume you are in the US, hence you have to pay for medication?"
Advice,ff62vra,t1_ff62j7b,1579617760.0,"Yes, I have severe memory issues. It's quite scary isn't it? So, I can understand that to a point. But I've never heard of anyone forgetting feelings..."
Advice,ff62myh,t1_ff626rn,1579617580.0,"Well, like I said, who actually chooses to be that way? Honestly, if you want advice about that, see a Dr. It's very sad that someone feels that way about life. If you get anti depressants, you may get your wish and feel nothing if they put the dose high enough... That's about the only way to go emotionless in a real time context. Or get some brain trauma. Which I wouldn't suggest.."
Advice,ff620tb,t1_ff60dvh,1579617126.0,"You just said you have only been like this for two years? You obviously know what emotions feel like (unless you are 4). What mental health issues are we talking here? (Sorry, if it's a personal question, just don't tell me if you don't want to)"
Advice,ff60sdb,t1_ff609k6,1579616192.0,"Well, why else would you actually be here asking this? Serious question, not sarcasm. 

The amount of people that come online and say, oh, I don't feel anything for my family or bladah bladah hinting at them have sociopathy or something, is ridiculous. 

So, it's saving your ass? This, whatever it is you are doing. Yes, it saved my arse at one point. Mine was a physical and psychological response to horrific circumstances. However, now I'm not in them, I would give anything to get rid of it. But I'm stuck with it. Forever. So, you'll have to forgive me over not understanding why anyone would choose this for themselves."
