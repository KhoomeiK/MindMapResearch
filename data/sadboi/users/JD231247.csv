I used to be seen as the comedian in my group of friends, but now it feels hard to even crack even the slightest bit of banter without immediately regretting it. Being clinically depressed is not fun I feel as if all the personality i\`ve previously had has just been deleted from my mind, however it's at moments like these that I have to remember that this is  just my mental illness talking and  that though it may feel hard i must push through and try my hardest to let my personality break through to show that even though under all this anger and disgust my best self is still there."

So i guess I\`ll say that I know this feeling but I won't try to say i understand your pain as everyone deals with grief in a different way. My dad died a few years ago, so in some ways I know what it\`s like to deal with this sort of grief, when something like this happens you can feel somewhat numb and overwhelmed. The best advice i can give ( i know i\`m not an expert) is to not retreat into yourself, i feel as if this is a problem with people suffering with depression the further you retreat into yourself the worse you will feel. Just try your hardest to be there for the other people in your life who loved your mother and feel free to share in their grief and work to help them recover, espicially if you suffer from depression genererating connections with people is important. 

Apart from that I would say to just keep in mind that though you may experience massive amounts of grief at the moment that it does get better, I know that sounds cliche but it really is the truth, what we experience in life may appear negative but we must push through it to reach the posivtive and once we finally get there all that pain and struggle feels worth it."
