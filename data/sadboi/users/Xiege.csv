adderall,fr22j9v,t1_fr0eyjg,1589830048.0,"Indeed. My first week on adderall was just like how you described. I was floating through that week, and it was great. I wanted to love everyone, and my second job is at a restaurant as a waiter, and it had really positive effects on my relationship with my patrons. I was averaging 25%+ in tips, whereas normally I barely ever break 20% because 1.) I’m not good with social cues, and 2.) I get so scattered when we’re busy that I forget to refill drinks/check on my customers regularly. Adderall solved both of those problems. I learned pretty quickly however that I couldn’t rely on that feeling to carry me through life because they diminish pretty quickly. Now it just does what’s it’s prescribed to do, help me focus/and be more attentive. Don’t feel guilty about the magic, but do be aware it will likely fade into a fond memory with continued adderall use."

kratom,fqa65tl,t3_ghfdta,1589213514.0,"Unfortunately, a lot, (not all, there are plenty of highly knowledgeable doctors) don’t know much of anything in pharmacology. The general public assumes they are the all knowing, all seeing gods when it comes to medication. I’ve had way to many experiences with doctors that made me facepalm. I had a doctor prescribe me with Strattera. I went home and googled it, it’s a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It was causing me to have chills constantly, goosebumps etc. (“adrenaline rushes”). I call my doctor and she tells me no, it can’t be from Stattera, it’s a stimulant and should work like adderall, only safer. I found a new doctor that next month. 

When it came to the opiates/opioid “crisis”, doctors didn’t know piss all about the drugs, and were taking pharmaceutical companies commercials about the drugs as fact. Similarly, now they believe the drugs are the devil thanks to the DEA disproportionately attacking all opiates due to heroin and illegal fentanyl deaths. 

With just some well sourced and methodical research in your spare time, it’s incredibly easy to know more than doctors about a majority of drugs. Do they still know tons more than me about the medical practice? Of course, but when it comes to the things I’m swallowing, whether medical or recreational, I like to be informed."

You didn’t say if it’s prescribed or recreational, but if it’s prescribed, I would avoid upping the dose on your own. Not only are you going to run out of meds before your refill, but you’re going to skyrocket your tolerance and make the medication ineffective. If it’s recreational, you’ll probably need to take a couple weeks off before you can expect your desired results.

Edit- if you really feel the medication isn’t helping you to focus, try not taking it for a few days, and see how you feel focus wise while you’re unmedicated. If there’s no change, the medication isn’t working for you and I would talk with your doctor."

stimuluscheck,fopff3o,t3_g8snz7,1587960103.0,Who knows...seems like it’s 50% having your s*** straight and 50% luck.
stimuluscheck,fopdx7n,t3_g8snz7,1587959052.0,"It’s picky about addresses, and other little details. I’d recommend downloading a transcript of both your ‘18 and ‘19 taxes, and copying the information exactly how you see it on there. Good luck to you!"
stimuluscheck,fopdrwf,t3_g8sk4v,1587958948.0,"Could just be a fluke error. Did you have a small unpaid child support payment? Did you owe your bank/prepaid tax refund card any anything, or incur any fees? From what I’ve read, Bank fees/overdrawn accounts and unpaid child support is really the only thing that can touch that money."
stimuluscheck,fopdfch,t3_g8snz7,1587958713.0,"You’re going to have to go off of 2018 most likely. Can’t he just insert his information, and you insert your information? He gets $1200 and you get $1200? If you don’t do anything and try to wait for them to process your 2019 taxes, they’re just going to mail a paper check to your address on your 2018 taxes, if they haven’t done so already."
stimuluscheck,fonb1md,t1_fonaryg,1587916004.0,"If she got a refund advance, it’s the parent bank of the tax preparer, they funnel it through their accounts first, take the fees, and then send you the scraps on your turbo card/emerald card/whatever other high fee prepaid cards"
MechanicAdvice,fokmnjp,t3_g808i7,1587844925.0,"The car has a 1.4L with a turbo, and it’s currently at 80k miles."
stimuluscheck,fok5hin,t3_g7x7u1,1587835762.0,It was from the Wall Street Journal IIRC. Should be better than CNN at least.
stimuluscheck,fok5c0l,t3_g7vpk1,1587835681.0,I would try and file a non filers return through the portal on the irs website. It’s worth a shot. Worst case scenario it will be on your 2020 tax return.
stimuluscheck,fok4btd,t3_g7x7u1,1587835164.0,"Join the club, everyone who updated their DD info on the 15th are on the same boat waiting for a payment date. A news outlet reported they should be going out over the weekend and deposited Wednesday or so. Don’t know how reliable that info is."
stimuluscheck,fojugy3,t3_g7vlbn,1587829635.0,You need to mail in an amended return. The IRS is very strict.
stimuluscheck,fojjqjx,t3_g7sfqe,1587822732.0,"There seems to be a little variance, but at least this was the case in my experience. Somethings causing people to get locked out for days at a time."
stimuluscheck,fojj80y,t3_g7tl9w,1587822358.0,"It’s possible, more likely late May. No one really has a solid answer currently."
stimuluscheck,fojis41,t3_g7tl9w,1587822031.0,They aren’t processing returns currently from what I’ve heard. You’re going to have to wait until they get the majority of these checks off their shoulders most likely.
stimuluscheck,fojioy4,t3_g7tmb0,1587821965.0,"I wouldn’t bank on it, but it’s possible."
stimuluscheck,fojik8w,t1_fojhugl,1587821867.0,"Well, we have no idea about the specifics of your situation. If you were on payroll, and received a paycheck in return for hourly work, or if you had a salary, I’d assume they would have sent you a W-2 form. If not, you can request another one from them, or it may be available online through your employee portal or w/e Amazon has. Past that, if you held stocks/investments that appreciated in value, you would need to file a form 1099. I would 100% recommend consulting a CPA, you don’t have to use H&R Block, but someone reputable for sure. They should be able to ask you some questions and guide you through what forms you need to request/fill out etc."
stimuluscheck,foji5f1,t3_g7tb3j,1587821555.0,"We’re not talking math here, I’m talking about the actual process of getting all the required tax forms/filling everything out/filing them/amending them etc."
stimuluscheck,fojhrcd,t3_g7tb3j,1587821243.0,"I don’t know how they are going to handle people in your situation, it’s somewhat unique. You have until July 15 to file and pay your taxes if you owe, but if you want any chance of getting that check before next year, I’d get it done ASAP."
stimuluscheck,fojhiut,t3_g7tc06,1587821059.0,Double check your return transcripts and make sure you didn’t mark yourself down as a dependent.
stimuluscheck,fojhg02,t3_g7td2p,1587820995.0,"No no no, no more stimulus checkd for you. (Consuela walks away)"
stimuluscheck,fojh8iq,t3_g7sxte,1587820832.0,You’d be absolutely astonished with what the internet can do with limited information.
stimuluscheck,fojh58e,t1_fojgv0y,1587820760.0,It’s not exactly taught in school. I know a few people who just send their forms to a family member and let them deal with it for them.
stimuluscheck,fojh153,t3_g7tb3j,1587820670.0,"Your tax situation seems fairly complicated, but I would assume you would need form 1099 for investment income. Might be a good idea to talk to an accountant or experienced preparer like H&R Block. Either way, returns are backed up heavily and not being processed, so you’re likely looking at your stimulus check being a few months out, or on your 2020 return."
stimuluscheck,fojgqbr,t3_g7t8c0,1587820429.0,"I have a feeling that’s at least a good portion of people who are getting the error. People either checked it in error and didn’t know it like your situation, or they checked it, but assume because no one actually claimed them, they were eligible. It would probably be a good idea for anyone who is getting an error like that to open up their transcripts and review it."
stimuluscheck,fojgfzy,t1_fojgdd6,1587820196.0,"Misread that, as I understand it, you did not check the “can be claimed” box on your 2018 or 2019 taxes?"
