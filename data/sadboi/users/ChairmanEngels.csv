As to if he should drop out, I think it comes down to this:

Will his heart attack impact his abilities as a president? I believe the answer is maybe. Yes, it is possible and that is alarming. But it is also possible that his heart stays in check.

Now, If Joe Biden does have a cognitive decline (and yes, I am open to the possibility that he does not, I just find it... somewhat unlikely), it is not a question of whether or not it will impact him. It will. Period. And Donald Trump won’t let this pass in the debates, no matter how many medical documents Joe throws his way. Assuming you’re American, you know better than me that the man doesn’t give a damn about facts and truth.
