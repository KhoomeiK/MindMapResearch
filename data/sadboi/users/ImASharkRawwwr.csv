No clue how to find people like that nearby. Maybe they don't exist, that's actually a soothing thought lol.

I have a couple of movies, shows, anything really that I associate with something painful. It sucks. I just want to enjoy things for what they are. Sorry my head is getting so tired and I'm probably not making much sense, I think I'll try sleeping again.

The song just makes me remember cuddling up to my ex-bf while hes playing and we switched every time someone died and it felt like we achieved something grand and massive since the game is pretty tricky and kind of nihilistic and about ""the purpose of life"" and it really resonated with me.

The other one is Dio - Holy diver, ex-gf was in to hardrock and that song kinda stuck  to me and I can't get it out of my head even though it's not really my genre. Listening to it or humming the melody just feels really sad. I pushed her away so hard.

I just left the session and thought ""that's it, you can't be helped, you need to die."" 0/10 would not recommend."
BPD,fkgyp5v,t1_fkgsfad,1584180898.0,"Haha thanks, I just really like and identify with sharks. They're kinda the lone wolves of the sea, misunderstood and cuddly."
BPD,fkgyn52,t1_fkggzj4,1584180817.0,"That's fair, I think it's really personal preference. I didn't want to go on feeling nothing so I think crying a lot is actually a step in the right direction for me, although a difficult one."
BPD,fkgykx2,t1_fkg8dmg,1584180730.0,"Thanks :) I guess I'm a quiet borderline, I dunno I just get really quiet the worse I feel, it's pretty awkward in social situations which is where I'm usually overloaded with stuff too."
BPD,fkg3tev,t3_fi8336,1584149259.0,"I've done that. I even do that in instant messages when I'm having a meltdown, usually the other person just gets weirded out or doesn't know what to say, I honestly don't know what I'm getting out of it either. It's completely unhelpful and self destructive and by the end nobody wants to talk to me - and I feel like ""mission accomplished, achievement unlocked: make everybody hate you just like you deserve"" what the fuck is wrong with me :("
BPD,fkg3jpn,t3_fi7w2f,1584149073.0,"Awesome :) sounds like a nice chat, you got this!"
BPD,fkg3dl9,t1_fkfuwqa,1584148954.0,Sounds weird but I think I have it too! It's like a weird mix of dejavu and knowing exactly what happened a long time ago (too long to remember when exactly) - but then it happens in front of me and I get really anxious. Hasn't happened too often but enough for me to notice. Wonder what's causing it 🤔
BPD,fkg32yu,t3_fi8fuf,1584148748.0,"No matter how bad I've been feeling, when I sit down with a therapist everything just fades away from my active mind lol. It's like ""nothings wrong why would anything be wrong"" and after the session I'm kicking myself for not saying the truth yet again. I guess I'm just stupid that way"

Art,fkek8f4,t1_fkejgyh,1584114903.0,We'll get them eventually!
Art,fke48k4,t3_fhxxdg,1584104754.0,I just want to hug each one of them 🤗
BPD,fkcoujz,t1_fkclnug,1584057761.0,"You're writing down my own thoughts, I'm with you on everything you feel and wrote. The worst imo is people trying to fix you like a pet project, a broken down bike that just needs to be reinflated and everything is suddenly fine... but they just can't accept that it doesn't work like that.

I have no solutions to offer except: do what helps. I'm getting drunk all the time, abusing my pain meds, cutting, I'd take any drugs I could find if I knew anyone with access. It's not healthy but it's necessary to keep myself from doing something worse. Sorry I'm not much help. :( Going through this too."
BPD,fkclku4,t3_fhgk3r,1584055693.0,"Are you me? Childabuse and concussion around the same time, drugs & alcohol but not being an addict - just need to stop the feelings sometime. 

I've been with 4 therapists and two psychiatrists and countless doctors who did absolutely nothing for me. One ""forgot"" to hand me over to a colleague when she stopped working and the last one didn't know what to do with me. They just keep passing me off to the next ""specialist"" and keep trying medications that fuck me up more until something works? After 6 different meds I noped out of there. I'm not saying this will happen to you, I think I'm cursed or just extremely unlucky or the way my condition & life is set up makes me more likely to get the wrong diagnosis and that people don't take it serious because I'm a pro at faking it. The one thing I feel could help me on multiple issues is cannabis... but it's still illegal here and getting it medicinally is out of the question. FML

Sorry, this kind of turned in to a rant. Bad month. :("
BPD,fkckf6g,t3_fh2moy,1584054974.0,"I feel like I've been to war and lost, my body just gives up."
BPD,fkcjvpp,t3_fhgbp2,1584054643.0,"I feel that way, really strongly and negatively, about child abuse - which is in the news all the time, thank got not so much in movies or shows. It's a weird mix of absolute hate for people who do that shit and that nobody wrote about it when it happened to me. Fuck those people."
BPD,fkcjeu3,t3_fhgudl,1584054351.0,"Hell yes, you do! I hope to have that realization at some point too but for that I'd need to actually *be something* by myself instead of being a chameleon and just giving people what they want. :("
BPD,fkcj6lp,t3_fhina1,1584054207.0,"I suddenly started crying whenever I was laughing really hard. It's like a switch that flips over; watching a comedy that I really enjoy and bang I'm on the floor/bed drowning in my own tears unable to even get up. For no reason(?) I have no clue why this started happening, what's the cause?? \*slowly going crazy with this disorder\*"
BPD,fkcirw9,t3_fhgdzt,1584053959.0,"I guess maybe positivity posts get more traction because people like to feel good and sharing positivity might help someone to feel better - whereas sharing negativity can trigger people, make them feel worse. Both are still valid posts, you're allowed to vent and allowed to feel bad and if venting helps you - please do so!

Something I did before was to write out a vent, submit it and then delete it two hours later because nobody was voting or commenting and I just felt like nobody cares or people don't agree and I feel even more like an outcast. Fuck that, no more. I vent if I have to, even if it's just screaming in to the void somebody might read it some day and say ""I totally agree"" lol. All feelings are legit. 

Also I really feel you on the relationship trigger. Ever since I broke up I've been hyper-sensitive for relationships, PDA and even when strangers are just walking down the street holding hands. [This meme](https://external-preview.redd.it/QYnjiqVS_zxjNHj-2UHG85XsxhT4x-WVSCzlQo_m7KE.jpg?auto=webp&s=69c3f7c678e7486cfea9e7a341b6196c88a6d819) describes my feelings somewhat, it's really petty but that's what it is. I've been burned by every relationship I've been in so far, why do I get hurt, why do I deserve so little? And choosing to be single is the single most excrutiatingly mind-numbing thing; I cannot stand feeling alone and breaking up was such a huge mistake... but it had to be one. People are bastards."
BPD,fkchdo6,t3_fhmxim,1584053115.0,All the time. And then I apologize for being obnoxious about this and that just makes it worse and awkward.. ugh.
BPD,fkch9dy,t3_fhm3vp,1584053045.0,"There are a few songs that can get me to cry on queue but I associate something insanely beautiful with them. There's a soundtrack of a video game that I used to play with my (ex) bf back then and it was a really good time and I felt really safe and secure - remembering that (loosing it, maybe never having that again) just returns me to a pile of crying goop and I actually try to avoid it."
