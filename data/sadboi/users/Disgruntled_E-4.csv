People get paid more but all of the costs associated with the cost of production of the goods also increase. Or people cut their hours. Combine the two and increase the tax rates and everything becomes really expensive. That's what is happening in California. If you could lower minimum wage, and cut taxes the cost of goods would drop drastically and employment would increase. However the government would be providing less stuff to the people. The Government could then reduce size again meaning possibly more tax cuts. And more money in the economy and also increasing the buying power of the money. This all creates a stronger economy with prices that more accurately reflect the value of the goods. Hopefully that explains stuff better. On the economic side anyway."

Some of the NCO and SNCO corps is failing at looking out for the welfare of their Marines or is even being toxic and causing harm to their Marines. At the same time some Marines just got put in an environment that's toxic to them. When I first enlisted I had an 0311 contract and it got over sent having a last name at the end of the alphabet I got moved to 0621 and I am ok at communications but I get less rifle time now than I did as a civie. At my current unit I am almost completely useless in garrison but when I get sent to the field I become an excellent Marine simply because the field is a better environment for me. Working odd hours and being sleep deprived make me feel stronger better. I enjoyed the ""stress"" of MCT and was excellent at hikes. Some are finding out that the Marine Corps they heard about growing up from family members  is gone.  I heard stories from uncles and my grandfather of  the Marine Corps being difficult as recruits would be beat and embarrassed and I looked forward to that abuse as it was very similar to my home life. Instead I got put in the MAW and I discovered that its run more like a corporation than a warrior culture. Then there's the PC civilian culture that is taking its toll on our standards as junior Marines can't say whats truly on their mind or jokes to their peers even if it is inappropriate for fear of being reported to leadership as a sexist, misogynist, or homophobe.  All of this is bottling up inside Marines as there's no way to let it out as most combat deployments are going away to the Army. Because the majority of my Marines enlisted to be violent towards America's enemies and to keep the bad people at bay. Hell there's no duking a disagreement out anymore as its not favored by the leadership as a way to settle issues. Then there's the tattoo uniform and height and weight policy and Marines like their tattoos, rolled desert sleeves, and lifting weights but the way height and weight is taken some are put on BCP even though they bench 300 because they can't run."

Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf developed TCP/IP on Jan. 1 1983. TCP/IP is an communications model that set standards for how data could be transmitted between multiple networks. from there researchers began to assemble the ""network of networks"" that became the modern internet. Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web which is different and often confused with the internet itself. the web is just the common means of accessing data in the form of websites and hyperlinks. the concept dates back to the 40s when MITs J.C.R. licklider popularized the idea of an intergalactic network and early computer scientists  developed THE CONCEPT of ""packet switching"".

We are where we are because of toxic leadership. people who shouldn't still be in are in and they kicked out the 1's who are warriors and leaders. the US military is a force for good. in the past century we have fought and ended Nazism, confronted the murderous communists in east Asia, provided aid in foreign nations that have been wrecked by national disasters, stood up to war lords and terrorists across the globe, removed tyrants and freed multiple nations under said tyrant's rule, we have freed hostages, and created some of the most important technological advances known to man(internet, medical). yes at times we stood by while countries broke down into chaos and genocide and we live in regret of those decisions to stand down.
