Only reason I revisited this PERIODT is cause I saw you were still coming for homegirl, and I stick up for my ladies . If you check my post history you can see I'm actually a really sweet positive person, and I wouldve shown you the same love and support I show everyone else in the world but you prefer to be a bitter, projecting asshat and that's why your miserable && I have a special place in my heart for telling dumb ass brock Turner ass white men that they're shitbags when its deserved.  You remind me of my piece of shit ex . So hurt inside and just spewing negativity . Holding onto anger is like holding a hot coal, it only burns you . Where has all your negativity gotten you this weekend ? Yeah honey, I pity the fuck out of you.

Its scary that he pretty much just started using it- often times people aren't ready to quit.  This reminds me of my own story, I wanted a better life, my ex claimed to want a better life and then did nothing to get any better and kept using . I would try to help him kick it and then wake up to my debit card and car being gone, making my fuck it's kick in because if he used my money to buy dope why shouldnt I use it? Eventually I went to treatment and I have a few years clean now. My ex is dead. Along with every single person I used with on a daily basis. No shit dude, even the heroin addicts I got close with in treatment are all dying. If you truly want to save your brothers life you might wanna try a different tactic than just self medicating. Also, remember you are not just helping your brother get clean you are saving his life .

I'd recommend lots of anything that would help you sleep, magnesium is good for RLS, really just set aside like 3 days for the worst of it and try to sleep the whole time. Everyone recommending suboxone is in my opinion, wrong. That's trading a small addiction for a massive one that you might honestly never stop tbh.

The longer you use any kind of opiate you're just making it longer/harder on yourself."
OpiatesRecovery,fnhbk45,t3_g1mk1m,1586959211.0,"Getting clean is NOT easy or pretty. I'm the same age as you and I've been clean for a little over two years and there was a time period where I thought i would NEVER have the strength to do it, my sole existence was shooting dope and hustling. All my friends are dead. 3 of my exes are dead. Your nonexistent energy and all the chemical shit WILL return to normal you WILL be able to function it just takes your brain time to even back out. I have a super addictive personality as well, heroin, coke, meth, xanax, you name it I'd try to cook it in a spoon and shoot it. The drugs were never my problem, my problem was trying to use chemical comfort to deal with my issues. If you deal with your issues you won't want to use. I recommend tapering the tramadol down as low as you can and then forcing yourself through withdrawal with comfort meds, imodium is ESSENTIAL for detox, and when you're able to find a therapist. If you get clean now you only have to go through withdrawal once, they tell you in treatment that you can have life beyond your wildest dreams if you get clean, and that shits true. I used to spend ever day wishing I would die and now I wouldnt trade my life for the world. Best of luck to you xx"
OpiatesRecovery,fnhadte,t1_fngya3d,1586958519.0,At a treatment center I was at (for PTSD so not for straight addiction) they gave this older woman subs to get her off tramadol and she would straight up nod out in meetings and groups all the time.
