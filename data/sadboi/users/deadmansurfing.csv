britishcolumbia,ezmx4qy,t3_d1d16p,1567998076.0,"I worked mapping the province a while ago and I've been just about everywhere. It's spectacular but believe me there are bleak bits beyond anything in Ontario; miles of clearcuts, beetle kill and forest fire damage not to mention all the lost old growth forest."
IRLgirls,eye3vpc,t3_cwm3ny,1567028452.0,This doesnâ€™t look real
depression,ey6lbki,t3_cvmbzg,1566858277.0,"Yes, as a compromise with the big sleep."
motorcycles,exmn5l9,t3_ctih1x,1566435668.0,Kind of a short list. No chance of payola though.
XR650L,euswda3,t1_eurx26z,1564014894.0,"Thanks man! This is better and worse than I imagined. From the sound of it, it will be worth the effort for the performance. Apparently they have two versions available at the moment, a red one and another (either white or raw?)."
XR650L,euruvzv,t1_euqzz41,1563999277.0,"This is what I guessed. I suspect it's just a small operation working out of a garage.

Could I ask you take a closer pic showing the installation and what it looks like on the rider side? Was it hard to fit? Thanks for the info!"
XR650L,euqzbzk,t1_euown39,1563987461.0,"Yeah. That's where I saw it. But the site appears dead. You place an order, they send a followup email saying they'll come up with a price and nothing happens. Your experience I guess?"
XR650L,euovtcw,t3_c1f9zc,1563947647.0,Yep. New cable. Not expensive.
XR650L,euovn5e,t3_c3w4oa,1563947572.0,I like it. Where did you get it?
XR650L,euovhey,t3_c8hqu5,1563947494.0,"Nice. I have a 2008, not as clean with around 25k miles. Runs fine. De-smogged, airbox opened. Better bars. Clunky junk off back taken off. Thinking of selling. What should I ask?"
XR650L,euouueo,t1_euoncjo,1563947220.0,"I'm 6'2"" and it's fine for me but I'm inclined to agree. I think someone even an inch shorter will find it awkward. That said, a lot of shorter people do ride them and they must be used to a world with stuff made for bigger people. I don't think it's a shorter girl's bike at all unless she's a pro and even then."
