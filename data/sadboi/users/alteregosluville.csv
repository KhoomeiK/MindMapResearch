The tradition started because my brothers and I are adopted and Christmas Time was a sad and shameful thing. We didn’t get gifts, or see family. We stayed home while 6 of the other kids got to go visit their grandparents, uncles, aunts, ect. ( my brothers and I are are the only ones adopted , so the other 6 went to the same grandparents house for holidays. It was a huge thing for them. ) So us adopted kids started to go to place to eat for dinner on Christmas Eve. Years later, their grandparents passed away so they just don’t like seeing their family that much, so how they all go to the restaurant instead. Which is fine. It was fun for a long time. I just can’t handle being around my adopted mother. She makes me feel so small and gross. I second guess my own thoughts. I can’t really be myself around her. It took me so many years to cut her out of my life. She’s not fucking sending a group text to everyone saying “please don’t let the tradition die!” Im just not 16 anymore and I refuse to let her control me.
