teenagers,fpcg6iw,t1_fpbx1rq,1588499387.0,"You can have my ADHD. I have luck that I have ADHD instead of autism. But it still linked me to other things like depression, anxiety, dislexie and suicidal thoughts. And people assume that I am 'normal', but just a bit busy in the head and energetic even though I am the inattentive type. 

It's not for nothing a disorder, but nobody sees that, because it all happens in the head. So people keep stacking expectations you can't reach. So you fail, have a panic attack and have to go on with life again. Because your not done with all your given tasks. This all feels like a failing circle that never ends.

But, I see ADHD as the lighter version of autism or bipolar and I have respect for people who can kick life's ass with them.

If you feel like you can't reach your full potential, but blame yourself and maybe beat yourself up for it, you can always do your research or be tested."

I am medicated with ritalin, and I am seeing a therapist. At the moment we're mostly focusing on ADHD symptoms and failure anxieties.

I don't really know how I would describe my cooping mechanism(not to good I think). 

I think the combinations of procrastinating, feeling less motivated, afraid I can't do it and getting stuck so much because my learning disabilities holds me down so much.

Today because of these comments and the lockdown that just began because coronavirus. I sit down and learn as much as I can take from tutorials. I will start every day with a hour long tutorial. And then try if I can throw it at my school(college) projects. 

This way I hopefully fight with succes my learning disabilities or atleast level up my game. I am also learning out school books and I will buy more books on this and other topics to fight dislexie.

Somebody else said that I should do it because it's fun and do it till it's not fun anymore. I will also do everything one day at the time because that's something I now have enough of because the lockdown:)."
