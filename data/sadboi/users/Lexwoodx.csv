Cutters,f6mojv1,t1_f6mnf5j,1572976117.0,"
I was like you for a long time, until I finally broke down and told my parents. (my parents aren’t very mental health aware and think that people with depression are just lazy and dramatic but they’re getting better now that I’ve opened up to them).

I can’t tell you to go and tell your parents but it definitely is helping me and I think you’d be surprised at how willing parents are to spend money on things like councillors for example, my family don’t have a lot of money and my parents just got me a councillor (private not NHS) and it’s £50 a session."
Cutters,f6mipts,t1_f6mhxkl,1572973683.0,Yeah! It’s hard to make yourself feel better when you feel shit about having the feelings in the first place and when you feel like you don’t have the right to own them.

OCPoetry,f5nlb50,t3_dofsrn,1572301485.0,"Amazing poem with good rhymes, the poem has a silky smooth read to it. 

But I also think it’d be more effective without the last line. 

The 2nd last line is punchy and hitting where as the last line stops the hard hitting ending and makes it smooth again which almost makes it seem as if it fizzles out at the end."
OCPoetry,f5njl3d,t3_dnwege,1572300883.0,"This poem is amazing, I found my myself lost in the words and physically taking in a deep breath each time it said “I breathe”. 

The structure is simple but very effective and empathises the almost morbid or heady feel to the poem.  

Not only does your poem spark emotions, it’s really powerful in the sense that at the start you think that it’s going to be reasons not to live but they’re actually reasons too live. 

The only thing I would say is I’m not sure if you mean to have the reasons to live come off so heavy and sad or if you’d rather them be naturally read in a more uplifting tone (if that makes sense) but I think it’s still effective either way, just depends on your intention."
