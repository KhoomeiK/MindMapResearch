Starblastio,feko8k8,t1_fek4f5i,1579204167.0,">As u/CarmeTaika said above, ""raising a stronger team"" and ""using better strategy"" are among your options.

You place so little thought in what you say its entertaining tbh. The matches in team mode are random, no one knows when a team or clan will be playing. If I see a clan rampaging there is no way quickly call in my ""stronger"" team in time to fight them. And if all I did was play with friends I would just be doing the same as them, rampaging because my clan would 10/10 be better than a team with randoms. The only time your ""git gud"" strategy works is during ACW, the date is known so you have time to assemble a squad to fight other clans.
