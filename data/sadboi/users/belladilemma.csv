After watching this weeks episode, I’ve decided I’m going to make the cut but maybe after the season finale. I’ve felt this inkling for awhile but personally, this currant season resembles nothing of what the Greys I know and love is. 

I felt perhaps I’ve being to critical? But honestly ... honestly what is going on right now / NOTHING. There is no emotion attached to this show anymore."
