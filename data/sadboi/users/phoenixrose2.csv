MercyThompson,fq0ikc0,t1_fq05viy,1589032386.0,"The fact that Warren survived for SO LONG as a solo gay werewolf demonstrates his level of dominance. Also, Darryl is no pushover and Adam judging him to be an alpha in his own right and that Adam’s opinion that Darryl was potentially a problem/chafing at being a second demonstrates that Darryl really is up there-but until I do a full re-read of A&O, I wouldn’t be willing to put him as 8th. I think the NW city’s pack Alpha we ran into was pretty dominant-and then that SW female made/forced change with witch blood is a potential Force. If memory serves... I tend to do a full series re-read prior to reading new releases, but there aren’t as many A&O books. :-)

As for ranking Mercy above Adam, dominance is defined as the drive to protect others-if I’m not mistaken? As Aurielle (sp?) points out in Smoke Bitten, Mercy does not only protect pack. She protects her friends-vampires, fae, humans. Furthermore, she was the one who declared the pack would defend their territory on her own.  She has, on numerous occasions, demonstrated tremendous determination to save others-at the cost of her own safety-frequently placing her own life on the line. Isn’t that the job of an alpha?

Adam supports her, agrees with her, and provides her with the tools she needs as best as he can-but in the end,  she brings to the table, and utilizes far more than what he offers. 

Furthermore, Adam’s orders, and even Bran’s, orders roll off her. She fakes submission. Like Warren does to Darryl. This was established in Moon Called."
MercyThompson,fpy7umh,t1_fpy4tst,1588997940.0,Lmao!! YUP! That is the scene. So many fans wrote about grieving for it. So happy with Patty’s choice.
MercyThompson,fpy7r32,t3_g6c2tn,1588997877.0,"I really feel like this is a build up book. I strongly disagree with others in this thread. I believe Ms. Briggs’ writing is as delightful and fresh as ever. I am SO PUMPED to see what will happen with Underhill and Beauclaire/the fae. I found Zee creating an artifact to be quite exciting. 

I’m still thrilled that Wulfe is actually a white witch in addition to a wizard and a vampire, he really is an ace in the pocket as an ally, and arguably he has been on Mercy’s side since book 2. (I don’t recall him being in book 1-please remind me if he was and I’ll have to delay some professional reads to go back to Moon Called. ;-) )

I love how much time was spent in Mercy and then Adam’s “other” place. And how all those different forces of power interacted in those areas. 

I honest to goodness wonder STILL about the fact that David and Adam were turned in Vietnam when supposedly there were no werewolves there. But perhaps an earlier poster was correct, and Elizavetka gave Adam a new form entirely that had not been buried there from his transition-one that can help him switch far more quickly, and that is far more deadly, and that Mercy can help tame. 

I did find it suspicious that Adam is jealous of Bran... Does he know what Anna and Charles know???

Finally, YAY!!!! WALKING STICK!!!!!"
MercyThompson,fpy54rs,t3_gg29vr,1588996209.0,"I’m late to the thread, and lots of people have already provided great answers. 

I think it is important to remember that when werewolves are close, we don’t *really* know until lives are on the line. 

Darryl would never have known Warren was faking submission to him if it weren’t for Darryl not being able to control Warren when Warren was healing in (if memory serves) book 2. 

Is Asil more dominant than Adam? We will probably never know by canon. I can’t imagine Ms. Briggs putting them in that sort of situation. 

My best guess is:
1. Bran
2. Charles
3. Samuel 
4. Asil
5. Mercy
6. Adam
7. Warren

It’s been a few years since I’ve re read the Alpha and Omega series, so apologies if I’m missing anyone. I do wonder about the young girl who went to Bran. She will likely be up there."

This is affecting Black Americans disproportionately, and due to SES, they are frequently the ones who are having to work the front lines -delivering packages, groceries, etc. and having pre-existing conditions that make people more vulnerable for COVID to take a more serious turn. I am just frustrated because people who are asymptomatic and or have privilege, don’t recognize that they are putting others’ lives at risk. And galavanting around just because the weather is nice...

Also? Ecuador at sea level, has cases breaking out-so heat will not kill it. And the Spanish Flu came back, those with immunity from the first round did not have immunity from the second, far more deadly,  strand.
