timex,fj8fe61,t3_faloqn,1583112129.0,Love it! Re-release or original?
mentalhealth,ff0fyq0,t1_feyes8m,1579468546.0,I identify very much with this statement.
HomeImprovement,ff0exzt,t3_eqrkpl,1579468251.0,40 yo guy here. My beautiful 29 year old wife is way handier than me and I'm totally cool with it. Just sayin'...
GamerPals,fdf9rdg,t1_fdc8kho,1578356619.0,Definitely interested. My add code is 365599900 on steam.
GamerPals,fdc3zuc,t3_ekjks5,1578266658.0,"Dude, if you were into Halo 1-3 have you tried MCC for PC, specifically Reach? It’s pretty awesome.... buckets of nostalgia for me going back to playing Halo CE in ‘01 with one of my best buds.  Nice too since my aging rig can run it in ultra wide 1440 and it’s smooth as butter :)."
CanadaPolitics,es5e8kt,t1_es48wqt,1561608984.0,"I wish I could upvote this comment a million times. EXACTLY. Chill. The Fuck. Out People. I voted for Trudeau but I also voted for Harper twice and Brad Wall in my own province. Instead of the divisive rhetoric how about looking carefully at the issues and having civil, constructive discussions with people you disagree with. This BS helps no-one."
CanadaPolitics,es5aiav,t1_es45huh,1561605814.0,A bit harsh bro. Not sure I agree with the point but I hardly think he was endorsing genocide either.
