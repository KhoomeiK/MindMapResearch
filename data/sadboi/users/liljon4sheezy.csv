bipolar2,fqshiqz,t1_fqp157w,1589607433.0,i really like it so far it’s helped w my anxiety and helped me be more clear headed and actively partake in daily activities. so i say it’s doing its job! and idk if it’s the latuda but since i’ve upped my mg i’ve been sleeping better? haha

bipolar2,fqnlai8,t1_fqnjqhl,1589496898.0,hi yes you can! safe space here. so i often experience hypomania and it’s calmed down since i’ve taken medication increasingly but i still have had times where i have it. considering what i’ve gone through (what we’ve all gone through) i give it a lot of credit. i feel like i would’ve been worse off if i weren’t on it. but this is the first medication that i feel better on and not “crazy”

bipolar2,fqmybrx,t1_fqmxjob,1589485570.0,"i’m on 100 mg and 40 mg! IT IS ODD ISNT IT?? i’m on 5 and a half months now and if u even have two minutes to find out what it’s helped me go through itd be amazing. pandemic, my parents being patient 0 and 1 in our county and have to self quarantine a month before things got serious, keep my life a secret for that month until news and press made corona a bigger deal. my brother died three weeks ago from fentanyl related drug over dose that his best friend of 40 years gave him. weeee doing a police investigation and waiting for toxicology report. (my brother never does drugs and he owns a business we think his friend turned on him to get all his assets bc everything is in the friends name!!!) we have a whole new family moving in with us this week. i just basically adopted his two children and am juggling all the responsibilities rn and i can whole heartedly say that my medication saved my life this year. it’s giving me exactly what i need to carry on with this fucked up year. being diagnosed was the best thing to happen to me."

BPD,fpz0qk3,t3_gg181s,1589011388.0,ahhh i used to do this when i was dating. i wonder if i learned better or if i just don’t have the opportunity to do it. don’t feel bad about the decision you made in a tough moment and don’t feel ashamed for trying to cover it up. Instead try to actively realize that you need to take care of yourself. i used to pretend to play hospital and nurse myself back. then i’d have little secret victories with myself.. made me feel better after a “moments mistake.” you’re not alone this is definitely relatable! sending you virtual hugs! hoping you realize you’re being thoughtful and mindful rather than manipulative!

Instagramreality,f7eahks,t1_f7e0ejb,1573652292.0,exactly my point. sorry the 50 + people were too daft to understand that botox freezes muscles so you’re unable to move. people get injected above their upper lip sometimes when they get lip filler. smh sometimes this community just wants to hear what they want to hear and not what’s true

LushCosmetics,etqo8g4,t3_ccwbh9,1563094467.0,exactly the reason why i left Lush! found my passion for skincare and became an aesthetician instead. loved the training and experience at Lush and will always cherish it but the pay was humiliating considering how much time and effort i was putting into my job there.  I truly believed everything i was being fed there until i sat down and realized my skills were more appreciated and better utilized elsewhere. best of luck and i will definitely continue to fight ur fight w u xxx
