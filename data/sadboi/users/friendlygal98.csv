therapy,fqryy01,t1_fqq55vx,1589594885.0,I second this. With quarantine I caught myself doing it more often and I immediately used the techniques I learned in therapy. These intrusive thoughts can easily creep on you and become more intense if not treated.
decaf,fqrxqxs,t3_gkm2jn,1589594148.0,"Hi ! Interesting question. I don't think it's so much the caffeine but more the need to have a ''high''. Sometimes I feel down or moody and feel the need to react to the feeling by spending, eating something sweet or taking a coffee. But I've learned to accept to simply let it pass like any other feeling. Just my two cents :)"

Anxiety,flyjruo,t3_frubvt,1585603465.0,"As to anxiety, I think I can't offer you any advice that hasn't been said in these comments. As for displaying emotions and trying to connect to your family: I've been there and it's incredibly stressful and you feel vulnerability. For me what helped is to just say the words: Hey, can we watch a movie together? 

This sentence will feel like you're dying and panicking inside, but I just focus on just saying the words, like rehearsing it in my head and saying it. There's no other way to do it! They are your family and they love you !"
Anxiety,flyj00z,t3_frslfn,1585603048.0,"Yes, quarantine has really spiked my anxiety. I think you're doing what I used to do, I'm in no ways an expert,: Mind reading and hypervigilance. Mind reading is when you're thinking you know what their thoughts are, but you're not. Only this person know what he or she's thinking about : You have to trust that this person likes you. Hypervigilance is when you overanalyze the person's voice, body language and tone to try to see if he's mad, to avoid displeasing or try to predict. You have to trust that your friends likes you, in most cases they do because they are your friends, and enjoy the good times you have with them. You deserves to enjoy your time. I hope my experience helped. If you want to talk I am here ! Best of wishes."

antidepressants,ffy81t2,t3_evty6d,1580340371.0,"I think its because we're so used to feeling shitty and its scary to move forward. What if it won't work ? We're also very comfortable in our old ways. Recovery takes time and its not a straight line. I was fine for 1 month and then all of a sudden i'm a ball of anxiety because i've put too much pressure on myself.

Your mental health comes first and its important to have a healthy mind to ""confront"" everyday life. When you're used to your mental illness, it can be difficult to understand which tought stems from your mental illness and which tought comes from you. After therapy and medication for anxiety, i could tell what i really wanted and trust my gut more. I hope my vision helped op !"

Anxiety,fbdeyiz,t3_eco8ug,1576759999.0,"I'm also like this ! However, i've listened to a episode about meditation and they talk about the ""monkey mind"" where your mind goes crazy before going into meditation because it has no distraction. I tend to think about my anxiety in the night as my monkey mind and try to meditate. Seeing it as something separate helped me not giving in to my toughts that stem from anxiety. Like no friendlygal, you don't need to check your credit score now at 10 pm, sleep it off girl.

I hope it helped !"

antidepressants,f8ol8gk,t3_e1er2y,1574685050.0,"I'm sorry that happened to you, abuse from a trusted one is shit, i've been there. 
I dont think the meds supress your emotions, more like ""regulate"" them. I think you might supress those yourself instead of confronting them. I think trauma and ptsd, if you have it, is complex and needs help from a proper therapist. 

I think the meds just help you cope for the moment while you look for a long term solution, you shouldnt feel guilty for feeling better than what you expect !

Best of wishes, you can pm me if you want to talk about it and share experiences."
