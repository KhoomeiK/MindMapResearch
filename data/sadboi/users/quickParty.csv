Anyways, a tip that I feel no one in the FA community talks about is Apetamin. It is a vitamin syrup for allergies or something, with the main side effect being an endless pit of a stomach. 

Apetamin is popular on YouTube and shit for girls trying to get ‚Äòthick.‚Äô Warning, the first day or two, it knocks you out, take it on a Friday night  for the first time, and you will sleep hard. After the first day or two, no more drowsiness. 

Take 10-15ml like 20-30 minutes before eating, and you will have no limit. It‚Äôs actually crazy. Use it around stuffings and stuff. It has a pleasant taste, and is easy to take. The bottle recommends 10-15ml 3 times a day, but i would just use it anytime you know you want to consume a lot, so it last longer, as bottles are like $20 each. The hunger affect last for several hours in my experience. 

Purchasing it is odd. The two times I have purchased, (x3 bottles each time), first was from some small gym in NY, and the second time was from someone local who sold it on OfferUp. 

Look it up, give it a try, whatever.

Another tip, set a goal, like try to maintain 5k calories a day or something. Find a number that works for you. 

Lastly, I‚Äôm a big fan of rapid growth, but in reality, gaining happens slower than you would expect (unless it‚Äôs just me), so be patient and enjoy the journey. 

Oh and bonus tip. WEED. Smoking a little will go a long way lol. Take a hit, pig out and watch some reruns.
