EatingDisorders,fpzyucb,t3_ggd3kb,1589025686.0,"First of all, you should be proud for being concerned about this - you are right that it could manifest into something really damaging! The labels don't matter much- what I mean is, whether or not this is ""X eating disorder"" or perhaps just ""disordered eating"" -- it's all about taking care of yourself and whipping the problem before it becomes a life habit.

It's not easy to ""Whip"" The problem, believe me I understand. But, by seeking support where you can get it, I think you'd be really proactive and able to contain this before it becomes a much larger hurdle.

1. If you are 15, then you are in school, and based on your writing being awesome, I have a feeling you are very smart and probably go to a great school. I would bet that you have a counselor on staff that can talk to you about all sorts of things. (Not an ""Academic"" counselor, but a counselor-counselor, one who is licensed in mental health/well-being.)
2. If not, then I am also sure your parents - if they work - have access to great health care or resources.  Talk to them about this concern. Your Dad is really sweet, he is trying to help soothe your feelings and categorize them as similar to his, but in reality -- yours may be something bigger or more troubling. That's not to make you worry, but you need a real professional to help you analyze this and figure out what steps to take.
3. We can't diagnose you, but based on what you wrote, it seems like binge eating to me, which is marked by certain traits, like:
   1. Eating in secret, especially foods that are super tasty""Treat"" foods. 
   2. Eating very rapidly, to push down the feelings of ""awareness"" -- so that you won't have to stop, but can keep eating without really thinking about it.
   3. In that process, feelings about other things that are worrisome (whatever in life might be stressful or on your mind) -- become faded while you are eating -- so that you can forget those things for the time being.  (numbing them out.)
   4. After, the guilt sets in and it's just like ""I'm never doing that again....gross...."" etc -- but then before you realize it, it's happening.

If that sounds familiar, then please talk to a professional counselor. It doesn't have to be something that you accept or continue to do! One thing I know is helpful is to eat things you love, in the open, and not in secret -- and don't try to eat less on purpose. Try to eat what you know will satisfy you, and you're a teenager  -- eating is kind of a big job for you to grow properly and stay healthy!!

I hope this helps - you're brave, to me. <3"

Don't even worry about WHY he is not hungry - who cares? it has nothing to do with you or your level of hunger.

For now, if he is at a normal weight, I think it is best that you support him as others have said below - and save a confrontation for a real intervention if and when the need arises (he gets to a severely low weight - it is unmistakable to see this when it happens, you will know - which I pray is not ever the case).   

Consider getting support for just you alone - this is NOT your fault nor is it your responsibility to fix him.

I had an NG tube for about 4 weeks...it went in SO painfully - hurt like hell, so much so that I instantly burst into tears (I was 44 at that time, I'm 45 now).  It was sore for about 1 week, but then it magically got comfortable.

I tried Cepacol lozenges that they had on hand, which helped, but there wasn't much except hot tea that would soothe it -and I'm not a fan of hot tea when it had no sugar, etc.  (Ah, to be at treatment where everything is regulated!!)....

You'll be A-ok. Just hang in there - and tell your caregivers how you're feeling - they will try to help you as best they can. NG tubes are so helpful because it's VERY difficult to ingest all the calories some people need in order to put weight on steadily - this will help you when you are out of treatment and want to eat normally....(if you get used to eating the MASSIVE amounts of calories required in weight-gain phase, it could be hard to dial it down to normal later...this was what sold me on the NG tube. Plus it's much faster than eating the calories entirely. HUGS)

I am a person who has had an ED since the year 2004, and I just got treated for it finally in 2018...my DH and my entire family did an intervention, and it was the best thing that could have happened. I was VERY low weight, skeletal, and I did not initially begin that way. It all began because of just wanting to be healthy - eating right, exercising.

The thing is, you are not going to change her -- but you can offer her a chance to get treatment (once this covid stuff gets calmer) -- and it would be the best gift you could give her. Changing who YOU are to accommodate her is no different than you modeling poor behavior to appease her - for example, if every time she felt guilty for not eating, imagine if you opted not to eat to be solidly supportive of her.

Yes, not exercising isn't akin to not eating, but exercise is not the culprit. Nor is food, nor are ""Diets"". The culprit is her fear of food, the all-or-nothing mentality, and not channeling her feelings out in a healthy way. This will just continue until she gets help, I'm afraid.

Today, you may just opt out of going to exercise to make her feel better. Next month, it is ""let's not go out to eat together, it makes me feel guilty!""...the month after it's ""I don't want to eat with you at all  - I would rather eat all by myself because I'm embarrassed""...then it's ""I don't eat daily - I eat every other day, and that's how I prefer to be."".....

You cannot force her to get help, but you can make it as appealing as possible and do not neglect to tell her outright - **to implore her** \- that you want to see her get better, that this is causing you grave concern, and you want her to enjoy life fully.  <3  Best wishes, prayers sent."

But on to the real concern: When I started reading your post, I thought that you had a massive amount of insight, so it all made sense when I saw you have conquered your ED, which is also amazing. 

I feel your concerns are so valid; everything you raised is a red flag, especially given the journey he has taken to get to this point. The specific items that stand out to me:

1. He was not always into fitness and low-cal eating.
2. He was once very overweight, which likely made him feel self-loathing for something he felt was out of his hands. (probably never felt he'd lose weight, too difficult, etc)
3. He compensates when circumstances change (i.e. foods are not safe, or exercise not possible)
4. He refuses to listen to your concerns; refuses to recognize the danger of his choices.
5. Is now health-compromised, and unable to change his behaviors (other than to seemingly worsen).

I am in recovery, and while I still struggle with eating ""normally"", I am so much better than I was 2 years ago. I was nearly dead and of very scant weight. My labs, however, were normal - my heart was okay. I had done this for thirteen years, so it was a slow and steady process to get to my skeletal weight. At one time, I was what others may call ""nicely thin"" -- and that may be where your father is now -- but it will just keep going. ED is never satisfied.  I urge you to talk to loved ones about a possible intervention. There are amazing interventionists out there who can help you execute this in love. How I know? it happened to me -- and I took the help - thank God. I am so sorry you are having to take this on, but remember: you must care for yourself first.

You may lose money, yes - but how much money would it take to bring you joy, peace and the ability to take care of yourself? You've put him first for a very long time, and that is so admirable.  However, he has been disrespectful and careless about his own life. He needs to move on, and both of you may end up finding that you love each other more as friends. It isn't easy to give up 33 years by a long shot, but you've tried so hard. You're not giving up - you're just trying to survive. If you live in this stress-zone for much longer, you might be shortening your own life.  

Get some support as other people are recommending, but know that you're valuable and the only way to see change happen is to actually make a change!"

EatingDisorders,flmko23,t1_flkh3og,1585286535.0,"I know this may be unhelpful, but maybe try to see this as a time you can outsmart your ED -- to say ""no, I'm not going to crumble - I'm going to fight harder"".  One thing for sure, this COVID-19 thing is changing how we live, but I'm 99.9% certain you'll have your gym again soon - and wouldn't it be awesome to use this time to flex your recovery muscle? Once you know you can sit successfully through these feelings without having to use behaviors, you'll feel so much stronger. I know that when I challenge myself, I end up being elated that I made it. 

And if it doesn't work perfectly - it is TOTALLY ok. Recovery isn't meant to be perfect, it NEVER is. 

I love my daily walks, and these may also be a great alternative for you. Hang in there, brave person!"

relationship_advice,fkrwrig,t3_fk857s,1584477583.0,"OP, you deserve great big hugs and sympathy - I am so sorry. My H has struggled with it too, and there isn't an easy answer.

One thing you need to know is that porn is addictive; It has physically and emotionally addictive properties, and this is proven scientifically. You can read all about it on this link I'm about to post. I would encourage you to read through the site's resources, and then seek counseling. YOU ARE ENOUGH. It's not your fault. Nothing you did caused him to do this, no matter what people may try to ""sell"" you -- it's not your doing.  He needs help and until he seeks it out, you'll always  have to live with a less-than relationship. The only thing you can control is yourself, which is why you need real counseling from a professional. If you feel your marriage is worth saving, and I would hope that it is, try to see if he can get counseling. Yes, it's hard and humiliating, but any counselor worth two pennies will help him understand that he's not a loser or a pervert. It's just a common pitfall that impedes many, many people - he's not alone.

Divorce,fj6k1lp,t3_fbt4sx,1583073866.0,"This is me!! to a T. Only now, H has finally stepped up and is mature. He is 48. 

Do not think this is on you, although it does indeed mean that you accepted him when he probably was not exhibiting signs of full maturity. When we accept our SO as the flawed people they are, then that means we have to live with their ""warts""  just as they live with ours. BUT: when the warts are not tenable for you, that's where the difficulty lies.

My guess is he was always into his buddies and drinking, and that he never was 100% honest -- just like my H.  

I developed a deadly ED (anorexia) for 13 years to cope. I am now still trying to answer the questions I deferred for many years, except now I'm 45. PLEASE don't be me.

1. Get counseling for you alone.
2. Ask him if he will get counseling. Either alone or as a couple.
3. Find faith or a belief system in your own life - you need this.
4. Don't let him or this situation change your true self. Don't stoop to the levels you think it takes to make him ""hear"" you. That's not effective, even though it's very human.

Is he an engineer, by any chance?  Sorry and hugs - you'll survive. Be strong and clear-minded...try not to let him provoke you."
work,fj4ht3y,t3_fbdgvb,1583008591.0,"First of all, I am sort of mad for you! I think this is ridiculous, and I understand your plight. I too have to work sometimes beyond human capacity, or so it seems.  I support two entirely different areas, so all the items I do for one boss are unseen by the other, and vice versa.

I have been a manager, and I also have had the fortune of working for some awesome companies. What I think would be best for your situation:

1. In a succinct bullet list, list out the tasks you were expected to do in this 15 minute time frame.
2. Explain that you had those items to accomplish, and the very short window, and felt optimistic that you could make this happen because you want to always at least meet - and exceed - their expectations.
3. It seems that you did not have enough time and, in this situation, you realized you made some mistakes:
   1. You accepted an untenable amount of responsibility for such a short window of time.
   2. You didn't have the usual time to do a mental run-through, which is when you'd normally catch an error like missing sign-in sheets.
4. I would then explain that you'd have been happy to try and help determine who attended, and that you'd be willing to help take the burden off of the person who had to figure that out..even now, you'd be willing to help him/her with tasks that they put aside to fix the problem.
5. Going forward, you would like guidance on who can best assist you when time constraints are not going to permit a 100% quality outcome.  In the interim, you'll be sure to ask for help the next time this situation arises.

I know that's a lot, but it can be boiled down to a few points and I think it's both accurate and not unnecessarily self-blaming. Keep us posted!!"
