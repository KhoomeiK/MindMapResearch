100% agree. ITT are a lot of vegans who only see this issue in black-and-white. 

I'm lucky enough that my husband makes enough money that we can afford to eat meat that was more ethically sourced. That hasn't always been the case (I grew up poor as hell for an American).

>  A vegan/vegitarian diet isn't exactly expensive though, the millions of vegitarians in India proves this. 

Apples & Oranges. 

In the US, at this time, many people don't have that option. They live in food deserts. They feed their kids the best food *they can afford.* 

I ate a lot of Spam and Government Cheese as a kid. We ate what the food shelves provided, and supplemented it with ""whatever's on sale"" and ""how many bags a woman with a toddler can carry home in the stroller.""

(Not q good stroller either. One of the cheap ones from the late 70s).

We would have to implement HUGE changes to our culture & economy to match India in this. Which goes back to my previous question:

HOW can we reasonably take the steps to make this happen in a way which causes the least harm (to the most vulnerable humans it effects)?

>PETA are a bunch of self-righteous assholes who pretend to be superior while literally killing thousands to millions of sentient animals each year. The meat industrial complex is worse though

PETA is worse in some ways (e.g., lies & hypocrisy). There is nothing ethical about PETA & they are scamming good people with good hearts into donating to them. 

I have a special hate for PETA. We could hate them together for hours!

>one day people might realize the inhumanity of it, like they did for slavery. (NOT equalising meat industry and slavery at all, just the eventual awareness of people.)

I understand the point you are making, but it seems disrespectful to the people who are *still dealing with the problems created by slavery in America*. I suspect that people around the world living as slaves today wouldn't appreciate it either.

I find it crass. I've seen this argument before, and it tends to make potential allies (especially people of color) very uncomfortable.

Full disclosure - I support Animal Welfare (not animal rights) causes. I also eat meat because my body can't handle a full-veg diet (took me 3 bouts of kidney stones to accept that).

Too many of the stricter pro-Earth & Animal Rights organizations are either too extremist or can't see the forest for the trees. And a lot of that comes from a place of privilege.

One example is GMOs - I agree that Monsanto is bad, but that doesn't make GMOs inherently bad. 

GMO food could save MILLIONS of lives by creating hardy, disease/pest resistant food for the poorest people in the world. Which would, of course, require us to freely provide the seed to those in need. 

A world-wide blanket ban on meat production & animal husbandry would cause great harm to the poor of the world who survive day-to-day - no hunting or keeping chickens for eggs.  

As far as I'm concerned, many animal rights groups are full of privileged people who lack empathy for the poor and struggling. Frankly, they might as well be Republican based on how little they value brown people in developing nations (and in our own communities)."

dresdenfiles,fqhh9gs,t1_fqhesag,1589376962.0,"Hey doc. Sunglass-related question here.

I recently learned that most people bleed red, not purple.

When I was in the hospital, some new doctors transferred me to this weird manor with a medical lab & did a bunch of tests, but wouldn't tell me anything. I snuck out.

Now I'm being chased by these guys in black suits & they are wearing dark sunglasses. At night.

So here's my question:

Isn't wearing sunglasses at night a *fashion don't*, and how should I address this when they inevitably catch me?"

Using insults like this alienates the pro-death penalty crowd, and YOU are making the rest of us look like assholes."
