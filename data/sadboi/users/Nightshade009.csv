I'm looking for someone that takes themselves seriously. Someone who writes and reads alot. Someone who is not easily offended or scared off, by traumatic details and uncommon experiences. Someone I can trust with my content.  I can discuss the content of the memoir in full detail, once contacted. Can you please DM me if your interested. Ideally this could be an on going thing, because this is a work in progress. Hopefully this is a safe place to build this kind of relationship. Thank you."

I uncovered my sheets and my feet dropped to the cold floor. Outside my door was a mirror, where Aida stared into herself, fully dressed by 4:00am. “I never lost the feeling in my breasts,” said Aida, priming her implants before Kelly, her adoring roommate. Her first cosmetic surgery in state custody, was a prized win on behalf of her lawyers. She shared her trophies with the women on the unit, printed nudes she took at her plastic surgeons office.
 At her hills of wanted flesh, she smiled, placing its deep cleavage. Digging with two fingers to pull up the bra’s cups. The bosom too must be ready for the day. Aida was overflowing with skin and privates, covered only because they had to be, adorned in bright colors, like a plastic Picasso of body parts. She smiled at Kelly without averting her eyes from the mirror. She was made more confident by other forces than friendship"

nutrition,ff4r3pe,t3_ercz1y,1579570419.0,"I am currently in a weird housing situation where all my meals are prepared by a staff. I have little to no choice in the meals that are provided. They go shopping for groceries every Tuesday and come back with cheap processed foods for the week. The menu is like chicken nuggets, fish sticks, frozen not fresh chicken, frozen French toast sticks etc. I have an amazon card and they allow me a small space in a cupboard for non - perishables and an even smaller space in the fridge for perishables. I can only have small items. No more than 8 items.

It could be all you need to right the rails. If you’re against medication, you’ll have to achieve a natural lift from depression, which will require your full attention and every effort. I know people hate to hear it, but things like exercise will help, if you’re determined and you let it. But, without medication, it is easier to be taken by an undertow."

It happens all too often within this field. If you’re paying him/her please leave and find someone else, who is worth your time, and ready to take you to new heights. Sadly the biggest culprits of negligence in mental health fields, can often be the treating mental health professionals, who may be in the field for the wrong reasons. I am not saying they are all bad, many can even prove to be great supports. But in my case, I am just used to doing all the heavy lifting. If I could give psychotherapy to myself, I would. You deserve someone who will listen to you with enthusiasm, engage you fully and provide insight. Do not let this guy get away with mediocrity and bulls***! Hope this helps! Xoxo"
