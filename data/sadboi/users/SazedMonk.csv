being an expectation of humanity. It wouldn’t make sense that to be a good human you should be a vegetarian to me. Everything consumes something else.

bipolar,fnn7pbi,t3_g2s20c,1587086226.0,"All the time for me. Everything is blood and gore when I look at people. You need cognitive behavioral therapy CBT. Learn how to understand that your brain is producing, habitually, the same thoughts over and over again. To change these thoughts you have to change what your brain habitually thinks about. Slowly overtime, recognize and remember that you are having a thought you don’t like, and think something else. Something happy. Neurons that fire together wire together. Eventually every time you have a bloody Gory thought you will instantly think something happy, eventually replacing the original thought.

Find a good psychologist that does CBT my friend it’s very helpful.

YOU DO NOT have to believe your thoughts or identify them. They are not you. You are not them. They are nothing more than random images created by a brain with some malfunctions. And that’s okay! We can fix them, slowly. But it’s possible. They are just thoughts, random and created by “not you”. Don’t let them bother you. Just remember you can be any kind of person you want to be and your thoughts don’t have anything to do with it."

I smoke pot most of the day but I’m trying not to. Play video games, read, meditate when I’m able. On my solo days I just sit around the house thanks to covid. The quarantine started a week after the wife and I split so I haven’t quite found my own thing to do like a hobby, for when I’m by myself. I do play guitar a bit too. I have family around which is nice. 

Mostly, the only reason I’m alive, is due to a Buddhist like mindfulness practice. I’ve learned to realize in the moment that my depressive thoughts lead to depressive feelings which lead to depressive actions. I’m working on some CBT with psychologist to help reprogram my auto response to things. So instead of always thinking I wanna kill myself I hate my life this is fucking miserable, I can try to realize that’s not a true statement. I unattached from it. Try to distract myself. And know that it will soon pass as long as I don’t sink into the depression and try to fight it. I hope that helps a little bit. If you like to read I recommend a couple books by a Buddhist Psychiatrist named Mark Epstein.
