Now, I turn to it when I’m happy, it brings me joy, although, sometimes when I listen to certain songs it brings me back to a very lonely time in my life. Regardless, I am so thankful for this album, for this band and everything they have done and continue to do for me."

You have no idea what’s going through someone’s head. One of my closest friends was one of the happiest people I’ve ever met. Always put a smile on faces of others. Yet, he could never keep himself in check but you would never know because he didn’t tell anyone about it. I miss him everyday. Stay strong"
