First off this isnt offensive, at least, im not offended. 
Secondly asexuality is a broad spectrum and diffrent asexuals feel different levels of sexual attraction. Some are sex repulsed and are turned off by the thought of it etc. Others may enjoy sex and just not feel the pull or ""need"" to have sex that sexual people do. This is often seperate from the romantic attraction a person feels. For instance ive had crushes before who i am attracted to and would want to have a relasionship with, but i wouldnt ever want to have sex with them, and if they suggested it i would probably loose interest. Again this is different for different people but i hope u have the general idea. 
Thirdly all asexuals expirience the desire for garlic bread at all times due to its supiriority to all else.

hope this answers your question :P"
