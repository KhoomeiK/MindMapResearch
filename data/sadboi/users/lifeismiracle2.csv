HomeschoolRecovery,fq8l5fw,t1_fq8kte4,1589168773.0,"Thank you. This helps a lot!

Also, I meant as in a podcast could propose solutions as well. I’m on here lurking mostly trying to figure out what I can do to make sure my children aren’t going to look back at this experience and go “I wish it never happened”. If you have a podcast that talks about what really went wrong and what could be done to make it go right, it would be very valuable for homeschooling parents."
HomeschoolRecovery,fq8hpfa,t3_ghet9e,1589166447.0,"I am a mother. I am a special ed teacher. I support public schools but I also see its shortcomings. I chose to stop teaching public schools and homeschool my children. I have a special need child and a child of color who most of the time feel alienated in her classroom because she doesn’t feel like she belongs. I take into account their social needs, their socioemotional learning, their understanding of empathy and equity, and their special needs. I work on class materials during the morning and early afternoon but I allow the kids social time and play time. They have a long lunch because they need it and they usually get overwhelmed in public schools. I encourage them to join social clubs at the local community center and I make them join a group of people in a hobby they like. I want to know, if you’re really against homeschooling, was there anything that could have made homeschooling less hellish for you and others? Out of my own concerns, my children’s needs are not being met at the public school. The evidence is my 6th grader is still performing at a 1st grade level and the school just let them through. The child hates school because they know they’re not learning. But they want to have friends and I want them to have friends. What would really make homeschooling a good experience for a child?"
changemyview,fq5ti5f,t1_fq5ro35,1589117036.0,"I understand having a traumatic experience with a person or a community and staying away from it. I wouldn’t bring shame upon myself for feeling anger and pain and grief. It actually makes the process of grieving much more complicated and drawn out. I have to experience my anger and vent it in a safe environment with people I trust and then let it go. However you handle your own trauma is up to you. I know what works for me and I need it to be ok for me to handle my own grief in ways that help me. 

Do I hate all men and demand their burning? No. Do I go raid the streets and call for violence against men? No. I follow the men’s rights movement rather closely and some fights they put out are worth fighting for and the feminists should listen. I am justifying my moment of grief and anger. I am not justifying systemic abuse against men. As it stands, women in the feminist movement in the US have been making some wrong moves against men and I do not stand behind these actions. I still consider myself a feminist because it’s important to have good feminists setting examples so the bad ones don’t take the lot. There’s variations in every group. It’s not so clear cut and binary."
changemyview,fq5sv2l,t1_fq5mo98,1589116537.0,"We agree on what’s important. I don’t think it does no harm. I think it’s not comparable harm. I think it’s harmful to compare “men are trash” vs “women are trash” because the damage aren’t the same and it’s implicitly assuming that the playing field is leveled. It’s really not. I have followed the men’s rights movement. I think they have a point. I think the arguments are much more nuanced. But then again, saying “not all men” and “all lives matter” completely dismiss the issue that “the majority of men in the patriarchal society cause immeasurable pain, loss, and death of women” and “black lives are dying at the racism of white supremacy”. There is value in a white person and a male presenting person understanding that they are no longer assumed to be the default. They aren’t assumed good and knightly and savior. They are assumed deviant, like the rest of humankind. They must earn trust, like everyone else."
changemyview,fq5l9mg,t3_ggizxx,1589109669.0,"I am a person who say this occasionally. I am a person of color and a queer individual with invisible disabilities. To put it gently, the white people of the United States have not treated me at all fairly. Individuals have so many issues that I cannot forget or forgive, and most of their lack of understanding is based on the fact that they are white and cis het and they don’t take the time to check themselves. Yes, I say these things out of anger and pain and sadness. No I don’t want anyone to take this away from me when I am mourning and grieving. I am still in therapy, still taking medication, still afraid to even dream of a better life because it could all be taken away from me, because I don’t belong, because the message is too clear that they don’t want me alive. I am alive because some days I live out of sheer spite. Everything is already taken away from me. I need it to be ok that I am angry and that sometimes I just want a short grunt “men are trash” and “fuck white people” instead of a dissertation “patriarchy hurts everyone” and “white supremacy is oppressive”. 

There is an implicit bias at play when one says it’s not ok to hate up or hate down. It’s a huge assumption that we’re now on leveled playing field. It’s not ok to say “fuck black people” because black people are already dying every minute because of oppression and saying something like this will reinforce the system that keeps it in place. It’s not ok to say “fuck white people” because white people get offended. White people don’t die more because someone says I hate white people. More black people die because someone says black people are lazy. It’s for very different reasons. 

I don’t expect a reply. I just think you’re trying to understand. My expertise on this mainly comes from my own identities and experiences. I also have taken classes on multicultural education and critical race theory. I am informed and I am not changing my mind. I hope you will one day."

The lack of access to regular hygiene, the constant abuse, the wish for this all to stop. I attempted to run away. I stopped myself and walked back because I couldn’t realistically make sure I can be sheltered and fed. Those were the most basic survival and those are the most basic human needs. Humans will want to die when they’re not given love and care and other needs. But without shelter, food, and water, you will definitely last a much shorter time. I waited and waited and it was traumatizing. I am still recovering. I was able to leave three years ago as an adult but still had to face homelessness.

I’m trying to teach him the ethical thing to do. I can sense that he wants to do the right thing. He just doesn’t seem to be able to feel what the right thing is and understand the emotional implications of how those right things can positively affect others. He’s aware what the right thing to do is. He doesn’t internalize it and really understand why. So sometimes he’d say things like “I’m sorry for hurting you” and he also says things like “killing old people and dead babies jokes are funny” and totally mean both.

It's hard for the child because he can't just explain to me in words that his expressions mean certain things that I don't know. When asked what he needs, he simply says he doesn't know. The more questions and guesses we make, the more frustrated he becomes with us. When we try to break him of whatever obsessions he's into, he feels like all the joy in his day is taken away. He's currently obsessed with car shows which often include remarks that are misogynistic and he's picking that up. With enough online gaming, he's also picking up that killing and talking about violence is funny, but not in a sarcastic way and more in a ""I genuinely think killing people is funny."" It's also really creeping me out. He has thrown things and had physical fights in the past. His upbringing has been pretty normal. He plays with cousins. He had only a few friends but kept losing them and currently have no friends. Mostly he gets into fights in school and school bores him. And yet, he is 3 years behind in his academics.

lonely,flr7f5e,t3_fqgzvz,1585414516.0,"Am a girl who was always afraid that I was too clingy and needy and needed constant reminder that it’s ok to be. 

I want to tell you this. I read lots of people on here telling you that you don’t want a clingy girlfriend. I agree to some extent. I used to be a lot more controlling and manipulative and I didn’t know that I was. To me at the time, I was just anxious all the time that my bf didn’t love me and would leave me at the first chance he gets. I didn’t believe anyone could love me. I don’t know about other people who are needy and clingy, but the cause for all the drama in my relationships was my anxiety that my partner would leave me one day, and none of the reassurance from my partner was ever enough to calm the anxiety. Once I figured that out, I learned to calm my own anxiety and learned exactly what I need to hear from my partner to help myself and communicate clearly with my partner that need. 

In short, it’s not that you shouldn’t date someone who wants you and needs you and wants your love and attention. Those are wonderful things. But if the person you date hadn’t learned how to help themselves, they may put that on you, and you would have no way to help them because they have to do it. 

I now have a partner who knows that I’m needy and high anxiety, who loves me and meets my needs because I communicate it clearly instead of expecting mind-reading or controlling all aspects of his life. I can’t fix my anxiety. But I know how to work around it. My partner has been the best thing that’s ever happened to me. My anxiety has never been as low. I haven’t been suicidal for months. I still have to ask him constantly if he actually loves me, and he doesn’t feel bothered answering yes each time, no matter how many times a day. We do many things together and it’s wonderful companionship and I shower him with attention. 

It’s possible it could be the best thing ever happened to you, but only if the other person is mature enough to figure out how to cope. It’s more likely though, that it would go quite wrong. Also, consider yourself that you might not have the skills yet to handle your own anxieties and cause more issues once you’re in a relationship. It’s not a bad idea to learn more about yourself and learn skills that makes you a good partner."

Sometimes you just make bets on things no one can promise and hope things will turn your way eventually.

I’m in the midst of it actually. I don’t see suicide or death as inherently wrong. Its the emergency exit. It’s something that makes perfect sense when life is only suffering. It brings us to happy moments only to shove us to the deepest misery. It gets better. It also gets worse. People don’t tell you that second part when they try to convince you. They say you get used to handling the ups and downs. I don’t think so. Each time I have to learn something new to cope with each fall. Each time life gets better I feel suspicious of when it ends. I have wanted to die many times because it just doesn’t get better.

No one has the answer. For me, becoming a better person and learning new skills and teaching those skills to make other people’s lives a little easier motivates me to wait. I might be doomed, so might as well help someone. I don’t owe anyone that. Just maybe it helps. It’s helped me when I attempted last couple times to call someone. Maybe something will work for you to wait. Not that it makes you happy or make things better all on its own. More that it gets you to wait and maybe do something that you don’t abhor, or even feel like you can hate life a little less. The ups and downs will always happen. It will get better. Sure. It will also get worse again. But you can find something to anchor you in that. And you learn and adapt. I don’t know what the point is. But maybe I’m curious enough to find out."

My advisor and professors and loved ones are telling me to take a leave of absence to figure out how to fix this. The problem is that being a perfectionist was REQUIRED of me to excel and succeed from terrible and traumatic circumstances. I did excel and succeed. But it’s not a useful strategy anymore. It’s become dysfunctional. 

Right now my mindset is that I learned perfectionism when it was useful and it was immensely so. But it’s time to learn something new because times have changed. As humans, we optimize beyond survival and towards happiness by adapting. I will allow myself to adapt. I will allow myself the time and the focus and be gentle with myself.

Teachers,fbw75be,t1_fbtzleq,1577142473.0,I’m genuinely interested in the unit plans if you don’t mind sharing them
Teachers,fbcs7xh,t1_fbc0yqe,1576732171.0,"Thank you so much. I do have documentation and history of treatment. For my reasonable accommodations, I’m hoping for these:

- Teaching with music, meditation, mood regulation practices
- Teaching when I’m occasionally hiding under a desk but still talking and listening (mainly sensory overload)
- When I’m not expected to teach and I’m overwhelmed, let me leave the room, or give me a task with specific direction (clearly only applied as a student teacher)
- Teaching students group coping skills so they can apply them in stressful situations. 
- Be exempt from environments that are too bright or too loud

So far, because I’m the unknown, I’ve been through one placement that the mentor teacher was accommodating without needing to know more and I did amazing at that school with that teacher. But then my program switched me to the different school and that teacher was terrible to me and they sent me home without much explanation and wouldn’t take me back. On top of that, my university was treating me unfairly until things blew up in everyone’s face, involving the dean, the department chair, the professors, etc. Now my university is placing me back at the previous school, but they’re now super nervous rather than trusting me that I’d do fine because I did fine before. 

I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD, which leads to lots of ADHD symptoms. I didn’t used to always be like this. I have gone through some really traumatic events that led me here. So I’m also having difficulties settling with the reality that this is who I am now. I keep feeling like I’m in this space of needing to prove to everyone that I’m “normal” which makes me feel like a fraud because I was “normal” and now I’m not. My disabilities being invisible also get me this expectation from everyone that I am “normal”. So there’s pressure both from me and from others that I’m supposed to be “normal” and I’m so not. I’m working on these with a therapist. 

Are those accommodations reasonable? In the interview, what should I ask or say to ensure reasonable accommodations?"

I always value the alone together kind of feeling when I'm really depressed. Just to know that someone's around but not interacting with because I don't have the energy. Enjoy the gifts and food. It's good to keep those moments anyway even if it doesn't feel ""happy"""
FML,fae1qo3,t3_e8rm81,1575991786.0,Love your username. Wise choice
KindVoice,f9uy9bt,t3_e71g3p,1575659849.0,"When it’s drowning, I just want you to know that if you just keep looking for kindness and giving kindness, it turns itself around. When it first did for me, I panicked because I didn’t know if I would just lose it all. I’m still struggling a lot too. Some days it’s easier to say I can wait for it to get better. Some days I just want things to end. But for one reason or another I try to hold it together. Keep posting when you feel like you need someone. It’s a kind place here. People respond."
KindVoice,f9uxwin,t1_f9uvg2l,1575659666.0,I needed this and a few of my friends too. Thanks. I didn’t know this sub existed.
gifsthatkeepongiving,f9uw38h,t3_e6v2pg,1575658742.0,I listened to https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=wXOh1xiug9g&feature=share while watching this. Epic af
Teachers,f9siyay,t1_f9sicjq,1575593366.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. Even if you’re trying not to take things personally, hearing it everyday is abusive and it will get to you. It’s honestly a fair call to stand up for safe working conditions. I hope you have other teachers standing by your side on this. It helps to not be the only one. To be sure, having a backup plan for another job placement would be smart. And have other teachers from other schools as advocates help too."
Teachers,f9sgybb,t3_e6ogdr,1575592224.0,I’m a student teacher right now and I just think we should all just quit collectively and demand better conditions rather than accepting it is what it is because we don’t believe much would change. Like... we’re working with the next generation to make change!
teenagers,f9ix9cz,t3_dp93wd,1575348496.0,I can talk if you wanna pm me. I just leave it open here.
Needafriend,f9hdbxb,t1_f9h9i05,1575313238.0,"Same boat. I’m 25F, an immigrant to the US. With kids since 22. Not even my kids. My parents sent my minor siblings to me to care for. What I can say is I just keep it together “for the kids” and I’m dead inside. I hope the kids will make it happier than I am. That’s really it."
youngadults,f981kod,t3_e3zgma,1575172847.0,"It’s great sometimes and it’s shit sometimes. And I can’t really seem to get a hold of things. I don’t know. I like life right now but sometimes I really hate it. And regardless of my mood, I think life is pointless. Call it what you will, existential crisis or whatnot, I’ve been in it for years and it’s hard to call it a crisis when I just took a dive for the worse and stayed there. Don’t really know if I have any hope of getting much better than this. And the hopelessness just spiral if I don’t distract myself with something else. Distraction can’t be something “productive” either because it’s exactly what got me here in the first place. With the social circle I’m in, I feel like most other 25yo are still just starting a life and I feel like I’ve lived a life already. I’ve been through all the crap like abuse and homelessness and violence and rape and systemic discrimination because of my nationality, race, and gender (am non-binary). I still went through school and graduated and now doing my masters (somehow I don’t know). But I’m so exhausted and I don’t really want to keep going. I would have good days. Today was pretty nice. The nagging of the pain still bites me though. The people around me love me and want me around because I’m this  happy bubble and I bring them really different perspectives that I lived through and they didn’t. But it feels so lonely, so fake. I hear these quarter life crises but I’ve been in this for years. If that’s what I’m having, what else is there to do? Being high functioning and a perfectionist, I’ve “done” all the things people said to do, meditate, therapy, exercise, eat well, drink water and tea, no caffeine, no alcohol, sleep, take medication. It’s the “not doing” that I need, but I can’t. And if I don’t do the self care, I’m fucked. I try to expect imperfection, but whatever it is in my mind, I can’t stop it. I’m rambling so I’m sorry if that’s way more than asked for. Thanks if you read this far."
depression,f8w8xgb,t3_e2llp0,1574885671.0,"Same. I just texted some people. They’re about to come over and get me to get my shit together. I’m pretty high functioning so whenever I’m like this, people around me notice. It’s worse without people. It’s always worse without people."
webcomics,f8vthbn,t1_f8vhry2,1574876949.0,"From personal experience, depression itself is a problem. Even when my other stressors went away, my brain is so used to the shit that it can’t comprehend good things."
depression,f8t1shp,t3_e1ze0u,1574793940.0,"Same. Life is going really well. I have nothing to actually want to die about. Life was shit before. Life has never been better. I finally have a lot of people who love me, a stable home, not living paycheck to paycheck at the moment, and kids to invest life in, and going to school. I still have nightmares of people trying to kill me and my family. Today I've been wanting to die and crying on and off every half hour or so. I take meds everyday, go to therapy every week, workout, meditate, drink water and tea, eat healthy, make art, help people. It just sucks and I just hate myself. It's real. I haven't found the answers. I think it's just something I accept. I talk about it to people and I stick with those who understand. I spend less time with people that I have to pretend to be happy with. I let myself be miserable when the moment comes and I work around it until it lessens its grip. I try to be mindful about my old coping habits and try better coping habits. But that's all I got. It's just miserable for a while, and maybe that's it for life."
depression,f8t06tm,t3_e205s5,1574792942.0,"It's OK to be a broken parent. It's also OK that I have an OK time telling you this but I can't even say it to myself. I have learned that it's valuable for children to know that you aren't always OK. It gives the children permission to not be OK. If all you demonstrate to your children is that you're the superhero, like my parents did to me, one possibility is that they'll believe that they have to have high standards, that they aren't deserving unless they meet the impossible standards they set because that's what you set an example of. The more you demonstrate to your children that you love them, and you don't need to be perfect to love them, and that you can love yourself while you love them, they will learn that, too. They will learn to love themselves when they take care of others. They will learn that it's OK to not be perfect and still be deserving of love. They will learn that they're not entitled to others' perfection. They will learn to have compassion and flexibility when things don't go as planned. I have learned that while my parents expected perfection out of themselves and told me to have compassion towards myself, I have no idea how to love myself at all, but I am very good at expecting perfection. Children learn from watching and doing. There's nothing that you can tell them that will make them learn how to love themselves, even if you show them that you love them. They learn how to love themselves from watching you loving yourself."
depression,f8sz30k,t3_e1vuh0,1574792253.0,Yeah I feel you
matheducation,f6wvj71,t1_f6uk172,1573235832.0,Wow! I applaud you for your efforts and I love you already just for the love of math
ScienceTeachers,f6wo5kq,t3_dt5sm9,1573231054.0,"Students should put their knowledge to the practical application. Students may not commit to the science field, but they need to have enough science literacy to not buy into pseudo science and use fake science to validate their biased belief. With practicing and knowing the process of how science is applied in their daily lives as consumers in this capitalist society, they become much more aware of who they're supporting and in the grand scheme, how their actions and where their dollars go impact the larger community. If they're just learning science in the confines of the classroom, science literacy isn't necessary for them to retain. As soon as you make knowledge of science relevant, necessary, and ultimately, life saving, they will learn it, whether they're going into science as a career or not. The high number of policy makers and business people with no scientific literacy is exactly why they're willing to be greedy regardless of consequences - they don't believe in the consequences. But consequences don't care what they believe, and the privileged won't take the worst of it."
