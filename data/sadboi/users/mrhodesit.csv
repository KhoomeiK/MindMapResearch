You know how the php generates a page and 'spits' it out right? Now imagine, you have a php file on your server that only 'spits' out the information that you need from the database. It should return the data in JSON format.

You then use javascript on your generated page to make an xmlhttprequest request to get the newest information from the database from the file that just 'spits' out the data.

You also make the javascript do something with that data if the request went through, and you received that information you need from that database. In your case the ""Do something with the data"" would be putting the new information wherever you need it on the page."
