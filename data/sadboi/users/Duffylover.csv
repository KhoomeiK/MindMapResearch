I asked another buyer, he said it took 40 days for his item to come, partial tracking, he couldn't track it in postal system as well. Seller said item will only be traced upon delivery. Does partial tracking exist in poste italiane? In etsy it says pre-transit, in poste italiane it says:""Prodotto non Disponibile "". So its not entirely invalid. So is what the seller says legit?"

I say ok-I say if u can improve ur product i pay full price-no question asked.

Seller rant on instagram-say i discriminate her, say want to block me etc. Don't want to do my business. So i say ok i don't need ur item give me partial refund, close case.

So she says that i backed out on instagram and boohoo who wants to buy it."
singapore,fqww0oc,t3_gl3cml,1589719326.0,"Something really ridiculous happened on etsy...I asked for a custom rosie plush. Throughout the entire process-she kept asking if it is ok though its the dress-so its not very significant compared to the facial features which makes or breaks the thing. So I tried to empathise with the seller, being a chronic illness person myself, I even said my mental illnesses, all 4 of them. Then I said I wouldn't ask for refund if item turned out bad or leave one star review. So she was offended-say don't have to go ahead. OK-fine. I said never mind, go ahead, I believe in you, sorry and stuff. She comes out, and the plush is not very aesthetically pleasing(but she didn't show me) and she says she can't ship and offers full refund. Then she ends up saying she can ship but its not what she expected. Discount shipping discount price. Ok. Free shipping. I say ok. I say:""if the toy is more aesthetically pleasing esp around the eyes part, I can accept it, and I will pay full price with shipping"". Radio silence radio silence no response no response.

But what I saw on her Instagram pissed me off: She said I was discriminating against chronic illness sufferers and said that my ""one star review"" thing was hurtful. She said she didn't want to deal with me but had to. She didn't want to mail her toy to me.

So I got so pissed-I said ok I don't need ur item-give me a partial refund and I will close case. So she gives me a  partial refund.

Next, she said oh, boohoo, buyer backed out, who is going to buy my thing?

She has outed herself on Instagram complete with pictures of the toy. I don't want to post a picture of her toy but if you want pics, let me know. Tell me who's the asshole? Well or check the link i sent the other day on the daily thread. Underwhelming is an understatement. I asked my mum for opinions, and even she said it was ugly.

Edit;  [https://imgur.com/vv8yJRk](https://imgur.com/vv8yJRk)  it looks like this, ok? Plus she herself offer refund, then kbkp. Go rant on instagram then expect me to keep up my end of the bargain.

I could relate with the alter thing,for me it's a coping mechanism. But the more outward presentation is dissociative amnesia, fugue etc. Depersonalization. I'm sure I don't have DID. Sometimes I dissociate n get disorientated n feel everything is unreal. I realised parts of my childhood I forgot to tell the psych. Recently I remembered some memories like having a febrile fit as a child. Going for tuition and the helper took very long to fetch me home and I was very worried. But dissociation came on when I was 21. I was very depressed at 15-16, developed hallucinations at 17-18 then it went downhill from there.

Not sure. Those two success stories are from SIM-UB.

So from what I have gathered from the responses from a similar thread I asked, yes, u can take masters in NTU/SMU/NUS but coursework based ones are easier to get in. Research based not so much. Plus you need a high GPA bla bla bla. Gpa of 3.3 at least to even stand a chance. The rest I can't answer. For me, I feel there is no point taking masters because I am not working at a degree level job and sustaining it for more than a year or maybe many years due to my issues. It would just be for show. Like spending a bomb on overseas uni only to come back and not work. I am not from IT field. Arts and social science field but yea I think you should work first before taking masters.

I know people with mental health issues who can't work-they are on FAS, and they receive a fixed sum regardless of whether they work or not. I am not on Workfare income supplement because I don't qualify under SG enable's conditions like autism etc. I feel those on FAS, would have more money since cinemas and bars are shut-so less entertainment. Even the occasional cinema trip can put a dent in their limited resources. Those who are high flyer, can work from home and are relatively unscathed. Those mid range fresh graduate jobs are ok-employees probably want them to work from home-2.5k and above. Essential services-still needed. For me at least I earned $500 a month doing part-time, now my pay has dwindled to less than $100 a month. And my cell group people recommended me jobs like temperature screener, swabber, or work in factory with 3 rotating shifts-I say I can't do 3 rotating shift cause of medical issue. Swabber-i am that kind who easily forgets to bring mask out, need reminder, so I  cannot work as swabber. My parents say must be very careful. I really feel like Job from the Bible.

So it depends on how you look at it. I used to want to hit $2.5k and above....post poly and post degree, but now I am happy to even earn $1k. Been humbled by illnesses but that's a different story altogether. Like my ex cgl who works as a childcare teacher is probably grossly underpaid. So are some counsellors and one girl who had mental health issues working in equine assisted therapy. And other people whom I envy that they have full time jobs and are able to sustain-they probably earn $2k or at least $1.6k.

I saw an instagram post where the bakery seems very keen to hire people who are less experienced. But i sent my resume in and they haven't gotten back."
singapore,fqo36dm,t3_gjw6tx,1589506625.0,"Hey, I have ADHD-PI which means I do suffer from distractibility and forgetfulness. Recently, I have been searching for simple baking/baking commis jobs. May I know if employers tend to be tolerant to those who are slower to learn but have a lot of grit and determination when it comes to baking? I am willing to throw the trash and wash the dishes, things like that. I have few months of bakery working experience."

I don't like how the neighbour said that the girl has low IQ...its like so mean imho. Like imagine one day if I get featured in the press and my neighbours or ex schoolmates make such derogatory comments about me?

Speaking as a person who used to hear mean voices all the time, sometimes, I still do hear mean voices."

SGExams,fqhrt58,t3_gipw7s,1589383143.0,"Group work-shudder. In poly I sucked at accounting-didn't know what was going on. But in uni, i think i had a lot of conflict with group members. I remember in poly, we were doing a marketing module-i said how its more feasible to do a survey on mos burger as opposed to cars. Had to argue like siao. I interview random people in school for a biz comm project then end up not used. In uni, literally some of my groupmates insisted on doing a poster which looked like a mugshot instead-got criticised by teacher. ugh. People leaving things to the last minute, trying to tank group projects-it sucks. Some mental trauma here, but i think i have to be thankful for the times where i sucked and people had to save my ass....and not be too mindful of the times where i have to save others' asses."
