PS4,fr4mraj,t1_fr4lpuf,1589892371.0,"Back in 2018, Naughty Dog announced that the first game had sold over [17 million copies](https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1007320235731488770). It's probably fair to assume that it's around 20 million now. 

The highly-anticipated sequel to a game that sold 20 million copies isn't going to sell poorly just because a vocal online minority complains about gay characters and muscular women. Battlefront 2 suffered from the ridiculous monetization that even affected reviews for it (edit: I looked it up and BF2 didn't even sell poorly lol. It sold 9 million copies in <2 months and came just shy of EA's expectations) 

If Part II reviews well (which it presumably will, 90+ on metacritic feels like a safe bet), angry Gamers complaining about it online won't have a real impact.

I'd go as far as to say that most people aren't even aware the game has leaked, let alone seen the leaks. Youtube commenters are outnumbered by the people who just see The Last of Us ads on TV and go ""dope, when's this coming out?"". Look at something like Call of Duty or Fifa.

Gameplay should also be a clear improvement on the first game. Not drastically different but just better across the board. Naughty Dog is also Sony's flagship first party studio with almost limitless time and resources, so I'm expecting Part II to be the most visually impressive game of the year. 

Maybe I'm setting my expectations too high, but after Naughty Dog's consistent success over the years, ""just a good story"" isn't good enough for me. They created 3 GOTY's between 2009-2016.

Look at something like Far Cry.

Then in Far Cry New Dawn, the villains are two black girls, and that's also somehow bad because the game is promoting forced SJW diversity or some shit.

I feel like their opinions on this issue are tied directly to the protagonist. If they're playing as a straight white guy, then it doesn't matter who the baddie is. Like Joel and Marlene/David in the first Last of Us. 

But with Ellie and Part II, it's a lose-lose situation when dealing with Gamers. If you make the villain a white guy or a Christianity-esque cult, they'll get upset that this angry little lesbian is just killing poor straight dudes. If you make the villain a woman or a person of color, they'll complain that the game has no straight white men and that the developers have an agenda against them.

They just keep making games bigger and more ambitious, while being in crunch mode for literally *years*.

That Anthony Newman point is irrelevant. He's one of those passionate workaholics who doesn't mind crunch. Clearly his hard work earned him a spot as a co-director on Part II.

Of course with an ambitious piece of art like The Last of Us Part II, there will be some crunch at the end.

In response, Druckmann and the other leads started scrapping and revising. “That’s where changes were happening,” said one developer. “We need to add some stuff here so that it tells more of this story or gives you more narrative beats.”

In order to have those emotional low points really land and affect the player, you have to lift them up with happier moments as well. Otherwise the doom and gloom just gets overwhelming and the player becomes detached because everything is so sad that it wraps back around to being silly.

I just saw *Good Time* yesterday and that film is an example of that. It's a crime thriller where everything just keeps spiraling out of control and getting worse. At a certain point, the horrible events just end up being funny because you start thinking ""Alright, what's gonna go wrong next?""."
