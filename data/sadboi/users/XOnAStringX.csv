OCD,fpkb8hb,t3_gdsfo2,1588691499.0,"To be completely honest, since joining reddit 2 years ago I have felt so much better just knowing that other people out there feel like this as well. (This account is newer). I am so very sorry that you all feel like this, I just don’t feel so alone and afraid. I have been afraid my whole life and I’m 32. It is an extremely debilitating disorder that other people in my life really don’t understand at all."
bipolar,fp17sde,t1_foyxkoa,1588226852.0,"Awe this made even me feel so good and wholesome ♥️♥️♥️ 
Thank you for being so kind"
bipolar,fp13rqw,t3_gai4jy,1588223602.0,I am crying and laughing.
ADHD,foelvvh,t3_g6ykg6,1587707319.0,This shit is ROUGH sometimes but the people of Reddit always have your back! You belong somewhere and are genuinely understood.
bipolar,foeiuu8,t1_fodgtyu,1587704919.0,"Thank you! I actually will check that out. This is the best community and I really feel so understood. It’s a wholesome feeling. ♥️ My dad is starting to pick up on things that I have a hard time “working on.” He asked if I wanted him to point out things that I do and I said HELL YES! Lol. Please tell me in a nice way why I piss everyone off and have a hard time living ♥️ I find so many resources on here. I tell everyone about Reddit, it’s changed my life."
bipolar,fo8l7ag,t3_g6bn1p,1587598729.0,Thank youuuu. I’m in the middle of trying to explain my mental illnesses to my family and it’s actually going ok.... but to get it all to stick and for them to really understand... that’s been rough. They are trying though and this will help! :)
bipolar,fo6x2q3,t1_fo4zn8o,1587568335.0,Ride the waves. I say this too lol
bipolar,fo6wvrq,t3_g5qpwx,1587568234.0,"Oh yeah. Went through that a couple of weeks ago. I was doing some crazy shit that was wrong and sexually deviant, but I enjoyed every second of it. It made me happy and I laughed about it. It felt good and I was completely in tune with a dark side of me that I really liked. That’s fucked up, but the fact is that I’ve been like this for so long that I’m able to just go, “Oops I fckd up again,” and just keep moving on with my life."
bipolar,fnqtgo4,t3_g3cpuk,1587171854.0,Super into galaxy aesthetics right now 😍 Love this!
bipolar,fnp4qp5,t3_g2zanj,1587139186.0,"Yep they were like... do you think you might have adhd as well? Uh yah duh but that’s the one I know the most about and I ride that bitch all day 🤣 
Now help me control my moods and keep my ocd at bay mf. Plz and thank you. 
I just tell ppl I’m riddled."
OCD,fnn16cl,t3_g2i3pu,1587082227.0,"I hope this helps. I confronted one thing at a time. There are many. When I thought something messed up I would think more about it like “ok I’m thinking this thing.” Would I do this thing? No. Is someone going to get hurt because I think they will. No. Would my anxiety make me do this thing? Omg Maybe. *Enter breathing technique* 7 minutes in, seven minutes hold, seven minutes out. Shake it off. “Woah weird.” Laugh about it. Start positively affirming yourself instead of negative cognitive thoughts. Instead of “OMG WHY AM I THINKING THIS I AM THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HURT BC OF ME I AM TRASH.” Think about it, it’s fuckin disturbing. But that’s just shit your brain thinks sometimes and you learn to not be so hard on yourself. So what, you think weird shit, so do other people. No what ifs. I don’t have a shit brain. I have anxiety. You start to think, “I am a good person and I would never ever hurt anyone and no one is going to get hurt bc of me. I am not going to die bc I can’t do this thing I want to do so bad to make me feel better I’m just not going to do it. *Enter the ‘it gets worse before it gets better.”* Thinking the thing, is HARD. It’s scary. Not doing the thing is harder. It’s scarier. Just do it. Push through it. Right now I’m afraid I’m going to be triggered but then I step back and I think, maybe I’m helping someone... and I’m strong enough now to do it. Reddit helps like so much even if it triggers you at first. I wrote down things I liked about myself. I wrote down things that I liked. I think a thing and think, “weird...” and stop worrying about it and move along thinking about things I’ve learned that I like now. I sought out stressors and I have left behind people and things that were pressures on my mental health. It’s hard! But the honest truth is that it was worth it. I’ve pushed through it and now I look at it as a period in my life that was intense and horrifying but it’s who I was not who I am. And then I got into therapy. When they asked why I needed to see someone I told them, I’m ok right now, but I want to stay that way and we are working mostly on how hard I am on myself and how strong I am to confront my fears 💚 Do not ruminate, just let it flow and let it go. We are warriors battling things that people can’t even imagine or comprehend and I have a peace about it and with it now. You’re not alone at all."
bipolar,fnmo4ge,t3_g2o9gm,1587074967.0,"Um tbh I’m on both and I’ve had a little bit of a hightened manic episode BUT I knew I was doing it and it helped a lot to think, “Ok we’re gonna be fuckin weird for a minute here but maybe we can ride it out.” It will get easier just let it all come in waves like it does and be more self aware. Breathe. Don’t google things."
OCD,fnmneit,t3_g2jiji,1587074584.0,"This is the post: 
I’ve learned that the more you think about it the worse it gets. Which sounds like a different language because... what? But I’ve been in “remission” for a few months now and I get terrified thinking I’ll go back to that way of thinking, BUT if I just take the thoughts and breathe and let them go and face them, it gets easier. It took me about 2 years to achieve this moment of peace in my life and mind. Knowing there are other people out there like this helps, therapy helps, someone to tell you that you’re not crazy, you’re just so wound up that you’re in knots. You can untie yourself a little at a time and tbh, not to trigger you but, it got worse before it got better... it can get better and it did for me. I know it can happen again but damn am I enjoying this peace. Breathe and understand that a lot of people think “bad” or “weird” thoughts and they are still functioning and living and you can too. Your thoughts do not define who you are. Your anxiety gives you bad thoughts. 
You are not your anxiety, you have anxiety and you can relax and enjoy life. Face it that you’ve thought weird shit and try to laugh about it, even if it’s real fucked. Like “woah ok that was a messed up one but moving on.” It takes time and practice but I swear my ocd has taken a back seat and it can stay there. Believe in yourself 🙂"
OCD,fnmmx39,t1_fnm6kie,1587074331.0,"I have learned that a lot of the ocd is anxiety and anxiety is considered the great “what if”. Oh shit why did I think that... what if... endless possibilities. I also have pure ocd and I’m in remission rn. I made a lengthy comment on an earlier ocd post. It may help. It’s helped me a lot. As for now I am battling the bipolar and adhd with meds and realization, self awareness. I’m drained rn but overall I feel like I’m getting the hang of it."

We can break cycles and live fearlessly 💪🏻"

OCD,feycm0g,t3_eqsfyw,1579443795.0,This felt like a hug
dpdr,few7wi4,t3_eqmoa1,1579406636.0,"I like to go outside and touch the ground and then I think, “Ok, and now I’m well grounded.” It doesn’t always help a whole lot but it makes me laugh."
BPD,fevh6hy,t3_eqbj0k,1579397385.0,"I’ve learned that this is a BPD thing and have learned to step back, feel the emotion, and then respond. I feel like realizing the things you are doing, that are a part of it, when you are doing them, helps a lot. Unfortunately people will not change their tones but you can change how you react to them."
OCD,fefj06g,t3_eouzwo,1579057331.0,I do not feel like your therapist should ever call you “weird” and I am pretty sure it is her job to teach you ways to stop ruminating instead of just telling you to stop doing it..... you are not “weird” and you are not alone.
