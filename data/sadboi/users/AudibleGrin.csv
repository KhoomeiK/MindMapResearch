This was a neighborhood where gangsters were openly doing their gangster thing, and gunshots were a common occurrence. My best friend in that neighborhood was a drug dealer whose criminal record made it difficult for him to find a legit job that paid a living wage. So he dealt drugs primarily because it offered him the best economic outcome (his words, not mine). The people in that neighborhood aggressively resisted gentrification and lost, because money wins out. I find it extremely unlikely that my friend (and all of his friends) were forced out of that neighborhood and then magically found their economic situations improved. They just moved their various criminal enterprises to somewhere more affordable, more concentrated, and probably more violent.
