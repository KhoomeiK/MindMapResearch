Who even cares if it is it literally doesn’t make a difference at all. People can realize all along that they were attracted to men after so much time because of the stigma society used and still has against them or they just realized after a lot of time. Which would be they are born with it, and if people who are claim they don’t think it’s a choice and it’s just what happens at birth, better taking their word for it no?
