custommagic,fm3bheu,t3_fsc8j4,1585718141.0,I think like a lot of people have said it’s would be better if there was a way for her to transform back built into her. BUT I love the card even without it. I would totally make a commander deck with her!
lfg,fh24x7x,t1_fh20lfs,1581235372.0,I unfortunately do not have other players and I can do Wednesday’s!
lfg,fgr7jcs,t1_fgokkm2,1581040070.0,I’m in Huntington Beach but I’m willing to travel within Orange County! Weekends would be best any time but any day during the week but Tuesday and Thursday I can do after 7:30pm
DnD,fgny9q8,t1_fgnvof0,1580955544.0,THANK YOU
pokemon,fghrdkw,t3_eydihd,1580791721.0,I love how chunky rusticate looks
reddeadredemption,fg7u30l,t3_exaspk,1580601480.0,Poseidon was sick of you abusing your horses.
magicTCG,fdxx3pt,t1_fduff4s,1578773844.0,"Ok thank you! So definitely lightning bolt, terminate, and one or two more burn/kills? Tragic slip maybe?"
magicTCG,fdu96pd,t1_fdu23w8,1578729757.0,I definitely decided to cut out the discard stuff.  Should I ditch blightning?
magicTCG,fdfnc5l,t3_el030u,1578365675.0,You can counter an effect from a spell that resolved the previous turn? Or did it not resolve fully until the end step of the extra turn?
magicTCG,fbtgypq,t1_fbtgu64,1577078520.0,Awesome thank you!
custommagic,fb3omqs,t3_eb5h9x,1576481240.0,Wait so can you only cycle this from within the graveyard since that would count as playing it or does it not work that way.
OpenEmu,f9n8cqi,t1_f9n45w7,1575479185.0,I’m not sure about with open but I have seen it work on a different emulator. The person was able to have dvds and other cds read because of the hardware being used.
DnD,f7gsdg7,t3_dvzsef,1573715286.0,Wow these look incredible!
DMAcademy,f70qb3n,t3_dtx53e,1573331383.0,"I think it’s good to plan a plot, but to remain flexible and keep it very open. In my campaign I’m running I have an overarching plot of what’s happening but For the most part I have just characters and places created and I’m allowing for my players to direct how the story unfolds. Some things are set in stone as in what happens, but how it gets to that point or when it happens remains up to the players."
fairytail,f6ancd0,t3_dq9w6k,1572759448.0,And then NaLu can be a thing!
mentalhealth,f6ahhnw,t3_dqkfx0,1572756957.0,That’s incredible! I’m so proud of you! Keep up the good work!
custommagic,f5b7lad,t3_dnei05,1572118223.0,Well balanced and great art!
pokemonchallenges,f597lf4,t1_f58keiu,1572074891.0,I’m not too familiar with all the bug types available in the kanto games so I was just wondering if you’d planned out what the team would look like.
pokemonchallenges,f587eqs,t3_dn012o,1572050138.0,Any ideas on the team?
MonsterHunterWorld,f586nnr,t1_f54mjtx,1572049729.0,I’m excited I just need to get through this semester
MonsterHunterWorld,f54gqpt,t1_f54g0r6,1571981721.0,This is great for later thank you! World is my first game but I’m looking forward to tigrex
FiftyFifty,f53vnrx,t3_dmhat5,1571965050.0,For some reason I thought they’d be loose and stringy
pokemonchallenges,f3oobin,t3_dg7go1,1571023409.0,Johnstone on YouTube did this with red I believe that could give you some ideas.
reddeadredemption2,f3ak7jr,t1_f3ajw1z,1570776973.0,I know I know but I’m just now getting through chapter 6. Just saw how old wounds don’t heal for her but maybe Arthur couldave helped :(
heroesofthestorm,f0tyd7s,t3_d6ib8b,1568931081.0,I seriously thought that death wing was coming to heroes and now I’m sad. This was incredibly well done though!
wow,ezrr13f,t1_ezrqvql,1568077598.0,Awesome thank you! I’ve always loved holy ever since wrath.
podcasting,eyiqe56,t3_cwos4a,1567106080.0,My buddy and I are running one on our own experiences with our mental health. He’s on the spectrum and deals with anxiety and depression and I’ve got bipolar disorder and general anxiety disorder. I’ve got to start making my own posts I have so many questions.
custommagic,eyiq71v,t1_eyfk0m9,1567106000.0,I figured I just wanted to be sure!
custommagic,eyfhkva,t3_cwui6s,1567048917.0,Paying its mana cost or no?
podcasting,eyf2faf,t3_cwos4a,1567042435.0,Is it industry standard to edit out our ins? Asking for a friend
FiftyFifty,exjr6w2,t3_ct6pnd,1566357949.0,"Is that a pool of blood, or a delicious snack? The world may never know."
wow,ew34dup,t3_cmahvi,1565063826.0,Hi what is class balance and all classes being equally good at their roles.
Blizzard,ew3454l,t1_ew1q63q,1565063615.0,Oh I’ve never heard of that one.
Blizzard,evu9xeo,t1_evu338t,1564789448.0,Advent children? I loved that movie!
Blizzard,evrm5av,t1_evigtyg,1564712008.0,I got a tour of blizzard and they let us watch one trailer in their movie room thing and the legacy of the void trailer is easily the best.
Blizzard,evrm3l0,t1_evq1y8k,1564711971.0,I’ve been a fan for years but I really liked it too. I think they did a good job of balancing khadgar and medivh. They were powerful but not too powerful.
Blizzard,evrly4c,t1_evjvmdt,1564711856.0,That’s fair I can second this
Blizzard,evrlxft,t1_evj3j1o,1564711841.0,But I want one ._.
Blizzard,evrludr,t1_eviz6c0,1564711776.0,YES THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC
Blizzard,evrlt30,t1_evitt7h,1564711749.0,Even if they brought in animators or partnered with another studio as long as the style was still in the blizzard style I wouldn’t care. They have so much lore to work with. I mean as long as they partner with a studio that would allow them to make an r rated movie for say Starcraft because that shit is not pg13. I mean maybe but.
