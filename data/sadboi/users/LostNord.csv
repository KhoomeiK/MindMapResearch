AskReddit,fq2qneq,t1_fq2ovqf,1589058702.0,"Honestly, the most important thing you need to do is write a very specific acceptance criteria, get the client to sign off on it and always refer back to it. In the AC label all the things you'll be covering with the design/site/software, write these points using user stories, which are basically ""as a user I can do X thing"" then you explain in technical terms how you'll be doing that thing. For example ""as a user I can register and gain access to the portal"" this point is followed by ""after registering with my email address and creating a password I will receive an email that allows me to varify my account and then log in to the portal"".

When it then comes time to checkpoint meetings or handover you can go through the project from start to finish using each point. This way if they point anything out that's not been signed off you can easily have the ""if you want this addition it'll be X amount of extra development"". I'd only use this method if despite being well aware of things being signed off, they'll ask for more, this way you're giving them some extra control in a managed way.

Sorry for the long post, but this is something I wish I'd learned a long time ago, it would have made my freelance days much easier."

AskReddit,fq1zf2k,t1_fq1xffb,1589051438.0,"I 100% get what you're saying, my team prides themselves on their work and I have the utmost confidence in their abilities and know they are always prepared to go above and beyond. And a lot of the time I don't have to do this, the client gets a clearly defined statement of works and I will update them at every milestone and provide weekly meetings. Most of the time the client understands from day one what they're getting, they understand the limits of their budget or the time frame they've given. 

However, you will always come across a client who doesn't give a single damn about any of the planning or criteria that's been put forwards, these are the ones that want something for nothing. I've found it's better to handle them subtly this way, than potentially damage any reputation or continued sale possibilities. I've seen bad clients who are relied on by a previous company as they spend a lot and keep most of their developers paid, not being subtle can lead to unfortunate entanglement where the client then begins to expect extra works at no cost, or a continued development cycle, once it starts it's hard to stop."
