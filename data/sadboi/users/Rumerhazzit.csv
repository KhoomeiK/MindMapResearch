harrypotter,fpq383v,t1_fppv4v3,1588814271.0,"I can totally understand why other people might think of them as less sympathetic characters, but my view of them is generally as a bunch of harmless prats. The only time we know of where one of their pranks got out of control and became dangerous, it was Sirius acting alone and not thinking through what he was saying.

We get a view of Sirius' character as someone who is very emotionally driven, who reacts hugely to confrontation or being challenged (especially when it comes to Snape), and who is impulsive to a fault. I don't for a second think he was planning to send Severus to his death, and as soon as James finds out what he's done he rushes off to ensure Snape doesn't get hurt.

We also don't see a single instance of them attacking anyone for no reason. When it comes to Snape, we're talking about a racist, bigoted Death Eater who openly supports Voldemort, surrounds himself with other dark wizards who hold the same beliefs, uses slurs, and, we're told, ""never missed an opportunity to hex James"". We see an unprovoked attack in Snape's Worst Memory, but I definitely wouldn't say it's for ""no reason"", and we never see James act this way with anyone but Snape, who gives as good as he gets.

James was arrogant, a tad misogynistic, and held a grudge; Sirius was overconfident, easily bored and acted as though his boredom was a crime, and craved disruption for the sake of chaos; Remus was too spineless to stand up to his friends and stop them breaking school rules; and Peter was a simpering fanatic who followed James around like a ""stan"".

They're flawed characters, but that makes them incredibly believable. They make stupid mistakes, but that makes their stories that much more compelling. They do shitty things, but that doesn't make them bad people. There are a myriad of examples of their true characters, at least Remus, Sirius, and James', throughout the text, and they're all good people. But they all have major, believable flaws, and that's exactly why I find them so enjoyable to read about."

* Do something creative. Draw a picture or build a model.
* Do some chores, such as cleaning the house, doing laundry, or washing dishes. Do these tasks mindfully, focusing all attention on the task at hand. Don't clean up on autopilot while you ruminate in your mind.
* Read a good book or watch a funny movie.
* Call or write a letter to a good friend or family member.

BPD,fnqc7ev,t3_g37inw,1587161781.0,"I used to have ***such a huge issue*** with this, with one person in particular. My FP, currently my best friend, at the time he was my SO as well. He is very flaky, and at the time he was undiagnosed as borderline, so he was dealing with his own shit too. He'd tell me he was coming, even tell me he was on the bus, and then never turn up. It ended up being the reason I ended our relationship (*well, that time anyway, haha*). 

I ended up literally curled in a ball on the bathroom floor crying, more than once I called him to yell at him and say pretty harsh things, because he'd do it *all the time*, and he knew how badly it affected me.

What helped me overcome it was lowering my expectations. Honestly, every single time we get upset or angry or overwhelmed, it's because of expectations, e.g. expecting someone to do, or not to do something, expecting someone to say, or not to say something, expecting situations to go a certain way.

When we go into a situation with firm expectations on how it's going to go, we're leaving a **lot** of potential to be upset, let down, ""wronged"" in some way. Having no expectations has helped me so much! For instance, the mindset of ""This party could be terrible, and I might want to go home, but at least I'll have gotten out of the house and made myself do a thing!"" helps, and I usually end up enjoying myself a lot more because I wasn't going in to it dictating how things had to go.

When it came to seeing this particular person, if we made plans I'd go into it thinking ""There is a very good chance that he won't show up and this won't happen"", which meant that when it inevitably didn't happen, I wasn't let down, it was as much as I was preparing myself for! And then, if it *did* happen, I was overjoyed, because I wasn't expecting it.

Of course, managing your expectations is easier said than done, and it takes a lot of time and practice to become self regulated when things don't go to plan. Distraction techniques and the ""STOP"" skill both really helped me cope with it when I was in the thick of it, too. This reply is already dreadfully long, sorry, I just really understand how this feels, but if you want some distraction technique examples, or an explanation of ""STOP"", I'll be happy to explain!"

There was a lot of, ""SAME!"" and ""OMG, ME!"", and I think that's wonderful!

It's important to recognise that things like people saying ""Yes, I can totally relate to that!"" when you're describing how you feel is them trying to empathise with you, trying to find common ground and understand where you're coming from, which is a positive thing!

My best friend got me watching it. He absolutely *loathes* Carole, but he *adores* Joe. He argues that Carole is worse than Joe ""because she's a hypocrite"", but the entire time I was watching I couldn't believe how ridiculously hypocritical Joe is the entire time! In fairness, I think he was very much swayed by the reddit hate train for Carole, and the general tendency here to put men above women in a lot of aspects, but I can't understand how people can give Joe a pass and condemn her as a demon.  
As you say, her enclosures are so much better than Doc's or Joe's, she doesn't breed the animals, she doesn't have cub petting sessions, and her message is a positive and important one! I don't for a second think she's a good person, I think she's done fucking horrible things, and I think tigers being kept in cages is a sacrilege, no matter who's doing it.

But Joe and Doc are promoting the idea of keeping animals in cages, breeding them, taking newborn cubs to pass them around a circle of loud people, being hassled and handled, jostled about by little kids, killing them when they stop being profitable, and generally upholding the ideas of using animals for money, keeping them captive, using them to ""look cool and get tons of chicks"" (or prey on young straight boys), it's sick. For God's sake, Joe is constantly talking about how the idea of animal rights is ""bullshit"" and how he wants to shoot anyone who cares more about the animals than him lining his pockets.

At least Carole is out here trying to spread the message that keeping tigers as pets is wrong, that cub petting is wrong, that taking animals out to talk shows or parading them around in cages is wrong, and advocating for their protection. That's *something*!"

Like, if you were missing a finger, or only had one lung, I can't imagine for a second you'd be getting even half the judgments you are.

ESH because you should have told him, not because breasts are the be all and end all of a relationship, but because trust and communication are. It's something you see as a big deal, something you're self conscious about, and you should have shared it with him.

He sucks because of the way he reacted, like you were disgusting and he couldn't touch you, telling you that you had ""cheated him"", and breaking up with you because ""he didn't know you were missing a breast and you *looked fine in your pictures*"". That's the bit that does it for me. Not that he felt he'd been lied to, or that trust was broken, but that he thought you had a breast and *looked fine*, implying that you don't look fine because of your reminder of a deadly disease, and he doesn't want to be with you because one of your boobs is missing.

Whatever the case, pets should be fixed, and cutting bits of your pet off because you think it looks ""tough"" is disgusting.
