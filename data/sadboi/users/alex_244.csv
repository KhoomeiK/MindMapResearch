This is too accurate for me and super frustrating. Even worse is from being all super confident that they love you back to just screaming at yourself, convincing yourself they hate you and that they want out.

The whole loving a person one day and hating them the next is scary as shit. When it happens to me I just wanna die cause I feel so bad, as you said, for the people around me. They don't deserve it."
