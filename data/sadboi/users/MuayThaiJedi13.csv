depression,ff7cxk1,t3_erqjbv,1579646653.0,Makes sense. I was once hospitalized for a couple days. It takes you away from everyday life and lets you think on what’s most important. Like a reset button and rejuvenation period.
depression,fe6jal8,t3_enrs4c,1578892715.0,"Talking about it helps. Call it whatever you want. If it helps, do it. Better to seem like a Whitney b!tc# to some than a worthless pos to yourself. As long as you’re talking to someone who genuinely cares, you’re not bothering anyone."
depression,fe4inao,t3_engd6e,1578859726.0,I loved it. So relatable
shadowpeople,fdul48r,t1_fdukx25,1578734633.0,It’s an idea? They know we can see them. They are shadow to us. I’m trying to open the dialogue of what we may appear to them as.
Paranormal,fd9lyl9,t3_ek58zn,1578235176.0,Yeah
depression,fd6ltw7,t1_fd6lmtr,1578192883.0,"I hope so, bud"
depression,fd6jyqz,t1_fd6j72w,1578192188.0,Thanks man. All I can do is try and keep my head up and just keep doin whatever lol.. right? It’s been this way for so long. I feel like the character building events have been plenty enough. I’m now 35 and single. I’m not a virgin. I’ve had girlfriends. But always cheated. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I don’t know anymore
depression,fd6j1rz,t3_ek3uky,1578191793.0,You don’t deserve That shit. Let em have at it. You overcome and make yourself happy. Focus on you
depression,fd6ewsr,t3_ejamne,1578189937.0,Yep. I just can’t. Haven’t in nearly a decade
shadowpeople,fd6ercc,t1_fcuhnhc,1578189868.0,Same for me. Blacker than black. Did you touch it?
depression,fc51rql,t3_efwqy4,1577438665.0,"I agree. Nothing is sacred. Maybe once upon a time. But not now. It’s a wonder we maintain decency anymore. In the 2nd amendment we trust.  Whatever happens, we have that"
shadowpeople,fbzc53y,t1_fan0vdt,1577241800.0,I had never knew the phenomenon until it happened to me. Some people see them. Some are different encounters. I don’t equate mine to others completely though... I have yet to hear an experience much like mine. I wish there was some sort of expert somewhere that actually had facts and maybe answers. Because that’s just what I need for something like this.
shadowpeople,fbz9g0w,t3_e9j15x,1577239272.0,"I’m so depressed and lonely right now, I wish that thing would visit me rn. I’d hang out with it."
Paranormal,fbfgcwy,t3_ecxkrs,1576809917.0,Sounds different... you really aight to not mess with terot or ouija though. Unless you’re looking for stuff like this.
Paranormal,fb7bb7q,t1_fb7b6sx,1576583747.0,"Bye then, troll."
Paranormal,fb793yx,t1_fb6mvf2,1576580693.0,You’re the type that would end up under the covers with your eyes closed in a puddle of your own piss repeating “there’s no such thing as ghosts” if you saw what some have seen.
Paranormal,fb6ks4p,t1_fb6kioe,1576552731.0,I have no reason to lie. I posted this to find others who may have experienced the same. I do not suffer from any sleep disorder. I am of sound mind and know when I’m sleeping or not. I know what I see and feel. What’s your issue?
memes,fb3i361,t3_eb6yeb,1576473848.0,"I hate that. Like, have some sense. Sometimes they block a path with something that would be so easy to overcome it’s ridiculous. Put something substantial there instead..."

shadowpeople,fajbid7,t3_e97ndo,1576130713.0,There are trolls in every corner of the internet. Don’t let them turn you away from a community
shadowpeople,fajavax,t3_e90tqt,1576130059.0,So what was the conversation?
