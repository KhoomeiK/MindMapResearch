There are some pretty close replicas when it comes to the usual like burger patties, sausages or minced meat, both taste and looks

2. One person doesn't do much to such an industry of course, but that's the same with any unethical industry. Or any ethical issue like racism let's say. If you stop being racist or buying from Chinese sweat shops, it won't solve racism worldwide and it won't make a dent in the sweatshop industry. It will however be a big burden off your shoulders to know you are not contributing to it. And luckily, you are not the only one doing this, millions of us are with you, and THAT makes a dent and lowers the amount of animals being brought into existence to be killed. They only produce what people buy

3. In restaurants it's often hard yes, but it depends on the restaurant of course, there are also full vegan restaurants. Fast foods and Pizza chains now all have vegan options. In the shops its as easy as finding meat. Don't just replace meat with meat replicas, they are expensive and considered junk food, just have them once a week or something

4. Im not sure what you're asking here to be honest. Yes we evolved eating meat - along with plants. (questionable if meat is the REASON we evolved ""higher"" or not, you can research that yourself). We are omnivores and can live off plants or meat or both AFAIK. In the past veganism might have been risky because there wasn't much research or supplements available, but today its pretty easy."

It's good because animals which feel pain and suffering aren't being forced to exist just to be killed for sick and selfish human desires. Every time I saw a pig or a cow in my life I valued them and would never dream of killing them myself, so why am I paying others to do it?

However, I have to continue living in this shit grind that we are forced to live in. And so, I am miserable and want to die.

Maybe I wouldn't be in Hawaii just chilling under the starlit sky, but I'm not there and can't be

It just made me more sure that life is bullshit and death is preferable, and can't wait to be ""there"" asap"

depression,fpje52y,t3_gdsjip,1588665204.0,"I still can't answer the question from school when I was 12 and they asked us what we want to be in life.

I'm 27, still zero goals or motivation except death, same as when I was 10, 15, 20.

I just want to take drugs and rot, drugs are the only thing that ever made me feel better

I can't ever have goals or motivations, because I know nothing ever made me happy and I guess I had some achievements in my life, they don't fucking last 5 minutes. Its useless.


I look at my friends with their bought houses at 25 and daily routines and skills and I just want to abandon them because they keep rubbing it in my face even though they think they aren't"

That's all that could ever change my mood even if it's just for the duration of it

Dear death why won't you come for me"

I actually was avoiding it for like a year because of the above reasons, and now it's become my favorite single player game since PS2

Story is good, it didn't blow my mind too much, but it's just very impactful, together with the music, the atmosphere, I can't get the game (or maybe it's just the ass?) out of my head since I finished it.

It's about the path of finding meaning in existence, if I had to describe it simply. If you are not into that kind of thing at all, the story might not interest you"

Hopefully it will be out tmrw as a recording.

I do have to say however that it seems very much like Brian Rose is hyping it up and getting so much money from people, and spamming you with ads and newsletters and workshops crap, and trying to make himself a big name in the ""revolution"" by calling it the biggest stream in human history (lol, there are probably kids streaming minecraft for more people) , but isn't able to get one livestream going, just a bit disheartening for all of the donators I imagine. Love the message, but this Brian guy is forcing this to be his personal PR a bit too much"
