relationship_advice,fqf8clb,t3_gijach,1589320417.0,"The only way out is the hard way, you are going to have to spill the beans to your wife and watch her break down. 

The fact that you could so easily ""have meaningless sex"" with the first woman to hop on this trainwreck just shows how little respect and empathy you have for your wife.

You don't seem like a man who cares, you are a living nightmare and this is no mistake nor accident because you willing/purposely seeked other vacant vaginas.

I don't see any way to fix this and I hope you tell her the truth."

Anxiety,fq5h264,t3_ggwo3l,1589105128.0,"I have conflict anxiety, I tend to cry over people shouting at me, I just stay away from aggressive people which is why I love my bf so much because he doesn't shout or get into heated discussions that could upset me. 

To avoid conflict I always stay quiet and shuffle away if friends/family were debating something. Sometimes it's unavoidable so it's best to just respond with something like ""that's an interesting observation"" or ""I see your point"" or an enthusiastic ""I think you might be on to something"". You can even just ask them to elaborate their point and just listen. 

If something like this makes you anxious it's okay to just walk away and go calm down. People should respect that you need to get out of the situation and stop bringing up the subject unless it's important then they should wait until you're finally ready to talk."

Crying over someone who has just proved that they don't care. 

I never really show enough emotions In  a relationship and I get the feeling of doing nothing because what is the point anymore. Instead of being understanding and empathetic people just get angry at me, nothing different, same crap different face.

After all this I'm still waiting for some Robin Hood or Prince figure to just pull me out of what's making me feel like I should not be existing. 

I'm tired and I can't sleep because it feels like someone just punched my heart repeatedly."

I sound like a mouse.

I can't stand up for myself or get involved in verbal conflict.

I struggle to make conversations. (my bf points this one out)

I tend to give short replies. (and this one) 

I am very quiet. (This gets said a lot)
