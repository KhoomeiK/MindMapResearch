But when we're stripped of all this, it becomes easier because no one expects to be anything, not even us, because we are in a new environment so we can just rewrite ourselves.

* I have very strong panic attacks (my chest hurts for days), What helps me is mindfulness. (The app headspace is great), it helps to learn how to control your breathing.   
Something that helps me a lot when I have a panic attack is ""square breathing"": breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold for 4etc...   
what that does is force me to think of my breathing and try to regulate it. So during a panic attack, it helps take control of ""the beast"". 
* It may be only me but having someone tell me to calm down is actually worse. the ""presence"" is more useful. Both your hands on her shoulders with a tiny pressure might help her (works for me) feel more grounded and ""protected"". and with a calming voice tell her to breathe. (the exercise above)."

mentalillness,flv9fbe,t1_flv4v3b,1585519129.0,Thank you for your support. It means a lot.
mentalillness,flv9255,t3_frc9sw,1585518916.0,"I have social phobia. My progress (only one year in therapy) is absolutely gone. You are not alone. I would love to tell you cheesy things that only people who never felt this would say, but the truth is i don't think you'll believe it. So i'm going to tell you what has kept me going : maybe we are stronger than what people think of us ? What we think of us ? Look at social medias, etc... People are already out of their mind, and it's been two weeks. What is two weeks home alone in our life ? That's child's play!  And now, maybe they'll know. Maybe they'll be less hard on us. so maybe we can too ? Maybe (even if that's hell) we are more resilient to all of this because we've been fighting with ourselves for years. As jack white would say ""I'm already fighting me, so what's another one"". Be strong. And you know what ? tomorrow, i decided that I will be strong for you too."
mentalhealth,fluiwtb,t3_fr65cn,1585503509.0,"I am exactly the same. I left my parents home at 20, moved to the city, got a very important job quite soon. I’m now 33, living in my parents house and not caring about my future or this life. 
I just want to tell you that i understand you and this feeling you have i have it too. You are not alone."
mentalillness,fkuqhh7,t1_fkukqaf,1584554241.0,I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry that you read this message and that i might have triggered anxiety of sadness. I'm so sorry.
mentalillness,fkuqcas,t1_fkujowf,1584554167.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to answer. You guys have shown more support than people who know me. I do that, having social phobia, i always do things by myself. But i was in paris during the attacks, and now this. And no one ever called to see if I'm fine.  I don't think I hurt them,  I just stop answering the phone, because I'm not good enough. And well, this disease is a shitty thing that eats your brain because I push them away, but the fear of dying alone is huge. I actually want to die before my father because he'll be the only one who will care enough to take care of my body. I'm pretty sure my sisters will be relieved the day i leave."
mentalillness,fkupmn6,t1_fkucydi,1584553796.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to write. It means the world. I had that someone, but one of the aspect of my disease is a very low self esteem. I pushed that person away knowing for a fact that i wan't good enough. That person is now married, so i'm pretty sure i was right."
mentalillness,fkupdig,t1_fku8die,1584553666.0,"I tried, they called me ""drama queen"", ""party pooper"". So yeah... I don't think they care about what's in my mind unfortunately."
mentalillness,fkup6z6,t1_fku6ahx,1584553572.0,31 and the biggest failure known to humanity. every thing i try fails. Stay strong.
mentalillness,fkup2lc,t1_fku6s9v,1584553509.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to answer. I'm so glad your safe and happy.
mentalillness,fku5ulb,t1_fku50le,1584542895.0,"My family triggers my most violent panic attacks. But in these times, i tried to call my big sister (who I'm pretty sure never loved me). She spoke to everyone in the family since the outbreak. The second i called, she told me ""I'm busy, are the parents okay?"" then hung up. It's always like this. She always finds a reason to hang up, and never ever calls back. My two sisters and mother are extroverts. I have social phobia on top of being extra shy. For them, I'm just a weirdo. Nothing more. They never let me express my anxiety. They never ask how I feel. When I told them what I had, they did not even search what social phobia means. They have no idea that 70% of us end up killing ourselves, and it's written in black on white everywhere on the internet. I never ever had a call from them asking me how they could help me navigate this. They are in lockdown and complaining because it's been two days, they don't even realize that's it's been my life for as long as i can remember."
mentalillness,fku43fi,t1_fku3ydy,1584541809.0,I tried. No one answered. :(
