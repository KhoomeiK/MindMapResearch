depression,fpoaojm,t3_gea6mo,1588781275.0,"I have NO friends, well I do however I do not hang out with them as much anymore. You know that girl with severe social anxiety and depression and hides in her room all year around and works and goes to school with no social life? Hi that’s me! Yes I do get lonely, however, I can’t be friends with people because one I’m too depressed to socialize so I isolate myself, I do not like my appearance. 

Yes these are all my negative thoughts however now I am at a point where I have wasted so many years wanting others outside of myself to feel loved, I am now on a journey of self care mentally physically and emotionally, I am also working on building my personality, never again will I waste my time on this earth, we are here for temporary experiences nothing is forever so I’m here to enjoy with friends or without. Do not get me wrong I do get lonely however I have a lot of internal issues I would like to work on before I can interact with others and heal from emotional trauma I understand I will truly not ever be 100% healed and I must also accept my flaws and my beauties. 

I have met a lot of new people recently and my energy has completely changed by exercise and meditation, I been dating new guys, I have this one guy to thank he was there for me at work at a time I was truly going through a dark coma I have never told him this however he has pulled me from it just by being in my proximity, yes I was incredibly lonely and depressed at the time and off my medication so I was incredibly emotionally vulnerable which was the true me however medication is like a bandaid although I do not really like anti depressants it makes life a little more tolerable with my handle of my emotions , he would come and talk to me everyday at work and my anxiety was through the roof around him I was so nervous because he was very charming but I am grateful to him because he pulled me out of a dark place and inspired me to live again, he truly did I wanted to tell him how he made me feel however I didn’t want to scare him, he made me want to live again and reminded me to get back on track with exercise and meditation which I stopped before meeting him because I was having a depressive episode. I am learning ballet, salsa, belly dance, also studying mandarin soon. He inspired me so much and for that I call him a friend,"

1. Definitely begin an exercise routine I would say high intensity workout, also exercise outside in nature because it’s great for your mind
2. Meditation helps in living in the present for your mood etc
3. Eat fish, chicken, vegetables and fruit"

dating_advice,forrqa0,t3_g91tly,1588017353.0,"It also has to do with mentality at the moment. I’m having trouble figuring out what I want, I know I can’t handle FWB relationships or hookups. I had one hook up with one guy and I got attached and hated how I felt afterwards I was an emotional wreck for like 1-2 years lol. Then I had a casual BF, that was fun however I wasn’t as emotionally invested and got bored and broke up with him. Now there is a guy I like and he wants sex without feelings but I actually like him
Emotionally and physically however I didn’t do anything with him, it sucks I try not to take it personal, he calls my wishy washy because sometimes I want to hook up with him because I’m lonely and want to satisfy my physical urges however then I want him emotionally like the cuddles and massages, and to hang out together and something romantic. I don’t know what I want, maybe I need to find a balance and just have a casual hook up guy and then a guy we both feel emotionally connected to, but then relationships are so much work and I get bored lol this sucks because I still crave intimacy 😑 someone help"

It takes a lot of strength to get out of such arrangements especially when there are emotions involved.
dating_advice,forhfbs,t1_fora8mj,1588012281.0,"YES! I feel the same way, and here is the thing I wasn’t even looking to date anyone at the time, I’m still in Uni and I just wanted to enjoy being single after breaking up with this other guy I dated causally for a year. This guy,  HE came onto me and I didn’t expect it he caught me off guard at the time and I was emotionally vulnerable  and allowed him in. He asked me for a date and I rejected his invitations because I wasn’t ready, okay I was possibly at fault somewhere here however, he then offered me something physical after I rejected his invitation for a date stating I could use him for sex, I told him no and that we could be friends this was back in December. Afterwards, he was persistently flirting with me asked me to hang out with him and play video games, asked me to a concert, but I couldn’t deny him because we worked together and I did enjoy his attention because he was handsome and very charming. I was flattered and I caught feels for him somewhere, before we even did anything physical (we never did kiss or have sex btw), I was falling for him we texted for two months straight and he invited me over for Valentine’s Day for a shrimp dinner. He would tease me saying “you could have a boyfriend right here” referring to himself, I was surprised and he even told me he liked me but he begun pulling away once he left the job and the basically stated , “hey until I’m back on my feet we should just stay friends” and I said “ummm we been friends what the heck do you mean?” And he said “stop the flirting parts lmao” . Anyway I liked him however I seemed like a nutcase lol for asking him out after only knowing him for 2 months but I couldn’t resist his charm, he was polite and rejected me stating the same thing again “let’s just remain as friends I’m broke and suicidal af, I’m fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can’t date with my life being crap like this we can stay friends platonic only” however he still wanted to sleep with me I told him to freak off lol because I knew I’d end up hurt because I was into him physically and emotionally however he just wanted me physically without a relationship, I told him to make a tinder and get out of here lol and he said “no I don’t want to hook up with random chicks” 

My thing is, if he was ALL in, and if I was his ideal girl he would have took me off the market to date and be intimate with, however he liked me BUT he wasn’t in love with me and dying to date me. So that’s that, until I meet a guy that is dying to date me lol I’m not sleeping with anyone 100% that’s my standards and terms no compromise. And until then I’m working on myself physically, mentally, and my personality. I’m learning ballet, salsa and belly dancing, and probably fix something’s with my appearance but that’s that. 

I swear some guys are selfish, it’s like they want the girl to like them and they get off by sleeping with a girl that is into them and like seeing her enjoy herself with him however he isn’t even emotionally there or isn’t fully committed to you all the way and will use you for sex, however, if you just want sex then get a prostitute but NOPE that isn’t what SOME of them want, as I said what they WANT is a girl to be into them and sleep with them because they enjoy the devotion, ego boost, and attention while not wanting to commit to her fully because they aren’t THAT into her, it’s like they like HER but it isn’t ENOUGH for him to commit fully if that makes sense. Smh anyway I’m enjoying my single life he is dismissed and I’m glad he didn’t get anything from me LOL. But I wish you the best sorry for the long reply I just needed to vent"

Up arrangement and I was like “ooop I’m out”. I just don’t like the idea of being used physically when I know the guy emotionally, my pride and ego gets in the way. I also can’t even do one night stands I’ll feel used and disgusted with myself I just don’t like it however that is just me"
dating_advice,folahq2,t1_fol90ob,1587858131.0,"He rejected me later. Allow me to explain, so everyday during December and January he would approach me and talk to me, and flirt with me, also invite me to hang out with him, and also asked me for a date again, and asked me to a concert. But I kept turning him down, I was recovering emotionally from a break up, and was in a dark place myself, anyway he invited me to come over for a movie night and I agreed for the week of valentines. And he cuddled me and kissed my cheeks, and he brought us a shrimp dinner. And then eventually, the day after valentines he lost his job and said “until I am back on my feet we should just stay as friends” and I said “umm we been friends what do you even mean?” And he said “stop the flirting parts lmao” so then okay, weeks go by and he begins pulling away and just doesn’t talk with me as much, but then the first or second week of March, he asked me to come over and give him a lap dance and I encouraged the situation and then he said “I would have been sent you nudes in your DMs, but you were all like I don’t know if that is a good idea” so then I saw his nudes and got excited and asked him out without thinking because boy did he look delicious lol, so then he rejected me and basically said the same thing and he stated “haven’t we had this convo already and he said I’m broke and I’m suicidal af. I mean I’m fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can’t date while my life is shit like this, we can stay friends platonic only” so then yeah that is rejection? But he is still trying to sleep with me? I was confused and basically I got emotional and blocked him, but then unblocked him two days later I actually think back that I was crazy for asking him out so soon and after his explicit videos and him telling me he just wanted to be friends but idk that’s the story, also we didn’t go out on dates so maybe I looked like a crazy girl idk, but I liked him and now we don’t even talk as much it sucks but I have to move on. Yes he did reject me and I ruined it."

AskWomen,fmr7vw0,t3_fwizp8,1586315968.0,"I had two relationships prior to this one, the first one was a narcissist lying devil who had a fiancé overseas. We were from two different cultural backgrounds, I was young and naive and thought he loved me however my gut was telling me something isn’t right however I fell head over heels in love with him only to be told he was leaving and he’d be back with me in two months and he had to block me on WhatsApp. So then I created another account on WhatsApp with another number only to see he had a image of him married to another woman, I broke down and entered a deep depression and developed anxiety and trust issues and had to receive therapy. Anyway he came back and I tried so hard to be strong and we would argue so much in the messages I told him to f-off multiple times and blocked and unblocked him, he showed up to my house we had to call the police he showed up
To my university and I called security. Anyway the final day I seen him and told him to F off and cried and went to class with a hole in my heart, i blocked him and got over him through therapy and telling my younger sister. Then he messaged me 2 years later reaching out I told him to get lost and go back to his wife with a fake profile from Facebook. My next relationship was a FWB situation/relationship the boy was immature and depressive and just a weed head I didn’t like him so I cut that off in a year we remained friends although he can be really clingy expecting us to get back together which won’t happen. This takes me to the current guy,

After my break up with the clingy guy, this guy approached me at work asking me for a date in which I rejected him and then he told me to use him for sex, I told him “no I cannot do that” and he said “I have a big thing” and I said “umm no but we can be friends” anyway he’d come and speak to me everyday to the point I developed feelings for him, I wouldn’t say I’m head over heels in love with him but I feel something towards him, he would tell me he’s depressed and lonely and that he hates feeling unloved so he has sex to fill a void, myself being empathetic would listen and he would ask me for a date again and to a concert I was going through a lot with my own insecurities and mental state (I still am although I’m coping and combating it with exercise, meditation, journaling etc) I noticed I have a hard time being assertive and setting boundaries, anyway I can tell he is just after sex and he told me he has an on and off FWB that he told his family is his girl so I told him to f-off because obviously if he is telling his family that is his girl then it’s his girl, I been to his house 4 times where I met his aunt and cousin, he’s fooling around with multiple girls and has commitment issues, just wants sex, immature, has depression, I know he doesn’t love me. Anyway myself being set in my emotions towards him I asked him out after he sent me nudes/videos and he rejected me stating “haven’t we been through this convo? I’m suicidal af I am fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can’t date while my life is shit like this, we can stay friends platonic only” and then I got upset and then I said “sorry for bringing it up here as your friend” then he said “I’m sorry” I said “no that’s okay you go do you” so then he said “wow I feel awkward my pe*** is out there” I said “well you put it out there to be exposed” and then he tried to get me to come over to make brownies with him and said “hey still want to do brownies” and I said “I gave you pasta and brownies the other day” then he said “who hurt you so much to be like this?” And I said “anyway I thought I gave you two packs of brownies the other day?” And he said “those fake kid brownies?” I said “but you probably ate them though that is the last time I bring you a snack lol” and he said “that’s a lie” I said “want to bet?” And then he sent me some memes and he said “I’m really hurt about these brownies” and I said “good now leave me alone” and he said “awww are you mad I rejected you? Ruddddee” and I said “yeah I’m mad but I understand your reasons I just hope you will be okay as your friend anyway you have to leave me alone for now. All the best” and then he said “ooof” and then I left him on read and an hour later he sent me a nude and I said “ummm no” and BLOCKED. 

A friend wrote (I mean it sounds like you messed up there imo. He wanted to make it a fwb sort of situation so he could feel something but not have to commit, and judging by the fact you asked him out you liked him too, so you could've just stayed as friends who would sext and flirt and fuck without any feelings. But when you showed feelings he realised that that wouldnt work so he just wanted to be normal friends. I still dont get why you blocked him unless it was your own embarrassment) 

After all of this being emotional and not strong enough I unblocked him a week later after crying to my friends and sister about it my sister said maybe you should just unblock him and express yourself so I did and then he said “this isn’t how I feel but its funny this is my favorite song and it’s our situation.” And then I said “true” and then he said “I’m not worth your time anyway you know when you hear about those broke dudes? But they are charming and they have great d***” and then I wrote an entire message and then he said “you’d probably end up hurt” so then I said “I get it. Do you. And I’ll do me. I’ll leave you alone now that everything is clear.” The next day he messaged me saying “I’m mad you blocked me” and I said “we are both mad it’s okay” and he said “look I’m sorry I didn’t fall for you” then he was trying to put the rejection on me and stating he didn’t know how to love, he was stating I was trying to hard to fit where I don’t. I told him to F off! 

But like an idiot I went over there a week later giving him brownies. Huh. Then we texted again, then I went over there again 4 days ago. I’m not going over there anymore. I’m leaving him alone. It’s obvious he just wants sex. Also he has another on/off FWB he probably keeps in rotation and is emotionally connected with and he told his family that is his girl and he didn’t want he and I to be intimate at his place so his family wouldn’t think he was a cheater and laughed about it, I said “umm do you think that is funny? If you have a gf” and he said “I don’t, the girl has a BF” anyway 

I can’t help but think I was too ugly for him to fall for me, my personality is lacking substance, social skills are lacking, and low self esteem and self confidence. Anyway his issues are His depression,  commitment issues, immaturity, home wrecker, and probably addicted to sex 

He and I have never been intimate I’m leaving him alone if he wants me he will come to me I’m not coming to him anymore I’m done, I want to self improve and heal anyway mentally and emotionally just so GLAD we were never intimate"
dating_advice,fm4etqj,t1_fm4ecen,1585752731.0,"It wasn’t that I didn’t like him, it was more so because I was going through a difficult time with school, stress, and just low self esteem so I reject guys that take interest in me because I feel
I can’t be present on a date with them so what’s the point of dating if I am not ready? Or what’s the point of going out on a date when my focus is elsewhere you know? I did like him physically when he approached me, however, I was honest with him and told him I didn’t want to date. He asked me for a date twice, and also asked me to go to a concert with him.
