You know that girl with severe social anxiety and depression and hides in her room all year around and works and goes to school with no social life? Hi that‚Äôs me! Yes I do get lonely, however, I can‚Äôt be friends with people because one I‚Äôm too depressed to socialize so I isolate myself, I do not like my appearance. 

Yes these are all my negative thoughts however now I am at a point where I have wasted so many years wanting others outside of myself to feel loved, I am now on a journey of self care mentally physically and emotionally, I am also working on building my personality, never again will I waste my time on this earth, we are here for temporary experiences nothing is forever so I‚Äôm here to enjoy with friends or without. Do not get me wrong I do get lonely however I have a lot of internal issues I would like to work on before I can interact with others and heal from emotional trauma I understand I will truly not ever be 100% healed and I must also accept my flaws and my beauties. 

I have met a lot of new people recently and my energy has completely changed by exercise and meditation, I been dating new guys, I have this one guy to thank he was there for me at work at a time I was truly going through a dark coma I have never told him this however he has pulled me from it just by being in my proximity, yes I was incredibly lonely and depressed at the time and off my medication so I was incredibly emotionally vulnerable which was the true me however medication is like a bandaid although I do not really like anti depressants it makes life a little more tolerable with my handle of my emotions , he would come and talk to me everyday at work and my anxiety was through the roof around him I was so nervous because he was very charming but I am grateful to him because he pulled me out of a dark place and inspired me to live again, he truly did I wanted to tell him how he made me feel however I didn‚Äôt want to scare him, he made me want to live again and reminded me to get back on track with exercise and meditation which I stopped before meeting him because I was having a depressive episode. I am learning ballet, salsa, belly dance, also studying mandarin soon. He inspired me so much and for that I call him a friend,"

Emotionally and physically however I didn‚Äôt do anything with him, it sucks I try not to take it personal, he calls my wishy washy because sometimes I want to hook up with him because I‚Äôm lonely and want to satisfy my physical urges however then I want him emotionally like the cuddles and massages, and to hang out together and something romantic.

dating_advice,forhfbs,t1_fora8mj,1588012281.0,"YES! I feel the same way, and here is the thing I wasn‚Äôt even looking to date anyone at the time, I‚Äôm still in Uni and I just wanted to enjoy being single after breaking up with this other guy I dated causally for a year. This guy,  HE came onto me and I didn‚Äôt expect it he caught me off guard at the time and I was emotionally vulnerable  and allowed him in. He asked me for a date and I rejected his invitations because I wasn‚Äôt ready, okay I was possibly at fault somewhere here however, he then offered me something physical after I rejected his invitation for a date stating I could use him for sex, I told him no and that we could be friends this was back in December. Afterwards, he was persistently flirting with me asked me to hang out with him and play video games, asked me to a concert, but I couldn‚Äôt deny him because we worked together and I did enjoy his attention because he was handsome and very charming. I was flattered and I caught feels for him somewhere, before we even did anything physical (we never did kiss or have sex btw), I was falling for him we texted for two months straight and he invited me over for Valentine‚Äôs Day for a shrimp dinner. He would tease me saying ‚Äúyou could have a boyfriend right here‚Äù referring to himself, I was surprised and he even told me he liked me but he begun pulling away once he left the job and the basically stated , ‚Äúhey until I‚Äôm back on my feet we should just stay friends‚Äù and I said ‚Äúummm we been friends what the heck do you mean?‚Äù And he said ‚Äústop the flirting parts lmao‚Äù . Anyway I liked him however I seemed like a nutcase lol for asking him out after only knowing him for 2 months but I couldn‚Äôt resist his charm, he was polite and rejected me stating the same thing again ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just remain as friends I‚Äôm broke and suicidal af, I‚Äôm fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can‚Äôt date with my life being crap like this we can stay friends platonic only‚Äù however he still wanted to sleep with me I told him to freak off lol because I knew I‚Äôd end up hurt because I was into him physically and emotionally however he just wanted me physically without a relationship, I told him to make a tinder and get out of here lol and he said ‚Äúno I don‚Äôt want to hook up with random chicks‚Äù 

My thing is, if he was ALL in, and if I was his ideal girl he would have took me off the market to date and be intimate with, however he liked me BUT he wasn‚Äôt in love with me and dying to date me. So that‚Äôs that, until I meet a guy that is dying to date me lol I‚Äôm not sleeping with anyone 100% that‚Äôs my standards and terms no compromise. And until then I‚Äôm working on myself physically, mentally, and my personality. I‚Äôm learning ballet, salsa and belly dancing, and probably fix something‚Äôs with my appearance but that‚Äôs that. 

I swear some guys are selfish, it‚Äôs like they want the girl to like them and they get off by sleeping with a girl that is into them and like seeing her enjoy herself with him however he isn‚Äôt even emotionally there or isn‚Äôt fully committed to you all the way and will use you for sex, however, if you just want sex then get a prostitute but NOPE that isn‚Äôt what SOME of them want, as I said what they WANT is a girl to be into them and sleep with them because they enjoy the devotion, ego boost, and attention while not wanting to commit to her fully because they aren‚Äôt THAT into her, it‚Äôs like they like HER but it isn‚Äôt ENOUGH for him to commit fully if that makes sense. Smh anyway I‚Äôm enjoying my single life he is dismissed and I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt get anything from me LOL. But I wish you the best sorry for the long reply I just needed to vent"

dating_advice,folahq2,t1_fol90ob,1587858131.0,"He rejected me later. Allow me to explain, so everyday during December and January he would approach me and talk to me, and flirt with me, also invite me to hang out with him, and also asked me for a date again, and asked me to a concert. But I kept turning him down, I was recovering emotionally from a break up, and was in a dark place myself, anyway he invited me to come over for a movie night and I agreed for the week of valentines. And he cuddled me and kissed my cheeks, and he brought us a shrimp dinner. And then eventually, the day after valentines he lost his job and said ‚Äúuntil I am back on my feet we should just stay as friends‚Äù and I said ‚Äúumm we been friends what do you even mean?‚Äù And he said ‚Äústop the flirting parts lmao‚Äù so then okay, weeks go by and he begins pulling away and just doesn‚Äôt talk with me as much, but then the first or second week of March, he asked me to come over and give him a lap dance and I encouraged the situation and then he said ‚ÄúI would have been sent you nudes in your DMs, but you were all like I don‚Äôt know if that is a good idea‚Äù so then I saw his nudes and got excited and asked him out without thinking because boy did he look delicious lol, so then he rejected me and basically said the same thing and he stated ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt we had this convo already and he said I‚Äôm broke and I‚Äôm suicidal af. I mean I‚Äôm fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can‚Äôt date while my life is shit like this, we can stay friends platonic only‚Äù so then yeah that is rejection? But he is still trying to sleep with me? I was confused and basically I got emotional and blocked him, but then unblocked him two days later I actually think back that I was crazy for asking him out so soon and after his explicit videos and him telling me he just wanted to be friends but idk that‚Äôs the story, also we didn‚Äôt go out on dates so maybe I looked like a crazy girl idk, but I liked him and now we don‚Äôt even talk as much it sucks but I have to move on.

AskWomen,fmr7vw0,t3_fwizp8,1586315968.0,"I had two relationships prior to this one, the first one was a narcissist lying devil who had a fianc√© overseas. We were from two different cultural backgrounds, I was young and naive and thought he loved me however my gut was telling me something isn‚Äôt right however I fell head over heels in love with him only to be told he was leaving and he‚Äôd be back with me in two months and he had to block me on WhatsApp. So then I created another account on WhatsApp with another number only to see he had a image of him married to another woman, I broke down and entered a deep depression and developed anxiety and trust issues and had to receive therapy. Anyway he came back and I tried so hard to be strong and we would argue so much in the messages I told him to f-off multiple times and blocked and unblocked him, he showed up to my house we had to call the police he showed up
To my university and I called security. Anyway the final day I seen him and told him to F off and cried and went to class with a hole in my heart, i blocked him and got over him through therapy and telling my younger sister. Then he messaged me 2 years later reaching out I told him to get lost and go back to his wife with a fake profile from Facebook. My next relationship was a FWB situation/relationship the boy was immature and depressive and just a weed head I didn‚Äôt like him so I cut that off in a year we remained friends although he can be really clingy expecting us to get back together which won‚Äôt happen. This takes me to the current guy,

After my break up with the clingy guy, this guy approached me at work asking me for a date in which I rejected him and then he told me to use him for sex, I told him ‚Äúno I cannot do that‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúI have a big thing‚Äù and I said ‚Äúumm no but we can be friends‚Äù anyway he‚Äôd come and speak to me everyday to the point I developed feelings for him, I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm head over heels in love with him but I feel something towards him, he would tell me he‚Äôs depressed and lonely and that he hates feeling unloved so he has sex to fill a void, myself being empathetic would listen and he would ask me for a date again and to a concert I was going through a lot with my own insecurities and mental state (I still am although I‚Äôm coping and combating it with exercise, meditation, journaling etc) I noticed I have a hard time being assertive and setting boundaries, anyway I can tell he is just after sex and he told me he has an on and off FWB that he told his family is his girl so I told him to f-off because obviously if he is telling his family that is his girl then it‚Äôs his girl, I been to his house 4 times where I met his aunt and cousin, he‚Äôs fooling around with multiple girls and has commitment issues, just wants sex, immature, has depression, I know he doesn‚Äôt love me. Anyway myself being set in my emotions towards him I asked him out after he sent me nudes/videos and he rejected me stating ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt we been through this convo? I‚Äôm suicidal af I am fine if you want to stop the flirting parts but I can‚Äôt date while my life is shit like this, we can stay friends platonic only‚Äù and then I got upset and then I said ‚Äúsorry for bringing it up here as your friend‚Äù then he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù I said ‚Äúno that‚Äôs okay you go do you‚Äù so then he said ‚Äúwow I feel awkward my pe*** is out there‚Äù I said ‚Äúwell you put it out there to be exposed‚Äù and then he tried to get me to come over to make brownies with him and said ‚Äúhey still want to do brownies‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI gave you pasta and brownies the other day‚Äù then he said ‚Äúwho hurt you so much to be like this?‚Äù And I said ‚Äúanyway I thought I gave you two packs of brownies the other day?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúthose fake kid brownies?‚Äù I said ‚Äúbut you probably ate them though that is the last time I bring you a snack lol‚Äù and he said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a lie‚Äù I said ‚Äúwant to bet?‚Äù And then he sent me some memes and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really hurt about these brownies‚Äù and I said ‚Äúgood now leave me alone‚Äù and he said ‚Äúawww are you mad I rejected you? Ruddddee‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm mad but I understand your reasons I just hope you will be okay as your friend anyway you have to leave me alone for now. All the best‚Äù and then he said ‚Äúooof‚Äù and then I left him on read and an hour later he sent me a nude and I said ‚Äúummm no‚Äù and BLOCKED. 

A friend wrote (I mean it sounds like you messed up there imo. He wanted to make it a fwb sort of situation so he could feel something but not have to commit, and judging by the fact you asked him out you liked him too, so you could've just stayed as friends who would sext and flirt and fuck without any feelings. But when you showed feelings he realised that that wouldnt work so he just wanted to be normal friends. I still dont get why you blocked him unless it was your own embarrassment) 

After all of this being emotional and not strong enough I unblocked him a week later after crying to my friends and sister about it my sister said maybe you should just unblock him and express yourself so I did and then he said ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt how I feel but its funny this is my favorite song and it‚Äôs our situation.‚Äù And then I said ‚Äútrue‚Äù and then he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worth your time anyway you know when you hear about those broke dudes? But they are charming and they have great d***‚Äù and then I wrote an entire message and then he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôd probably end up hurt‚Äù so then I said ‚ÄúI get it. Do you. And I‚Äôll do me. I‚Äôll leave you alone now that everything is clear.‚Äù The next day he messaged me saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad you blocked me‚Äù and I said ‚Äúwe are both mad it‚Äôs okay‚Äù and he said ‚Äúlook I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt fall for you‚Äù then he was trying to put the rejection on me and stating he didn‚Äôt know how to love, he was stating I was trying to hard to fit where I don‚Äôt. I told him to F off! 

But like an idiot I went over there a week later giving him brownies. Huh. Then we texted again, then I went over there again 4 days ago. I‚Äôm not going over there anymore. I‚Äôm leaving him alone. It‚Äôs obvious he just wants sex. Also he has another on/off FWB he probably keeps in rotation and is emotionally connected with and he told his family that is his girl and he didn‚Äôt want he and I to be intimate at his place so his family wouldn‚Äôt think he was a cheater and laughed about it, I said ‚Äúumm do you think that is funny? If you have a gf‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, the girl has a BF‚Äù anyway 

I can‚Äôt help but think I was too ugly for him to fall for me, my personality is lacking substance, social skills are lacking, and low self esteem and self confidence. Anyway his issues are His depression,  commitment issues, immaturity, home wrecker, and probably addicted to sex 

He and I have never been intimate I‚Äôm leaving him alone if he wants me he will come to me I‚Äôm not coming to him anymore I‚Äôm done, I want to self improve and heal anyway mentally and emotionally just so GLAD we were never intimate"
