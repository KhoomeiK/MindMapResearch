techsupport,fqrkzgc,t1_fqrjnnb,1589586475.0,"Again, I'm not getting forced shutdowns. What happens is I close my PC or tend to put it on sleep and forget about it, go to sleep, and the next day I get this problem. That's why I am sure it has something to do with sleep mode. It doesn't do this if I put it into sleep and then come back a few hours later. The reason why I can't pin point exactly is because this PC also goes to sleep automatically, so I can't tell if I messed up or not. I am going to try to disable automatic sleep mode or sleep mode overall and go from there.

Also, the connection theory is wrong. I tried turning off the power for a few minutes and then turning on, nothing.

I might run some HDD scans, I was afraid it would break, but after that chkdsk scan it started behaving well. Last time I checked with CrystalDisk the read/write speeds were normal.

Also I sold my old GPU, you know? And my bad with that phrase, I skipped an important part. Along with the GPU switch I also switched the motherboard. So that was a shitty thing to say. I only used the old GPU with the new mobo for a very short time. After that I switched. I meant in that period of time I had no issues.

Also of course I consider this motherboard cheap. The CPU mobo RAM combo cost me 100$. The motherboard has a broken sensor that always displays an error message on bootup. However this doesn't affect my issue, since that would mean it would be on every boot up. And the censor is meaningless, I'm not sure what it even monitors, something CPU related, but I can still read temps and speeds just fine.

What a headache. I thought this would be more common, apparently not."

I kind of agree. Putting too much power into bot lane would only return it to a coinflip bot meta. Unfun for both the losing bot lane and the rest of the team. Imagine playing other roles and winning just because of your bot lane and not anybody else.

Right now though, the influence order is: mid jungle top support adc, maybe sometimes even switch support with top. I expect to see some support nerfs and maybe some nerfs to objectives, as I feel like jungle XP is finally ok."

Also buff ADC XP. Maybe make it so that the guy with the support item gets less XP and the ADC gets solo lane XP level? Idk how. But go from there. If the game does back to a coinflip bot lane era then maybe rework the class.

Of course it does lol?

A level 3 J4 will be far less tanky and do less damage to you as well. Hell you could even kill him if you had minions and the right champ. And you're talking as if junglers don't have rights to get XP or smth and they are just a slave to solo laners or a secondary support. That's a shitty way to look at it.

> does it make a difference to you if the 11/0 ashe with 4 items is level 13 or level 15? 

And yes it does make a difference, because a level 13 Ashe with no matter how many items gets one shot by a level 15 mage, and a level 15 Ashe gets one shot by a level 17 mage as well. ADC's don't get tankier as the game goes on, you know?

Or those that troll pick.

They could prevent this type of dodging easily. Here are some of my suggestions:

1) Give less LP losses for losing games with poorly performing teammates. The loss should be exponential to your own performance. This can obviously be abused (KDA players or whatever) but they can make algorithms to work around that.

2) Revert the dodge system, but make continuous dodges more forgiving. For example, I dodge once, then after 3 games I wanna dodge again. The penalty should be back to -3LP 6 minutes queue cooldown. But if I dodge once and only after a game I dodge it should be -10 30 minute cooldown. You should have a small penalty but only after avoiding to dodge for so long.

3) While we are at it, just make a dodge button. It's kind of obvious why people ""accidentally close their clients"". Do it so I won't have to open the game again."

And 3 headshots takes like 10 strikes because he always blocks them. In the meantime I get harassed by his other companions.

2)  Uuuh, did you even play the game? It clearly says that if you lose a bandit camp raid you get imprisoned AND lose all your troops. And idk if bandits even get out of there.

3) Yes 3 renown/tournament. Don't know how much a quest gives, probably not much. That is garbage. Raiding a medium wealth village gives 10 renown, morale, influence and a shit ton of money and food. And if you want 150 renown you need 50 tournaments. You are insane my man. :D

4) I won 4 empire tournaments and yes their gear for the tournament is nice. What you receive however is FAR from what you said. IDK what game you played man, I got 2 maces and a god damn camel. Combined they sold for around 500. In 3 tournaments.

5) Yes but for the early game it is far too expensive to do that, considering how little you get. Only after raiding for a few hours I got enough horses. And I still don't have enough for my full capacity.

6) Poachers hideout is NOT for the early game. 20 men aren't enough if at least half of them are not upgraded to good tiers. I haven't gotten sell off mercenaries yet.

7) I have those. NPC's block every hit. It's obnoxious. It takes forever to take down one.

8) No I can't catch my ""queen"" because she goes missing for 5 days and idk her location cause it doesn't update on the encyclopedia. And wdym smaller army?

And yes let me just whip out 15000 gold for a caravan so I can make some money consistently. That's too expensive.. 

9) And what is kingdom balance? LOL Literally all the other kingdoms are completely butt naked exposed, except the ones on the margins.

Like how delusional are people like you that think of something and after a period of time treat it like it ACTUALLY happened? Did you forget you're just assuming things? Nothing you say is fucking real. Nothing.

The only truth to what you say is that the government is denying origins. Hence it has spread so much. That has been confirmed. Anything else? No."

I don't give a shit about China numbers, but assuming stuff out of your asshole for internet attention is something I do care about. Because people take it for granted. When it's not confirmed to be real."

dankmemes,fm0f4r8,t1_fm0ezuh,1585655832.0,It's a meme so it's fine to contain misinformation. ?? You forget that people believe anything they say on the internet and then go and spread that exact same information to others.
dankmemes,fm0e6jc,t1_fm0dznv,1585654939.0,"Yea but it implies almost all of them were. Which is straight absurd. Considering it's such a large population and in a condensed area it's complete non sense. And I'm sure this started as a rumor from a citizen. I can too easily pull up news and numbers up my ass and feel better about myself telling the world fake but ""interesting"" shit. It's not funny."

leagueoflegends,flz5xm3,t3_fruq32,1585616238.0,"I think that if both teams ban Wukong you should still be able to pick him. He is quite underwhelming when nobody can play him. And if you manage to pick him through 2 bans, in your next game Wukong bans should be forbidden. Only then we might start seeing this champion, until then we need more data to analyze his performance in solo queue."
Animemes,flvqdy6,t1_fluupg4,1585529648.0,Because you do it just because your body demands it. You do it on routine. It's not like being 12 14 discovering it for the first time. It's not exciting to see other people fuck. It's not exciting to see drawings. Yet you use them for your own imagination so you and your bidy feel a little bit better. You live in a fake world where you tame your mind to believe fictional pleasure. And if you're like me you start feeling pathetic cause you're so lonely you resort to this. You consider your age and you start thinking where it all wrong. Why are you so lonely and why you haven't interacted and developed a sexual life. All because your animal being wants to fuck ti continue your species. All because you like women. Or men. But nothing is real. You are desperate. And so contemplating reveals some issues.
leagueoflegends,flgb7iq,t3_fok966,1585137658.0,"ADC have carry level damage so I'd say it's no surprise they have a weakness. If your team doesn't help you live then they deserve to lose. If your team peels you then you should be able to output the most DPS in a fight. The class is not weak at all. If you're having bad experiences with it, there are plenty of ways to adjust, a lot of ADC mains are high rank, so you could learn a thing or two. Some games are just impossible to win as an ADC, but so applies with every role."
leagueoflegends,flczo5s,t1_flbhb83,1585052437.0,Ekko has Talon level play rate but lower win rate especially in higher elos. He isn't broken right now but if any other assassins get nerfed sure.

depression,fl7r67o,t3_fn1vc8,1584907627.0,I wouldn't relate the pandemic to loneliness. Most social people with friends hop onto discord skype  facebook whatever and just chat all day. Pretty sure your problem also existed before this quarantine started. Loneliness is a motherfucker for everyone. Find yourself into something to do and forget. The internet is big.
leagueoflegends,fl7qq1h,t1_fl7npa3,1584907356.0,"He sounds pretty butt hurt to me, it got obvious the moment he said people take tenacity runes on Ekko and he is immortal. His ult CD isn't that far off from a Zed/Talon ult CD and I don't think it's the problem. People are butthurt Ekko can one shot and get away with him. Most assassins can tbf. I wouldn't mind if Ekko R got nerfed so people could sleep at night."

depression,fksdbox,t3_fkaiqz,1584487528.0,"The real world is so cruel you rely on fictional hope to get you through another day. You live the next day because of a hypothetical belief and self trust that comes from your human blood. You silently watch as all your hope dies everyday yet it always comes back and never leaves. Humans were made to withstand pain and darkness yet we all lose light. 

It's beautiful. And even the darkest soul becomes childish with sensuality. Just like that. 

It's a battle where only time can say the answer. Yet we all believe we can do something. I like Dark's idea (the netflix show): zeit ist gott. (time is God).

Now if you will excuse me I need to sleep. Bye."

First of all, you're ruining the peace and competitive atmosphere by typing in a FOREIGN language, second of all, you're also flaming and spamming sentences after every single thing that happens? That must've been so infuriating for all of his teammates. Imagine a guy in your game dies level 3 and he just starts saying 视频达斯达克q我们22了asdasd凹陷 JG DIFF GG or some shit. It's a real tilter.
