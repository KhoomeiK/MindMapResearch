animalcrossingturnips,fp01jrf,t3_gaiwgd,1588200750.0,Internet crashed! New Dodo code is JBF8R. Still good to sell.
TFABLinePorn,fmpxhzq,t3_fwprnw,1586289124.0,"I also had a nasty Pregmate indent this month. I woke up the next morning with AF in tow, who so graciously showed up a few days early. It was before I could even test again, so at least I didn’t waste another one I guess 😂"
Anxiety,fleww64,t1_flevv88,1585093168.0,Happy to help ❤️
Anxiety,fle2wxp,t1_fldxgot,1585076589.0,"SAME. I kept convincing myself I had a fever last week, but every time I took my temp it was somewhere between 97.5-98.1. Then I went over to my husband like “TaKE yOur temPerATuRe I tHinK THis Is BRoKen” 😂"
TryingForABaby,fjkwp6x,t3_fdkwla,1583435399.0,"Literally pulled up this subreddit today to see if anyone else was at this stage. It sucks and I’m sorry to hear you’re at this point in your cycle too, but at least we’re not alone ❤️

Fingers crossed for our next cycles!"
TFABLinePorn,fiuu60r,t1_fiuog52,1582748327.0,"Aww, I understand! My husband and I are trying for our first, but he has a 5yo daughter that we’re dying to give a sibling to.

Keep us updated 🤞🏼🤞🏼"
TFABLinePorn,fiuktok,t3_f9xzro,1582743304.0,I see it! 🤞🏼
Peripheryband,fitj601,t1_fissnxg,1582721668.0,On it
trollingforababy,firnbtk,t3_f9hkhy,1582667648.0,Dying 😂😂😂
TFABLinePorn,fgrk7ww,t3_ew6gyx,1581048935.0,Update: Must have been a dye run. AF came today. Maybe next month ☺️
TFABLinePorn,fgfjonz,t1_fgf9wqp,1580740583.0,"I deleted my post because I think it was a little confusing, lol. But I’ll definitely update everyone in a few days! 🤞🏼"
TFABLinePorn,fgea0pd,t1_fge8tek,1580694797.0,"Nope, this is mine from today! The one he peed on was an Up & Up test from Target."
TFABLinePorn,fge3qto,t1_fge2i82,1580690676.0,"I wish I had looked at this subreddit more before even testing with one! I honestly had no idea. I was (and still am) feeling very off so I decided to test with an FRER anyway, and while it’s hard to see in the picture, there is a very faint pink line in person. Still not getting my hopes up ☺️"
TFABLinePorn,fg11a8r,t1_fg0c60o,1580418945.0,"For sure. I was mostly shocked to see anything at all based on when I thought I ovulated, but at this point who knows when I actually did. I’m not getting my hopes up quite yet :)"
TFABLinePorn,fg0k5o0,t1_fg0hcct,1580409432.0,"Glad I’m not the only one! I had my stepdaughter with me so I just grabbed a couple of boxes off the shelf really quickly and threw them in the cart 😂

Congratulations to you!!"
TFABLinePorn,fg01eqh,t1_fg011f4,1580398064.0,Definitely will be! And I’ll be getting pink dye tests for next time. This was actually a moment of weakness. I’m not exactly sure when I ovulated but if I had to guess I’d say I’m somewhere around 8-9DPO so I wasn’t expecting any results at all 😅
IdiotsInCars,ew7ftow,t1_ew7f5j2,1565191193.0,"YES. I’m going to see them next month for their tour and I. Am. Stoked. I’m sincerely hoping their final/encore song is Satellites, just so they can end the concert with everyone saying “suck my balls” in unison."
IdiotsInCars,ew7ejf6,t3_cn4347,1565190636.0,"Sorry this happened, but I mostly came here to give kudos for your song choice. I love finding fellow Periphery listeners."
AskReddit,ev18bth,t3_ci184y,1564153980.0,"I was a recruiter at the time. I called him about a job, he asked me to meet in-person over coffee to discuss said job. We’re getting married in January ☺️"
Peripheryband,eq0pbi6,t3_bwpswb,1559690642.0,"We’re doing this for our wedding in January! I’m sure we’ll get some looks too, but not using it as our first song is out of the question. Did you just do a ‘normal’ slow dance?"
AskReddit,ep35ere,t1_ep11bvy,1559017542.0,"I grew up in a house across the street from a field and a small commercial building, which had a small gravel road that led from my street to the main road. There was a sign by that road that read “no shortcut”, and I thought that meant they weren’t allowed to cut the grass too short."
