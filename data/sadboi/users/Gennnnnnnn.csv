Yes I probably would struggle to get a job there again but I know I don't want to be in that team so that's ok.  

There's also nothing wrong with taking a job when you're not sure if that's what you want to do. For me personally, I'm only ever sure if i want to do something is after I try it out first. So there's nothing wrong with accepting an offer and giving it a good go for 3 or 6 months, then reevaluating.

I have a number of friends who are psychologists and they are used to dealing with absolutely any situation, so even if it does get awkward (and I hate talking about personal things so I assume it would get awkward), that's completely ok. Just remember that it does take time to recover, so it may take a few sessions before it feels hugely beneficial, but it generally will pay off.

NoStupidQuestions,ezmri1t,t3_d1je5o,1567996069.0,"It's ok to need some down time.  However, if you really don't feel motivated to do anything at all it might be time to reach out to a friend or family member that you trust and let them know what's going on. Also finding self care things that work for you can be helpful, like meditating for a few minutes every day or taking regular breaks at work if possible. Otherwise, I can totally relate to feeling like seeing a therapist is odd and awkward, but it actually really can help a lot if you give it a go and stick with it for a little while. Remember that therapists see people every day who feel odd or silly or awkward being there and they are happy to accept that."
NoStupidQuestions,ezjv1ki,t1_ezjtruz,1567950788.0,"Goodluck! That's a super tough thing to do.  If you're at school, I found talking to a trustee teacher to say that I was worried about a friend and could the teacher talk to them (because I didn't want to share my friends secrets myself) helped. Otherwise, perhaps you could offer to go to the first counsellor session together? Or tell him he can debrief with you afterwards? In my experience, always always being there for a person like you described discouraged them from getting help because they would always come to me (and they even admitted to me that they got attached to feeling down because that's when they got the most attention), so try and avoid that if possible."
NoStupidQuestions,ezjt75a,t3_d1aavv,1567949998.0,"I have been in situation that sounds a little bit similar to yours before. My advice is - always remember that it is not your job to fix someone, even if you desparately want to.  Yes you can support him but if he really is affected by past trauma then he probably should seek professional help rather than relying on you. It can be a slippery slope and gets harder to get out of.
Trust your gut. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't, even if you can't put into words why.
Make sure you set clear boundaries and don't feel bad about sticking to them. You don't owe your friend anything, and if he doesn't respect your boundaries then doesn't deserve your kindness.  It's not helpful in the long run to let people talk you into things you don't want to do, no matter how trivia it seems"

Harry and Baden might make F2 because they don't seem to be targeted as much lately. I'm not sure Abbey will last to F2 - her old alliance won't side with her again and her new alliance might be less loyal to her than the other members who have been working together for a lot longer.

NoStupidQuestions,eyy8bol,t3_czdfai,1567575085.0,"I don't think you really know what major, career etc you want until you try it. My job that I got after uni was quite different to what i imagined. I still enjoyed it but was definitely not what I expected. I also did heaps of volunteer work over the years which exposed me to things I never expected to like, but did. I then transitioned into a different job that I really enjoyed. I never expected to end up in this field, and wouldn't have without giving some different things a go.
So, give some things a try and be kind to yourself while you figure it out. You absolutely don't have to end up in a 'perfect' job straight away, and the chances of that are slim for everyone so give yourself some time and freedom to work it out."
