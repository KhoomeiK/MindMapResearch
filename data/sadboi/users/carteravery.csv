Having virgin hair is ideal for that type of dye but she could still be left with noticeable pigment for a long time. And good wigs that don‚Äôt look like halloween costumes are expensive.

AskReddit,ev8p3kx,t3_cif95z,1564286546.0,"I grew up southern baptist. I‚Äôve known I was bisexual my whole life, and came out to close family at age 11. Parents were cool with it, grandparents were not. I still went to church with my grandma every Sunday because I saw nothing wrong with having faith and being LGBT, because my parents never made me feel weird or bad about it. 

One Sunday, the preacher starts talking about his daughter, who had recently come out to him as a lesbian. He told us how hard it was to love her now, how he struggled with knowing his daughter was engaging in such an awful sin and would go to hell when he just wanted her to be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so he could love her like he did before. He launches into a very homophobic sermon about how his daughter and her girlfriend would burn in hell. I was appalled. I had never heard anyone talk about gay people like that before.

So I walked out. I called my mom, she picked me up, and I never went back to church. As I grew older I stopped believing in god, but I lost my faith in him that day for sure because I found out how his followers would treat me and it just wasn‚Äôt worth it."

I was on a school trip to Hershey, Pennsylvania. I had eaten a hot dog and 2 slices of pepperoni pizza that day. I was hanging out in my friends hotel room and suddenly start getting stomach pains from hell. I played it off, said I was going to head back to my own room and get some rest. I‚Äôm about halfway down the hallway and suddenly the pain turns into movement and I can literally feel liquid shit rushing through my system at fucking light speed, as well as vomit starting to come up at a similar pace. I break into a sprint and just before entering the room I drop the room key. I bend over to pick it up, desperately trying to hold everything in and as soon as I insert the card I shit myself. In the hallway, probably 5 feet from the bathroom. I then proceeded to vomit, throw away my clothes, and break out into hives all over my body. Luckily my mom had chaperoned the trip, otherwise they would have had to take me to the ER."
