depressed,fo1redv,t3_g57f7n,1587439737.0,"I’ve come to learn that people who have not experienced true depression don’t get it and that’s ok. There will be people that get it and make you feel understood. Parents can be weird and not very supportive when we need them (at least not in my experience) my mom and I are super close now though, so there’s a chance she will get it more some day and be a bit more supportive. Hugs 🖤"

TrueOffMyChest,fn9ba67,t3_g0dyhq,1586766238.0,"Just keep checking in, even if you feel like it doesn’t help, it does !"
TrueOffMyChest,fn9appj,t3_g0amae,1586765603.0,"I felt this same way tonight and literally thought, I wonder if anyone else doesn’t kill themselves because of their dog and or upsetting other people (like for me it would be my mom) 

I also find the idea of actually “doing” something to end my life makes it harder as well. That’s also such a burden on so many people. My dog, my family, my friends, the people that would have to find me, clean up after it, the people’s house I live in. Ect ect 

For the most part I feel like my depression/issues stems from abandonment issues and feeling like no one loves me or cares, so kind of comical that when it comes down to it I don’t think I could do it because I don’t want to make a few people sad or be a burden to anyone. 

Hugs 🖤"

BPD,fn8ydhe,t3_framg2,1586753661.0,I do it a LOT. I always end up reactivating it and responding to people way quicker than I want to.
