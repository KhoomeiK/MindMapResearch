AskPsychiatry,f9xcezm,t3_e7bda8,1575708834.0,Yes of course. I only paid 30 pesos (half a dollar) for consultation.
depression,f7s018l,t3_dxlcmb,1573989340.0,I need the money for medication and rent. I’m all by myself.
depression,f7n9214,t3_dx2la6,1573890046.0,"Me too. I can’t focus even on very simple task. For example, I opened a box of toothpaste and I forgot where I placed it only to find out that I threw it out in the trash along with the toothpaste. My decision-making has significantly declined. I would buy too much food that I can’t finish all of them so I would have to throw it out and leave it to waste. Depression sucks."
