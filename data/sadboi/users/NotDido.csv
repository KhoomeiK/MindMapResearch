But the first thing I told my Betterhelp match in chat was I minimize things, I know what helps me is being asked questions like these, I need help but I am very very bad at asking for it. 

Even the university counselor at our last session said it was hard to go deeper with me because of it. She agreed when I said I had been ready when we started for like, help on alleviating the symptoms of anxiety and like treating mood swings like weather and that sort of thing, but not really ready to work on preventing that stuff or finding out why that happened to me, etc. She couldn‚Äôt even diagnose me as BPD in the months we talked, I‚Äôm just like,,,, pretty sure ?"

BPD,fqlu5dy,t1_fqlsia7,1589466122.0,"Yeah I deal with that too but tbh I‚Äôm learning that for me personally some of the love and affection a dm attention I give out is like an anxious thing for me. Like I‚Äôll make breakfast extra cute and come up with a new sweet thing to say and this and that partly because I want her to feel like ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ but also partly because I‚Äôm like oh god am I not doing enough? does she know i love her if i haven‚Äôt said it in a Whole Day?? (that‚Äôs an exaggeration but like you know what I mean) and then Ill get sad that she‚Äôs not doing the same and it‚Äôs like... actually I should be happy that she feels secure enough that like she can have a bad week stressing over a big work deadline and not have to feel like she has to also be Super Duper Sweet and reassuring to me during that week, if that makes sense? We can just be comfortably together without having to Prove our love all the time. I‚Äôm getting better at not taking an absence of a compliment or sweet thing as a bad thing. 

But she also has BPD so when I‚Äôm feeling really low (particularly on my period or if I just messed something up at work or something) and I‚Äôm like hi i feel crappy :( she‚Äôs so good at squeezing me tight and reassuring me and telling me all the things I know are true but sometimes just need to hear again just to make sure because my brains an asshole to me. Then she reassures me on top of that that it‚Äôs totally cool to ask for affection and that i‚Äôm not being needy. 

She‚Äôs taught me so much about communication. For so long I‚Äôve been afraid to tell partners what‚Äôs on my mind because it never comes out right and i think i‚Äôll sound needy or crazy. And I‚Äôve had a lot of negative reinforcement in the past where i‚Äôm too much for people and they get exasperated. But with her I can just be honest. And i know she‚Äôll be honest with me. 

Still a long road for me to feel secure all the time but it‚Äôs light years better than my past"

nyu,fq6kx89,t3_ggctzq,1589133504.0,">it seems like most of this is dictated by your status on social media.

I think that's just a thing before you actually get to classes/campus and meet everyone. Right now, the only thing people have to go off of is each other's social media profiles, so yeah the most interesting looking people on social media kind of get a lot of recognition. I remember a bunch of names from my year (Class of 2020!) who I've literally never seen again but just happened to be really engaged in the FB group before we got to campus. I swear to you that you can totally skip over this whole online saying hello thing and not seek anyone out till your first day on campus or in class and still be totally cool!

Also, as others have mentioned, social media is useful just to keep up with people, so if you want to make some profiles to try them out, go for it! No one will care if you don't have other followers/friends if it's a new profile. A lot of people make new profiles right before freshman year for a bunch of reasons, all of them totally normal and not weird. You're not a small fry! It may take you a sec to catch on to how people use different platforms, but it's really no biggie."

There's also one class that's about computer linguistics that's supposed to be very accessible. When I took it, it was a different prof teaching it, and honestly kind of boring it was so easy? We never touched any actual code. But with a different prof, it could be way more up your alley (see if you can get a syllabus) - Patterns in Language.

I'm very much not a mathy person - I was more interested in the socio, phono and child language acquisition classes, but from my best understanding, go for those.

It‚Äôs the same as a cis man and cis woman. If a cis lesbian dates a trans man, it would be kind of weird if she still called herself a lesbian, imo. There would certainly be people made uncomfortable by it, although honestly ultimately it‚Äôs between the people in that couple and what they‚Äôre comfortable with.

Michelle Tea, a cis queer woman who considered herself a lesbian for a long time and settled down with a man who is transgender, has written about this and how she learned how painful it was to trans people for her to say she‚Äôs dating a man, but he‚Äôs a trans man. Being a lesbian was a big identity for her, and her past trauma with cisgender men made it very strange for her to be in a relationship with a man and not want to be like ‚Äúoh but he‚Äôs trans!‚Äù But over time she made peace with the fact that sexuality is fluid and she didn‚Äôt have to undermine her partner‚Äôs gender to still be queer (for example, if someone is bi and dating someone of the opposite gender, they‚Äôre still bi and therefore still queer). 

Also as other people have mentioned, sometimes people transition while they‚Äôre one half of a couple. There‚Äôs whole workbooks and support groups for that. Sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. 

Does that make sense? Coming from a cis bisexual girl (actually possibly nonbinary I gotta figure that out lol) dating a trans lesbian girl"

AmItheAsshole,fog9kuf,t3_g74ma5,1587749723.0,"YTA. It doesn't sound like she wants ""anything to do with"" you either, she just wants her child to receive proper care. It's your medical history and if you feel uncomfortable, it's your right to keep it to yourself. Medical histories are very private. However, from what you've written, it seems like you have no reason to believe this woman wants to use any of your history against you, she's just caring for a sick child and your records could help that treatment.

If you're angry that she didn't tell you your dad died, that's honestly probably more on your dad than her. If he had made it clear he didn't want to contact you during his life, she probably figured it wouldn't be her place to randomly let you know about his death."
AmItheAsshole,fog8j5d,t3_g72ody,1587749321.0,"NTA. You can understand why she's doing something so messed up (her history) with complete conviction that she's doing the most loving thing possible, and also be extremely angry at her for doing this to your daughter. As a frequenter of r/EDAnonymous, I'm telling you you're exactly right that this can scar a kid for a long time."
AmItheAsshole,fog7q1y,t1_fofnpxk,1587749006.0,"Honestly, I'm shocked that so many comments aren't this. Absolutely agree with you."
AmItheAsshole,fog7j0u,t3_g77rzf,1587748933.0,"YTA ... Why does no one here, including you, believe his pain? As someone with a chronic illness, you should know how messed up it is when people straight up don't believe you. If you had come downstairs and he wasn't injured, but whatever happened was painful enough to warrant a scream (like idk, falling down stairs and landing on your back wrong or something), would you have been such a jerk about it? If no, then I think you need to accept that your husband has a low pain tolerance... and is genuinely feeling the pain he claims to... and stop being an asshole.

I doubt he's looking for attention, because it sounds like his spouse is a jerk whenever he gets hurt. I know I wouldn't want to deal with this level of condescension every time I'm in pain, especially if I've been supporting that person through an illness. Grow some basic human decency."

NoStupidQuestions,foaayvv,t3_g6hpo0,1587643448.0,"It‚Äôs just easy to say because I don‚Äôt have to think of the age. Like I remember something that happened in my 4th grade class, I know I was in 4th grade which I think was 11 or 12? Idk why it would be a uk/us difference honestly, but it just seems more distinct."
NoStupidQuestions,foaaclg,t3_g6l2d8,1587643090.0,It‚Äôs fine as long as there‚Äôs no unbalance power dynamic (and I doubt there would be w just two years difference) but you seem really defensive about it? Are there other reasons you‚Äôre worried?

AskReddit,fo7c8mh,t1_fo5obcq,1587575869.0,"Usually I don't like movies that make no sense with lots of boring fighting. But this one made no sense with some boring fighting and a lot of random, somewhat interesting characters (interesting for the thirty seconds of focus each one gets) and a cool style/color palette. Watched it at midnight with a friend in a pretty empty theater and loved it. Loved the sequel. No plot hole could ruin it for me lol"
