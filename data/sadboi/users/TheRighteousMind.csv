>Depressed and manic patients in the acute phase of their illness produce more errors of attention compared with matched controls, and performance deficits worsen with severity of illness.

> Patients with mood disorders can experience measurable deficits of attention during euthymic and disturbed mood states. Because attention and working memory are cognitive functions that are integral to many types of neuropsychological tests, the interpretation of studies showing deficits in a broad range of cognitive abilities should take into account the role of poor attentional/working memory capacity in these patients.

Edit: [Euthymic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthymia_(medicine)) = normal, tranquil mental state or mood. It is often used to describe a stable mental state or mood in those affected with bipolar disorder that is neither manic nor depressive, yet is distinguishable from healthy controls"
