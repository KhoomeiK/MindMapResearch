At least here in Rio everything's alright (for now). We are indoors for the most part, we arent prohibited to go outside, but its recommended to not do so.
About the VR, i bought the Samsung odyssey +, it was 2890 reais (around 540 US dollars), wich is 300 dollars more expensive then in the US (from what i searched). Even tho its that expansive, people dont hesitate buying things like consoles or gpu's here in Brazil just because of the price hehe.
Thank you for being worried! How about in your city?"

Isnt There a friend/ person you know that you can ask tô lend you the vr or make a deal with him/her só you can get the vr for a few days?
Isnt There *Any* way that you can get a vr, even If its a cheap one

If the answer is no for th three questions, i think maybe you should consider wait a bit to play half life alyx without the vr (Theres a mod for that). It wont be the same, but at least It Will be you playing
But If u think thats not a good option, well, in my opinion, yes maybe you should Watch a playthrough, but only If u cant play in the Next year. (Try looking for one that IS immersive and Fun tô watch for u)

Good news is, apparently, a specific half life game that *could* be released soon wont be vr only.

depression,f5jvm43,t3_do4dl5,1572242936.0,"Again, i cant say too much about your situation due to the fact that im not on your shoes, but is there any other family member around you that could help you (both emotionally and with your parents situation)? I think you should try seeking a therapist and focusing on yourself, although you are their son (or daughter), you have to put yourself first in these kind of situations, they are taking care of what they need to take care between them, but you cant let yourself fall into sadness or anything like that, it might be harder in the future,  (agian, i know its scary but its true). So, back to the point, try finding someone to talk to, it usually helps a lot you put your thoughts side by side and take control of them. Take care of your own mental state, give all of the love in the world to your family members right now (they are suffering just like you) and stick to your closest friends, they are like brothers but from another family. If your doctor tell you to take antiderpessants or anything like that, \*read a lot about those\* before taking them, its important that you know what youre putting inside your body, it depends a lot on the person how it will react, so again, take all of the information you need before taking them. In general, things will eventually be alright, and you will get out of this situation with a different vision of the world. in a good way. Everytime we go through stress or bad momments we end up being able to extract something good from it, and you might learn a lot from that. I know it might sound strange saying it, but its true, but remember, youre the one who needs to extract those things."
depression,f5jux66,t3_do4dl5,1572242019.0,"Alright bro, two things first of all: your writing is excelent, specially for your age (you should be really proud of that, i couldnt contain myself on saying this), second, ive been through similar things and i know how you feel rn.

Im 16, my parents got divorced when i was 7, the thing is that, when you are a kid, you dont actually digest everything that is going on around you, simply because of the fact that you dont really understand everything (at least not as much as a teenage). When we are at this age, our emotional state is really sensitive due to many hormone processes and etc (im sure you already heard that before), so its normal that you feel confused, but not only because of that. Seeing your parents arguing for a long time is horrible anyway, so feeling confused is a reflex of all of what you have to process in your mind. I see you have a lot to put out, both by the side of your text and by the way you explained things.

Since im 8 i live in conflict. My mom has borderline and oftenly has depression and agressive peaks. She already that horrible things that no human being should do to another. I also have OCD and anxiety, wich makes everything harder than it already is. These last 2 years were horrible for me, i live alone with her now, he dont have that much money and she's gone through 2 really bad health states recently. She had cancer last year (cured) and this year, due to the treatment, she had 3 strokes in a road. Since i live alone with her, i was the one that had to help her when it happened, alone in the 1st hour or so.

Anyway, i just wanted to give you a small context about what im also going through, and i think that talking to people is a really good way to find both a solution and someone that care. I would recommend you to try talking to your closest friends about it, in person (idk if you have it, last year for example i was almost completely alone...at least it seemed so). And also, i would like to offer myself to talk to you. Sadly i cant give you a hug or anything, but i hope i can make you feel better anyway i can. Youre going through a tuff time and you need a lot of support (we all do).

The last thing im gonna say to you is that it will all go away, it always does. Keep in mind that in the future you will have a bunch of opportunities to change everything, and, although it will seem scary to grow up, you will eventually see that is one of the best things that can happen to you.

Try having a calm and normal talk with your parents, you seem really mature so i suppose you can handle this. Idk exactly how your situation is, so im taking in consideration that it is possible. If you can, PM me or something so we can exchange some thoughts etc.

Take care bro, much love <3 (sorry if i wrote something nonsense, its 3 o clock here hehe)"
