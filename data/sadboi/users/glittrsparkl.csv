One of those people has an elderly grandmother he lives with and he's terrified of bringing the virus home and infecting her because of her high risk profile. I work for a small business, I've owned a small business, my family members own small businesses. Just because you don't agree with my stance doesn't mean I have sheltered eyes and don't understand how the world functions. I do understand, and what I understand is that capitalism in America isn't capitalism, it is now, and has always been big corporations getting propped up by the federal government and small businesses always taking the brunt of anything wrong. Maybe the businesses should provide the motivation to actually work instead of it being more beneficial to stay home safe. Capitalism in America helps some people, a very small, select group of people. Capitalism the way American runs it doesn't help the wider population, it expands wealth gaps and keeps people in poverty cycles.

And your number of deaths is 50k a year, we're at almost 80k deaths from Covid-19 before the end of May, that's not even half the year and 30k more deaths. 

Covid-19 is contagious, I survived my infection and am still unsure of where I caught it. People don't always know when they're infectious. It was the worst sickness I've ever dealt with and I had a moderate case that didn't require hospitalization. We don't know about the long term ramifications of the disease, we don't know a whole lot of anything, it's too new and scientists haven't had the time to study it completely.

AskReddit,fc0bwyr,t1_fc09xqw,1577286334.0,"Also, regarding pricing of products in stores, often the vendors are setting their prices. You would 'rent' out a set amount of your store's space to each vendor, your company's corporate would talk to their corporate and agree on certain pricing and promotions. Mom and Pop shops, which in this case are unfranchised, usually don't get their products from wholesale vendors but they buy from bulk vendors like Sam's Club, Costco, GFS, which means their cost is increased and their prices are higher and that it's harder for them to compete with corporate stores so most Mom and Pop shops are located in areas without other competition or they're out of business."
AskReddit,fc0axt4,t1_fc09xqw,1577285414.0,"If it's a corporate store the tags are printed off site the vast majority of the time. If it's a mom and pop shop they write their own, but most mom and pop shops are franchised corporate stores, so they'll have preprinted labels also. I've managed multiple stores for a large chunk of my life, very very rarely did we do anything other than tag each item and god help you if the tag on the item was a different price than the tag on the shelf, Karen will be all up in your shit demanding it for free. The retailers do determine the price, for their stores. Your tobacco store is owned by a different corporation than your liquor store, and tobacco/liquor stores have a whole separate set of tax requirements that they fall under, which can leak over into other retailers depending on how much of those two specific products they sell. Restaurants list the prices before tax because they hope people can't do their math correctly and tip off the post tax amount and not the base amount, which gets into tip culture in America and how it's stupid but tipped employees by and large don't want it to go away because they can make more money from tips than they can off hourly."

AskReddit,fc08u1p,t1_fc07stx,1577283300.0,"Well, because for my particular example there are 5,000 locations and the stickers on the shelf are again, provided by the corporation or the vendor, like Pepsi or a candy company like Mars, Inc. Each of those 5,000 locations can have different tax percentages charged and Pepsi and Mars, Inc supply products to more than just those 5,000 stores which means an even larger increase on tax variations. So the reason that the rest of the countries you're talking about can easily manage it is that the whole country has one set tax and so everything made for that country can all be the same. If EU tax areas were like they were in the US and there was no legal reason for EU companies to have tax included on your price tags they would also do it the way US corporations do because it's the most economical way to print signage. Signage isn't just advertisements btw, it includes the little tags listed on the shelves underneath products, so again, you're avoiding my point because you think I'm only talking about advertisements when I have always been talking about both those AND the stickers on the shelves you are so insistent about. So no, not simple problem solved."

But thank you for missing my point.
AskReddit,fc06f34,t1_fc0302k,1577280599.0,Because most signage on store shelves is shipped to the store preprinted or brought by suppliers preprinted. The stores rarely print their own price tags.
AskReddit,fc06bkw,t1_fc064us,1577280483.0,When TV commercials are running with pricing over a large geographical area and you have 15 different tax zones it’s hard to advertise the variety of prices. Same with in store signage. The signs are printed in bulk by the corporation and shipped to each store so you get a one size fits all sort of thing because shop A is a five minute drive from shop B but they have different tax rates.
conspiracy,fblcsoq,t1_fblandk,1576961158.0,Hanging off something higher actually increases the survival likelihood. Your body weight just dangling off a top rack while you thrash and struggle will end up breaking most things you hang off of. Tying something to a doorknob or bedpost and leaning forward basically means you’re putting yourself in a sleeper hold. The pressure from your weight leaning forward cuts off blood supply to the brain and you quickly get to the point where your body is incapable of leaning backwards to get the oxygen to survive. It’s why autoerotic asphyxiation can easily kill you on accident.

I never learned how to do cute hair styles because I always thought I should be embarrassed about how poofy, frizzy and full of dandruff it was.

I'm now in my 30s and finally went to see a hairstylist who has curly hair herself. She opened my eyes to how amazing my thick curly hair can actually be. One of the biggest things she told me to do was to just stop washing my hair at all. I could rinse it with water and finger brush it out, but no product, no shampoo, no brushing and only extra gentle wet combing of my hair for 3 weeks. And then after the three weeks of hair reset were up she told me to start trying the Curly Girl Method. 

It saved my life, no lie. I went from so depressed about my palm sized rats nests and flakey dandruff that I'd refuse to shower or take care of my hair to having beautiful, shiny, curly hair with NO dandruff.

Your daughter's hair is probably absolutely stunning under all the mistreatment she's been through. Her dandruff likely isn't because of her being dirty but because of her trying so desperately to make the dandruff go away and drying out her scalp."

sex,erqz0p4,t3_c3dqai,1561155717.0,"I'm in love with a man who has a pretty severe skin condition that has caused a lot of scarring. He's very self conscious of it and it makes him feel very insecure. Like you he doesn't ever want to be naked and I understand that and don't think it's ridiculous for him or silly of him to want his clothing on to give him some confidence. I love the man so if wearing clothing at all times is what is going to make him feel confident and secure then I want him to wear his clothes. His skin is a part of who he is, but it's not all of who he is. I don't love him because of his scars, or in spite of his scars, I just love him, all of him. Your boyfriend sounds the same. He sounds like a kind man who is willing to be patient and wait for you to be as comfortable as possible. 

I think maybe step one is for you to convince yourself that it's ok and understandable for you to have this insecurity. It's not ridiculous even if it happened to you when you were younger. Everything is so fragile as a teenager and it's easy to be deeply hurt. And sure, your personal situation is unconventional but there are so many people in the world dealing with insecurities caused by other people being cruel to them. You're not strange or abnormal, you're human and not alone. Which means a therapist is going to know ways to help you walk through this to get to the point you want to be at. I saw in other comments that you're afraid you can't afford a therapist and that's  unfortunate. Perhaps there are places or people you could talk to for a lower cost.

Another option maybe would be lingerie. There's so many styles of it for so many different body types. Then it's not a baggy t-shirt with cutouts you're wearing, it's a piece of clothing you specifically choose that could cover what you want to be covered while also being super sexy and fun."
