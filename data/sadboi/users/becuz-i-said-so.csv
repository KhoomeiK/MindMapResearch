My daughter started doing musical theatre at seven. I had someone she was doing theatre with help her with singing, because she was super loud, but a bit out of tune. Or I thought so. She actually was in tune, but so loud it sounded off to me. Like the only kid you can hear in an ensemble of 60 kids. 

Eight years later she has performed in two operas in a major city, competed in state chorale and solo competitions, and is on her fourth voice teacher. The reason she sings so loud is because she is likely going to be a dramatic soprano. Without voice lessons I believe her big voice would have been pushed out of a lot of groups and she would not still be singing today.

She has a lot of friends with natural musicality, which it sounds like your daughter might have. Some of her friends have musical parents, others don’t. My daughter started guitar at five and plays other instruments.  

The music stuff really helps with math later in life, so getting her in lessons now is a win/win. Just make sure she is having fun and the teacher has experience with young kids.

Kids are a different, and you might want to weigh the benefits of marriage again then, but I think it can go either way again, it depends on the situation. I only said something because you mentioned buying a house together, and I am surprised how many people don’t have protections in place."
relationships,f92g17v,t1_f92dwav,1575029412.0,"Honestly there are legal things that marriage offers. If you can afford that house alone or he has you as a beneficiary on his life insurance or will, then it isn't a big deal. It is hard to think about something happening to someone so young. My coworker lost her partner of years recently very suddenly. I wasn't really surprised to see how quickly his family pounced on things. Now they have his life insurance money, and she spent a big chunk of her savings on things like the funeral lunch and has a house she can't afford alone."

He was burned bad by a girl he committed to pretty young. I look back now and realize thecreason he waited to commit to this one wasn't because he wasn't into this girl, he really was screwed up by the first girl. It really is more about timing for lots of guys."

Interstitialcystitis,f6s32ae,t1_f6ro909,1573125828.0,It is easy to forget that when you are having a flare.

And someday they will be teenagers and you will miss them calling you anything, unless they want money or a ride somewhere."
