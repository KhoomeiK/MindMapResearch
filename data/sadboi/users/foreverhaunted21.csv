actuallesbians,fobhh66,t3_g6m4c5,1587659842.0,"This honestly fucks with me so hard. I'm bi, and I prefer women in general. But it's sometimes hard for me to see my relationships with women as long term because it's drilled into our heads as women that the long term goal is marriage with a man.

I once had a relative tell me that I could see women ""for fun"" but that I needed to get that out of my system early so I could get married and have babies. Yuck.

It's hard to overcome this though. Even when my relationships with women are so much better than my relationships with men, there's always that tiny part of me that can't help but feel like it's fleeting. As if I'm just killing time until I find that ""Mr. Right"", even though I don't want to. I feel like I have to, if that makes sense?"

I told her she's attractive but she's too young and her personality and beliefs kill it for me. She was so offended. Bitch, you made no big deal over grab her by the pussy comments because ""that's just how guys talk"", you don't understand how lesbians have sex because it doesn't count without a penis, you think trans people should be charged with genital mutilation, and if women kept their legs closed they wouldn't have to have abortions.

When the #MeToo movement happened and people shared stories it really made me just sit back and think about all the incidents that happened to me; it happened to me more often than I thought it did.

A coworkers ex girlfriend started seeing a guy she'd been talking to while they were dating. He wasn't fully the cause of the breakup but he was a big part of it.
