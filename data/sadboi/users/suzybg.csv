adultsurvivors,flik31z,t1_fli9c1o,1585184217.0,"I hate to (but am compelled to) say, for many or most, it definitely gets harder or more confusing or scarier or “darker?” before it: gets easier or better/starts to clear up/makes any real sense/isn’t completely confusing and-or terrifying. I feel like it’s probably just the nature of it. I also VERY much feel that you deciding to and actually posting this is a major step, if not one of the *most* important steps when it comes to healing. It’s all hard. Every word, decision, feeling...ALL OF
IT lol but realizing that there’s SOME PART of you that needs to be addressed, is absolutely courageous-to say the least. I don’t think it’s common, either, likely pretty rare. And really really commendable to take that first step. 
Just how I see it :) I hope you take my perspective for what it’s worth...I truly believe you’ve got WAY more potential and worth than you have ever thought you had. Really hope you hang in & find a way to see it :)"
