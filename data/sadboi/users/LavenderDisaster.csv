Other Trek stars I've met have been amazingly nice.  Rene Auberjonois (""Odo""), who sadly passed away a few months ago, was easily the nicest famous person I've ever met, and rarely missed out on going to a convention to say hello to him.

I've also met Duran Duran (yep I'm an old nerd), and while Simon le Bon and John Taylor were very nice, Nick Rhodes couldn't even pretend to be interested in meeting a huge fan.  Meh. 

I met Amanda Palmer a few years ago, and she was like meeting an old friend you haven't seen in years but it feels like no time has passed. So super sweet and funny and a great hugger.
