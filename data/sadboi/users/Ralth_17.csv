But then this whole covid-19 thing happened and I haven't talked to another human in person in like  a month and a half and I've been feeling completely sick with anxiety for the last week even with meditating every day. I don't know if I can take much more. Can't sleep a lot of nights which makes it so much worse."

Anxiety,fonw7y6,t3_g8ho2y,1587927687.0,"I can sympathize. For the last week or so, I have been feeling sick from anxiety. One night I started feeling anxious before bedtime, then couldn't sleep at all. Next day was rough, sweaty, feeling sick, fearful, panicky. Got a little bit of sleep that night, next day was still bad but easier, next day even better, then today is horrible again.

My only advice is try to reduce all forms of stress. Eat better, get a reasonable amount of exercise, but don't overdo it. Take sleep seriously. Sometimes meditation can help if you are in a state of mind where that is possible. The understanding that your feelings at that moment are not all that you are, and objective observation makes it easier to endure. Also helps to avoid getting stuck in a loop that results in a panic attack or breakdown making things worse.

Anxiety,fontr1h,t1_fonmrzs,1587926294.0,I take L-theanine sometimes when I have caffeine because it cuts out some of the anxiety effects and helps concentration. Lately I just avoid caffeine mostly though. Sometimes a long bout of light exercise can help when I overdo caffiene.
Anxiety,fonsvds,t3_g8c5hq,1587925803.0,"Well, stress hormones like cortisol typically surge in the morning starting at like 4 am and peaking at 9am ish, so if your body is really stressed, you typically feel the worst in the morning. Those medicines can do weird things to you. 

I get like this a lot lately. Wake up at like 4am feeling sick and shaky and anxious and fearful.

Best thing for me is to try to reduce all forms of stress. Getting more exercise, better eating, meditation, trying to get some social interaction (this is really rough for me right now), etc.

Today I didn't wake up quite like that, but started to feel super anxious and sick after working out. Maybe I over did it. Now I'm so miserable. Its such a painful processes. Knowing I probably won't be able to sleep at all tonight. Ok I'm rambling, sorry."

Only things that have helped me is to do so meditation before hand and spend some time thinking about what makes me so anxious, how I can be OK with that and find a way to do it anyways. Making very small manageable goals like 15 minutes and a break to start, and accept that it will feel uncomfortable and you will have intrusive thoughts while it is happening and that is OK. Try to find something other than the class/deadline to help motivate you, like sometimes I try to exercise my mindfulness techniques while I study and go all out and try to find some interesting things in what I'm learning. When things are really bad, sometimes it helps me to think well what if I fail, what is the worst that can happen, then try to find a way to understand that is not the end of the world and this helps take a little pressure off."

hearthstone,f7kn7gf,t1_f7kmffz,1573819057.0,"This reasoning is off for a few reasons. First we should be very specific about what event we are trying to calculate the likelihood of. Based on your table title it should be ""the probability that at least one alley cat shows up in the tavern"". The easiest way to calculate this would be 1-P(no alley cats).

2nd,  while it is true that the probability of getting an alley cat if there were just 1 minion slot in the tavern is 1/12, this changes when we add slots since we have extra possibilities for what the other slots can be. For instance once we have chosen the minion for the first slot there are only 215 remaining minions to select from for the 2nd slot and so on."

&#x200B;

For example, it definitely isn't even 25% to get a specific tier 1 at tavern level 1. A way to see they can't be correct is your ""check"" that  (10.83%\*(amount of units from level1) + 9.03%\*(amount of units from level2) + 7.82%\*(amount of units from level3) + 6.62%\*(amount of units from level4) )/(amount of unit choices for level 4) = 100%)  should add up to more than 100% since these are NOT disjoint events. On tavern tier 4, for example, it can happen that we get both a tier 1 and a tier 3 unit."

The anxiety is just too f'ing scary. It was mind bending and I still feel scarred and broken from it after not having a drink in nearly a year.

I've read that after alcohol leaves your system, your cortisol levels can spike pretty high which can cause anxiety. Alcohol is really a shitty drug man."

Anxiety,f1uz0zs,t3_datl1i,1569765232.0,"I have had similar problems. It eventually morphed into having full fledged panic attacks after drinking. The last time I had a few drink in December of last year, I was in a perpetual state of panic for like almost 2 weeks. Ended up in the Urgent Care and ER, but there wasn't much they could do. Couldn't eat at all. I haven't had any alcohol since then, but I feel like that episode broke me  a bit.

When I am stressed I now get the same feelings back, usually worst in the mornings and gets gradually better towards evening, which leads me to believe its linked to high stress hormones such as cortisol in my body since they are highest just after waking up. I tend to feel like I have more energy the days after too, though my anxiety is still a bit high.

My advice, if you are having issues like this, try to eliminate alcohol, it might get way worse as mine did and it definitely is not worth it. Some tips I've developed for getting through it:

\- Practice some deep breathing in bed, maybe listen to a guided meditation.

\- Try to get up. Keeping busy can help you get through the day and distract yourself from the anxiety.

\-  Remind yourself that it will pass and that you can bear the anxiety and still get through doing things.

\- If your mind calms down a bit, try meditating and exercise. They can help in the long run.

\- Practice deep breathing techniques throughout the day.

\- Eating a little bit throughout the day seems to help even if you don't feel like it. I do shakes and stuff"
