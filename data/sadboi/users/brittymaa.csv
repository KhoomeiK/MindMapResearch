I think it’s pretty common to maybe be in shock. Not everyone cries because they received bad news and that doesn’t mean anything really other than you’re not a crier.

Epilepsy,fnqh97m,t1_fnqda4a,1587164570.0,My neuro said that some people have higher or lower seizure thresholds than others and that just because it appears like a seizure on the eeg doesn’t mean I necessarily am having one. He also put emphasis on the word “trait”

I’m just worried about my brain and I’ve never been told I have epilepsy before but I did just check the report for the old eeg and it does say the same thing. I’m kind of mad that my neuro didn’t say this the last time and just said the last one was “abnormal” and had “spikes and jumps”"

bipolar,f9uqjt6,t1_f9uonma,1575655897.0,His reason for not wanting me to change jobs is because I have a history of changing jobs very quickly.

I left my last job to come where I’m working now because I was essentially being bullied everyday.

Where I am now the people I work with are pretty great, for the most part I like them. But it causes me a lot of anxiety because I have a ton of clients I need to see and I feel like I’m always forgetting something.

I am a registered nurse so I was able to care for my mom as I would any other patient I’ve had but I will tell you that it’s crazy hard when it’s your own mom/dad/etc. I’ve heard from many people that usually death while on home hospice is preferred and I can only speak for myself and my experience, but I have to agree with them. My mom had told me before things got bad that she wanted to die at home in her bed with her dog next to her and that’s exactly what she got.
