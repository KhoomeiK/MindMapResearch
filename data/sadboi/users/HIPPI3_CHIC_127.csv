astrologyreadings,flziafw,t1_flzh7pa,1585624339.0,"We met 7 years ago. It was like time stopped when we saw each other. It was like the stars aligned and in that moment his soul spoke to mine. It's so hard to explain. I'm not a person who relies on physical appearance for a connection. (I hope that makes sense) I worked in retail so he would find ways or go out of his way to come in and see me. We both felt it but neither of us said anything. I assumed I was just.....I don't know....imagining it? So I started dating another guy and months passed and he was with another girl. Then a few months go by and she was pregnant then they got married. 7 years later, we recently came back into each others lives. Friendship only but we ended up telling each other how we felt then. Everything about him speaks to my soul. It seems like his soul and mine were made for each other. I finally escaped that abusive relationship with the other man I started dating then. However, he is still married and I respect that enough to leave things alone. It just seems so right."
