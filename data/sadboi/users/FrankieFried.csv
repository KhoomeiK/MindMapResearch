DecidingToBeBetter,fpo1wpv,t3_ge9zuq,1588776888.0,"As someone working through a similar struggle, I admire your courage- it's so incredibly hard to stand up to those thoughts sometimes, and to be able to take back control and say ""no more!"" is a huge step. Learning to love yourself after years of feeling unworthy or inadequate and just unlovable is such a tough journey, and any steps you take along that are good ones. Congrats ❤️"
EatingDisorders,fpnp66x,t3_geh0u8,1588769430.0,"I remember using the bathroom in my new dentists' office for the first time and being so genuinely shocked- they had a mirror that showed my reflection in an unusual angle, and I couldn't believe it was me. This was after six months of progressive weight loss, and everyone around me would say how small I was, while I was convinced I was just as big/no different than before. After struggling with an ED/BD for years, it was the first time I could actually *see* what people were talking about. 

BD is one of the factors that can drive eating disorders, though they're usually a lot more complicated than just wanting to lose weight. Comparing yourself to other people will always, always be unhelpful- ESPECIALLY celebrities/influencers, who have the benefits of personal trainers/Photoshop/dietitians, etc. 

As far as not feeling like you're skinny enough to merit concern, it's important to realize that every body is different, and that a person's healthy weight can't always be measured by how you look. You don't need to have every bone visible before someone decides that you're at the point where you need help or actually have a problem. it's something that is affecting your life now, in a very real way, and you deserve all the support and care available."
EatingDisorders,fpmu4f2,t3_gdvflk,1588741784.0,"That's great that you're wanting to be a support for your friend! And as someone else commented below, that can look different for everyone- some people don't want to talk about it at all, some people prefer that it's out in the open and can finally have a conversation about it. I think the best thing to do is leave it in your friends' court: let her know that you're there for her and want to support her in her recovery. Depending on whether she wants to have that conversation, you can always ask what you can do to help support her: maybe going for a meal together, or being available if she wants to call you when she's feeling the need to binge/purge- whatever it looks like for her. Showing you're ready to listen to her and wanting to help will likely mean a lot, so even if she doesn't ask for any support in particular, she'll likely be grateful that you just asked."
EatingDisorders,fpmt7ot,t3_gd8rt6,1588741085.0,"Sorry to hear you're having a hard time- the world is a bit of a crazy place right now, and trying to navigate that along with an ED is especially challenging. I'm going through something similar at the moment, and can really relate. 

You're not alone- trying to quiet those racing thoughts is so incredibly difficult, and with the lockdown, a lot of the usual distractions aren't there. I know how exhausting it is to be constantly weighing, judging, calculating... Every moment somehow becomes about food, and it takes away so much of your enjoyment in the rest of your life. 

A big thing for me was trying to look at some of the underlying causes of my ED: it took me a long time to make the connection between my anxiety and my ED behaviours. But when I did, it became a lot easier to follow the progression of thoughts and to start catching myself before I got too wound up. 

Another thing I found helpful was practicing being kinder to myself, and trying to be more forgiving when I did have a treat or slipped up. One thing that's important to remember is that just like you won't lose weight by eating healthy and going to the gym for a day, you're not going to undo all the work you've put in by having a treat!

You got this- just take it slow and go easy on yourself: it's not a straight line to recovery, and there aren't easy answers. You can always send a PM if you feel the need to chat!"
EatingDisorders,fpmprav,t3_gco46r,1588738566.0,"First of all, you should be proud of yourself that you wrote this post. Acknowledging that you might have a problem can be frightening, especially when you already have ongoing mental health issues: I can completely understand where you're coming from when you talk about not wanting to add it to the list of things that you feel are wrong with you. 

But I want to tell you what the people who have been helping me say: you are worth it. You are not whining, you are not making a fuss, you are not pathetic for wanting to talk about it. Your feelings are completely valid, and there's no reason to feel silly for having them. 

Eating disorders love secrecy, and to make us feel isolated and alone. But you don't have to be- we're all here to support you as you go through this. You can do this ❤️"
