bipolar,fo6ujyn,t3_g5ummg,1587566996.0,You only need one manic episode to be diagnosed as bipolar. I have a similar story to yours and I didn't believe it and it just got worse and worse.

I'm not dating right now but in my friendships my friends know that I get distant and cold sometimes so they never internalize it. Sometimes it helps that the other person knows you're not being that way because of them it's just your own thing. 

They might've been scared that it started out well then seem to change for the worst. 

Also communicate what you need during those times. Like ""if I'm distant I need you to not push and just let me work through it"" or whatever. 

I wish you the best."

bipolar,fo38ye9,t3_g5cat1,1587482747.0,BP1. I miss my mania so much but I know it's bad for me. You can work through the zombie stage of medicine. Yes you will lose your good swings that's because the meds are there to mellow you out. Don't give up on the process. It will be a process getting back to where you're comfortable. I am still frustrated now because I wrote such beautiful songs while manic/hypomanic and it's nothing now but I know this is better for me. A new normal.

Then when I get up/ready that's when I take everything else going from most important to least important.
