The first time I had one was middle of the night (I also suffer from really bad and really chronic sleep paralysis) and I felt like I was dying, because of the sleep paralysis and the pain I tried my hardest to wake my partner up but I failed and just closed my eyes and kind of accepted I was going to die....

Sorry you’re suffering. Obviously I don’t know your age and they may have done this, but if it happens again you should demand they do an ECG to check your heart 💓 though, just in case.

I know we are complete strangers, but we're all here because we can relate and empathise with each other so we know that we have that in common. Hearing your words have reminded me that I am not in the wrong for feeling this way, and I definitely need to focus more on helping myself. This lockdown situation has affected me a lot and I've lost my usual routine, and stopped doing the self-care things I usually do so I am sure that has a lot to do with it. I will definitely try to get back to focusing on me for a while. Thank you so much 💖🦄"

lonely,fqmym0v,t1_fqmygn2,1589485706.0,Help with what?! I don’t understand.
Anxietyhelp,fqms2jr,t1_fqmqj2e,1589482584.0,"Yeah it’s confusing. Basically, when they are in need of support they come to me and I am always there for them. They always say “we’re always here for you” but....

I have a tendency to keep a lot of feelings to myself because I had a pretty messed up childhood and I don’t want to be a burden on people BUT that doesn’t mean I never want to talk about it.

As I said, I’m always there for them when they need support and sometimes I’ll message them
And they won’t reply for days or weeks and sometimes not at all and I accept this because I understand that when people are struggling sometimes messaging someone is too much. So I don’t push it and I’ll send a message a week or so later just to remind them I’m here - usually an emoji or a gif or a meme or something. They will happily ignore my messages and expect everything to be fine when they are struggling. Also they rarely even ask how I’m doing. Or they say “always here for you” but they don’t show it. For example, one of them messaged me the other day. I didn’t reply immediately and they got annoyed. I messaged the next day and apologised and said that I wasn’t doing well and they got annoyed because they apparently are doing well and want to catch up/hang out etc and I had to say that I wasn’t up to doing a big group chat but we could talk and then they stopped messaging me completely. And I heard They were annoyed. So instead of being a friend and understanding that I’m struggling and giving me some time or even saying “yes let’s chat just us” they ghosted me. Doesn’t exactly make me feel like they care and it definitely shows that they were annoyed and inconvenienced because the “awesome Kez” they know is struggling and apparently they expect me to always be the “awesome Kez” they know even though they are aware of my general situation. This is just one example. But it’s been like this for years and if I ever say they’ve upset me because they suddenly ghost me when I say I’m not doing well, they end up having a go at me for upsetting the friend who ghosted me because I told them how I felt. 

Hopefully that helps clarify the situation a bit more..."

This was my first time posting and I have learned that I really should have provided more information in my original post, and I should have tried to calm myself before replying rashly.

I honestly want to thank all of you who have commented for your support - even if I didn’t show it well at the time, I am truly so grateful that so many of you have taken the time out of your day to offer support to a stranger. Thank you so much to all of you and again, I apologise for the tone of some of my messages. I’m embarrassed and deeply ashamed of myself for that.

Anxietyhelp,fqmklpd,t1_fqmi3ml,1589478993.0,"Hi

Thank you for your reply. I understand what you are saying completely. In hindsight I should have not replied to the poster who upset me because of exactly what you said at the beginning of your comment and I am aware of that. In reality I should have been clearer with my original post but i couldn’t think clearly at the time because I was so overwhelmed. I have tried to clarify the situation since and it seems, from your reply, that that has helped as you have mentioned things I said in those recent comments.

I also think I should have made my diagnosis’ clearer but this was my first time posting on here and I was really struggling. I’ll take it as a learning experience. I didn’t mean to be aggressive. For me, I was desperately trying to make the situation clear because the assumptions made by some were wrong but even when I said that the assumptions were wrong the person refused to acknowledge it and the context makes a big difference. Again, all I can do is take it as a learning experience now.

Thank you for your advice and for seeing past my aggression. (I’m really not like that I feel so bad that I came across like that). But thank you. I am going to have a think about ways I can try communicating with them differently to see if that helps. My BPD makes relationships hard - I’m not blaming my BPD but it makes me so worried of people abandoning me (my mum raised me and committed suicide when I was 15 and that was followed by some bad stuff so..). I am going to brainstorm ideas and if things don’t change I am afraid you may be right. Truthfully I think I already think you’re right and that is what has me so upset - the realisation that maybe I need to move on from them when I really don’t want to.

Thank you again for your message, I will definitely consider what you have said moving forward. Thank you and I’m sorry for what you went through. That must have been horrible at the time, but if you’re doing better now and your happy that’s what counts. Thanks again 💖🦄"

Internationally. They have natural colours and fun colours and varying lengths. Their “hard front” wigs that come with a fringe are £45 and gorgeous, while the lace fronts are £70 I have a number of their wigs and they are the best quality I have found (and I have nearly 100wigs in total). They have short styles (primarily in their “hardfront” the “Taylor” style is a super cute bob-length but slightly wavy and they also have sort of, just below the shoulders styles too. The synthetics are so soft and they are very thick. I like a lot of hair (I recently bought one from there that had a warning label 😂😂 

[the one with the warning label](https://webster-wigs.myshopify.com/products/amelia-candy-crush?_pos=7&_sid=67938fc2c&_ss=r) 

They also have the Ashley and the Jenna in hardfront with fringes and they all come in natural colours and fun colours.

If you want to go for a lace front, I think the Scarlett would be a good fit for you, maybe the Lily but it’s on the longer side.

As I said the synthetics are so soft they feel almost like real hair and while they are thick they are not crazy thick but could also be easily thinned if you had a friend who can do that and if you feel it is a bit too dense.

I was mega surprised at the quality because they honestly are not what I would expect for under $100. 

My gawd, I sound like I work for them 😂😂😂 

Anyway I’ve included some links to some of the ones I’ve mentioned. (I have so many wigs and I shop around and this is the brand I think is the best fit for what you are looking for. If you go for the £45 you could get a natural one and a fun one 😂😂

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any questions or if these aren’t right I can continue looking!

Anxietyhelp,fqmdjcj,t1_fqlzfp3,1589475664.0,"There’s no doubt that a lot of what you have said here is true. My mum had so so many friends, so many people who loved her, 2 children who thought she was the best person in the world and she still decided to kill her self because she felt like she had no one and that we would all be better off without her. 

I guess the main issue for me here is I’m talking about a very specific issue and I’m now realising that I probably should have been more specific in my first post so there wouldn’t be room for misunderstandings that have clearly happened, but at the time I couldn’t think past writing the original post.

I don’t think anyone wants me to die. And the hard part is that I know that my friends care. They just don’t show it. When they are struggling with their mental health or other struggles they come to me. And that’s fine. I want to be there for them. I want to help them even if I’m just a soundboard for them. The problem is I don’t feel like I can ever do the same to them. They always talk about how much they love me and how “awesome” I am etc etc and they always say “we’re always here for you” but when they message and I reply with “I’m not doing well, I’m really struggling” - literally just that - they get annoyed because they’re mental health is doing better at the moment so they want to catch up and “hang out” with their “awesome friend”. That leads to me saying “sorry, we can do that when I’m feeling a bit better” and they don’t seem to accept that. When it’s them struggling, and I message to say “hi” or whatever, they will often not reply for...sometimes months...and I accept that because I know they are struggling themselves and they can’t face picking up the phone - I get like that too so I understand. And I’ll wait, I may send another message after a few days or a week or so just reminding them that I’m here, or an emoji or a gif or something but I accept that they’re struggling and not in a place to socialise. However, when the tables turn and I’m the one not replying - they act like I’m doing something wrong because “they want to talk now” and I’m not able to do that.

I was on anti depressants for a while but I came off them about a year ago. Don’t get me wrong, I usually have support through my community mental health team, but I moved fairly recently and then this happened which has made my wait for my referral much longer and harder to cope with.

I may also be wrong in not just straight out asking them if we can talk about what I’m going through, but when I have tried they tend to just suddenly stop replying to my messages, then I’ll get a message from them a few days or weeks later acting like nothing happened.

When I said “it doesn’t get better” I was referring to the fact that it doesn’t matter how many times I try and talk to them about it, it always ends up with them saying “we’re always always here for you” and then the exact same thing happens all over again.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do that I either haven’t already tried, or am already doing. That’s why I posted."
Anxietyhelp,fqmb65b,t1_fqlzftl,1589474550.0,You’re right. I’m just not good with being alone 😔. I will definitely take what you have said into account and try and see the best way of moving forward. Thank you 💖

Anxietyhelp,fqmaim0,t1_fqma292,1589474247.0,"Hey. Yeah, I never do talk to them about my problems. Never have done unless they offer and even then I usually just shrug it off and ask them about how they are."
Anxietyhelp,fqm9rmh,t1_fqm5itu,1589473894.0,"Hi. 

It’s not that I feel everyone is attacking me. A couple of people who have replied have made assumptions about the situation which aren’t accurate. I have tried to explain why their “support” isn’t relevant and they refuse to acknowledge that. 

It hurts because I am always there for these people but if I am ever not 100% they get annoyed. They say they are “here for me” but then they aren’t. 

I am truly heartbroken that one poster in particular made a comment that was not accurate; I explained why, and they ignored it. 

A lot of the people who have replied have shown what I consider “support”. If you are basing your comment on my replies to that poster then I can understand why you would comment this. Absolutely. And in truth, I should probably have ignored that poster but I wanted to show how they have misinterpreted my situation.

Also; I’m not angry. I’m hurt by that poster and I’m hurt at the idea that people would make callous assumptions instead of asking for more context if they wanted to be able to provide support but felt I hadn’t given enough information in my original post.

When you say “about the way your life is” I’m
Not sure what you mean? I haven’t really spoken about my life. I’ve only spoken about this specific issue. (This is a genuine question, not angry or anything)

Again, I’m not infuriated by everyone’s responses. Just 2 people’s responses because they have made assumptions and provided “support” instead of asking for clarity.

I have experienced a lot of trauma. I’m also BPD so maybe that might help you understand my feelings here. I am in a lot of pain and I have. A tendency to get very overwhelmed - should I have put that in my original post? I’ve only been on here for a couple of weeks and had never used reddit before so maybe I should have included these things in my post. I don’t know. But when I reply to people on here, if I’m not sure about the context or need some clarification, I ask for it.

In regards to your last question. I don’t think so. I do expect people offering support to someone struggling to consider how their message could be construed by the OP. But I don’t assume that because I am a certain way with my friends that they should automatically be the same with me. These are people who have said to me “I’m always here for you” - I rarely take people up on that because I don’t want to add to their struggles - especially because most of my friends suffer with mental health issues of their own. But when someone says “I’m always here for you” and then they message asking how I am and I say “I’m not doing too well at the moment” and they say “oh but I wanted to catch up because I’m doing better at the moment and don’t even offer a hand or an ear or anything it hurts. And when it starts happening constantly to the point where when they message me needing support and I’m always there, and they act like my mental well-being doesn’t matter it hurts to think that these people say they’re my best friends but don’t ever show it.

I know that most of the people on here are trying to help and pretty much everyone is helping, but there was one person who hurt me by making a wrong assumption that when I clarified decided to ignore it. - that’s what has hurt me the most. If you posted something and I replied making a load of assumptions about you and you were like “errr...that’s not right or appropriate for my current situation” and then you explained it and I just ignored you, wouldn’t that upset you a little bit?

I hope that helps clarify my position a bit for you.

I think, if you go to my profile you should be able to see my “backstory” if you want to understand me a bit better. Of course, I’m not expecting you to do that, I’m just saying that it is written out on there from when I was speaking to someone a week or so ago."
Anxietyhelp,fqm6xz3,t1_fqm4vpr,1589472547.0,Yes there is. You made assumptions about me and my situation that aren’t accurate. Therefore your “support” isn’t relevant to this problem. How can you not see that?!
Anxietyhelp,fqm6tfg,t1_fqm4tid,1589472485.0,But you have made assumptions about me and my situation that are wrong. And I have explained to you why they are wrong and you don’t even care.
Anxietyhelp,fqm6mny,t1_fqm64xa,1589472395.0,"Oh my god. I don’t expect anyone to be there for me 24/7 when did I ever say that?! Again you are making assumptions that are not accurate or valid. I am always there supporting my friends but when I don’t reply to a message immediately they get annoyed and if I say “sorry I’m not doing well” they get annoyed because they are feeling better in themselves and want to “catch-up” instead of offering to talk about it or anything. That is very different than the idea that I am constantly crying down the phone and putting everything on my friends when the truth of the matter is, they don’t have a clue what is going on with me because when I say I’m having a hard time, they just stop messaging"
Anxietyhelp,fqm4bq2,t1_fqm475p,1589471277.0,You have made assumptions about me and my situation that are wrong and you can’t even apologise. That’s messed up.
Anxietyhelp,fqm45wp,t1_fqm0g21,1589471196.0,"1. I never talk to them about my struggles. None of them. 

2. I have survived a suicide attempt

3. My mother committed suicide when I was a teenager

4. I can’t believe you have taken a short piece of writing and instead of asking for clarity, you have assumed that I am constantly complaining or crying down the phone to these people when the most I ever say is “I’m not doing well” if they ask them we sometimes talk about it but they usually don’t and instead they say “oh but my mental health is doing better at the moment and I wanted to catch up” acting as if their mental health is all that matters and mine is an inconvenience.

Thank you for making me feel worse about myself. That’s a really great thing to do to someone struggling with suicidal thoughts. I wish I’d never posted. I was under the impression this was a place for people to be supportive and help people. Not a place to berate people and basically tell them that they are in the wrong based on assumptions you have made that couldn’t be further from the truth. 

How did you think that reply would be received? Did you really think that would make me feel supported or “better” in any way?"
Anxietyhelp,fqm3cpb,t1_fqm0tn5,1589470797.0,"I thought this group was a supportive place. You have made me feel worse than I did before because all of your assumptions are wrong. If you needed more information in order to give advice then you could have asked for it. When people are really struggling and are considering ending their lives, I would think you would understand the situation well enough to know not to just go making assumptions that make that person feel worse. 

What you have said has really hurt me. I feel your messages were hostile and aggressive and I feel attacked by someone who doesn’t know me, and clearly couldn’t be bothered to get to know me before sending a suicidal person a message that is just going to make them feel worse about themselves.

When I said I should feel guilty for being depressed because it’s an inconvenience what I meant was I message my friends who also struggle with depression/mental health/addiction etc regularly just to check-in. Sometimes, in fact often, they don’t reply because “they are struggling” so I don’t take it personally and when they do reply I help them and remind them that I am always here for them. However, when they message me saying “Hi” if I don’t reply immediately - they get annoyed. If when I do reply I say “sorry I’m not doing well with my mental health at the moment” they say things like “but I’m doing better and I want to catch up with you” which makes me feel like they don’t actually care about me at all. I don’t push anything on to them. I don’t even tell them when I’m struggling because I know they are going through their own struggles, but for them to be so disinterested in caring about someone they call a “best friend” makes me feel like a piece of sh*t.

lonely,fqlub72,t1_fqls0tb,1589466208.0,"Not really. It’s not like something just happened. It’s a constant thing that my close friends always do. They come to me when they are struggling but as soon as I am struggling they just act like it’s not okay for me to be struggling and they never try and talk to me about it or anything. I’ve even had close friends say “we’re absolutely always here for you, as much as we can be” which basically completely negates the offer of being there for me because they’re immediately stating that maybe they can’t be there all the time. It’s also things like I will message them and they will take ages to reply or even not reply at all but when they message me and I don’t reply immediately they act like I’m doing something wrong - but it’s fine for them to do it. 

One rule for me and a different rule for everyone else.

They also talk to me like I am responsible for how I feel. They say things like “you are choosing to feel that way. You are choosing to have that disorder. You are choosing to cry” - and these are people who have mental health issues/addictions etc themselves.

Literally no one cares.

I’m pretty easy to understand because I am on social media a LOT. So when I suddenly stop posting it means I’m not doing well - and they know that. I also use a lot of emojis so when I message something really short and without emojis it’s a sign I’m not doing well - and they just don’t care. And then if I tell them that they have hurt my feelings everyone ends up having a go at me for upsetting the person who has hurt my feelings."

depression_help,fql9olf,t1_fqk17pv,1589451182.0,"I’m glad you and your friends managed to sort things out - just make sure you remain open and honest with them :)

With regards to the boy: I’m sure you know that sometimes people with depression can lose motivation to do anything (as you suffer from it yourself I know you will be aware of this) but sometimes, if someone we know suffers from the same thing as us we have a tendency to think (subconsciously) that they should deal with or face the problem the way we do and that’s not always the case (I hope that makes sense). 

You seem to care a lot and I would imagine that feeling kind of powerless to help him is difficult for you. Based on my experience, the best thing to do is distance yourself slightly and just sending a message every so often to remind them that you’re thinking about them and you care. You drawing back also means that it will give him some space and some silence for him to rest and hopefully find that motivation within himself.

I know it’s hard to do what I’ve said when you’re scared and worried for someone but I’ve found that generally, you can’t help someone until they want to help themselves AND you need to look after yourself too.

depression_help,fqitwpp,t3_giuoa6,1589400835.0,"I really don’t mean to be out of line here but reading some of these responses has really upset and angered me. 

People need to stop saying “oh it’s your age, everyone goes through that, you haven’t lost all your friends” etc etc because, to me at least, that is so invalidating of what you are going through and what you are experiencing. To say that “everyone goes through that and things will get better when you’re older” completely takes away from your JUSTIFIED feelings.

As I said, I’m really not trying to have a go at everyone but I’ve experienced and still do experience people treating me like shit and thinking it’s fine, but making me feel like crap if I say one thing they disagree with. I was hospitalised for suicidal depression: I lost my best friend; I was raped: I lost another close friend. Because some people are just nasty and cruel and you spend all your time feeling like shit and crying and wondering why you keep getting treated like this when all you do is make time for people and treat your friends as well as possible.

I don’t want to diagnose you, but is it possible you may have borderline personality disorder? You don’t have to answer that publicly. People with BPD are known for having really bad friends because our fear of abandonment means we want to be accepted so badly that we will go out of our way for people who we think of as “close friends” when they might just be using us and/or might actually be pretty toxic people.

Sorry for getting angry but I see so much of myself in what you wrote. I am 32 for reference. Maybe read up or watch some videos on YouTube about BPD. I actually have a video on my YouTube which is incredibly raw of the reaction I got when I told a “friend” that I had BPD and I also have my mental health story and some other things on there. They might show you that you’re not alone and they also might help you process everything and look forward. My YouTube is kezandunicorns and I am honestly just mentioning it because I think it genuinely might help. I also have a playlist of other creators’ videos I found useful - many of them on BPD 

You can also read my “story” on my reddit profile page (I think 🤔I’m new to Reddit”

If you want to talk then I’d love to talk with you and see if I can help in any way. You don’t deserve the way you are being treated. It is absolutely not okay - what “Katie” did. Getting advice from you and then doing that to you, and if you keep forgiving that behaviour because you want to be included, it will continue to happen and you owe yourself more than that. Please.

Again, sorry for getting so frustrated, I don’t mean disrespect against the people who have commented, I think I probably just have a different perspective on the situation. Not necessarily better or worse, just different.

mentalhealth,fpjn4b1,t1_fph7o45,1588674661.0,"*Potential TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ suicide; eating disorders, sexual assault, abuse, self harm*

Ooh that’s a lot to say there. I’ll do my best to answer these questions but I have a YouTube channel where I have some videos very much talking about my mental health history. I’m kezandunicorns on YouTube if you want to watch a video too/instead.

Basically BPD is a disorder that almost always happens due to trauma experienced in childhood. My dad left just after I was born and my mum was a psychiatric nurse who had severe depression (I had no idea until the first time she tried to kill herself when I was 12). She also had an alcohol dependency and anorexia. She tried to commit suicide three times, succeeding on the third attempt. This happened just after she had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for ECT and therapy. I was 15. I then had to move in with my uncle where there was some physical and a lot of emotional abuse. I wasn’t allowed to properly mourn her death and I was treated badly. Side note: I was also a hardcore gymnast and suffered a number of serious injuries, including continuing to train through a broken back. I tore my Achilles just before my mum died so I lost my family and my career at the same time. Due to the way I was lied to and treated by my family after my mum died (I was incredibly close to my mum) I’ve struggled with fear of abandonment and an inability to trust people.

I turned to schoolwork and activities and generally did my best to use being busy as a coping strategy. This worked fairly well until I had to stop working 4years ago. I had to stop working because my back didn’t heal correctly and I now suffer with incredibly acute and debilitating chronic pain in my back. After losing gymnastics I decided to pursue musical theatre and worked in that for a few years before an accident lead to me being unable to move. I was bedridden for about a year and doctors weren’t confident I would walk again. I can walk now but I’m heavily medicated and still in constant pain. I then went on to get a first class degree and pursue a masters before accepting a job offer in Spain. I came back to the UK after 2 years, worked for a year before my back got too painful and debilitating. 

I became incredibly depressed and was hospitalised because I didn’t think I would be able to control the urge to kill my self. When hospitalised, for a month, I stopped eating and developed anorexia which I am still struggling with. After being released I was seen by my community mental health team weekly for a year and had regular phone calls. It was during this time, through assessments and talking therapy that they landed on bpd as a diagnosis as well as anxiety, anorexia, self harm and dissociative amnesia. I only received the official diagnosis a couple of years ago. I’m not medicated but having the understanding has made a difference but I still struggle.

Relationships are HARD. My family treat me like crap and they lie and they don’t acknowledge any of what has happened to me (I was also sexually assaulted in my late teens by some people who lived in my village, and was raped just a month after being discharged from psychiatric hospital). I have pretty much cut ties with my family now. I think I always expect and need more from relationships than others because I don’t have that “family love” most people have. I’m also constantly scared people are going to just suddenly decide they hate my guts and leave. (When I was being admitted to hospital one of my best friends who had bipolar and who I had always supported, upon me reaching out for help, told me to “never contact me again”, and another one of my best friends did the same after I told them I was raped). It hurts because I don’t understand why this happens to me. People always seem to turn on me Eventhough all I ever do is try and be a decent human being, be there for people and treat them how I would want to be treated. When I do get upset I am scared to tell that person in fear that they will stop being my friend and when I get overwhelmed I become vicious. Whilst I am doing well with learning not to act quickly, I still falter sometimes. Especially when I speak with my dad who was absent for most of my life. However, I have a fiancé who I have been with for four years and he is wonderful and very supportive. I do just tend to find that people suddenly stop liking me and people will hear a lie about me and will believe that and have a go at me without even talking to me about it. And when people find out what has happened to me in my life they tend to ignore it and act like I’m lying or something.

I also have a video on my channel that I filmed just after I told a friend that I had BPD and it is very raw and could be triggering but might help you understand this a bit better.

I get incredibly overwhelmed very easily and I get incredibly upset and angry at how unfair the world is. I am sure that sounds childish but I did everything I was supposed to do. I was a grade a student, I always worked my ass off, I was hardworking, ambitious, good at what I did, treated people well, and the world has just taken so much from me. Because I was never able to properly grieve my mums death and was never given counselling at the time. I think that has made a big difference. But my family has too. My Nan died in October - she was like a second mum to me, and my uncle decided to message me to tell me then refused to answer the phone or reply to my questions - I’m sorry but I don’t think that’s okay.

Sorry I know that’s a lot but I wanted to try and answer as much as I could. As I’ve said there are some videos if you want to watch them (I’m not trying to push you to do that I just want you to know in case. Just search for kezandunicorns on YouTube or via my twitter/ Instagram @kezandunicorns if you want to). Also, please do let me know if something isn’t clear or if you have any more questions. I am an open book so I will share anything I can with you if it could help you. I’m happy to share publicly but if you prefer dm that’s fine too.

I hope this helps a bit, and I’m happy to explain more / answer more questions. Also, sorry for the delayed reply, but it’s difficult writing all this out and I needed to take the time to do this right."

Honestly; I actually tried to kill my self before and succeeded. I flatlined for a short amount of time but they were able to bring me back and I remember waking up, confused and having this feeling of despair like “why?! Why am I still here?” My mum committed suicide when I was 15 and the pain has never gone away. I hate when people say “time heals all wounds etc” because it doesn’t, I think wounds and scars just become a part of who we are and we carry all of that with us through our life. Honestly, I’ve considered killing my self a number of times since the lockdown. That’s why I joined reddit. I wanted to see if my experiences and feelings might be able to connect with someone else and help them in some way. I know that sounds cheesy but it’s true.

depression_help,fpfxq3j,t3_gd5wr9,1588587466.0,"I'm not sure where you are in the world so I don't know if what I have to say will be relevant. I am based in the UK so our legal system/benefits etc may or may not be different to yourself so please take that into account.

In the UK... you can't be fired for having ""ill-health"" (supposedly. I suffer from incredibly acute and debilitating chronic back pain which leaves me often in too much pain to get out of bed. I found that many companies would find a ""reason"" to terminate my contract. At the time of realising that I couldn't work anymore my mental health deteriorated and I just let it happen. The thing is, I was pulling in great results and was good at my job. If I had gone down a legal route of ""unfair dismissal"" I should have won. Unfortunately I didn't do that so we will never know. HOWEVER, I was once signed off ""officially"" by my doctor and because I kept providing ""official unable to work"" notices from my doctor, the company I worked with had to keep paying me my full monthly pay for 12months before the contract was agreeably terminated. So providing proof from a doctor always seems to pay off - though I understand this may not be possible where you are, and with being depressed - I am so sorry you are going through this and I can relate a LOT.

If you are unable to work, in the UK, you would be entitled to Universal Credit along with housing benefit, council tax reductions etc and, if your health is a consideration, depending on length of time - you could be entitled to Personal Independence Payment, and/or a payment for people unable to work through poor health.

If you are not in the UK, I don't know if this will help but because I have been in a very similar situation I wanted to share this information with you, just in case. Again, I am so sorry you are feeling the way you are, struggling, and that your work are treating you like they are (they sound horrid and I think you should leave but that is my personal opinion and as it is a big thing in your life, don't consider my initial outrage at your work as actual advice).

This sounds horrible and I completely understand what you mean about being invalidated with people saying “everyone feels sad at the moment”.

I also relate to the fact that friends don’t try to help. When I my mental health got really bad a couple of years ago I actually had some of my best friends tell me to never contact them again. People suck.

But I’m here and I’m always happy to listen. I’m not sure where in the world you are - I’m in the UK (to give you an idea of time zones) but please don’t suffer like this on your own.

depression_help,fomuv2u,t1_fom1ij7,1587904567.0,"Okay, thank you for giving me some context on where exactly you are living. I made a guess that you were somewhere else - don’t ask me why.

In that case, all I can say is that this is a truly horrible situation and I am so sorry. I wish I could do more but given what you’ve told me the only thing I can really recommend is to be there for her. With the last point you mentioned, I understand your concern however, weed is not physically or biologically addictive. While the habit can become an addiction if it got too much and she needed to come off of it her body would be safe. I think at this time the best thing you can do is share your worries but ultimately let her make her own decisions, be there for her and don’t judge her too harshly or try and control her (it seems her father does that too much already). Just let her know she is can make her own decisions and even if you don’t agree with them you will, ultimately, support her at this time. Sometimes things like smoking can really help - ideally if she was only doing it a little and not all the time / but if this is something she wants to
So for herself, it’s good that she is trying to think about ways to make her happier and able to survive. It’s when she gives up that you really need to worry.

Just be there for her, love her, remind her of her awesomeness, share your concerns but support her decisions. 

I truly am sorry that the situation is as bad as it is and I thank you for answering everything the way you did as it did help me see just how horrible this situation is. When in a situation like your girlfriends, having the smallest bit of freedom and ability to make her own decisions will make a big difference, and having someone who truly loves her and supports her will too.

I’m sorry I can’t do more to help. But I think she is very lucky to have someone like you. It sounds like people like yourself are rare where you live. I believe you are just what she needs to get through this and if you both have each other, plan for your future while at university then you will both get through this. 

Sending lots of love your way. If things get worse then you always have this place to come to if you need more advice
