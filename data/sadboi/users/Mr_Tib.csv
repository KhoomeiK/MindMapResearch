bipolar,fqk940l,t1_fqk6l5p,1589422536.0,"Thank you for that.  Sometimes I'm afraid that my hypomania episodes can be too good and addictive in a way, maybe turn into substance abuse or whatever you know? I always take my meds now and remain stable and sometime in too much ""meh"", or so it feels."
bipolar,fqk8uox,t1_fqk63vs,1589422393.0,"Honestly, looking back, probably around 15 years, I'm 31 now. I was diagnosed just about a year ago."
bipolar,fqk5mt0,t1_fqjmqh0,1589420613.0,"I know, downside is I did do a lot of stupid shit while hypomanic but I do miss it at times."
bipolar,fqj6ozp,t1_fqj6dqg,1589405783.0,I'm glad you are at that state where you feel content with life in general. Learning to smell the flowers so to speak and appreciate the little and simple things in life is hard but well worth it.
bipolar,fqj6dt6,t1_fqj5hh9,1589405662.0,"I know what you mean , alcohol triggers hypomania for me and in that moment I had a blast. That same magnitude of mania hit the very next day when I woke up in form of depression, guilt, self hate and just... misery. 

&#x200B;

When I'm stable, I look back at the highlights of my life and 80% of that is while being hypomaniac."
bipolar,fqj5zkt,t1_fqj37c2,1589405509.0,"I'm scared of spending my life in that meh state. When I'm doing mundane tasks or listening to a song I once heard while relaxing at a bar being hypomaniac it brings me back and makes me miss that state, although I do recognize it's high risk, but still..."

conspiracy,fkz76bw,t1_fkz6jjq,1584664308.0,"Will do, thanks  for the advice. Fighting against an AI always seemed pointless to me since it can gain knowledge exponentially and we are bound by our biological limitations. What are your thoughts on it?"
conspiracy,fkz65si,t1_fkz482w,1584663646.0,Can you point me somewhere I can start reading on adrenochrome? I keep seeing it referenced but I'm out of the loop. Thanks
conspiracy,fkz5zt1,t1_fkz4895,1584663541.0,What are our alternatives at this point?
wherearetheynow,firwx7i,t1_firhku7,1582672732.0,"Yeah, that's him! Thank you. I hope he's doing well wherever he is. He seemed like an honest, simple guy that genuinely enjoyed playing, making videos while balancing his family life. He wasn't trying to sell merch or anything like that. He just did it for fun. I like that. I like you too for helping me find him again."
IWantOut,f9o9kgk,t1_f9n72by,1575499407.0,That Germany deal sounds interesting. Any specific place to look for more info on this?
IWantOut,f9luc9g,t1_f9l6i3j,1575432227.0,"I get what got mean. Honestly I'd rather move to Canada. My wife's been interested in moving to the US for a while now. We are looking for a fresh start and a change in scenery. Since we don't have kids yet we figured it would be the right time.  Also, I think we both agree Mexico is not the safest place to live."
IWantOut,f9ltwpo,t1_f9l6i3j,1575431903.0,"Wife's leaning more towards the US but I'd rather move to Canada. Beggars can't be choosers though, so I'll look into moving to either."
IWantOut,f9ltto2,t1_f9l7ps7,1575431836.0,Thanks for the help. I'll be going over all those in depth.
IWantOut,f9ltlzb,t1_f9lhum1,1575431677.0,"Let's try it for 6 months and see how it goes lol. Yeah, I've been to all those and it's really relaxed and beautiful. When I travel nationally, I keep returning to those destinations. I'm leaning towards Canada I think. Healthcare in the US sucks as far as I can tell."
IWantOut,f9l4i0t,t1_f9l34ij,1575414250.0,Tired of the US?

depression,etxq3k3,t3_cd6d58,1563304859.0,Yes! I've noticed that pattern. My doc says I may be Bipolar II. She says it is often misdiagnosed for depression.
