relationship_advice,fp8q5vg,t1_fp7b70u,1588399407.0,How long were you in that situation for? And if you don’t mind me asking how did that end?
relationship_advice,fp8q37u,t1_fp6i0vw,1588399343.0,"He’s said he’s scared to have a break as he’s never done that before and that he doesn’t think we’re that bad and how can I just throw our relationship away. We do have, or did have a really good relationship but now I feel it was based on and don’t know what to believe."
relationship_advice,fp8pw8i,t1_fp69w45,1588399176.0,I just don’t understand what would have been wrong with honesty when we first started seeing each other. I have suggested that we have space but he has said he is scared to as he’s never had that before and still hasn’t left. I think what makes it worse is that more lies keep coming out and I just don’t know what is the truth and how he really feels or what he wants.
relationship_advice,fp8phg9,t1_fp6b4ur,1588398823.0,"He said that he is and he was just trying to maintain the friendship with her but I’m  not sure. His friends are still messaging him about her and vice verse. He is saying I’m not letting myself trust him.. I also am now concerned he was sleeping with someone completely separate as he said he could have slept with someone else if he didn’t have feelings for me, as in, someone was contacting him trying to ‘catch up’ and he turned them down - however, it came out after I posted this that they did catch up but he is saying it was nothing sexual. I just don’t know what to believe anymore. 

And yes he keeps saying things like ‘do you think we’re really that bad, do you want to throw us away?’ and that he’s scared because he’s never had a ‘break’ in a relationship before."

ptsd,fh6gw68,t3_f18z9g,1581298799.0,"I think that the term survivor is used in many different ways, but I don’t believe it doesn’t mean you are still a victim, for example- 

Someone who has been a victim of something of something, surviving, and staying strong making it through a terrible situation and making it too the other side.

I think it all depends on how the term is used.

In saying that I do agree that it is often used the wrong way and I don’t agree how the term has been used to portray victim in the series’s 13 reasons why as it’s often hard for victims/survivors too speak up and doing so shouldn’t define if they are either a victim or survivor."

Hope this helps, you’ll get there it usually takes awhile to deal with a bad relationship and meeting someone you genuinely are into takes time as well. Also it is okay meet someone and figure they aren’t your type, you need attraction in a relationship."

Adelaide,es2wb94,t3_c5lgdf,1561544064.0,"The bus services are unreliable in Adelaide, I’ve had buses run early, late or just never come at all. Drivers that just keep driving and bus drivers that miss your stop, one had 5 people telling the driver to stop and he still kept going which lead to a half and hour walk home in the rain as it was the last bus. As someone who had to catch public transport into the city to avoid hefty parking fees I’ve always planned things ahead of the bus schedule to avoid being late, even then sometimes that doesn’t work out and then an extra 1-2 hours has been wasted waiting around for nothing but usually it does work. So yes you’re not alone. Stick to the train service if possible. Trains are generally reliable and quicker."
