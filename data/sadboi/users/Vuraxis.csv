>To find God boring is to find everything God made as boring which certainly isn't your motive since you explained you like stuff.

I can enjoy Lego but still find the guy who invented them completely uninteresting.

Plus, unlike Jesus who I think is a shallow guy, I admittedly do find God interesting in a way, because I think he's the most terrifying force ever (which is why I'm happy there's no evidence for his existence wahaaay). What else but an evil entity would create an afterlife system so incredibly unfair that 99% of people have to endure flames, forever, with no second chances, regardless of how moral they are? This kinda thing is probably why Satan rebelled. I'd rather live the life of Corey Wise than go through the afterlife system. 

I still think that worshipping him quite as intensely as you apparently do is still boring in itself, because humans are not meant to give up all the things that make them appealing for worship I'm pretty sure. It's almost kinda sad in a way given how willingly blind to science you have to be to believe in God these days, and also sad because the wrath of God means this makes you look like a slave begging to for mercy everyday. I sound like a horrible person saying that and I don't mean to be, I'm just pointing out what the image you're painting by saying you think about how to serve God 'every hour and moment'.
