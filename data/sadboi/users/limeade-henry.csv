My second disagreement was over the legality of abortion, but again I still believed in the church on a spiritual level.
My third disagreement was over the pedophile priest scandal, but I stayed because I thought at the time it was just a case of some individuals in the clergy committing acts of sin.
The final straw that lead me to distance myself from the catholic church was when it became apparent that they'd been responsible for covering up the abuse and severity of it for so long. 
I still occasionally attend mass and church events with my family, although I avoid participating in any meaningful way. I find myself still following certain rules of the church; such as avoiding meat on Fridays during lent. And I think there are valuable lessons in the Bible and good people in the church both now and in history....but in terms of my spirituality I am agnostic and not really in a place where I feel prepared to make a decision on which side to choose regarding religion vs atheism."
