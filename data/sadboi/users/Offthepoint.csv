Most likely, you'll need to live in one of the outer boroughs (Staten Island, The Bronx, Brooklyn or Queens), as Manhattan is ridiculously expensive. Finding a job? It depends on what field you're interested in. Remember, there will be a lot of competition, so you'll have to be up on your game to find some work.
