Without detailing in depth everything that happened/was said it‚Äôs near impossible for you to give me a better answer than you did. I appreciate you taking the time to give me what insight you can off what I‚Äôve said. It‚Äôs much appreciated and even though you may not think so, it is very helpful.

I am currently waiting on a list of psychiatrists from my insurance to get a second opinion and maybe someone more well informed on lithium. Till then I‚Äôm thinking I may have to suffer with the vest until I can get another doctor to back me up that it‚Äôs unnecessary."
BipolarReddit,fr0y4ei,t1_fr0q0wr,1589809401.0,"It‚Äôs not as if anyone‚Äôs got a gun to my head saying I must. As it‚Äôs an ADA accommodation, I don‚Äôt know if they can fire me if I do become toxic at work while not wearing the vest. I‚Äôm not real sure how that part of it works. So say I just decide to stop wearing it, I doubt anyone would say anything, but then I get lithium toxicity, have to go to internal health services, they send me to er, I have to be out of work.... so on... That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reluctant to stop wearing it without knowing more."
BipolarReddit,fqztjgv,t1_fqzko2k,1589775034.0,"It is extremely complicated. The severe tremors is the only symptom I had. I think since I was fine and had no signs of toxicity after I got home from work she felt it was nothing to worry about. Honestly, I‚Äôm going on a year on lithium. I have researched as much as I can on my own. I‚Äôm beginning to think that my current psychiatrist may not be well informed other than basics when it cones to this med. that‚Äôs beside the point though. Right now my only concern is just not having to wear the awful ice vest..."
BipolarReddit,fqzt8aa,t1_fqze2im,1589774819.0,"It‚Äôs waaaayyy too much to explain in detail everything that went down... I will just leave it at this: no, my blood level was fine. I was very new to lithium and hadn‚Äôt fully researched yet. I was solely taking my psychiatrist at her word. After much googling and such since last year I‚Äôm starting to think my psychiatrist may not be super familiar with lithium toxicity. I now know what I need to do to prevent it and how to minimize my tremors and all. As such I am considering going to someone else but that‚Äôs difficult and a time consuming process.

My main concern is getting rid of the awful vest... :/"
BipolarReddit,fqyqhn7,t1_fqy4g0g,1589752871.0,Well I had to go to internal health and they were unconcerned. But the nurse said I should consider going hone till I talked to my psychiatrist. I was able to talk to her on the phone the next day and she seemed unconcerned at first and then called me back that evening saying she had discussed it with a colleague and that she believed it was toxicity after all and that I was to stay off work till I got an accommodation in place...

BipolarReddit,fqy04lz,t1_fqxxzod,1589740469.0,"I don‚Äôt check my levels as often as I should... about every two or three months or so. When the first instance happened, I didn‚Äôt think I was toxic. I thought it was a combination of first day back at work with no ramp up (we‚Äôre called factory athletes because of the amount of physical activity we do), and just tremors in general because my tremors were already bad when I was first put on it.

My psychiatrist, I personally think, overreacted. By the time I had gotten in touch with her I was perfectly fine again. I was actually perfectly fine by the time I made it home from my half day at work. Since I was fine with no symptoms she didn‚Äôt recommend getting my levels checked. As I was fairly new to it all I didn‚Äôt think of going to er. I work second shift so this was like 10pm. I did however get my levels checked the day after I spoke with her and they were normal. Actually low considering my dosage. Came in at .6.

infertility,fqi2d0m,t3_giw78e,1589388619.0,Going to take progesterone suppositories for the first time this Thursday and unsure what to expect.

TTC_PCOS,fqi1ja1,t3_gismhn,1589388229.0,"I take some form of progesterone to initiate a period. I don‚Äôt ‚Äútry‚Äù during that time. However once my cycle starts after the progesterone I‚Äôve been prescribed first clomid (did nothing), and now letrezole. Both of these induce ovulation if you‚Äôre on the right dose for you. This last round of letrezole I did follicle scans. Had a 17mm follicle on CD18 and did a trigger shot (pregnyl) on CD19. Was intimate the following three cycle days. I am going to do a progesterone suppository this Thursday CD24 to aid in hopefully preventing another CP.

Don‚Äôt know if any of this helps you, but this is what I‚Äôve been doing. Make sure you ask your dr about how the progesterone is supposed to help and if they are willing to do extra testing to detect ovulation. I have no personal experience, but from what I gather, OPKs are not always an effective way to detect ovulation in PCOS women.

Best of luck to you!"

As for the suppositories, it‚Äôs just an added measure to prevent another CP. I don‚Äôt know how it would effect blood levels either. If this round is a bust I‚Äôll mention these things next go. Thanks again for your input!"
TTC_PCOS,fqexeq5,t1_fqevlk3,1589315177.0,This. Yes. That‚Äôs what I needed to know! I don‚Äôt know when I ovulated exactly.

TTC_PCOS,fqef92j,t1_fqeeahb,1589306573.0,Oh... I feel I should tell you. I did provera/letrezole in February as well with no period in sight. It was April when my dr prescribed it again for the next round and no signs of a period coming.
TTC_PCOS,fqeep7m,t1_fqeeahb,1589306316.0,"I so feel you. However I have no idea when my next period may be. I literally just don‚Äôt have them without inducing them via some form of medication (ie.

TTC_PCOS,fqe63zg,t3_gieryl,1589302361.0,"I‚Äôm not the best for advice. I will tell you my experience though.

I was diagnosed with PCOS at 21. I did nothing to manage it aside from BC until my husband and I were in a place to TTC. I now take metformin (was taking 1500mg and am advocating to have it increased to 2000mg because I‚Äôve seen no difference). That is the only thing I‚Äôm doing specifically to manage the PCOS.

As for the fertility aspect... I tried progesterone/clomid for about 14 cycles. That is excessive given my age but it‚Äôs what we chose. Now I‚Äôm seeing an RE and I‚Äôm within my first timed monitored intercourse. I took provera/letrezole, then had a follicle scan on CD14 and again CD18. Had a promising follicle so I did a trigger shot (pregnyl) on CD19. Now I wait.

As for treatment of PCOS without TTC r/PCOS is also really helpful. There are lots of options for TTC with PCOS.

I doubt any of this was super helpful. Just know that it may be harder than simply having sex, but PCOS is considered a mild issue when TTC. I tend to disagree as I‚Äôm living it and it hasn‚Äôt been mild for me... but ya know.

Good luck!"

I came upon him while googling REs in my area. I don‚Äôt have many options. I‚Äôd already seen one and hated him, this one I‚Äôve loved from day one. Thing is, when I called to verify that he was covered on my insurance they said he‚Äôs listed simply as an OBGYN. He takes high risk cases though, which I may be due to meds. So I‚Äôm sticking with him.

Maybe I should have put all that in my post.... does it change your answer? Even knowing that I‚Äôm not super concerned about the symptoms but more the infertility aspect?

The worst part is... I‚Äôve outed myself to people I‚Äôve grown close to. People that get to know me on a very personal level.

My story... I had a vertical hood piercing done when I was 20. It was no big thing but I always mentioned it at the drs because, well, they‚Äôre down there and I don‚Äôt want them to be surprised when they see something silver flashing around! All the males I had been to had either asked a single question regarding it or dismissed it completely. One of the female drs I saw commented about it a few times before the exam and then during the exam gave it almost like a little flick. Doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôd be much... but let me tell you though... for anyone who has never had that piercing, it makes your clit SUPER sensitive. Her one minor flick, so to speak, was the equivalent of placing a vibrator on my clit for a split second. It was extremely awkward for me. Needless to say I never went back to her!

BipolarSOs,fnsnsx2,t3_g3jmz4,1587225363.0,"My husband and I (F Bipolar mixed episodes) have been married 12 years, together close to fifteen.

I have been absolutely a mess probably more than not. However I am solid with taking my meds and going to therapy the last three or four years and it‚Äôs made a world of difference.

You can only take care of yourself. From your comments it seems you need to really buckle down on self care and committing to no substance abuse. Get into therapy and take your medicine religiously, your life literally depends on it.

My husband once told me after a few years together why he was able to make our relationship work so well. He said that every relationship he‚Äôd had prior to me was miserable and failed and he thought he‚Äôd never get married because it just wasn‚Äôt worth it. He said that one day he was reflecting on his numerous failed relationships and realized there was only one consistency, himself. He decided to change himself and be a better person. He made the commitment to be the best he could be and take care of him only. Because he was so confident with himself when I came along and such a strong individual without the need of another person, he was able to commit and see the good in me and that it outweighed the negative. He was able to self care and therefore helping me wasn‚Äôt such a burden.

You have to self care. You have to take responsibility for yourself. You have to commit to being better. Until you can do that, you won‚Äôt be able to have a healthy relationship with anyone else. My husband figured that out, I however struggled with it for quite a bit longer. Just fortunately he was in such a good place we still managed."

I can see where you are coming from with how it‚Äôs possible. I love your thoughts on it. I just can‚Äôt, in my own mind, ever justify going against my nature to bring justice where it‚Äôs needed when justice can be found by staying true to my beliefs and values. It may not be a quick process as it would be to do as you say, but it, for me, would be more rewarding if done while maintaining my good nature, loyalty, and kindness to all."
HarryPotterBooks,fnsdkw2,t3_g3nmci,1587219292.0,"I‚Äôm struggling with your concept of the ‚ÄúDark Hufflepuff‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard for me to imagine anyone with Hufflepuff traits being hypocrites with their beliefs. As Hufflepuff are typically good by nature and deem what you have mentioned as their morals I can‚Äôt fathom how you can manipulate that into a negative.

That said, I believe it‚Äôs possible to utilize the strengths of a puff to overrule. Just maybe not by hypocrisy of the beliefs. As a puff myself, I tend to utilize my kindness and acceptance to my benefit. I gain people‚Äôs trust and loyalty by giving trust and loyalty. I am able to pull people into my inner circle and have them follow me (not in a militant or political way, but as close friends) simply by exuding and being true to the cores of Hufflepuff.

I imagine it‚Äôd actually be easiest for Hufflepuffs to gain followers and believers by being true to themselves more so than by utilizing what they brand for themselves as the traits hypocritically. All in all, a genuine Hufflepuff, to me, has the potential to make a great leader.

As for your question and based solely off the information you gave, of the three, I‚Äôd say ravenclaw, then gryfindor, then Hufflepuff.

But of course, as a puff, and with the information I gave, I think we‚Äôd have the strongest chance of gaining followers and therefore we‚Äôd stand a better chance than based off your perspective.

This was fun to consider, thanks for it!

TL;DR: puffs wouldn‚Äôt be that way in my opinion. Ravenclaw, gryfindor, puffs to answer. Still think puffs have a pretty good chance based off my beliefs."

I‚Äôm not great with how to evaluate cycles but I can tell you I ovulated way late, over a year ago, resulting in a chemical pregnancy. I think I got the positive on cd64 and as it was a chemical pregnancy I would only have been like a week or less. Make of that what you will. I had no symptoms that I noticed of ovulation but did start having just two symptoms of pregnancy which is why I tested.

Due to PCOS and just general paranoia I‚Äôve gotten my hopes up so many times just to be disappointed that I‚Äôm beyond believing my symptoms are due to pregnancy.

I‚Äôm actually at the drs right now for an ultrasound (basically maintenance until we attempt iui later this year/beginning of next) and I‚Äôm using this as my method to find out if I‚Äôm pregnant for the time being. It‚Äôs too much strain on my already fragile mental health to do it at home.

I‚Äôve been feeling off for a few weeks now. Some things I‚Äôve NEVER experienced before. Of course there‚Äôs other factors involved that have me convinced that it‚Äôs in no way pregnancy. I just never can fully get rid of every bit of hope... so it‚Äôs there, even if it is tiny."
TrueOffMyChest,fml7g60,t3_fvxxa4,1586180460.0,"I am like you, not opposed to guns/gun owners, could care less about the politics behind it.

I will NEVER own a gun nor do I want one now. I‚Äôm fortunate to live in a low crime area, so there‚Äôs that. I may feel different if I didn‚Äôt. We have a security system. We keep all doors and windows locked. Right now we‚Äôre home 24/7 so I‚Äôd be dead if someone robbed me at gun point and wanted to kill me. If they waited till I was gone, well, that‚Äôs what insurance is for.

Even with all that though, I know, deep down, that even if my life were on the line, I do not think I could shoot another person. Now... if my husband wanted a gun, he could have one, and if he thought he was capable of doing it, I‚Äôd be forever grateful for his ability to protect us.

Please don‚Äôt think this is accusatory or rude... purely curious... do you think the symptoms for the proceeding 12 weeks would have happened had you not tested?

It‚Äôs not so much that I only have a few at a time, it truly is that I‚Äôm super selective of who I consider friend. I also will drop friendships that become toxic. I have removed a few friends over the years because the relationships became unhealthy.

Overall I just have high standards and know my worth. Not everyone who is nice to me and I‚Äôm cool with (for lack of a better term) is worth truly putting my efforts into. It took me years to figure that out though."

As for whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúme or her with the problem‚Äù to put it extremely loosely, you‚Äôre right, it is a combination. She lets people in pretty easily and is overly trusting, but in the time I‚Äôve known her she‚Äôs only truly gotten close with two other people. The rest, it seems, she just likes to vent to about trivial life problems. She‚Äôs been hurt a lot in her life. I imagine she wants the friendship so much that she‚Äôs willing to make it more than it is while also attempting to not let the wrong people in. I do feel for her. Just not enough to be more than simply coworkers who talk often, hence my selectivity is partly the problem as well."
CasualConversation,fm4kxxi,t3_ft1kst,1585756067.0,"I do not call anyone friend until trust and mutual bonding has taken place. That includes people I hang out with outside of work. On the flip side, I don‚Äôt have to hang out with someone away from mutual common space to consider them friend if the trust and mutual bonding can take place there.

For me personally friendship is all about the connection I feel with a person more than how much/when/where we hang out. If that true bonding hasn‚Äôt taken place then they are simply someone I know, inside or outside work.

I‚Äôve only ever had what you‚Äôre asking about happen once. A woman at work and I hung out once outside work and talk daily inside work. I‚Äôve yet to feel bonded with her but if you asked her I‚Äôm one of her best friends. She even considered having me be a bridesmaid (insert eye roll...)."

If he can manage his own health long enough to continue trying then he needs to see a therapist for himself. His seeing a therapist will allow him a place to maintain his own mental health while giving him the tools to communicate effectively and see warning signs of things getting worse.

An Unquiet Mind by Kay Redfield Jamison would be a great book for both of them to read. Kay is a psychiatrist with Bipolar Disorder.
