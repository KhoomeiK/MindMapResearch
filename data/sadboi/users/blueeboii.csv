schizophrenia,fqn13yd,t1_fqmztqh,1589486901.0,"Thanks for the resources I‚Äôll look into them now! It means a lot that you took the time to reply so thanks. Yeah I was on tablets, taking 5mg daily.. it wasn‚Äôt a lot of meds but it was incredibly debilitating to me."
schizophrenia,fo7fx7j,t1_fo7enj5,1587577657.0,I do that all the time it‚Äôs like you know me lol.
schizophrenia,fo7ftq1,t1_fo5razb,1587577610.0,"I don‚Äôt really have a good psych doc, idk if it‚Äôs the case with everywhere in the UK but my doctor changes all the time so I can‚Äôt really build a relationship with them. I don‚Äôt have any positive symptoms, mostly just side effects from the meds that I don‚Äôt like at all. I‚Äôm just a bit of a mess rn, but I appreciate you leaving a comment lol. Thanks though, it‚Äôs kinda hard to tell people that you feel suicidal and my dad definitely didn‚Äôt understand."
schizophrenia,fo7fixh,t1_fo5klaf,1587577466.0,"Yeah it definitely sucks, what‚Äôs worse is that I didn‚Äôt really get any help? I just got discharged after a day and there were no med changes."
schizophrenia,fo7ff9w,t1_fo6msq2,1587577417.0,"Thank you. I‚Äôm doing okay, I‚Äôm struggling with the meds and stuff rn."

schizophrenia,fo7f5lq,t1_fo647ji,1587577287.0,"No I know that other people love and care about me, it‚Äôs just that now that I‚Äôm not psychotic I can see how much I put other people through when I am and I don‚Äôt want to live with medication and shit idk it‚Äôs just a lot to take on. 
I understand that I‚Äôm not the only one with schizophrenia that‚Äôs part of the reason why I‚Äôm here, to reach out and talk to other people with it so I can form a sort of network for myself."
schizophrenia,fo7evqa,t1_fo78nrv,1587577154.0,Yeah I like baths that‚Äôs usually what my go to is.

bipolar,fkdm8lz,t3_fhoky7,1584084559.0,If you‚Äôre taking medication it could be it. Try resetting your sleeping pattern by setting an alarm clock for earlier in the day. That‚Äôs if you want to make it better.
schizophrenia,fjzq9t7,t3_ffm0u6,1583726164.0,Omg I love your art style I am OBSESSED

schizophrenia,fjyvd7t,t1_fjyd9qa,1583705385.0,"I‚Äôm glad that you seem successful, I‚Äôve been worried that with this illness I won‚Äôt amount to anything. Which is a shame because I‚Äôm actually quite smart. Congratulations on the kids btw that‚Äôs huge! Idk what archons are."
schizophrenia,fjybmg8,t1_fjxxh2r,1583693531.0,How‚Äôs that working for you? I wish I could do that because my problem is without the meds I could go like 14 days without sleep and become psychotic.
schizophrenia,fjw51nu,t3_feydso,1583635231.0,This is so cool I love it
schizophrenia,fj5kncn,t1_fj5jw84,1583035102.0,Irish actually so not far off lol!

schizophrenia,fj4r4mq,t1_fj4ql7d,1583014896.0,Sounds really cool I could never dye my hair purple though I‚Äôd never be able to pull that off and I‚Äôm not that brave.
schizophrenia,fj4qd6h,t1_fj4q9fl,1583014373.0,"Omg thanks so much, tbh it‚Äôs a mess rn I dyed my hair when I was manic and it came out ginger rather than blonde lol. Getting it all cut off soon hopefully if I can manage to get out of bed for it lol."
schizophrenia,fj4pwed,t1_fj4poso,1583014050.0,Hey what‚Äôs up :)
schizophrenia,fi5i32t,t1_fi5ezub,1582163610.0,Well that‚Äôs good that you have a good circle of friends that you can rely on- I don‚Äôt really have that anymore. Scizoaffective disorder kind of took that from me. I‚Äôm probably the worst case people have seen.
schizophrenia,fi5eolz,t1_fi5eiie,1582161432.0,Omg I feel so sorry for you I couldn‚Äôt imagine going through school with this! It must be so tough. It only started for me when I was at university and that made me drop out. Hope everything is good with you though.
Psychosis,fi5eap7,t1_ff1uutz,1582161175.0,Hey I‚Äôm just seeing your reply- yes I come across like a complete zombie and I have no idea how to not come across that way. I‚Äôm getting a med change soon anyway so hopefully I‚Äôll be off this first gen antipsychotic and on something that agrees with me a little more.
schizophrenia,ff4i9id,t1_ff4hxzi,1579564262.0,"I might talk to my psychiatrist about trying it out, thanks for taking the time to reply! :)"
schizophrenia,ff48g7j,t1_ff3q9ib,1579557814.0,How do you find the invega sustenna? I‚Äôm looking to change meds for a period cause I‚Äôm currently on a first gen LAI.
Psychosis,ff47u91,t1_ff3th6t,1579557434.0,"Hi having read your post I think it wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea to start antipsychotics- they‚Äôve definitely helped me to be where I am right now. I‚Äôve had really similar beliefs/ thoughts as well and the meds definitely help keep me grounded. 

I think the best thing would be to take them and review how you feel in a few months. Seems to me you might be having some delusional thinking along with mania. Hopefully things are better in the future!"
Psychosis,fezvoz3,t3_equ8db,1579462265.0,"I just hate the meds that come with psychosis, they‚Äôre the main culprit in me feeling less emotional. Also feel like they get rid of huge amounts of my personality which sucks so much. Anyway if you ever need someone to talk to I‚Äôm always open for chatting :)"
