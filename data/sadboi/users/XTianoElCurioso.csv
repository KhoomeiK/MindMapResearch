AskReddit,fqv4q78,t1_fqtmbse,1589669833.0,This happened in the national health system in the uk a few years ago. Test email to 1 million people. A lot of them subsequently hit ‘reply all’ with stuff like ‘I think this wasn’t for me but maybe John from department x knows’. Took until the evening until anyone could send/receive emails again due to the ensuing chaos.

EatingDisorders,fpnufx8,t3_geh0bx,1588772823.0,"Hi! 
Well done for coming this far!
You could try with one of the recovery cook books like
- my super sweet recovery cookbook
- food to eat: guided, helpful and trusted recipes for Eating disorders recovery


On a different note- I don’t know you and so I wouldn’t want to make any assumptions about your life. But I still wonder whether your super busy lifestyle is a little bit of a save place for your eating difficulties to linger on in? Maybe I am wrong and if I am - this is meant as a hopefully helpful question to ask yourself. 
Hope that makes sense?! 
Be good to yourself"

Have you watched the documentary where some of the victims that where abused by him as children talk about having sex with him? Worth a watch. (Not for the sex part obs, but about the impact of sexual relationships with minors). I think it was Netflix ?"
EatingDisorders,fklkaxe,t3_fj0yc3,1584308300.0,"Sorry to hear that things are difficult. Remember that you have come to this point with all the experience and knowledge that got you better last time around! You can do this. 
Maybe think about whether you can talk to others in your life (in addition to Reddit) so that they can support? Have you ever had professional support? Therapy? Spoken to your GP / primary care provider?"
EatingDisorders,fk773gh,t1_fjl5f23,1583929564.0,"That is really difficult. I don’t think you can convince someone to do things or at least that is a lot of pressure to put on yourself. But you can offer to keep talking to them, be firm but gentle in your opinion and call emergency services if you ever fell it is needed. 
This is a difficult situation to be in. I am not sure there is a ‘perfect’ solution to this. Also make sure you take care of your own needs and mental health. Maybe find support for yourself too?"

I appreciate that money might be an issue and unfortunately I don’t know enough about the health system in the US to have any advice. but my take on this is that health needs to be the top priority even if money is tight."

I like the idea though"
EatingDisorders,fagpchy,t3_e95dik,1576066630.0,"Hi there! Well done for looking after yourself. I am sure there can be a number of reasons why people take laxatives. Maybe you can gently ask whether she is not well? That shows your care and it seems appropriate as she is not hiding the fact she is taking them. 
As you probably know better than anyone ‘coming out’ with eating difficulties might be difficult and she might tell you. 
Good luck!"
EatingDisorders,f8zb3hc,t3_e2eaqy,1574959194.0,I hope you find what you need! Take good care of yourself!
EatingDisorders,f8v6eme,t3_e2eaqy,1574861046.0,"I agree with the information about BEAT. 

Some eating disorders services provided by the NHS accept self-referrals. You can try and find your local service and ask what you need to do in order to be referred. Most services will require a referral from your GP. 
Sometimes it can be helpful to ask your GP directly to make a referral to an eating disorder service. 

Hope this helps and good luck with it!"
