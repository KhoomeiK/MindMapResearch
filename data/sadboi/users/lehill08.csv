socialwork,fkxqnyx,t3_flb3ip,1584633543.0,"This topic is incredibly frustrating for me. As social workers, we know that people who commit crimes most often do so because of life circumstances that led them on that path. Our environment makes us who we are. 

Supporting people who haven’t had a fair chance in life is what brought me to this field. It is our responsibility to advocate for people who need an extra leg-up in life and providing housing benefits is one of the most important supports a person can have when working towards their life goals. 

I hope that over time research will be utilized when making these decisions at the federal level - we know the positive impact that can come from changing these rules. Just need the people at the top to figure that out! 

More social workers in leadership roles, please!"
