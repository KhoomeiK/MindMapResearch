ptsd,f0vyz1z,t1_f0vnom2,1568995145.0,"And I'm so scared of passing it on, too, like my mother had a highly abusive mom and I don't think she's as bad as her, but there's still some remnants in her relationship to me. I wonder if I can ever be a good parent"
Aquariums,f0vtdmy,t1_f0vs3k1,1568991317.0,"Thanks. I just did the liquid kit, everything is normal. The filter is a good idea, through my old filter won't fit as it was already too big on it's own ((a hang in one)) and we've thrown out the nasty filter medium. I'll definitely remember that for future changes tho"
Aquariums,f0vq79y,t1_f0vpqn2,1568989040.0,"I didn't really have the option as I've had the fish for years and I have no second tank. This wasn't a new tank build, just a change of pump and scenery, if that makes sense. I used the plants, wood and at least fifty percent of the water from the previous setup to kinda try and prevent the worst"
AskReddit,ezzq0qa,t3_d2ujx3,1568291131.0,So there's this traditional ((I think German)) dish my mom makes which is basically mashed potatoes with nutmeg and root syrup sauce (optional bacon) and from experience I'd think he'd either hate it or be very intrigued

ptsd,ez74ek7,t3_d06nih,1567718772.0,I'd love to help but all I can really say is you're not alone. And that sometimes it's good to remember that people you chose to trust aren't necessarily like the people you were supposed to trust as a child. You have that power now. Idk it helps me a little

OneTopicAtATime,ez65su0,t3_czysx0,1567709248.0,I'm deeply sorry but at first glance I just saw two naked mole rats
ptsd,ez39e2b,t3_czwhvi,1567663215.0,"Well, it's not like you chose to have ptsd, and ptsd doesn't care about what people think. Plus I think even though it's just sports and blah blah blah, having any accident with long-term effects on the brain is obviously going to cause some emotional damage, the effects you described don't sound minor or funny at all. Screw those opinions. It seems kinda dumb to make the validation of pain of an accident dependant on the outer circumstances. That all aside pain shouldn't need an edgy story to be validated. I hope I'm making some sense, and best wishes"
ptsd,ez37992,t3_czgwxk,1567662147.0,"What bugs me (personally) most is that they imply it's like a minor grievance that will just go away with time, or that can be taken away, when actually there are these mountains of hard work you have to do to get better. People don't know that the hardest part is how you have to try and help yourself, actively decide to do so, and act on it, and try not to slip up over and over again after a while. Comments like that disregard these efforts, but I find things like ""i believe in you"" or ""idk how to deal with this but I'm here to help"" much more encouraging."
ptsd,eyzr0y1,t1_eyznou0,1567623312.0,"thanks, I'll look into it"
ptsd,eyzc64c,t1_eyz2wkm,1567614391.0,"Thanks, first of all! I really relate to the personality thing. I'd say I'm definitely not on the ace spectrum, I want physical contact and I could enjoy some of it in the one relationship I've had so far, but it took me extremely long to get used to it, e.g. a week for holding hands without panicking (actual heart racing, dizzyness, fear and stuff which I first thought was love but maybe love isn't supposed to feel like you might die any minute?) Kissing and the like are a whole different story. I kinda always thought I was just a huge prude, which makes no sense because I'm more ashamed of my fear, I'd love to enjoy physical stuff... Idk in retrospective I feel sorry for my ex because it must have been pretty obvious to her that I felt like just bolting whenever she tried sth. Aand I'm rambling. Thanks, anyway, I'm glad I'm not the only one with no clue about possible trauma"
ptsd,eyz1ju1,t3_czl2c3,1567607374.0,"Honestly, with the valium and missing passport and all it is probably the smartest not to go on that cruise for you, and maybe they had no other options for scheduling. But your brother throwing out your birth certificate seems kinda careless to me ( unless it was on accident, then nvm) It still might be just a huge misunderstanding, but maybe you could profit from a talk with him and/ or your mom? 
Best wishes"
