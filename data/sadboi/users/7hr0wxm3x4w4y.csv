The fact that boyfriend/so could have soothed her worries but chose not to for his own personal gain is, also IMO, gross. She wanted to hang out with her friends, that was no surprise. The real surprise was that she went 2 whole weeks thinking no one but her boyfriend/so liked her enough to want to spend time with her on her birthday.

I'm not adopted, but my JNGma used to tell me, as a child, that my mom was a whore and neither my sister and I were my fathers children. My father is her son. She would tell us how she forced them to get married so we would have a real family. Unfortunately he is my biological father.

Do you know how much it affected me as a child to think my father wasnt my father and he was forced to play house? 20ish years later and the only family members I speak to are my mother and my sister. My fathers entire bloodline is toxic abusive garbage. He never shyed away from beating my mother in front of us and threatening to kill us all. 

Dont let that foul creature infect those children, they're hurting enough mourning the loss of their parents. They dont need her faux silver lining morbid bullshit added on to that."

AmItheAsshole,exi49ab,t3_ct0uwv,1566320758.0,"NTA - her grief is a bit obsessive and extreme. Forcing it upon the extended family sounds like a cry for attention at this point. I believe she should absolutely seek counseling before her living children think they're being neglected and placed second to a miscarriage.

A good friend of mine carried her child to term but due to hospital malpractice, child died, suffocated in the birth canal. My friend buried her carried-to-term child, a child who absolutely could have survived outside of the womb. She did not put on a dog and pony show and force anyone else to grieve with her. Once a year she and her husband travel to the beach and grieve privately on the day the child died.

I completely understand that everyone grieves differently, but this is very unhealthy for everyone involved. Shes the asshole for expecting you to also feel her amount of grief and being angry for you not wanting to participate in, what should be, her private grieving process."
