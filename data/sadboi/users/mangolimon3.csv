trees,fqttee4,t1_fqtszbj,1589645746.0,"Idk depends on how dry it is where you.  In Texas I can leave buds out all day and because of the humidity, they won't really dry out much more than they already are.  In Colorado you leave some buds out for 15 minutes they get bone dry and harsh to smoke.  Get some boveda packs if you want to control the moisture.  

I only vape now and it seems like it vapes better when it's fairly dry, that's just my opinion though."

Also, I highly recommend the dynavap.  It's really efficient, and the taste you get is way better than smoking.  I've been a daily smoker for 10+ years and since I got the dynavap I only vape now.  Haven't hit a bowl, joint or blunt in months."

NuclearRevenge,fqrqful,t1_fqqtnug,1589589715.0,"Racism towards Mexicans has always been prevalent.  

In schools in Texas one of the ideals that always gets pushed is all the Tejano fighters at the Alamo and other battles of the Texas-Mexico War.  One thing they didn't tell us was that after the war Tejanos and Mexicanos that fought for Texas were not treated as equals, and were often lynched, or deported to Mexico, even though they were born in Texas. 

This preluded the mass deportation of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the 20s and 30s.  Many deported were birthright citizens of the US. 

On top of that there was the nation's first anti- marijuana laws that were passed due to (false) newspaper stories of Mexicans smoking weed and raping white women.  

Then later there was the Zoot Suit Riots in California that started between white US Navy men and the pachucos of LA.

There's hundreds of examples like this, these are just the few that I can think of off the top of my head."

In Texas, common carp are not invasive, but not native either.  They've been in the waters 100s of years. 

There is no law that requires them to be killed.  

They are edible, some people find them too oily.  

They also make good bait for alligator gar and catfish. 

They do not decimate the ecosystem, they are bottom feeders and the little ones are food for game fish like largemouth, stripers and catfish.
