Corporate will give manager a set amount of hours to doll out. If manager gives the full time employees all 40 hrs then someone calls in they have 5 options. work the call in hours on top of their own, ask part time to work extra. give a full time employee overtime which can get manager in trouble,  redo schedule disrupting the plans of possible many workers or work with out the employee affecting quality for consumer and distributing extra labor on everyone. We need a better balance between corporate greed and employee responsibility. People that need to call in should and its not your bosses business why but employees need to know that as it stands your putting a very real hardship on your boss and coworkers."

unpopularopinion,fq61wat,t1_fq5ziko,1589122759.0,Sorry i thought that this was about mental health support not domestic violence support. It is my belief that it is not toxic masculinity. The bigger issue is that no one cares. Women do not have support anymore than men in that area alone. Women are told to suck it up too it is not okay to have problems. Toxic masculinity is real and cruel but it is a symptom of nobody giving a shit not the reason that people don't give a shit.
unpopularopinion,fq5xtvp,t3_ggv4cl,1589120184.0,Are you making the distinction between killing an animal and euthanizing as in a better death? If that is the case it would be more humane to help someone peacefully die through euthanasia rather than a painful lonely death that if botched has the possibilities of adding more pain. I have had loved ones die from suicide and there are a lot of conflicting emotions but i also hate to think of their final moments being lonely and painful.
unpopularopinion,fq5wf3d,t3_ggv4cl,1589119213.0,This doesn't make sense because a person is choosing to euthanize a pet the animal isn't choosing that how does that relate to assisted suicide where a person decides that they don't want to live and need help euthanizing them self?
unpopularopinion,fq5ovxy,t1_fq3pifn,1589113197.0,Your making your comment assuming womens and childrens shelters are there for mental health and and not predominantly domestic violence issues which are two completely different things. even though they intertwine and even when they do intertwine the woman's mental health takes back seat to the children's safety and mental health.

unpopularopinion,fq5n0nq,t1_fq3x2qr,1589111426.0,Im sorry i am not in canada and would not know. Im not arguing that women do not have a support system when it comes to domestic violence but when it comes to Mental Health women do not have a support system anymore than men. When it comes to Mental Health the problem is that nobody gives a crap and gender doesn't really matter there are excuses the people come up with for why they don't want to help and sometimes they do use gender as an excuse but the truth is nobody really gives a shit there is no I'm going to help you because you're a female the only people that are going to help you are more often than not simply somebody that wants to take advantage of you while your vulnerable or people that don't want you to be become their problem.

unpopularopinion,fq200ec,t3_ggj5k7,1589051606.0,Women do not have support systems anymore than men do. The truth is no one cares until it affects them as well. So if your down and not hurting anyone it will seem like no one cares unless they realize that they can take advantage of your weakness.
unpopularopinion,fpxs11b,t1_fpvtyv1,1588988400.0,That is not in the least bit true. It only seems like that if you dont care about what they want or need. Screaming is the only way they can communicate feelings that they are not emotionally mature enough to verbalize.

SuicideBereavement,fnvw4d3,t1_fnvtv93,1587306157.0,Yes it is possible. Have you talked to your therapist and flat out said you are having trouble functioning at work? Ask your therapist about ptsd and tell them you are at your breaking point. Nothing in this world makes sense why should this? Its a horrible thing.  I wish i could make things better for you but i know thats not possible. i can tell you that what you are feeling is normal for us that have survived. You are not alone in how you feel. If talking hurts now try later in my experiance it can wash over you in waves . Sometimes you are okay sometimes not so much. You cannot force a wound to heal it has its own timeline but it will heal.
SuicideBereavement,fnvtote,t3_g46f8u,1587304480.0,Are you seeing a counselor? Even if you feel like you dont need one it may be beneficial. Ptsd is common among us survivors. If you cannot function at work because of a diagnosis you may be protected through hr depending on state laws or at least be laid off with unemployment. Even if there are no laws to protect most companies will not want to be seen as the douchebags that they are.  The added stress of being pressured at work while greiving is a nightmare. Enough to break anyone that is as vulnerable as you at this time. Try talking to a grief counselor to see if you have any options. Your boss is a piece of f****** s*** don't let him pressure you into losing your s*** and your job with it.
