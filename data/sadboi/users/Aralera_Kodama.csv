ptsd,fplqty0,t3_ge5te2,1588717717.0,"You took the first step and spoke up. Each of us have our own demons that we battle each day. Just look at the next few hours, get thru those. Don't look too far ahead because it gets overwhelming. Find a therapist to talk to over the phone. Binge watch some shows you enjoy. Maybe look into adopting a pet. I take anxiety medication to help with panic attacks. They don't always help and I end up in bed crying. People on hear understand and you may not have someone right there to talk, but we are on here. Life sucks but you keep.moving, even if its an inch a day. That is something. Believe in yourself, you are wonderful."

StarWars,foxyrz5,t3_g9wk89,1588160711.0,"This is so great! I put one together for my son when he was about 9 years old. Sadly, he passed away from Progeria at the age of 10 in 2006. I had it sitting in my game room when my 2 year old daughter pushed it off the table. I think I have all the pieces, so I just need to get the instructions and put it back together again. 

Nicely done!"

nintendo,fntjlq2,t3_g3ptch,1587242963.0,"April 16th was my son's birthday. He passed away at the age of 10. Every year me and my daughter send balloons off and I was worried we wouldnt be able to get balloons because we live in Michigan and non essential items are not allowed to be sold in stores due to the virus. I had emailed a local store that offered curb side pick up and asked if I could pick up some balloons for me, my daughter, and my husband (just married in September). She said she could have them ready and call when I arrive to pick them up.

We arrived on the 16th and I found out they had been paid for by some employees in the store. That was very touching and so kind!"
