Klonopin literally only makes me tired and slows my thoughts down. It also takes away the anxiety and stops the hypnic jerks that I was getting relentlessly. That's one of the big reasons I thought I had SFI, the jerks were constant, so the Klonopin has been so worth it.

Not trying to sway your decision one way or the other, but it really did save me from a really bad time when nothing else was working. Delusional thoughts, hallucinations, definitely mental decline, it was bad. I've benefited hugely from low dose clonozopam. In the long term, CBT absolutely.  75-100mg antihistamines weren't working for me because they didn't have an effect on the anxiety I had associated with sleeping and insomnia. Most of the drugs they were giving were simply antihistamines, so given that none worked, my choices were slim. You could try gabapentin, that was another that helped me."

I don't plan to stay on it for the long term, but I am grateful to have it now and that it has given me hope of getting my life back.

Well, mostly fine, I could at least accept a sleepless night or even a few.

There are a few things I know that I am doing wrong.

\#1- Like you said, reassurance seeking. I see a symptom, and I instantly develop it. It's how my anxiety works. Now instead of simply not being able to sleep I have 100 other things I'm worried about.

\#2- Covering up the problem with medication/alcohol/whatever, it diminishes sleep confidence. Obviously understandable if you haven't slept in a while and definitely need sleep, but not good to take continuously.. I haven't had a natural night of sleep in two months.

\#3- Constantly thinking about it, being stuck in my head, and not enjoying life. If you're thinking about sleep, you naturally won't be able to sleep.

Definitely things I'm working on, and I'm hoping to be a success story someday, too. :)"

stopdrinking,fivtavm,t1_fiun0p6,1582767582.0,"Yes, part of the reason for doing this was that I really miss waking up in the morning ready for the day, having energy. I've almost forgotten the feeling."

insomnia,finquf0,t1_fino9a8,1582568447.0,"I think you guys are really on to something. I've been reading about how Gabapentin affects sleep. Definitely going to ask my doctor about this one.

insomnia,fin3kxe,t3_f8rl5n,1582554930.0,"Our stories are so similar, I'm surprised! I guess I felt like I was the only one that had it present this way. For me it started in early January. My husband had a schedule change where he started working nights ad would come home in the morning and slept all day. It stressed me out so badly and the stress just kept compounding. I was so stressed that the smallest things made me super mad. I couldn't handle my kids because I was so unhappy. I got prescribed 20 xanax to help me through it because I was also losing a lot of sleep. I was able to sleep some, but had run of the mill insomnia with racing thoughts. When I didn't take xanax, I got hypnic jerks. So eventually I ran out of xanax. I have been out since February 14th, so it has been utter hell since then. I also had withdrawals from the xanax so I had days of extreme depression, anxiety, pretty much everything minus seizures.. I am happy to say that I'm 10 days off of that horrible drug, but I'm still not able to sleep. I know that I need something, but nothing the doctor has given me has worked because they don't stop the anxiety. I've been given trazodone, seroquel, mirtazapine, and hydroxyzine. Sure, they make me feel even more soul crushingly tired than I already am, but my brain is still wired to panic from the hypnic jerks and hypnogogic hallucinations. So now I'm just hoping and waiting for something that will help me. Doctors are quick to dismiss what they don't really understand. At least mine is."
insomnia,fimu0zt,t3_f8dgq0,1582546917.0,Can you repost?
insomnia,fimtp7q,t1_fiktkv2,1582546581.0,I'd be really interested in seeing your story! But it isn't showing up :(
insomnia,fimtcvd,t3_f8lcfx,1582546218.0,"1. I sometimes remember a dream if it's a deep, long and drawn out kind. These ease my anxiety a little bit because it tells me that I did sleep. 
2. I still feel exhausted both physically and mentally, but anxiety may also play a role in this.
3. Yes, I feel off most of the time these days. Just a fear I think of not being able to go back to normal again."
insomnia,fikmdm6,t1_fiklacz,1582483074.0,Was your doctor able to prescribe you anything that worked?
insomnia,fi24qkq,t3_f615zs,1582071427.0,"You're not alone at all, I'm also self medicating just to get crappy sleep. I was taking xanax but I'm out of that now so I drink myself to sleep every single night. I feel trapped and scared. We just need to hang in there with the hope that this won't last forever. I've been thinking, too, that the coping with benzos and alcohol just confused the central nervous system into thinking it needs those things to sleep. It's self regulating and will return to normal. Hang onto that. We'll make it through,"
stopdrinking,fi0ax7y,t3_f5iwd2,1582032236.0,"This is amazing, congratulations! I've been mainly lurking, I'm still afraid to make it a day.. but my life and my kid's lives and my family depends on it."
insomnia,fhxbmd0,t3_f4tqnf,1581950380.0,"You are not alone. Mine started in early January and I've had twitches preventing me from sleeping constantly. I finally see a psychiatrist this week. I have the same fears about SFI. I know it's not that because if I self medicate it goes away and I manage to sleep at least some. Benadryl and zzzquil don't quiet the part of my mind keeping me awake (presumably the amygdala) which pretty much proves that it's anxiety and hyperarousal/hyperawareness. Not uncommon, but for people with highly sensitive amygdalas we can fight our normal bodily processes very strongly. It's a horrible conflict. I wish you tbe best and definitely recommend seeing a psychiatrist. Primary care can help you also, but they don't always get the mental aspects of it."

insomnia,fgtv66z,t1_fgsap9z,1581109755.0,Same. Even when I crash it's still pathetic sleep. The hypnic jerks are torture.
insomnia,fgtukpo,t3_f0d0p4,1581109609.0,"I have two kids, a one year old and a 5 year old. It's not easy. It messes with you mentally, too. Some things I try to tell myself to help me feel a little bit better about it is that they're not going to remember me being tired all the time, or anxious, or depressed, or whatever I'm feeling on the inside. They'll remember me being there, and loving them. I can't play with them much because I'm often running on no sleep whatsoever, but the important thing is that I am there and I love them to death."
