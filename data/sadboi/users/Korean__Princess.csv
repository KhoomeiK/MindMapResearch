EatingDisorders,fpw1tcj,t1_fpr1xrd,1588955777.0,">I felt disappointed with myself

You shouldn't be. CICO is terrible for longer term, sustained weight loss. Essentially your body adapts, starts to use less energy to sustain itself, and guess what happens.. You gain weight back and you're back to square one. You probably end up being cold and have less energy and such as well, which makes you feel worse too. And just losing weight to lose weight and going back to your old ways is counterproductive as well. 

You should work on improving your metabolic health, reversing insulin resistance. Eat whole foods, preferably go low carb, do some sort of intermittent fasting. You can do more but this is a good way to get your foot in the door at least before delving deeper if you want to optimize you path towards health. 

This won't be a quick fix either, but it can be sustainable which is the main goal here.. 

Sorry for the long post/rant, but I feel bad for people who do CICO and then blame themselves when it's not really their fault, just lack of knowledge and applying wrong, painful methods to lose weight.."
