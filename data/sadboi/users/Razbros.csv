mentalhealth,fo7kpzu,t3_g65wx8,1587579986.0,"my family members shamed using the health services made accessible by the government and healthcare system. so now i sit and suffer without any help, as to “not be one of those people”. i get you in a sense. these people project their own opinions and have no idea what effect it has on you. plus, NOBODY should be allowed to make your choices for you, or take your’s away."
mentalhealth,fo3q4x8,t3_g5ir1i,1587491119.0,"please please please don’t continue down the road of self destructing, it doesn’t end well. and withdrawing hoping that your friends will help you/check in on you. they won’t. the only thing you need to do is learn to rely on yourself, you can’t rely on anyone else to have your back."
mentalhealth,fndyuuu,t3_fqib8w,1586880027.0,"Thank you so much. You have no idea how much of an angel you are to those of us who don’t get offers of support often. And, I’ve had such a hard time getting help because of my gender, you have no idea. Some MH professionals have taken their past trauma out on me (bc of my gender i think?), and it’s completely turned me off getting professional help despite my deteriorating stability. I also have always felt like being called an ‘attention seeker’ by talking about how i feel? 

I was self isolating for months before COVID-19. All of my friends dropped off and stopped checking in on me, as soon as they stopped seeing anything of me. I got forgotten by the world, and I haven’t had a text from anybody in months. I got all this unresolved trauma that I never got the help I needed, and i’m beating myself up with. Constant anxiety attacks, flashbacks, nightmares where i wake up screaming. Sometimes I don’t eat or sleep for days because i CAN’T. Just thank you again, I needed this positive message and offer of support. You really made my day."
