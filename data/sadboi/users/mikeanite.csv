There is Gov't assistance like welfare, food programs, even housing you guys should take advantage of. The gov't assistant money might not be a lot but enough to get me by with cheap meals. It might not be high standard but it feeds me.

Healthcare cost is high? There is ""Medicaid"" to assist. That's why the United States is implementing healthcare for all. You guys shouldn't be getting sick if you guys are sanitized.

There are a lot of programs out there to get people back on their feet. If you guys go to the unemployment help center there's help there too."
