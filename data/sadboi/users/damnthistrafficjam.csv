About 18 years ago my husband and I were in a position where we had to obtain a medication for our daughter which cost $3,000 a month at the time. We had 3 kids, I worked less than part time, and my husband made about 40k a year. The insurance which was already a huge amount, came with a $7,000 deductible for the year. She started it in October, and then the deductible paid went right back to zero in January. So over the course of 6 months, we were in the hole for $14,000. 

At that point we turned to the manufacturer of the drug to see about their patience assistance, which they made a really big deal about. I can‚Äôt remember exact figures, but my husband would have had to earn at the levels of public assistance (about 22k for a family of 5)to be eligible.
