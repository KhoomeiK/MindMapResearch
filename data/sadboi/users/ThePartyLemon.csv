One of the big reasons this things gotten as far as it has is because of dangerous lines of thinking like this. People can and are dealing with being restricted to their home. There are other countries where people cant leave their home and those people are just fine. If you let people leave their homes for anything less than an emergency, you cant hope to contain things like the virus. We would have this thing close to wrapped up if everyone possible was restricted to their house for a few weeks."

That means not only closed businesses, but everyone who isnt essential staying home and not leaving for any reason other than an emergency. Social distancing is a cop out to be able to not force people to stay home. Social distancing, staying just 6 feet apart, doesnt work this far into the outbreak. I'm sitting outside my work right now watching the same amount of people out and about as if it were a normal day. Unless forced, not many people will actually stay home like they should."

depression,fd61hqn,t3_ejsoej,1578184230.0,"I like to say that a person burdened by depression is like a person on fire, with each person around them holding a pale of water. Each person with a pale has the power to put out the fire yet keeps the pale to themselves for whatever reason they say, then when the fire grows too hot and the one who bares the fire isnt able to take it anymore, they want to put the fire out themselves once and for all. Those around them would fight tooth and nail for the warmth the fire provides regardless of how much it burns the person holding it. The worst thought of all is that once the fire is out with nobody to keep it lit, those who liked the warmth will move on to different warmth, publicly wondering why they couldn't have the warmth they had before."

AskReddit,ez2anoy,t3_czr7lx,1567654010.0,"That you can't afford the cost of living doesnt mean you are lazy or need to get a better job. I see it a lot. On any discussion about the cost of living. There will be plenty of people who will swear by the argument that the reason someone cant afford the cost of living is because they wont get a better job. All I see is ""get a better/higher paying job"" when the whole point is that the majority of people cant get better jobs due to one thing or the other. They constantly ignore the fact that most jobs that pay above minimum wage require multiple years of expensive schooling and multiple years of experience. When you point this out, they bring out the ""trade job/join the military"" argument. This doesnt work either because both of those have high physical requirements that not everyone can meet and the military is a strict, 100 percent involvement lifestyle that leaves little for life outside the military until at least a year or 2 later. I cant afford to live on my own in the town I grew up in because the rent is so damn high. I cant afford it not because I wont get a better job, it's because I CANT."
