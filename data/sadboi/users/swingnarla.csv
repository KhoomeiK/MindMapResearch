Therefore for:1- they cannot take it on board
2- they cannot do any of the above
3-they cannot weigh up and decide
4-they can do it all
5-they can do it all but with help. You must do everything you can to provide help e.g. pictures, interpreters. If the help works, they have capacity so yes they can.

Other: Capacity is assessed based on a specific decision e.g. surgery. Someone may have capacity to decide whether to take painkillers or what to eat for breakfast but may lack capacity to consent to surgery for example. This can fluctuate over the course of the day and there may be times in the day they have the capacity to do the 4 requirements and you should wait if possible.

You cannot say someone 'lacks capacity' in general as a broad stroke to cover anything because it just doesn't make sense as it has be based on a decision."

Study something if you enjoy it/research but there are easier ways to get points - namely being a teacher and presentations. For other easy points there is commitment to specialty so join the relevant royal college and attend a conference. You will do audits and presentations easily during foundation (mandatory to do one audit a year anyway). If you struggled to get a post then you could use that year then to locum while doing masters and getting all the points if needed!

BipolarReddit,fod5spo,t3_g6lk8x,1587680371.0,"Worked in psychiatry and am a patient! I've had a good experience. Initially depression for years but after an episode which led to actual consequences, my friend and I discussed how we can approach this with my GP. So my friend wrote a letter (also a doctor) which outlined what she saw as an outsider in factual terms of what happened. My GP referred immediately and I got diagnosed and medicated better. I cannot complain about any form of care. I've not required NHS therapy etc as I didn't have a complex history - I used university, charity then private counselling. 

I'd like to believe my good care was as a result of good people and services. However, I know the system thoroughly such that I was able to advocate for myself.

I know from the other side that everyone is doing what they can but mental health's funding is cut first. The people who go into this area usually have their own personal story and want to help. Unfortunately, that doesn't always come across and people get stuck in the bureaucratic side until they are too ill and require much more help and time to get better. 

Personally, I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me when I thought I couldn't be helped."

JuniorDoctorsUK,fn80w04,t3_g03ztp,1586731587.0,"Call them what they introduce themselves as! First names for most except consultants, unless they really insist on first names. There's been a push to be less hierarchical within doctors. I've only ever called registrars by their first names. 

Nurses are all first names. If you can't remember, you can ask for the 'nurse in charge' if you want the chief. Or if you want the nurse looking after the bay, I would go and ask someone 'who is the nurse looking after this bay?' There's a lot of nurse supporting roles, so impossible to know who is who anyway. Just don't call out 'nurse!' whatever you do. Sisters is old school as there's lots of male nurses - nurse in charge or nurse is fine.

Edit: looking at other answers, it appears to be variable. Variance on sisters/matron/nurse in charge but noone would raise an eyebrow if you used the 'wrong' one.You are safe in doctors being first name except consultants/GPs. And nurses being first names.

She genuinely can do the social stuff and the physical stuff. Lots of doctors have disabilities and many more will acquire one during service to the NHS. 

I understand that you may imagine her colleagues are annoyed but would you be surprised if I said they weren't? Some doctors work part time, others can't work night shifts, some can't be in procedures with risk of needle stick injuries. If it puts too much work on the colleagues, they bring in locums. Furthermore, as part of the equality act, an employer must put reasonable adjustments in place  to enable an enployee to work safely. If it was not feasible (practically, financially etc) to do so and therefore she would not be safe, she would not be practicing. Simple as. Clearly this is not the case. Nor should we pretend to know the ins and outs of her disability, what she needs and what she can do.

We have occupational health which met with me and immediately said I'm clearly no risk and here's how we can help prevent any crises. I'm stable except depression episodes and I've never been hospitalised etc so it was easier to determine no risk.

Being a healthcare professional with bipolar has so many strengths but we have to be more diligent and vigilant than others with bipolar. We take on others burdens and we need to be our best to do so safely. Never skip meds, always comply. For better or worse.

JuniorDoctorsUK,exc2aul,t3_crrctg,1566142324.0,"Thank you everyone. Nice to know I'm not alone!

Today started off bad with an arrest in a young pt and I was the only doctor on the ward (consultant not coming till midday and reg off to resus). Luckily all the nursing staff are ALS trained so I called the consultant myself and told him to come in now (matron had been regularly calling telling him the pt is getting worse the 30mins before). ROSCd again but they've since mostly died- it was an unsurvivable injury.

So it seems people know that I felt I had a bad day yesterday. At the night handover, I was avoiding eye contact trying not to cry and I was blunt and said it was a bad day and they're like was it that bad though? And just simply went yep. So now other staff (matron, random nurses) have been asking me if they can help me etc which is good but it's too much, I'm quite private and I had just hoped to have a quite word with a senior. some nurses are like 'yep what do you expect, that's ICU' and in my mind they probably don't respect me now, even though I have no proof of that. At the handover this morning, the core trainee 2 on my rota stays behind comes onto the unit and is like 'how's it going, you're doing really well, I didn't know you were an F1 till someone said' and I'm like yep yep yep, again trying to not to cry cos it won't help. I did then cry but like turned to the computer and just did a silent one and I haven't cried in months. Nice of her to approach me though and I appreciated it cos I know I can talk to her now if needed.

But on the bright side, today's consultant called me aside got me a pastry and a tea and he was like 'talk to me' turns out he's also the clinical director. He initially was giving me the whole 'yeah ICU is hard, in my day I was having to do this'. 

So I became specific about what I was struggling with: 'i'm making decisions above my level' and 'no senior support which is weird because during induction everyone was saying you'll never be alone on the unit and always someone to help' and 'a consultant told me that if I'm doing a bad job they won't tell me because they don't have time to look over me and instead will ignore my input (my clin supervisor)' and 'another consultant said they expect me to be at the same level and do the same jobs as the others on my rota' who are ICU clinical fellows. Got a better discussion from that and he gave me his email and mobile number and told me that if anything happens, I can message and email. And that he's going to raise at the next consultant meeting how the consultants need to be aware that not everyone is at the same training level and if on call with a junior, more help and support is needed with jobs. So I'm happy with that.

I'm embarrassed about the whole thing because I thought I could do a keep calm, carry on and now I feel I've made a fuss over not much. I really hate crying in front of people as well (even worse when it's your consultant and you've only known them a few days). 

Next week I've used some annual leave cos family visiting so I've only got night shifts Weds and Thurs which are less bad.

I would still offer it to all high risk patients and follow best practice but I don't believe it should be given out as casually as it is. Personally I wouldn't take it myself. I think it should be up to a patient to decide with all the information. In an ideal world, lifestyle would be trialled first but not realistic.
