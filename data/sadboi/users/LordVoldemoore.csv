HPfanfiction,fr05axb,t1_fr00rqk,1589784189.0,"Very true. I'm glad he isn't too OOC then! I definitely understand a Draco who's matured believably, it's just those fics where it's like a completely different person with Draco's name (and not far enough in the future for enough time to rationalise a huge shift). I might give this story a go though!

No you didn't üòÜ but I also forget the name!

Yessssssss, let me know how you find Paradox! So good.

A Dangerous Game was definitely like a gateway story for me, hahaha. I was generally only mainly into reading Draco/Hermione or Harry/Hermione stuff, but I just loved the somewhat dark vibe/humour/general writing of this that I ended up liking Tom Riddle, haha. REALLY hard to find another Tom written like this though, sadly. Again, I hate when he's too soft (or too morbid) üòÇ"
HPfanfiction,fqzyvob,t1_fqzvclb,1589778939.0,"I reeeaally need to give Rationality another shot! I always make it quite a bit through - I remember loving that bit in Quirrell's classroom when he made it outer space for example - but never getting pulled in deep enough! (Or having enough hours at one time)

Ooooh, I wanted to give Rebuilding a go, but a couple reviews mentioned Draco being v OOC which made me hesitant.

Is that the Veela story where Hermione is a different kind of Veela that doesn't come with the normal amazing looks/allure? I vaguely remember something like that... She was this second type of Veela that couldn't live without her mate from memory!

Have you read Paradox by Olivieblake? I think that's my favourite Dramione that's not, like, Isolation/Bex-Chan-popular

I'm going to look up that Brilliant Magic story! I don't mind some smut, haha. I dunno if you've ever been a fan of teenage Tom Riddle stuff, but there's a hella underrated story by Cybrid called A Dangerous Game. Just a believable characterisation for me (perhaps not for some others I'm sure) and fun to read üòÇ"
HPfanfiction,fqztwg4,t1_fqzsot1,1589775287.0,"Aw, yay!! My favourite is actually probably a tie between Prince of the Dark Kingdom and To the Waters and the Wild. Both abandoned, mind you. As for a Dark Horse - probably a couple looking through my favourites. What ships do you like, if any? And what settings? I feel like Blood Crest by Cauchy is pretty underrated (no ships) but it still has 1k reviews, so maybe not as underrated as I thought üòÜ

And what would your favourites and Dark Horse be?"

MadeMeSmile,fqp9pi1,t1_forjvbd,1589539982.0,Practise!!! I'd say join as many random Zoom parties/events you can and make yourself a goal to speak up and eventually you'll be used to it enough to not be nervous on your own calls! (I had this with auditions/presentations until I got enough practice)

Ugh, the year 7 thing is awful. Like I said, being 11 in a school where some of the students were 18-19 would have felt really intimidating. It felt intimidating enough having homeroom as one of three 12 years olds with all the older levels. (Dunno if schools still do mixed level homeroom). But even if it's not mixed homeroom anymore, I'd still have hated it. And the ""peer support""/""buddy"" system they had pairing us with older students didn't help at all, hahaha."

Adelaide,fl384dl,t1_fl247hr,1584772313.0,"I cannot let this comment slide haha. So, vitamin D is produced in the skin with the help of UVB sunlight, which, due to the shape of these shorter rays, peaks when the sun is closest to the earth - midday. That's why just 8-10 minutes of unprotected sun at midday is perfect for vitamin D for light to medium skinned people. At all other far-off times of the day, you are being silently damaged by dangerous long-range UVA rays (silently because these rays cause severe damage but do not cause notable sunburn) and receiving negligible UVB here. (This is why countries and states closer to the equator have better D and tan easier - greater UVB availability with a closer sun)"
