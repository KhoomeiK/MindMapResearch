When Fascism was born, it was something really different from what it  becomes later (their ""manifesto"" of 1919 has nothing to do with the shit they do to our country during the dictatorship).Said this, now it's since 2008 we don't have a parliament democratically elected: EU always suggests a kind of ""technical""government who drain resources from people, killing this country in the name of financial equilibrium. It's something which opens the doors to extremist movement in the long period unfortunately. We don't have anymore a real left party, everything is corrupted.
