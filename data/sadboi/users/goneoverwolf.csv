SuperMorbidlyObese,fq7rzso,t3_ggp9am,1589151008.0,"I read this today and it resonated so deep with me and it could help change the mindset 
""Just move on.
Stop dwelling, stop missing the days when you ate with reckless abandon, stop lamenting a second bowl of ice cream, stop begrudging the present moment, and move forward with your life. Eating, though it seems like the most important thing in the world, is not. Food, though one of the purest forms of pleasure and fun and reward, is just sustenance. Think about your relationships and goals and other parts of your life that bring you satisfaction. If you focus on the food, the food will take over your life and you will miss out on so much more. Life is more than a great meal plan. Think about what could happen if you shifted all of your energy from food onto other parts of your life""

While you would prefer you handle the situation differently there is nothing you can do now but move forward and make better choices that you wont regret. The only person you can control is yourself and you can do that right now. Also be honest to yourself about the situation dont exaggerate the negatives or downplay any roll you may have had (not that you deserve blame just so you can see the situation clearly) Try to he forgiving to yourself as well.

My aunt wasn't there only me and my cousin but she showed up while they were there. They asked her about her bf and she said she broke up with him a while ago had nothing to do with him ext. Well almost immediately after he nocked on the door and the cop asked is this your boyfriend? she said yes because you could tell she was caught. but she went off on him telling him she didnt want to see him again and they let him leave. She got back with him after the police left obviously. She lost custody of her kids over it so they knew she was irresponsible but still he got no time. To top it all off she went to my cousin's funeral. My point is the police knew I dont know why they did nothing. If I were to explain everything it would be alot of reading.

I reported her to dhs because i had to move out and couldn't keep her daughter safe. My cousin lied and said he called dhs on her after her kids were taken and we moved out together. She later reported that my cousin was the one molesting her daughter and he went to jail for it Her boyfriend got no jail time though since they had a scapegoat. He got out of jail late 2019 and killed himself in september. If i never moved in with her, if i had admited to calling, He might be here now."
