Also, I suppose it depends who you are to them. Therapist? Stranger? It SHOULD be them, and we hopefully only step in on someone's behalf when we are certain they can't decide for themselves.
Sometimes we think that is necessary when it isn't, because we talk about mental illnesses rather than mental differences."

Tethering them back to reality is safer and kinder than making them dependent on you for something you're only providing momentarily to be nice and fill a need. They absolutely should be able to detach their experience from ANY outside input, bc while they may be in excruciating pain, who the heck knows what those around them have been through, what pov they're speaking from. That's them living their own life. Depressed, anxious or not. (I've personally carried both for 31 years.) They may not appear capable of taking care of themselves in that way, from your perspective, but we all deserve the chance to prove to ourselves that we can. Struggling people often benefit more from our faith that they can handle the truth, take care of themselves, ask for help when they need it, make their own decisions, etc."

I hope you shared your question and your mission, because you're stubborn, too. I'm still learning about being a starseed and how it might relate to my mental 'differences'. What I can say is that even IF the field of psychology could be trusted, it still wouldnt have us all figured out. I hope you take the help that helps, but trust your intuition above all else, love."
