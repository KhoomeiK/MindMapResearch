If you prefer a straight monogamous relationship, or a lesbian poly one, it's ok. None of this people is saying otherwise, they say they feel happier being in a monogamous one and that they couldn't be in a poly one, they are not attacking or judging or saying one way is more valid than the other. Of course they'll feel their way to love is more special, because they are living it! Because their experience made them feel that way. We all want to be loved and feel happy and special. That has nothing to do with cognitive dissonance, or thinking. Again, let people be. Why do they have to justify themselves?! Preferences are NOT opinions. There's one comment that says it ""disgusts"" him/her, in that case he/she is judging and attacking, absolutely yes. Just don't generalize."

Subscribe to r/Italy and when you have a little more knowledge, try to read/write something there.

If you can, you should buy a grammar book or download one.

You have to be constant and you must be the one that motivates yourself. Learning a language id never useless because knowledge only adds, it never takes. You'll learn another way of view the world.

Good luck!"
