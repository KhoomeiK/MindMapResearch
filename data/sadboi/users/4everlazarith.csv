stimuluscheck,fowrd5y,t3_g8zcmo,1588125521.0,"Filed 2019 taxes on April 15th, owed in 2018, hadn't paid that off. Got ""payment status not available"" until 4/23, same day my taxes were processed (and scheduled to receive refund on 04/29). Was able to input DD info. on 4/23 and got the ""your payment will be deposited into the account below"" message with no date. Checked back on 4/27 and got ""we have scheduled your check to be mailed on May 01, 2020"". Irritating, but happy to have solid (?) info. In Oregon, will update when I receive my check."

stimuluscheck,foot6uy,t3_g8nvf3,1587945939.0,"I was finally able to input my DD info on 4/23 after being stuck on ""payment status not available"" since 4/15. Filed with H&R block on 4/15 (a bit late, I know) with below $10k AGI. Now, whenever I check back I'm getting locked out for 24hrs. Anyone have any ideas when people who entered DD info on 4/23 and beyond will get a date/payment?"
Humanoidencounters,foe1mtj,t3_g42a88,1587694265.0,"I think I saw one of these in Goldendale, WA late one night. I was sitting on the stoop of my back door smoking a cigarette at about 3 o‚Äô clock in the morning, and saw something walking on all fours in the grass. At first I thought it was a deer, so I disregarded it. Then, it slowly walked up to the security light in the grass and I looked over and was completely disturbed by what I saw. It was a flesh colored creature shaped like a scrawny, slightly disfigured human, and as it turned and looked at me I saw it had a face like a dog but also like a human? Sorry, it‚Äôs very hard to describe. Also flesh colored though. When it looked away I saw that it‚Äôs eyes were like a cats, in that they‚Äôd shine in the dark. I went back inside right after it looked at me and didn‚Äôt go to sleep that night."
