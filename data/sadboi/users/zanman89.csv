StarWarsLeaks,ey7oeif,t1_ey6vl1y,1566892429.0,"The movie clarified things. Kylo's saying this as someone who has not yet fully developed as a character ('cause he has one more movie)-- he still believes that the only way to move forward is to forget or destroy the past, but his confrontation with Luke and the moment with Han's dice at the end shows that the past is an integral part of who he is, and he can't escape it. Similarly, Luke can't ignore his past; he thinks the world needs to forget the Jedi, but he doesn't realize that his status of a hero is part of him and part of the resistance.

""Let the past die"" is pretty much the opposite of the real message of the movie. You can't kill the past. If you try, it's only going to haunt you."
