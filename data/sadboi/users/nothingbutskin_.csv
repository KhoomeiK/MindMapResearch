SuicideWatch,f7m281x,t3_dww2tw,1573852959.0,"I don't believe in afterlife. I believe our life and conscious is just the result of chemical combinations and electric connections in our brain, and when it stops being fed it just rots and everything you've ever thought or felt dies with it. It's all phisical. Some may say this sounds sad or scary but i find some relief in it. Knowing that when i die i will just be gone and i won't have to think about anything, feel anything. it's calming. Life is already dense enough."
SuicideWatch,f6ydp9s,t1_f6ufhi2,1573275897.0,I know probably nothing i say will help if you're feeling the same way i am but i hope it gets better man. I don't wish these feelings to anyone and it's sucks that there's so many of us so deep in shit. I also hope you're strong enough to at least get help. gl
SuicideWatch,f6ydksk,t1_f6t2jdr,1573275763.0,"Well I've never been to a psychologist and I don't even know where to start to do so, or if i can afford it. 
And i said i had plans because i actually had them and i needed to let it out before carrying them out, i just wasn't able to. But yeah I'll try to ease the intense urge to find a propper way, thanks"
SuicideWatch,f6sun7d,t1_f6qnyxi,1573140000.0,"Well i said friend cause I'm used to call them that term but yeah they're straight up trash and just confirmed they don't give a single shit about me so just another reason to add to the list.
Also I wish i wanted to do it just because they told me but that's not the case, it's just that right now anything can make me crumble. I guess i was just being impulsive and angry when writing that."
SuicideWatch,f6su6oa,t1_f6rdp66,1573139816.0,"I'm not doing cause they tell me but because the fact that they told me just erased the last bit of hope i had of them caring about me, so another reason to add. 
And yeah i say friend because I'm used to that term but they're nothing like that anymore."
SuicideWatch,f6stx0p,t1_f6r8up0,1573139705.0,"I care, somehow, as I'm feeling so numb i can't really tell. 
I feel the same way as you and i wish i could give you advice on how to feel better, but I don't know either. I hope whatever shit you're going through eases a lil at least."
SuicideWatch,f6stneo,t1_f6qkjii,1573139600.0,"Thank you for caring, i ended up not being strong enough to even get up and get the pills but for now I'm not feeling glad i didn't. I wish i was just being impulsive but I've been having severe suicidal thoughts for a month now and the only reason i don't fulfill them is because I don't have the media or the guts. A part of me hopes they disappear because i don't want to hurt anyone but they just won't go."
SuicideWatch,f6st6rw,t1_f6rlc80,1573139420.0,"I don't really get what you mean. That post was very short and open so it might lead to conclusions.
Also, having desires or urges to do something in life does not mean you still want to live. You may want to do so many things but be so incapable and exhausted you think it's not worth it anymore. Suicidal thoughts are that scary, knowing that someday you'll take your own life one day and with it all your dreams will disappear but you don't even care."
SuicideWatch,f6qlev1,t1_f6qkq83,1573079896.0,"Oh that's so sweet hahaha thank you
U made me smile a bit :)"
SuicideWatch,f6qjfpw,t3_ds4ila,1573078611.0,"Every single night since god know when. My chest has been doing weird things and I've been drinking alcohol and taking sleeping pills (in the normal amount) just to see if it helps and I don't ever wake up. It's terrifying and peaceful at the same time. 
I wish i could give you advice on how to feel better but i can't even advice myself, so I'm sorry."
SuicideWatch,f6qj32c,t1_f6qdypt,1573078389.0,"I call them my friends from my point of view but they stopped seeing me that way long ago. I sadly know it for a fact, through conversations someone showed me, that they hate me. I'm spending time with them because there was a plan made in my house and i was obviously invited by chain. It sucks but well at least I'm not alone even though it's bad company for them."
SuicideWatch,f6qiurf,t1_f6qiish,1573078243.0,"No, i call them my friends because i still care about me but they don't see me as a friend anymore. It would be so awkward. And this is not paranoia because I've seen conversations of them saying they hate me. So yeah, i appreciate the advice and i would love to hug them but it'd just be worse."
SuicideWatch,f6kp1dw,t1_f6ko4tm,1572917188.0,"Hello, I'm glad we can find things in common, it sometimes helps to keep our feet in the ground and reduce that feeling of loneliness. I also don't think it's shameful to visit a professional but it's just so hard for me to talk about these issues in real life and I'm scared of the results if i do. 

Also thank you for caring, a part of me is trying so hard to get help but it's so difficult and exhausting, I'm proud i was brave enough to just post that and I'm glad i did because i never thought being listened would be good for me. I'll definetely keep trying because i have nothing else to do.

I hope you can go through it as well, if you ever need a talk I'm here even tho i don't know you lmao and i'm kinda bad at advice, but well. Hope it helps"
SuicideWatch,f6ko41y,t1_f6knbji,1572916519.0,"I don't think i can get myself to see a doctor, and i'm just trying so hard to find something to hold on to so i don't disappoint anyone but there's nothing. It's exhausting.

I hope you find something that motivates you and i wish i could give you some advice."
SuicideWatch,f6kl88o,t1_f6i0w48,1572914391.0,"This hit home... I feel like i'm not capable of being happy anymore, when i always used to find some hope no matter how small it was when i was younger. I only wish i could go back and i definetely don't want to keep going forward."
SuicideWatch,f6kk5ao,t3_drfgcp,1572913728.0,"1. I've lost interest in tring to feel better 
2. i just want to end this cycle of fake hope and then agony again
3. I don't have determination for anything anymore
4. The only thing keeping me alive is my family, apart from that there's nothing holding me
5. I know i will always struggle and i'm exhausted already, i want to avoid pain and just rest
6. Apart from pain in my family, i won't leave anything else. Nothing special of me will be missed
7. My friend tells me to get help but that would make me even more exhausted because just writing this is so tiring
8. I don't see myself in the future. In any form, i just don't plan on living on
9. I simply feel like i'm not made to keep living anymore and i will never have any genuine will to live again. I want to stop existing"
