LegalAdviceUK,fknc3vn,t3_fjjfeh,1584361573.0,"So technically you can request a refund, but it won’t be granted. 

The main reason universities have suspended face to face teaching right now when the government haven’t forced them to is to allow students to return home. With flights being cancelled and borders closing, it would be unfair to continue face to face teaching and in-person exams to the detriment of students who are from elsewhere. 

You will still have access to most of your universities resources, and classes and materials will be conducted online, as well as exams. Most universities do not expressly state that all classes will be delivered in person, face to face. They also retain the right to change term dates under certain circumstances, which I believe this would fall under.

It’s unfortunate that the strikes and the virus have coincided, but neither of those are within the universities’ control. The universities have opted to do what’s best for their students and faculty at this time."

relationship_advice,fk5v9dp,t1_fk5t4q2,1583888529.0,"I don’t consider having regular sex an addiction, as addiction is generally defined by the negative impact it has on the addicts life. Sex addiction is 100% real but it’s very different from having regular sex. I’m also not looking to be validated, having sex releases the feel-good brain chemicals and it is nice to share a physical and emotional moment with another person.

Staying ‘pure’ so that I’m not judged because someone else has touched my genitals with their genitals seems much more like seeking validation to me.

I think sex is necessary for a healthy relationship. It’s not everything and there will no doubt be those who are happy to go without but a lack of sexual compatibility is a major reason for relationship breakdowns

I think where we differ is that I don’t feel like sex is ‘giving up’ your body."

The fatigue and brain fog is a curse. I won’t lie to you it can be really hard to achieve academically with all that going on. What worked for me is accepting that it’s something I’ve got to live with and adapting the way I study/work. I’d start projects way in advance and only study for a couple hours at a time a couple of times a day. Plenty breaks, fuel your body with good food, and take care of yourself. 

As for relationships it can be really difficult dealing with people who don’t understand what it’s like to look fine but feel like shit every single day. I’d recommend online support groups and the like for autoimmune diseases, people are really helpful and there’s lots of good advice out there."

This doesn’t excuse malicious things obviously, more the wording and how things may be interpreted. Like when OP said “I can’t tell” which was taken to be a further attack on his size when she was really referring to his body language and demeanour.

Also if you’re getting ready to bump uglies with someone for the first time, you best be prepared for ANYTHING. Peoples genitals vary a lot in appearance and people remember hurtful things that are said. 

Yes, it’s mortifying. Yes, you probably really hurt his feelings. But you’ve given him a sincere apology and you should give yourself permission to forget about it."

TrueOffMyChest,fi9mvml,t1_fi9m8xw,1582272317.0,"Sex is about more than just orgasms for many people. If it was only about orgasms people would just masturbate and save themselves the hassle. 

I agree that how you perform does have some impact but performing doesn’t mean having a big dick and a high body count. Being interested and open to what makes her feel good is much more important. 

Women that lay back and expect the man to do all of the work are not worth your time dude. It’s an unhealthy attitude to have towards sex and I know it’s not your fault because that’s what society seems to force down our throats but no one is having good sex with that mindset."
TrueOffMyChest,fi9lz9q,t3_f77gtp,1582271175.0,"First of all the chances of her having mind blowing sex any more than a couple of times are incredibly slim. The majority of women have a hard time orgasming and the communication necessary to achieve orgasm usually just isn’t there when it comes to hook-ups and one night stands. 

Dick size doesn’t matter as much as you think it does as again most women won’t orgasm from penetration alone. If you think you are bad in bed then be open and willing to learn and listen to what they need. No girl is going to be put off by a man wanting to make them orgasm. 

You need to stop thinking of sex as this expectation on you to perform and if the girl makes you feel that way then she’s not the one for you. 

Also bragging about hookups is gross and you should ignore your friends/colleagues. Quality over quantity is the key when it comes to sex."
unpopularopinion,fi8jg9i,t1_fi8hwxm,1582241659.0,"I agree in that I don’t really think that it’s a case of “sane” or “insane.” There’s a lot in between 100% mentally sound and the few specific diagnosed medical conditions that we refer to as insane. 

I think it’s more about examining what ‘evil’ actually means and considering the circumstances of the person in question as there’s definitely many factors that come into it. 

If you murder a person for enjoyment then you would definitely be considered insane but if you murder your husband for life insurance then you’ve exercised some really poor judgement and selfishness. 

I think you can be a total piece of shit but there’s always some reason behind it. However, that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be accountable for their actions or forgiven even."

unpopularopinion,fi8ge2l,t3_f70xw7,1582239829.0,"I think it’s a fair point. A person who commits an extremely violent crime, such as stabbing someone 50+ times is surely not of sound mind by default, since a sane and reasonable person of sound mind would not stab another person 50+ times.

If someone ends up pregnant and after weighing up all of their options, chooses to keep the baby and works hard to give that baby a good life then yeah, it is pretty admirable.

I think bad moms shouldn’t be praised but I don’t think being young makes you a bad mom by default.

It seems like financial stability is the biggest factor that makes you seem to think young mom = bad mom, which is understandable to an extent but you can’t just force everyone that earns below X amount to have an abortion. Especially considering that most young pregnancies are not planned. Often contraception fails and sometimes people don’t have a choice in the matter. 

I have to say I’ve never personally seen teen moms receiving much more praise than your average pregnant woman though. I also don’t imagine that 16/17 year old girls are getting pregnant on purpose for all the praise they’ll get."

Women have a much harder time getting off than men and talking about intimacy issues or difficulties in the bedroom to find out what’s ‘normal’ or to come up with solutions with their close female friends isn’t always a bad thing.

NeckbeardNests,ffs10e5,t3_etnlzu,1580170512.0,"So I’m a pretty tidy person, but there’s been a few times where my depression has gotten on top of me or my physical health has been too bad to clean and the mess has piled up and then it got to a point that the mess was so overwhelming to even attempt to do anything about it.  

I’ve managed to overcome that by writing a list of things that I need to do daily, weekly, and monthly.  Daily - open curtains, make bed, tidy everything up from the floor, wardrobe and desk. Weekly - vacuum/sweep, dust, clean mirrors/windows, wash clothes and bedding. Monthly - clean inside wardrobe and other storage, deep clean the furniture, floor and walls, sort through any clutter, etc.  

I find that a checklist breaks everything down into small, easier to manage tasks which is necessary for me when I’m dealing with depression. This could also be helpful since you share a room, your younger sister could help out with things on the list."
