AskWomen,foejzvm,t1_foehi51,1587705787.0,"The reason some people can have panic attacks when they are excited is because it triggers the same mechanism as fear...the fight or flight response due to an increase in adrenaline. The book, Dare, by Barry McDonagh goes in great detail about it. I recommend it for any anxiety sufferer. The book explains the importance of telling your mind (when you feel anxiety kicking in) that you are actually excited, since the brain can't actually tell the difference between the two. By telling yourself you are excited everytime you experience anxiety, it diffuses the anxiety. There are a few other easy steps to follow in the process, but it's actually quite effective when a person commits to doing it.

Edit: Thank you for my first ever awards! That was quite generous, and I appreciate it!"

AskReddit,fmva8eu,t3_fxjqxa,1586410400.0,"I used to work as an early preschool teacher assistant in my late teens. One day I was watching the kids in the afternoon waiting for parent pickup. One of the little boys was the son of the supervisor of our daycare. One afternoon I watched him tie a play kitchen apron on and proceed to set up an entire kitchen. He painstakingly set up every pot and pan, toy plates, bowls, cups and silverware on the play kitchen in the room. I was watching another child as he was finishing setting up the kitchen. I turned back in time to see the boy shove everything off the counters with his arm and then cover his ears and start screaming ""no daddy, don't hit mommy! No daddy!"" I went over to ask him if he was okay and he calmly looked at me and said yes, and then asked if he could do it all again. I knew something was seriously wrong, and I should have said something to someone, but my supervisor was his mom, and I was a dumb kid who was not trained in the horrors some kids experience. I told myself that if it happened again, I would say something. I never did witness it again, but that has stuck with me for almost twenty years. 

Same daycare, different little boy. Creepiest kid I've ever encountered. Damien from Omen creepy. He was four and made us all uncomfortable. Not only did he tell his mother he was going to kill her on a fairly regular basis, but he also pushed one of the teachers down a flight of stairs and she broke her foot. He wasn't in my class ever, but he approached me once saying he remembered me babysitting him at his house, which wasn't true. The last thing I wanted was for this future serial killer to attribute my face to memories that had nothing to do with me. In my sternest voice I could muster I told that kid he was wrong, and it wasn't me he remembered. I've been looking over my shoulder all these years waiting for him to pop out from behind a tree."

Anxiety,fkeq52h,t3_eupik4,1584118369.0,"I think a big part of the worry right now is coming from the idea that we could be stuck in a quarantine, with no access to food. Seeing grocery stores emptying out right now just reinforces that fear.

Some things to think about though if a quarantine is happening or does happen in your area:

First off, it is only TEMPORARY. It WILL end at some point and life will return to normal. 

In China, even when people were in quarantine and were refused the option to leave their buildings, food was still being delivered. I have seen no credible news stories saying that people were left to starve. Many videos came out showing foreigners going to stores that still had supplies.

In Italy, though they are in quarantine, people are still allowed to go to the grocery store. And there have been no reports of food shortages. 

Also, it's important to remember that quarantines are set up to PREVENT the spread of the virus. They are not set up because the government thinks the whole town is lost and everyone is going to die. It's just to stop other towns near the epicenter from becoming epicenters themselves. It is in our government's best interest to keep us alive at all costs. We pay their wages after all, lol. 

Wherever you may be, try to open a window or step outside and feel the sun warming your skin, or rain drops on your face. Breath in the air and gaze at the stars at night. You should actively try to feel the outside world in one way or another to remind yourself that you are still alive, and the world is still moving. Even in Wuhan life was still happening when it got really bad. People were still getting food, government workers were out sanitizing surfaces. Staying closed up inside has a way of making us feel closed off from the world and all alone. So go open a window or go for a short walk if possible."

Your government cares about you guys. Now is a good time to delve into a hobby you've been ignoring or start a whole new one if available. Do some deep breathing and just know things will get better. It might just take a bit."
Anxiety,fk2tgtg,t1_fk2s492,1583808772.0,"I'm nervous too. There are many things we should have done proactively, and now unfortunately we will have to address the virus in a reactive manner. That puts us behind the curve.  But, there isn't anything that can be done about the past. The government is starting to ramp up on things to help people stay home and they are starting to test a lot more. Mitigation is now the focus. It's all about slowing the spread at this point. Local cities across the country have been taking matters into their own hands by cancelling events and closing schools.

One must wonder what could have been if we had stuck with the natural born bacteria destroyers instead of penicillin. I'm not arguing against the premise that penicillin was one of the best medical developments in its time, but it has put us in a bit of a quagmire now that it's helped spawn super bacteria. I'm very interested to see how the development of Bacteriophages goes, as they do seem promising."
