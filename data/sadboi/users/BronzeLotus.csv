Debt isn't much of an issue for us, we unfortunately do have 2 car payments but both are pretty low amounts and one of the cars will be paid off in less than 2 years. I didn't want two payments but we both had 20+ year old cars that unexpectedly kicked the bucket within a year of each other. Other than that we just have minimal credit card debt that I hope to pay off by the end of the year. Our biggest issue has been income. Mine has been decent since I started working in my industry but my husband has always struggled to earn a decent salary. He got a new job recently, hoping that once COVID has passed and he can go back to work he'll earn more money than he did previously. Also the rental market in our state is unreasonably expensive, but he has family here and I don't want to leave my employer so we deal with it."

It felt like my degree was totally useless but just having a degree of any sort has actually proved useful. Met my lovely husband at the age of 17, we've been together since we were 19. At the age of 23 I started working in the industry that I still work in to this day, I'm not with the company I started with but the one I work for is even better, they're a highly regarded employer in my city. I just got hired for a new position and I could honestly see it being a long-term career for me, maybe lifelong. We still struggle financially right now, but things are getting better.

careerguidance,fnffhr2,t3_g1f6tg,1586907054.0,"A lot of what you said reminded me of myself. I worked multiple jobs that involved sales but I was never a good saleswoman, even if I was great at the other parts of the job. I never enjoyed it. 

I accepted my final sales role with a purpose. I knew that the company believed strongly in hiring from within, so I worked my sales job long enough to get a non-sales role working in their HQ. I had to be patient, it took almost 3 years for me to get into my current job, but it was totally worth it. I worked in my current role for a year and found out I liked it better than sales but I still wasn't thrilled with it, so I applied for a different job and just got accepted for the position. I'm incredibly excited for my new job and I could see it potentially leading to a lifelong career path with this company. The three years of sales were worth it to get to this point. Just make sure, if you do this, that you research the company carefully so you know if it's the sort of place that you'd want to stay at for an extended amount of time.

Edit to add: I wanted to mention that I could have moved into a back-office job sooner but I was waiting for just the right opportunity, I didn't want to apply for many of the positions that opened up. In the final year that I worked my sales job I applied and interviewed for four jobs and got the fourth one, but I didn't apply for any jobs in the first two years. It might not take three years for you."

I didn't really want kids before I was with my husband, so I've had to adjust to this change to my identity and it's been difficult. I get what you mean about having those fears but feeling ready. That's what I'm working on reminding myself of. It's okay, normal even, to be afraid of such a major change. I'm the opposite of you, though, when it comes to the birth. I am absolutely terrified of having a C section. Horrified, petrified. I plan to have a natural birth in a birth center, I read that having an epidural makes you more likely to need a C section because you could lose too much sensation and not be able to push effectively. I'd rather feel all the pain of labor and birth than go through the process of recovering from the C section. But I know that I can't guarantee anything, my mom had C sections with all 4 of her kids so I know there is a chance it will happen to me. I'm trying to make my peace with that, but it's difficult."

One therapist told me that I needed to stop playing the victim, even though I rarely ever talk about my emotions with anyone (other than my husband) in real life so I'm not exactly hungry for attention. 

Also, my husband was diagnosed with BPD as a child. He manages it well with medication although he still has occasional suicidal feelings. He has had more than one provider question him and try to tell him he didn't have bipolar. Every time it's happened to him it has been on his first visit with that person. One literally walked into the room and immediately questioned his diagnosis without even talking to him. I have seen him when he's run out of one of his meds. He isn't faking."

How you used to be creative and good at writing but the depression killed it, struggling to pick a career and get started with school/wasting money on a major I didn't stick with for more than a semester, having trouble accepting my aging and feeling like I should have accomplished more by now, wishing I could go back in time, wondering who I would have become under different circumstances, fear of driving, everything you said about friends, and feeling like my SO is the only thing that's good in my life. Yet sometimes I even wish I had never met my SO and feel like my life would have been better without him, even though it probably would have been a lot worse. I feel so guilty for feeling how I feel because he has always been so kind and devoted to me.

It sucks. The world sucks. Money sucks. I feel your pain. I know that sometimes it is comforting just to know you're not the only one feeling the way you feel, so I offer you solidarity. The only advice I have is to try to do little things to give you a spark of contentment, even if it is brief. Is there anything you used to really enjoy that you have stopped doing? For example, I love metal music but I hardly listened to it for years because it makes my DH depressed. But recently I have been listening to metal with headphones, or in the car when he isn't around. It makes me feel more like my old, happier self, and brings me up for a little while. Maybe try something small and simple like that.

Also, I really recommend taking some trips on the freeway with your SO, if he will be patient and supportive. My family lives 2 hours away, all freeway driving, and for years my husband had to drive when we would visit them. One day he got a migraine while we were visiting, so I had to drive us home. I was so scared but having him with me was able to calm me down. And if your SO is with you, you can switch places if you get too nervous. Now when we visit my family I drive one way and he drives the other way. I still get nervous but it isn't nearly as bad as it used to be. Unless it's snowy, but winter driving just sucks."

DevilMayCry,ewj2zqi,t3_coi9wa,1565460585.0,"I agree with you, sure the dialogue was painful at times but I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I wish it didn't get so much hate. But I haven't played the original DMC games so I didn't come into DmC feeling like they messed up Dante because I had no frame of reference."
findapath,etc8qaz,t3_caqn8w,1562678638.0,"If you're not concerned with money, status, or possessions, why not spend your life traveling as much as possible?
When I was in high school one of my teachers had traveled quite extensively when he was younger (and he still traveled, just not as often). He had the best stories! He told us that he would work 2-3 jobs to save up the money for his next adventure, and he'd live as simply as possible to reduce his expenses. Then, when he was ready, he'd go travel until the money ran out. Rinse and repeat. Sounds like an amazing life to me!"

I have done some coding before and I have an artistic side. But that's not really what I had in mind. I contemplated a career in the video game industry years ago and ruled it out.

But this is different. The thing is, we are still a long way from full-dive VR and a lot of answers need to be found to make it possible. How do you create the necessary connection between brain and machine, especially in a non-invasive way? How do you program it so that your brain's signal to raise your arm translates to actually raising your arm in the game world? How do you make it so that the players can taste, touch, smell, etc.? The technology has to be invented before the game developers can start creating games. I want to do what it takes to develop the technology that will make it all possible."

Afterward you can go back to school for your associate's, if you want to. Have you worked in any sort of medical office or hospital before? It's an interesting world. I thought I wanted to be a radiographer, but now I'm glad that I didn't go down that road. I worked in a doctor's office and we also traveled to three hospitals. I found it too stressful. I don't mean to discourage you, but maybe it would be a good idea to get a job working in a hospital to make sure you like that sort of work setting before going to school again. If you like it, that's wonderful! If not, you'll know before you get deeper into debt."
