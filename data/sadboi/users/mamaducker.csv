AskDID,fivo6h5,t3_f28c1f,1582764380.0,"Wow I have never considered this before?! I don't think I have DID but diagnosed at around 20 with adult ADD, generalised anxiety and depression. However I do feel like I have competing parts of me, not like alters but I feel confused, like a walking contradiction often feeling like opposites clashing but I don't think this is tied to DID at all."

spss,fglmdqw,t1_fglm925,1580904284.0,Although I believe you would just use a regression analysis and then find the value along the regression line
spss,fglm925,t3_ez62ic,1580904144.0,"Would you not use a regression to test the predict the capacity? Might be wrong, just my first thought. Or do you mean actually predict the score if food is 80?"
biostatistics,fglm31y,t3_eywgai,1580903963.0,Now I'm coming from a psych statistics standpoint but is that not simply test retest reliability or internal consistency? If using spss I think you would just do a reliability analysis? Could be way way off

microdosing,fgh59pt,t3_eyek67,1580777012.0,"All I have to say is congratulations on finding something that has helped you! Depression, anxiety and mental health issues can be so, so hard and it can be a long, steep road to lasting improvements. The fact that despite being let go, which, like you said, can result in withdrawal and ruminating, you're beaming and excited for future prospects is awesome! All the best for your next adventure ðŸ˜Š"
