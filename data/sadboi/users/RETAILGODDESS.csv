depression,fcmfcbp,t3_ehyfk3,1577773180.0,"Hey there! I am 17 and I know a little about what you’re experiencing. I feel as if life is sometimes just a constant routine that needs to be broken because if it isn’t than things get very boring. When things are boring, life gets depressing and seems pointless. You’ve hit the nail on the head when you said that you must do something different (in order to break this routine). I do not personally know you, but I know your mindset. You just use school and your Xbox to get through the day, because the days do get repetitive. These may provide some comfort or no comfort at all. I would seriously recommend joining a club or sports team at school if you haven’t already, you may also consider volunteering in the community. Late is better than never! These things seem meaningless at first glance because they do end at some point, but they will let you see the beauty of being involved in life. This past summer I would’ve been so bored if I didn’t volunteer at a hospital! I would also recommend setting long term goals, this may entail a career or a big trip you want to take! :) anything that seems special to you somehow, you must dig deep within yourself to find this. You may feel surrounded by people at times, but how much of the social scene or experience at parties are you actually absorbing? You will feel alone if you are absorbing nothing. You will not be happy or excited about anything if you live out your days feeing truly alone. Things will not get better unless you do something that forces and encourages you to interact with other humans and the scene around it, you MUST learn to absorb your surroundings for what they are. In terms of drinking, this is not a healthy way to cope, and based off of the way you worded your comment, I’m sure you realize this. In short, you cannot drink your problems away. Drinking takes the mind off of what’s going on around you, it changes the way the mind perceives emotions by either making them dormant or enhanced. When you feel the urge to drink, go and jog a mile, read something online, volunteer or walk around the neighborhood, maybe cook something! You have the potential to enjoy your life, everyone does! You are not an empty person, you just need to change your perception (without alcohol)! You can do this, I know you can. Just make the most out of small things around you, and don’t over analyze your negative thoughts (especially the ones about yourself). I wish you the best of luck :) though I doubt you’ll need it! If you want to talk feel free to message me anytime!"
depression,fcmdofs,t3_ehyfma,1577771557.0,"Hey there fellow senior! I am in the exact same place as you right now. I have dogs, I go to school, I have a job, I feel the same way, I actually have one art credit to finish next semester before I can graduate. A lot of the things you do and describe are a big part of my day-to-day as well. I completely understand the feeling of wanting to move on and make a change, it is hard because I feel like I am trapped under this cloud of being a child, only I’m not really a child anymore. I am only 17 but the world isn’t so big to me anymore. I think the trouble of the relapse of depression or down thoughts comes with thinking, as you’ve mentioned. I start to think about all of my failures and about what I COULD be doing right now, now that I have the free time to do so. I compare myself to my peers, I am stressed about college already and I haven’t even completed high school. Ugh. I am on break now and it couldn’t be more miserable, I got rejected from my dream school, but got into some halfway decent schools. That isn’t enough to satisfy my conscience though, I will always question everything and anything and of course that entails myself and most aspects of my life. The best thing to do is (and I know it is way harder than it sounds) to just block those negative thoughts and worries. When one is about to come into your view just smack it away and forget about it. These thoughts are natural and usually the result of our anxiety trying to prepare us for potential bad, but most of the time such thoughts are unnecessary. I am burnt out already from my senior year (gotta love AP physics), but we only have one semester left, things will get better when we go off to college, whether that may be one state away or halfway across the planet. We will be free of being adults identified as children, we will then be adults identified as adults. We will have more of a drive to study and work hard (and have some fun in the process) because we will be on our own in a whole new world with new and exciting things that will make high school seem like a kids playground. Just let yourself relax when you are given the chance to, you have accomplished success, you have more than enough resources around you to keep your brain preoccupied with positivity at the moment. Life is NOT actually all that bad, things will turn up, just wait and you’ll see! I would love to hear where you plan to attend college and what you would like to study! I wish you the best of luck (though I doubt you’ll need it)!"

Has there been an occurrence of traumatic or displeasing events since you first started college? Why are you ACTUALLY upset about this? What could happen to help you feel better about your situation?

depression,fcmazvw,t1_fcm7nnt,1577769149.0,"The electrolyte imbalance that I was referring to was more specifically to people suffering from bulimia nervosa, when a person binge eats then purges. Vomiting can also lead to dehydration and dysregulation of the secretion of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone steroid hormone system which means that renal failure can develop in severe cases. With dehydration, emesis can result which affects the heart. Sinus tachycardia, hypotension, and orthostasis can put the heart and individual at risk of heart failure. These heart problems in this case are the direct result of a person purging, the electrolytes in our bodies are minerals that carry an electric charge, there are certain electrolytes that dissolve in the blood, for example sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. These act to help regulate nerve and muscle function, and maintain the diffusion of water into these parts of the body, they also help to maintain the acidity and alkalinity of these parts (thus maintaining a proper PH), when there is a deficiency of these one might experience muscle weakness, spasms and paralysis. The weakness and paralysis is what I’m referring to as the main down fall. When muscles are weakened a person feels more of an inability to move them, they then may reduce the frequency of movement and exercise, this is the reason that muscle is lost. Once the heart is weakened it may experience arrhythmia as the abnormal frequency is the body’s natural response to compensate for the lack of nutrients. Sorry this is long but I can explain more if needed :)"
depression,fcleqho,t3_ehmqfh,1577746090.0,"This is not an appropriate comment. There are some people on this subreddit who are depressed because of their weight and this comment encourages starvation and there progression of another potential mental illness or eating disorders. It is not healthy to starve yourself because you can easily degrade muscle first and you can develop permanent and pore fatal heart defects due to prolonged electrolyte imbalance. Please do not comment things like this here. I would understand if this was an awareness post, but to me it just seems like sarcasm poking fun at a more serious issue."

askdoctors,fc7fngg,t3_eghfz4,1577505996.0,"Hello, I am not a physician yet but I do know a lot about this. You took a good initiative in pushing the cranberry juice. You might also consider drinking at least a gallon of water everyday, this will help to filtrate your kidneys, the main filtration system in the body that converts cellular waste into urine. The more diluted the urine, the less bacteria per milliliter, this means that you will be excreting a LOT of the bad bacteria in your urinary tract. Ask your doctor to take a new urine sample and run the sample to a pathologist, who can identify exactly which type of bacteria is causing the infection. You may have a UTI, but you may not know exactly which type of bacteria is causing it, therefore you may not receive the proper treatment for the infection and it won’t be treated effectively. When you stop showing symptoms of a UTI than it is most likely the case that you have asymptomatic bacteriuria or less virulent bacteria in the urine. I know that this is a lot but consider talking with your doctor about this, but for home remedies here are a couple of suggestions: drink pineapple juice and take probiotics to help effectiveness of treatment. I hope this helped at least somewhat I wish you luck and good health! :)"

If you want your boyfriend and his family not to drop you then you must take initiative to get your license soon. If you’ve never driven a vehicle then ask your boyfriend or a member of his family to help you practice, this will show them that you care and are taking the next step.

My dad was in the hospital again and he has been in critical condition for the past three years. My managers have been cutting my hours to the point that I am not even on the schedule anymore. I see no use in smiling sometimes because some people are jerks and just blow it off. I have never been in a romantic relationship because I tried it once and the boy admitted he was lying about his feelings for me. Ugh. I know this is shit. I hate these parts of my life, they make me hate living. I have anxiety and OCD and on and off depression. I know the effects these disorders have on my life but I do not use them as an excuse to dwell. Dwelling feels good for a short while until it turns into sadness, which, if coupled with negativity and the unwillingness to change, causes depression, and where does that leave us? Dwelling has NO benefit at all. It is useless. You should not continue to push away other people who try to help you by saying kind words, yes corny and cheesy, but they are kind words. At least someone took the initiative to help. I am not berating you but I just wanted to say that life does suck a lot. Life is disappointing, but it does get better if you find happiness in small things and work your way up to the big picture. I am literally only 17 and I know this much about a terrible situation, but I have grown. I have big goals and aspirations and a minimal support team. I am the only one here for myself.

You don’t know my situation either, my dad was stricken down with an illness three years ago and has been suffering very painfully since then. I have witnessed careless people leaving him for dead in his most vulnerable state. I have seen him having seizure after seizure on his death bed. I am only 17 years old I was 14 when this first happened. My life has been a constant struggle. I had such bad social anxiety a couple of years ago that I could barely survive going to school. I have anxiety and OCD which used to rule my life a lot. I have controlled my OCD but my anxiety is bad. I also suffer from hypochondriasis. I have an internal battle as well as an external battle. Life is not easy for me, but I gain strength in helping other people. My dad has had an array of health problems including a stroke, when he had this I seriously contemplated various methods to take my own life. I have never received any counseling for any of this. I have had to pull myself out of depression as it made my other disorders progress. I chose not to live my life in a cloud of anger and sadness. I found relief when I did this. I didn’t want to live that way ever again, I was tired of it! It is no way to live! Life is too short to put yourself through that. It’s just no way to live, that is why people commit suicide, because they don’t want to live in the depression anymore. I get it. I know what it feels like to desire a near end. But you were put onto this planet for a reason, to live. Some people never even get a chance at life. Some people never get to open their eyes and see the world. Oh but they would love to be able to type on reddit if they had the ability. This is why I say to be positive, I’m not berating you, but you just jumped to conclusions before you knew why I truly say these things. My dad is wheelchair bound and is suffering as we speak. It kills me everyday. My sleep used to be effected. But I’m past this now. I’ve experienced things that most adults only see when they’re older. I was forced to grow up and control my inner thoughts, I was forced to find my own strengths and goals.

I don’t know you or your partner but I know that if they thought that you were a true embarrassment that they would not want you in their life at all. But obviously they don’t think this and that is why they have you in their life! :) I can tell you something, I know what it’s like to feel as if I’m a burden on someone, it makes me feel worthless and completely drains me of all self esteem and hope. You are a human and so is the rest of the human population, most of the differences between us are minimal, we may look different and act different but we are all mostly built the same. We each have a heart, a soul and a head. How we use these things are the reason why we are truly different. It is not good for you to be taking random medication to punish yourself. I would suggest having a serious heart to heart conversation with your partner, tell them how you feel! One day you may discover that these pills cause you permanent illness and when you are in a good relationship that you enjoy, that will effect you negatively and it will also affect your partner negatively. You care about them and you care about yourself otherwise you wouldn’t be posting this personal stuff on reddit. I know it may be hard to grasp but you are worth more than you know. Stay positive :) Always look toward the sun light because there is a part of you shining in it everyday! You WILL get through this, and things WILL get better! But please, do not take pills anymore that you don’t need because you are YOU and you cannot control what others think/believe about you. If you love yourself than it should NEVER matter what others (yes even your partner) think about you! I wish you the best of luck, and remember, you are worth more than you know!"
depression,fc4wwpr,t3_eg6t84,1577431858.0,"Hello there! I just wanted to start off by saying that I am sorry to hear all of this is going on in your life right now. I am sorry to hear about your parents maybe getting a divorce. It’s always hard to see the two people who raise you, on the verge of splitting. I know it really is difficult on you and your sister because no person should ever have to see this! Unfortunately this happens and you just have to push through it, you must be there for your mom especially when she feels down because of the whole situation! Your parents are lucky to have you because you are strong enough to attend a university in another country and you are a good person for wanting a change! I’m sorry that school/life balance may be a struggle and that you are having trouble sleeping. A lot of times these things are caused by stress, you may be stressed from university and the means to pay for it, but remember you are also stressed about your parents and your relationship of five years heading onto a rocky path. You MUST practice eustress exercises, and this does not only mean physical exercise, it means enjoying some part of life! You have to counsel yourself if you don’t have the time to see a professional, you know that you have potential to succeed! You will grow from this situation if you haven’t already and it is A LOT to deal with it is terrible but it is also a blessing in disguise because it helps you to grow. I am also sorry to hear that your dad sees you as a man who needs to “man up” when feeling upset. My dad was like that sometimes (even though I’m a girl) and it’s hard because when you have to “man up” you keep the emotions bottled up inside which can be very frustrating. This frustration leads to stress which can lead to depression if it is not released. You have to release this stress somehow, so what you need to ask yourself is “What can I do to relieve a lot of this stress?” Well the simple answer is to write it down, this means literally making a new journal entry when something bad happens or pops into your head. You also may benefit from painting or drawing! If you find that you don’t have the time for any of this than think logically about it for a second, dissect all of your thoughts and be real with yourself about the severity of things. Things may seem bad at the moment but evaluate them for what they actually are as things are not all as bad as they may seem ( though I’m not saying that your situation isn’t severe). You have to accept the things that you CAN CHANGE and the things that you CANNOT CHANGE. You are YOU and not them, in terms of your parents, you cannot put yourself in their places so the only thing you can do is talk with them about how you feel about their behavior, do this with them individually and then together. With your partner, establish what was keeping your relationship stable and fulfilling in the beginning and try to understand why it has changed and what is different now. When you do this talk with them and let them know how you feel. With your sister, the best thing you can do is be there for her, show her that everything WILL be okay, I’m sure she looks up to you in some way. She can learn from your positive example! Sorry this post is so long, but you have to work things out for yourself first and that starts with releasing some of your stress in healthy ways. Be creative. Have fun. Enjoy the small things! This is not permanent, things will get easier! You are the catalyst for improvement in your life, so go and start now! Try to calm down a bit and relax more. Do not worry so much as it stresses you out, stress does nothing beneficial for you especially during times like these! Remember that you have more potential than you know, and you can fix this, you will make this right! Stay positive:) Look toward the sunlight because there is some of you in it everyday! I hope everything goes okay and I wish you luck!"

depression,fc4vex7,t3_eg6tvu,1577429990.0,"Your kids are a blessing! You MUST stay here for them! We don’t really know what is beyond life into the realm of death, we all hope that it is a peaceful place of rest, free of pain, but there is no way to know. I’m sorry about your car breaking down so much, I swear every time my car is working okay for a couple of weeks it has ANOTHER PROBLEM. Gotta love modern transportation! Anyway, I know why you feel this way, I feel this way sometimes. Sometimes I want a quick and painless escape from my situation. But something else, life is always making room for disappointment and sadness, yet it also throws amazing gifts into the mix (your kids!:))! You have to cherish them because they were put into your life for a reason. They need you whether or not they realize this! You were put into their lives to make a positive impact! You still have the chance to do so if you feel you haven’t already. You must show them the person you truly are (who I’m sure is amazing!) just your presence is already a positive impact on them. Some kids are never able to even know who their parents are. Some parents are unable to know who their children are or are unable to have children all together! You are very lucky to have them, and to have life. Life is worth living even though it gets cloudy sometimes. Sometimes can turn into oftentimes too, but you must find light in the darkness. When you prosper through the negative aspects of life you shine, because stars will shine brightest in the presence if darkness! It’s inevitable to shine so brightly when darkness surrounds your goodness :) How can you do this though? Find a hobby, or a group of peers. I would recommend volunteering at a hospital or at a food pantry or doing community service, maybe try a painting class or a cooking class, try running a quarter of a mile and work your way up to a full mile (maybe even two miles!) but whatever interests you is good! Here, in these activities you can find friends or even a family. You have SO much potential so don’t waste it! Stay positive :) you are worth so much more than you know! And remember to look toward the sunlight because there is a part of you in it everyday!"
retail,fc4ubm8,t1_fc4u110,1577428726.0,"Oh I’m sorry to hear this! Retail had sucked all of my humanity from my conscience. Ugh. I hope you regain the ability because retail is a bore and people who have never worked in retail always tell me that I’m overly dramatic but it’s the sad reality of the job. Glad to hear you aren’t in that hell hole we call Walmart, anymore!"
depression,fc4u6du,t3_eg6v1y,1577428564.0,"I’m very sorry to hear this. I am 17 and I cannot imagine my lifetimes worth of hell like this! I hope things get better for you and your family! You are smart and genuine because you are able to acknowledge that behavior like this is morally wrong. You are you and NOT them. You are NOT what your past situation was. You are wise now because of this because it taught you how exactly not to live and because of this, rest assured, you will not let something like this enter into your life again. You have a lot of potential because you are strong from this unfortunate situation with your mom and dad and your siblings. It is important to remember where you came from, but with limitations because you cannot spend your days rehashing all of the negative events. You must move along and make a future for yourself. Follow your dreams (I know this sounds corny) and do what your heart desires because there is a drive instilled within you to succeed, and because of this I believe that you will be successful (even though I don’t know you)! Stay positive :) look toward the sunlight because there is a part of you shining in it everyday! I wish you good luck, though I doubt you’ll need it. I wish for the best for your mom, dad and your siblings!"
depression,fc4tmuw,t3_eg6v54,1577427966.0,"Hey there! Study what you desire! Someone is paying for that degree and it is better if not wasted on something you don’t enjoy. Some things look good on paper but in reality they are not all that. Your degree usually paves the way to a job in the future so it would not be a good thing to land a job in a field that you dislike. It’s never too late to start over and study what you want (despite what your family, friends, or people at your university say). It’s depressing to buckle down and dig deep within yourself only to realize “hey, I just wasted all of this time studying something that I would rather not study, when I could have been studying something else that I would rather have studied. Dang it!” Better late than never! The past is the past and your future is yet to be determined as it falls into your hands! I wish you luck and success! I don’t think you need it though because you are a person who is smart enough to realize the situation at hand! Stay positive. You CAN do it!"
depression,fc4t3e0,t3_eg6vq0,1577427376.0,"I do this. I stay at home and do absolutely NOTHING (well, except eat and watch YouTube). It’s depressing for me to browse social media when I do this. I will see other people out having a good time with friends and family. My crush likes their posts but never my own. Ugh. It sucks to feel this way, it’s frustrating how life leaves room for moments like these to occur. It’s annoying and terrible. But there is something you must remember amidst these negative moments, other people have fun and have fulfilling lives surrounding them, they are humans, you are also a human and are capable of having just as much fun and happiness surrounding you as they have surrounding them! Let yourself have fun! Let positive thoughts in and invite them to stay. Life is MUCH to short to spend your days dwelling on the sad aspects of your life. You are worth SO much and you have SO much potential. You may have goals and dreams, you aspire to be something great that can help you achieve your desired happiness. You may not know what that is yet, so take some time and do some soul searching, (I recommend a personality than a career quiz online most of them are free to take) but if you do know what you want out of life than work toward it. It is hard work but it is worth it and truthfully so are you! Stay positive and look toward the sunlight, it is something that will never leave your side, and I know that part of you shines brightly with it! :) you’ve got this!"
depression,fc4sict,t3_eg76f7,1577426764.0,"I’m so sorry that you are having these thoughts, nobody deserves to experience such sadness, especially internally! I truly mean what I say! You are strong and you really DO have so much potential. I feel this way sometimes, I just wish to escape it all painlessly and quickly, but we do not know what truly lies beyond life in the realm of death, we hope for beauty and grace but nobody can say that for certain, so it is extremely important to grasp the helpful opportunities in life to help others around us and to help ourselves most importantly! If you have any interests in mind or any goals than I just wanted to let you know that I don’t know you but I know that you can certainly achieve those. Stay positive. There is a future out there for you whether or not you realize it. :) life is a cool journey worth exploring!"
depression,fc4s68s,t3_eg6xtu,1577426420.0,"I do this sometimes, with a parent who is gravely ill you learn to expect things to turn to shit quickly and often. It’s a psychological defense mechanism called avoidance. We hope for the best but constantly expect the worst as we want to prepare ourselves for future rejection and disappointment. As I said before, I do this sometimes but I used to do it all of the time. The key to being happy is expecting happiness because anticipation is more exciting than the actual even itself! Stay positive! You will succeed if you expect good things to happen!"
depression,fc4rwbx,t3_eg76f7,1577426143.0,"I don’t know what you are going through but depression is a mental illness and it rules lives! You must live to see the future, you have so much potential as a human! Stay positive even when life gives you crap! You are WAY stronger than you know. Please see small things and notice their beauty! Look to the sun, it won’t burn out in this lifetime...you have plenty of time :)"

Life,fc4qw4c,t3_ef8rau,1577425146.0,It’s not I promise you! I question my life at times. Relationships are tough because they are what our lives truly revolve around. It’s difficult but it’s important to use this as an opportunity to grow and use your inner strength to counsel yourself to a mindset that will set you up for success! Your certainly sounds bright and I guarantee it will be. Stay positive!
