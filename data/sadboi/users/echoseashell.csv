GriefSupport,fqdaouw,t1_fqbt9a8,1589285046.0,"I understand the fear of triggering family, and you’ve lived with illness in your family for a long time. This dynamic has imposed more responsibility than is reasonable on you. You are responsible for your own feelings and actions, but you are not responsible for any one else’s. They are on their own path that is not yours to control.

With that said, talking about your feelings with your sister may help release your sister’s feelings as well because she might then feel safe to share hers (or not, but maybe). If you are not comfortable talking to her about them then write a journal. Even if it’s scraps of paper you throw away, because your mind recognizes that you are doing something with those feelings and it helps to process them. Btw, you write beautifully.

Something else I thought I’d mention, I attended a Bereavment group for a time and the complaint about friends and family not talking about the dead was common. Friends would even avoid the bereaved. We came to the conclusion that people were afraid to bring up something painful and/or just didn’t know how to talk about it because it makes them uneasy. You are in a club that most people end up joining, but in modern times we are very disjointed from this part of existence. 

Finally, there was a suggestion for how to include loved ones who had passed on. At holiday dinners (or really any time you want), light a candle for each missing loved one and then a poem was read ... I will add when I find it. 

Good luck with your endeavors, your Mom gifted you with love and grace. She is still with you and will always be.

Something that did get through to my brain was realizing all the worry and hyper vigilance is worse than the actual event. And most things are not actual emergencies. It helps to talk to someone for perspective.

For example, for a time, I was taking care of my parents house, and at the time was dealing with grief and other issues surrounding family, so my mind was already strained. I started noticing sounds that were unfamiliar to me. For all I know, those sounds could have been there previously, but they were new to my awareness. Any time the furnace kicked on I was convinced it was going to blow up. My senses were in high gear and I would notice everything and remained in a state of panic. 

I felt powerless because I didn’t have knowledge of what I was dealing with, but it was hardly the potential emergency that my brain made it out to be. Eventually, I had the sense to have someone look at it and all was fine, just some maintenance.

One of the responses was from a physician and a former molecular virologist who believes that metabolic syndrome is what ties the risk factors of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity together. He wrote that metabolic syndrome is a pro-inflammatory state and that this may be the increased risk for the cytokine storm. He also mentioned that the amount of virus you first encounter may be important in how severe a case is. If it’s a small amount, it may give your immune system time to deal with the virus, but if you are exposed to a large initial amount, your immune response will be large and risk the cytokine storm. ... that’s if I understood it all correctly."

politics,fkaysg5,t1_fkay1db,1584022537.0,Medicare wouldn’t leave the old to die in a pandemic. That would have more to do with hospital management and how well the system can care for an overwhelming number of people. You think that won’t happen now regardless of insurance type?

It’s encouraging to me that so many people are engaged and conversing about the status of our current system and what would work better. It takes courage to take a real hard look at where we are, and to course correct for a better future."

CPTSD,fjw95xw,t3_fdso6s,1583636750.0,"Today is the anniversary of when I found my dad having suffered a heart attack. He survived several months after in ICU, but never fully recovered. I’ve lived a shadow of a life. On one hand, I long for the days when I felt safe because I had the necessities my parents provided, but then I have so much anger from the lack of actual love from my father. I remember hating him so much when I was younger. That fear of doing the wrong thing meaning the threat of all of it taken away has played out even after his death. I feel the way I was raised didn’t actually protect me, only made me vulnerable to real dangers that have hurt my life because I can’t tell the difference between what is good for me and what isn’t. I am learning and trying, but I guess today just triggered my grief, hurt and anger. On the one hand I want to light a candle for him but I don’t have a candle. When alive he would be angry with me even if I did the right thing if it wasn’t done exactly right (the way he saw it) or on time. On the other hand I want to scream at the sky in anger for the pain inflicted on me for no good reason. Thank you for letting me vent here. I miss him but I guess I’m still angry with him all these years later."

CPTSD,fjk0w5o,t3_fdnzp7,1583417476.0,"Thank you for this post! You have touched on something important; our work culture is sick, it’s not you. I feel modern religion (the prosperity kind) has fed into this too - it’s made doing materially well a moral goal that people judge other people by and it’s sick. Basically if you are doing well or just have a lot of money, you must be favored by god. Not at all the message of the New Testament, but definitely the religion of capitalism.

I’m older and wasted my young adult life in a career that I was good at but the people and the company I worked for made it so toxic that I eventually burnt out (additionally, they went full bankrupt after I left because they were run by vulture capitalists). 

After leaving I had several years of life throwing major events at me and I haven’t recovered yet. You’re upbringing sounds a lot like mine except my father was domineering and strict with inconsistent rules. Perfect training for being taken advantage of in our work culture. 

I grew up fearing hierarchy and people pleasing. My bosses took advantage of my vulnerability to please and ultimately contributed greatly to my burnt out. 

My recommendation to you is challenge what you think is expected of you, find ways to support yourself that is outside of our sick culture as much as you can. There are necessities that we all need regardless of the work culture like food, shelter, water. Maybe find a job related to any of that like organic small farm, carpenter, or water testing (just spitballing, many of these things have been co-opted by the culture too but you also learn skills that enhance life regardless of the system). Maybe find an employee owned company to work for? Keep creativity in your life the best you can because it’s a balm to weather life. Good luck! The more people who recognize what’s going on the better chance we have to change it (btw, Bernie is the closest we have to someone who is fighting for real people)."
