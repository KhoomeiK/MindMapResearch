Yes you can describe they way those females look and behave but you cannot actually understand that they are women without having men as a reference.

It's very frustating to me that so many people live as if they don't know this fact. Maybe it's just the way we were programmed to surivive.

Existential_crisis,fmz8mfm,t3_fyaopf,1586510719.0,"Yes this also happened to me. People look at you like you have gone crazy or something when they are the ones acting strange because they take life for granted...

And this hurts but I stopped talking about it to people who just live their regular life and don't want to be confronted with those kind of questions.
I think the reason why people get aggressive or defensive when being asked those questions is that there is trurly no answer to them and maybe theybare scared to see the truth that they are as ""lost"" as you.

Stay curious!!!"
