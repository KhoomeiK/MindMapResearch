I don't have a great answer but I at least have this: for many forms of assault, you can't do much to stop it. You, or your daughters. Basically, preventing the situation lies with the perpetrator, not the potential victim. 

The ways in which it can be helped, you seem to be doing a great job with. Being educated on how not to fall victim to manipulation is important. But honestly, one of the most impactful things I've seen is setting an example. Show your daughters the caliber of man they need to trust, and set them up with the expectations of what they can have. Many women get into abusive or manipulative situations because its what they're used to, as they don't have a better example. I see this ALL THE TIME. 

It's easier for your daughters to see that they aren't being treated properly when they know what its like to be treated properly, basically. They are tiny humans and they will learn and grow, you can't hammer in every aspect of what you think they should know because it's nowhere near as effective as showing them and letting them learn for themselves."

That is something way easier said than believed for your type of obsession, though. There are plenty of 15 year olds who look 20 and 20 year olds that look 15. In that moment you didnt *card* your fantasy participant, their age is what you say it is, in that moment, not later when you're guilting yourself. And that age may just be what you think someone of that age would look like. When I fantasize, they never have a specific age. They are just an adult of some type. You can look back and say, ""wow, she actually seemed pretty young"". But if you weren't intending to fantasize about a child and you just imagined a cute girl with soft features, that's okay. 

Also, you may want to look into graysexual, from what little you've told me it might be a better fit than demisexual. 

Either way, from an unbaised third party, I think your fantasies are pretty normal and you have nothing to be ashamed about. I understand you're not comfortable in your body, but you are absolutely deserving of affection and love.

I want to try and relieve some of your concerns as someone who is OCD but not of this type. I can empathize with your delusions but I don't have them. I really hope I don't make any of your concerns worse. tl;dr of this is that I dont believe you're doing anything wrong.

I am a pansexual female who is usually more attracted to women. First off, don't apologize for using the terms top and bottom, they are very normal in the community. 

I am attracted to cute, sweet, kind, and gentle women. I also prefer short women! This is a very normal and acceptable type to have. A lot of these qualities can be considered child-like. I also have kinks around things like domination. So I'll put it like this. My sexual fantasies could be seen in many different ways. If you picked apart every aspect of my sexuality and kinks and assumed the absolute worst, I could easily be conveyed as some horrific predator. This is what you are doing. However, you could also view my sexuality and kinks as what they are, a normal, albeit more niche, morally acceptable sexual interest. 

I like sweet and innocent women because I love to take care of them. I love like a caretaker and I adore the women I'm with. In the bedroom, I love opening their eyes to the huge spectrum of sexual pleasure, and seeing them experience that for the first time (for example, your virginity fantasy) is REALLY HOT! 

I will also say that I am hypersexual, so I have had some moral issues from the insane bullshit my brain comes up with to get off. Sometimes I'll fantasize about something that I later feel like wasn't a behavior I'd ever want to engage with IRL, and could totally feel shame about it. It is not uncommon even so far as to people having full on r*pe kinks, especially those who fantasize being on the recieving end, DO NOT WANT THAT IRL! It is okay to have some discrepancies between what you fantasize about and what you would do. This does not make you a monster. 

Deciding where to draw the line in your fantasies is probably a great thing to discuss with your therapist. You may also benefit from writing out what you'd like them to know in a journal so you can say everything exactly how you want to say it. My therapist lets me do this and I know of several other friends who do the same thing. 

But please, please dont punish yourself for any of this. Especially considering that you aren't even sure if you did what you think you did, or if you havent spoken with a professional and decided if it's actually okay to have some of your moral fantasies. I just really think it's important that you never punish yourself for something you aren't sure you did or not. Punishing yourself at all is not good. But at least make the first step not punishing yourself for what you think you may have done a year ago. (Sorry this paragraph is devolving, my meds are kicking in, haha). 

The final thing I want to say is that I really dont think any of this was that bad at all. I'm not the official MoralDecider™ by any means. I can tell you are someone who is suffering so greatly, and I hope you can ease some of that while working through all of this. Please dont leave us yet, you aren't the monster you think you are, you're just someone with obsessions who is trying to figure out their sexuality. I don't mean to minimize you when I say that, either. This is a big clusterfuck you're gonna have to spend some time working out. But it will be worth it. You seem incredibly intelligent, talented too! And you've got your other half who can help you through all this too. Please don't give up. 

Love from a survivor. <3"

Such a reaction to being touched leads me to believe that her personal space had been violated in a very extreme way. Being able to have a place that is only hers that she is safe in would give her something invaluable. 

I'm still going to say NAH nonetheless because I empathize with trying to balance taking on such a huge task while also trying to be a good parent. I think for now, this is a side effect of growing pains and no one is an asshole here, despite mistakes being made, like with grounding you. Family counseling is super important here. 

It's worth mentioning that there are a LOT of teenagers on here. They are going to agree with you so long as parents can be the enemy in any way, because naturally its really fucking frustrating to be a kid under their thumb. But I want you to think about the intentions of your parents. If this continues, especially if counseling doesn't happen, they are absolutely TA. Advocate for yourself, be respectful, hold them accountable to change, and keep your social worker in the loop so they can know if your parents are handling this properly. 

It's a lot to ask a teenager, or anyone really, to make sacrifices when they don't have a choice. I hope that it will work out in the end, and Jess is able to have the invaluable comradery of a sister, and a chance at a better life. If this goes well it will absolutely enrich yours too."

TwoXChromosomes,fnsrvxh,t3_g3nso2,1587227622.0,"Even when I didn't get attention for my physical appearance I would get close guy friends getting attached because I was very emotionally available to them. I didn't know better and let myself be their therapist, my friends have always been nerds that often struggled to get any level of female attention, so even if I wasn't a looker I would sometimes have problems anyway.

The annoyance and betrayal came to me from becoming objectified and put on a pedestal by the crush-er. Like I said, very little female attention for them. So I became a fantasy and they started treating me and viewing me different. The ""manic pixie dream girl"" problem really. I was an end goal, something to attain, and the biggest thing was their INTENTIONS. Even a respectful guy could possibly give skewed support, like being a little trigger happy about encouraging you to leave your partner in a difficult phase, or discouraging you from leaving a job if it means they get to see you more. Etc.

That aside I completely understand where you're coming from. Maybe you are not the type of woman who is easily taken advantage of by desperate men. Maybe you are very lucky and have genuinely good men in your friend group that you rightfully couldn't imagine treating you like that. But with anything, either extreme is very difficult to deal with, however that doesn't invalidate your experience."

You were weary of his ""type"", but to me this sounds like he's fitting in to that metric exactly, however you know him and love him so you naturally see the good things that you don't see in guys like this from a distance. 

My SO is more attracted to me when I'm in shape, that is a fact that we have worked through together and I think it's fair for him to have those feelings. However he never had a ""you're great, except"" mentality about it. Like I was serving him and just unfortunately not fitting his full requirements. He obviously deeply, wholly loves me in every sense of the word and makes sure I know that every single day in any way he can think of. I'm just really getting an... ""eh, you'll do"" vibe from your guy from these comments. 

He sounds pretty fuckin shallow, it's okay to have preferences but again, you don't have to give him praise for doing the bare minimum. If you have a fun and interesting relationship, cool, but girl, don't marry this fuckin guy. You cant marry someone who makes you feel insecure, and then markets it to you like it's reason. You're going to get even more skin and more flaps and folds as you get older, if he's not already cherishing your appearance now, he'll be running off with his secretary in 20 yrs if that matters so much to him."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fgqoqm9,t1_fgpdl45,1581028317.0,"That's a fair point. However it could be the angle of ""parents choice"" vs ""mandatory"" vaccination, as that is a moral/ethics argument, same as an abortion argument I had in the biology class I referenced. It doesn't really matter though, I wasn't even really talking about what this circumstance had to be, just that it's possible to be assigned a stance on a project. I'm quite certain there was good reasoning if it was even a real situation at all."
ShitMomGroupsSay,fgoomt3,t1_fgo88lz,1580978887.0,"There were a few times I had a mandatory assignment and was assigned a position, but it was a thought exercise for a class debate. It was assigned randomly and the purpose was not to make them support it, just an exercise in formulating an argument. I did this in my freshman biology course and a public speaking course. I also did it constantly for debate class as you were required to write up arguments for both sides and be ready to present them by a coin toss. 

So yes, you can be required to write an argumentative paper from a position you dont support, however it's not a negative thing and was incredibly enriching for me."

schizophrenia,fgf35gy,t1_fgf2v9r,1580721850.0,"I am relatively okay. I am very blessed that I reached out to online communities for bipolar disorder, and there are a lot of schizoaffective people in there. It gave me a lot of perspective and started dismantling the very terrible ideas society portrays about schizophrenia. If I have it, I have it. I can still live my life, I'm used to living with barriers already. I want to be a psychiatric technician. I just hope if this develops further that I can get treatment and still have the job I really want. After I wrote this all out I realized things were worse than I really realized. I have sent an email to my therapist to start going back. She can't diagnose or treat me but she can help me figure out what's going on, and direct me to resources if I need it. 

The only thing I'm really afraid of is having a full blown episode and getting hurt. Cops around here don't handle mental illness well. Literally 2 weeks ago a college student was shot and killed by a police officer after having a psychotic episode. That scares me a lot."
