This would happen even if it was just someone speaking and they got too loud, I would be afraid they were gonna start yelling. It wasn't until I really thought about it that I realized that it's because I associated quiet to loud really quickly as danger because my parents would often go from quiet to loud really quickly when fighting and my mother would also go quiet to loud really quickly when yelling at me. I'm getting better but there are still times when a person gets a little too loud that it sets me on edge and it's almost like my body is preparing itself to get away if needed."

AskReddit,fr03jh3,t3_glm7gq,1589782678.0,"This happened when I was in 5th grade but I went to a small school so the elementary, middle  and high school were all connected. There was a family in which the mother had left the father and taken their daughter because he was abusive and violent and the daughter happened to attend our school and because the mother had been unable to find somewhere else to live away from our town she had been staying with her parents therefore the dad knew the daughter was still attending the school. The school had been notified about some of what was going on and knew that under no circumstances should the daughter be allowed to see her dad even if he showed up at school. Well lo and behold there was a day he showed up at the high school office (this was before the school had automatically locking doors and you could just walk right in) and demanded that she be brought to him. Our receptionist refused by saying that she was in class and the police eventually came and took him away but not before he claimed that he had planted bombs in the school. So the police are called and we were taken to the high school gym and then eventually taken outside before being allowed back in to the classrooms. We knew the K-9s had been through because my teacher had those inflatable balls with questions on them and one had obviously been clawed. We students were never told if anything was found but the guy did go to jail for something and then despite being a small town we never really talked about it again."

She also said depending on what the assignment was she could only knock so many letter grades off. I was shocked because the idea that a student could turn in an assignment from the beginning of the year at the end of the year and still get a passing grade was insane.

I was almost never on the bus because I had after school activities but I knew this kid was bothering my brother because it got to the point that my brother had bruises from the kid. My dad had taken pictures and shown it to the principal and they didn't do anything because they had had no complaints from the bus driver. Well one day my brother snapped and kneed the guy in the balls and hit him and the school tried to pull the whole zero tolerance bullshit and suspend my brother for a couple of days. They very quickly changed their tune when my dad showed them that he still had the pictures of bruises with dates on them and documentation that he had talked to the principal about it.

Well she cooks it and it looks alright so she doesn't think anything about it and takes it to the party where everybody's like ""ooo 7-up cake"" and they all have some. Well because she added so soda it was heavily carbonated and everybody was basically burping after a single bite. My grandfather said nobody had the heart to tell her that it was way to much soda and just kinda suffered through eating some. Apparently my great uncle did later mention to her to dial back the soda and it was much better after that."

It's been that way for a while and while I appreciate some of the things she's done for me I don't love her and I can't even say it. By today was Mother's day and all I've seen is posts about how great people's mothers are. It makes me feel both guilty and jealous because right now I have to live with my mother due to the current situation and why can't I have a mother that I actually love. It doesn't help that my mother will mope around because neither me or my brother did anything. I did tell her I appreciate the stuff that she's done but that was really it. I'm just tired of having to fake my emotions and pretend I love her when I feel like I haven't in years and then she tries to make us feel bad about it. Sorry about the rant but I'm just tired."
Anxiety,fq8lb0b,t3_ghev4f,1589168879.0,Yes I've noticed that some but not all of my anxiety comes from mostly my relationship with my mother. As a child she would push me to be perfect especially when dealing with grades and awards. That has translated over to a lot of my anxiety whether it's grades or if I feel like I'm not liked well enough by someone. Even now a lot of my anxiety is related to stuff that involved her such as trying to be more forward or not being afraid to speak up.
TheGoodPlace,fq8krzr,t3_gh3iw5,1589168512.0,I had somebody once wish me a happy mother's day even though I was only about 17 and single at the time. I guess I looked older?

AskReddit,fq8jaqf,t1_fq5rwat,1589167507.0,Yeah I kinda get wanting to watch shitty reality TV every once in a while but to sit down and watch it to the point of knowing literally everything about a person is just weird.
AskReddit,fq8ic2t,t1_fq6dp6p,1589166863.0,"Similar to this, not wanting to tell people your successes because they'll just be like ""okay."" I tell my mother things like I got all A's and made the dean's list and instead of a good job it's just a ""okay"" almost like why are you even telling me. I've had people be surprised that I haven't shared successes with them because I'm not used to having positive reactions."
Epilepsy,fq6j0sr,t1_fq6auq5,1589132463.0,Thank you! My major is social work with a minor in criminology.

rupaulsdragrace,fq1h0lf,t3_gggi9u,1589045572.0,"I definitely agree and I'm glad Michelle called her out on it. The only reason I can think of why they would let her keep going is because of footage purposes and even then you think they would be like ""you've gone almost 15 minutes over."" The only reason she was safe is because it's obvious that the producers were pushing for her to be the first big camp queen to win and at least be in the top 4 and then shit went down. Poor Jaida had to stand on the main stage and accept (redacted's) apology so she wouldn't look bad. Even in untucked the apology was half assed and all ""oh I didn't realize"" like you are a seasoned performer, you know how long performances go you're just a terrible person."

Epilepsy,fq0q42f,t1_fq0p7d6,1589035865.0,Yeah I eventually had to contact my neurologist after a month because one night it literally felt like I could not move and it was terrifying. Luckily they were able to mess with the dosage and it got a little better.
Epilepsy,fq0o4fg,t1_fq0lzm7,1589034995.0,Thank you so much and yeah most recently I had a medication where one of the rare side effects was tiredness and sudden weakness and it was terrible trying to get school work done when I just wanted to constantly sleep lol
Scrubs,fq0kvzf,t3_ggf8tc,1589033570.0,I always liked this moment because I feel like we always see OCD portrayed as something that the person just dealt with. It was nice to see somebody who was annoyed and tired of dealing with it but of course still has to deal with it anyways.
AskReddit,fq0gx9g,t1_fpzjyls,1589031693.0,I partly based it off My Favorite Things but made it my own. I always try to think of the little things when I can.
Epilepsy,fpzj48i,t1_fpzhifz,1589018944.0,Thank you and I really am so happy!
