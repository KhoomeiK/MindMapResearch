Magento,fc7y00c,t1_fc7waru,1577521633.0,"No it is not. 
The same idea is purchasing something like SAP or Oracle; having it deployed, and THEN having the expectation that it actually works!!! 

Having database development becoming your core business only makes sense if you are a database developer! 

Not if you are a plumber, dentist, psychologist, store keeper etc; who also has an online presence and offers online ordering of products and services.

And I don't care if you're the size of Kohls or Costco, it STILL makes no sense.

PS: Been through more than one software deployment.

These folks will need to step it up; or say goodbye to all their business.

I got one word for you; Symfony. They're coming and they're coming fast, and they aren't the only ones.

Let the dolts happy to spend 2/3rds of their Gross revenue maintaining broken software knock themselves out. 

Most people, are not dolts. They want to put the money where it makes sense; like their core business.

So Magento--take heed or not; soon--nobody will care either way, save the folks who eat and pay bills by the creation and maintenance of your software."

Magento,fc7ulst,t1_fc74w92,1577519046.0,"If running a store; where your core competency is selling merchandise to end customers requires a gaggle of in-house computer engineers; then the platform is garbage. 

Nowhere else in business is this acceptable. For example, medium to semi large distribution & manufacturing houses buy software to run their operation on all the time; and not ONCE does it require expertise outside of their own IT department save the training given by the deployment team. 

So this is BS."
Mediums,f6b08md,t1_f4g9bni,1572765920.0,"Thank you so much, I'm glad the expectation is not to be dead on all the time. I  think what I will do is practice as a hobby, until my confidence is up.

Mediums,f4ehu14,t1_f4ee8vt,1571558138.0,"I do too Ricotta, one of the many reasons I have shied away. I do believe that all professionals should get paid for their work though. So I have no issue there. I have also paid for various readings in the past, in my earlier development.

For me, I think I would need to be to a certain caliber in order to do it. That, and the on-the-spot pressure of always being ""on the mark"". And burnout.

Before I was able to lift my vibration, and shut off the activity--I went through a period of getting knowledge about people who were on the news, people who were murdered or disappeared. Today I see it as sacred angel of death duty; but that one gave me pause.

The medium readings however have always been beautiful. I only hope that the people who were asking got what I got from them.

I'm thinking that if you feel up to it, and that this is somewhere you want to take your life, why not. You are clearly fairly seasoned at it.

So--do you read Seth, or Dolores Cannon? For me, they were gold in opening up my knowledge and bettering my connection with my higher self. It just came to me as you were saying you wanted more development. Well--really though, I could talk metaphysics around the clock for days LOL.

So as for spiritual responsibility, I don't think there is any, beyond what we already have day to day. Provided what is offered for the service is fair of course. To me, intent is the key there. But then again, money is just a form of spiritual currency. And when we give we are always compensated, in one way or another.

What about FB readings? If you use FB? I've done a few free ones in there, and know several people who do paid readings, or readings for donation / love offering. Some have Patreon linked up, some have PayPal, some have a website w/a payment platform, fiverr, and so forth.

Anyway, great to chat with you on here. I'm here now because in the last few days I've been pondering doing more readings again.

And I think I have answered my own question that I had LOOOL! Donation based, the answer is donation based--for me. That would be my get-out-of-jail-free card for when the experience doesn't meet the expectation.

I see this group has a chatroom. Those I love, because you get instant energetic feedback with the querent.

Thanks so much for hanging out with me Ricotta.

All my love.  


Edit: Spelling -- dropped a letter."
Mediums,f4edakr,t1_f4ebdn3,1571556093.0,"I guess I need to learn how to choose a flair LOL.   


This is exactly what I describe myself as, and have for years. I am very guarded with it; not so much because of the spirits, they and I are fine---but the folks that have physical bodies.   


It is actually to the point that I have chosen not to work as a professional medium because of it. My empathic ability is on the intense end of the spectrum LOL. Add to that my penchant for forgetting names, validation freaks me out if there is money involved.   


Then there's the folks that want me to read their future. I don't like that, at all--as it doesn't meet with my own beliefs. For me, we create our reality 100% in each moment, and what is ahead of us are probabilities, freely altered by our free will and whatever we have in the pipeline at the moment.   


Are you reading professionally for money Ricotta? As in face-to-face and being out about it in the community? You sound like you have a ton of experience.   


Sorry if I'm blabbering here. I just love it when I find ""another one"". Most forums online are full of querents and void of seasoned pros.   


Thank you for taking of your time to yak with me on here."

Mediums,f4ea9y3,t3_djp3o6,1571554684.0,"Jade, if you are on Facebook, James Van Praagh's mediumship course is pretty good. It costs a pretty penny, but he does set you up with a business at the tail end of it, and personally endorses you.   


Checking into the course materials and joining his group is free, by the way. It's the only one that I'd recommend that I can think of at the moment."

I get it. Have thought like this myself; and you are so right about the world and those who peddle their wares. So right about the demand of who we must be, what we must wear, how we must act.

Nothing but cotton candy and lollipops permitted. I agree, it is fucking exhausting. Smile, or else your existence makes ""them"" uncomfortable.

I don't blame my friend, and I don't blame you for wanting to go.

But.....

With only the fake lollipop people left in the world, who's going to save it? 

I know it feels absolutely fucking overwhelming. I feel that too. 

Just remember, before it gets better it has to get worse. All the shit has to come out into the open and that is happening now.

YOU COUNT, too. ‚ù§Ô∏è You are important and you are here for a reason.

If you go, I understand; just know--not all friends are shitty jerks and not all workplaces are toxic hell-holes.
