TheCrownNetflix,f9jf07x,t3_e4vzx8,1575371123.0,"I thought she seemed ""puffy"" but I thought they were just expressing Princess Margaret's alcohol use, etc. I like the actress from the previous seasons. I mean I love HBC, but not digging her here."

She just comes across very cold and distant, which I think may be how Queen Elizabeth is in reality. The scene when Charles comes back from Wales was brutal. But the season finale with her and Margaret has me in tears."

For example, I love history especially early American history, so maybe I choose to come back in 1600s Appalachia. But idk, just a thought."

I've scheduled two appointments to start EMDR counseling and I've gotten sick (one hospital admit for severe gastritis ðŸ™„) and I worry that I'm actually afraid to get better--then what excuse do I have for bring such a loser. I really appreciate you reaching out, it feels more real than my friends and family with the pat answers and homilies."

I tried acid the other night... Not even a blip on the radar. Not a buzz, not a tingle. My son and daughter were tripping balls. Me? Nothing. What gives?"
