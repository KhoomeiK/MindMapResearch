If you have physical symptoms of anxiety or panic this is a good option. No risk of abuse or dependency (as far as I know). Been taking it as needed for a very long time

Coronavirus,fqob3e3,t1_fqnpexi,1589511327.0,"I was arguing with a ""friend"" some time ago that we could maybe stop spending billions to bomb seven or eight countries and use that money for a jobs program or social safety net: ""you wouldn't be saying that if your family member died in 9/11!"" (note: neither did theirs)

But now a 9/11 a day is going to be no big deal...until it personally impacts these types of people. The selfishness just blows my mind.

Same person said I want to see breadlines in this country because I suggested maybe more of the 2 trillion in relief should have gone to citizens and not corporations.

Another acquaintance was saying they hope the second stimulus gets killed in the Senate because ""everyone just used their money to buy TVs"" and ""(relative who also happened to be out of work) got nearly 4 grand, I just think that's excessive"".

I don't know why I'm ranting here. TL;DR I need new friends."

CovIdiots,fpq9jet,t1_fpq28oa,1588817933.0,"You make some good points I agree with. I'm not a liberal, I'm a leftist and I'm inclined to believe medical insurance and for-profit healthcare would take advantage of this situation. I don't know if it's true or not that coding things as covid related would allow them to bill more, but it seems plausible. And putting a patient on a ventilator would almost definitely increase the amount they could bill. Note that I don't think there is a grand conspiracy to either inflate or downplay the number of covid deaths for political reasons though. I would think there are a lot of covid deaths not getting classified as such as you can see in the spike in overall deaths compared to previous years.

I also don't think wearing a mask will cause you to get infected (and I wear one of I have to go to work or into a store) but I do wonder why the early consensus was that healthy people don't need to wear masks, then they changed course. I'm not a doctor but the idea that you could somehow infect yourself by wearing a mask seems absurd to me.

If you haven't seen it, check out the Vice video with Shane Smith and Ed Snowden. They talk about contact tracing and precedents for increased surveillance being set. I think that is the actual conspiracy."
