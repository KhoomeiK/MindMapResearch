slaythespire,fr371wo,t1_fr2wte3,1589851246.0,"I stand by question card not being that great, it's just 4 versus 3 card choices and provides no immediate benefit.  You'll generally find that the relics which provide no immediate benefit perform the most poorly.

>Kunai is somewhat specific to 2-3 builds, but in these builds it's insanely powerful. Getting a dex per turn is insane and claw/stance switching can consistently generate 2-3 per turn.

Which tells me that it really isn't that insane of a relic if it only performs well in niche builds.  I'm guessing you must not be talking about A20 either because those builds have hardly any consistency against time eater who you'll face 2/3 of every run.  You have to play a minimum of 3 attacks to gain 1 dex, and then you also have to play cards to block, along with any powers or draw to support getting to that 3 attack per turn situation.  At any rate, every 12 cards played will grant time eater 2 strength, and considering he has a 3 hit multi attack that equates to 6 extra damage every time you do that, you'll be hard pressed to outscale that with kunai.  Not saying it isn't impossible but if we're talking about consistently beating the game I'd rather go with any of the other relics I listed off.  Kunai is a relic at odds w/ itself in many ways, it requires a bunch of low cost attacks in your hand consistently to make use of it, but if you're doing that, aside from cloak and dagger you'll find it hard to have ample/reliable defense since you have so many attacks in your deck.

>Akabeko is good on IC and consistently low impact on everyone else.

I have to strongly disagree there, it is by far best on Silent.  Riddle with holes, flechettes, and even just plain dagger spray are all absolutely insane with akabeko.  You can delete enemies in the first 2 acts turn 1 or even just hold your first attack until you draw one of those cards.

>Smiling mask is borderline useless

Borderline useless?  Not even close.  125 gold shows me you aren't targetting enough shops / removing enough strikes.

>snecko skull pings off exactly 2 cards for more than 1 poison and neither is particularly desirabel in the first half of the run

Againwrong.  Noxious fumes, bouncing flask, envenom all ping a ton of times with this.  Crippling cloud also pings multiple if there is aoe.  And even without those sneko skull still adds a free poison to every other application.  Notice how jorbs often upgrades poisoned stab just to get only 1 more poison?  1 more poison equates to a ton of damage at all stages of the game."

The fact you can't see the irony in this statement is astounding.

Who was the one making the original claim here?  Oh right that's you.  It's on **You** to support your arguments, yet you can provide literally nothing other than ""because I say so"".

As for issues in life, just going out on a limb here but someone so insecure that they have to attack people over and over again because they are so butthurt that someone didn't agree with them - tyyypically a telltale sign of someone with issues to work through.  Keep on keepin' on buddy."

Let's put it this way, using your act 2 and beyond argument - it's pretty much always better than burning blood because outside of unupgraded defends, if you used that 1 extra energy on a block card, it is almost guaranteed to be at least 6 or greater damage blocked, so already there it's gained more value than burning blood at its floor. Then you factor in the fact that it can be the difference maker between you killing an enemy that would have hit you for 20+ damage, or playing a card like omniscience or deva form or wish which can set you up for the rest of the fight and save you far more than 6 hp... yeah it's just crushing burning blood sorry bud.  And cracked core is pretty much the most useless starting relic from act 2 and beyond, the damage it provides is almost completely irrelevant and that lightning orb gets cycled out in most decks anyway.  Playing a zap for free is definitely not as good as having a free energy on exactly the turn you need it."

Not because you keep responding over and over again with personal attacks right because a person with a life wouldn’t have time for that right?  Is this another 1nc1n phenomena where we just have to take your word on it?  

In other news 1nc1n claims 2 + 2 = 5 and the world is stunned at this new discovery.  The 1nc1n phenomena continues to shock us with new findings every day.  Back to you in the studio Bill."
leagueoflegends,fq86l9w,t1_fq85n3x,1589159541.0,"Ah so just to be clear, pick rate is relevant but only if the champ is also a jungler and we can’t use master and challenger stats.

So even though Graves has a higher pick rate and winrate in the jungle role than Lee Sin across all levels of play, Lee Sin is still the best because... because you say so?  I’m not following here."
leagueoflegends,fq85ep2,t1_fq84b58,1589158852.0,"Ah my mistake I thought we were discussing the best champion in the game, I didn’t realize ADCs weren’t allowed in the discussion - my mistake.  So I’m starting to unravel the 1nc1n code here - if I understand correctly the best champ in the game is not allowed to be an ADC because they can’t be compared to a jungler despite having higher win and pick rates across every level of play and every region.  Also, when we find out an account named exactly 1nc1n is bronze it means that isn’t an account but if you find an account with the name of the person challenging 1nc1n’s arguments, an account which hasn’t been played since season whatever it was you said - that is proof that the player indeed is bronze.

Making sure to take notes so I don’t fail the test professor.  So just to check, are top mid or support allowed to be in the discussion as well or still only a jungler can be the best champ?  Also I missed the powerpoint you gave on why Graves having a higher winrate than Lee Sin at master and challenger by over 6 percent still meant Lee Sin was the best champ in the game.  Could you send me that one oh great one?  Thanks bb! 😘"

You shut down your borders and practice social distancing until there are zero cases of covid left in your country, and as long as you keep your borders closed or extremely tightly vetted, there can’t be a second wave regardless of a vaccine.

I also love that you somehow found a random profile that isn’t me and have it buried in your mind that I’m bronze.  [Might we be projecting a little?](https://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=1nc1n)"
leagueoflegends,fq83ggz,t1_fq81c5a,1589157721.0,So Ezreal having both a higher pick rate and winrate across master+challenger than Lee Sin = not performing as well?  Damn bra you totally shut me down and owned me with facts!
TickTockManitowoc,fq7zzdx,t1_fq7x2hr,1589155695.0,"I don’t find it hard to believe at all that he’s doing time, I just don’t really think he’s the one that killed her which means the real killer will probably kill again unless it was her ex.

As for SA, the dude burned his own cat alive when he was well old enough to know better, raped his own underage cousin, broke into a bar and robbed it, beat his ex wife and girlfriends, ran a girl off the road and held her at gunpoint, amongst other things.  He’s spent around three years in prison just outside the wrongful rape conviction and questionable murder charge.  So I don’t cry myself to sleep at night that SA is behind bars, he’s a psycopath and career criminal.  The main shitty thing here is that if he didn’t do it the killer got off free.  But make no mistake SA is a real piece of shit.

Don’t let the documentary fool you about the family either.  Every single one of his siblings has done time, all of his brothers have domestic abuse and sexual assault charges and have done their own share of years in prison for them.  There is a history of real fucked up incestuous situations in that family and I find it hard to believe the parents were anything less than monsters to have created such monsters that their children became.  The  you have the next generation that clearly has some problems - what the fuck is wrong with the Dassey’s?  Lying against their own family in court, torture and death and rape porn saved their computer, that family is a nightmare.

So take that and combine it with some low IQ middle America police force and it’s not that surprising to me that they can’t get it out of their head that it’s the Avery’s that are guilty.  I mean just look how even with the DNA evidence that exonerated SA in the first case, most the people involved in convicting him were still not convinced of his innocence.  They have a bad reputation and it is well deserved."

So let’s review:

Lee Sin doesn’t have the highest play rate this patch across all players, doesn’t have the highest playrate across all time for all players, doesn’t have the highest winrate across all time for all players or the current patch, doesn’t have the highest play or winrate for challengers, and all of this is proof he is the single best champ in the history of the game.  Let’s refer to this as the /u/1nc1n phenomenon, where all other data is thrown out the window and we must simply bow down and accept the bullshit that comes out of his mouth as truth - why?  Well because he says so of course!  Flawless logic."
leagueoflegends,fq7or1j,t1_fq7lwy5,1589149255.0,"More challenger players pick Graves and win far more with him but this still equates to Lee Sin being not only the best jungler, but the single best character in the game!
