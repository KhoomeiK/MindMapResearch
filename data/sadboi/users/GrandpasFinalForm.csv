learntodraw,fldmcfr,t3_fn9838,1585067407.0,"This reply is long because it took me years to figure it out. TL; DR at the bottom. It is easier for me to explain the theory than to tell you exactly which way to angle the hand/arm. 

The best way to learn hands is to figure out how the joints bend first, then get the various bone shapes down and finally build out the flesh shapes.

The hand is basically just a 3d fan shape and the wrist only bends forward and backward. The hand can bend a little bit parallel toward the wrist bone, but that's all it can do in that direction. Once you figure out how the hand can bend from the wrist, and decide which way the wrist is going to face, you can decide how to position it. Next figure out how the fingers can bend from where your hand is facing. The thumb can only bend at kind of a diagonal and the other fingers bend straight down. They can splay a tiny bit but that's all. When you finally get those down, then you can draw the lightsaber handles. Try holding a bar-like object and note that it will lie in your hand kind of parallel to your knuckles. So you'll want the shapes in her hands to be parallel to the knuckles. If you need the lightsabers to be at that angle, I suggest drawing them first and then work backward from the fingers to the shoulder.

TL; DR: Anatomy is fundamentally about mechanics. Each bone follows from the previous joint's available moves, which follows from the previous bone. Finally, the lightsaber will follow the way the hand bends. Once you learn the way the body works, you won't need to use a picture."
learntodraw,fldk7tl,t3_fn8s8e,1585066181.0,"I really like that highlight on the eye, it makes the bird come to life. As for techniques, instead of shading with lines, try shading in tiny circular strokes starting with midtones and working your way toward dark shadows, leaving spaces and using eraser for highlights.

learntodraw,fldjrjk,t3_fnntgr,1585065932.0,"I am self-taught so this may not be the best advice. but the way I do it is to imagine what I call 'sub shapes' or the shapes of the highlights and shadows within the shape.

There will always be aspects of our lives that we cannot control. It can be helpful to think about the little things you can do something about right now. Are you taking care of yourself? Eating right and getting enough sleep and taking showers? I know they're small, but these are things you can control in your life. I don't know much about bankruptcy personally, but I do know that you can recover from it. It's natural to feel overwhelmed and helpless and even disassociated right now. There is a lot on your plate. Just because your shop idea isn't working because of the coronavirus doesn't mean it was a bad idea. And just because something doesn't work out now doesn't mean you didn't do your best. In the short term, you can try exercising small decisions to give yourself a sense of control and sanity. If the disassociation gets really bad, grounding exercises and mindfulness meditations can be helpful to get you back to the present reality.

As an adoptee I wanted to know who my birth parents were. Have you thought about how you'll handle it if the kid gets older and wants to meet you?
csMajors,eyjmacr,t3_cx8d8q,1567122429.0,"I had the same exact issue as you. I made as at community college intro courses and felt I wasn't prepared for uni level data structures. The way I see it is there's theory of computer programming and the skill of coding. School can only teach you the first one. You have to practice a lot and make mistakes to learn the second. School projects are good for getting your feet wet but nothing beats coding for fun when learning, even if you start out very small. Another poster recommended hackerrank and leetcode. Thise are excellent resources to practice using data structures to solve problems that won't consume a ton of time. There are also great video tutorials on youtube that you can use to catch up. I recommend doing some of the problems found in your java textbooks if you have them. If not, check out the book Head First Java. It's packed with exercises. When you start learning object oriented design, things will begin to fall into place and you'll start to see the bigger picture. At my university that's a junior level course though. There are a lot of students in the same boat as you so give yourself a little breathing room. Good luck in your learning!"
ADHD,exr8bvk,t3_ctuwp4,1566512695.0,sometimes I get into a funk where I just find everything boring and exhausting. is that what you're feeling? when it happens i just make myself clean the apartment or take a nap. i also set small hobby goals for myself and break down my daily tasks into microtasks. forcing myself to make small achievements is the only thing that really helps me get unstuck. i hope you feel better dude.
casualiama,exr799z,t3_ctvkk8,1566512303.0,I'm in a similar boat as you but I'm a bit older. my place is very disorganized. are there any chores you can manage or like doing?
csMajors,exr6e3q,t3_cu15fv,1566511893.0,Was it school making you miserable or CS? School requires a lot of time and money and a very specific skillset. Some people just do better learning on their own. I hope you find some answers. It took me getting my depression and adhd treated before I could return to school because it was so demanding. Good luck!
AmItheAsshole,excia56,t1_exa4kkf,1566151381.0,"OP doesn't have the right to own a business in any country as far as I'm aware. If it isn't profitable enough to cover basic necessities for his employees, he can't afford employees. Why does he deserve protections if they don't?"
AmItheAsshole,exchmap,t3_crvv6a,1566150937.0,YTA. It sounds like you can't actually afford to hire employees. Very disappointed in all of the NTA comments. Just because it's legal in your country to discriminate against her doesn't make it right or absolve you from being the asshole.

AmItheAsshole,ewvsrzy,t3_cqady1,1565813181.0,"NTA. I was abused by adoptive parents too. People who haven't experienced child abuse are out of touch with this type of situation. No one should expect a victim of child abuse to act with grace and poise and restraint. You may have stolen a ring, but they stole your entire childhood and mental health. You have been taught only how to hate and that lashing out and hurting people is ok. This makes you not the asshole. Let your anger stop here, though. It sounds like you should return to therapy to learn better ways of coping with your pain. Holding on to that anger is only going to hold you back in life and make forming new positive relationships harder. You deserve to be able to live without hate so make that choice now, that you aren't going to let them turn you into an asshole."

Advice,esmnact,t3_c8er3r,1562109647.0,"if you are at the point where you are worried about harming someone, i recommend getting out of the customer service sector at all costs and possibly seeing a therapist for anger and stress management. retail in particular is incredibly stressful and tends to bring out the worst in people. a therapist would also help you choose a direction for a new career. there are lots of techniques you can use to get your anger under control in the meantime. i recommend meditation and breathing exercises especially."
Advice,esmm908,t3_c8ernc,1562108873.0,"start by referring to women as 'women' and quit reading incel and blackpill literature. all men are real men. you need to work on respecting yourself as you currently are before you can begin to build confidence and assertiveness skills and start to change how others percieve you. because one thing successful men do is respect themselves and other people. once you begin to respect yourself, begin taking care of yourself. find something other than video games that gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment and do that thing over and over. get good at it. get to know what you like and dont like and appreciate your uniqueness. being a successful man isnt about dominance. it's about self respect and confidence and willingness to be assertive, not aggressive or passive, when conflict arises."
Advice,eslcynz,t3_c89ebz,1562083458.0,"It's not unfair of you at all to want to compromise by having a less expensive vacation if he is insisting you pay half. If the relationship is new, it's reasonable to expect to pay half but if you have been together for years and live together it is unreasonable for him to keep monetary score. That shows he has trust issues. If he keeps demanding more money from you than you can afford, it's time to share your personal budgets with each other. If sharing budgets doesn't work, rethink the relationship."

Futurology,es5me6p,t3_c5td0i,1561617664.0,Climate change is a result of overpopulation and big industry running unregulated. Pinning the financial burden on poor and middle class Americans just trying to drive to work is absurd.  Electric vehicles are very expensive to purchase and maintain for regular people. $100 is a lot of money to people trying to make ends meet and many simply don't have it. The giant corporations and billionaires in this country have the capital to make a tangible difference. They aren't helping because it isn't profitable or mandatory yet and it's cheaper to guilt individuals for using plastic straws than it is for a company to switch to a fleet of electric trucks.
Assembly_language,erefk0c,t3_c1fu8s,1560782822.0,I learned it at university and from online tutorials. I don't use it at work though.
