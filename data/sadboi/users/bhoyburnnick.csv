It would seem like people still have money to spend because (1) a lot of businesses are still keeping their employees on their payroll up until now, it's just that the salary their received during lockdown was treated as an advance on their bonuses or deducted from their available leaves (2) government paycheck and (3) many of those earning substantial income through work from home are also giving money to their less fortunate family members.

Illiquid businesses are actually the exception rather than the common. For most businesses, cash is already set side months in advance for their employees' payroll. Why? Because a labor related lawsuit on nonpayment of salary and severance pay is a bigger headache than a suit for non payment of debt.

Remember we are only two months into lockdown. It would actually be quite irresponsible for a company or business not to have at least 2-3 months of cash runway. However you should be worried about the 4th to 6th month. Once the owners see that businesses are failing despite reopening, they wont hesitate to simply close shop, cut their losses and withdraw whatever money they can salvage for their own."

Its economic impact is the one to be feared. Compared to the 1940s, the modern economy revolves around consumption beyond necessities such as restaurants or gadgets or travelling. When you remove those, you go back to a necessity-based economy. It's like transporting 100M people in 2020 to 1930 (in the sense of consumption).

Yes magnesium citrate (in the form of an orange drink powder) works wonders for me. But dont drink too much as it can cause diarrhea and excess magnesium goes into your urine, which makes urinating not so comfortable.

Magnesium citrate isnt a cure, its a temporary relief  that relaxes the muscles and the mind in my case. Probably lasts 2 hours thats why I split my dosage into three drinks a day.

For insomnia, I take melatonin, around 5mg but I take 10mg for very serious nights.

minimalism,fomw3r6,t3_g8750b,1587905663.0,"Honestly the most minimalist approach to this is to just own one phone that fully satisfies your personal and professional needs.

In terms of longevity a relatively new IPhone is your best bet since its usually given an updated OS for 4-5 years. The security of Apple ID is also great just in case you drop your phone somewhere.

The basic dumb phones arent useful at all in this day and age. Texting or making calls for example are so much more expensive than calling over Viber or Messenger. In your line of work, youll also need to use Maps, Waze, Uber, Zoom or Google."
CoronavirusRecession,fompqej,t3_g86zwy,1587899334.0,"What happens to non-impairment of contractual obligations when the state can order abatement of rent? It' practically expropriation wherein the state needs to provide just compensation to the owner.

Which is why rather than go through a nasty legal process of temporary expropriation, the state just chose to give financial aid. I think some people dont want to pay rent (and) get financial aid, which I think is a bit silly.

The non-impairment of contract and expropriation clauses in the Consitution was put there precisely because Kings and Queens used to order inn-keepers and farmers to provide VIPs like Knights free stays and produces."
CoronavirusRecession,fomoswp,t3_g6rqfj,1587898290.0,"It appears that credit card companies have taken an 180 degree turn as to their aggressiveness in offering credit cards, which is actually expected since defaults are expected in the coming months of even until next year.

Actually a major bank was aggressively pushing me to get a card last February. Told them I need to cut a few of my existing cards first. Called the representative back in March and I didnt hear from her since then.

It's not really an issue for me since I barely use my cards except for nominal food purchases, but now I understand what my college professor said that most banks would leave you dry in times of crisis."
simpleliving,fo29nqw,t1_fo28zo0,1587454290.0,I enjoy travelling and dining out as well. However looking back maybe I should have scaled down on both a little bit. I don't know how long will this crisis be or how my finances are going to look in the next months or even years. My friends share the same sentiments during this crisis.
iphone,fo1tw7s,t3_g2unhy,1587441415.0,"I switched from the Blackberry Keyone to an IPhone 7 Plus.

Pros of switching to iOS:

1. iOS has at least 4 years of updates. Look, the IPhone SE which was released in 2016 is stil being supported.

2. Apple processors are blazing fast, and usually remain blazing fast even throughout the years. Capacity is also astonishing. 

3. While not infalliable, Iphones are generally secure. Android security varies depending on the manufacturer.

Cons:

1. The lightning port is terribly annoying. Borrowing someone else' charger in times of emergency can be challenging or a broken cord is expensive. 

2. You're losing Samsung Dex if you transfer to an Iphone which imho is a feature worth keeping. I wouldnt transfer to an Iphone if I had an S9 or S10 for Dex.

3. Connectin Iphone to a windows PC isnt so smooth, compared to an Android.

4. S9 to Iphone SE 2 is a major downgrade. A small screen to be honest is only good in your head but youll realize its downsides once you use it on a daily basis. Its difficult to type, cant see words on apps clearly, cant watch movies decently, and battery life is terrible.

Verdict: Youre in a good spot with your S9. If youre going to upgrade, better upgrade to the Iphone 11 at the very least, but that may not be considered a significant upgrade in yoir case."
iphone,fnzxiyk,t3_g3ck47,1587402464.0,"I think this is a phone meant for people who are still holding on to their Iphone 7 and older, in order to avoid them from buying a second hand iphone or switch to android altogether.

Current android users seem unlikely to change to this. Frankly the only thing going on for the SE is the A13 bionic which only Apple lovers appreciate. Theres too much value proposition in the Android market at a 400$ pricepoint in so far as cameras, screens, speakers and size are concerned.

It would be nice to have an SE plus though. I use a 7 Plus and there doesnt seem to have any advantage for me to upgrade to an SE. An SE Plus having the same battery life as the Iphone 11? Id buy it asap"
antiwork,fnzo9us,t3_g4bhmo,1587397805.0,"Money is just a magnifying glass.

If you're already a generally happy person, it makes you happier because you have more means at your disposal to share your happiness with others. 

If you're already depressed at the outset, it just makes your depression worse because you see a lot of problems in your life which can't be solved with money and which doesnt seem to have any solution.

The theory that happiness doesnt increase after a certain level of income is true. The way I see it, the optimal lifestyle is the lifestyle you had when you were happy. For example, the happiest point in your life may probably be your college years wherein eating at Fridays or Chilis was already a treat. Even of you earn say $500k/month, into adulthood youd probably still feel the same happiness when you dine at Fridays or Chilis. Eating at a three star michelin star probably wont increase your happiness by fourfold or fivefold. Rather, you'll start craving for something which you lacked in childhood, be it a best friend or acceptane in a community or a family etc.

At least, thats how I see it and how I experienced it."
restaurants,fnzk422,t3_fto3h2,1587395602.0,"No, for the following reasons:

1. Social distancing will have a severe financial impact on businesses with limited dining space. At the very least, given the same area you'd be only operating at half capacity. This alone would probably be a breaking point fot most restaurants.

2. That's the least of the problems. Restaurants which have a sharing setup such as hotpots, asian grills or even buffets will have severe difficulty attracting patrons at the outset.

3. Diminished disposable income is very much expected. Not only is general personal income decreased on average, a lot of people have taken on debt which will take months if not years to pay. Also, this is an unprecedented event which strongly reminded people to save because they cannot fully rely on the government when they dont have any savings. People arent suddenly going to drop $20 on a burger when they had difficulty paying for rent last month.

You can lift the lockdown when cases are decreasing but as long as theres no vaccine, I doubt consumer attitude would suddenly change. 

What's the future? Someone has to provide fresh and healthy meals to the thousands of office workers who will still go to work, at a low cost. It would be volume based catering. These office workers can't keep on buying fast food, and not all can pack lunch from home."
witcher,fnvdgga,t3_g44o73,1587289153.0,imho any storyline that concerns Ciri is boring. Bonhart is even more interesting that Ciri.
witcher,fnvci2b,t3_g3img9,1587288111.0,"Her character aside, her wedding quest was one of the most memorable and immersive quests in W3. I remember playing throught it for around 2 hrs and feeling as if I really went on a great date. The fact that youre accompanying a ghost who just wants to enjoy life again reminds you to appreciate the little pleasures of life."
witcher,fnvc5hx,t3_g421ng,1587287741.0,"I'd like to see them make a game on the original Order of the Witchers, and their eventual spinoff into several schools.

It would also be nice if you can control more than one character like in Final Fantasy."
gwent,fnovsk9,t3_g333tf,1587134544.0,"From my point of view classic Gwent is better off as a stand alone deckbuilding board game (like Dungeon Mayhem) instead of a collectibe card game like Magic.

Of course Gwent right now is, in competitive terms, better than classic Gwent. But still, classic Gwent has that charm where you dont feel that annoyed when you lose."
gwent,fnhvuuz,t3_g19pk8,1586969716.0,Still pretty great despite being reduced to 2 coins. I have always found myself in excess of coins anyway. 2 coins is still well enough to kickstart peach engine as soon as possible.
gwent,fn8yrpn,t3_fzz4ge,1586753988.0,"Syndicate coins are the equivalent of ""counters"" in Magic. It's not mana per se but quasi-mana considering that it introduces some tempo aspect in the game.

The absence of mana and the presence of coins in Gwent is a well-thought compromise when you hate the mana system and you still want to implement some tempo in the game.

I'm quite certain Gwent will eventually evolve into a game adopting mechanics such as drain, milling, discard, cascade, ascend, devotion etc or even dice rolls. After all you can only do so much with cards, dice and coins. The only thing imporant is that the core principles of the game remain"
gwent,fn6zk9x,t1_fn6x0lf,1586710407.0,"I understand where you're coming from. WOTC spends tens of thousands of hours playtesting their sets yet they still ban cards frequently (even in Standard).

With factions in place, I hope Gwent doesnt reach a point where it will frequently change a card's stats and abilities just to balance the game."
elderscrollslegends,fn6yl5w,t3_fx59xj,1586709875.0,"Among all digital card games ESL was my favorite. It was simply the best of both MTG and Hearthstone combined. 

If you're willing to take some additional depth into your gane, MTG is really the way to go. Played MTG since its early days in the 90s and until now I still think its the best TCG. Many players hate the mana/land aspect of it for possible drought, but the fact is it adds a new dimension to the game (tempo). The biggest mistake MTG made was that it didnt release something like MTG Arena back in 2015.

Too bad younger players probably wont be able to play MTG in its tabletop version much. MTG tabletop was the most cost-effective TCG. You can purchase a card for $20 and still sell it for $15 after a year of playing. In formats like Modern, playing is practically free since the resale value is close to 100%. Resale is completely abolished in these digital games.

Hearthstone, I played for a while, it's alright but you'll spend as much on it as MTG (if not more). At this point its just a matter of preference, whether you like a game with simpler mechanics or a more complex one.

Gwent is the friendliest and the most enjoyable game for F2P players. Each deck only has 25 cards, with 1 max copy for gold cards and 2 max copies for bronze cards. There's no mana as well, which results in a fast paced game every game. I found the mechanics weird as well, but then I realized the game replaced mana tempo with timing and foresight (like blackjack)."
gwent,fn6vkvx,t3_fzz4ge,1586708204.0,"MTG started out similarly with their manas. Each color represented a different play style. Eventually, MTG created two color cards and three color cards. That completely changed the game, which is why you rarely see mono-color decks in T1 MTG.

At some point the game has to evolve, the question is which path is better to take? Adding more factions (discard factions, counter factions) or removing factions altogether allowing players to find their own playstyle and combos?"
