Obviously the actors are much older, so you have to remember that they’re just 16/17 and still really naive, especially in such overwhelming situations. As a 15 nearly 16 year old myself, I thought the show and script did an amazing job of accurately capturing the way they’d speak and behave, and I don’t think John b telling Sarah was a strange thing for a 16 year old to do.

OuterBanksNetflix,fptxl9g,t1_fptiewy,1588900307.0,"I said above- I think it was this thread- that while the first kiss was wrong, as soon as it happened- and even before- it was very clear that Sarah was planning on breaking up with Topper, by the time she first kissed John b, that decision was already made.

What Sarah did wasn’t a big deal at all. Sarah didn’t invite Kiara to one party, and instead of being hurt or angry and talking to Sarah about why she wasn’t invited, she called the cops on the party- that isn’t a normal reaction. Sure, Sarah saying it’s was Kie who snitched ostracised her, but that wasn’t Sarah’s fault. If Kiara didn’t want to be hated by the entirety of the kooks, she wouldn’t have snitched on the party and risked any of their college acceptances or scholarships. Kiara snitched, all the kooks not liking her because of that is HER fault, Sarah wasn’t in the wrong fir simply saying it was Kie.

And what you said wasn’t right at all. John b worked on Sarah’s families boat, so they most likely saw each other everyday, and this would be happening for months or even a couple years, which is why at the start of the show, they already have quite a deep rooted flirtation and feelings for each other that they aren’t aware of because they’ve not yet had any reason or chance to rise to the surface- seen by the way they talk and look at each other.

And at least Sarah had an apology when Kiara was equally (or, in my option, more so) in the wrong, whereas Kiara didn’t even apologise (if I’m remembering correctly) and just tried to laugh it off."
OuterBanksNetflix,fprsmh8,t1_fprrfcf,1588861245.0,"Sarah called Kiara a ‘shit talking bitch’ after sitting there for ages listening to Kiara moaning and bitching about Sarah being there, of course she’s gonna be hurt and mad and snap at Kiara, but after that one instance when she snapped because she couldn’t handle Kie belittling and complaining about her, she constantly tried to be civil and talk and laugh.

Kiara ALWAYS brought up how much she hated Sarah, even when they went into the house- without Sarah- and couldn’t find anything, she blamed Sarah for it when she wasn’t even there. She also told them that she was gonna steal all the gold from them which literally make any sense because the only thing Sarah did to make them fall out was not invite her to a party and make it known that it was Kiara who called the cops (which most likely came out when she was drunk from the party anyway.) Plus Kiara constantly complained about Sarah being a kook even though she herself is one lmao.

I never said saving mice was a personality trait, just that the majority of the time, those who care deeply about the lives and wellbeing of animals are much more empathetic (yes there’s exceptions but there is for everything.)

 You can think that but it doesn’t mean it’s true. As a straight girl, Sarah’s looks couldn’t mean less to me when it comes to my feelings for her character. She was never stuck up to me, she always tried to stop the pogues and kooks fighting and help people.

I already said cheating wasn’t okay, and she should have ignored her dad and broken up with him, but I understand why she felt like she couldn’t given how overwhelming kook life would be and how it comes with needing to have good appearances, which would include showing up with a kook boyfriend."

I disagree. She only felt trapped when she felt as if people had gotten too close, which is also why she could never sleep with anyone, but that was different with John b, so while she might worry about him leaving her if it is abandonment issues she struggles with, her worrying about being trapped because they’re too close doesn’t really exist anymore because she’s already as close to him as she can be (in the way she sees it.)

Yikes- Kiara is technically a kook yet she’s a pogue. Sarah always found the pogue vs kook war thing ridiculous, she deserves to be part of the pogues."

OuterBanksNetflix,fpp1933,t1_fpk34w1,1588794200.0,"OMG YES- Kiara was so petty and childish about it. They fell out somewhere between the 8th and 9th grade, so they were anywhere between 13-15, so it had been multiple years since they fell out, yet every time they saw Sarah, Kiara CONSTANTLY made snarky comments towards her and called her a bitch while Sarah just got on with her life and was friendly to both pogues and kooks. Even on the boat, Sarah was trying to be civil and even play ‘would you rather’ and Kiara was just being bitchy, getting irritated every time Sarah opened her mouth and making fun of her never smoking weed before."
OuterBanksNetflix,fpp0po8,t1_fpj7iao,1588793932.0,"I think the thing is, yes, it’s in four days, but what they were experiencing wasn’t normal life, same as how if the world was ending, you’d probably fall love a lot quicker because there are more huge and emotional events going on that bring you closer. What I mean by this is, John b worked on Sarah’s boat and saw her around probably every day, and the way he looks at her- even at the beach with Topper in the first episode- and the way they talk to each other hints that there’s always been a little flirtation and attraction here and there, just nothing they’ve ever really fully acknowledged. When they spent the day together, those possible years of attraction came to the surface which is why they had their first kiss so soon, it had been months or years in the waiting.

Then, Sarah had to experience thinking John was going to die or had died when he was pushed from the crows nest, and even a split second of thinking you’ve lost someone makes you aware of how deep your feeling for them are. After that, John b lived in her house, making them even closer while they dealt with all the excitement of finding the gold (which isn’t exactly a ‘normal’ thing and was definitely a factor in why they were so close.)

John b was also standing up for Sarah to Topper and her family- which she saw- which made her feel much more comfortable and connected to John b, bringing them closer. Because of all this, she finally lost her virginity to him, something that in her experience would completely amplify her feelings for him and he was the first guy she’d ever fully trusted and helped her get over her abandonment issues.

Then they both saw Peterkin get shot and killed together, a traumatic event that would have brought them incredibly close because they could rely on and seek comfort in each other as they were both there- again, not a normal situation. Even more so, Sarah had to deal with learning her father AND brother were killers and could only find comfort in John b, whom she was hiding and running from the police with.

Everything that was happening was so unnaturally and overwhelming that it completely makes sense why they fell so hard so fast, they were each other’s only constant (definitely Sarah’s, John b also had the pogues I guess, but was only hiding away with Sarah) in a crazy, crazy situation."
OuterBanksNetflix,fpoz700,t3_gcaurt,1588793184.0,"I have to disagree. From the very start, Sarah came across empathetic and sweet to me. After storm Agatha, instead of complaining about WiFi like Wheezie, Sarah was trying to save the mice, creatures whom most just confused vermin, and when her father called her over to talk to Scooter’s wife and she realised that scooter might have been hurt/dead, she was so instantly empathetic with his wife and wanted to help.

She also was against the whole pogues vs kooks thing and thought the entire thing was ridiculous and always tried to treat the pogues the same and kept John b’s secret of borrowing the scuba gear. The only time she was bitchy to them was after John B wrongfully accused her, but instead of allowing him to hate her and a rivalry to stay or worsen, she went to him to explain that it wasn’t her, and tried to make light of the situation by throwing him the same crisps he knocked out of her hands.

When it came to joining the pogues, Sarah was much more mature than Kiara (and even before then, she got on with her life away while Kiara constantly made rude and petty remarks) and just tried to get along and fix their relationship. She went with John b to see everyone because that’s what he wanted, even though she rightfully though that Kiara wouldn’t be happy with it.

The only thing I think Sarah did wrong was cheat, but John b was also a part of that, and straight after her day with John b and first kiss with him, she wanted to break up with Topper but her dad pressured her into staying with him for the midsommar party. I think she could have handled it better with Topper when he caught them, but he did treat her awfully and call her horrid names."

As for the pedophilia, in England, the of age of consent is 16, and then you can be with anyone- including 18 year olds and older. In Italy (at the time, I don’t know if it still is) the age of consent was 14.

2. It was an editing group, so I sort of ‘won’ my way in and chose to just hack it out, because the more groups you’re in, the more recognition you get. I was planning on eventually just leaving when it got too much but when they started obviously being rude to me and not just through subtle comments, I wasn’t just not going to say anything in return and leave like a ‘coward’ as I’m sure they would have assumed."

callmebyyourname,fo040yl,t1_fo014p8,1587405697.0,"I do get what you’re saying, but it seemed like he possibly ‘came out’ to Elio in order to explain why he was saying and assuming the things he was about Elio and Oliver’s relationship, as he says a line about explaining himself (I don’t remember exactly and don’t want to miss-quote) directly before talking about him not being brave enough himself.

Aciman said himself that while in the books, Mr. Perlman’s sexuality isn’t explored at all and that for can’t really be questioned, but that the movie purposefully used and wrote that scene in a way that it could quite easily be inferred that he is indeed coming out.

I think it’s all down to personal perception and that’s just my take on it, I totally understand you’re own, I just disagree :)"
callmebyyourname,fnzzvem,t1_fnzzap4,1587403630.0,"Also, Aciman didn’t intend for it to be that way in the books, but said that taking it away from the movie can be a correct assumption- as well as assuming he’s just straight- so I see him as bisexual :)"
callmebyyourname,fnzzkp5,t1_fnzzap4,1587403485.0,"Well yeah- I’d stick up for them too- but he seemed to do so in a way that made him appear personally offended.

I really have to disagree, and that’s why Elio asks ‘does mum know?’ and he says he doesn’t think so. It couldn’t have bene about Elio and Oliver’s relationship because the mother knew before the father did, and made it quite clear to him (Elio’s father.)"
callmebyyourname,fnzyflp,t1_fnzych5,1587402917.0,"^^^ Exactly- so I’m confused lol, I thought it was purposefully blatantly clear?"
callmebyyourname,fnzx8nu,t1_fnzx2in,1587402323.0,"About him being gay/bisexual? The dad made it really obvious in his speech, his support of Elio and how offended he is by Elio and his mum ‘making fun’ of the gay visitors"
callmebyyourname,fnzvevd,t1_fnzrf5u,1587401426.0,"I think Elio was asking if his mum knew that his dad was gay/bisexual, not about Elio and Oliver being together :)"
