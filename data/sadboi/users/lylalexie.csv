That being said, I do have a slightly different viewpoint. There‚Äôs a quote I love from Joan Rivers that sums up my feelings regarding the lifelong struggle us people with depression go through. 

‚ÄúListen. I wish I could tell you it gets better, but...it doesn't get better. YOU get better.‚Äú 

I take this to mean, depression doesn‚Äôt change or get better throughout our lives, but over time we develop better tools for how to deal with it. We gain new coping mechanisms and create better habits, and each time we go through a low point in our cycle of depression, we learn a little bit more about ourselves. That way, the next time our depression comes back to try and kick our asses, we are better equipped to tell it to go fuck off. 

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs not the same type of positivity as ‚Äúthis too shall pass‚Äù or ‚Äúit will get better‚Äù, but thinking of it this way In the past has really helped, for me at least."

TwoXChromosomes,erb8ykt,t3_c140tg,1560666978.0,"It took me until age 23 to have an orgasm. I had been in a similar situation that you‚Äôre currently in and made a few changes that ended up making all the difference. 

May I ask what antidepressant you‚Äôre on? SSRI‚Äôs like Zoloft or Prozac can make it nearly impossible to have an orgasm even on low doses. I had been on between 50-100mg Zoloft for years, and mentioned my issues to my doctor. She gradually transitioned me from Zoloft to Wellbutrin, which doesn‚Äôt have those negative sexual side effects (some people who take it say it actually makes it easier to orgasm). 

In addition to  changing antidepressants, I bought a vibrator. It was one of those cheap, simple vibrators with no extra frills. I could change the strength of the vibration and that was it. Those two things together really helped a lot. I found my sex drive went up and I began experimenting with my vibrator, particularly placement and the angle that seemed to feel best. 

Now, the last thing I did really wasn‚Äôt essential to having an orgasm, but it did make them more intense. I got a VCH (vertical clitoral hood) piercing. Kind of weird, but it‚Äôs by far my favorite piercing. It sits right on top of the clitoris and helps increase the sensation from the vibrator, then focuses it directly where I need it to go! It also healed in record time, maybe a couple weeks max. 

As far as dryness, you could definitely try using lube before having sex. A little goes a long way. Both birth control and antidepressants can affect your ability to get turned on (it kind of dulls your sex drive and sensation), so it makes sense that you don‚Äôt get very wet down there. 

I think with a little trial and error, you could definitely get where you want to go. Don‚Äôt give up! You deserve to experience amazing orgasms, and when that finally happens it will be SO worth the wait! :-)"

AskReddit,erb2hpu,t3_c15ja3,1560659323.0,"I grew up extremely religious and conservative, and it took me until age 27 to realize I was following a religion that directly contradicted the book it claimed to view as the literal and holy word of God. I couldn‚Äôt understand why Christians would quote passages of the Bible that talk about unconditional love for everyone, love your brother as you love yourself, turn the other cheek, whoever cares for the least of these cares for Jesus himself, type stuff...then turn around and say derogatory, hurtful, and sometimes violent things about people from other backgrounds and faiths. 

I think the final straw for me was when I had an argument with my mother about the US involvement in the Middle East. She said she agreed with our infamous president about needing to bomb, shoot, and kill the children and family members of potential terrorists even though they may be innocent. I was horrified that someone who had been a loving mother to two children (and who had taught us that Jesus loved the whole world so much, he died so we could be with him in heaven) could say such a terrible thing. 

I am not sure if I still believe in a god or not. I‚Äôd prefer to believe in the god I learned about, who loves and cares about every person no matter their situation, but lately I‚Äôve been thinking that‚Äôs just a pipe dream. I‚Äôve been doing more research into the scientific theories about our universe and where it could have come from, and it just makes so much more sense than what I was taught. The sheer amount of info is overwhelming, but helpful. I now know there was a TON of facts and education I didn‚Äôt receive from my parents (I was homeschooled) about the world and what lies beyond it, and it‚Äôs disillusioned me from Christianity even further. 

I‚Äôve kind of resigned myself to the fact that I will probably never really know what‚Äôs true and what isn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôm coming to terms with it. Ive turned my attention towards brushing up on my scientific knowledge and relearning the things I was incorrectly taught.
