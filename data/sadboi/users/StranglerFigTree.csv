CPTSD,fq2fleo,t1_fq1cl3l,1589055665.0,I completely understand. I can still only do it sometimes. I think it gets a little realer to me each time I can grasp that image for myself. I wish you whatever peace and relief you can find. Thank you for your response! I am rooting for you.

CPTSD,fpuxbfp,t3_gfcy7n,1588927008.0,"Oh, my friend. I wish I was able to be more coherent right now because you deserve all of the genuine encouragement in the world. Please just know that I wholeheartedly second what the others have said and I am sending you all the love and empathy. I want you to continue to live. Sometimes when I have been very seriously suicidal I have imagined my future self as an alive and fulfilled person (I don't try to do more than that vague image, because it seems impossible) looking back on the current unbearable moment/time period and being overwhelmingly proud of myself and feeling compassion and disbelief that I somehow made it through. Because I know that is what will happen eventually if I keep going. I have no idea if that could mean anything to anyone else, but sometimes it is the randomest and smallest thing that can keep me going when I would really rather not.

Sending a virtual hug, if you would want one."

I am just being re-exposed to the longitudinal gaslighting of the twisted family system as I learn how to establish actual boundaries beyond distance and hiding.
