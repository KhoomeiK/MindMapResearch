BroomClosetWitch,fi5yahb,t1_fi4vkir,1582173458.0,"I've been on the fence with my views for most of my life. Raised Catholic. Since early childhood, I've had a deep longing for something more that I couldn't put my finger on. I recently went back to the church after a very difficult time in my life. I can't stand behind many of the close-minded views of the church. I also dislike how I'm not allowed to question my faith. Now I'm back here. I am still learning who I am. After reading the bible as an adult (and now as a mother), I have trouble continuing down the path of organized religion. I wholly agree with your comment speaking from personal experience. It's hard to see any other view when you're in it and you don't realize how damaging it can be to others."

Every time I see her she asks me to host a party. I have never once expressed interest at all. I hate parties where friends and family are expected to buy something. That is not a party in my eyes.

Hell, I'd even love a new vacuum that ISN'T a robot and I would have felt the same way when I was childless and had a career. I usually ask for practical things that I need. I don't need the extravagant gifts a lot of people seem to fantasize about. Maybe I'm just frugal but I would never be offended by someone giving me any sort of gift. How would you feel if she bought you a lawn mower or a snow blower? I'm almost certain my husband would shit his pants in ecstatic joy."

Health? Find something that makes you happy and go all out! Family is most important to me so I'm really focusing on that. I've also been doing a lot of reading and thinking about rejoining my childhood church again. Maybe volunteer to find a group that you relate to.

It took me a very long time to work up the courage to get a referral from my doctor and actually make the call to set it up. They couldn't see me until November 12th. November 12th finally rolled around and I woke up nervous and excited. My husband rushed home from work so he could watch our son while I went to the appointment. I checked my phone to see I had a missed call and a voicemail from the office. To my surprise, the appointment was canceled due to a ""scheduling conflict."" I was pretty bummed but figured I'd reschedule for a date within the next few weeks since they were the ones that canceled my appointment in the first place. Surely they'd squeeze me in after waiting 3 months, right? When I called back, the scheduler said there are no available spots and they no longer schedule more than 45 days out. The scheduler was rude to me and could hear that I was holding back tears. I hung up the phone and broke down. That is the moment I realized I really needed help and I couldn't wait any longer. I am still upset thinking about it. I haven't scheduled anything yet and I'm honestly feeling discouraged. I am trying to get to the bottom of my issues on my own now."
BreakUps,fabiojo,t3_e80h6k,1575923819.0,It sounds like his intentions were good from the start but his feelings changed. That's what dating is all about. Just because someone has a change of heart doesn't mean they are a bad person. I know it's hard to see right now because you are heartbroken but at least he is being honest. It's better that he broke up with you now if he isn't feeling it rather than stringing you along.

After it was over I promised myself I'd never go through it again. It lasted around 2 weeks. I has night sweats, insomnia, awful headaches, extreme irritability.

I used to smoke a lot more but I got pregnant so I quit for over a year and a half but then I started again as a ""light smoker."" I quit when I was pregnant for the baby but this time I quit for me and I'm feeling so much better about it. Cigarettes are so dang expensive if you're buying them pre-rolled. I bought a bag of tobacco and a box of tubes so I was only spending $30 or so per month. It would have been roughly $140 a month had I purchased pre-rolled cigarettes."

I tend to get bad cravings again right around this time and I have been a lot lately but I'm working through it. I feel the cravings dwindling again. Just keep busy when you want a smoke and remind yourself how far you've come and how much it will suck to start over again. Giving in won't make you feel good and it's not worth it. The time I quit before now I was at a party with other smokers and said I'd have ""just one."" One will not satisfy! I also had a terrible throat ache for 2 days."

It is inspiring to know there are others who took the dark path before finding the light. I am so grateful my mom insisted I attend church because otherwise I doubt I'd have that warning in the back of my head telling me this isn't right.

I think messenger would be ok if you kept it strictly for communication but that's your own personal choice. I am older and use texting as my main source of communication so I'm not missing anything from messenger besides pushy messages from old high school acquaintances selling crap. The important thing is you recognize the problem and you're taking the steps to make your situation better. Good luck to you.

After just one week I'm feeling less anxious and more content in my life. I deleted all social media aside from Reddit which I check maybe once a day. I try to replace my old scrolling time by reading a paperback book, going outside or writing in a journal. I don't have much of a social circle anymore but I'm happy to no longer be bombarded with MLM invites. I figured if they are my true friend they will still invite me to an event via text."
