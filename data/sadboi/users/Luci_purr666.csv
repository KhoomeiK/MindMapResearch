grilledcheese,fk0vmah,t1_fk0oq0e,1583767142.0,Right?? I never thought about it either until I saw a friend do it! Salt and pepper made it taste so much better. Who knew?
grilledcheese,fk0h6vh,t1_fk0bn6r,1583756835.0,"It actually doesn't! I thought that it would when I first tried it. As long as the grilled cheese is crispy on the outside, it won't stick. The paper towel just absorbs any excess moisture from condensation."

EatingDisorders,f6wa7yv,t3_dtdv76,1573221358.0,"Be careful when you go to a medical doctor. They are often not educated on EDs, which can pose a lot of anxiety/invalidation towards the client/patient. I would recommend seeing an ED informed doctor (if there are any in your area), get labs drawn, see an ED therapist, an ED dietitian, and a psychiatrist. As an ED therapist myself, I would be more than happy to give you recommendations on providers in your area if you would like. Taking this next step is so hard, but it is worth it."
EatingDisorders,f6w8b48,t3_dtdus2,1573219765.0,"Do you have an ED therapist or have you considered going to treatment? ED cycles are SO hard to break, and one good thing about treatment is they can literally help with meal plan and balance with food (as well as therapy)."

AskReddit,f6gdukx,t1_f6g4v92,1572824761.0,"As my experience as a therapist (and someone who personally experiences anxiety), anxiety exists as a means of safety (generally), such as: ""I'm anxious, so staying away from things that make me anxious ""prevent"" bad things."" Faulty thinking because anxiety doesn't really help, but we feel like it does. That's where emotional mind and rational mind differ. With obsessive thoughts, they typically exist for the same reason. Since I don't know what yours is, I'll use an example: ""If I constantly wash my hands, I can ""prevent"" myself from getting sick and have control."" Again, faulty thinking here; rational mind tells us that this is incorrect, but emotional mind is all about it. I don't have any sources to refer to, just something that has made sense to me in my practice."
AskReddit,f6fgr5b,t3_dr07vm,1572814181.0,"Most maladaptive things that people get stuck in likely saved their life at some point. Most humans don't do things to hurt themselves intentionally. Examples: self harm may keep someone from attempting suicide to reduce pain or shift emotional pain to physical pain, which may be more ""manageable;"" someone with an eating disorder likely developed it to cope with intensive trauma or feelings of a loss of control in their life; someone's anxiety feels like it can them ""safe"" from being hurt.
Seeing people through this lens helps me never get frustrated with people because they are doing what they had to do to survive. Either consciously or unconsciously, it makes sense."
