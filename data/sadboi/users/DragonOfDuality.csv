Imo the main problem is just that between technology and outsourcing the economy grew in a way no one who came up with this system could have expected.

In the 50's a factory mechanic or someone with computer knowledge was not just rare but also in house and vital to growing a dependable way to feed such a large population.

Service jobs were still largely held by families that owned the business and had more to gain than an hourly salary. It's not that way now.

The skills of workers outgrew the number of skilled jobs and the average service workers having a true stake in the business has been taken over by mega corporations."
atlanticdiscussions,fqhub8g,t3_gj06vn,1589384719.0,"The job itself is a commodity.

It's a philosophy issue. Employees are commodities, the job is a commodity. You exchange one commodity for another. Desirable commodities are only traded for desirable commodities.

There's nothing essential about a commodity. Or rather there's nothing essential about holding onto a commodity.

They're viewed as expendable, even when they're not, because they're considered to have low desirability. Low value. 

Because modern capitalism is largely grown on wants, not needs. Good work that needs to be done doesn't hold a candle to work that wants to be done.

A few laws about what is and is not a requirement for society to run and rights, restrictions, and privileges around that would stop the capitalistic thinking of everything being a commodity that must be sold. We already have laws that effect water and certain utilities to a degree. All we have to do is expand them further into more industries that we have proven are just as, if not more, vital to our society.

But the biggest problem I see is that the government itself has adopted the philosophy of viewing everything as a commodity. And it's probably been that way since the red scare. If not before. ... there was just a few steps that required it to encompass everything."

leagueoflegends,fqb4wzk,t1_fq9j47d,1589230640.0,"Since passive seems to be the thing that people think makes Mao win and they've changed it some over the years:

>Sap Magic  **30 / 25 / 20 (BASED ON LEVEL)**   
>  
>Each time Maokai casts an ability or is struck by an enemy's ability, Sap Magic's Cooldown reduction icon cooldown is reduced by 4 seconds

\*(Not saying you don't know this, just throwing it out for those that don't. I play Mao and wasn't sure of the exact timing because, again, they've changed it over the years.)   
If Mao gets hit by all Aatrox's abilities (probably not something you want to do but OK) and uses all his he gets a full reset in 1 rotation. And a 4 second reduction for the next. (A 300hp heal per passive if Mao is level 11 and has 3000 hp.) But then he has to wait on his own CDs and Aatrox's.

That starts going into some more complicated math I can't get more than a general idea of. It also depends alot on their own CDRs.   Just the fact that Aatrox can constantly heal after he gets DD makes me favor him.

Personally I think if Mao wins in a strict 1v1 scenario it's just because of his tankiness and not outhealing by any means. Though the sustain helps ofc.

&#x200B;

Though I think it's hard to imagine who wins because a few items in they'll be brawling long enough for someone to certainly intervene or for one to have to back off to contest baron/save towers/ect.

leagueoflegends,fqaog7t,t1_fqal45s,1589222525.0,"I think he would reasonably expect to get it in about 5+ seconds in a 1v1 situation. Depending on level.

The cd goes down only if he is struck by enemy spells. And in a 1v1 you wouldn't really want to be struck by every single ability the enemy can put out. And Aatrox has cooldowns too. Not long ones but they're there. And Aatrox can heal on plain old auto attacks.

Mao passive is a big heal if he has SV that he can use relatively frequently. But Aatrox has 2 healing abilities with a huge buff with his ult + he builds death's dance and frequently SV as well.

Mao is strong, I'm not arguing that, I just think it's stretch to say he outheals... one of the best self healing champions in the game."

You could expect maybe a half hearted appearance from either jungle in that entire time and no one expected you to do anything else but 1v1 your enemy top and keep them busy (not let them push and, ideally, push yourself.)

Often as not laning phase only ended when one top laner started pushing into inhib tower.

If you killed an over fed top laner it was because you outplayed them (or they got stupid, which is just as rewarding imo.) And you were the one that fed them.

It's always a case of weighing your risks. Obviously you don't always 100% of the time want to go with your teams' ideas. And sometimes they will listen to you. It's all situational.

Point was I just see alot of smurfs that can't adapt to the fact that low elo is a different animal. 

Though I think maybe part of the issue in this discussion is how you define ""low elo."" Iron/Bronze is much more of a clown fiesta than Gold. And people afk/dc more often there and you can plan for things like that.  

But most plat/diamond strats can work in Gold if you get semi-cooperative people on your team.

I understand that it is VERY frustrating to work with people who are very much more ignorant than you. It's why I only sparingly smurf these days and almost exclusively do it with friends. I think that could apply to anything in life though. Competing with people who are very much below your level can be fun but working with people who aren't often isn't.

If there's a bad baron call but the team is determined to try it then go with them. Worst case scenario is you do some damage before you get out and recall. Or die.

Best case scenario is the enemy team doesn't capitalize on the bad call (because they're not very good either) and you get baron, a pentakill, and win the game.

But if you didn't go with them the best you could hope for is to get an inhib or something before you get to try to solo defend or out push 5 people.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've seen it alot where better players resist what's going on in lower elos and it only costs them. The hardest thing about smurfing is adjusting your playstyle around people (ally and enemy) that don't know as you do. You might know that tank support Ashe shouldn't exist, but they might not. So you focus her Vayne over Ashe. You might know that it's a terrible time for the enemy jungle to gank. But they might not. So you should be prepared for Rengar to pop out of a bush.

Low elo, especially very low elo, just doesn't have the same rules higher elo players are used to. Yes the lower players are wrong... but you're also wrong for not adapting yourself to that environment."

Was happy to see shelters roped off. Even in a crisis where people are absolutely dying to get out they still find it hard to walk more than 100 yards from their car.

Sorry if that's a bit disdainful but it's a long story about how the parks almost died until they all built pools so people could drive out to tiny preserves of nature, not really observe it, be loud as shit, and throw their trash in the creek. I can't stand alot of our beautiful state parks in summer because you can hear the pool, literally, across mountains.

School was always difficult for me up till high school so I dunno why I got that in my head for more advanced science. But I eventually realized that if God didn't want us to understand it he wouldn't have made us capable of understanding it.

And indeed there are some things in quantum physics and particle physics that seem beyond human comprehension. But high school biology is a far step from that.

I learned to incorporate my faith with science. I'm happy to say that I know few Christians who can't come to terms with dinosaurs and the creator. Though the revival of hard faith born of fear with pastors preaching this shit has definitely picked up."

Inflation is countered by deflation.

Things can't grow indefinitely.

With things that come crashing down we have a chance to rebuild. I'm hoping we take the opportunity to focus on creating work where it needs to be and not where it can market manipulate a profit.

I've seen someone do almost this exact thing and sent them a pm. I was like the similarities between the works are really too similar and I don't want people to get confused, can you change the character names?

I don't want to discourage anyone from writing and I'm skilled enough and work hard enough that I think my writing speaks for itself but the message was well received. They changed the names and then took the fic off in a totally different direction.

I was okay with that. Sometimes fanfiction becomes fanfiction of other fics."

I still want to cry.

Thank god for this country and this age we live in and all the absolutely wonderful people that are keeping things going right now.

Honestly this is something people with chronic illness have been facing forever and will forever.

The ADA was enacted because before then people largely dismissed inaccessibility because it would be too expensive and inconvenient for people to accommodate the disabled.

They're still seriously overlooked for jobs. But that's put the wayside in a country that's facing a rent crisis and a wage crisis and a growing income gap.

Most people take YEARS to get diagnosed with a disease like lupus. They're usually outright dismissed and encouraged to see psychiatrists instead. But that's not an issue compared to the millions that can't afford healthcare or the millions that go bankrupt over medical debt.

Many people with serious painful conditions like this that can't be cured and sometimes can't effectively be managed with PT and other drugs get cut off from opiates because thousands of others abuse them.

&#x200B;

Throughout history and in recent history we've asked the chronically ill to sacrifice themselves for the greater population in all kinds of little ways. Why would this be any different?"
