AskReddit,fr0qrvn,t3_gln8tu,1589804323.0,"I knew something was wrong when I lost ALL taste and smell. Got tested and was positive.

 Never had a fever over 99. Slight nausea and headache the first few days. Severe fatigue. Severe burning sensation in my nose (no congestion). 

I never felt like my lungs had fluid in them, and I could breathe ok just sitting around. But if I was on the phone with my mom I would notice having to take more breaths. My lungs just felt tired.

First day back to my job today and I feel ok. It's been a month since I got tested. Smell and taste came back in week 3. Fatigue improved week 3.

I live alone and no one I was in contact with at work tested positive. That mental stress of thinking I gave it to someone was terrible. 

Unfortunately, it's just a matter of time before everyone gets exposed to it. I just hope that we can find a vaccine or better treatment to fight this thing."

People don't understand how tiring living like this is. Beating myself up is tiring, but having to constantly challenge my thoughts is hard too. How do I know when a thought isn't my distorted reality?

For example, person A doesn't like me. People don't usually come up and say they hate you, but they play games and do small things to know you're not welcome. I tell myself I'm just imagining things, but then I hear from someone else that person A doesn't like me... and then I just completely fall apart because I don't know what to believe anymore."

AnxietyDepression,fpxa55g,t3_gg29ef,1588978631.0,"First off: I'm sorry you are feeling this way. Anxiety and depression suck ass.

Second off: I'm proud of you. You got a license as a vet tech which isn't the easiest job to have. Not only that, but even though you were full of anxiety and stress, you still put yourself out there and got a job. That is amazing!

I'm going through work stress myself, so I'm not the best person to give advice. At the end of the day, it is your life and your decision. 

With either decision, you will be ok. If you give your two weeks, you can find another veterinarian and you can decide if you want to share your info about anxiety/depression. It might help you be successful.

If you want to stay, but can't do four tens in a row, maybe see if they can split up. Or see if you are able to just go part time and do two tens with a day in between. Work your way up to full time. If you want.

You are obviously smart to have gotten a license and you have plenty of options. None are wrong. 

If you want to work at Target, that's ok too. You can always go back to vet tech if you want to. 

There are state agencies in the US that can help you obtain employment and keep employment with a disability. They can work with you in which ever path you choose.

I hope this helped and take care!"

A few days before I found out I had Covid things got worse and I was going to give my two weeks notice. I lost my taste and smell so I got tested and it came back positive. My job was supportive to a point, but after 1 week they started making comments that it was coming close to 2 weeks and when was I going to come back to work. That stressed me out even more. I feel bad for not giving my two weeks when I had originally planned, but like my therapist reminded me, I've got to take care of myself.

I can easily believe when people criticize me and can't believe praise. Because that praise disappears and it becomes disappointment when they get to know me. 

I know this thinking doesn't help me. But this seems to be a constant lesson life throws in my face. 

When I tell my mom how I feel she cries. I don't know if it's because she would blame herself or if she would actually miss me. I dont really know what good I bring to anyone.  Because when I do one good thing, I have 10 bad things I do unintentionally.

I don't regret on taking meds and it has been 3.5 years now. 

I would suggest to make sure you see a therapist weekly for the first month or two you are on medication. That way, if you start having any issues you can change meds. Also have a trusted person check up on you if you are nervous.

P.s tacos are yummy."
SuicideWatch,fnh2l3d,t3_g1prb9,1586953154.0,"The fact that you want people to tell you not to do it shows you really don't want to do it. So don't do it. 

Your upset, as am I, and it fucking sucks. That's all the comforting words I can think of. 

You're not alone in your pain and the pain fucking sucks."
SuicideWatch,fnh1q12,t3_g1ok7c,1586952450.0,"First off, I'm sorry for your losses.
Second, it's not your fault. 
I appreciate your perspective. Not everyone has someone who cares like you did. 
Not everyone is destined to have a happy ending. I don't see any light at the end of my tunnel. No one can give me that. And I keep trying and trying to improve my life and it never gets better. That makes it almost worse. 
At the end of the day, no one is responsible for me but me. Same for your dad. So don't feel responsible for suicidal redditors or your dad. Just continue to be a caring person. :)"

SuicideWatch,fngzp6w,t3_g1ne3i,1586950675.0,The cat part is so true! The thing I worry about is my cat seeing me in the act. I wouldn't want to traumatize him. The one thing in my life that gives me unconditional love .
