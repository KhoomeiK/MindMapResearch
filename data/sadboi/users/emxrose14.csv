Anxiety,f7kfe25,t3_doz3zc,1573807318.0,Exactly how my anxiety is. Some days itâ€™s worse than others but itâ€™s just that; super steady and bad. Yes at some moments it peaks more but I feel like I donâ€™t have an actual attack because I wake up and already feel extreme anxiety.
Anxiety,f7kfbkr,t3_donvsd,1573807211.0,I feel this so much. Sometimes my anxiety is so bad I read the text Iâ€™m going to send over and over again because I think it doesnâ€™t make sense and I am an idiot. Even posting stuff on forums gives me anxiety because I feel like itâ€™s not making sense
Anxiety,f7kf400,t3_dswusn,1573806883.0,Iâ€™m so happy for you!!! Amazing news.
ElectricForest,es8qs6p,t3_c64avb,1561709681.0,Iâ€™ve never went but I have researched so much about it and Iâ€™m definitely going next year! I hope you have a magical time. Update us but remember to just enjoy the moments without technology ðŸ’™ xoxo
