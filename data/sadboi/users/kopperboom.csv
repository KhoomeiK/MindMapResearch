GabrielFernandez,fj7s1zt,t3_fb8kcs,1583097050.0,"I know this is totally off topic but I’m baked and one of your statements got me thinking. 

I have worked in child welfare and have heard of the apathy you mentioned. I’ve only worked in very small county departments so I have found most workers to be empathetic (though admittedly human), just sometimes not well enough resourced or they are overwhelmed with cases. But I wonder if the amount of exposure to child abuse and stress play a role in creating such desensitized apathy in workers *to the point of making these sorts of catastrophic errors*. 

I haven’t watched the rest of the documentary yet nor the social worker trial, but I’m believing that this attitude might be systemic in overwhelmed depts. And I wonder if part of that is from desensitization from the nature of the work itself + lack of resources of course. It’s an interesting concept. I have a difficult time wrapping my mind around so many people failing this kid, even though I know it does happen even in small counties and it’s definitely not unheard of."

bipolar,fixzqgp,t1_fi1newu,1582829636.0,"A few hours typically. I’ll feel suicidal and dreadful then optimistic and elated later. I started to expect it over time and sometimes can predict my moods by a few hours.

But it is hard for me to really tell if there is a cycle because it seems to change, and on top of that pattern, I’ve noticed that I also have actual weeks- to months-long periods of depression. They always come around then I eventually climb back out of them into a few weeks period of stability that is pretty energetic. (Sorry if none of that made sense.) It’s what I consider “feeling like the real me” though. Nothing like being hyper or drastic for 4 days really... but I wonder if I might just experience a form of hypomania that looks like a functional person.

I’ve also been medicated for a few years now so it’s hard to get a baseline and determine what causes what. Hmph. It’s kind of a big mess. That doesn’t even cover it all lol"

I’ve had periods of time where I’ve been suddenly happy and goal-driven and what not for several days before returning to a depressive slump but I’m not sure if that would be considered hypomania. I can’t really think of times since college or so that I slept little and in 4-hour increments at the time (marijuana has been helping me sleep longer since May). I especially don’t think I’ve talked fast for 4 days, but it’s possible I’ve had rapid thoughts for 4 days. I’m mostly depressed and sometimes think I’m getting better again, but then always fall right back into it. It wasn’t until recently when my mood swings had gotten severe that we started really looking into bipolar, so before that is hard for me to remember. I have journals but don’t have the energy to make a timeline of them and try to figure out what was going on haha."

bipolar,fgf0cds,t1_fc0cpq1,1580717687.0,"I saw texts between my mom and aunt (my mom and I don’t care whether we read each other’s texts, we’re best friends) talking during a time when I was especially suicidal. My mom went on about how intelligent I am and what not, and that I’m a hard worker and love my job (nursing assistant) even though I’ve had to miss work, and how I don’t deserve this. She told her she thinks my work hasn’t let me go because I’m a good worker. And my aunt was telling her that I had so much to live for and that she hoped I could find the right meds. I know my aunt sees me even though she appears very positive and uplifting when we interact. She’s an emotional person but she comes across as strong and has her shit together. She’s always liking my mental health posts on Facebook. Makes me want to cry because it’s her way of saying “I understand”. 

It breaks my heart because I haven’t been the person I was since my aunt and her family moved away about 3 years ago. I think it may have worsened my already-plummeting-at-the-time mental health. I hate that they all have to see me like this. I’ve withdrawn several times, my family sometimes triggers me, hardened feelings since they moved. I’m not as happy and bubbly as I used to be around them, always joking and laughing. When I’m with them I’m pretty much trying not to cry or be angry. 

My mom gets my health completely but I don’t want the others to have to see or deal with it. I almost went to the hospital recently and thought about how I wouldn’t want any visitors but my mom. My dad’s even been in mental hospitals 4 times and I still wouldn’t want him to see me there (that’s another story, he’s not so open about his mental health which is probably why he might have undiagnosed and untreated bipolar). It’s just so damn heartbreaking. It’s hard to communicate with family that you’re struggling sometimes when they’ve always known you to be the life of the party. I just want to make them happy but it’s hard when I’m not even happy, ya know. They’re supportive, just wish circumstances were different. They are my reason for living though."

Essentially I was asking how rapid cycling gets diagnosed because it’s kind of confusing.

I actually came onto this sub today to try to find out. I’ll also post and ask for others’ answers.
bipolar,fgenww8,t3_eve18t,1580704374.0,"My nurse practitioners (I’ve had about 4, my latest one specializes in mental health) and I have suspected bipolar for me since about 2015. It was only a month or so ago I actually started to understand it and actually believe I have it, for the same reason as you. Now, I still haven’t been properly diagnosed, but I can tell you I had the same exact thoughts, that my cycles are “too fast”. 

My moods have been in 2-4 hour cycles lately. Currently in a mixed state actually I believe. Just cried from depression about an hour ago. Starting to become hyper again. Anyway, I always used to say/think “I can’t possibly be bipolar, I don’t have stretched out moods, they’re day-to-day or change several times a day.” So I’ve just considered myself to be “bipolar-like” before but never really grasped it. I looked back on my journals the other day and I see I’ve been all over the place for years. I have a hard time keeping jobs and coping with life, especially changes. 

Sorry, I’m kind of starting to have a hard time thinking clearly. 

Anyway, my point, I never thought I could really be bipolar until this past month when I began to understand bipolar 2 and found out that there IS such a thing as rapid cycling (finding that out actually has made me feel so validated. I’ve struggled with this for so long, it stills makes me emotional because I’ve been so close to understanding it but so far away - since 2015.) And there’s such thing as ultra rapid cycling, and ultradian rapid cycling. I told that all to my new counselor the other day, about how I used to always think I couldn’t have bipolar because my cycles were quick, and she was like “nah, there’s no limit to how often cycles can happen in bipolar”. 

I’m determined to get a formal diagnosis or at least rule it out. My heart has had enough. My intuition tells me I’m bipolar 2. Definitely not bipolar 1. 

Sorry, gotta end comment here, I’m completely losing my train of thought. I don’t even remember much of what I’ve written in this comment. Feel like I’m rambling and kind of loopy. Still having an episode of some sort. Just started lithium 2 days ago. Been on trintellix and reintroducing Effexor (which worked well for me for a couple years).

bipolar,ffmrn6q,t3_eu62c5,1580058224.0,"TLDR: I still haven’t been formally diagnosed. A lot of nurses have suspected. One nurse and some research on my own finally convinced me.

About 4 different nurse practitioners have told me over the years they think I probably have bipolar but they weren’t ever sure. They always have made sure to try to address my highs and lows when medicating. The latest one I’ve been to said something about “...for bipolar, because I’m pretty sure this is what we’re dealing with here”, and her practice is specific to mental health so I trusted her judgment a bit more. My old psychiatrist never did much to investigate, I don’t think bipolar ever was brought up or suspected at the time, just anxiety and depression. Since I’ve had my mental health nurse tell me several times she suspects bipolar, I’ve looked into it more. I always thought NO I can’t possibly have bipolar because my mood swings are daily, not a few cycles over a year’s time span... I’ve learned in researching that that doesn’t have to be the case. I’m almost certain I have bipolar II ultradian rapid cycling."

I mean you can flirt and talk and what not, just don’t rush trying to date, especially long distance. There’s plenty of time for that in your 20s and 30s trust me."

AskReddit,fejjf0v,t1_fejicah,1579176784.0,"This is also something OP could’ve realized in hindsight, not necessarily in the process. Parents’ responsibility generally would be to correct their children’s eating habits. If they enabled them by contributing to their habits, I’d say “allowing” would be an acceptable word choice. That’s just my opinion"
