I wish there was a way to discern the difference between players who got disconnected or had something else interrupt them and those who are actually cheating. Maybe I've just had a streak of bad luck but it appears to me to be happening more frequently than can be explained by random disconnections."
woodworking,f6h21l0,t3_dqu2di,1572835217.0,I love these! The one on the left is awesome- love the super bushy eyebrows. These are all fantastic and would be incredible and unique decorations for the right spot.

depression,eyk9jt6,t3_cd0hjp,1567141570.0,"This is me. I'm 34, have a masters degree, a good job, own a house, have a cute puppy goldendoodle, pay my bills, have a pretty solid support system. I have serious chronic health problems (diabetes since I was 11 and related issues). I've had 2 real relationships, (I'm a born-again christian and I try to live out my faith so I'm still a virgin) I was engaged to a girl that turned out to be a mean, vindictive, selfish liar, I've been turned down several times in the last few months. I'm 5'10"", 195lbs and don't have ridiculously high standards. I've lost hope, women ignore me because I'm too old, too boring, too conservative, too introverted, or too disappointing. My depression runs my life when I'm not at work. I have zero expectations and zero chance. Hopefully the disappointment, fear, loneliness, guilt, and shame I feel combined with the three Bs (beer, bacon and butter) will kill me soon."
