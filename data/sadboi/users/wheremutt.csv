britishproblems,fh9mgxq,t1_fh9keln,1581384707.0,"The likelihood of it is just so extremely low. There are <1 billion people in China and the official number of infected globally is about 42,638. There‚Äôs probably more, so assuming there‚Äôs 50,000 infected that‚Äôs about 0.005% of just China itself that‚Äôs infected. Still a lot of unfortunate folk, but in perspective that‚Äôs just so extremely low for it to be affecting your package. Any shipments from the quarantined areas where the majority are infected wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to you. In addition, the time it took to be packaged, shipped, and sent to your location was very likely a long enough time for any viruses to die out. I think people need to have a little more perspective with this virus and look at possibility vs probability. It‚Äôs understandable to be anxious about this, coming from an extremely anxious person. There are lots of countermeasures being taken to prevent this from spreading to the US/UK/etc. We‚Äôre lucky to be in these countries rather than a impoverished third world country where if it reaches you it would ravage the country.  

Just wash new clothes and your hands afterwards; practice good hygiene. You‚Äôll be fine. If you‚Äôre gonna get anything from a package, it‚Äôll be the regular old seasonal flu."

britishproblems,fh9i2gv,t1_fh97joq,1581381823.0,"If nCoV is not contained, mortality would absolutely be way higher than the seasonal flu. That‚Äôs why governments react so intensely, to prevent it from entering the US/UK/other major countries and third world countries (where it would wreck havoc). It definitely has the *potential* to be a deadly pandemic, however because of the measures that are taken to prevent that, the likelihood is so so so much lower. I get bothered when I see comments about someone living in the US quarantining each of their packages for 2 weeks before opening because they‚Äôre scared of contracting the nCoV from it. (A tad ridiculous). 

Possibility vs. Probability. 

You only need to worry if you‚Äôre in China at this point. If cases start going up too much in major countries, then you can start to worry (if you‚Äôre in the UK/US/etc)."
