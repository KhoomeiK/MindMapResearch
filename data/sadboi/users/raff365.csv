cringe,fb4b7wv,t1_fb446h7,1576505520.0,"There are no flat-earth scientists because believing in the flat Earth means rejecting the scientific method when it suits your beliefs.

They say that water can't hold a curve, so they take a high-powered laser six feet above the ground on one end of a mile-long lake before sun-up, and the people on the other side couldn't see the laser until it was raised 18-24 feet above the ground. You'd think this would prove that the water is not flat, but they make up some bullshit about the waves on the lake obscuring the light, or how the water vapor above the lake diffracted the light to make it *look* like the Earth was round.

Scientists make a series of tests and formulate a hypothesis based on the results. Flat-earthers formulate a hypothesis and make a series of tests to try to justify the belief, ignoring or delegitimizing anything they see to the contrary."

They're saying the hairs on the bow should (usually) not be flat against the string, but instead at a 30-45º angle away from the bridge so only half of the hair or so is touching the string.

Of course, there are reasons to use more or less hair, but that comes with experience (and it doesn't hurt to get a private teacher to physically show you what to do)"

Maybe there was a line of text somewhere that you glossed over at the beginning, maybe you accidentally filled out the scantron form one line offset (which would explain why you would miss nearly every question), or maybe you just didn't grasp the subject as much as you thought, but you'll never know without some sort of confirmation.
