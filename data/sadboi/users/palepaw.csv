People don't see how much you're fighting but we do and we're proud of you. You don't fight for them, you fight for yourself. For your health. For your happiness. For a better future. Bcs you deserve it. 
Lots of love and strength from me."

It's just so exhausting talking with people that don't even care about you so why bother.
When you're depressed/suicidal you just don't have the engery. You isolate yourself completely.
I'm ok with them being angry at me. I just don't care."
