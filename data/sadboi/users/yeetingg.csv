depression,fboodw4,t3_edpkii,1577012693.0,"yes, i’m now often pissed off at something little. it irritates me. i punch the wall when i’m out raged because of something i didn’t like, probably because of frustration. i haven’t felt anger before and now it’s consuming me, it’s manipulative. i don’t even know what i’m supposed to do to stop myself. i’m about to lose friends and i’m too scared yet so mad at myself again for feeling like shit."
