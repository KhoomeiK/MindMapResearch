[Possible Spoiler?] I use nook miles to go to the mystery islands. Either I get my native fruit or bamboo and I’ve done this 7+ times. My brother has found almost all of the fruit by doing this method. Is there something else I need to unlock or?  Thanks in advance!!"
depression,f04go6w,t3_d3mqe2,1568387113.0,I completely understand. A person that I trusted said some hurtful things about me (such as Im too passive to be their friend). I told them a lot of personal mental illness stuff and it bothers the heck out of me that they know almost everything... like it makes me feel embarrassed and want to die even more. But life is moving on and I guess we are on some sort of bs ride.

AskReddit,eo8olhd,t3_bqxy89,1558371410.0,"There is a funny story to this one looking back. When I had my final presentation in my astronomy class, my partner and I had the requirement of using physical objects. Since we were doing eclipses, we had a large ball and a smaller one to cast the shadow. I was next to the bag to put them away, so my partner threw the ball at me but did not realize I was not paying attention. Since the screw had already fallen out several times, the lens completely popped out and broke on my face. Because we were timed, I was determined to keep going and finish the damn thing to get the hell out. Little did I know I had blood on my face, in a dark classroom, broken glasses, and the projector casting a shadow on my face. People said I looked right out of a horror movie."
