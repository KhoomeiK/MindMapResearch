Discussion,fmos3d4,t1_fmnf9sn,1586267295.0,"""Your temporary ban is not some sort of retribution.. the rules explicitly make it clear to not use any means of automated posting and this is *exactly* what you were asking about."" You say 'use' but you temp banned me on the assumption I was going to 'use' an autopost bot because I 'asked' about it but not because I 'used' one. That's like a cop issuing a ticket to a driver who drives a ferrari on a 25mph road thinking he would speed or arresting a kid who asked how to use a gun because you think he'd shoot someone. Please tell me you had 100% confidence in on all your bans because you went from 0-100 on your one assumption. I understand the 48 hour rule and that is exactly why I was asking if there was an autoposting bot like it out there. There are posters in the subreddit that post again ON the dot one the 48 hours are up yet you don't think they are automated? There is probably a handful of those accounts in the subreddit and you didn't ban them just because 'they didn't make a post about autoposting'. They're automated! That's WHY you haven't seen them ask those questions! They are already doing it! Quite unfair don't you think? Have you ever eaten an apple? You need to get past the surface to see if it's bad, not just look at the skin. That's exactly what you did here, you just  looked at the skin. Plus, how do we know if you're not running multiple accounts  that make up the top ten list of posters? I don't think mods are all goody toe shoes like they say they are."

FortNiteBR,fijbk3h,t3_f85zbg,1582440935.0,"Controller players are just players on controllers using pc. Very different from console players (60fps,less aim Assist strength) . They have more aim Assist than console so I'm gonna have to say console players are already on a disadvantage. Console if not always, lose to pc players but in a squad you can position yourself to assist the pc player in your team. If it's 1v1 console VS pc, it's a guaranteed loss for console unless the pc player is a bot. Just tell em to support you and figure out the team chemistry in battles. I'm ps4 and tend to help team on players seperated from the pack. It's all strategy in a team play."

FortniteCompetitive,fhxfonj,t3_f4fyjt,1581953282.0,"It's bulky for a paddle attachment. If Sony thinned it out the item, it would be much more comfortable. I've been mistapping the paddles during build fights and I've read that others have been fumbling with it too. 

Also, I discovered that the paddles when spammed are slower than spamming the button bind (I tested with spamming switch mode on button vs switch mode on paddle). You can see a significant speed difference and that could matter depending what bind you have on the paddle. 

Right now, I am considering exchanging it since I have been told that mine is possibly a defect from the input lag but if not then I will ultimately return the item and hope for a better design in the future. My wireless headset also randomly stopped working for ps4 (still works if I connect to laptop, but I get no game audio from ps4) but I am not sure if this is related to it attaching through the audio jack on my controller."

FortniteCompetitive,fh1i58t,t3_exbghr,1581215797.0,"I agree. I don't believe queue time should be too long w/ combined # of ps4+xbox players... I think Epic is just doing this to make it easier for themselves on their end while disregarding the feelings of the community. Sure, maybe there isn't as many switch/mobile players but if they get pushed into matches w/ just console, the disadvantages still wouldn't be as bad as vsing against PC players. I play w/ my PC friends and the fps/load time differences makes it look like they are teleporting in some games. It's so irritating. Epic bans people for SMURFING but isn't this just the same? Pushing players at disadvantages into situations where winning is almost impossible. Also, if you reply ""BuY a Pc iF YoU DoN't LiKe ThIs, GeT GoOd tHeN"", then your balls haven't dropped yet and try buying a PC with your OWN MONEY. If that's what you did, good for you. I don't want to hear it from a squeaky kid  when you haven't paid for a single thing in your life. Some people got bills and rent to pay so why put $2000 into a PC when Epic has the power to undo the FCP? It makes sense to do this for the overall long run since they've already added platform cups. Why should I still being facing PC players in other tournaments? It's like pitting a PRIUS against a FERRARI. Literally giving them free points in the smaller tourneys. Aside from the World Cups which is obvious that you should be on a pc for, why should any console players be at the mercy of a pc player? It ruins gameplay and overall satisfaction of the game for non-PC players."

It's unlikely NA streamers are currently up right now trying to get it so when they do wake up, they'll have to buy it in the item shop. Viewers seeing the transaction makes them want to buy it to so sales happen. Epic games are just a bunch of greedy corporate pigs.
