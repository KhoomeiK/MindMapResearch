We don’t need perfect validity of something we know is written to tell a story, not the literal truth. Heck, we didn’t even know if Troy actually existed until not to long ago when archeological remains matched its description (and I’m guessing it’s still an argument among scholars if it’s truly Troy).

But ignoring that the Iliad is a bad comparison in importance, I think the article’s chart actually says the opposite of the argument presented. 500 years passed before the iliad was written down, and yet 95% of the copies were in agreement. Compare that to the Bible’s much shorter timespan and modest increase in precision and it says a lot for oral tradition. In an extra 400+ years, it lost less than 5% of agreement between copies. Today we hear “not written down” and think “wildly inaccurate”, but back then keeping massive works of literature in your memory in perfect order was a incredibly important skill that was actually done very well."

I asked there what people have done to prepare to become pregnant while on medications, and many people shrieked at me that I was dooming a child to a life of abject misery by giving them my genes. That was their focus, not the dangers of taking powerful medication while pregnant or potentially getting sick again and being ""less"" of a parent. Just the flat out ""they might have bipolar and that's worse than not being born"".

My opinion: 1) Happiness and health are not the same thing, and ""worth"" is not lost with illness. 2) Medical science improves over time, finding new and better treatments. 3) I know how to teach my children mindfulness and emotional intelligence early in life. 4) I'm going to be a powerhouse advocate if they ever do get sick.

To be clear, I do think it's perfectly fine for a person to not have children for *their own* health reasons. We postponed children when I had an inpatient stay and went on disability for a few years. It just really wasn't a smart move to add pregnancy and sleepless nights with an infant to my already unstable mental state.

Strategies really depend on your situation, but I'll give a few a try:

1) If you have any as needed medications (PRN's) for depression, now would be a good time to take one.

2) Resist the urge to sleep. If you know you don't have a cold or another reason to explain the exhaustion, don't take naps and only sleep for your normal amount at night (when the alarm goes off, get out of bed, distract yourself, turn lots of lights on, drink water or eat something, watch a show, just don't sleep). Keep the lights bright all day to try to control your circadian rhythm.

3) Lots and lots of calming breaths. The crying feeling can be suppressed a bit by being aware of the rest of your body. Take time to ground yourself when you start getting overwhelmed.

Now for the kids part

4) Choose activities that you are ""participating in"" without a lot of effort. Ex: Go to the park and watch them play, go to the zoo and give them a goal of what animals to see before going home, go for a walk in the woods and let them explore. These things let your kids have fun and let you be near them without a lot of required talking. My suggestions are highly active both because activity could really help your emotional state and because kids seem to look at a day as more fun when they're exhausted at the end.

You're in for a rough couple of days. But at least you're noticing it and seeking ways to ease your symptoms, and you have a doctor's appointment close at hand. Please remember that it's not a failure to need to step back for a time. You will have more happy days ahead.

They did not, so we do not."
YouShouldKnow,f87xjlb,t1_f87rxm2,1574344598.0,"Every citizen has an American birth certificate or has gone through the process of becoming a citizen. Every citizen has a Social Security Number, and judging by the SSA website that tells you exactly how many  people were born with the name ""Ashley"" in 1988, that's pretty searchable data. Every citizen has to file their taxes with the IRS, which includes knowing where they live and is mandatory every year. Why would we need another way of counting when we already know the number? Especially since the census only shows up every ten years?"

I should add I did have some student loans that I paid off completely, so those don't seem to show up anymore on the credit history list. Do those balance it or are they ignored now?"

There are certainly a lot of behavioral things you can do to watch for episodes too. I know when I'm starting to get just a little too high, my husband can point it out and I'll do some meditation or otherwise slow down. I feel like catching ""subclinical"" symptoms allows me to discourage a snowball into an episode. 

If you have cop issues, it's definitely a good idea to meet with a CIT officer if there's one in your area (at least in the US). Once they know you, they can plan the best way to deescalate and help if they have to be called."

tl;dr Non-standard medications like a nausea medication most people don't need, alternative treatments like acupuncture, needing more than one kind of psychiatric treatment at a time, seeing specialists outside your network, longer than average time in physical therapy, proper levels of PT/OT/Speech therapy for those with developmental disabilities."

Also, it sounds like you stopped on your own, not with your doctor's approval. Not a good idea on any medication, especially Lamictal. If you hate your medication, call your doctor's office and get their opinion on the safest way to get off of it. Make it clear you *will* be getting off it, and they should help you. If you set up ""contingency plans"" during your appointment (if this doesn't work, do X. If that doesn't work, do Y...) your doctor may be willing to change your regiment over the phone, or even authorize their nurse to do so if they're out of the office."

What I would say to anyone who is afraid of a specific side effect is you're not going to get every side effect on the box. You're not going to get half of the side effects on the box. And if you do get the one you're afraid of, there are ways to mitigate it. There are also a dozen ""cousin"" medications to the one you're on that your body may respond differently to. You have options. Keep your doctor updated on your fears and symptoms and let them help you."

personalfinance,f7g8g5z,t1_f7fuc67,1573697228.0,"Welcome to the terror of US health care. My nephew has cancer. Insurance covers chemotherapy...with pre-authorization at every step, so yes, though scream-inducing, he will have all his chemo. The problem is with secondary treatment. Insurance will cover the ""standard"" medications for nausea, constipation, all that side effect stuff. But if you don't respond to those medications, (like him) it's much harder to get other options. The doctors figured out a nausea medication that works for him, but insurance denied it. My sister spent days arguing with them on the phone then finally Facebook shamed them before they'd pay for it. That one medication would have cost over a thousand dollars a month, but she would have paid for it because otherwise he would be in pain all day every day. Anyone who doesn't have the time or strength to bully an insurance company will be paying out of pocket for ""unneeded"" medication.

On a much smaller scale, I injured my back to the point I had to go on FMLA. It was so painful the physical therapist couldn't even start working on it. Pain medication barely helped. In desperation, I tried acupuncture. It worked so fast I couldn't believe it. My pain dropped by half in a day and I was able to start the PT I needed to strength train and prevent future injury. Acupuncture isn't covered in my insurance (it's alternative therapy). I need it, so I pay for it, and it is not cheap. I've doubled how much I've spent on healthcare this year from acupuncture alone. (Granted, we do have ridiculously good insurance, so it doesn't take as much to hit that level, but it's still disconcerting and could get us dipping into emergency funds just a bit to keep everything balanced.)

In both cases, megahertzcoil is right that high medical expenses tend to go hand in hand with loss in income (I was out of work for 3 weeks. My sister took a two year leave from work to take care of her kid.), so when I say ""pay medical bills"" I should have qualified that I include having to replace that lost income in the calculation, so that's another level of headache.

US health care has a terrifying list of flaws, even in ""good"" plans. You need to see a psychologist and be in a DBT class at the same time? Not covered! (Only one visit per week, please.) There isn't a specialist in network for your rare condition? Not covered! It's taking you longer than average to recover from an injury, so you've gone over your allotment of physical therapy sessions? Not covered! Oh, and here's a great one: your child has a developmental disability and needs to be in year-round physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy so that he can avoid serious complications, succeed in school, get a job, and live a life contributing to society? You can have 20 visits a year...combined. Depending on the State, there are a lot of important things expensive insurance plans can deny. It's completely crazy."
personalfinance,f7eypdy,t1_f7ew3ju,1573668671.0,"I am not like your aunt. We don't have credit card debt because we don't treat anything as credit. We only live within our means and anything above costs is swept into investments. If we some day need a loan, some terrifying level of crap has happened to suck up our buffer and emergency fund. But if it did, our line of credit has an interest rate around 3%, and I'd rather use that than pull money out of our investments that are potentially making 6-9%. Then I would slowly pay one with the other.

Mostly I'm thinking of uncovered procedures/medications related to cancer. A family member was diagnosed last year and it's amazing how they had to fight tooth and nail to get things covered. The only nausea medication that worked for them at all wasn't normally covered and would have been thousands of dollars a month if they hadn't Facebook shamed the insurance company."

We only bought a home once the total annual cost was the same as our rent. I guess I assumed most people who buy a house had the same idea/lived in a similar housing market.
