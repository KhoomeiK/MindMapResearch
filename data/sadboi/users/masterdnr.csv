Anxiety,fefyzmi,t3_eonw76,1579070045.0,"My wife does that all the time. She knew I have anxiety, and other issues, and she will just wAlk away and open her laptop to do stuff.

Humans do need effort to understand and learn about each other. And it is not easy being a sensitive person to be understood."
Anxiety,f26f68c,t3_dbszhc,1570007035.0,Yes. It does. Also it made me very tired
Anxiety,f0v8f44,t1_f0v826l,1568969699.0,"I  believe we both caught anxiety as what they called it. I hope both of us will get out of it soon, and if you do, please you let me know how you did it.
Meanwhile, let’s stay positive to the best we can. We gotta believe it’s just the mind. 
Also I am building my relationship with God."
Anxiety,f0v7s9y,t3_d6rs7m,1568968592.0,"The thoughts you having are called ruminations. They ran in your mind, and the more you think they more they come. 
I did many read ups and concluded that they are a form of anxiety. Me too been having such anxiety for months, since Feb 19.

Unfortunately I do not have a way out for you, as I am still in it too. But here is what happen for me, hopefully, it can give you some insights regarding what is happening to you.

Back In Feb 19, I quit smoking and also know of a Friend who passed on. After which I been having this anxiety. 
Mentally, it’s the ruminations, basically I’m imagining being in “Final Destination” Everyday. Physically, I have shallow breathing - difficult to breathe smoothly. And stiff neck and clenching fists.

Currently, I am exercising daily, and on a journey to know God. I’m still in the midst of trying to understand what truly s happening, whether is it chemical or spiritual or both. As chemically, it is a lack of neurotransmitters due to nicotine withdrawal. Spiritually, it could be an awakening to spiritual opening."
