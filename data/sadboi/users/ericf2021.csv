antidepressants,eu8dd7b,t3_cf5tbu,1563554844.0,Yeah your symptoms will get worse for a week or 2! That’s why everybody goes through shit for a while then it starts kicking in slowly and you start to improve better on sleep and stuff! So you’ll always get worse before feeling better like they always say! You’ll be okay trust me! I’ve been through that shit also when I was on sertraline too! My doctor warned me about the first week or 2! That’ll it’ll be worse so just hang on there man! You’ll be okay after a week or 2!
