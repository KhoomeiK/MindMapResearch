depression,fozn9nh,t3_g9ndgw,1588193504.0,"It's like I died at 12 years old 😔 I'm now 23. it's been a battle. I've Never worked for more than 6 months at a time. at 18 I stopped self harming though so that's good. But the ""lazy"" comments from ppl  never go away. I went to school for esthetics and I don't have the energy or confidence to work in the industry. I feel like a failure. Oh and did I mention my depression is medication resistant.. Does it get better...."

Anxietyhelp,fmas7qc,t1_fm8ec3w,1585905737.0,Thank you for responding! I have been to therapy for my anxiety as well. I have all the tools i need to fight this. it just  feels overwhelming more so because of all the extra stress in the world at the moment and all the unknown. I appreciate rhe reminder to face it head on and be to be brave! I needed it
