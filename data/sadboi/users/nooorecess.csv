Anger,fdzpu5s,t3_enbpfa,1578793058.0,"i think a lot of anger can stem from being harsh and critical with ourselves, and that's a habit that's very easy to adopt when our parents are harsh and critical with us. the way your dad talks to you is shitty and unfair, and the worst part is that you turn around and keep doing it to yourself afterward.

one of the most important things i learned was to start undoing the damage my parents did to me (not easy) and ""program"" a new internal voice free of their toxic influence. it feels counter-intuitive when criticism is all you've known, but when you're nice to yourself it actually makes your life so much easier and less stressful. even just things like ""i'm not stupid/bad, i just made a mistake. it could happen to anyone. i will move on and remember for next time."" imagine you're talking to someone else you care about. you wouldn't flip out on them, so why do it to yourself? i promise it gets easier with practice.

the other important thing that comes of working on this is it actually helps you to be more understanding and empathetic toward others. my general anger levels have gone way down because i no longer (ok, rarely) become debilitatingly furious when strangers do things that inconvenience or annoy me. even if they actually are bad or idiots hahah, it's just none of my business. i just give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume they made a 1 time mistake and meant no harm. it just doesn't matter in the end and i sleep a lot better. 

this skill would be absolutely necessary to have if you do end up going into law enforcement because you do not want to be making decisions out anger or bias. you wouldn't want to treat strangers the way your parents treated you, you're better than that and can end this cycle. one day at a time! good luck!"

AskReddit,f8tiuoo,t3_e1we7p,1574804303.0,"i wasn't in love with anyone i dated up until my current partner and had just always assumed that relationships were supposed to be a kind of dull misery that you tolerated and considered successful if you didn't actively hate each other. i thought ""love"" the way we hear about it was probably bullshit and that people who claimed to be happily in love were just codependent/lying to themselves/exaggerating for social media.

i've since learned that i was both right and wrong. i think movie love is bullshit because most movies are unrealistic portrayals of people in general and all we see are flat characters obsessing over each other for no apparent reason, because they have 90 min to tell a story. it's a bad example to take our real life behaviour cues from, and i think causes a lot of confusion and dissatisfaction for a lot of people.

what i have found in my current partner is someone who excites, surprises, and challenges me every day and who i want to talk to about everything because i truly respect and value his opinion. we are also extremely compatible humour-wise and spend the majority of our time laughing, which is really important to me (especially after years in stagnant, joyless relationships.) he didn't save me or fix me, just helped me remember that i have been a fun and caring person all along. we bring out each one another's best versions.

sharing because i now just really want people like my former self to know that love is real, it just doesn't really look like it does on tv. if your relationship is ""fine"" but not happy, you should just know that there are greener pastures even if you've never seen them...

BUT ALSO good love and relationships are not a thing that just fall in your lap because you're entitled to them! i did years and years of therapy, research, self help books, constant introspection etc etc to get to this place! it's everyone's responsibility to work out their own communication issues and previous baggage/bad habits!! keep yourself in checkkk"

Anger,f8c0kmz,t3_e02tlt,1574449632.0,"yeah i get this stuck feeling a lot, where for some reason it feels like i physically couldnt budge my perspective, even though on another level i am aware that it's damaging the relationship the longer i remain stubborn.

my advice is to just push back against every fibre of your being and do what needs to be done to reach out and end the fight. honestly fake it til you make it with this one and just blindly trust that it's the best thing to do, even though it feels fucked/wrong/impossible

the truth is our minds in these moments aren't able to accurately predict how we'll feel after trying a method of conflict resolution we aren't familiar/comfortable with, because we're so zeroed in on the one element that hurt or upset us. we see the other person as a villain and attribute malicious intent to their actions, when it likely just isn't there. as soon as a calm dialog is opened you'll remember she's still the same person and that you're both ultimately ""on the same side"" in this relationship, even if you disagree about certain things

i know it's hard but it does get easier every time you try something that deviates from your go-to anger response behaviours, because you're actually creating new neuropathways in your brain. i wish i had known/taken this info to heart many times over the years as i destroyed countless relationships and friendships by essentially refusing to make myself vulnerable. just remember it never killed anyone! best of luck!"
EatingDisorders,f7wl0j5,t3_dxt2lo,1574034448.0,"yeah this is still something i really struggle with but really i think the best thing is to fight your ED brain on this and resist the urge to restrict as compensation/punishment for a binge, because this will just feed into the cycle and set you up for future bingeing. remember that it's a new day and you still need to eat at regular intervals to get yourself through it. one binge didn't actually ruin anything for you or make a big difference, it realistically didn't alter your body or have any dramatic effect on your health in the long run (even though i know it feels that way.) treat your fixation on the previous food like it's any other anxiety and do things to manage the feelings - keep your hands busy, distract yourself, self care, etc.

it feels counter intuitive to be nice to yourself in a situation where you would normally be punishing yourself, but that's the disorder talking and every time we fight back it get easier to unlearn these damaging behaviours"

just speaking for myself, i have many times been guilty of judging women harshly in this area, and have actually criticized my male friends for what i perceived as being ""easily impressed"" or too forgiving in their assessments of women's personalities. obviously this is bad behaviour and internalized misogyny is wild but my point is that maybe women are so used to working under the parameters of acceptable behaviour/likeability that it would make sense that we're more familiar with how ""the game is played"" than individual men, who might be vaguely aware of the bias but never had a reason to think about it too much. not a fully fleshed out thought i guess but just something that had newly occurred to me and now i will post this comment about it"

EatingDisorders,f52bzpt,t3_dmhkpq,1571949028.0,"i have the same thing and did hear that it's common. i've wondered if maybe it's part of the ""imposter syndrome"" that can accompany self confidence issues - im constantly questioning my own authenticity or my ""right"" to be in certain spaces or getting whatever kinds of attention. these traits/thought patterns are probably partly what make someone vulnerable to ED in the first place, i imagine

and as others have mentioned, i do think it can also be a way of avoiding fully committing to recovery when you're ambivalent about it. i didn't take my problem seriously for many years because in the back of my mind i was assuming ""this isn't a real problem, you could stop any time you wanted."" it was only when my disorder had basically fully ruined my life and i truly wanted to stop that i realized i was actually in very deep and needed serious help

another random thought, not sure about your sex OP but i think that in general women can tend to minimize/dismiss our health concerns even in our own minds because we've historically had a harder time being taken seriously by medical professionals. so there is also that ¯\ _(ツ)_/¯"
EatingDisorders,f4yspfo,t3_dm9lqn,1571884315.0,"congrats on being in recovery!! this sounds really normal to me, i think it's one of the hardest/last things to let go of. i just try to be aware of the food thoughts and if they're distressing to me i try to get to the root of my feelings - like what about going to the restaurant makes me nervous? what do i think will happen if i eat X? and then try and counter it with a rational thought like ""my body needs food like everyone else's"" or ""i need to eat if i want energy to get through the rest of the day"" etc

as for the non-distressing but annoying thoughts, i think it's just helpful to try and fill your day with as much distraction as possible - it's hard at first but it is why the ED therapists are always recommending more hobbies and social activities. i really think over time as you get healthier, your brain just gets bored of thinking about food 24/7 and turns its focus to more interesting and personally fulfilling things. it's probably hard to imagine right now, but i have noticed this gradually starting to happen for myself and i bet it will for you and anyone else too over time!"
EatingDisorders,f4uls2w,t3_dls2lg,1571816786.0,"ah god i'm in the exact same boat. this is one of the toughest parts of the ED for me, especially because i'm prone to becoming irritable and snappy toward people when i'm hungry or feeling food-related anxiety, and i can't help feeling resentful sometimes when my bf or whoever i'm with eats less than me (which either makes me feel guilt for eating more, or cheated of getting enough food because i think i need to stop eating when they do.)

i know this comes from the ED behaviours being so normalized in my own brain that i falsely attribute them to other people's actions - it's hard to believe anyone's ever ""not hungry"" or feeling sick etc; i just automatically assume they are purposely trying to eat less than me as an act of hostility when really they are just doing what's normal for them and have no idea what's going on in my anxious mind lol.

anyway wigglytuffest is right, the meal plan enforcement is what i've been doing and it does take practice but i can tell it's getting better. it also helps that i'm lucky enough to have a supportive partner who is in the loop with my treatment plan so he doesn't question when i pull out snacks at odd hours or whatever. if you feel comfortable discussing this stuff with your boyfriend i highly recommend just getting it all out in the open. i find just talking and joking casually about my weird ""prescribed snacking"" makes it not feel so weird or shameful. so much of eating disorder behaviours thrive in secrecy so i'm finding the more i can just be honest about it, the less power it has over me"

Anger,f239wa5,t3_dbksqg,1569912594.0,"not sure if this helps but i've noticed that usually when i feel an out of control rage it starts with me fixating on some unpleasant but fairly minor event until it's all i can think about and seems like i have no choice but to flip out on others or myself. so i've been trying to ""zoom out"" on the situation as early as possible (before it gets to ""point of no return"" stage) by thinking about things like ""how would i feel about this event looking back on it years from now?"" or ""what would another person think of this if i told them the story later?"" and almost 100% of the time i'm reminded that this isn't that huge a big deal and it's mainly my emotional response that's causing me distress in the moment. rational thinking is obviously easier said than done in the moment, but our thought patterns are just habits we've developed over the years and we can break them with practice. it especially helps to start practicing with very trivial annoyances or before the anger has a chance to escalate into a crisis mode - that way over time you'll be better equipped to deal with more disastrous-seeming situations. if you can interrupt the rage process even for a second, you can get a foot in the door to use a ""delay and distract"" move - just make a deal with yourself that you won't yell/send the message/break the thing for X number of minutes, and if you still feel the same when you come back to it, you can go ahead and act on the urge. this skill prevents me at least from doing external damage even though i may still be experiencing a lot of distress inside.

basically just remember that all situations are temporary and you won't be feeling your current feelings forever. focus on the kind of person you would like to be and be seen as at the end of the day, and know that your anger responses are just a habit you developed to manage stressful feelings - it's not really who you are"
EatingDisorders,f1auka1,t3_d8c6o2,1569307992.0,"sorry to hear; i'm in a similar boat :( i've made good progress in recovery but my hormones have been fucked for months as well - acne and weeping mood swings mostly, like a never-ending PMS state. it's just annoying because a lot of external factors seemingly get tied into and possibly confused with ED/recovery symptoms so it's hard to tell where anything is coming from. i was also diagnosed hypothyroid around the time i started treatment (but my heart rate was already very low due to restricting/over exercise) and was just recently diagnosed PCOS (but i obviously also hadn't been menstruating for other reasons.) all this to say it's very confusing and there seems to be a lot of misinformation online and coming from doctors themselves so anyway i empathize and am also just hoping to ride it out for now... following thread for info as well"
