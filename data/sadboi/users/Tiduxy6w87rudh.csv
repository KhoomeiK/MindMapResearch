Once you are out of your parent's reach find housing. More than likely look for churches or homeless shelters. Or live out of your vehicle if you have one. That is what I did for a few months. If you go to a populated area they will have resources for you.

Go to a thrift shop, and buy some business casual clothes if you don't have any. Next go to the temp agency at 8am (or when they open). Be polite, be courteous, be appreciative, and take notes. 

Find one person that finds people jobs, and only try to deal with that person initially. Show them how good an employee you can be. Fill out all your first day stuff. Then look for jobs you are interested in. Pick some out, then ask ""can I come by tomorrow and follow up?"" They will likely say yes. You show up either when they say to, or when the office is open whichever is discussed. Keep doing this till they tell you wait a few days or something. This will probably happen. Whatever you do always stay in touch.

In short order they will find you a job. After you do, send a ""thank you"" card. If anything then to get you out of their hair. If you are not in love with the job just ask for a new one. Do your best at the one they gave you.

I did this exact strategy during the hight of the 07 recession. I wasn't employed for 7 months. I was told these very specific instructions. I had a job within a week. I had a job I liked within a month or so.

Temp agencies don't do fast food stuff. Being college educated is a huge boon. It opens a lot of job doors that don't have to be specifically in your degree. You have options. 

Depending on how it all shakes out you could be homeless for a while. You could be penniless. However, being someone that has hit near rock bottom once. It isn't the worst thing ever.

Being suicidally depressed and feeling hopeless about it was the worst. I still have to deal with some aspects of it.

That said I am currently doing things in my life that are working towards things I want the malaise of depression recedes. More often then not I now don't feel like a shallow husk of a person.

All relationships between the people you are biologically attracted to pretty much end up forcing you into some variation of that role.

depression,erkmtn1,t3_c2jfd4,1560966880.0,"I use to worry about global climate change. Then I found a few things that are helping.

There was a mass extinction that killed 95% of species. We even lost a phyla. The planet warmed up enough to make a titanic hydrogen sulfate release in the equatorial shallow sea, acidifing the ocean to an unprecedented level. That all happened billions of years ago. At the end of the Cambrian.

We are starting to get insects and bacteria that can eat styrofoams and some hydrocarbon plastics. Unless humanity makes this world an irrated nuclear husk life will endure. Within a few ten thousand years it would be like we were never here.

We are not the first species to wreck the entire planet either. The first photosynthetic bacteria would have decimated obigate aerobic microbiotic life. Which would have been most life on the planet.

However, the oxygen changed the planet allowing for aerobic bacteria. Leading to much more complex life dew a proto kreb's cycle.

All the changes that almost destroyed the entire planet several times are a road map to your father being born. Which lead to you. Losing someone close is the hardest thing to deal with. And I have the least answers for that. Other than with time new nieches are made and we fill them. 

I sincerly hope that humanity makes it over the next few decades. Elon Musk is planning a Mars Mission not tied to any nation state. To phrase a line he said in an interview about ""why are you funneling billions into this kind of stuff?"" He points put. ""Earth is our only option. Even if we survive global climate change what about the next asteroid? The next uncontrolled global plague? Its just a matter of time. We can see that in the fossil record.""

We were born in the most important time in humanity. We are literally watching everything change. The technological revolution we are whitnessing has been compaired to the development of agriculture. A lot of spectacular things could happen in our near future.

At this point it is hard to say what our future holds. I hope this helps."

Have you heard of complex cellular automata? Basically there is an underline reference and a known start condition. 

We see these pattrens arising in nature. From the veins of leaves, how complex interactions like friction work, cloud formation, and even systems of probability.

The interesting part is without having the iteration you are currently on done. You will never know with 100% certianty what is coming next. But if you know all the current conditions you can walk back the math and it looks like a foregone conclusion.

There is also the double slit experiment. I wont try to explain it here. But the results of the experiment laid the foundation of most of our advanced technology.

How do electrons know they are being observed? Until they they are observed they are a set of potentialities. Which also speak to strict determinism not being 100%.
