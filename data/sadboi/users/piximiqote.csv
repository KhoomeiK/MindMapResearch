Things not classed as necessary aren’t usually funded and deodorants fall under that sadly. I don’t mind paying for it but at the same time I’m pretty underfunded myself if you know what I mean. (Trying to make light of it I guess).

I was discharged from hospital 6 days after my surgery with no support at home other than a pair of crutches to help me move around. I live alone so it was horrible. I was so scared of going home and falling and not being able to get up, and I went 2 weeks or so unable to wash my pelvic wounds (2 surgeries in one) and without a shower. My boyfriend had to help me shower when he visited for the weekend.

Thankfully I had a medical professional who visits me at home for something else flag up that I’d been discharged unsafely and she was on the phone to the local doctors for 2 hours trying to get me nurse visits and occupational therapy assistance so I could have a sit down shower and sit comfortably and make food etc.

I wasn’t really told anything about hernias after my surgery. What I’d heard was just stuff I had learnt myself online. When I asked my stoma team about maybe trying yoga after surgery they said I’d need a belt to do that. So I had a company rep visit me at home a few weeks later and they prescribed me a pair of hernia knickers. I wore them for the 30 mins of intro yoga I did at home, and a few days after that I noticed the slight bulge around my stoma. They came back recently to get me a proper belt and it wasn’t great, they were probably stressed or something but I had to hold back tears because they “told me off” for not wearing this one pair of knickers all day every day. Now I’ve worn them all day every day for a week or so and I have a pressure sore from them so that’s great. 

Hernias they again sadly don’t address surgically unless they cause issues with the bags or become too painful. Sorry this turned into a huge reply! Thanks for your reply. :)"

As for problems with the stoma, OP:

It was a huge learning curve at first. Having a lot of resources is a must, I had to find most of these things out for myself online.

The smell, at first, was so bad. I had to wear a mask with essential oils on it when emptying, and I could still smell it, but thankfully that calmed down a LOT as I healed (4 months post op now). I also now buy in-pouch deodorant drops which are expensive but mean I don't have to worry about the smell when emptying (I was using so much aerosol room spray). The 'my poop smells like mint' aspect has given me some confidence when out and about. And also at home because I cannot stand bad smells.

But my biggest problem is the hernia I now have around / behind my stoma. I'm in my 20's and it makes me feel so negatively about my body which I was pretty much at rock bottom with to start."

And I can’t sit on the edge of the tub to use the shower head to clean them. If I tried it’d be a really big risk with how unsteady I am at the moment. I’m making do with dry wipes and cold water.

Stoma is doing well, but he’s shrunk and I never got told about how to deal with that. I need a new template to cut my bags a bit smaller I think. I don’t know how to make one though, and I wasn’t given the paper with different holes in to use as a rough guide?"
ostomy,et89xl1,t1_et3jl7b,1562550620.0,Thanks for the reply :) I’m not in the hospital any more. I’ll keep your advice in mind!
ostomy,et2w83f,t1_esmdd4u,1562423802.0,"I have The Ostomy Book too, halfway through. It’s a good read."
CrohnsDisease,esf44ax,t3_c5sbga,1561916632.0,"Surgery went well, apparently. I don’t remember talking to the surgeons though. I know 2 of them did it. Stoma working okay. My butt is so sore from the other part of operation though and not being able to move.

It’s tough. I’ll update more later on in the week."
CrohnsDisease,esf3jhm,t1_esd2dz0,1561916236.0,Will update main thread
CrohnsDisease,es8bya7,t3_c5sbga,1561693033.0,"Update number 2 (heh):

Half 4 in the morning, time to get up and leave for the hospital in a bit."
CrohnsDisease,es5ton7,t3_c5sbga,1561627859.0,"Update:

It has begun. I took the first dose at 7.45ish, it’s now 10.26 AM. On the third... evacuation when wiping I broke the skin of my butt, so from here on out it’s the bidet then patting with TP. I applied sudocrem but it stung so it’ll be Vaseline from here onwards...

Drinking my last decaf coffee with milk. Breakfast was 30g of Frosties and 80ml of semi skimmed milk.

Wish me luck. I will report back..."
CrohnsDisease,es5tfnl,t1_es4q0t4,1561627486.0,"Good advice, Thank you!"
CrohnsDisease,es4pr2e,t1_es4927y,1561590671.0,Thank you! :) much appreciated!
CrohnsDisease,es4pnwd,t1_es44zym,1561590607.0,"Yep! Ileostomy. I’ve done the prep once before for this op but it was cancelled for medical reasons. So it’s been a long time coming. 

This time around they’ve changed it a bit - it’s still picolax but you can eat normally the day before the prep. The day of the prep is a very low fibre very small breakfast and lunch, and from lunch it’s clear fluids only. So 2 doses of the laxative in total. I also have to take the PreOp drinks which are lemon flavoured clear carbohydrate drinks. And at least a cup of water every hour that the laxative is doing its thing."
CrohnsDisease,es4p6k0,t1_es4165z,1561590252.0,Thanks :)
CrohnsDisease,es4ozj3,t1_es4mzrb,1561590108.0,"Yeah my stoma nurse said to me: “we tell people to completely stay away from 3 foods. Nuts, popcorn, and sweetcorn.”

I then told her that 2 of those are my favourite foods. I’m really going to miss going to the cinema and eating a large salted popcorn to myself while my boyfriend wonders “How can one person consume so much salt?”.

And sweetcorn. I put that stuff in everything. Pasta? Bam. Soup? Bam. Noodles? Bam. My diet is limited in vegetables and fruit anyway but oh well.

I should add that I eat these things and suffer for it pretty soon afterwards."
CrohnsDisease,es4dzp7,t1_es3vvq1,1561582711.0,Haha I really considered getting one from Amazon yesterday! But I thought since I'll only be using it for the one day it would be a bit of a splurge. :P
CrohnsDisease,es3wt4a,t1_es3ta4u,1561572291.0,"Will do, I've got to do something while I'm stuck in the bathroom haha!"
CrohnsDisease,es3vf9z,t1_es3qza7,1561571458.0,Thanks! :)
CrohnsDisease,es3vdnj,t1_es3s3q9,1561571431.0,"Thank you! Dear god, I hope I can eat salad again... That's something I never thought I'd say..."
CrohnsDisease,es3s87m,t3_c5sbga,1561569523.0,"I went all out for this one, since it'll be the last time (for a while?) I have to sit on the toilet for more than a minute (loop ileostomy coming up!).

Also, last time was agony for me: pooping acidic bile when your butt is already bleeding and sore is really, really painful.

The fluffy toilet seat cover is for the day only (hygeine lol), I got it cause my legs go numb while on the toilet, turns out it's because my new toilet is too high off the ground for my short little legs. I can't believe I just realised that, too. So I need to get some boxes or books to prop my feet up. The cover might add some comfort though.

The Vaseline and Sudocrem are for my bum to prevent the dreaded acid burn. Not sure which will work best but I'm willing to try anything after last time.

Sadly both the Picolax and PreOp drinks are lemon flavour. I hope I can stomach lemonade in the future.

And lastly the portable bidet might actually save my life, however I expect the Co-codamol will be taken in vain..."
ostomy,ervj6g9,t1_ertsly3,1561317172.0,"No probs, it was an overwhelming week here too! I met with a stoma nurse and had my pre operative assessment. I still have questions for my surgeon about my recovery times etc but that will have to happen on the morning of I think. All well thanks! How was yours?

Good to hear! On YouTube we have LetsTalkIBD and Hannah Witton who both have ileostomies. Apart from VeganOstomy I'm not sure of any more male YouTubers. There's also a big community on Instagram which is helpful for things like 'hacks' and tips on how other people are dealing with things related to stomas.

Thanks for those! The only question with a difference I asked was about the constipation. The nurse said you can't get constipated with an ileostomy so that's good - I should be fine with painkillers.

I'll DM you the rest! :)"
CrohnsDisease,err3fl9,t3_c3fgkm,1561159169.0,"Yep. Usually I’m moderately wary, but ever since I found out I was having my surgery soon (had it post poned before and I’ve waited around 2 and a half years total now) I have been SO CAREFUL.

Staying inside for days. Holding my breath when someone coughs in my vicinity when I’m outside. Hand sanitiser when I get in from being outside. Washing my hands at every opportunity. Bought anti bacterial soap. Moving away from people coughing or sneezing in waiting rooms. Turning my head if someone breathes near me. I was having lunch outside with a friend after my hospital appointments and a pigeon flew really close and I felt the air from its wings on my face and Jesus I was scared about that too. I told my DnD group to not come over if they were remotely unwell with anything potentially contagious.

I should stress this is a recent thing. I’m on high alert because I don’t think I can take waiting another 10 months for another surgery date if I’m unwell this time.  I’m not usually this stressed about it."
CrohnsDisease,erntxku,t3_c2xf5g,1561060999.0,"This is quite annecdotal, but I hope it can give you some ideas that help:

The first time I was offered an ostomy my immediate reaction was ""no"".

Since then I've had a bit of a paradigm shift. The last time I was admitted to hospital with Crohn's (a few years ago now) was hard. It was around this time that I started to think about it being a possibility.

Long story short, I'm getting a (maybe temporary) loop ileostomy next week.

The thing that helped me change my viewpoint was looking at the idea in a different way. I approached it with curiosity, and I started to learn about the ins and outs etc. I found some great people on YouTube who talked about both the practical side and the more emotional side.

The thing that made the biggest difference for me was getting on social media and finding the other young people in the same position as me, who seemed to be outwardly positive about life with an ostomy. I know social media can be a bit of a 'look how great my life is' thing, but by surrounding my online life with people who spoke openly about the ups and downs I honestly think it really changed my perspective. It made me less afraid, and although I have major body image issues in other ways, I'm feeling pretty optimistic about my operation. YouTube really helped me - although the people are in another country where there are differences in the medical systems etc etc, it feels like having friends who will understand and are willing to show you the ropes.

A bit of a ramble but I hope it helps."
