Pedicures start at $45 but I think there is an express pedicure for $30. I‚Äôm not sure about the manicure prices because I usually do dip nails. Dip nails are $45. There is a slight discount if you pay with cash and teacher and student discounts available on certain days of the week!"

They may give him extra time on tests. Some of the homework was lessened for my daughter too. If a homework assignment called for writing 20 spelling words 5x each, it might be shortened to 10 spelling words written 2x each. Little changes like that can make a big difference!"
