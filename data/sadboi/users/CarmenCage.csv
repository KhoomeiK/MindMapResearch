If this is your first dog I would really do a lot of research about different breeds.

My recommendations would be Australian Shepard’s, border collies, kelpies, or Shetland sheepdogs. My husband and I have a Texas heeler (Australian Shepard + blue heeler) but he is very energetic and needs at least an hour of intense exercise a day.

No one is in the same boat mentally, and it’s a little absurd to think that just because OP overcame their issues, that others are being lazy or not working hard enough. Part of the problem is that people say shit like OP said, and then those who are struggling feel even more hopeless."

There have been mass extinctions throughout earths history, so this seems like it could be a completely natural cycle for our planet. However the CO2 in our atmosphere has surpassed that of any other time in earths history, so it does seem as though we could be having some impact on the global changes. 

From a biblical perspective this is all pointing to the last days as written in the Bible. There is corruption and greed, wars between nations, and people are turning away from religion. There are false prophets who claim they can cure disease while taking millions of dollars from their followers. 

Either perspective points to the end life as we know it."

However the growling from Callie isn’t a good sign. I would recommend doing some research about resource guarding, and also have Eric start feeding her everyday. He should also start doing daily training sessions with her in addition to walking her. I wouldn’t recommend letting her sleep on their bed or be allowed onto furniture if they are doing that."

unpopularopinion,fqhln41,t3_giz0jv,1589379489.0,I feel like part of this issue is that rapists usually don’t get that long of a prison sentence.

That’s not very long for such a heinous disgusting crime imo. I feel like most people just want a longer sentence because rape is such a horrific crime.
