A lot of people on here are aggressive and confrontational for no reason at all, and even when you are correct there will be people trying to make you feel stupid for it.

Don’t be afraid to share your ideas,  when it’s impossible to win you can’t be afraid to lose."
unpopularopinion,fed1pi7,t3_eogc5i,1578994278.0,"you wouldn’t tell a person who sits at a desk all day taking phone calls that they don’t have a real job.  Would you also tell an elderly or disabled caretaker that what they do isn’t a real job? Just because I don’t have to leave my house everyday doesn’t mean i’m not constantly working from sun up to sun down. A job is something that teaches you valuable transferrable skills.  

I have to be the cook, the cleaner, the landscaper, the caretaker, the designated receptionist for all appointments and calendar events, I also have to do all the shopping and plan meals accordingly following a budget (that I also had to create to maintain household finances)  
I also don’t get sick days and I take my responsibilities with me on vacation.  

Also,  TV time is actually very minimal.

You also sound very bitter"
Anxiety,fea64ae,t1_fe9v725,1578944801.0,"The outside actually does help relieve stress and anxieties in a lot of people.  She didn’t say cure.  Read again, and maybe don’t be an ass next time."
depression,fea533a,t1_fe9ebw5,1578944459.0,"Depression does suck, but most people that have depression can still hold a job and live a relatively normal life.  I don’t think depression is the issue here for these people. I don’t really understand the love of socialism either because people who live under socialism also have to work a 9-5 and what not to keep the civilization working.  There is no system that doesn’t require a substantial amount of work.  It’s baffling."
depression,fe96u94,t1_fe9124j,1578934911.0,So go be a hermit somewhere.  Literally no one is forcing you to be apart of modern society.  Go hitchhike and live off the land in alaska or something.  Go watch life below zero for inspiration.
depression,fe8wb17,t1_fe8v304,1578931767.0,"Don’t need a smart phone and they have cheap flip phones for very little a month. As for health insurance.  When you make very little you get it for free.  Also,  eating ramen potatoes and rice are still good enough to survive, if you want more, you have to work more.  There is literally no way around this no matter where you are in the world."
depression,fe7chdq,t1_fe795kd,1578912786.0,Sorry?
depression,fe7cfgp,t1_fe78bfm,1578912763.0,"So cut out luxuries and live on a min wage part time job.  

Thats like 20-30 hours a week and you’ll have more time for whatever activity’s you desire.

We don’t need a lot to survive, we work long hours mostly to afford thing things we want, not the things we need."
depression,fe6qv6t,t1_fe6qkud,1578901122.0,Well according to most people I see on here they think that because they didn’t ask to be born that  they shouldn’t have to do anything.
depression,fe6qcsn,t3_env9a0,1578900467.0,"You only work about 1/3 of your life, which means you have the other 1/3 for sleeping and 1/3 for whatever the hell you want.  It’s a balance.  

It sucks, but it is what keeps the chains of modern society rolling."
depression,fe6pxxy,t1_fe6eyai,1578899947.0,As someone who owns a business I urge anyone who can’t fathom a 40 hour workweek not to bother.
depression,fe6pq9t,t1_fe6p6ji,1578899674.0,"“Ideally” lol

Every system is going to work you into the ground, things have to be made, things have to be done.  Modern society takes a lot of effort to maintain.  

Also idk how capitalism has anything to do with meaningful relationships."
