Like, if I cut to gain some kind of control, then my cut being so shallow just says that I didn't gain enough control. If I cut to punish myself, then my cut being shallow says that I didn't punish myself enough.

A teacher saw my cuts and said ""that's not cute.""

I kind of got in trouble when my mom found out. And some family members told me I shouldn't do that to my mom because she busted her butt taking care of me (I was 15 at this time). My aunt was the one who asked if I wanted help, and when I said yes she took me to the hospital.

I'm an adult now and no one knows I still do it. I have a friend who is always trying to one - up me (especially in matters of mental health), and I'm pretty sure if she found out, she would do it too."

schizoaffective,fo53gu0,t3_g4xun3,1587516691.0,"Last year. I got off because they were making me excessively drowsy and I couldn't take it anymore, and I didn't think I needed them.

But then I couldn't sleep more than 2 or 3 hours, my head was so loud I couldn't shut it up.
Then I got physically ill because apparently I stopped eating without realizing it, I'm not even sure for how long. My room was an absolute mess and I'm a very neat person ordinarily.
Then I started hearing my ex's voice inside my head telling me he was dead. I was too scared to call him in case it might be true.  I was so miserable but hated my meds so I called my psychiatrist and she had me come in right away and put me on something else. 

This whole thing started in April and ended in August. It didn't help that I had some outside stuff going on with my family. I still feel a little sick thinking about all of it.

ETA that was not the first time I got off my meds and realized it was a mistake. It is just the most recent and with the most severe consequences."

Maybe make sandwiches and eat them off napkins or paper plates so you can just toss them in the garbage when you're done. At most you'll have to clean only a butter knife. Frozen dinners will save you from dishes as well because you just pop them in the microwave and eat from the packaging. You can eat applesauce right out of the jar, or yogurt out of the container. Trail mix is pretty filling too and all you need are your hands. You could also eat cereal dry out of the box.
