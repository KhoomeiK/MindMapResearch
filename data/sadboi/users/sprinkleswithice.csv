Maybe try to find out why your friends are avoiding you and try to tell them that you are going through a taff time. You don't have to tell them everything, but let them now that how you behave at the moment is not a normal thing and you also wish that is was different. And you can do this in steps.

Be honest to your parents and how you feel. I know that this is a really hard part, but they can only help you if they know how you are feeling. Maybe tell it first only to your mother if you don't feel convident telling it to your father. 

Try to find hope in seeing your son again. He is probably missing you as well. See seeing your son as a goal for now to work to something. This wil give you a rythym in life again where you can build from."

depression,fbqsbxw,t3_ecr5h6,1577035082.0,"From what I am understanding lays the roat of the problem with not feeling accepted by you mothet. Since talking to you mother doesn't help, maybe sending her a letter works (if you haven't done it already). Do you have a uncle/aunt/cousin or niece you can talk and understands you? Ask him/her to talk to your mother. 

Getting friends is hard sometimes, but by keep doing what you love to do will bring you closer to other people. Don't forse yourself to make any friends and Just let it kinda happen. I also feel tired 24/7 and that makes it harder to make any friends. You are just to tired to make contact with somebody. But by doing sports classes or hobby classes (for you visual art maybe) you will see people with the same interests you can talk with. Also these classes give you something to look forward to in the week. 

Analysing everything is just a way you think, I have it as well. Sometimes people get annoyed by it because I don't accept things immediatly, but ask questions first. Thais also leads to meaningless discussions about stupid subjects, but previous week I heard from an old classmate that she is missing these discussions sometimes and when she tells them to her new friends and als them what they think of it, they give her a weird face. Even this gave me a feeling of appreciation. Conclusion, don't think to much about this if you do.

Talking a psychologist doesn't help for everyone. The one I am talking to currently isn't helping for me either, but that doesn't say none of them work. You just need to find the one that understands/works for you.

Try also to accept you mother for who she is even if she really is a racist. For her you are the odd one as well. Acception come from two sides! Saying that she stille prays for you probably means that she wants it to be good between you two.

 I feel exactly the same about people here on my uni (almost free). They are just not the kind of people for me.
