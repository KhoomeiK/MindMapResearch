I felt alright a couple of days ago like I was getting better but then the shortness of breath got a tiny bit worse, I'm breathing fine but just can't take deep breaths, if I just go downstairs my heart starts racing, the same for just walking, it feels like I'm getting better, I was definitely worse before."

2. On day 37
3. Difficulty breathing has been my top symptom, I never had a fever, I had migraines and headaches but now they're rare, never had crazy coughs, just the odd few coughs every now and then, but at 2 separate occasions upon waking up during the night I did have a dry coughing fit, I lost my sense of smell for a couple of days 50% of that has come back I can still feel my nose semi blocked, some days when I try to sleep, for a couple of secs it feels like I don't breathe and that wakes me up? Or some days it feels like pockets of air comes up too? Shortness of breath and pain in my stomach, also a bloated stomach but I think that's unrelated. 
4. Skinny, rarely went gym but never had any past health issues, I did have asthma when I was a kid but outgrew that in my early teen years.

I did go hospital to get checked out a month ago, no tests available because my symptoms are mild, I got a chest xray and blood taken, they said it was a chest infection, they gave me antibiotics for the week, that ended around 4 weeks ago, those pretty much didn't do anything."

They didn't check beforehand because I didn't have a cough, no fever, no sore throat, haven't been abroad, all I had was a racing heartbeat and a shortness of breath, they gave me antibiotics (co-amoxiclav) for 7 days and if it doesn't get better then I have to go back"
