Go ahead and tell me what firearms you think are perfectly fine to have and don't just say any used for those above but actually give me examples.

The front and back are the largest compartments and if you have to drop a half loaded trailer for whatever reason, its much harder to do so with the front full even though thats the ideal way to transport a half loaded tank since the weight would be on the truck itself instead of at the ass end. When I worked in the oilfield, our transports would unload from the back first depending on how much we actually needed to offload. Preferably we would take all 7k they carried but it didn't always work out that way and if a location was down for a while, they may only offload 2500-3k gallons which is usually one of the larger compartments."

You also have to look at the numbers of people that don't have a bunch of games installed on their systems at once. Majority of people probably don't so when it comes to using a 2tb drive vs 1tb, especially one that can support the bandwidth needed, Sony is well aware that knocking $100 off the asking price when most people won't care too much about having that 1tb extra space but would instead prefer to spend less, they're going to target that market, especially if it costs them less to manufacture. Most gamers aren't hardcore and want the best etc but are happy with what is released."
PS4,fqoyntq,t1_fqov3ic,1589528949.0,"Do you actually have any understanding of how the storage interfaces actually work or are you just looking at capacity? You realize Sata and NVME aren't brands right? You realize the bandwidth will allow more than faster load times in a game? NVME drives are already fast as fuck for data transfer on a large scale and it also helps manage compressing and then decompressing large files. Assets load quickly since they aren't spread out across a drive and have to be searched for by an HDD and then bottlenecked by the limited bandwidth of SATA, games can remain compressed when not in use, saving space and then decompressed on the fly when accessed. It's easy to look at load times as a few seconds but everything out there in games atm is made to utilize SATA and it's bandwidth cap as well as an HDD. When current gen was developed, SATA 2 was being replaced by SATA 3 and SSDs were small, pricey and problematic. Now that's changed with capacities growing every year, problems with trim being fixed and prices dropping. Look into the difference an NVME drive can make in large file transfers etc. It used to not matter unless you were doing backups or video editing but now with people having large files regularly on their computers, it's needed now more than ever. Sure it would be great to have a large amount of storage but if the storage medium can't keep up with the demands of the system then it's pointless. You're wanting bigger because you think it's better but that isn't the case here. There's a very good reason Optane became a thing even if it hasn't caught on very much. You don't want your RAM waiting on data from a slow storage. It's not about faster load times when starting the system or a launching game. It's about playing the game and then hitting a loading screen because the system can only handle a little bit of data at a time because it can't keep up. Larger and faster RAM requires a larger and faster storage interface to feed it."
PS4,fqoun10,t1_fqoqzyg,1589525365.0,"You realize 1tb of NVME storage is much more convenient to have vs an SSD that uses SATA 3 right? Transfer rates are much higher so moving files is quicker.

PS4,fqoui55,t1_fqotde2,1589525250.0,Already confirmed it is. The main drive will be expandable on the ps5 and the Xbox will take proprietary expansion cards that slot into the back since the main one is either soldered to the board or more likely would require a full teardown to access.

PS4,fqnmv2r,t1_fqnlxzi,1589497711.0,"I mean it's enough for a console to launch with. Besides, SSDs don't have the problems they used to so degradation isnt as big of an issue as it once was. That paired with compression, faster read/writes as well as faster downloads means it's not as big of an issue to delete games. Also I believe we'll be able to keep games on an external drive that we don't play as often but I could be remembering wrong. Either way I'm not too concerned about it.

A firearm is just a tool and it like anything else can be used against someone. It's easy to fear them when you're uneducated about them and see them used for crime.

I'm not saying that we should off them after a certain age but when such a large percentage of our government and voter population is too stubborn and ignorant to change that needs to happen, you run into issues. How things were 40 years ago is not how things are today and allowing those people to still be in charge leads to issues for everyone else that has come after them. We have age limits on voting etc but we don't ever stop them from doing it once they're old enough to start.

In this case an airsoft gun modelled after an AR-15 or even a .22 with pinned mags and a bolt action would still look the same to someone that doesn't know any better.

The amount of time and money a Canadian spends to own an AR-15 or similar firearm legally is well beyond what anyone wanting one for malicious intentions would do. Their recent shooting was with handguns illegally obtained as the guy went around impersonating a cop for 12 hours. Guns are not the problem here but instead a lack of proper response by authorities cost many people their lives. If guns were more common in Canada, there would be a higher chance it would have ended quicker with less casualties. No law in place at the time stopped it from happening. Trudeau has effectively fucked over law abiding citizens of his own country even if they comply during the two years and surrender their firearms since they will not be properly compensated for their time and money involved in the proper licensing and purchase of the now illegal guns."

oilandgasworkers,fplkbm9,t1_fpljjax,1588714253.0,"Probably just down hole issues. We had a well in NM that was a straight bitch to frac. Other 2 wells on the pad were about 2.5 hours to frac per stage but that one got to  being long because it would fight us on pressure a lot. Longest stage on it was damn near 6 hours but it averaged 4-5 hours. Not sure what the deal was with it overall since it started fine but about 10 stages in, it fought us. Ended up using a lot more FR on it than expected. Sometimes its just how it plays out and its probably just one that you have to really watch so you're not having your popoffs go all the time."
oilandgasworkers,fplj3uc,t3_gcyx9f,1588713626.0,Pretty common to run 8-10k vertical and then another 8-10k horizontal out here if not more.
oilandgasworkers,fplio0k,t3_gdfeph,1588713400.0,"Check your water, double check your sand isn't fucked up or you're running the wrong type. Had that happen on a few different jobs I've been on. Double check you're running the right FR though you'd definitely notice that instead of random spikes. Make sure your equipment isn't acting up. Is it always on the same well or does it follow after swapping wells?"
KindVoice,fphg17i,t1_fph1j26,1588620635.0,I'm 28 and still doing it. Time heals a lot but it takes forever to do so
KindVoice,fpfuewj,t3_gd5o64,1588583889.0,Just because someone doesn't care about you doesn't mean that you don't care about them and unfortunately it hurts so bad and there isn't much you can do until over time you care less. I've found it's always there in some way over time no matter what though.
depression,fpfrdqc,t3_gcqgu7,1588580739.0,"God damn it would be great to have someone to hug me and help me through things. Never have and never will unfortunately. Would be nice if the texts I got weren't ""hey, what's up?"" and instead ""Hey, you doing alright?"" or something. Like I don't want to vent and stuff all the time but damn would it be nice to have someone in my life that wants to make sure I'm alright instead of just casually checking up with me about nothing. I've never had anyone to talk about a bad say at work with or talk about things bothering me. With this virus shit, I'm off work from the oilfields for a while so it's a major change to my lifestyle and I haven't had luck getting on anywhere else. I don't want to find a friend on the internet to talk to about stuff but at the same time I do because I don't know what else to do."
battlefield_4,fpdytox,t1_fpcuwjl,1588536963.0,Ground War definitely tries to capture the large scale battles of Conquest in BF with a mix of the normal MP from CoD. Its a hot mess
battlefield_4,fpdymbc,t1_fpctx88,1588536844.0,You also have Plunder in Warzone. But hell even Ground War on Modern Warfare has nothing on Conquest in BF4 even though it tries so hard.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fpdu22q,t1_fpbxaam,1588534232.0,Been different ways to do it over the years from what you described to things like Rabb.it(RIP). Kosmi.io is pretty decent though I haven't used it much. I know there are other things you can use as well.
