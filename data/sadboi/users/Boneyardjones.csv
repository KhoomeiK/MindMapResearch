PhonesAreBad,fii3u8c,t1_fihkwlc,1582417011.0,"The first couple films are pretty good, but the 3rd is like a weird western spin off and doesn’t really compare. The 2nd film involves Marty traveling to the future (2015) and there’s literally hover cars and hoverboards everywhere. So that prediction was pretty far off. However, they do have the bully character from the 1st film become ultra-rich and powerful in the 2nd film, and he actually makes a great portrayal/parody of Donald Trump. So they at least were able to predict that."

And oxygen deprivation can be negated by breathing oxygen alongside the nitrous and not holding your breath. I just.... I really hope you’re kidding here.

TimeTravelersNet,fd8ofym,t1_fd8lsym,1578220920.0,"What’s rare is realigning your time discrepancy! When you develop a time swap it can cause a millisecond delay on your time line, every TFR(timeframe rate) is slightly behind the next. You’ll eventually notice some synchronization issues. Nothing major or noticeable for a long while, so don’t worry. You have enough time to complete your visit without more than a 1 second delay by the end. 


The best know cure for sensory desync is karaoke and alcohol. Alcohol increases your brain’s neurosuggestablity which can trigger a sensory reboot if properly drunk. If you manage to follow along with words on a screen, keeping tempo, and vocalizing melodies, it will bring your sensory group forward into a cohesive pattern.


Anyway, hope that helps and best of luck!"
