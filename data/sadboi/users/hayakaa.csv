Rabbits,fox2es2,t3_ga2aer,1588132461.0,"I’ve checked so hard for any sign of earmites or anything else the internet indicates. She’s happy, doesn’t itch, eating and drinking fine. Just dry bumps on her outside of her ears. Any thoughts???"

Rabbits,fny3y7b,t3_g4l9ie,1587352821.0,"Story: My bf and I adopted this sweet bunny named Peach about 3 months ago, and she had a surprise litter of 5 babies in March!  Long story short, ever since we got her, she has had a floppy ear. I worried it coulda been ear mites or something so I kept an eye on it and everything was good, no crusting, no scabs, not excessively itching. We got used to her floppy ear and stopped worrying about it or even noticing it. 

Summary: Now fast forward to now. All 5 of her babies are healthy and crazy. But several of them have the same, one flopped ear. No pattern in which ear is flopped. I have checked them all 100000times and their ears are clean. I see them itch once n a while but nothing excessive. 

Question: is it normal to have one ear floppy in some bunnies, cus I’m PARANOID that there’s something wrong. But like I said, I’ve checked and checked and done all my research. Just nervous as a first time bunny mommy. TIA!!❤️"

mentalillness,fnworrj,t3_g4d2s6,1587322474.0,Weed is not comparable to any other drug. Drinking alcohol statistically causes way worse psychotic episodes etc for most people. it’s just getting used to the different effect it has. Start small and work up. PS I speak from experience
