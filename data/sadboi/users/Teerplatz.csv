While most large countries' \*populations\* are right liberal to conservative leaning, that doesn't dictate what the status quo is. The current socioeconomic system at work in the world is neoliberal capitalism. Most people aren't politically educated, which means they adopt the values of the current hegemonic ideology that is passed through our education system. The hegemonic ideology right now is neoliberal capitalism. The values of said ideology, i'd agree tho, are conservative (Thatcher, Reagan). It gets really messy because we've just been conflating value positions with socioeconomic positions and it can get a bit weird.

Also, if you ever observed any non centrist political environment, you might have noticed that everyone calls their detractors ""libs"" pejoratively, both the right and the left. That's because for a right winger, anyone to their left is a liberal, stopping at communists, and for left wingers, everyone to their right is also a liberal, stopping at conservatives.

Of course, i'm thinking on a unidimensional scale here, which you might consider incomplete. If you're thinking in a bidimensional libertarian-authoritarian/left-right scale, then liberalism still sits in the center, but also encompasses a lot of the libertarian right, although the more extreme parts of the libertarian right usually defend a much different version of capitalism than current neoliberalism.

neurodiversity,foqdhpj,t1_foq30s8,1587990875.0,"The term ""militant"" literally means ""avid activist"". I've seen multiple ppl use this word in multiple contexts and in multiple languages. Never seen anyone refer to terrorists that way. The most extreme view i've ever seen being refered to as ""militant"" is anti-dictatorship groups that fought for freedom here in Brazil during the military regime in the 60s and 70s, and those weren't terrorists, they were just leftist. Most of their work was keeping each other safe and organizing protests. It's a word very commonly used to ascribe avid leftist organizers.

You are SEVERELY overreacting to this, mod."

AskReddit,fop7386,t1_fop0701,1587954543.0,"I appreciate the kind words, but you seem to have a misconception. The vast majority of people who have been abused at childhood *do not* grow up to become abusers. That's a common misconception that exists because the vast majority of abusers were, in fact, abused during childhood, so ppl end up matching one thing with the other. The reality is that people who have suffered with abuse in the past tend to fall into abusive situations again and again. That has certainly been the case for me.

Again tho, i appreciate the sentiment. Hope i don't come off as a pedantic asshole."

From there it develops into a more and more emotionally weighted narrative (be mindful that this entire thing is almost entirely emotionally based, since there are little to no facts and empirical evidence that corroborates with their opinions, besides very clear misinterpratations of sociological theories of gender), and the hate develops form that. At that point they're so invested it doesn't matter how much effort they put into just hating these ppl, because it's all that matters to them, because they're convinced that all of this is freakish, that all of us are disgusting rapists, etc. It's very visceral hatred."

This also goes personally to you, OP. For your own sake, don't interact with content you don't want to see. You watching, rating and commenting on these videos makes the algorhythm ""think"" that you like seeing them in your front page. It'll flood you with that garbage for as long as you keep interacting with it.

The best you can do to avoid this kind of thing and push for the rights of queer ppl is by teaching your kids right, supporting ppl that do advocacy, studying about the subject (read on some gender theory, actually reputable and peer reviewed studies of gender), developing good arguments and rhetorical skill, and doing real life advocacy (debate ppl irl about it, go to local organizations pro lgbt+ rights and organize, even start your own yt channel with good information about the subject, or just debunking common conservative talking points, or sharing any kind of info that might be useful to ppl with your objectives)."

I feel like the best way to show him that you're there for him is... Well, being there for him. He is gonna need friends eventually, and when he need a friend, be there.

You call him a friend, but at a moment you say you're ""not a friend, so fair-weather that I'd just drop him like a hot potato"". Are you guys close? I ask because you could just state to him that you love him and will support him no matter what and so on and so on (\*sniff\*), but that becomes a very weird thing to do if you guys aren't too close.

Also be sure you're not treating him in a weird way as well. I know we can get sort of infatuated when our friends are, like, """"""different"""""", and become overly self conscious around them and start acting weird. Try your best not to do that. That'll pbbly make him uncomfortable and overly conscious of his status as a trans person when he's around you.

Also, like, the basics. Don't misgender him, treat him like you'd treat any dude, ask him if he's comfortable sharing personal stuff about the transition if you intend on asking."
