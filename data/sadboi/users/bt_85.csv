Even if there are still many saying it's fine, you can't just choose ignore that.  

But for ignoring the anecdotes anyways - my lab dealt with a consumer product that had a pressure vessel in it.  We got 5 field reports they exploded, out of 1 million.

And it IS a seizure every treatment, plus all the cognitive stuff.  To me, there is now zero reason to give people ECT.  Go up to a patient and say ""well,  we're going  to give you weeks of ECT which we admit gives almost everyone short term memory loss for during treatment, has general anesthesia for every treatment, and has documentation of permanent cognitive damage.

&#x200B;

As for anecdotes do not equal data.... well, that's why there are studies and meta studies in there from peer reviewed journals.  As in, data.  Not anecdotes. 

And I included views from therapists because they are highly trained and experienced, impartial, third party, mental health professionals.  And they generally know patients better than psychiatrists -  it's just objectively so given the health care model.  Therapists see patients an hour at a time every week or every few weeks.  Psychiatrists see patients for 15-30 minutes every 1-6 months, and have to spend a good chunk of that time on critical medical items.  So when they say I have patient who comes in, then went to do ECT, and now has tons of cognitive issues, that's more qualified than an anecdote.  

And as for the general cop out of ""anecdotes don't equal data"" that people like to hide behind in the medical field..  that is true, to a point.  At some point anecdotes become ""field data"" that is incredibly useful and helpful, since it comes from the actual real world scenario, with many, many, many more trials in nearly an infinite number of variable more than what is done in the artificially controlled lab.   In my medical product design work, we have to pay attention to and use field data.  Our devices would fail without it, and we would eventually get sued for negligence when things go south.  Imagine if other areas brushed off field data.. customer service and tech support would be useless.  Software would almost never get patches and updates.  Products and services would never evolve and improve, no one would ever rely on experts since all their experience is just anecdotes to someone else... etc, etc.  Point is, anecdotes become field data, and everyone uses that even if you don't realize you are. 

And the ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" - I have read that hypothesis of t hat gravely influence the public's opinion of ECT a lot in my research.  And man, is it weak.  A book written 58 years ago and a movie released in 1975? A single dramatization nearly half a century ago making an entire population have an certain opinion of ECT all these years later overriding all other positive uses in pop culture, public general experience, and scientific findings (unless, or course, those last two don't support that...)?  Common.  Be real.  And if you wish to use the plural of anecdotes is not data, where is the data that this is strongly affecting opinion today? I always hear this parroted around, but never any backing or justification.  

&#x200B;

And as for brushing off dysfunction as subjective and not objective.. some can't be denied - forgetting you're own kids' childhood, having to go to nursing school again, forgetting where you live, and on.  Others, well, yes cognitive function and memory are incredibly hard to quantify and measure.  So, how can you be so sure your measures are capturing the entire scope and depths?    Even with those tests available, it's iffy.  My psychiatrist and a neurologist scoffed at my claims of decreased cognitive capacity due to lithium for a year.  Eventually they relinquished and gave me some objective measures.  They were bad.  I stopped lithium.  They immediately went up.   So if they never gave me the test, would my memory problems just been my imagination? And what if the tests never existed, as is the case with so many parts of memory and cognition?  Would I have forever been having bad memory as part of something else or part of my subjective imagination?  Now that is definitely an anecdote, but one that serves only to demonstrate a concept and idea about how something and complicated and poorly understood as memory and cognition can't have a very few tests held up as the gold standard be-all-end-all and damned be the rest of the information coming in.  By contrast, when engineers get in that type of situation, we immediately ask ""What are my lab tests and measures missing or not taking into account?""  and not ""Well, that was real world, and not a controlled setting, and could be shaded even just slightly by opinion so we'll ignore it."""

[This one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16301882/) says while people were satisfied \~9 months later, but had significant cognitive problems.

And on, and on, and on.

I see you're a psychiatrist, I really don't get how so many psychiatrists don't realize or admit that this is a side effect.  I mean, it sooooo widely reported by patients that I can't understand that at a minimum it's known it happens, and the discussion is just over how often and how bad.

 Unfortunately I couldn't relocate the analysis for you here, but it noted how there is a major disconnect between ECT perception when it is a provider-based study/view or a patient group based one.  Effectiveness, satisfaction, memory, everything.  Even to the point where they will look at the same data and reach different conclusions.  An example that was given, a survey was done of ECT patients and non-ECT patients on what they think of certain statements.  Of the results, providers said ""More non-ECT patients said they strongly think ECT causes permanent cognitive problems than ECT.  It is clearly just an education issue.""  But the patient-group analysis said "" Woah, hang on - half of the people who got ECT said it causes permanent cognitive problems.""

\- Don't lie or misdirect if they ask you questions.  Besides honesty, it could cause them to change their decisions for care in a way that is not as good for you as if they did it will your actual situation in consideration.  

\- Tell them what dose you are at when you are at the visit

\- Immediately after telling them the dose say ""But I want to taper off to zero because..."" 

\- Go from there based on what they say, their follow-up questions to understand you (or if they don't and just push you a direction without taking the effort to understand you) and how much your trust them."

Now, compare that to consumer group style studies of ECT patients that find only 40% thought it was worth it or would recommend it to a family member.  Be careful that you're not only getting one point of view.  

As for how much it's overhyped compared to A/D's, well, you need to be your own judge for that.  But keep in mind pretty much all side effects for A/D's are reversible on discontinuation.

Others have mentioned ECT.  Be careful - ECT is dangerous.  If you are considering it, please do your own research using qualified sources that is independent from what doctors tell you.  I've looked into it a lot, and found health care provider groups view of ECT is much different than patient groups' opinion (and quite frankly, the group that matters the most).  They will even look at the same data and come to different conclusions.  The example I saw  that hammered it home:  A study was done asking ECT  patients and non-ECT patients questions.  One was ""Do you think ECT causes permanent long term memory problems?""  More non-ECT said 'yes' than ECT people.  Provider groups concluded ECT and memory loss is therefore an education issue, and we just need to properly educate patients about it.  The patient-oriented group looked at it and said ""Hold up, half of the people who get ECT are saying it causes long term memory problems."""

As for why psychiatrists in general, I see a few reasons.  Psychiatrists usually have lower wages, yet the same med school costs and time, and the work is harder to boot (more difficult patients, you can't just look at a x-ray, blood test, or MRI to know what is happening, and less of a support network of specialists to back you up and share the load of a single patient).

In my opinion and observations, that  is wildly irresponsible and not fully taking you as a person into account.  It modifies your life in a major way.  From various subs here and in other conversations an forums Seroquel works all around well for a very few people, but most it just makes them tired, sedated, sleep long, never fully wake up, or zombifies them.  It's considered a major tranquilizer.

&#x200B;

It is FDA approved fro Bipolar treatment, but that doesn't mean it doesn't trash your life in the process.  And that was a long time ago with few options, we've come a long way since then.  Do  the math on how many effective vacation days from work you lose a year if it makes you sleep an extra hour or two every night.  And think about how your life will be if you accept this sentence of never actually being fully awake during the day ever again (remember, lifelong medication treatment is necessary).  Some doctors will say your body adapts.  They're wrong.  They've never been through it but just parrot the same lines everyone else parrots without knowing.  You may (may) get a reduction in how tired it makes you, but it doesn't go back to normal by a long shot. 

&#x200B;

There are many other options out there.  You can always come back to Seroquel if it turns out that's the only one that works for you.  But if you just accept it now, you'll never know and will have a very different life.

And if it were me, I'd get a different doctor, too.  In my view, this move is the psychiatric equivalent of the orthopedic surgeon amputating your broken leg before giving you a cast. I'd never trust that person ever again for even mention it, let alone doing it.
