canada,fo8g1q9,t3_g633n3,1587595858.0,The announcement by our PM mentioned that all expiring federal scholarship will be extended.  My sister has a federal scholarship that expires in August 2020. Does that mean her scholarship gets extended for another semester?
nyrbclassics,fn9pvki,t3_g09ne7,1586781432.0,It is great and worth it. I very much recommend it.

india,fjvqvmo,t1_fjt3gcm,1583630060.0,I just did. I had to break it up in two parts. I hope you enjoy reading it.
india,fjt3exh,t1_fjt2upv,1583603417.0,I agree. It is time to boot out MODI and his goons that fester on tribalism and have their entire career centered on divisive politics.
india,fjt34xw,t1_fjsa19r,1583603250.0,Actually it does. Do you like me to PM you the article ?
india,fjt30ox,t1_fjsu8mj,1583603174.0,It seems that your argument is very circuitous and not well constructed. You will want to revisit what /u/nura2011 has laid out again.
india,fjt2q54,t1_fjsrzos,1583602988.0,Very well written! Kudos
india,fjrxsis,t3_fev7ox,1583591258.0,"From the article. Just brilliant : 

The attraction of Indian identity has always been that it allows an individual to be many things at the same time. Modi, forged in an ideology that seeks to boil people down to one identity, is scattering the seeds of disunion in the world’s most diverse democratic union. The threads that bind India are not nearly as formidable as many believe them to be, and they cannot forever bear the burdens of bigotry imposed upon them. India is racing to a point of no return."
universe,fjajfdm,t3_fcgpep,1583174711.0,I am not an expert but I really enjoyed reading your analogy of comparing our reality with the DVD. Kudos to you!
india,fj3r8cw,t1_fj3p5j1,1582991300.0,"India will move on. India is more resilient and has great perseverance. However, under Modi, India will be stuck in an eternity of mindless communal tensions. Modi thrives in this communal tensions and he wants our response (passive response) to be normalized.  India must show the door to Modi and his goons and this will chart a future that is then promising."

kindle,fhhl1kq,t3_f215zs,1581606569.0,"Unfortunately no. It sucks that audible does not work on your oasis if you have an account with amazon.ca 

However if you have one with amazon.com then that may work. Lots of people have tried this and most have reported back that it actually works."
askTO,fdngba0,t1_fdm6rbk,1578585196.0,"Thanks. Probably it was my naiveté that made me look for exactly the same model for replacement that the builder had installed few years back in my condo. However, this is an expensive lesson learnt."
relationships,fdlm4j3,t1_fdliy5a,1578527130.0,"Thanks for posting this . I wish my wife had some strength to confront her family , I basically get little to no time with my baby with her family around. What ever little time I do get, is quickly taken away by her mother or dad wanting to hold the baby."

india,fbbf5is,t1_fbak9a6,1576699155.0,Your argument makes no sense and is just spewing with bigotry. Do you think that Hindus did not perform any atrocities on Muslims during partition?
india,fajz8zx,t3_e9gx7j,1576157812.0,"What alternative universe do you live in? India is worst off than Pakistan under Modi. The rise of Hindutva is troubling, and Modi is making the lives of minorities difficult.  India is no longer a democracy; it is a dictator."
mumbai,f9z67jw,t1_f9x4azm,1575738631.0,It is ok. The ministry of utmost happiness is not meant for everyone. The book is subtle and beautifully written. And yes it does go against gujrat ka Lalla that may be offputting to some readers.
mumbai,f9z5mww,t3_e7a1ux,1575738403.0,Did you read “A little life”? I read it 2 years back and it is one of my favorite. Heart wrenching book. Never felt so sad and full of hope at the same time.

kindle,evfqlxe,t1_evfnk3g,1564499784.0,I agree with you. This makes no sense. Why would someone not go through the official channels and return this to amazon? Rather than sell it for less? This kind of altruistic behavior reeks of spam.
