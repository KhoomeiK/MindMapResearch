I ""chose"" the latter. When you enter your 30s you will find these same uncles and aunties lamenting of their choices to you. They will keep complaining how they ""had to get married..."", and in the very next sentence asking you to do the same thing of which they complain. All I can say is don't fall for their flawed model of life, it is not going to work in the future. 

Also, be very careful of the Indian marriage market. One thing which is never addressed is the convoluted Indian family law. One misstep and men are fucked - literally! Many of my friends who chased after the concept of ""settling down"" are now unsettled. For reference: [Deepika Bharadwaj - She addresses the Indian Dowry Act from the perspective of men.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_2gl7lz25E) There are plenty of other resources and cases online.

This is not to dissuade someone from getting married. However, one must remember marriage is ultimately a contract. There will be a latent distrust which will continue to exist in men because of the inherent risk in this contract.

antinatalism,fny2ffx,t1_fnwizmk,1587351767.0,"This is a very complicated issue, but one thing common in poorer countries is the influence of religion(s), or rather the lack of education to challenge bad ideologies, mostly due to lack of adequate legal mechanisms to protect the one who challenges them. Things are mostly resolved by base acts of threats, thuggery and violence. Advanced countries (mostly the West) have a secular model, and most importantly enforce it, so while people do practice their religion, they have sense to keep it private (in most cases), or can have a voice to criticise ""textbook"" version of their religion. People in the west really take their country's secular model and freedom of speech for granted.

The economic growth should be accompanied by development. One can have a growth rate of 8 to 10% GDP, but if the benefits are not translated into development goals, specifically for bettering human capital in the form of education inclined towards rational thought, it becomes meaningless. I rather compare the set of factors as outlined here [World Bank's Ease of Doing Business](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/doingbusiness) (along with external sources of what is not addressed in this [methodology](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/methodology/common-misconceptions)) than mainstream media's version of fixating over one number of GDP. After all the economy is made of people. 

It is also significantly difficult to make comparisons if we turn the clock back. Many countries weren't in existence a mere 80-100 years ago - most of them being  some European country's colony. Take it back another 200 years, most countries had a feudal system. The definition of poverty is a moving goalpost. The needs and wants of people in different regions will continue to be vastly different. 

I can choose to be a mute spectator, or before my end arrives I can point out my observations (hopefully, with right deductions and evidence) to the living. The good thing is that we have a lot of material in the form of books and research by really smart people (past and current) already out in the open.

Do religions have stories in their holy books about taking care of aging parents?

*""Do they really need to put their children on the hook for the fact that  they didn't plan properly and lacked financial discipline? I thought  debt bondage was banned in all countries. ""*

Poor people don't have an option of ""financial planning"" let alone ""financial discipline"". Try surviving on USD 2-3/day. Some don't even get that much, it will be around USD 1/day. Try supporting a family of 3-5 children, 4 aging parents, 2 adults of which 1 (the male) is the working member. If you are wondering why anyone would want these many children even though they can't sustain, you need to look at the cultural influences, which is directly influenced by the religion of that area.

"" *I thought debt bondage was banned in all countries""*

Many parts of India, Pakistan and other Asian countries still practice it. An example, [Working to end bonded labour in India's brick kilns](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-27588065/working-to-end-bonded-labour-in-india-s-brick-kilns). But you can find in other industries as well.

I understand you have been betrayed. But look at this way, you dodged a bullet, you learned a bigger lesson here for a better future - now you can identify people like her as unreliable, and never associate with the likes of her. 

If it means anything, I am going through a break up myself. But I want to take the positives from the duress and the stress I am going through right now. I want to come out as a better person after I have taken a ride on my emotional rollercoaster."

You are still in a better position - you don't have children. Given that the family courts are terrible with regards to child support. As others have suggested - ditch this shallow person out of your life, and possibly her friend circle who have enabled her to behave in this manner.

Also, you will always find support here. Take care!"

He wants ""modern yet traditional"" type of life. He wants to follow that ""plug and play"" formula which Indian society has drilled- study hard, ONLY engineering or medicine, not out of passion, but to GET MARRIED and POP OUT 2/3 kids, and resign into oblivion.

Initially he liked the western values, chose to date and fuck around, and now conveniently found allure in his Hindu traditions. I have no sympathies for this asshole - better luck in your next reincarnation!
