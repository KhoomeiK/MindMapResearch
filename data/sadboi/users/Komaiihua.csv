Feminism,fj65rce,t3_f9jeob,1583058090.0,"I hate the fact I’m having to type this to begin with but equality is about not having things central to only one gender and removing male/female dominated areas that are dominated that way because it’s harder/not expected of one gender to perform that role. (I’m adding reasons for it being dominated because some roles will be dominated and there’s nothing wrong with that as long as it’s not dominated for reasons aforementioned)

In saying that, that means that makeup shouldn’t be confined to one gender. Both men and women can experiment, wear, buy makeup and there’s no problem with it. So what if when you think of makeup you think of James Charles? That’s because he was one of the first few guys to become famous for wearing makeup and was the first male on cover girl because of it. 

I feel like this post is essentially saying ‘because I don’t know any female makeup artists, makeup is now becoming male dominated and that’s unfair so they shouldn’t be allowed to do this anymore because it hurts women’. What kind of mentality is that supposed to be. Equality means sticking up for people and getting rid of gender stereotypes, not reinforcing them by implying that women should be the only ones know for wearing makeup."

AmItheAsshole,fdv217j,t3_en0zfr,1578742287.0,"ESH but how are you gonna know when she’s responsible enough? She could just lie and say she’s learnt her lesson - I’d let her keep using the car but tell her that it’s her ticket, she can pay the $200. 

Edit: I was with you until you revoked her license because that’s just unfair. She may be acting irresponsible now but saying that she’s gonna remain irresponsible for the next 2 years is ridiculous. This comes across as you just being pissed that the mother agrees with the daughter and is happy to let her drive so revoked her license out of spite."

ADHD,fdk04vn,t1_fdjw524,1578492716.0,"To be honest, I don’t see how my parents relationship would ever go back to what it was like years ago so I don’t even want to try and fix it,, I think sometimes when things don’t work, they might just be unfixable and should just be left. 

I had thought of counselling before so I might try and get something sorted about that. If I’m being honest, when my dad was diagnosed with adhd, we were supposed to be given family counselling on the nhs but it never happened and I think it might be past the point of that helping any of us. 

 Thankfully I’ve only got just over a year until I’m 18 and I’ll be able to move out,, my mental health tends not to suffer as much whenever I’m not around my parents for a while which is good. Thanks for the advice though, I think I’ve got to the point where I actually have to do something for my own sake :)"
unpopularopinion,fda5o1c,t3_ek4w3m,1578242034.0,"Agree. I live in the uk and I’m sure I’d heard that the bbc heavily supports conservatives so is more lenient on publishing news that paints them in a negative light. A lot of facts that younger generations see online, older generations will see on tv or in newspapers which are biased and often fake, leading to votes made under false pretences."

awfuleverything,fd5zuea,t1_fd40vyv,1578183592.0,Wasn’t there that girl on YouTube who talked openly about doing this and she was explaining ‘reasons why letting your dog eat you out is beneficial’ and videos with tips on “making it better” but she went viral and was fired because of it. I’m sure I’d heard that she lost all her friends and family when they found out and she made an apology video or something which was just her crying for 10 mins about nothing.

AmItheAsshole,fcx9v9n,t1_fcw23yd,1578056778.0,"Jumping on this comment because I agree. It would cause added stress to everyone but I wonder if they could FaceTime the sister during the ceremony so she could watch it, still technically be a part of it, but put the phone on mute so nothing disruptive happens. It sounds like a dick move but it could be a compromise and it would mean the sister isn’t in a loud/crowded place because she’d be watching from home."
niceguys,fcx901h,t3_ejcjuc,1578055927.0,"First, that’s creepy as hell, second, please report this, if a number is on a file and used for unspecified purposes, such as this, it is breaking data protection laws which can lead to serious repercussions to the company if this was repeated on multiple occasions. This happening once and having the correct punishment by dealing with the guy who messaged you means the company will be fine."
