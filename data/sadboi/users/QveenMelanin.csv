braincancer,fngoeib,t1_fngllu1,1586939028.0,I live in Edinburgh. In the Neuroscience building it was quiet. But I suppose that’s because MRI and CT aren’t needed in cases of the rona. But all the office car parks around the hospital for about a mile have opened their car parks for hospital staff and people. And they are packed.

braintumor,fl1j7sg,t1_fl0reyv,1584730076.0,Those feelings are really common so don’t beat yourself up. I had my first symptoms about 6 months ago and for the whole time I felt in limbo. I didn’t want to tell my children (20 and 16) because I didn’t have all the results so it was only my husband and I who have carried the burden. I feel like all I do is apologise to my husband. I learned to take each day at a time. Your wife and you will find strength in each other and you will find hope in your children’s eyes. Trust me x

UnsentLetters,ffidoy1,t3_etqnqu,1579971407.0,"I had to make that decision with my eldest dog on Mother’s Day last year. I put my head on hers and told her “forever”. She licked my nose as if to say goodbye. For 13 years she had been my sidekick and that decision was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do- and to be honest, life hasn’t been the same without her. And I still miss her terribly. It would be wrong to say that the pain goes away. But the memories she left me with out way the pain left by her leaving. I am sending you so much love and strength. xxx they will always be by your side. I know Poppy is by mine x"

Aquariums,f4svlem,t1_f4qyx74,1571781278.0,Hi. Angels are cichlids and do prefer to live in groups. Usually about 6 but you can go as low as 3. But the bigger the group the less chance of them being aggressive to each other. One on its own probably with become aggressive over time so best not kept with small fish x and remember they can get big x they are wonderful fish x
