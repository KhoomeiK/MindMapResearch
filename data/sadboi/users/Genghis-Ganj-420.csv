I’m not a hugely social person, at all. Have a fairly large amount of anxiety even as I’m typing this. So talking to people about these things is nearly impossible. Especially when all your going to get back when reaching out is just a quippy “it’ll be okay” response. Making me feel like I have nowhere to turn. Since I too, am too afraid to commit suicide. I sometimes think about a car just taking me out, out of nowhere. 

With all that said, I love each and every single one of you on here. Know that!! You are loved!!"
