bipolar,fh9qb09,t1_fh9mbbi,1581387190.0,Thanks I totally agree. My issue here though is more one of which plan do I execute which is ultimately an emotional decision. Do I stay and try to rebuild the old life I thought I was gonna have or do I just cut ties now and start over.  Both have serious consequences that I might regret later and that is paralyzing to me...

I was more F in college but am definitely more T now, I‚Äôve always been more N and the E and I is a slight preference for E so those three I‚Äôm confident in I.e ENT.  With confidence and in my natural state I‚Äôm probably a P but insecurity, anxiety and depression make me prefer J.  The two formalized tests I‚Äôve taken were ENTJ in 8th grade and ENFJ in college.  I think since becoming an adult and not doing everything the way my parents taught me has let me loosen up a bit. I still don‚Äôt know whether I prefer P or J but the problem with these tests is that they try to slot you into one of 16 types based on 5 dichotomies and the variables that make up your personality are far more complex than that.  At this moment I can confidently say I act more and connect more with the ENTP but can comfortably slide into ENTJ mode when necessary. But I want to be liked üòÇ don't hate me I'm bipolar"

To me there is no ""point"" to life as I'm not religious. I believe we were dropped into an infinite universe by forces we cannot ever control nor fully understand.  The beauty of this is that we get to decide for ourselves what we want to create with our lives... And therein lies our greatest strength, creation.  Apart from what we create physically we can also create connections with our fellow travelers as thankfully we are not dropped into this world alone.  Perhaps you need more time to learn what it is you want the ""point"" or purpose of your life to be, but you are in control of your journey.  Until then keep learning, searching and making connections and perhaps ultimately the endless pursuit of the ""point"" is the only point you'll ever need."

BipolarReddit,f9qltz9,t3_e6j8e8,1575563287.0,"When I got diagnosed I was initially put on 900mg of lithium, ativan and the anti-psychotic perphenazine to keep me ""glued"" together as my psych put it.  They also started the process of getting my body adapted to the lamotrigine. The crazy thing is I was still hypo-manic even on all those meds.  After a few weeks psych told me I didn't need the anti-psychotic anymore because the lithium was doing it... lo and behold I got manic again so  and eventually got upped to 1200 and then 1500mg lithium until I was able to get off the anti-psychotic.  That did affect my body quite a bit and gave me twitches.  After many many months I finally got tapered off the lithium and was just on lamotrigine for a while but I still had debilitating depression and I also have generalized anxiety disorder so my anxiety returned to the worst its ever been.  It never occurred to me that it could've been the lamotrigine.  The therapy and CBT just wasn't doing it so eventually he put me on Lexapro which made the depression worse for two weeks until it got better and I've been stable on those two meds since then with the occasional ativan.  Really the lexapro is the only thing that fixed the anxiety/depression and the lamotrigine is protection against mania.  Thats my experience and I hope it helps you.  You will get better and have a functioning life again because you are doing the right things, getting help and taking your meds as prescribed.  It took me over a year and everyone says the first year is the hardest to figure out what works for your body."
