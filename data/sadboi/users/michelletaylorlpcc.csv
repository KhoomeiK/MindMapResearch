GetMotivated,evut2bh,t1_evaz5j1,1564805334.0,"It might help to write down what you miss about it. Sometimes when we try to suppress things, we want it more, when really it just needs to be heard. So, let it out! Talk about ALL the things, if you're open to sharing. I'm here to hear :-)"
GetMotivated,evuqqlu,t3_ckxcj4,1564803168.0,I LOVE David Goggins. His book was the best on Audible. He inspired me to run my first half marathon while dealing with multiple sclerosis. Harden your mind. No excuses. :-)
GetMotivated,evupuoa,t3_cj3kfk,1564802386.0,"I got approved for a multiple sclerosis clinical trial! I am so excited to help the bigger cause. I've had MS for 2 years... been fighting the symptoms for 6.... and working through the mental health part of it, while being a mental health therapist! Anyways, looking forward for medical advances for the disease and I'm glad to be a part of the journey!"
Anxiety,evs0ivv,t3_ckzocu,1564724850.0,"I hope it went well. Remember that for both you and the therapist, you are new to each other, so both of you are probably experiencing ""first meeting"" nerves... Which is totally normal! Anxiety gremlins make us believe things are scarier than they actually are. Plus, the therapist is hopefully trained to help you feel comfortable... It's your own safe space to explore whatever you want :-) good luck!"
AskWomen,euxr5jx,t3_ch90dp,1564090754.0,"It's funny how we treat ourselves much worse than our friends. I always try to talk to myself like I was a friend. What would you tell your best friend if he/she were going through the same thing? Beating yourself up only makes you feel more like shit. When you feel like shit, you oftentimes think you deserve shit. But, you don't. Start with compassion for yourself. Just like you would for your best friend. You did the best you could at that time."
relationships,euxpbqx,t3_chrx7f,1564090151.0,"An boundary set now will be uncomfortable.

Enabling this kind of behavior will lead to contempt and resentment.

You choose which one you want to feel."
self,euwg0di,t3_chjbxm,1564074791.0,"Love this! I know it is so painful now, but remember how it feels to be heard and make that your new standard for all relationships in your life. You can teach others how you want to be heard... just takes a little prompting. And also, thank the universe for sending her to you to teach you all this! I am a licensed therapist, and I believe some of the best therapists are young and new. You lucked out! The pain will get better... but the lessons you learned will never go away. <3"
Anxiety,euw59gr,t3_chl6gx,1564070627.0,"I also experienced this. It's those gremlins in your head that cause you to doubt yourself. I think if you just look at those doubts as information, like, ""Okay, I hear you... but, what I say matters and it needs to be heard."" then maybe it helps them feel heard. It's weird to talk to your thoughts like people... but, it works!

I also love Brene Brown's quote that she got from Theodore Roosevelt: "" 

# A lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. They just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. The problem is, when we stop caring what people think and stop feeling hurt by cruelty, we lose our ability to connect. But when we’re defined by what people think, we lose the courage to be vulnerable. Therefore, we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. For me, if you’re not in the arena getting your ass kicked, I’m not interested in your feedback."""

self,euiied4,t3_cggswe,1563848432.0,"Hi! I often feel this... and p.s. what's ""shed hunting"" :-) 

I think there are many different levels of passions... so if you're not making all the time in the world for it, it's not that it's not a passion, just not the biggest passion. It's like love... there are so many different levels of it...

Also, it's probably hard to find new things in a small town. Do you remember a time in your life when you felt passionate, even about a person or a place? Might give you lots of information about what moves you."

socialskills,eui4qmq,t1_euhkw2q,1563840379.0,">Supporting and respecting someone's ideology and listening to someone's ideology are two different things, in my opinion. I can hear many kinds of things as a therapist... build rapport with the client... and not support their beliefs personally.

> My point is not to enable opinions that threaten others, but to listen to them, help them feel heard so there possibly could be some positive discourse. I believe when people don't listen, they shut down and become firmer in their sometimes irrational beliefs. There are sometimes outside of being a therapist, where I let my listening skills down, and it ends up ugly. I've found when people feel heard and understood, they are more prone to see the other side. If not heard, they dig their heels further and further into their ""truth"" and nothing is accomplished.

socialskills,euhkhyr,t1_euhk1gn,1563828998.0,It's tough... it takes a lot of listening skills on both ends. Which unfortunately doesn't happen much now-a-days. I'm trying to help bridge that gap.
