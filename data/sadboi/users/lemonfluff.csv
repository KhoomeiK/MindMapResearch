>But that fear, and thought of someone down playing what was going on was still there. 

Yes this so much!! The fear of people downplaying it, like you're making a big deal over nothing, so real. I think that's something people also experience with sexual assault, no one wants their very valid and real experiences to be invalidated. 

>I was in this fog for awhile too. Here‚Äôs another tidbit of my life lol, after we broke up the first time, another ex of mine (great wonderful man, can‚Äôt sing his praises enough) and I got back together and ended up getting engaged.

Honestly that sounds so great for helping you heal, even if it didn't work out in the end. Especially because he knew and dated you before the abusive relationship, so could make comparisons. It must have been weird for him to notice all these new unhealthy behaviours and so helpful for you to have those pointed out and be able to address them knowing that they were a direct result of that relationship and so we're unhelpful and you could get rid of them!

>I have no doubt in my mind that he told his friends I was the issue. Same ol story. I know for a fact he told a girl that I straight left him out of the blue to be with an ex from my past...not even close. Real story being, he flipped because I went to visit my sister in college, he couldn‚Äôt handle it, and threatened to come over yell at me and God knows what else and kill himself. That‚Äôs the real story, not some fallen victim hero bs he was spewing. Knowing this, even having the evidence of it, I will never expose him to his friends like that, they‚Äôll see it in their own time.

That's terrible. Well done for leaving :) he sounds awful.

I also worked with my ex - terrible idea! 

>(I still have an issue saying I was abused, I still leave that word to people who are physically abused like what they go thru is significantly greater then what I did),

Oh yes I can really relate to this. I only started using the words after several friends used it, but is till find it hard to say, like I'm lying. But it definitely sounds abusive to me what you went through. If it makes you feel more in control, own it. 


>and even though he understood his pushy ness to get into a relationship troubled me because, that‚Äôs what my ex did.

Yes that's what this new guy is Doing. He wanted a relationship really fast, like within a couple of weeks and we had a big argument about it because I still wanted to take it slow and speak to other people. Now it's been a couple of months and we're both taking it slow and I'm the one that's starting to think about a relationship but I'm still not sure if it's a red flag that he wanted to jump into one so fast at the start to the point we argued about it. I do like him tho.

>Relationships do require work but not the type of work that I‚Äôm guessing both of us went through.


Yes everyone always says that relationships are hard but this always felt SO hard. 

>I actually down played a lot of what was going on because there was one part of me that just couldn‚Äôt see what was going on, and after I did, the other part was embarrassed & thought no one would think it was a big deal and couples just go through this.

I did this so much. My biggest worry now is that people still won't agree with what I'm saying or will think I'm just the ""crazy ex gf"" who can't let go or is bitter. It's really hard to explain some of the things that happened because I go blank when out on the spot and my mind blocks it out, but it did happen. And it's hard entering a new relationship now to know what are Red flags and what are just normal things in a relationship. 

When my ex left me I talked to a couple of his friends at the time about some things I was unhappy about and they basically said I needed to move on and made it seem like I was clinging to him and speaking bad about him because I was angry at the break up. ""everyone feels angry at their ex when they break up, there's always two sides"" but really, it was so much more than that, but they could only see the best side of him. I realised right before we broke up that he was bad mouthing me to his friends and family as well and probably had been for a long time, changing details in the story, ommiting really important facts or essential lying about what happened.

But yeah, people thinking it's nbd and that every couple go through this and then not understanding why it's effected me so much and why it still does 3 years later... That's really upsetting. My family still love my ex and talk about him. His friends loved him.  I don't think they'd believe me if I told them what he was like, because even I find it so hard to pair that person up with who he seemed like at first and in public.

>The minute I told a close friend just a handful of things that happened it was confirmed to me. It didn‚Äôt matter that he had good days and bad days, one certainly outweighed the other and it was a game of anticipation to see what version I was going to get that day.

I'm so happy you spoke to someone. Well done girl, that's more than I did. It's hard to admit what's been going on. 

>It was also hard because people close to him didn‚Äôt seem to see a different person, and I didn‚Äôt want to sound crazy by exposing him as someone different

This so much! You hear so many stereotypes of crazy exes as well... Specifically girls. I never wanted to be painted as one of those, which I know is how he painted me to his friends and family and almost definitely his next gf. Its really hard when you're the only one that sees this other side to them, and then they DENY it happening, or they say they only acted like that because YOU made them. It's literally only you who witnesses is and they're making you question your own memory. 

I don't even know how to begin telling my new guy about what happened. Its hard to find really concrete examples of clear cut abuse and I'm worried he'll take my exes side or think I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I've told him my last relationship was emotionally abusive but I haven't gone into details. I feel like everyone says their relationship was emotionally abusive, often without really knowing what it means, so people just dismiss it. I'm worried that he wil think I am just trying to paint myself as an eternal victim, especially because I've had some assaulty things happen since that out me offff men anf sex for a long time, but that weren't technically rape, but just almost. And I'm sick sometimes which can be hard to deal with, but it's something a lot fo people have and seem to cope fine with. But somehow it is a lot harder for me t manage than most people with the disease. I just don't want people to think I have a victim complex. It's something a friend mentioned once (well I mentioned it and he was like, maybe you DO) and he was the one I shared a lot of these thoughts and emotions with. It's hard when you're always questioning your own judgement /perceptions /memories

>I‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôve taken the steps to take care of yourself and see that you needed to separate yourself from your situation.

You sound very reasonable and mature tbh. I don't really think your gf is TA either, she just forgot about your call and is maybe a bit scatterbrained. But it does suggest that she's maybe not taking it very seriously and considering you communicated to her that it was important to you, she didn't see to listen.

Technically it's your house yes, but tbbh whilst she is living there it is her home too. She should be making compromises so you can work from home, and whilst it's her home too, it's also your office so she needs to respect that. But yes you should definitely tell her that whilst she lives here it is her home. How is she gonna feel if this is a trial living together? When you move in together properly will it still not be her home if she doesn't pay equal bills? Will it still not be her space?"

It might give you a better understanding of what is and isn't healthy behaviour and healthy coping mechanisms. Also if you stay together please consider couples therapy. Or maybe individual therapy.

Understand that getting slapped by a stronger partner is terrifying, and even if you never do it again she will always wonder if you will, and it may stop her saying what she actually means, or may make her react violently to situations.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fqman13,t1_fqh3b4m,1589474305.0,"> It isn't ""often"" 2 guys fighting and a woman trying to stop them, it's almost always men fighting each other and some random woman in the backround screeches which is what the comments talk about.

It's not a random woman, it's usually the girlfriend. And even if it's a random woman, that is exactly what I said. You literally just confirmed it.

I mean how is ""men fighting each other and some random woman in the background"" screeching"""" NOT 2 guys fighting and a woman trying to stop them? 

That's LITERALLY what it is. 

>No they do not. They criticize the woman for screaming at the top of their lungs while doing absolutely nothing else. Also, why would they criticize the guys fighting if that's the entire point of the sub, to watch fights?

And what is she meant to do? Throw herself into flailing limbs? No, all she can do is shout at them to stop which is more than any of the other onlookers / the idiot filming does. Where's the criticism towards him?

They critisise the woman for not breaking it up (you said so yourself - ""while doing nothing else"") so they should be criticising the guys fighting 100 fold more. Anything else is hypocritical af. But it literally is just hating on women, the ""she didn't break it up ad was screeching"" is just an excuse to let the mysogeny out. Hence why they don't also criticise the guys who are fighting for not breaking it up.

""I feel anxious because you seem to only want me for sex"". Completely valid (and apparently true) concern, puts up reasonable boundary and solution for this.

So op has a very normal reaction to a situation and is told its bad mental health and that he won't adjust for it.

This screams
  boy does something horrible to girl

girl is upset

boy gets mad that girl is upset ""omg why are you upset, there must be something wrong with you, you're being unreasonable"". 

Firstly, anxiety is not always a disorder, it's a natural defense mechanism that is there for a reason, I would say ops feelings are proportional to her situation, this is not a disorder. 

Secondly even if she had uncontrollable anxiety, he should be making adjustments to help her cope with it, not just telling her to deal with it."
relationships,fqjg10p,t3_gj3oea,1589409423.0,"This reads as manipulation to me tbh. Your feelings are totally valid and make total sense.

Maybe he's not JUST after sex but this really does seem like a red flag. He's basically said he won't just be with you on an emotional level, unless sex is also involved, so I kinda think he does just want sex, or at least he isn't willing to prioritise anything above sex.

I don't like the way he's making you feel and doubt yourself at all. If he's a mature adult who cares about you he should be listening to your concerns and taking them seriously and should be willing to wait. Not to mention the fact that after only 2 weeks (and no you are definitely NOT out of the courting stage!) he is not making effort anymore and is making you doubt yourself and not spending quality time with you.

I think her brother has an addiction. And he has a condition where he is legally allowed to drive despite the drinking.

My question would be, how long would he be supposed to wait? We don't know how reliable feeling seizures coming on is. Maybe it's hard to tell and sometimes there isn't one. Maybe it's hours later it happens. It might be it was a passing thought of ""there's might be a seizure coming. Best get home quick"" or ""wonder if I'll sieze soon"" and in hindsight he's realised he'd been aware of it. Thinking about it and feeling sure one is coming are very different in the moment but can feel the same in hindsight. 

I think with these things you can become desensitised as well. It's easy as an outsider ti go ""I would NEVER drive or go near my car if I even thought I might seize"" but maybe he gets these feelings quite a lot. Idk about epilepsy but with diabetes low blood sugars can feel very similar to lots of normal feelings and symptoms. So you can mistake a lot of things for maybe going low (eg sweating). So often I'll think ""is that the heat or could I be dropping?"" and often it's just the heat. This might not be the case but I can imagine of it is that he might not put too much stock into the ""feeling"" of a seizure coming on, in which case its only really in hindsight that he's realising how risky driving back was.

He had possibly frozen food in the car, he was the only one who could do it, at a time where wee only meant to go to the shops once a week per family, it was a 5 minute drive and he thought he had time. We don't really know how sure he was about the possibility of a seizure coming, obviously if he thought it was immenent he should not have driven but he clearly thought it was not.

I think it's a more nuanced situation than people who have not experienced this might think."

Half the time I think I might go low I dont, and half the time I have time, its unpredictable. But if I did crash and was not working I would be very upset with you demanding I pay considering I am sick. Your brother cannot help his condition. He is the only one that can do that shop, he was helping the family. Factors might make it easier for him to manage the condition but actually, ultimately he cannot always without fail know for sure exactly when he will have a seizure, with or without alcohol or whatever else impacts it.

Please talk to a trusted adult or friend, and set these boundaries. You should know very quickly how he takes that, if he respects the boundaries and backs off or if he ignores them or escalates. Then you also have a concrete thing to go back to that trusted adult / friend with and say ""you know how we talked about setting these boundaries? He has ignored them"".

Idk though, but yeah I don't think this sounds OK at all and that seeks like an easy test but also if it is ""innocent"" (which I don't think it is), it will make him aware that you will not put up with it."

AskMen,fpkdb65,t1_fpk082p,1588692596.0,"I'm sorry if this sounds really insensitive, but what upset you about her laughing that you were finishing yourself off?

I could see myself laughing if I saw my bf finishing himself off after sex (which happens a fair bit because he has trouble cumming), but not AT him, just like, it's cute, it's funny. I'd probably go cuddle him.

I'm guessing that wasn't the way she did that though? Or is it the association of the laugh with what you found right after, and what that represents in terms of her cheating and cuckolding etc?"

The girl might befriend other kids, one of the parents might make a comment to her that might really upset and confuse her, or the other kids might make comments, having heard from their parents that her Mum is dead and she's here with her Dad. And to top it off, at some point they're gonna see the girl at the park with her actual mum or dad and they're gonna have lots of questions. 

Or the girl is gonna say that op is not her Dad, he's a family friend or something and raise some serious red flags. The other parents are then going to be EVEN MORE mistrusting and paranoid about being lied to. And the girl might get a lot of questions or be ostracised. The parents might not let their kids play with her or stay over etc."
