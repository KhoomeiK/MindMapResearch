tulsi,fheq8l0,t3_f2td7a,1581527677.0,"Maybe she provides a cover for Bernie by staying in the race & doesn’t necessarily take away votes from Bernie. If she drops out then the establishment fully focuses all their fire on Bernie, at least this way she can still defend him as a fellow candidate & not just a surrogate. I’m sure they’ll unite at the convention & Tulsi will bring in a lot more voters to Bernie in the general if she continues to build her base. So keep donating to her. And also, she didn’t underperform, she was severely & unfairly treated. You don’t have to donate if you don’t want to and you can use your flawed logic & broken heart to dissuade others here if you want, but she won’t drop out. You either have her 6 or you don’t.

You got the President of the United States going out of his way to recognize Tulsi. How often does Trump say he respects any opponent, especially one who just censured him?
