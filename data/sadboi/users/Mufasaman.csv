ADHD,fptkjki,t1_fpt3icc,1588892973.0,"A couple insights reading this, so when you were misdiagnosed with MDD/Anxiety they probably put you on SSRI’s or something similar, which in themselves often cause horrible rapid and mixed cycling in underlying bipolar patients, often leading to a meltdown. Many people with BD discover their misdiagnosis through this painful process, especially if they are BD2 and exhibit a lot more depression and and less severe hypomanic symptoms. So adding stimulants on top of that would very much compound the uncontrolled mania side effects and ensuing meltdown.

Whereas, if someone is already stable with mood stabilizers and/or anti-psychotics these negative side effects and risks can be mitigated. Additionally if they are 2 versus 1, that worst case scenario is less dire, and up periods are shorter. I was in a much worse place on SSRI’s and Effexor/Straterra than Lamictal/APs/Adderall."

Yeah, the weeks are cherry-picked, but that is still over half the season, and the only better 9 game cherry-picked spans that I found were for sure better were Wilson’s first 9 games:

Additionally it supposedly takes ~5 days to start to show symptoms, so 1M people in the US would have had to be infected ~24 days ago. (1M would of had to be before even this in reality because the 14k deaths didn’t just materialize today, but napkin math) Most studies are estimating a doubling time of 6 days.  So we could have seen 24/6 = 4 potential doubling periods in the mean time, assuming unimpeded growth in the population. 2^4 = 16, times that 1M, = 16 million currently infected estimated, and I could easily imagine 20M+ when factoring additional variables like asymptomatic carriers and more accurate time periods, etc. I’m sure I’m missing some substantial factors though."

Excelling at those categories doesn’t make someone more or less right or knowledgeable about a topic, but they are some of the fundamental building blocks of being able to learn a topic or become successful.
