He said casually to the little girl, they sat on the bench in front of the large painting, and for some reason he started to talk about the unbearable weight he had been forced to carry since time began.

He talked and he talked to the little girl for what seemed like hours, and all she did was silently look forward at the paintings and listen to the weary demon.  The little girls tiny voice cut through his endless Babel and she said ‚ÄúMommy and Daddy died this year, and my eyes stopped working in the accident that took them. My auntie takes me here it‚Äôs quiet, every where else is to loud for me now.‚Äù She said quietly as she drifted to sleep hugging the arm of the demon.  ‚Äú Your nice.‚Äù She said, before she began to quietly snore. 

Her words cut through him faster than a thousand demonic torture methods. He tried not to cry, she was wrong.....dead wrong.....he wasn‚Äôt nice. Up until now he had been unfamiliar with the concept. But For the first time ever he felt the urge to be nice. He didn‚Äôt want her to be wrong. 

‚ÄúOkay..okay I can‚Äôt fix the whole dead parents thing policy is still policy, but maybe I can fix her vision.‚Äù He thought to himself as he gently laid the sleeping little girl on the bench and tapped her shoulder. Magic began to move from his fingers like a snake and she was suddenly cloaked in a blistering light that blinded the rest of the room and caused a panic. Amidst the chaos the demon kneeled over and tearfully whispered his thanks to the sleeping girl. As he left the room he saw the girls aunt run screaming into the room hearing the noise from outside.  As he walked out of the room he felt happy. he had fixed her vision, and as a little treat he had given half of his cosmic power to the girl. Those stupid angels don‚Äôt get to change the world for the better all the time. Score one for the bad guys!!!"

Luckily for me people get very talkative when you start waving a knife around.

I violently grab at him.he panics as I grab him by the back of the coat and he nervously starts talking like a machine gun ‚ÄúMommy told me that a ghost ended everything. She said that it one day looked at the corruption and the filth it saw in all of us.‚Äù   The Scavenger looked off into the ruined landscape fighting back fine glass like tears.  ‚ÄúShe said the ghost used the power of something called n-u-c-l-e-a-r bomb to punish us. Sorry he said dabbing his eyes with a rag. She would talk about how beautiful the world was before. I would give all me shiny metal for a chance to see that beauty for five minutes.‚Äù

I drop the little man, and walk off numb.I look around and know that I caused the apocalypse. You see I can put my body into autopilot. I‚Äôm super human when I do, and used it hundreds of times to gain the upper hand and never suffered any damage. I guess when I did it to clean the house I said the wrong words. 

But I think I can fix this, I just need a spot to lay down. After pacing back and forth for what seemed like hours. I finally find a place on the dirty irradiated ground. I plop down,close my eyes, and shout into the cold void around me ‚Äúfix this mess .‚Äù I hope it works I think to myself as I drift into autopilot and the rubble and ruin of this world is drowned out by a blanket of white light."
