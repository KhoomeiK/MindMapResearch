It's a natural areas restoration non profit and half of the workers have business / communications jobs and the other half have more of the science skills and background. I was browsing their bios to see what kind of careers would best fit me and I think I could see myself being the person who does ecological assessments and studies and also helps with the physical conservation portion, but I'm not entirely sure yet because 1. I dont know what ecological assessments look like and 2. I've never had a job or internship doing those sorts of things full time. So I think those two jobs are conservation scientist and something like conservationer/forester.   So with that said, I'm under the impression that for the forester position, I would need a bachelor's and some experience I guess through an internship and/or maybe even some kind of americorps like experience and for the conservation scientist position, I would need a master's and experience. The master's would serve as experience needed for positions where only a bachelor's is needed but with experience on the side. It just seems like so much work just to have a career that doesnt pay that much. My end goal isnt even to make in the six figures, maybe high 5s. I can see why you recommended the engineering route, but I'm not sure if I even want to spend time and energy considering that alternate route.

However, I can almost guarantee that this stuff wont be relevant for my future or major. The idea of taking classes where the information is useless for my future is something i dont want to experience, especially considering that college isnt free, you know?

I feel like with math, a lot of the times unless you're a math major, you wont need the content for the future. So my follow up question for you is that would you say that it's like that in general for every class even if the classes relate to your major? Are the classes at SBU hard because they're making you learn a lot useful info or are they hard because they're making you learn a lot of useless info?"

I'm definitely not getting much out of community college, but I am enjoying how little work I have to do. I'm with you there. I think part of why I'm happy is because I'm planning to transfer somewhere either way, so I feel like it's almost a loophole to go to community college and be able to transfer to a school that I might not have been able to attend had I applied back when I was in high school. 

But the thing I'm trying to figure out is what kind of challenge will I be getting at SBU or any school for that matter. Will I just be challenged in a useless way by just having to study a whole bunch of stuff that wont relate to my career or will I challenged by being required to learn a lot of useful content"
SBU,fior79k,t1_fioocxc,1582589087.0,"The thing I'm worried about though is honestly studying for a majority of stuff I wont need in the future and just studying altogether because here at community college, I feel like I'm spoiled because I can just show up to class and not study and earn high grades. 

I want to get a feel for what exactly is meant when people say Stony Brook is well known for STEM. Is it because the classes are tough? Is it because STEM students learn much more necessary things for their majors? Stuff like that. I dont want to go to an academically rigorous school to study all day when I could go to a relaxed school, graduate and have the same opportunities lined up. 

 The thing is that I want to transfer from community college because while the classes are easy, I dont feel like I really fit in. Many students here are at different stages of their lives. Some are older folks, some barely know why they're going to class. I want to meet people who share my values and meet people who are going to really make a difference. 

Thanks for the reply by the way, you're really helping me with coming up with factors that go into the transfer process!"

selfimprovement,feve350,t3_eqikuo,1579396372.0,"I'll try my best to shoot you some ideas. I think I've done a pretty good job at finding myself. 

1. Spend more time outside. The more you're exposed to, the more reactions you have and the more information you can gather from yourself after. Try new things!

2. Get rid of certain stumuli. This sounds counterintuitive considering the first point, but what I mean by this is that you need to be mindful in order to think - to learn about yourself. Spending less time browsing the internet aimlessly to satisfy boredom like scrolling through instagram or YouTube and whatnot gives you more time and more mindfulness. Same goes for listening to music. Music is powerful and has the power to move us in so many ways, but it's also a big distraction that can sedate us and zone us out for a while. Video games too. You get the point.

3. Have conversations with people. Ask questions, have meaningful discussions. This also helps deepen your friendships. We're becoming less social in person and less trusting and turn to strangers for help. Its backwards. You're supposed to be trusting your friends with your issues instead. But everyone is afraid of judgement because we cant trust one another because we dont know how to speak to one another or how to deepen a friendship or how to trust one another or how to spend time with one another because things like our phones are addicting. Endless cycle of loneliness, not knowing how to interact with people as a result of being a shut in and all that. When you speak with people, you learn about them, and you can use them to foil yourself. If your friend is loud, you might learn that you're quiet for example."
selfimprovement,fevca0z,t3_eqp8be,1579395720.0,"So accurate.

I feel like most things are common sense and the rest you just have to figure out eirher by being really introspective and mindful or by doing some quick online searches.
