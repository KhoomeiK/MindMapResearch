Wigs,fnav8uk,t3_g0p7lp,1586804417.0,It’s actually a very light purple color! Like a lavender! I love it. It was about $20.00 on Amazon! Many good reviews! I love it and the length! I cut the bangs as they were a bit too long! I’ve been wearing wigs for years now and I decided to go with one with bangs because I’m not a huge fan of having to glue my lace fronts on all the time. In all honesty I’m not very good at it and probably need practice 😅
