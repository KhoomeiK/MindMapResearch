I make it a double date by inviting my friend and her boyfriend. 

I pull up to the parking lot and let him know I’m there. A skinny little boy walks out from between the cars with a strut inspired by anime. I’m quirky and nerdy too so I don’t batt an eye but it was a red flag. I introduce him to my friend in line for the comedy club and I notice he’s acting shifty and nervous.

Excuse me, he supposedly is 22. I ask him how old he is and he’s only 17! Ok, dammit, I paid for these tickets so I’m gonna use them. 

He’s the same age as my little brother so it was easy to switch to platonic big sister mode and still have a good night. I sent him home early because I planned on going to some bars after and obviously he couldn’t join me.

What makes people unique, cool, and well liked has nothing to do with how smart or tortured they are. You have to lift people up and treat them with respect as if you find them intelligent, helpful, funny, and kind. Validate people and they will do it back.

Anxiety,fh8o75m,t3_f1s25w,1581363902.0,I’m really good at projecting my voice and public speaking for a brief periods but I can feel my anxiety spiking inside. I just had to introduce myself to my class last week and my Fitbit said my heart rate was at 125 when I spoke. It’s usually around 80.
