BPD,f8sncix,t1_f8rqpom,1574784821.0,Thanks for the advice! for some reason it's been happening alot lately. It's like it's all happening to someone else. I'll try these techniques out
CompetitiveTFT,f635olk,t3_dqdks2,1572671948.0,Very interesting results! It would be nice to get some kind of confirmation from Riot saying that slots do work independently to select unit cost. Overall very nice job :)
BPD,f5ljx3v,t1_f5d5lhx,1572279488.0,I really relate to this too. Recognizing what I'm actually feeling is so hard sometimes. The thoughts often take control and I find myself making an effort to stop them and think about what I'm really feeling. Then when I pinpoint what I'm feeling out it's easier to take control back. This has all been thanks to my therapist's help tho!

CompetitiveTFT,f2nkmmc,t3_ddppwh,1570317186.0,I really appreciate content like this. Keep it up!
