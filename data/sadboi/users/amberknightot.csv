The ones who liked the nuclear and solar energy courses went into energy (they did these courses after their choice but essentially made the choice SO that they could do these courses).

But you should sit down with him and let him know how hurtful his disappearances are and it also hurts to see him like this. Print out some info on resources for alcoholics in your area, show to his face what getting help looks like. If he says he doesn't want to do it for himself, ask him if he'll do it for his daughter. You may not like the idea but threatening to call CPS (with the suggestion you'll be taken away from him) if he doesn't get help might be the kick up the arse he needs. And if he doesn't fall through with getting help... I think you should actually call CPS. They're there to help you and often it doesn't mean being taken away from your father.

You shouldn't have to sit your Dad down like this but unfortunately you have to be the adult in this kind of situation. There is hope to convince him to get help but you can't force him to get help. Just know your options.

But there are other type of cognitive behavioural therapies like DBT, Dialectical Behavioural Therapy. I don't know a whole lot about it other than some people turn to it when CBT isn't working. Talk to your psychologist about how no matter how hard you try, the way you're doing things right now isn't working and you need to try something else. It doesn't even have to be DBT it could just be a different approach within CBT. But be honest with your psychologist.

[Horizontal lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau%27s_lines) could mean a whole plethora of things. You get them during chemo, it could be an underlying condition, due to malnutrition, as a result of trauma (like biting) to the cuticle. Generally though, if you've never had them before and you got them around when all this started, it's just another symptom of whats happening to your body."
relationship_advice,fms0box,t1_fmrjhhu,1586342110.0,"Then don't tell them you think you're being poisoned. Go to the doctor and say ""I am going through hell, I feel so sick. Please test me and find out what it is"". Only mention the suspicion of poison if they tell you some poison showed up on the tests. If poison doesn't show up and they put it down to allergy, go on an [elimination diet](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/elimination-diet).

Do all this WITHOUT your girlfriend or her sister knowing. Lie through your teeth if you have to. If they know you're getting tested (and they are in fact poisoning you) they will go through your mail and throw out any letters they see from the doctor. Make sure the doctor gives you test results either over the phone or by email, and make sure your gf can't possibly access either.

Only tell them when you're going on the elimination diet. Say it's doctors orders and that you need strict control over your own diet. Don't let them know what foods you're going to introduce through the weeks and when you'll introduce them. Don't give them control."

2 bags of crisps

5 chocolate bar rappers

3 banana/orange peels

74 cigarette butts

2 balls of tin foil

1 pen

etc

University,fmoozgg,t3_fwjney,1586265257.0,"You need a t shirt for at least every day, if you don't sweat or smell often you could maybe wear a t shirt two days in a row. Most trousers you can get away with wearing for 2 or 3 days.

It's good to get in the routine of washing your clothes every week but depending on how many clothes you own you can get away with less frequent.

So *at minimum*, 7 t shirts and 4 pairs of trouser/jeans. But you'd probably want more but that's your minimum.

Then the pianist of  Señalados comes on and say ""Oh it's great to see people still love our music"" but never confirms that the photo is the bands photo.

Although the photos that the band does have shows the men look very like the men in this photo."
