I almost checked myself into a hospital it got so bad. My dr switched some dosages and it got SO MUCH WORSE. Then I on crisis watch, switch the meds again. Now I just feel like a glob of unfixable garbage.

I feel like other people have noticed her writing ""ME"" in her journals, so that seems kind of like a hint that she was getting back to herself in her writing. 
I saw something a while back that Brandon Urie said that she had the music video all done before the song was even complete. ME! has a sound that is totally different from LWYMMD, which also prefaced a darker album. ME! Is lighter and fun which alot of her songs on this album are: IFTYE, Cruel Summer, The Man, ITHK, Paper Rings, London Boy, YNTCD. even Cornelia Street is fairly upbeat considering the lyrics. 
ME! Definitely had a purpose, and I believe that was for us-for the fun clues and anticipation. And...... Brandon Urie, I mean, yes please!"

I would definitely discuss your concerns with your therapist. That is the healthy way to deal with these feelings. If you leave this therapist without talking about this, it could create a mistrust with a new therapist too. 

To be honest, I get upset with my therapist a lot, but it is because she is trying to push me out of my comfort zone into a healing.

But, I am myself around him. I am glad you got out of that relationship, that would be a horrible feeling.
