Hope my favorite cleaning tip helps :)"

My husband is so balanced, he loves me through the depression. Everyday is a new day and he doesn’t hold my bad days against me. 
I had a hard time letting him in. The first year I would tell him I was busy when I was in my darkest mind set. It was easy to keep him away from it. But when we moved in together I couldn’t shield it from him. I was so concerned with how my depression effected him and I didn’t want to burden him. He told me after a few months when I was in a deep depression that I needed to let him be there for me. He said “I have earned the privilege of being here for you, don’t take that away from me.” I think of that line every time I want to hide my depression from him. The only time he gets frustrated with my depression is when I’m not doing things to help myself get out of it. Such as working out, eating healthy, staying connected with friends and family. He wants me to be happy and knows that I am the only one who can truly make myself feel better, but understands I will always have depression. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is, don’t give up on yourself and people who love you for who you are won’t give up on you!"

depression,ez66tj8,t3_d00sjv,1567709490.0,"All my life I have had the same issue! I started running/stair master 3 months ago and not only did my depression get a little better but I wasn’t hungry after doing cardio! When I first started I walked in the tread mill and would jog when my music got really pumping, then slowed down when it slowed down. It became like a game and really pumped me up. I do the same thing with the stair master, when the base drops just kick it up a few notches! Doing this also made me really thirsty so i drink way more water now, which helps my binges as well! 

Hope this helps! It’s the only thing that has worked for me!"

progresspics,excfk1s,t1_excedpu,1566149562.0,Amazing plan! I was just contemplating how I was going to achieve this! What protein sources do you eat?
progresspics,exc8t2n,t1_exc1tz8,1566145545.0,That’s crazy you say that...I’ve been listening to what my body wants and I found that I have to force myself to eat meat. I’m going to cut out meat this week and use other sources of protein and see what my body has to say. My body Thanks you!
progresspics,exc0ju1,t1_exbqurl,1566141405.0,"I’ve been running/stair stepper for about 30 mins 4x a week. Getting more sleep. No bread/drinking. Meditating to help with stress. But I’m sorry to tell you I do almost only ab and butt exercises 20-30 mins 3x a week, I have an injured shoulder that keeps me from doing much else. On the bright side I truly believe my gut fat is due to stress and lack of sleep though. From what I’ve read you can’t target fat loss from exercise but you can improve areas of your life that target specific fat storage. 

I hope this helps!"
