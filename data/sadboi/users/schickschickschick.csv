But instead of digging his heels in deeper and maintaining that his stance is right and everyone else is wrong, he course corrected and deferred to people more intelligent than him. He changed the messaging, remained consistent, and seems to be trying his hardest to mitigate damages and protect his constituents. That's all we can expect from our leaders. 

I'm not a Ford supporter at all but Doug Ford has my respect and I hate when people have this expectation of politicians needing to get everything perfect the first time around. 

We can criticise Ford for how he has dealt with education cuts, curriculum changes, and even his essential businesses list, and a whole host of other issues that are fucked beyond belief, but he seems to have dealt with the majority of COVID-19 decently.

politics,fmpwmgi,t1_fmpo2hs,1586288677.0,"The part of ""Asians as a whole do very well in the schools, workplace etc."" is so problematic. Asians are viewed as the ""model minority"" which in itself is based on systemic racism and treatment of Asian people. Racism against Asian people is rarely talked about so people forget North America's history of treatment toward Asians and how we even got this point of (a select few) Asians being the model minority. It also generalises an entire group of people without acknowledging that Asia is fucking massive. 

When people say Asians do well in school and work, they really mean Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Indian. They RARELY mean Indonesians, Laotians, or Cambodians, Bengali, etc. 

The usual stereotypes used to describe Asian people (as you have said yourself) are more ""positive"". Like stereotypes that we're hard workers, quiet, polite, obedient, and super smart, genius mathletes. Many Asian people (including myself) are also brought up to never complain about racism and the only way to succeed in Western society was to put your head down and work harder. Obviously there are other stereotypes about Asian people apart from those ones, but the super popular stereotypes are viewed by many as unproblematic even though they are. 

It also completely denigrates Asian people into being props who are used to further discriminate against Black/brown people. There's this whole subsect of society that think and actively say: ""well Asian people are clearly doing great so why aren't Black people capable of that - must be because they're lazy"". The reason some Asian people are doing well are that white people decided to be nicer and more accepting of them after a long history of discriminating against them. Those same people are also still racist and non-inclusive to darker-skinned Asians. 

I hope you know I'm not saying this to you to say that you're racist or anything. I just wanted to offer an alternate perspective from someone who is Asian. Here are a few articles that go deeper into depth on this. I highly recommend reading them.

She and her friends went out to beaches, sat on picnic tables, played volleyball, went out on a boat etc. They have had people coming and going from the house they are ""quarantining"" in.

The thing about social distancing is to act like you already have coronavirus and to shelter in place. The virus lives on surfaces for 2-3 days. The virus has been proven to be asymptomatic in people. Every time you go outside of your house increases the risk of you infecting and getting COVID-19. Every additional person you add to your ""quarantine crew"" increases the risk. Going for groceries is understandable, walking your dog is understandable. Everything else?

A founder at a company I worked at talked about how the company rescued me from working in sweatshops in China. Growing up I got a lot of comments about how my family kills cats and dogs. The list never ends."
relationship_advice,fkywynn,t3_flgl6i,1584657911.0,"*This is a long comment because I wish someone told me this when I was 20:* 

People in positions of power need to stop fucking their subordinates. Find sex elsewhere. Have affairs outside of work. There's a huge power dynamic in favour of the person in power. Consent is built on two people having **EQUAL** power to agree or disagree with something. The relationship you have with a boss may be consensual, but the person in power still has control over the subordinate's current paycheque, future compensation, and career trajectory.

Obviously, it doesn't seem like your current job is a career job. But, there are obvious power dynamics, age gaps, and other factors at play. Maybe this is something that some people can justify as 'okay' because you're a part-timer in school and not in a career job - but it absolutely sets a terrible example for what type of behaviour you should expect from a boss/person of authority/power.

There is a HUGE power dynamic between a subordinate (you) and a person in authority (boss).  

What your boss is doing fuzzies the line of consent and very obviously blurs the line of professionalism. What happens if your boss tries to do something sexually that you're not comfortable with? What happens if you decide to end things but your boss refuses to take no for an answer? What happens if you say no to a sexual act but your boss refuses to take no for an answer? What happens if it becomes apparent that your job, paycheque, and career trajectory are contingent on you performing sexual favours for your boss or for your boss' friends? What happens if references or networking within the industry you want to work in become dependent on you performing sexual favours? 

Also: the gym is closed because of a global pandemic. Why is he placing your health and safety at risk by requesting that you go to the gym to be around him and his friends while they train? 

I definitely don't think it's your fault that this sexual relationship started. You haven't done anything wrong. He's the one soliciting you, he is the owner of this gym, he's your boss, he's nearly double your age and he's in a position of responsibility and power. Frankly speaking, what he is doing is unethical and immoral and it places you in a position of becoming dependent on him. 

You are young and vulnerable and there are people who will take advantage of it. I think age gap relationships and hookups can be great, healthy and loving relationships. The time it doesn't become okay is when the power dynamics of boss and subordinate come into play. 

To be clear, date and fuck whichever colleagues you want. There are no moral or ethical issues in mingling with colleagues of the legal age outside of work. But, the second your boss or anyone with authority within an organisation solicits you for sex/dating/etc, they are crossing a line and what they are doing is wrong. I'm being hard on your boss because people in positions of authority wield a lot of power and responsibility. They need to take that seriously and with consideration for the people they employ. 

If you want to talk more about this, send me a PM."

It infuriates me to see people so plainly disregard the health of society at large - especially when they're people in positions of privilege and power. Their reckless behaviours trickle down to people who are vulnerable and don't have the privilege and power they do to protect themselves. It also sets an example to people who follow them that maybe it's not something that needs to be taken seriously.

I also think there are just a tonne of people who haven’t evolved to see outside of their own limited subjective experience and aren’t open to accepting that other people’s experiences are equally valid. Rotunno happens to be one of those people."

VoteBlue,f5kuv6a,t1_f5j90h0,1572270274.0,"People in positions of power need to stop fucking their subordinates. Find sex elsewhere. Have affairs outside of work. There's a huge power dynamic in favour of the person in power. Even if the relationship is consensual, the person in power still has control over the subordinate's current paycheque, future compensation, and career trajectory. 

There are also allegations of her having an affair with a congressional staffer as well as her having a relationship with her 22 yr old campaign staffer. She admitted to having a consensual relationship with the campaign staffer in her resignation letter but denied the relationship with the congressional staffer.

The House Ethics committee prohibits relationships between members and their employees because a whole slew of male Congress members resigned last year due to sexual harassment allegations. The relationship with the campaign staffer technically doesn't break House rules but is still inappropriate and wrong. 

There's also the revenge porn aspect of this story where Hill is the victim. The assholes leaked her nudes to media outlets (Red State and Daily Mail) which included her nude photos in the reporting. The nudes were allegedly leaked by her husband. Hill and her husband are in the middle of divorce proceedings.

All in all, huge dumpster fire and ESH. She rightfully resigned, her husband is a POS, Daily Mail and Red State suck for disseminating revenge porn."

femalefashionadvice,f0juvbu,t3_d50uqn,1568663580.0,"Many designer brands use better quality materials on their shoes which in theory will last longer. Quality is also dependent on how you use and take care of the shoe and also whether or not the designer put thought into how the materials in the shoes can be put into practical use.

I do think it's important to note that designer shoes are not synonymous with comfort. In my experience, it's very easy to tell that many mainstream designer brands build their shoes off how fashionable, stylish and trendy it is. Often times, the sole of the shoe is flat with close to no treading, and there's minimal support in the footbed/arch/heel. All these items contribute to the level of comfortability in a shoe. 

But on the flip side, the design of the shoe is usually meticulous and very pleasing to the eye. Adding stud embellishments to the straps of a heel doesn't do much for comfort (and depending on some it probably detracts the level of comfort) but to some, it's pretty. 

Also, designer goods are also subjected to a lot of marketing exposure. The more frequently you are exposed to something that is seen as ""popular"" and ""good"", the more likely you will come to feel the same way and eventually want to make a purchase."
