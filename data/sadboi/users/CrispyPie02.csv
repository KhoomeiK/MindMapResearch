Doom,fl1h8uu,t3_flzg6b,1584728954.0,"1.) **Doom Eternal is a very challenging game** . Easily harder than Doom 2016. But it's the kind of hard where you have the tools to excell, but the game really tests you to see if you know how to use them optimally. Threat assessment and prioritizing is key, and you have to go in with a clear and calm mind. You have a gun or a move suited for practically every situation, but it's up to you to know exactly when and where to use the right tools. Also Doom Eternal kind of assumes you've played 2016. The game still has plenty of tutorials and doesn't just drop you in the deep end of the pool, but when it comes to returning mechanics and monsters, the pace is a faster and more brief ""refresher"" of sorts.

2.) I haven't touched multiplayer myself honestly but I can say with utmost confidence that if you're buying this game, it's for the singleplayer content. The doom formula works best in a single player format, so if you're big into *good* multiplayer, then Eternal is not for you. In my opinion the single player content is so enjoyable that multiplayer is just not needed.

3.) Replay value is high. Multiple secrets that can lead to extra unlocks and upgrades to your skills (which are practically essential for late game), multiple difficulty modes to challenge yourself (including permadeath runs), achievements, and a bunch of challenges you can complete for more upgrades and unlocks. Each level has 3 side challenges that you can complete, and have special ""slayer rooms"" that are extremely difficult survival challenges that are sure to keep you busy for a while. The game encourages going back to previous levels with the new weapons and skills you aquire, so that's added replay incentive aswell. There's also an endless sandbox of sorts accessible from the hub world where you can fight endless waves of demons. The customization on offer can also add replayability, since you can try out different suit and weapon upgrades for different approaches to levels.


If you like difficult shooters I reccomend giving Doom Eternal a try. It's relatively bug free, and the game is optimized for pc very well, especially for a newly launched game. The story is sort of pushed to the side, but in terms of a game, it's just incredibly fun and engaging."

Eventually the girl would leave because the constant depressed musings and monologues of the Doomer would eventually be so unbearable and annoying that she breaks things off and goes with another, happier guy. This rejection would then probably leave the Doomer feeling even more alone and isolated than he already was and push him even further towards loneliness and isolation since the narrative in his mind of socializing and opening being pointless and painful would have been proven correct due to the experience.

They have quite a bit of content, and the combat is cartoony and over the top with flashy moves and vivid colors. The general artstyle and writing is kid friendly but still very well done and entertaining.

Psychonauts is also good. It's a pseudo open world 3d platformer with a ton of side quests to do and collectibles to find. The artstyle is very stylized and entertaining, and while the writing has moments of dark humor, they're subtle enough to go over a kid's head. They'd probably be to busy with the action and psychic power stuff to care much about it anyways. No realistic violence here, all cartoony and played for laughs."
patientgamers,ff7ulvr,t3_ermok9,1579658742.0,"I feel like good roguelikes use the randomness to it's advantage. Instead of relying on just muscle memory from replaying the same stage over and over, roguelikes force you to learn and master the individual mechanics and encourages active engagement with these mechanics since they're the only constants you have to work with. This can lead to a stronger sense if achievement since you actually developed skills and tactics to outsmart the game, rather than just relying on souless memorization with no added thought behind it.

The permadeath and high starting difficulty also can add to the sense of achievement. Having so much on the line raises the stakes and makes succeeding feel all the more satisfying since you know you passed the gauntlet thanks to your own skill. This also ties back to the first point and helps reinforce the lessons the game tries to teach you. Each run serves as a test on whether or not you actually understand how the game works. If you fail the test, you don't make any progress. The game in a way is actively telling you how good you are by showing the progress you made from each fresh beginning. Showing progress like this and not by using checkpoints or other set points makes the sense of accomplishment feel earned rather than just handed to you for making it to a specific point in the game.

As for your opinion on why developers choose roguelikes, I think it's extremely insulting and condescending to the devs who care about their craft. Using randomization to make your game more valuable isn't inherently a sign of weakness. That's like saying all developers who choose to make 2d platformers are lazy since they're working with more a restrictive genre and gameplay style. Or saying that all rpg devs are lazy since they can use menu navigation, reading, and story cutscenes as an exscuse to half-ass gameplay. Judging a game's value and quality purely on genre alone is incredibly shortsighted and ignorant. If given to the right developers, any genre can add to the game and make it that much better, including roguelikes."

Borderlands2,fbdpt6g,t3_ec3gmy,1576768545.0,"It's less of a killing weapon and more of a useful tool. You use the slagga to slag a bunch of enemies, then switch to something else and mow em down."
Borderlands2,fbdpl3c,t3_ecpr6j,1576768395.0,It's a great way to relieve stress and escape from the world for a while. The leveling system and randomized weapons also gives an incentive to keep playing and replaying.
Borderlands2,fbdorp2,t3_ecgham,1576767837.0,Mister Torgue is such a pure cinnamon bun. One of the nicest people in all of the borderlands.
Borderlands2,fbdoh9x,t3_ecoael,1576767633.0,"Exploit the infinite vertical melee and don't be afraid to use actual bullets. Haven't played melee in a while but irrc there are some skills that buff shotguns and explosives, so a high-pellet torgue or jakobs shotty could still prove some use.

Also, aim for criticals. Always. You can still score crits with melee hits, and crits always makes killing things faster and more efficient whether it be with a bullet or a buzz axe. Personally speaking, crits > slag. Ideally crits+slag is the best combo, but in uvhm, crits can be more reliable and efficient than just using slag. *always aim for criticals*"
borderlands3,fbdnvk4,t3_ecp8y2,1576767208.0,Ye ye. Krieg would be proud.
