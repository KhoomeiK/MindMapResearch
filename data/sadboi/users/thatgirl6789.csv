I did bio, Chem and maths Alevels because initially I thought I was going to pursue a career in medicine which also meant all the experience I had  up until I finished my Alevels including my job were all health care related so it was really hard structuring my experience and knowledge on engineering in my PS.

Why did I do it, medicine just wasn‚Äôt for me and over the course of my Alevels I grew to hate biology because it reminded me of history due to the amount of content but on the other hand I extremely enjoyed maths and chem. I hated bio so much that I only watched videos during my Alevels, got B tho and so I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing a subject which based on bio as this would me I would drop out of it.
I chose a foundation year because even those some low ranked unis would let me on an engineering course without physics, I just didn‚Äôt think it was fair as most lecturers would assume that people on an engineering course know some physics hence I went for a good uni that happens to offer a foundation yr. 

How did I write my PS, like anyone else. Anyway, since I had a planned gap , I began with applying for jobs in production as that would be the best way to get experience in engineering and money as well . I worked in quality and with that I described part of my experience and what I-had learned in 2 paragraphs , in one of the paragraphs I talk about maths as that was the only thing related to the course. In terms of structure, just look at a tone of PS on TSR but I can also show you a copy if you PM as I can‚Äôt really say much about the structure."

I got close to this one guy because he said he had done an engineering degree and I was due to do an engineering degree so I was interested in why he was doing this temporary agency role. 

He told me after finishing his degree in ME, he couldn't find a job so he went down the adventure + teach English in Asia route. So he went on to teach there, South Korea, China and Thai land.
This year he is 45, he quit his teaching job in South Korea due to ‚Äùstupid‚Äù management and so he had to come back to the UK for good(at least for now). 
He said the money you make there is so little compared to what you would even get in a similar job here in the UK. And he also went on about how it's now impossible for him to establish himself here with no savings let alone a house.
He still blames it on his degree and claims there are no engineering jobs.  But I just think he made a snap decision and later down the road he was unemployable due to have been out of his field for while OR he maybe got too comfortable or gave up.
I want to believe he just didn't try hard enough to find a job in his field coz honesty there have always been engineering jobs up until COVID-19.

So be worry about doing something completely different from your degree especially if you intend on using your degree. This isn't like picking up some tutoring part-time job during your degree but it's after your degree."

I always tell people that unless you have connections in some industries like the likes of music or maybe your parents are loaded, there are some degrees you just have to avoid because it‚Äôs like gambling as you are most likely to be unemployed after. Otherwise you might find yourself just like other graduates working at Starbucks and these are the same graduates you find saying‚Äúuniversity degrees are useless‚Äù, but the problem is, they just took a degree that requires a lot of connections to make it. Tbh a music isn‚Äôt worth the student loan either, I always see people on r/careerchange going back to study after spending their loan on a useless degree.

Before sending in my application, my tutor said that unis don‚Äôt really have time to follow up on the reference no. so in the section of education, let‚Äôs say I did my ILETS on 29/06/2018,  but registered with a different school/uni from around 26/05/2018.

So you email your previous employer and tell them to expect an email from company X."
