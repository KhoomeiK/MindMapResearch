sheffield,fkywr11,t1_fkywj2w,1584657783.0,You really should! I'd definitely want to buy one! :))
Frugal,fkyi2vn,t3_flgu70,1584649166.0,"Okay, that yogurt might not be the tastiest after 8yrs haha but on a serious note there is definitely ""wiggle room"". My Dad is really strict when it comes to expiration dates. He'd quicker throw yogurt that is one day out in the bin whereas I'd eat it even after 3-4 days have passed and it's ALWAYS been fine. I'm still alive. 

Saddens me to think how much food goes to waste when people freak out over food going a day over."
Anxiety,fkyhi10,t3_fl9afm,1584648837.0,Thank you for the positive post. We need more of this during such uncertain times <3
sheffield,fkyfihf,t3_fkydhm,1584647716.0,I love this!! Excellent and very helpful! I wouldn't mind a printout ;D
Anxiety,fkyf7cv,t3_fkq88w,1584647542.0,I do worry for others more than myself... my job enables me to work from home (for the time being... although there might be problems if things get worse and this goes on for months) but I worry about those that can't and still have bills to pay. It makes me anxious thinking how the world will cope with the financial stress because of Covid-19. Worrying times indeed :(
Anxiety,fku63oh,t1_fktouzd,1584543046.0,Excellent! Might as well use the time to be productive and make it fun too :)
litecoin,fkt5r3s,t1_fkekm7v,1584507078.0,Of course! ;)
AskReddit,fkt5204,t3_fkgkdq,1584506484.0,"Watching Youtube, learning javascript & sign language. I actually have to do some work too but..... the leisurely things are taking priority lol"
Anxiety,fkt48tl,t1_fkt1u6l,1584505818.0,"That sounds really sweet!! Glad you are well prepared and able to enjoy some quality time together :)

I'm currently working from home until further notice. Enjoying time with my kitty cat and home comforts. Can't complain really. I'm very anxious about all this corona stuff so am grateful to be staying at home. Have enough supplies to last too :D"
Instagram,fkt38fc,t3_fka1du,1584505001.0,"I'd rather mute as if I unfollow someone they might take offence (I know, I know, why should I care lol). Some of my friends post really mindless stuff daily and I'd just rather not see it and only see the things that interest me."
