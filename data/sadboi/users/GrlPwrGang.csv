I am incredibly proud of how strong I’ve been during this process, as well as how supportive police were during the collection of evidence process etc. Just a shame that the courts don’t agree, I could tell even the lead investigator was gutted when she told me it would not be taken any further. I have to say, this is my first encounter with police and I am pleasantly surprised by how professional and supportive they were - I understand they are just there to collect evidence and present it to the courts. I’m glad I’ve been through it, so that I can advocate to friends to report things & support them should they ever need. It is entirely draining, but utterly empowering."

If you are doing things out of obligation or because you feel like you need to, but won’t enjoy it, then I feel like it’s wasting the time we have on this earth. Sure it comes with downsides, but you know how situations will make you feel and if it’ll benefit you to go/not go. You are making a decision that benefits you and that’s awesome! It’s something I’m trying to do more of as of late too and it’s made me feel really empowered. Ultimately, you’re doing what’s right for you.

survivorsofabuse,fi0pvch,t3_f5spsl,1582042333.0,"Firstly, well done for reaching out! I’m afraid this is likely something that will happen again, intoxicated or not. It often lets people’s self control down a bit, but to hurt another woman whilst under the influence is most certainly not due to the drug. Unless it wasn’t weed and was something else? Either way, it is not excusable even if he is aware that it was inappropriate. You sound quite self-aware, OP. I think you are someone that wants to see the good in people. But know that to be around someone who does such things is risking your own safety. He will say anything you want to hear to make it better. It is NOT okay. Think of how you would feel if someone you loved/cared for made the decision to continue to see someone capable of this. Apply this to yourself. He is not worthy, this is more than a mistake. This is disgusting. And I’m so fucking sorry this happened to you. I want to hug you so much. There are people out there who do no such thing, that is what you should strive for 💖"

mentalhealth,fexxxjd,t3_eqv1qr,1579438121.0,"Firstly, you’re bloody fab for sharing such stuff and I just wanna give you a hug. 

It sounds like a combination of PTSD being triggered, inducing a panic attack. Is there anything that happened prior to this feeling which reminded you of the abuse? For me, if I see a car that looks like the abusers it freaks me out, going to places I know they go to, hearing their name etc. 

I personally also have found comfort in the reporting process of such things. Whilst the people I’ve reported have not been convicted of anything, I have found strength in speaking out and making it a formal process with the police. It was tough and draining, but ultimately empowering. If you feel like that’s a route you could take, consider it. You also have a right to not report it, or may have already. I would definitely go to a dr and relay your experience to them, I know it’s scary but it’s often given me peace of mind to understand what’s going on. Therapy has helped me immensely with the PTSD I suffered from, and just having a professional you can relay it to is awesome. I’m so glad you reached out, and I hope you get the help you need 💖"
