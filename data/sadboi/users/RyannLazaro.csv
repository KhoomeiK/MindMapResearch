Antipsychiatry,fqf0ba5,t3_gidprj,1589316577.0,"I just started a new regimen after being on Latuda for 6 months... I’ve quit and am taking very high quality supplements. Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, holy basil, fish oil, a highly absorbable multi... I’m going to see how this goes! So far so good."
bipolar,fqc72hr,t1_fqbgg6k,1589251480.0,I’ve been there done that... it’s not for me
bipolar,fqc6xeb,t1_fqbhqej,1589251394.0,Thanks for the great info!!
BipolarReddit,fqb47dw,t3_ghjdk9,1589230288.0,"Thanks for posting this. I get you... completely. I really appreciate hope you understand how upsetting it can be for you to think, okay so what if I don’t have bipolar disorder? So what... I’m just a shitty person then? Well fuck. I’ve been here so many times in my head. The excessive sex with strangers, the lying and fear and inability to drive safely... to not drink, to have a filter...I couldn’t, yes I’ll double down here, couldn’t stop at stop lights. I just couldn’t. I was manic. Nothing mattered. I couldn’t stop. At a stop light, stop drinking, stop ruining my life. I’m sorry but that was not me. That was my disorder. Meanwhile I’m in my body screaming out for help, through the duct tape that my bipolar disorder used to tie me up with. Don’t let anyone tell you that that was you."
BipolarReddit,fo4vcbg,t3_g5jr0y,1587511944.0,I love your post! I believe in being a very active participant in one’s care...I am here for a service and will guide the appointment. Thanks for putting this out there.
BipolarReddit,fo0q85b,t1_fo0q24z,1587417752.0,Yes it is. Nearly impossible some days.
BipolarReddit,fnzlgno,t3_g48p2m,1587396329.0,"It’s always a wait and see approach so I’d settle in to that. It’s frustrating, and honestly it almost makes me panic to think about how I have to be medicated to prevent horrible things from happening to me. How fucked up. I’ve now learned to just go with it because I don’t have control other than keeping myself healthy with my diet, exercise, meditation. And face the fact that I’ve gotta take meds."
BipolarReddit,fnxvpfa,t1_fnx5840,1587347348.0,How long had you given it
BipolarReddit,fnwxi8f,t3_g48p2m,1587327391.0,"You’ve gotta get your meds tuned in and that’s going to take time... be patient and keep talking to your psychiatrist. If you hate the way they are making you feel after you’ve given it a good chance then try something else. Don’t give up! I feel you...I struggle some days with wanting to take my meds... but the truth is I’m more stable than I’ve ever been and I need to keep taking them. And if the day comes when I am suffering too much because of them that doesn’t mean stop, that means try something new."
BipolarReddit,fnmx9oy,t1_fnmt5b4,1587079953.0,Huh... interesting
BipolarReddit,fnmslfb,t1_fnmlk0z,1587077364.0,Just calmed my symptoms and made me less crazy... less prone to use drugs and alcohol
BipolarReddit,fnml8fp,t3_g2o5zz,1587073455.0,Latuda and lithium... not together
BipolarReddit,fnb0226,t1_fnazoea,1586806865.0,I wouldn't be afraid to just quit cold turkey regarding withdraw and such...but what about your symptoms? Are you afraid things will go bad?
BipolarReddit,fnayy8j,t1_fnayloy,1586806285.0,That's a low dose. I wouldn't think twice about quitting cold turkey...Did you ask the doc?
BipolarReddit,fnayv24,t1_fnayloy,1586806239.0,6 months.
BipolarReddit,fnayr09,t3_g0hjdt,1586806182.0,You need to go see someone who is interested in helping you figure this out and stop trying to self diagnose. It doesn't have to be this complicated...
BipolarReddit,fnaydzi,t3_g0pra8,1586806002.0,I stopped that dose cold turkey with no issues or side effects.
BipolarReddit,fnawx77,t3_g0nip6,1586805267.0,I take Latuda...no weight gain at all and I'm stable.
BipolarReddit,fnawnb6,t3_g0apd0,1586805129.0,You did the right thing...Why do you feel responsible for taking care of him? Why are you putting yourself through that? I understand we stand by those that we love...this goes further than that into self harm (you harming yourself by putting yourself in the position you are) on your part. Examine that.
BipolarReddit,fnavwxi,t3_g0i03j,1586804755.0,If it's been that bad you definitely should have tried a different medication! I don't care how pleasant your mood may have been at times...stop torturing yourself and try another med.
BipolarReddit,fnavjls,t3_g0lfsw,1586804567.0,"Are you seeking treatment for your issues?

He has the right to leave the relationship at any time, for any reason. You need to respect that. You cannot expect someone to tolerate certain behaviors simply because he's ""all you have."" That's bullshit. 

Get help. Do it now. You will very likely lose custody of your child if you don't."
bipolar,fna8doz,t1_fn7jaa3,1586792940.0,What is this injection?
bipolar,fn7vzyt,t1_fn7tr49,1586728754.0,I can't do it either...no matter how badly I want to. I gotta keep going strong. Thanks for this comment....you're right. I need to think about how badly I hurt my family and how much I fucked up my life before I got medicated.
BipolarReddit,fn4qpk1,t3_fzjztm,1586646919.0,It threw me into a constant mixed state and I was very irritable on it. Did not work for me at all! I'm glad I tried it though.
bipolar,fn40pd2,t3_fz44d2,1586631687.0,"I had a guy that I really really liked break up with me, twice- because he decided that he couldn't be with someone with bipolar disorder. Nothing ""bipolar"" had happened and I was quite stable at this time...he thought his ex wife had bipolar (turns out she didn't) and therefore couldn't be with me. At the time I was dating a lot and want connecting with anyone...just not into anyone...then i met him and was twitterpated. Ugh. Ain't that the way it goes."
bipolar,fmttgx0,t3_fxd5kd,1586378716.0,That's great! What are you taking?
Latuda,fmtt85p,t1_fmqslze,1586378597.0,No. Everything is the same.
Latuda,fmm27p8,t3_fpsw1p,1586197420.0,I've been on 60 mg for three months and haven't gained any weight...and I'm finally myself again.
bipolar,flslefx,t3_fqwpwl,1585444808.0,Wow. What an amazing friend you are!
bipolar,fkic5ma,t1_fki7nqu,1584216545.0,That it is. And you're a human...we go toward old coping methods when shit gets rough. Just work toward creating new habits and be easy on yourself...that's all you can do.
bipolar,fkgmqno,t1_fkfwxxs,1584165054.0,"Don't get down on yourself...it makes everything worse. Have you tried taking time out to meditate? Like...a guided meditation...even ten minutes...could help. When I was diagnosed I had 2 toddlers and an abusive alcoholic husband...this was 11 years ago...and it was definitely hell. Take time out for yourself, don't be a martyr, make sure you are eating healthy and drink enough water. Something that works for me when I start taking myself too seriously and getting upset over messes or laundry piling up or money stress is I'll laugh. Just start laughing...like oh shit, there's something else on my list. Ha! Whatever. Bring it. I got the run around trying to make an online purchase the other day and literally everything that could have gone wrong with it did. I laughed. And then I accepted. Okay..I guess the universe is telling me no right now. I accept. Acceptance helps a ton. And not thinking something ""should"" go this way or that way. When we have all these expectations we set ourselves up for disappointment, frustration. Don't worry about your kids and their diagnosis that may or may not happen. They may never face any of this and it's wasted energy worrying about it. I wish you well!"
bipolar,fkfseva,t3_fhzxh4,1584141426.0,The right medication has been the only thing that's helped me. I get extremely irritable and then act angry and am mean...and then I absolutely hate myself for being such an asshole. My latuda has fixed all of that.
bipolar,fkdgt1l,t3_fho1ig,1584078236.0,I often wonder what happened to me as a child. I have no memory of being a small child...There's gotta be a reason right? I was very traumatized by my dad leaving me when I was 10...that's the earliest trauma I remember. I wonder if something happened when I was littler and I wonder if it's best I don't remember or if it would help to know.
bipolar,fk51ivz,t3_fgfzfa,1583871687.0,I think that the portrayal of her doing her best work off of lithium is a genuine and honest one. Marya Hornbacher is a brilliant writer and does her best work while unmedicated. It's just the truth. Every case of bipolar is different and looks different for every person...and it is true that our manic phases can yield some unexpected positives. That's bipolar life.
bipolar,fk50ffd,t3_fgimaw,1583871101.0,"How do you feel about what they said? ...besides it hurting. I've found that when that has been said to me, I've started to question myself and that led to anger. Anger about all the things. I'm high functioning and have been accused of using my mental illness as an excuse to drink....that one stung the most as I've been sober and much healthier for a while now...so when I attempt to have a glass of wine at dinner then I'm ""manic"" and something has to be ""wrong""....why does something always ""have"" to be wrong? Even when I'm okay and nothing horrible is happening something is ""wrong"" with me. So so so upsetting and frustrating. Sorry I went off on my own little vent there."
Latuda,fjz5bn9,t3_f5xllg,1583711736.0,I breast feed a toddler on it and my pdoc says it's totally fine.
