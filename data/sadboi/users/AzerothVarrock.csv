spirituality,fr5867v,t3_gmnmbc,1589904185.0,"We are human, we will experience these feelings. It is very much normal. 

There are ways to overcome it though! It gets easier.

The thing with this stuff is you're not gonna just become higher version of yourself and NOT feel these negative feelings. It is a part of you that will always be there and that's okay.

Take it as your mind and body trying to tell you what you need cus that's ultimately what it is.

Lonliness is a social thing, these last few decades, lonliness has increased because of superficial interactions with people online and not as much in person.

This is a terrible thing, but you arent alone and will most likely keep experiencing this feeling as does everyone else. 

Try to find what is causing this lonliness: comparing to others and think you dont have the same social circle so it makes you feel lonely? Only talk online so it feels superficial (even though you CAN have real social experiences online)? Are you insecure? Do you not reach out enough to your friends and family? Do you feel you need to hide parts of yourself from others?

These all can contribute to lonliness. 

Self reflect and try your best to keep reaching out and specifically find what could be the cause. 

If that doesnt work, I really recommend therapy as it is a very VERY good tool for this and any mental issues. 

Good luck! You're not alone!"

Before we started officially dating (please note I had attempted my life a few times and didnt know boundaries as i had abusive relationships before this one) he came to my home, had sex with me and would beat me while having sex.

Really I wouldnt eat around 1,500 calories with how active you are. Try to listen to your body (REALLY LISTEN). Drink a ton of water, and eat when you feel shaky, tired (when you're not supposed to be tired), or when your stomache growls.

I would talk to a cardiologist about potential meds and explain your pots and how you never got really treated for it.

Exercise everyday: pilates, floor exercises, walking if you CAN. 

Drink 4 liters of water AT LEAST a day, force it if you have to. 

5g of salt per day.

Medication: I myself havent found a med that works for me as my body has had adverse reaction to every single one given to me so far, I just started taking hawthorn berry supplements about a month ago, and I have seen significant results with those. So if you're in a punch and cant get medication, you could try those? Those DO lower your blood pressure too, so be warned, but it has helped me a ton personally. 

Diet: small, low carb meals throughout the day. 
Large meals, carbs, and certain foods (like lactose I tolerant people, gluten intolerant, etc) can cause your digestive system to work longer, thus bringing blood to your digestive system longer, THUS causing dizziness, lethargy, fatigue, brain fog, etc.  I myself eat lower carb, small meals, gluten free, and avoid greasy foods and avoid dairy. This has helped a lot. 

COMPRESSION SOCKS: took me a long time to get some and really try em out. They help wonderfully with my brain fog and dizziness.

Sometimes we love who we cant have for that specific reason, we cant have them.

There is a reason you guys broke up. I'm sorry you are longing and hurting, but it will be okay."

Should i tell my GP or my gynecology (even tho he told me i shouldn't do surgery)"
POTS,fp7kfiz,t3_gbos7t,1588372297.0,"Meds dont work for me, but I take this supplement called hawthorn twice a day and it has helped me a lot. I am able to run and do yoga now 

I dont wan a suggest this but that's what I use, talk to a doc about it? 

I see his concern because your initial HR is already pretty low so it could give some terrible issues with blood pressure going on meds. 

Do you exercise and work out your heart? 

Like floor exercises and stuff like that? Work up to walking and other stuff?"

I'm on my way too. I'm thinking another year of hard work and I'll be able to work and/or do school 

Good job!"

You've only been doing management skills for, what was it? 8 weeks? That's not a long time at alllll... you can do this! Keep trucking."

dysautonomia,fp0583v,t3_g9zvil,1588202715.0,"I've been doing this for about.... 5 or 6 months, I dont feel much better, but I do know I AM better. 

I can do hobbies I once was unable to do due to brain fog and fatigue. 

I talked to my pots specialist and he told me that if in consistent in management and keep going, I could see results and feel ""relatively normal but still disabled"" in 1 to 2 years. 

Do not give up. Keep going. Be patient. Be kind to yourself. Itll happen, just keep pushing and find balance. 

Food is the trickiest thing for me as well as showering too. 

I eat gluten free and that has helped a ton, I recommend that. Maybe avoid greasy foods and dont eat many carbs. Eat SMALL throughout the day or eat when you know you dont have something going on and you can give yourself that break to digest and feel crummy. 

You can do this!!"
UnsentLetters,fp04rvx,t3_gacamf,1588202474.0,"Yeah haha I think most people on this sub do. 

Its human to crave a connection and closure, so we tend to watch onto things that remind us of things or give us comfort, even if it's not directed at us."
LifeAfterNarcissism,fp04mo0,t3_ga6zd9,1588202397.0,"I question this too. All. The. Time. 

People tell me that if you reflect and question yourself and make choices and efforts to change past behaviors and own up to mistakes, you're most likely NOT a narcissist.

You do not sound like one. You sound like you're still processing the trauma and that comes with a lot of guilt and anger which can make anyone question if they are a good person or have a disorder or not. 

You sound well of mind and not like you have narcissism at all. I wouldnt worry about that, but I understand that thought lingering. 

I recommend talking about your past and events that happened between you and your ex. Even if you sound like a broken record. It helps process things."
POTS,fp044jq,t1_fozoe0w,1588202126.0,What the heck! I might try this
POTS,fowo7fi,t1_fowlzlb,1588123703.0,"Oh yes! Heat is absolutely awful for me, and since I've been diagnosed and made aware of symptoms, i now am HYPER aware and like ""ah yeah that makes sense"". Heat is the absolute worst though. I now take cold showers, like cooler and then ice cold before I get out. It helps me a lot with symptoms and being able to function after a shower. Also ice water constantly haha

If you have questions or want tips (like things to try for management even before testing, although I really recommend backing off of management a week before the test so you can get a diagnosis more accurate, that's what my doc told me to do anyways). 

I am so happy to listen to you and suggest things till you can get tested! Even if it's not pots, it sounds similar and perhaps you would see benefits with the way we pots peeps handle it?"
POTS,foweb1y,t1_fow548n,1588118107.0,"Before I was diagnosed I took adderall too, my resting was around 110 to 130 depending then rose to 160-190 standing. 

I would get tested for pots, but be aware you'll be taken off aderall and itll make your brain fog WORSE (if you do have pots). 

My doc said once I got my pots more managed I may be able to get on my ADD meds again, but just know that's a HUGE struggle and it takes a long time to manage and find balance"
Reduction,fovs73a,t1_fovrz72,1588106610.0,"It was really just my one doc, my gyno.

unpopularopinion,fov66ma,t3_g9kwsa,1588096025.0,"I agree, however, I also full heartedly believe that neurotypical people should get therapy if they feel they need it. A lot of people dont learn how to properly regulate emotions or know how to reflect and need to be taught and guided at a much older age. 

I see your point, but I feel mental health care is needed for everyone, not just mentally ill. 

We really need more people to work in mental health so we can get as many people access to care as possible."

dysautonomia,fov52wy,t3_g9jswo,1588095513.0,"I'd ask a cardiologist or neurologist about this. 

I was always told my depression and anxiety were the cause of my issues fir 7 years, but I KNEW that wasnt true. It felt physical. Trust your gut and express that to docs if you feel that's what's up. 


I have TERRIBLE balance now due to my pots syndrome and I wish I was diagnosed years ago cus I feel I eouldnt be as bad now. My brain fog is my worst symptom and I feel it almost constantly. Very debilitating and no one understands"

unpopularopinion,fov2cvm,t3_g9lufu,1588094254.0,"I fully agree with this. Imitating foods doesnt have the same flavor or impact and will put you off of that food typically. Plus the price and how unhealthy it is. 


Just learning how to cook with spices and veggies and trying new proteins out and new recipes is so fun. I still eat meat from time to time, but I find vegan food and vegetarian food to be far tastier. Just takes time and effort which i know most dont have or the energy."
bigboobproblems,fov1wvw,t1_fov1ana,1588094051.0,"Thanks! I appreciate it! 


Yeah I truly feel in my bones that if I get a reduction, after I recover from surgery, it will make my pots a hell of a lot more manageable. I'll be able to exercise more and more comfortable and be able to BREATHE easier. 

I'll work on loving em, but I need the surgery for my health improvement. Thanks for your words and time!"
bigboobproblems,fov0v6t,t1_fov0cxc,1588093564.0,"Thanks! I'm 26 and still struggle. There was a time I kinda liked my body, but my breasts were size d then. I really would just love to be able to move and sit and lie down without them in the way. Just so frustrated that they're limiting me,yknow? 

But I will work on self acceptance and love. But I am very determined to get a reduction for just my basic physical health. Tired of this haha"

bigboobproblems,fosqx7t,t1_foslh46,1588036206.0,"Yeah, I get that. I know I'll prolly need therapy and help with the mental bits, but I desperately need surgery to assist with my pain and I know itll help with my pots syndrome and breathing (I never had breathing issues till my meds, that I'm now off of, made my boobs grow from a double d to it's now i cup). I just want no more pain and to be able to exercise easier. I really think itd help me feel less of my body dysmorphia too of I got the reduction, although I know that doesnt always help that. But the physical reasons to get it far outweigh cosmetic purposes. I know it would make my quality of life go up exceptionally. Just gotta live with this now till I can figure it out."
