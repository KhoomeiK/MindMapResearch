Jokes aside, I find a lot of programmers tend toward severe depression for some of the exact reasons you stated as well as for the reasons people choose to go into programming at all. You‚Äôre not alone. Even the company that makes elite dangerous and roller coaster tycoon is having to change up a lot of their practices bc they‚Äôre burn out rate from depression and anxiety was really fast and very high. It might be worth checking the opportunity cost of taking time away from studies to join a tabletop gaming group or informal sports team. Also if your at an in person school sometimes building a relationship with one or more professors can be a lifesaver. Ideally they can put the work your doing into context and will often be much more linient when grading your work."

depression,f1k5v17,t1_f1k3cf2,1569532153.0,"I think it‚Äôs two different ways. When all your needs are met you realize the futility of life, but when you‚Äôre struggling for food and shelter you could more easily just not see the forest for the trees. 

When you‚Äôre physically hungry it‚Äôs harder to think life is meaningless bc you‚Äôre so focused on the feeling of hunger same with being too cold or hot. 

Also when you‚Äôre depressed and don‚Äôt have basic resources it‚Äôs hard not to think that there‚Äôs hope in the sense of ‚Äúif I just had these resources maybe I wouldn‚Äôt be depressed.‚Äù 

When all your needs are met and you‚Äôre still depressed I think that adds a whole new layer of guilt, quiet self abuse, and more intentional self destruction. 

That being said it‚Äôs hard to objectively rate depression. Suicide hotlines tend to say its harder to convince a straight A student not to hurt themselves bc they got a C than it is to talk down a person who lost a loved one."
