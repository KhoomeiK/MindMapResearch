Androids can't love, deviants can. We know that Kara is a deviant, so her love to Alice is real. An Android that demonstrates love but isn't a deviant is just following it's code, like sex androids don't really feel attracted to humans, they just simulate that because of their programing. 

The thing is: the game doesn't really say if Alice is a deviant or not. We do know that android children are made to emulate a real kid, therefore they programing must emulate affection, care and dependency. At the end of the game, when Kara finds out that Alice is an android, I think what the game is trying to make you question is that Alice's love to Kara was real, genuine or just her programming."
