Its especially worse in an abusive relationship and you are probably experiencing stockholme syndrome. The loneliness can be incredibly intense, but passes and then you feel the opposite and you will feel happier and happier every day not to be in the relationship. 

Someone explained that so much of yourself is invested the abusive relationship (cuz that's what they do to you) that you think you lose a part of yourself when you leave. But what's really happening is they took so much of you, you don't realize it until they're gone. Plus you spent so much of yourself focused on them you don't know what to do with yourself now. Invest in yourself. 

As your self esteem and sense of self grows back you will develop a rewarding relationship with yourself. That relationship is really what you want. That is really what you are missing. Not them. 

Its like some part of your brain thinks its oxygen and you need the relationship to survive. It passes. It always does.

There are a lot of really nice comments here, but they may not address the gravity of the situation you are in. 

Please please please consider going to the emotional abuse support group and ask people there about it. Many people there have been married to someone with a personality disorder. Those people  have been where you are at only to discover what was really going on years later and have hindsight from real experience that cannot be taught in any other way. They might tell you that you are fine and everything is great, or they might offer deeper questions to help you sort it out better. Many of them have left bad situations and have great marriages now with normal marriage problems too so they know how to tell the difference. 

Let me be clear, if she has a personality disorder, you will want to know now, *before* you have kids. And the marital problems will not go away. 

Also please please please learn from the community there and be very very careful with the idea of marriage counseling. If this is personality disorder you are dealing with, *marriage counseling will not help you.* If you are nervous about that statement please look it up for yourself.

So if you are infected with ten microbes it will replicate ten times faster than if you were infected with only one. 

Also it takes time for your body realize you are infected and fight the infection, so the more infected you the harder it will be for your body to fight it off.

cfs,fo5kii6,t3_g5s8al,1587527895.0,"I also have some freaky thing for 2AM. No matter how tired I am or when I try to go to bed I do not fall asleep until 2. 

Its ridiculously frustrating and makes it seem more like I can't have a normal life. 

It might be like u/CFS-Sucks said, delayed phase sleep disorder. People over there are trying melatonin (I can't take it) and light therapy. 

I bought a light box to try in the mornings, but then the virus hit, and everything went to chaos here so I don't have results for you yet. 

Hope it gets better for you."

You are correct that she should explain to you what you are doing. You can bring it up with her and she how she reacts and then decide if you want to continue with her."

Fibromyalgia,fo1them,t3_g4zuhp,1587441138.0,Yep. I know the feeling. Hopefully you will find something that helps. I find that posting here and talking to people like you helps me feel less alone.
coolguides,fo1sgy2,t1_fo0t1db,1587440456.0,"Sorry if this is a stupid question but: Does wearing a mask for long periods after you are infected with the virus, increase your viral load? It seems you would be breathing in the virus  you are trying to breathe out? 

Meaning you should wear a mask to protect others if you have to but self quarantining would be paramount."
