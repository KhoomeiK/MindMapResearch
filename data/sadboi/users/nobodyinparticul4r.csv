Buy a whole chicken (just a couple of pounds, small enough for a crockpot or whatever you will use to cook it) , if it's cheap in your country / city. Otherwise, skin on drumsticks or thighs is good too. message me if you have questions about ingredients or methods, I spend way too much time on reddit these days so I should respond pretty fast! lol

Day one: Chicken 

mix together: (these things can be expensive to buy all at the same time, but near me (midwest USA) there are stores that sell a small thing of herbs or spices for very cheap. If you're in the midwest, try Kroger - their brand of spices, or Aldi's (limited selection though). 

1 tablespoon sugar

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 tablespoon dried basil

1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon paprika

1 teaspoon salt, or a little more if you prefer

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 tablespoon minced garlic

Cook on low in a crockpot for 8 hours, or high for 4 hours. Needs to be 165 degrees f, it should be falling off the bone. (folks who roast in the oven can chime in with how to do that!)

SAVE EVERYTHING. Eat most of the meat, but save the fat, save the drippings. That is ""free"" flavor. 

=======

Day two: Chicken broth with veggies!

1-2 onions

potatoes

carrots

celery

leftovers from day 1

phase 1: chop 1st onion in fourths. throw in a big soup pot with 2 stalks of celery, 2 carrots, and the leftover bones and drippings from day 1. Bring to a boil with maybe 12 cups of water? whatever covers the veggies, then slowly simmer for 4 -6 hours (you can cut this short. just taste the broth and make sure it's flavored. strain the broth and keep it, discard the veggies. 

&#x200B;

phase 2: finely chop an onion, 1-3 potatoes, 1-3 carrots, and 1-3 stalks of celery, and the meat that you didn't eat yet. Most root vegetables will be delicious here. Put the broth you just strained back in the pot with the veggies and the meat, bring to a boil, and simmer until the potatoes and carrots are soft enough to cut through with the side of a fork. 

&#x200B;

There should be lots of leftovers. They freeze well! Here are some things you can do with the leftovers:

&#x200B;

\-Use as a base for another soup

\-Boil noodles - egg noodles are best. You can just follow the directions on the noodle bag or box and use the broth instead of water. It's so good. But pasta doesn't freeze well in my experience. I learned the hard way when I had a super super low budget and froze a bunch of noodles, and had to suffer through that disgusting texture. I digress.

\-serve with rice

\-serve with tortilla chips & some hot sauce, haven't tried this myself

=================================

other pretty easy ideas:

\-spaghetti with sauce - can usually buy a box of spaghetti and a can of sauce for $2-3 total. 

\-alfredo - fetuccine noodles with alfredo sauce - same deal, if you don't mind prepared sauce. Then you can add on peas (to help form a full protein), broccoli, etc.

\-avocado with egg. crack an egg over an avocado, bake at 450 or so until you reach the right consistency of egg. dunno if avocados are cheap or not where you are. 

\-hummus, veggies, and pita

\-chickpeas added to a salad 

\-I will update if I think of anything else! I worked 50 hours a week for about $1000 a month (before taxes) last year, so I have a decent amount of experience with easy cheap meals."
