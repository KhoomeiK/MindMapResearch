relationship_advice,fdedm1y,t3_ekufeh,1578336717.0,I have gone through the same thing in my relationship but I have been undiagnosed for 4 years. One thing that requires almost no energy but usually means a lot to your BF would be writing him a letter. Doesn't have to be too lengthy but just include how much you appreciate everything he is doing. I have written him a 6 page letter front and back when my fiance took care of me at my rock bottom moment. Hopefully you start feeling better soon too! Best of luck to you
Anxiety,fcxnpzw,t3_ej29di,1578067285.0,"Are you me? Am I you? All I think about is how I want to go do things and be productive but I am stuck at my work. I like making money to do things but part of me wants to quit everything and road trip around the country for as long as I can. I am grateful for what I have but we are not meant to work our lives away because what is the end goal? Make money so you can finally live your life after you retire when you are even more tired and just want to relax at home. I don't like that working your life away is the norm in this society. It's a waste of time and it's wasting my life. Luckily, I have found a man that will support me being a stay at home mom for a while, not for the rest of my life obviously but it's still going to be a nice break when we decide to have kids.

It is a very unfortunate feeling but hang in there, hopefully something comes around so you can actually enjoy the life you are meant to live!"
AskReddit,fahn52p,t3_e8xsz0,1576089314.0,"A few years ago,  I was sleeping at my parents house and every night before bed, I would make sure to bring a water bottle to bed with me. I woke up during the night to grab the bottle to drink some water but it wasn't there. I turned on the light to look for it and it ended up being right next to my nightstand on the floor but upside down and balancing perfectly on the cap. I didn't remember hearing anything falling during the night and I am a majorly light sleeper. I picked up the bottle to put it back on my nightstand but instead I wanted to try recreating the bottle standing up on the cap but it kept falling over. Even with the water being completely still, the bottle cap was too warped to get it to stand up like that again. I had no animals at the time either so it was just pretty odd."
Anxiety,f9s48x5,t3_e6oji2,1575585695.0,Only side effect I had was really bad nausea but my doctor told me to go off of it until I felt better then start taking 1/2 of what I was taking before in order for my body gets used to it. No other complaints so far but I'm only a couple months into it. Best of luck!
Anxiety,f9s21f2,t3_e6nx65,1575584628.0,"I took citalopram for a few months and it took me a while to realize the side effects for me because it was subtle at first. It made me much more out of it and lethargic most days. I wasn't myself. But, I have a friend who takes it and it works for her! Just make sure you monitor yourself and note any changes you notice even if they aren't major. Best of luck! Hope this helps"
Anxiety,f9rl316,t3_e6m75z,1575577826.0,This happens everyday for me. I feel like my lungs aren't big enough for the breath I need to take. Brushing your teeth while slightly panicking about breathing is the worst. Haven't found a solution to it yet
Anxiety,f9hrbob,t1_f9hqcd3,1575320212.0,"There are these hemp cigarettes that are becoming pretty popular. No nicotine, no tobacco, no THC. Just CBD which helps with stress. Smoking anything isn't a healthy, but honestly neither is the anxiety we get. I get major panic attacks and heart palpitations when my anxiety kicks in and sometimes smoking hemp does help a little. Obviously, it doesn't work as well as other things but it can help you blend in with other people who take smoke breaks or want less questions asked when you need to step outside for some air and such. Hope this helps!"

AskReddit,f5r2iw1,t1_f5r1yxc,1572387017.0,So sorry to hear about that! Reading a book usually helps distract me from the heart ache of a breakup and you don't even need power for it either! Or puzzles.... or practicing doing the worm on the kitchen floor

Anxiety,f33v62p,t3_dfl1q4,1570645786.0,"From my experience, I never want to be around anybody when my anxiety acts up because I feel like a burden on people sometimes. My thoughts spiral out of control and I typically don't like getting other people involved with that so it's easier to just avoid contact until I calm down. Try to surprise him with a little something (his favorite snack or a candle) just so he knows you are thinking of him and care. It's not that he isn't thinking of his loved ones, he is probably just trying to take time for himself. I'm sure it's rough but try to be there for him at a distance and maybe let him come to you once he is feeling better. Hope this helps!"

UnsolvedMysteries,esa75g9,t3_c6k5gu,1561753059.0,"I believe they caught the guy a few months ago. He was a veteran that was homeless and living in the Santa Monica mountains. Many people reported being shot at while driving through Malibu Canyon. There were reports of an older man wearing some worn out camouflage and carrying a larger backpack around. A friend of mine actually saw a man matching the description as she was hiking in the Malibu area and she called the authorities. When they arrested this man, I believe he had a shotgun on him. Not 100% sure on all the details, so don't quote me on it, but I was obsessed with this story for a while considering I am local. Don't like murders happening too close to home. Still feel so bad for the victims."
