FortNiteBR,fgpbwqm,t1_fgpaggx,1581001635.0,"Hello,thank you so much for responding but unfortunately no,i think this is a different bug.I managed to figure out a thing or two about this bug.As what i said earlier when i launch fortnite i will choose a gamemode but afterward the game is just going to be stuck on the loading screen,but it kind of worsen to the fact that i can't even launch epic games launcher right noe.The hole epic games service is not available for me.So,i tried to launch fortnite by just clicking on the icon without launching epic games launcher.I did get in the game but however,i have to resign-in which i couldn't.Oh i almost forgot to mention that Epic Games Launcher said that i don't have a wifi connection which is odd,seems i am still able to play other games while streaming and its working perfectly fine.I did managed to find a way in though,it was by using a vpn.But the game was still unplayable due to the fact that i am using a free vpn and i get 40%packetloss from that.My friends is also still stuck with this bugs we were going to grind fortnite but it's not working."
