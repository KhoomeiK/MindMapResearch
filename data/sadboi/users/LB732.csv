newfoundland,fcjzlp3,t3_ehb7q2,1577711791.0,Yes my parent’s are already on the rims but so are the ones I need changed over now.
newfoundland,fcizr5x,t1_fcimnkn,1577673724.0,I realized after I posted that I should have specified that I already have winter tires that I just need changed over. My parents live in Grand Falls and they pay $30 so I figured there must be somewhere at least cheaper than $70 in SJ. (That’s where I am now)
depression,f4ttis4,t3_dlp6ws,1571793527.0,Lately my memory is so bad I can barely carry on a conversation. Like my answer to almost everything is ‘I don’t know’. It’s like my brain is functioning too slow compared to what’s going on around me.
nursing,f41yip8,t3_dj72i4,1571325358.0,It was a paper MAR. I’ve been on the unit for several weeks and this was the first time the night shift gave the 0800 meds
nursing,f41v921,t1_f41rh44,1571324238.0,I started my shift at 730. We research our patients the night before so I knew that one of my patients had 0800 meds. We’re independent with PO meds at this point so I went ahead and got them ready. I did my medication checks like I was supposed to but I thought that it was the 17th but it was the 16th. So basically the night shift had already given them and I gave them again. It was such a stupid mistake.

depression,f0e2ayo,t3_d4exjo,1568562196.0,I’m literally 22 and I already feel like I missed out on the time of my life where I’m supposed to have fun because of depression. I lived in residence for my first 2 years of university and while everyone was having fun and doing shit I was locked in my room by myself. Now I’m going to graduate and work until I die.
