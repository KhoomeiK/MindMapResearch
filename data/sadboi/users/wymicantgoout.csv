Like I have two friends I can vent to about my depression and paranoia and anxiety and they’ll like finish my sentences. I guess I’m at least lucky to have two people in my life who kinda understand my struggles. Most people are too “logical” they don’t think with emotion and lack empathy for others. They try to help by trying to find a solution to your problems, but it just makes it worse cuz you want someone to just listen and understand, which they won’t. Therapy helps yeah, but that’s not what you want to hear constantly. And it’s not like you even know what you wanna hear, you just want someone there who gets it which for most people is near impossible I think. This pandemic shit has got me so depressed that this is the most entertaining thing I’ve done in weeks. Who wants to talk to a complete stranger about depression, or any of my other interest: animals, COD mobil, food, drugs, the ocean, and....wow I don’t have many interests, that’s depressing...oh well."
