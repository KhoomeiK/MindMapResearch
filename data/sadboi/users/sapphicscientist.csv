This has given me a ton of essential experience, more time to study for the GRE, and more time to look into potential advisors.

Also, many people sell their old ones (perfectly good condition) on the UCSD Free and For Sale Facebook page (you might only have to spend $20 vs $50 for a new one). 

As of four years ago, they did not give them to incoming freshmen in Revelle, but this might have changed. I'm not sure about the other colleges. Good luck!"

I would not recommend getting puppies on Craigslist (for many reasons already listed) but I think getting a dog can work out well sometimes! We met the couple in person at a park and were able to ask questions, view the dog's records, and meet the little guy before agreeing to take him home.

TL;DR ask a lot of questions and ask to meet before agreeing to anything, but I believe it can work out well!"

biology,ev8dqwa,t3_cimv2c,1564276555.0,"I was in the same position as you coming out of high school! I went to UCSD, which has many different majors within the biology department, so I can only comment on my experience at a STEM-heavy school like this. I chose molecular biology as an incoming freshman. What I realized was that even though all these majors had different names (general biology, microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, etc), most of them only differed by a few classes, so it was relatively easy to change your major if you wished (I ended up graduating as biochemistry). My older cousin once told me that as a biology major in undergrad, you learn a little bit about a lot of different things, and I still think this is true. Don‚Äôt worry about becoming super ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù at this stage. You will be taking a variety of courses and you will learn what really interests you!

Secondly, a great way to try out different areas of biology is to volunteer in a lab! During my undergrad, I volunteered in both marine biology and ecology labs while taking classes for my major which was a completely different kind of bio. This allowed me to explore my interests and ultimately helped me narrow down what I enjoyed enough to pursue as a career. 

Hope this helped, and good luck in your college search!"

I came from a very small high school (not a lot of resources, only 1 bio class offered), and I was terrified of joining a lab as an undergrad, thinking I would be expected to know a lot going in, so I put it off until the summer before senior year. This is my biggest regret of undergrad! UCSD has some amazing research going on and is home to some incredible mentors and scientists. All you need to do is reach out and show that you are passionate. Contrary to what I thought, you are not expected to know much, if anything, going in. The people there will teach you everything you need to know, and you will learn so many valuable skills for your future career/schooling. I ended up working/volunteering in 3 labs as an undergrad and I now have a full time job as a tech  at a UCSD lab (which I got less than a month after graduating).

I brought my things in a suitcase, which was helpful to have around anyway since I occasionally flew home to visit family. Cardboard boxes are also nice to use (especially if you are driving from your house to campus for move in) because you can recycle them after you unpack and don‚Äôt have to worry about storing them anywhere. I would suggest bringing a couple people to help carry things up. It‚Äôs not completely necessary but very helpful!"

So far, it has been a great way to learn so many relevant techniques that I will surely use as a PhD student. And I've heard it looks good on apps! Might be worth looking into. At least in biology, jobs entitled lab/research assistant/technician/associate are quite abundant (where I am located). Hope this helps! Good luck on the job hunt!"
