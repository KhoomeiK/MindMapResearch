AMA,fr3cki4,t3_gm86y6,1589854498.0,"I have found that there’s a stark difference between on and offline, with the latter being on the whole much more reasonable and less dogmatic. One thing that kind of irks me about the overall vibe I’ve noticed is the sheer amount of low self-esteem, fear, and insecurity which gets expressed in various less than desirable ways. I get it partly, especially if it’s known that your family is shit, or you come from somewhere like Saudi Arabia, but then sometimes I just don’t. 

Many I’ve personally met seem like they’d give their left arm to not be queer. There’s an almost nauseating desperation to seem “normal” and “stealth” 24/7. I also feel like most of the fellow queer people I’ve met would not be the type to attend a Stonewall-like protest. They’re too scared. I hate to say it, but I can’t help feeling like some of it is a bit pathetic at times.

The trans club I was in at my alma mater vehemently rejected collaborating to do joint events, such as a game night, with other, non queer-focused clubs, for fear of being outed to anyone at all outside of the trans-focused safe spaces. One person also said that they’re pissed off that cis people use gender-neutral bathrooms at all, because it could get them outed, and that they can’t have any friends who aren’t queer. Like how is anyone supposed to learn about us if they can never knowingly interact with us? This was 2010s Los Angeles, not 1950s Alabama."

I never took the ACT. I was for some reason bad at the subject tests. On the GRE, the first time, I think I was somewhere in the 150s for each section, and the second time, I got low 160s for each section. My dad tried to help me get accommodations for the SAT, but he got such a huge runaround and we had to keep waiting 4-6 weeks for a response, so we gave up at some point. I took the GRE the first time with no accommodations and with 1.5 time the second time. When I’ve tried to practice for them, I really get stuck with the reading sections and learning all the obscure words that aren’t used outside of the test, as well as comprehending the figurative language and overall gist of the text in the reading passages.

“How many languages do you speak?” I love to tell people who ask this that I had monolingual linguist professors and that “linguist” is not interchangeable with “polyglot”.

“It’s so easy to raise kids bilingual. Kids are like sponges!” In a mostly monolingual community, kids will usually have some attrition, even when both parents speak the minority language at home and being a balanced bilingual is nearly impossible, even when you technically have two native languages. For example, just watch a US-based family try to teach their kid Polish and observe how that kid will probably be mostly replying to their parents in English by age 5. On the flip side of this, it makes me really mad when a parent somehow suggests that raising a kid bilingual will hurt their competence in the majority language.
