I can look back on a lot of that and realise that they were just picking up on vibes they associated with women and gay men, but were really signs of trauma that those groups of people tend to disproportionately show because they are more often victims of trauma themselves. 

I’ll be frank, the more I read about trauma, the more I wonder about it’s effect on sexuality and identity. I think a lot of dysphoria and “shades of grey”, both in terms of sexuality and gender identity, is actually the result of trauma.

It seems you understand that these feelings did not emerge from you - they are not a reflection of who you really are or how you really feel. They are a reaction to traumatic events. Dissociation is a powerful instinct, and it obfuscates us from ourselves. Remember - it’s not you, it’s what happened to you.

No one deserves to be in pain, you included - as long as you don’t try to deny it, bury it or turn it into something it isn’t, you’re winning. You’re healing. Never apologise again for recognising and embracing the painful truth - most people spend their whole lives doing the opposite, including those who took advantage of you and made you like this. 

You can make the choice to not be like them. You can heal, shake off the awful feelings they left you with, and become more than they ever were - the thing they envied and coveted. The thing they made you feel ashamed of being. A loving, happy human being, who brings nothing but love into people’s lives.

It’s like emotional exercise - just like physical exercise, it can feel rough when you’re going through it, but that’s because you’re ironing out emotional muscles that haven’t had their day in a very long time.

Have you considered EMDR therapy? If you find it difficult to talk about your father or his friends, then EMDR is perfect as it doesn’t have much to do with talking out loud. It’s also extremely effective therapy at uncovering repressed feelings or memories, and is very fast acting.

I would argue that it’s worth considering the possibility, based on what you’ve said. You grew up around drug users and emotionally unstable people who could have been abusive toward you or other people. Trauma can hide itself in ways that are difficult to access or express, but the play you describe with dolls and in your diary at such a young age is a red flag.

I would also argue that it’s more likely something happened to you, then there being something inherently wrong with you. “It’s not you, it’s what happened to you.”

But yes, sexual attraction has a lot more to do with a feeling of love, of astonishing beauty, of an intrinsic chemistry and electricity and fire shared between two people, then just chasing the next weird kink or high.

A lot of the real processing and healing happens outside of the session itself - the session is more about shaking things loose inside of you, getting your body into a position where it’s capable of processing the trauma. 

It’s tough, but it’s worth it. And it really does work. I’ve had one serious processing session so far, which was last weekend, and the past week has been pretty bumpy. But healing is healing, and I do feel a difference.

Those that are formed to “survive” traumatic experiences, but get stuck somehow. 

I’ve had a rather terrible fear of intimacy all my life. I became addicted to pornography when I was a teenager very quickly (one that had only moderately improved in my adult life). I’ve consumed every sort of pornography you can possibly think of.

When I have sex I prefer a passive role and like to focus entirely on my partner, to the extent that I have never orgasmed with another person (I am Male).

I suppose I am here to discern for myself what is healthy or unhealthy sexual behaviour, thoughts and feelings. Ultimately this is all part of an exploration that started late last year when I entered trauma therapy.

I guess you can say I am very invested in understanding how sexuality forms and how one relates to it - how it can be distorted or misunderstood, and what constitutes “true” sexuality as opposed to anything that’s maladaptive. 

Could unconscious,  traumatic maladaptions  be “consciously integrated” as an identity? It doesn’t seem out of the question to me that this would happen. In fact, I think it happens very often. The question is, what’s the difference? And once one discerns a difference, how do you “unhack” those maladaptions? Assuming you even want to."

I also find it interesting that bisexuals often describe a difference between “romantic” and “sexual” attraction, which strikes me as nonsense and not an accurate reflection of healthy sexual attraction. 

Bisexuality in women is interesting, mainly because I suspect women have a much harder time relating to their own sexuality in a positive way than men...and there is, in general, less of a stigma associated with bisexuality in women."
HomefortheHacked,fgdjhz0,t1_fgdh711,1580683125.0,"Well, to the extent that I am bisexual...those thoughts and feelings stretch back to my adolescence. I’ve also had feelings that might correlate with gender dysphoria that also stretch that far back. Asexuality is a complete mystery to me.

That being said, women are, quite simply, more attractive to me in every way than men are. Women are capable of elating and destroying me in ways men could only dream of. The touch of a woman feels electrifying and heart warming in ways men can’t offer me. Not all women and not all the time, but I’ve yet to have the same feeling with a man.

I quite like the label heteroflexible, which is a way of saying “I would call myself straight, if not for the occasional weird thought/feeling/compulsion/act”.  I don’t think what I experience is in anyway the equivalent of “straight and gay at the same time”, which is what the word bisexual implies.

It’s a rather more exciting and adult version of the question “is my red the same as your red?”, and I think people should be free to explore the topic out of sheer innocent curiosity.

I can definitely appreciate the frustration, however, in having to constantly defend ones orientation or identity against accusations of it being the result of some underlying trauma, which implies that you’re somehow wrong or incorrect in your perceptions and that it should be corrected. My experience tells me that that’s certainly not true of homosexuality at all. 

However, I have said that I suspect the opposite is true of bisexuality, gender dysphoria and asexuality - if those generalisations are unfair then I’m more than happy to be thrown off a bridge for them. All I have to go on is my own experience, which I suspect is all anyone really has to go on with this topic because no one really knows the true causes of any of this. The best we can do is to try and be as diplomatic (and hopefully as patient and forgiving!) as we all can.

So yes, the distinction between healthy orientation/attraction and compulsive behaviour/intrusive feelings should be better maintained, and certainly understood, in this subreddit, instead of making blind generalisations without any sort of caveat.

This is your unconscious trying to express the inexpressible without you even knowing it. 

There’s something so deeply personal about trauma that it becomes impossible to share or think about directly - I suppose this is a side effect of dissociation. It’s like trying to hold a hot stone in your hand - it’ll burn if held for too long.

But because there is so much trauma underlying most members of the LBGTQ community, it’s difficult to discern. 

I do suspect that bisexuality, asexuality, and gender dysphoria have their roots in trauma.

But to do that, you need to get in touch with how you feel. The answers are there, but you need to do that first."

The conversation surrounding sexuality is an astonishing mess, as everyone is jockeying for position to have their experiences validated and in the spotlight. If I were you, I wouldn’t drive myself paranoid over it. Sexuality is very simple, but the conversation is stupidly complicated.

You were likely just curious and horny thinking about something else. But who knows how you were feeling? I can only guess. Try to get in touch with how you felt, rather than get caught up in your behaviour. See a therapist if possible, if you’re finding it difficult to do on your own. Maybe even talk to you partner if you trust them enough. Perhaps find a trusted third party you can explore your feelings with.

But you’re not a monster. People forgive themselves for far worse and are still human beings. Don’t beat yourself up over something you did when you were young."
adultsurvivors,fcg33u5,t3_eh79a7,1577636045.0,"You’re not a monster. People have done far, far worse and felt nothing over it. The fact that you feel so much guilt over it shows that you’re not a monster.

It doesn’t have to haunt you. Go see a therapist to iron it out. You’re not a monster, you’re a human being.

Behaviour is driven by feelings. Sometimes behaviour is meant to mask how we feel. Behaviour can seem monstrous on its own, but feelings are always humanising. Understand the feelings that drove it, or were hidden by it, and you’ll find yourself again. Don’t lose sight of that essential part of your story.

Good luck, and take care of yourself. It’s going to be ok, you’ve got this. :)"

ResponsibleRecovery,fbvvfcl,t1_fbvva0n,1577136636.0,This is interesting...how did the emotions come out first?
adultsurvivors,fbt76v6,t1_fbt6wqx,1577070150.0,Can you explain more about the distinction between the two and how symptoms differ? And why?
