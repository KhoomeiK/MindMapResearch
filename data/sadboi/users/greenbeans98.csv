AskReddit,fgonvwz,t3_ezewgo,1580977837.0,"So when I was 16 and my brother was 14, we had this Chromebook our family shared as our only source of internet. Now keep in mind that I am much smaller than my brother, and we were also constantly home alone because my parents were working.

I was using it for homework one day, and when I got up to use the restroom, I came back and it was gone. I go to my brother's room and find him using it for that stupid agar.io game (which he would play for HOURS at a time). I was asking him to give it back to me, and he was throwing a FIT. I was pulling the laptop from his hands as he's screaming like a toddler, he clutches it hard, and *SNAP*. 

He freezes and opens the laptop. Screen is fucking CRACKED. 

I usually keep my cool. I had a soda in my hand and was just asking for the laptop back, trying not to stir him up since he will burst in anger over anything. But after dealing with so much abuse, so much bullying by my brothes, so much bullshit in general: **I fucking lost it.**


I started having tunnel vision. I crushed the soda I had in my hand, and said ""YOU FUCKING BROKE IT!"" and splashed it right in his face. He drops the laptop, which was my cue to tackle him to the floor, and start beating his face. I made him cry like a baby. All that anger that built up in me as coming out. All I could do was say ""YOU STUPID FUCKING IDIOT! YOU FUCKING BROKE IT!"" to him as I bear him up.

It had to only be 20 seconds of me punching and slapping him before my dad came home and pulled me off of him, asking what happened. Dad was in shock to see me, his ""level-headed"" child, going ape-shit on my brat brother. I just pointed at the laptop, and was sent to my room. My brother was grounded for a week (which was a long time for him, trust me). 

Laptop was fixed six months later, brother gets back on it, and he breaks it again, but this time it's because he lost a game online and he punched the screen.

I do not regret beating up my brother because he absolutely, 100%, totally deserved it. It was definitely the worst thing I've ever done to someone out of anger, and I will never do it again."
