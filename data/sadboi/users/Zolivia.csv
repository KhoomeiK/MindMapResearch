To OP, like many on this thread have mentioned, don't believe unquestioningly. There's plenty of information available to anyone who truly wants to understand and decide if they want to stay in a religion that would kill you for questioning and leaving it. (See? Even my last sentence was loaded). It doesn't work making  your life decisions based on other people's experiences or beliefs. You have got to decide for yourself what kind of a human being you want to be, and what kind of life you want to live. Life is very short, and it's the only one we have. Don't end up with regrets at the end of your life because you never have yourself the chance to think for yourself, or live for yourself. Good luck to you!"

But first **you** have to decide that you are worth better.
