One more prolonged moment where time suspends indefinitely as I rest my head on your chest.
My hope, is if we add up the one mores it will equal a lifetime
and I never have to get to the part where I have to let you go.
But that’s not real, is it?
There are no more, one mores.
I met you when everything was new and exiting and the possibilities of the world seemed endless.
And they still are, for you, for me, but not for us.
Somewhere between then and now, here and there, I guess we didn’t just grow apart, we grew up.
When something breaks, and the pieces are big enough, you can fix it.
I guess sometimes things don’t break, they shatter, but when you let the light in, shattered glass will glitter.
And in those moments, when the pieces catch the sun, I’ll remember just how beautiful it was. Just how beautiful it will always be, because it was us, and we are magic, forever.”

I’m 20 now and struggled with bulimia and disordered eating from the age of 11 and then had a quite smooth few years between the ages of 16-19, but these last few months have been a bit more challenging. It’s hard, I’ve come to terms that it’s been almost a decade and I might always have this voice in my head and that I might always have this overwhelming urge to suddenly want to purge everything I’ve put in my body, but it’s all about managing that.  Relapse is normal, it doesn’t mean you’ve failed at anything. This might not even be a relapse, it might just be a little blip (I’ve had a lot of random one off purges in the years where I was pretty recovered), but try to find some coping strategies or mechanisms to help you. Bulimia is weird because it is kind of like an addiction in a way, and unless you’ve been through it yourself it’s difficult to understand. The guilt can suddenly creep up on you years after recovery and it feels all a bit crazy. But you’re not alone at all, maybe let your husband or a close friend know this happened even though it did happen once so they can be a bit aware of it and if anything does suddenly escalate, you have a form of support system.
