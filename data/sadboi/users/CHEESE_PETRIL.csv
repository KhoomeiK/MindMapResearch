I bang my head against the desk. Nobody can watch Love Island, or any other TV show for that matter, for the rest of eternity. There is no TV in hell – just this fucking office with these inane people.

“Oh sorry Rob. Am I boring you? Too good for Love Island are we?”

“Yes Lacey, you’re boring the fucking arse off of me. Shut the fuck up”

And of course, Lacey starts crying, and the rest of the women in the office will now treat me like I’m a monster. Which is rich, given that Lacey’s the one who’s here because she killed her three kids.

I try to distract myself from the surrounding nonsense by focusing on my work. The never-ending work, just meaningless spreadsheets for all of eternity. What are these spreadsheets even for? Who do they get sent to? How long have I been working here now?

My thoughts are interrupted by the nasal tones of Sally, the office manager. Who knew a human voice could be so high pitched and monotone at the same time?

“Rob – a word in my office please?”

I slink off to Sally’s office. There are pictures of children on her desk and all over the walls of her office. Not her children – she’d never had any children of her own. Sally had been a town councillor who'd pushed for budget cuts to local emergency services. These were the pictures of the children who had died as a result of insufficient emergency staff.

“I’ve called you in for two reasons. Firstly, your performance at work is not good enough. This office is a well-oiled machine, which requires all the cogs to do their job. There is no I in team, Robert” she said with a shit-eating grin.

“Secondly, I’m getting complaints from the girls in the office that you’re bothering them and being unpleasant. Don’t you think your stay here will be easier if you just play along and act nice to everyone?”

“I don’t actually think it will make any difference. We’ve had this conversation every day since I got here”

“And we’ll have the same meeting tomorrow Robert. Best get back to work – those spreadsheets won’t do themselves”.

Closing the door to Sally’s office, I head back to my desk. My co-workers are back to chatting as normal.

“Did anyone see Love Island last night?”"
WritingPrompts,foko0ou,t3_g7lh9l,1587845671.0,"Everybody has an outlandish dream, many of them dreams manifested in childhood. For some, it’s to be a world famous pop star. For other’s it’s to score the winning goal for Birmingham City in the FA Cup final. My lifelong dream has been world domination. Born into an overcrowded, hostile household in the West Midlands of England, I had had a tough start in life. Unspeakable trauma both at home and school had left me jaded, lonely and angry. Everybody I had ever trusted had let me down. One day my tormentors would pay, as would all the other people who had stood by and ignored the torture I had been put through every miserable day of my life. I, Professor Doom, would make them all pay.

Born into a different family in a different part of the country, I could have been brilliant. With my shit upbringing, the chance to be brilliant was somewhat stunted. And what’s more, constructing elaborate schemes for world domination is expensive. It is for these reasons that I find myself working in the damp armpit of humanity that is the Solihull branch of Argos.

Having to deal with the lowlife before me did nothing to assuage my plans of world domination. But one individual stood out; far too attractive and intelligent to be amongst this sea of pond life. Is that – it is! My nemesis Captain Amazing! A rather self-indulgent alias if you ask me. Also, who the hell’s ever heard of a Brummie superhero? Oh no… he’s coming over!

“Is that….” Captain Amazing grins as he reads my name badge “Barry?”. He struggles to stifle a snide giggle. Bastard.

“How can I help you Sir?” I manage to keep my professional composure.

He grins broadly “Well Barry – I bought this toaster the other day, but it unfortunately doesn’t work. I was wondering if I could get a replacement. And a discount”?

Cheeky bastard.

“Well Sir, I can offer you a replacement or a discount, but not both”.

“Well Barry, I’m a very busy man, and I’ve had to take time out of my day to deal with this faulty toasty that your people sold me. I’d like to speak to my manager”.

He really is an entitled prick.

“I’ll see what I can do Sir”

“Thanks very much, Barry” he said with a smirk. “And while you’re there, see if he can help you with your big world domination plan, Professor”.

Sigh. You win this round, Captain Dicksplash."

I am an asthmatic who also struggles with depression and anxiety, and I am pretty scared shitless about the whole coronavirus situation.

My housemate is a selfish twat, who is going to the crowded shop round the corner pretty much every day to get his daily chocolate/snack fix. The shop has not been adhering to proper social distancing measures, so he can be picking up coronavirus every time he goes. What's more, he doesn't wash his fucking hands when he comes back.

Talking to him about it is unlikely to have any lasting impact. Myself and our third housemate had to self isolate for 2 weeks after selfish twat started displaying symptoms a few weeks ago, and selfish twat didn't adhere to self isolating rules then even when we asked him to.

I would quite like to stay at my mum's for the rest of the lockdown, for my own physical safety and mental wellbeing. Selfish twat is putting me at risk. But, I would be breaking the rules of the lockdown.

Do you think moving household, and staying there for the remainder of the lockdown would be acceptable under health grounds, given that I am at risk of developing complications due to my asthma, and am at increased risk of contracting Covid-19 thanks to my selfish twat housemate?

TL;DR - my selfish twat of a housemate isn't following the rules and is putting me at greater risk. Can I move house for the remainder of the lockdown?"

Congrats France. Had a few decisions go against you there, and still played brilliantly. What a game."
rugbyunion,fig8aqy,t3_f7r8oz,1582397057.0,Plenty of jeering and booing. Stay classy Cardiff
rugbyunion,fig42l4,t3_f7r8oz,1582395923.0,This commentary team is an absolute joke.
rugbyunion,fig2xym,t3_f7r8oz,1582395562.0,"This scoreline is really flattering the Welsh atm.

Can still see Wales knicking this though"
rugbyunion,fig28vv,t3_f7r8oz,1582395414.0,Biggar's such a nob. If Farrell did that this sub would go apeshit.
rugbyunion,fifl6j1,t3_f7r8oz,1582390919.0,Lol. Jiffy's commentary is so one-eyed.
rugbyunion,fia41if,t1_fi9rk7w,1582292419.0,"This is how I feel atm. I've been struggling for some time now, and vent semi regularly about it in these ftf threads.

I also get it where I feel like I'm a fraud, that I'm not really depressed and I'm using it as an excuse. As if because I can go to work and act semi-normal there's nothing wrong with me and I should just get my shit together.

And I certainly get the whole not wanting to bum people out thing too.

The reality though is that this is just the nature of depression. It makes you feel like shit then pins it on you, as if it's your own fault. And it makes you feel like you can't talk to people about it for fear of upsetting them. In reality, a lot of people are understanding and do care.

Sorry for hijacking your comment. I guess I really just wanted to say that a lot of us can empathise with how you're feeling, and you shouldn't ever feel bad about venting on here"

Go watch Psychoville, then watch that again after. I guarantee you'll love it then."
insideno9,fh962o3,t3_f1xxxa,1581373991.0,THAT. WAS. FANTASTIC.

Glad to have the Calcutta Cup back though, so can't complain."
rugbyunion,fgyr5pn,t3_f0r9rl,1581186133.0,Thank God for that
rugbyunion,fgyc9wb,t3_f0r9rl,1581181792.0,What a steal by Curry!

rugbyunion,fgsi6j5,t3_f06p8h,1581084961.0,"Kind of feel like I'm in a hole atm. Been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while now, and my poor job performance has led to this morning being told I'm close to being sacked. Which in turn doesn't do my mental health any favours. It's a vicious cycle.

On a more positive note, I have just started seeing a therapist and have my second session next week. The first one was pretty brutal but also very cathartic, so here's hoping it turns out to be helpful.

As for the rugby - annoyed we're playing Curry at 8 again, but happy with the rest of the team line-up."
rugbyunion,fgopfvf,t1_fgnbu5d,1580980068.0,"Don't know why you've been so heavily down voted - seems like a good natured joke to me.

Not a good performance last weekend for us. Particularly poor compared to our winning performance in the world cup semi final. Or indeed any of Wales' winning world cup semi final performances."
rugbyunion,fgop4i5,t1_fgoobq2,1580979602.0,"Really sorry that happened to you - that's awful :(

Hopefully  you've been back to the baseball and had positive experiences since?"
