depression,fhh7jr0,t1_fhh73i5,1581596601.0,I was in an abusive relationship and I was constantly after affection and not to be made to feel guilty for existing or perusing what I wanted I guess.
depression,fhh6zty,t1_fhh61oa,1581596062.0,"I guess whats holding me back is that since my first episode I've never felt a sense of belonging, fitting in or a place that I'd call home. I use self destructive behaviors (drinking, drugs, forming unhealthy attachments) at breaking point which alienates me from friends and loved ones and it becomes a vicious cycle. 

My thoughts are that if I just go round hurting people I love the easiest way to prevent it is to remove myself completely and hit that delete button but so far I've managed to convince myself otherwise."

AmItheAsshole,fb87djw,t3_ebzksy,1576607753.0,NTA You are being so supportive as his partner but he can't look to you to fix this body image he clearly has. He has an awesome partner complimenting him all the time but he needs to accept himself and be happy in his own skin. That may take therapy or for him to work through that issue but by no means should you feel like you are not doing enough.
depression,fajn36m,t1_fajkyde,1576146344.0,"I relate to this so hard. Up until 2018, I had the best years of my life (I dare to say so far) and since the turn of that year I lost everything that made my life great and worthwhile. Now I just look back and think how it's impossible to get back to that place and I'm just stagnating here hoping for something better. Everyone has their 'squads' and close friends with me just on the periphery orbiting various social circles when I used to be at the epicentre of such a great social clique.

I know I can be great but as I approach 30 I just feel that this is my lot, I can't go back and I have to just settle for this mediocre life that I've found myself in because I care too much about those who are still close to me's feelings if I hit that delete button."

brexit,f6vunuu,t1_f6vsnxv,1573201578.0,It's a good point but the general feel of what I'm getting from this is wait for the potential drop in value so I can at least take a small silver lining from this Brexit shit-show.
