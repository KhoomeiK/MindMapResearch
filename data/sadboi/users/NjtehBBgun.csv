That's what sucks about this.

There is a TL;DR message at the end, but please read the first 4 paragraphs at least, since I won't include those in the TL;DR  


My father's ego is bigger than the sun. He always ALWAYS wakes up at 6 AM. No matter if he slept at 12 AM or he didn't sleep at all. According to him, this way you'll be more appreciated by people.   


***What the actual fuck does a sleep schedule have to do with being appreciated?*** And even if they didn't appreciate me, who fucking cares? I don't want to interact with weirdos who judge me by my sleep schedule.   


And idk maybe sleeping at 3 - 4 AM is bad for your brain's development or whatever, but not waking up at 12. You can wake up as late as you want as long as you don't have anything to do.   


And no, my dad has nothing to do from 6 AM till 3 PM. I accidentally woke up at 6 AM during this quarantine (twice), and all I've seen is him looking through facebook, drinking 2 cups of coffee, watching the news at 0 volume, and for what? Nothing. Just the keep blowing up his oversized ego.  


Oh and he forces us to sleep at 12 AM every night. He tells us ""it relaxes your brain and lets you think positive thoughts for the next day"".   


Guess what? I've made an experiment conducted by me.   


I purposefully slept at 12 AM and woke up the next day at 11. The next moring I woke up in a super bad mood, my sense of balance was out of place, and I did 0 lessons.  


But then, on the very next day, I went to bed at 12, but browsed at memes for like 2 hours, watched a lot of youtube, laughed and laughed, chatted with a few friends, and guess what? I woke up next day at 10:30. Super good mood, relaxed. Got a nosebleed but didn't give a fuck and just walked it off. Had a Zoom meeting at 12:30, it lasted for like 2 hours straight, and it was with a shitty teacher, I was like ""ok whatever, shitty people come and go in your life"".  


If you do something that you enjoy, and has a positive effect on your life, do it. I enjoy looking at memes, and yes, it has had a positive effect on my life. It also helped keep my sanity in check which is something I struggle doing.   


Now not every people enjoy looking at memes (and to that I say boomer), but the internet is a limitless place. Just look at r/aww, you can browse for literally hours and hours and just forget about the troubles this world brings you, and go to sleep in a relaxed mood and wake up in an equally relaxed mood! Why trouble yourself waking up at 6 AM? Why trouble others forcing them to sleep early? There's no point.  


TL;DR: Dad forces us to go to sleep at 12 AM, I don't like it so browse the internet for 2 more hours, I find out that browsing the internet put me in a better mood when I woke up. He is an irrational fuck.  


Ironically, he just came in right now telling me to get to bed, so yeah.
