childfree,ethg07u,t1_etf7l8c,1562814451.0,"I play guitar, so here are a few tips I have:

&#x200B;

\-If you haven't bought a guitar yet, don't buy one that's not from a music store. It's probably not well maintained and won't have great acoustics. On that note, keep extra strings on hand. Strings break when you don't expect them to lol

&#x200B;

\-There are a lot of fundamentals to learn. I've played for seven years, and I still have to go back them a lot. They feel like a pain in the ass, but they're really important and helpful when you get to more advanced stuff. By fundamentals, I specifically mean fretting technique, free & rest stroke, scales, playing in different positions, and other stuff like that. Getting beginner's books will definitely help. 

&#x200B;

\-Practice consistently. Again, it feels like a pain sometimes, but the fundamentals really start to stick if you do. Also, don't practice the same exact things every day. I did that for a while and noticed I wasn't having as much fun or learning as much.

&#x200B;

\-Be open to learning new things. My music professor has often told me there are so many things you can do with the whole neck of the guitar. Don't hold yourself to just the first five frets.

&#x200B;

\-Keep your guitar in a safe place in room temperature. Get a humidifier as well.

&#x200B;

\-Practice with a metronome. Seriously.

&#x200B;

If you have any more questions or want to know more, feel free to PM me! Guitar is a really versatile and fun instrument to learn!"

&#x200B;

Somehow though, I've gotten stuck with rowdy kids around me the last few times I've flown. My family flew to Orlando a few years ago for a wedding, and the kid sitting behind me keep putting the tray table up and slamming it back down. I was already feeling really anxious and tired (it was an early morning flight and I had a late shift at work the night before), and I was on the verge of either snapping or having a panic attack. Luckily, the kid fell asleep 30 mins into the flight. A year later, when my mom and I were flying home from Orlando after a vacation, we landed a little hard and fast. The kids around us screamed. That made my anxiety skyrocket by 100.

So to get back to your question, I'm a survivor and don't have very clear memories of what happened (I was in my teens just to put this in context). I remember being touched, but I couldn't give you a detailed explanation of what happened. My therapist told me unclear memories stem from the ""fight or flight"" response: your body is so hyped on adrenaline trying to figure out what to do that your memory takes a backseat. But because you're so scared/frightened/other strong emotions that come about, you still remember the feelings. Anytime someone hugs me or gets in my personal bubble (I have a pretty big bubble), I'm absolutely terrified, even though I don't have any real reason to feel afraid. 

I also feel disgust. Even if the touch is in a positive context, like a hug from a friend, my mind goes back to when my abuser touched me. I hate the feeling of those hands and just want to shrivel up and roll in a corner. 

All-in-all, the mind works in weird ways. We're wired to remember feelings more, especially negative ones. So, I can understand what you're going through (to an extent, since we process these things differently). But you are not disgusting--you are strong and courageous! \*sends Internet hugs\*"

childfree,erzeoio,t1_erypn2f,1561433503.0,"I have been thinking about the media coverage about abortion a lot lately, and I'm really worried. I don't live in any of the states that passed those bills, but with all the crazy crap going on these days, that could change. In terms of big life changes, two come to mind. One is my definite decision to be childfree. When I first started having these dreams, I was on the fence, but I made up my mind after the abortion news came out. The other is me having an increase of PTSD symptoms and wanting to talk more with my family about how it affects me. I rarely ever talk about it with them.

I also feel more at ease with having a lot of control over my life, so that's a factor too."

I'm sorry you went through all of that. Remember that you are a strong and brave person. The things that people like this woman say are a reflection of THEM, NOT you. Also, you are a survivor. Even if you don't feel like it inside. \*sends Internet hugs\*"

childfree,erswcwp,t3_c3btqg,1561225927.0,"I don't understand...my parents raised my sister and I really well and were still able to watch a lot of games growing up. Not just football, but a lot of college lacrosse too. They made it a learning experience for us, too. When I was six or seven, I got a Redskins book at the library to keep track of their victories/losses, read player bios, etc. Every week, my mom would ask me what I wrote and stuff. At lacrosse games, they'd talk with us about the techniques of different plays, when players broke rules, and good sportsmanship. We also went to Super Bowl parties and even just gatherings of a few friends where kids were welcome and could have fun too. I'm not the biggest sports fan ever, but it was still cool. 

&#x200B;

What is it about having kids that you can't do something like watch a game anymore? Also, it's ironic that people say ""just wait till you have kids, you won't be able to do that anymore"" and are surprised when we say we don't want to have kids."
childfree,ersuxm9,t3_c3fjnr,1561224860.0,"I think there should be, especially for movies PG-13 and up. Even then, it depends on the movie. A few years ago when my friend and I went to see TMNT: Out of the Shadows, there were quite a few young kids there (aged 5-7ish I think), and they were well-behaved. I don't think kids that young should see a movie like Titanic though.

&#x200B;

I didn't see a movie in the theaters until I was five (if I remember correctly). I'm prone to sensory overload, so my parents always had to make sure a movie wasn't 3D and look up info online to see if there were any scenes with a lot of flashing lights, really loud noises, etc. If there were, they told me ahead of time so I'd know to close my eyes or bring earplugs. If they were unsure, we just didn't go. I'm glad they made the decision to wait until I was at an age where I could handle it because I had a lot of meltdowns due to sensory overload when I was little. It would've been hell on a bunch of people if I was in the theater in the middle of all that.

&#x200B;

I'm sick of parents expecting rule-abiding theater-goers to put up with their children's behavior. Parents need to research what's in a movie ahead of time (IMDb is my best friend) and know if their child(ren) will be able to handle it. If they can't, just stay home. I'd LOVE to see a child-free screening of movies!"
