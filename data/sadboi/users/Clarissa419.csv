stepparents,fizx15t,t3_fa6nwc,1582878419.0,"I couldn’t leave until I nearly had a heart attack from anxiety, like EKG stickers on the chest in the emergency room almost had a heart attack. When I told my ex I was going to the hospital with chest pains he went to the gym... and that’s where I found him afterwards... and told him that I love him but I couldn’t go home like that. The implication with that was that I would go to my sister’s for a few days, but he said “I guess that’s it then.” and turned his back on me and thats the last time I saw him. That’s what it took for me to finally call it. And six months later my migraines, psoriasis, G.I. issues, insomnia, and chest pains all went away. There are times where I wish I could go back because I miss our life and I miss the kids so much, but he’s made it clear that I made my choice. That was about 14 months ago, and while I am glad I’m healthy, sometimes I do still wonder what we could have done differently. But then I also realize if we could’ve done better, we would have. I don’t know if that’s helpful or not, but I know I couldn’t imagine leaving until it was really down to the last straw.

Edit- we were together almost 7 years, never married."

ptsd,f2vvd50,t3_decv8h,1570457878.0,"For most of my childhood, teenage, and young adult years I was for some reason (abuse & deaths maybe?) really convinced I wouldn’t live past the age of 24... now I’m almost 40... and the way that I worked myself through it was convincing myself that being open to whatever was around the corner was better than anticipating inevitability. It’s led me to say yes to a lot of life experiences and conversations with strangers and a willingness to be vulnerable with just about anybody, and now my life feels very full and I don’t worry about what the future holds because ***the things I’ve experienced are not things I ever would’ve predicted anyway.*** I’ve done relief work in foreign countries, met famous and powerful people, had a great career, and largely because I didn’t feel attached to the outcome and was instead trying to get past my depression by replacing it with curiosity to poke life with a stick and say “let’s see what this does”. Hope this helps ❤️❤️"

I've been working this year to address C-PTSD (long story, but PTSD triggers are what initiated the road to my big breakup). You're so right.

stepparents,ewqs0j9,t3_co9ksm,1565676524.0,"This screwed us over hard to let the kids read it, as their BM already leans on them too much for emotional support. They’re already know-it-all’s... with the CO they don’t totally understand the legalese but try to wield the contained info to their advantage. For example, they’ll throw around key phrases like trying to call us out for disparaging the other parent if our household shows frustration that BM is late to pickup. 

Ultimately if you choose to share the CO be ready for them to nitpick it and try to take it on as their own tool to get their way."

stepparents,et6691l,t3_ca1c8s,1562504992.0,"That she promised to quit smoking as the family Xmas present to get out of buying gifts- and is still smoking 2 years later

That SDs are pretty sure BM cheated on their dad and cheats on their stepdad

That BM met stepdad on tinder, first date being on a public park bench, met to hook up, and only married once BM knew she was pregnant

That step dads brothers joked about pushing pregnant BM down the stairs to “free their brother” from BM and that since their half sister was born, step dads parents have campaigned for custody of the half sister 

That step dad has become a gun toting religious nut and played into BMs racist fantasies about the glorious history of the confederacy 

Yep. These are all part of what I had to hear about FROM PRETEEN SDs and do my best to not disparage their household 😒"

My SKs were talking about watching Grey's Anatomy with their BM when the oldest was 12 (meaning the youngest SD was 7) because it's what BM watched with HER mom. They all know their mom had the oldest SD when BM was 17, and BM doesn't see any issue with exposing the kids to sexual relationships on TV at that young an age - then gets pissed when they're watching other adult shows on tablets in bed that she didn't approve. SD14 is writing a YA novel that features a rape scene and BM just can't figure out where she gets it..."

I discovered that she does not teach him this from smelling the poor kid and having to repeatedly ask him if he was wearing fresh undies or yesterdays :P and asked him if his mom told him that he needed to do this. he was like, no, she doesn't tell me to :P"
stepparents,erizmmp,t1_eri9u0b,1560911521.0,">Your past relationship sounds like *so much* emotional labor and being a step parent is IMPOSSIBLE with a significant other who does not see your side or point of view. It’s impossible if he doesn’t support your position and a have a *deep*understanding of the step parents perspective.

i REALLY needed to hear this. it really was, and it's in my nature to support. i definitely lose / lost perspective of how it is real work to keep up emotionally.

i hope i get the Tokyo job too, which is so crazy. it came out of nowhere and i'll definitely update here if i get it! in therapy i've been talking about how wild it is when these opportunities come up in life that we never asked for - like being a step mom, or working abroad - so many examples and just goes to show that adversity can either make us harder or softer. i choose to go soft and open and grateful. thank you for the support!"

And what got through to her was when I said ""No matter how mad I get, do I ever call you names? How would that make you feel if I called you mean names?"" ...it might have been a little advanced processing for that age, but it helped her understand what the behavioral expectations were."
stepparents,eqpq033,t1_eqnherf,1560202710.0,"YES THIS. My SD used to have serious screaming kicking episodes, and has run into busy streets in a fit of rage. SO had to tackle her and carry her back to the sidewalk, and pry her hands off of the stop sign. It was nuts. She used to hide from me in stores too until I had to have the whole Target staff looking for her - it was all about attention. What I figured out is that the best way to handle it was to sit quietly near her and just WAIT IT OUT. When she was a bit calmer, I would tell her that when she was ready to talk, I was ready to listen. Almost every time, she was just mad about something happening with another family member and was worried she had ruined the weekend (we had EOW visitation). I remember when I told her, ""I'll be honest. The last hour was pretty messed up. But the rest of the weekend can be just fine."" What she needed was to feel heard, and reassured that she didn't ruin our opinions of her."
stepparents,eqpoqjr,t3_bz35wx,1560202225.0,"ugh I feel you so hard on this. My former SS9 is turning 10 on Friday and SO cut off all contact when we broke up, pretty actively setting me up to fail on keeping any sort of contact going with the kids. I try to just meditate on good thoughts for my buddy. There's nothing else we can do. SO and I haven't spoken since the breakup so there's no bridge to cross. If I called or sent a card it would only ruin SS's birthday. It's just not my life anymore and it fucking sucks. SO let me down as a partner and I had to get out... it was devastating.

I hope your current dude can understand that it's a totally different thing to miss SK's - my SK's weren't perfect, but they're kids and I was more invested than BM. They don't deserve what they've gone through. If it helps, I think of it as two books on a shelf: two different stories, but neither having to do with the other. They both have a right to exist. Hope you find some comfort. xo"
