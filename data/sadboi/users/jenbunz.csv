But guess what? Any other type of pain or disorder gets treated like we should be bowing and kissing the hands of the doctors who are treating us. Psychologist, neurologist, chronos pain specialists, even counseling. We are just another walking breathing thing that they have to ""put up with""

Getting a simple pee test takes 2 weeks to book then another 3 weeks for results.

My province apparently takes clients from every city and province that does not have specialists. Apparently cancer patients have to wait a year for a damn MRI.

I've known so many people whose family or friends would not be treated properly or seen by specialists until they were inoperable cancer stages no matter how many years of complaining. Then dead within 3 month of diagnosis due to doctor's not wanting to waste gov money. Telling them they are fine.

Sorry, rant over."

I am lucky I got into a specialist when I did because the percocet started doing nothing for the pain, and when it's chronic pain, it can be heightened immensely by stress, or just lack of thinking or moving. 

I am worried for my fellow chronic pain sufferers during this time as I know the nagging, knawing pain can drive you crazy and may lead certain people to medicate in other ways. 

I am a sufferer of past addiction and now chronic pain and it is hurting every part of my being to be so isolated with both things hanging beside me."

Also same kind of question regarding chronic pain sufferers, work takes our mind off of pain and gives life substance and reason, is it typical for us to see more flare ups due to less movement, and or more depression that comes with chronic pain. What can we do to not go batshit crazy when the pain is the only thing nagging you and its impossible to concentrate on a book or even tv show."
