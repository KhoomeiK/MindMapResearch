I called the nurse at the docs office and told them what was going on. In the meantime the symptoms were getting worse so they said to call 911. I dialed 911 and crawled to the front door to unlock it as I could no longer walk, 15 minutes had past since I woke up. 

I laid in the living room floor and told the operator to have them hurry. I was semi conscious when emts arrived. They got me into the ambulance and got me to the ER.

They said it was likely a blood clot and they wanted to use clot buster meds but there was a chance that it could kill me. They pushed the meds and then got me on the helicopter to get me to the neuro icu where I was for a couple days.
