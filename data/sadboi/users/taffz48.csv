If it was me about to lose and time was called then I would absolutely take the draw. It's a stupid rule and I think that the turn player should be allowed to finish a combo phase but that's the rules we have and they were followed. He tried getting his opponent to give him a win and unfortunately that's against the current set of rules.
If this happened to me at a local tournament I'd probably just give my opponent the win and be a good sport but nationals is very important to people who spend money and time to get there so I get why it was done that way."

tolkienfans,f54d8ug,t3_dmm8jq,1571978217.0,"I think Shelob is a prime example of descriptions and feelings that a book can evoke in regards to a character that just can't be properly translated into a movie. In terms of her appearance, yes I would say that Shelob is actually a giant spider. But she isn't just a mindless animal as the movie seems to imply. She possesses an evil, sinister intelligence and has her own designs and dark purposes. The film makes no mention of Ungoliant so we don't really get her back story or understand truly how powerful she is. In the books her webs and her lair are both darkness incarnate but in the movie it just appears as simple webbing and it is never truly pitch dark in her lair because obviously in the movie we have to see what's going on. They did a decent job with her appearance but I think they were always going to fall short when it comes to the atmosphere of her lair and the depth of her character."

DBS_CardGame,f549haw,t3_dmqi98,1571974905.0,"Gogeta Fusion Perfected - I'd take out the 7 drop Gogeta, Kami, and double strike champas.. bump Fusion Onslaught to 4, and have the 2 drop Goku/Vegetas at at least 3 each.

Goku Bonds of Friendship - Honestly you might be better going straight Blue with it. I don't see any specific reason why you'd want to have red in there and you could run Gogeta Hero Revived with mono blue.

Broly the Legendary Super Saiyan - I'd run the ISR 8 drop and a couple of the 7 drop Broly the Supreme Berserker. You could even run the Gohan package with Piercing SSJ2 Gohan as that would give you another good finisher on turn 4. I'd consider taking out Hyperspeed Goku or Caway, or even the Unbreakable kid Goku.

Not sure about the other decks as I haven't played them but this is just what I would do if I was running those decks. Cheers!"

But with the info we have now, there just isn't any emotional significance for me behind this confrontation. We had father and son, master and pupil, and now what? She is supposedly a nobody who happens to be extremely strongly attuned with the force and is confronting an old mecha-hitler who she has never met or even heard of (probably). I hope they reveal some huge twist making Rey's ancestry relevant because right now it just doesn't connect us emotionally to this meeting.
