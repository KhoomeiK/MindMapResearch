Many of you know exactly how long you're going to be in a place and when it's time to leave. That is unfair to those who you will leave behind, or just completely ghost because you knowYou'll never see them again. Well I would not begrudge anyone to find companionship while they're waiting for their connecting timeline you forget that you leave behind and the hearts to break. or if you were told to stick it out you'll become resentful to your innocent partner, or you may end up juggling multiple timelines because you weren't open and honest in the first place serves you right. People have the right to be with the ones they love doing what they love for the people they love just because someone did you wrong or you did someone wrong doesn't mean you're a horrible person. You just weren't taught how to deal with these situations and we have to start being real about it. And also if you don't talk about it you won't know if that person really did you wrong or they got snatched or you did and they didn't realize. We ALL are mighty when love and certainty is on the line.

The fact that if anyone is suffering right now, what does that say about all of us? i do not🙅‍♀️want to be independent or alone. i do not want loneliness for any of us. Right now i am going for the source, i am not acceptable in polite society anymore i guess...... i will not have others fall then regret or ditch forgiveness and love. i don’t want to lead, or impress anymore. i just want to love, and change. But fuck being good or Evil, fuck repression, time, standards, fuck hierarchy, fuck the injustice system. Stop threatening people with police and prison and laws that do not promote free will.
