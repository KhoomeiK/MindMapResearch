Your attacks may not look like what you think they look like in your head.

You say you're having problems hitting accels. Try using a messer or a longsword. Riposte your opponent with an overhead, look slightly down and aim so that your sword will land on his head. After the windup is down and the actual swing has begun, rapidly move your mouse all the way down in the last split second. This attack can almost be instant if you land it on their head. 

Also, the more distance you have from your opponent, the easier it will be to read their attacks. Make sure that as soon as your opponent has parried your attack, move backwards. Always move away from your enemy when he is attacking.

You should also look into binds instead of 240 system."
