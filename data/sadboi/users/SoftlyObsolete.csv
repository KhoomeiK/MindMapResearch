socialjustice101,ffygsyz,t3_evkcoq,1580346075.0,"A good example of cultural appropriation early on was the way Chuck Berry and many others‚Äô styles were used by white people to make money from the masses, specifically those who may have liked the style of music, but wouldn‚Äôt buy a black person‚Äôs record, perhaps, using their style (or often just completely ripping off) those black musicians etc. 

A famous example is [Chuck Berry‚Äôs song Sweet Little Sixteen](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UILMUCBecYw) v. [The Beach Boys](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EDb303T-B1w).

There are different interpretations of this specific story, but the gist is that this had happened often to Berry and to others. 

At the time there were basically albums made for blacks and albums made for whites, and those made for the majority made more money. Not to mention that even though Berry wrote the song himself, the credit went to him + a couple white dudes who didn‚Äôt write the song at all. And the money was split between them all, cutting into Berry‚Äôs fair share. 

More or less, the majority took advantage of a minority group of people and their cultural contribution. Berry challenging that was bold and he deserved the recognition and the money for the work he did. As did many others; he set a precedent. 

I‚Äôm not sure this necessarily always applies when people use the term ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù but I understand why they feel the way that they feel. And they‚Äôre not wrong. 

It still happens today, in different ways. I think it would be interesting to explore that more in depth as well.
