depression,fdqrkt1,t3_emnl5m,1578673365.0,I want the news and hear about people just randomly dying and think why them and not me? I think to myself how they have families and children. People who love and care for them and I'm just here wasting space.

depression,fb40y6i,t1_fb3pujp,1576498768.0,You should change counselors if you feel that one isnt as helpful anymore
depression,fb3pkbp,t3_ebc18i,1576482482.0,I know exactly how you feel I'm going through something similar and I'm sorry to hear you're in this situation I try to tell myself that my family still loves me be maybe they just don't understand how to help anymore I personally feel like it's my brain trying to deceive me and not everything I feel is based on reality that's the nature of mental illnesses it sucks not having a support system to rely on is there any way you can reach out to a counselor or therapist that's what I'm trying to do
depression,fb0y3dw,t3_eaqn2p,1576430405.0,Life is hard if you dont have the money to live the way you want I often feel as if I'm only alive to pay bills it's a viscous cycle

depression,fakweky,t3_e9pt45,1576174255.0,I was in your situation not to long ago I lost my job due to my mental illnesses I was behind on my rent I had no S/O no friends my only family was my sister who lives very far away I received an eviction notice and I felt like that was it this is the end I'd planned out everything even pre-timed a text message to go out to a friend so I wouldn't be left there I had to give up my puppies which meant the world to me and that just added to it I had no job no money no where to go no one to even talk to but the night I was going to do it same as you set and ready to go I get a knock at the door from my ex of all people and he didnt leave my side for a week except for work and it took longer then I thought it would to get evicted so I was able to get a new job someone allowed me to live with them rent free to get on my feet I was able to find a roommate online who turned out to be a super cool person and even though I'm still struggling and my life isnt even close to what it used to be I am determined more then ever to do better it's hard but I'm still trying I guess I'm saying i feel your pain i understand what your going through but dont give up just yet I try to take it one thing at a time right now I'm working on my debt so I can get my own place but I'm not putting a time frame on it just paying what i can when i can my insurance kicks in next year and I'm going to start going to the doctor and so on but just taking it slowly has helped me just one small thing at a time sorry so long i just wanted to share my story with you
depression,faksj4q,t3_e9pwzj,1576172422.0,Is there anyone you can talk to? A friend a family member? Even a therapist or a group. I find it takes some of the weight off if I talk through how I'm feeling.

depression,fa1usn4,t3_e7gr3g,1575774549.0,Wow our situations are very similar the difference is I'm the younger sister I she means the world to mean I'm trying not to share my issues with her as she has so much on her plate but even though we don't talk as much just knowing she's in this world with me keeps me going I wish I had words of hope for you all I can say is I feel your pain I am also thinking of trying therapy and taking medication next year when my insurance kicks in I'm trying to stay positive that things will balance out in my favor I hope the same for you
