Persona5,fp5er2o,t1_fp5c899,1588326648.0,"I actually have a pretty good reason for not romancing Futaba imo: gameplay and story demands that you are both a distant romantic partner who only goes out with them every so often, and that you keep your relationship a secret from your friends. Futaba doesnt strike me as the kind of person who could deal with that super well, especially with how reliant she is on Joker as a cure for her social anxiety, which the end of her arc only nominally addresses. If the game lasted like another year of character progression, I think a Joker/Futaba relationship would be great, just when the story of the game takes place isnt the right time

If yall wanna date Futaba, go right ahead. Theres also just legit creepy/bad vibes that come from that potential relationship when you're RPing as Joker that make it a really uncomfortable option for a ton of people."

Persona5,fo0uvsd,t1_fo0q92b,1587420205.0,"That's totally a valid interpretation and I think those would be some really cool stories! However, P5's story focus, ironically, isnt very internally driven and focused more externally on how people react and overcome the unfair circumstances that they're forced into and I personally feel that the confidant stories do a really good job at showing that, even showing that while some people might be comfy with their label, that they're using it incorrectly (like the Tower confidant). Although, I understand that's a quite different perspective that most SMT/Persona games have taken on exploring their characters.

And on the topic of the persona contract scenes, I'm fairly certain that the personas are the purest distillation of the users' personality and the reason why it looks so painful for someone to form the contract is less cuz it's meant to be ""dark"" and more cuz it's supposed to show how *traumatic* it can be to be forced to bare your soul like that in the face of oppression.

Going any darker would've, in my opinion kinda muddled the message when it came to the ultimate statement of P5, which seems to be that people need to think for themselves in order to have a productive society. Darker themes and stories might've shifted the overall tone to feel more like a flat ""society bad"" for most players. That all being said, I truly would've loved to see some deeper character moments. Ren doesnt just sit down and talk with his friends to help work through their problems quite enough for my liking."

Persona5,fo0j6ye,t1_fo0hzxu,1587414099.0,"I dont either, but theres actually something kinda interesting with that (spoilers for people who havent cleared the second palace)

Theres concept art in the thieves den that shows Yusuke and Maderame being depicted as one entity, so I think that there were plans to touch on how the cycle of abuse can turn victims into abusers as well (this is also supported by some dialogue Yusuke has in Okumura's palace right before you fight the brainwashed robots)

However, trying to make it work in the story was probably too complicated and confused the persona/palace concept too much to do elegantly (especially for the *second palace* of the game) so they scrapped it and opted for some Mementos requests to show this instead (the bully who was getting bullied by someone else among other requests) and the story beats that went with that were probably too far developed to just scrap entirely so they kept what ""kinda"" worked and restructured it as a twist party addition.

So not excusing Yusuke, but understanding that Madarame was a huge influence in his life and the way he understood power dynamics does a lot to humanize him in my opinion. And of course, a lot of this is just conjecture, but I think I'm on to something here"
