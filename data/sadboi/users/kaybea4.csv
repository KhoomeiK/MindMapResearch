OutOfTheLoop,f5j5dp4,t3_dnxuzc,1572221524.0,"Answer: There's probably a few reasons for this.

First, the purists. The people who were adamant that this show should not exist. That the existence of a sequel to the source material (I dubbed it Watchmen TNG in my head a few months back as a joke.) would demean the original work.  This was such a concern, even in pre-production, that Lindelof wrote a five page letter to Watchmen Fans in his Instagram explaining why he was willing to work on the project:[https://deadline.com/2018/05/damon-lindelof-watchmen-open-letter-hbo-series-1202396090/](https://deadline.com/2018/05/damon-lindelof-watchmen-open-letter-hbo-series-1202396090/)

Second, the purists exist because this comic is considered one of the greatest, if not the greatest, comics of all time. If memory serves correctly, The Watchmen is the only comic ever to be placed on Time Magazine's greatest novels of all time. The idea of ""don't mess with greatness"" is amplified due to the fact the original story ends on an ambiguous note.  This sequel decided exactly what happened after the original story ended, and made that part of the core plot.

Third, politics. Watchmen was always about politics and fascism.  The original explored how different aspects of fascism can exist and how authoritarianism plays out on multiple sides of an issue. The TV show is exploring the same themes. All of the characters in the original work were incredibly flawed, and this helped show how different problems could manifest. But, there are fans out there that still have a ""favorite character"" or a ""character that was right."" For some young males, that is Rorschach. They identify with his black and white thinking and ideals regarding absolutism with no compromise. Taking their favorite character and identifying it with white nationalists seems to have angered some. Add in that the show is tackling current issues with a resurgence of white nationalism, and you have that same group getting doubly mad. So, they get off their message boards and go brigade the ratings for the show.  (I feel unclean now. I wanted to make sure I was correct with that assumption, so I went to research. Screencap verifying:  [https://imgur.com/a/zw8lsZF](https://imgur.com/a/zw8lsZF) ) Also it appears Vice (I know, I'm sorry) picked up on the Rorschach thing as well:  [https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/24/20926872/watchmen-hbo-backlash-politics-sjw-race](https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/10/24/20926872/watchmen-hbo-backlash-politics-sjw-race)

The first time, I thought it was a weird fluke, and it wasn't a pattern selling well, so I let it go. When the second pattern was taken down last night, that's when I googled and found out the details and that other platforms were having the same issue going back a few months."

During my time there, I worked in a brand new multistory building that served as the call center for our metro area of around 500k people. In 2017, Comcast decided that building that was less than 15 years old wasn't good enough anymore, and built an even bigger fancy building 7 miles north. It seems like they enjoy developing and hoarding real estate."
