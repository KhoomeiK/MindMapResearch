The universe is just that good, and I regularly fall back into it. 
The factions, the weapon system, the plot, the side missions... but most of all the atmosphere. If you like conspiracy theories, lovecraft and secret societies then you’ll love TSW. 
I know it’s completely outdated now in many areas but it will always be my favorite game and I long for a sequel (other than the Secret World Legends revamp)."

I know you probably won’t listen but let me lay out some facts:

- fetishizing a race isn’t cute. It’s racist.
- trying to coerce you into getting breast implants (aka permanently alter your body!!!) and insisting when he knows you don’t like it means he doesn’t care how you feel. You will never, EVER have a meaningful relationship with someone who doesn’t care how you feel.
- that last bit he performed for you? Manipulation. Being in the wrong and asking the other party to apologize in your place is beyond fucked up. 
- you are trying to make excuses like we all did before you. You are not the first nor the last to fall for this kind of shitty behavior, and it is hard to look it right in the eye, and admit he fooled you. I know. But this man doesn’t love you. He is using you, sweetheart. He’s using your body and trying to make you into his perfect love doll. He’s an asshole, self-centered and racist.

The guy that is right for you is out there and he’s coming to you as fast as he can. But to meet him you need to drop that piece of shit. 
You owe it to yourself.
Good luck. You will never regret: none of us ever did. :)"
