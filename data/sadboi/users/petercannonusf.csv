I also read your prior post. Both work as expected and pop up right away in CHIRP. I know these radios have a bit of history with the firmware and I opted to buy the older version of the up-5r even though a newer one was available. Is that what you did? The older UV5R model had an issue where it was possible to set the operating frequencies outside of those allowed by the FCC I think. I think the distributor had to fix this problem. The newer one didn’t have that problem (although there is an issue with it working on the FRS/GMRS freqs). Maybe this is why there is a difference?"

AskReddit,fokfaxq,t1_foj2hy7,1587841004.0,"I think the issue of alliances, a formidable chicken axis of powers, is important. A chicken bite can be dangerous, possibly producing lock-jaw, a serious medical condition (also reducing our ability to issue in-the-field battle commands). But chickens are small and easily distracted by food. An alliance with other fowl such as geese or emus would greatly increase their strategic position (let alone the tactical considerations of chickens riding emus). Also, while geese are aggressive, that may be a disadvantage if we, um I mean humans, employ large lawnmowers or harvesters. I suggest that a bigger threat might be swans because we so often underestimate their strength, foolishly walking up to them to feed them. Combined with the current Covid-19 pandemic, which suspiciously appeared during this chicken-to-human imbalance, the chicken axis of powers, I think, makes us quite vulnerable."
