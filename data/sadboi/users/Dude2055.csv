SuicideWatch,f2tv4nz,t3_de53ht,1570400929.0,Go to your parents involved so your sister can get some help and get a handle on what’s going on with her just don’t let your parents or yourself be self important about it my family confronted me about that once and when you feel like crap hearing how it hurts other people more than yourself just makes it worse and ruins that relationship. I really don’t talk to my family about anything first anymore and when I do it’s just so they won’t bother me
SuicideWatch,euovclw,t3_cgus30,1563947432.0,I feel the same. No one really wants to hear or try to understand why your hurting I’ve tried several times to talk to my family when I’m feeling this way and the only thing they will give me is I don’t understand and that it hurts them when I tell them what’s going on In my head.
SuicideWatch,ethl5xu,t3_cbk8i7,1562818794.0,Honestly if everyone knew they were meant for in life and were able to do it there wouldn’t be as much of this incomplete nonsense as their is today. I was doing fine with being single until I caught feelings now I can’t get it out of the girl out of my head she doesn’t know what she is or needs to do in life and neither do I I think that’s where a lot of this shit comes from people need direction and a goal. People in the end just make you question what you were and everything you wanted just be upfront and honest and don’t change who you are that’s were all the shit comes from! Granted I’m drunk right now but fuck it we are all just directionless fucks that’s why we’re here to begin with do you boboo
SuicideWatch,esduo0v,t1_esb7cys,1561869316.0,Thanks but ya it’s always the worst when I’m with people I don’t if I need to find better people to be around or if it’s just what’s wrong with me you know
