Look, it would be one thing if we were on a sex sub. But were not. I pointed out a flaw in your comedy- and you turned it into this because, god forbid, a girl posts photos of her body on her account? Like maybe to recover from an eating disorder? And to please an existing partner because he has a ""focused"" sexual interest? And oh damn, also to make money? From the people who message her from the subs she actually posts to? 

The world doesnt revolve around you, and your ""shock"" that a woman can be proud and comfortable with her sexuality and body- is frankly a lame point to be making. Its 2020. Women have tits and have other interests and thoughts."
