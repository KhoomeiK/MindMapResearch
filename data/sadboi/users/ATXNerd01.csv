Find a release for that anger, and realize that you now have an opportunity to make a new future with someone new, several someones, or no one at all (if that's your preference).
What happened to you wasn't fair and wasn't your fault. My anger was righteous, but not useful. I came to the realization that I could either keep my anger or I could move towards the peaceful, honest life I wanted for myself and my kids. 

As for coparenting, just keep reminding yourself that the more people that love your children, the better it is for them. Early on, I had brunch with my ex and the new girlfriend and basically (probably literally, knowing me) told her ""Welcome to the Team."" It sounds like this new girlfriend in your own situation wants to be on The Team. Being open-hearted and generous with her is the best thing for your kids, and also for you.

This is such a fresh hurt, and it'll take time to sort out all your thoughts, emotions, and dreams for the future. You dont come across like one of those people who just can't seem to help themselves and keep creating drama with their ex and the ex's new partner.

I think part of this depends on the age of your kid, but if kid has a cell phone, have them text you when they're on their way over. And you meet your kid outside, wave to your coparent and go inside. If your kid is too young to have a phone, just lock your door.

AmItheAsshole,fq701o1,t3_gh7nxj,1589140036.0,"ESH: You're not living in a healthy, happy household right now, and that really sucks. What happened is just an extension of your current family dynamics. You had expectations that were not met, and it makes sense to be disappointed. However, I don't know why in the world you would have expected anything different than what happened. The reason I'm saying ESH is because you could have been upfront about your expectations, and instead you hinted and hoped they'd step up (for the first time ever).

They definitely suck more than you, but you should have spelled out your expectations for all of your kids, and ESPECIALLY for your older daughters on the spectrum. It's not really fair to ask young adults with autism to read your mind and guess what the social expectations are for this situation. Your younger children seem just as clueless, and you're the only one in the household who is in the position to teach them how to behave (your husband sounds useless, tbh). 

You said no one ever does anything for your birthday or Mother's Day - why did you go into this year with a different expectations? They all sound like they expected you to do the work. Maybe that's because you usually step up into that role for milestones or holidays, or because they're just lazy and/or thoughtless. But neither of those explanations arose overnight.

You've been with your husband a long time, and he's shown in the past he doesn't care, and this year he did the same thing. If he's fighting with your kids constantly, then I'm guessing he's not going to lead the charge for thoughtful gift giving and making the day special. I've been married to a guy who sucked at holidays, and I know how shitty that feels. It corroded our marriage, among other acts of thoughtlessness and selfishness. But it wasn't an isolated incident.

My kid suffers from anxiety attacks/meltdowns, and one of the most effective coping mechanisms is crawling under one or two of our weighted blankets with his dog (emotional support dog in training). 

On the other hand, my mom had PTSD and found that it gave her nightmares instead of relief. Just wanted to mention that too, since some people have trauma around the sensation of being weighted down.

The world is filled with germs, and pretty much all new parents worry about it. The good news is that COVID is actually a lot less dangerous for your baby than most things. Like I'd be way more worried about my newborn getting RSV right now, for example. My point is that in non-pandemic times, we have to accept a certain amount of risk that our kids will catch something from their siblings or family members. Has your new kiddo been vaccinated for the usual things yet, at least their first round of shots? Are you breastfeeding? Are your step-kids vaccinated for all the regular childhood things? If these are all yeses, then I don't see why the kids can't all be together. There's no telling how long this pandemic will last, and keeping everybody separate is not the same thing as keeping everybody safe. Your stepkids feeling safe and loved by both parents during this scary time is a high priority too.

The fact that she's flaking out on opportunities to see the kids is a big deal. So many big red flags that she isn't up to the additional responsibility. I feel like that qualifies as ""a reason why she can't have 50/50 custody"" even though she says there's not. I hope that you're keeping track of all of these no-shows and flake outs because it's likely that you'll need to go back to court because her condition deteriorates. 

It sounds like you've tried to facilitate doing exactly what is reasonable and what everyone would suggest-- she comes over for a short period of time, there's an activity to focus on, it's under your roof - and she couldn't even manage something as simple as that. This sucks, but I would continue to try to facilitate something like that once a week. There's a possibility that she \*might\* get better at parenting because of that, which would actually be the best outcome for the kids. 

Clearly, she's got some issues with executive functioning along with her health issues and personality disorder (snooped on your post history and confirmed my suspicion - figured it was either that, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder). NPD completely tracks with her refusing to acknowledge how her own behavior and choices have led to the current situation. For what it's worth - it is 100% possible to be in therapy right now if that's what your agreement was. Many health insurance companies have even dropped copays for online therapy sessions. In my own family life, the therapists and the psychiatrists that we work with were among the first to transition to video calls.

Let me tell you the phrase that kept running through my mind when I was contemplating my divorce- ""I can't stand another 30 years of this."" 

If you pay attention to what your husband does (ignoring what he says about loving you and trying to make your marriage work) - does he prioritize the things you think are important, just for your sake? Does he show with his actions and his time that you and your career, hobbies, feelings, free time/vacation time, goals, and dreams are equally as important as his? Or does he keep showing you that his career, financial priorities, free time to pursue his goals and friendships are more important than yours? Are his wants more important than your needs?

relationships,fpd58az,t3_gcmi8h,1588520096.0,"I think you need to deploy some meta-game strategies here to get the changes you want. I've got a high E.Q. and have become skilled at dealing with this kind of toxic B.S. and truly crazy people, psychotic people, and just regular narcissists. Your feelings here are totally valid, and you brother truly sucks. I'm giving you a strategy to navigate this toxic situation, not telling you that you're wrong. You've phrased the problem as a brother-problem, but I think the actual problem is the entire family dynamic. 

Step 1: Obtain/firm up allies. You need your mom to get on your team. Start by asking your mom if she's heard the rhetoric that your brother is espousing, and ask her how she feels about those comments he makes. Put away your own thoughts and feelings, temporarily, but 100%. You're going on a fact-finding mission, and are going to emphathize fully with whatever she says. Start with *truly* trying to get her to tell you how she feels about it. Ask gentle questions if she's having a hard time, but get her to open up. Show that you care about what she says on the topic, and get to the point where you understand where she's coming from (even/especially if you disagree). No arguing, just ""I can see where you're coming from. I'm hearing you. I'm glad you're telling me this. Etc."" Afirm, don't agree. 

The goal of Step 1 is to get her in empathy-mode, to show you which emotional buttons you can push, and then set up for step 2: Emotional Cannon-fire.

Step 2: If you're a hardened cynic, this step is all for show and strategy. If you're still tender-hearted, then emote as usual, but keep it within the following guidelines. 
A) Do NOT start with this step, likely to fail to achieve your goals in this situation. 
B) Share how you're feeling, using I statements and not attacking your brother (it's a tactic, not me saying that you shouldn't have those thoughts). 

It's really hard to argue with ""I feel"" and ""I'm afraid of"" statements. Stay in that lane. You don't want to start a conversation about the reality of the situation, you're likely to just start off a round of gaslighting. The leverage you have with your mom is your presence in her life. If she wants you to stay in her life (holidays, visiting, calls, etc.) then her only option is to step up and be an ally for you in the house. You don't have to/want to say that explicitly.

An example of a emotional cannon-fire speech based on what you've written: ""I feel like the black sheep in our family. I feel unwanted because I have a different ethnicity than the rest of the family. I feel like no one ever stands up for me when someone is saying something bad about Mexicans or Latinos. I feel like running away and never coming back. I feel like this isn't my home. I feel like the butt of jokes, and that my hurt feelings don't matter. I feel like hurting my feelings is sometimes the entire point of the jokes. I feel like my schooling and career are mocked, rather than encouraged. I feel very alone in our family, and that I'm not a part of our family. I'm afraid that once I leave to pursue my career, that I wont be welcomed back for holidays. I'm afraid that I won't even want to come back for holidays."" 

If the above speech doesn't make her cry with the implied threat of losing you forever, then you need to accept that you need to leave ASAP,  and burn all the bridges you need to burn to get away. Your mom may not have the emotional fortitude or leverage in the household to stand up for you. Sad, but you gotta put on your own oxygen mask. Been here myself. Her refusal to make the verbal abuse stop is NOT okay. Start saving $ for the inevitable therapy needed. 

Step 3: If 2 is successful, you could try the same approach with your stepdad. I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that he's low-key racist, and believes the same stuff as his shitty kid. Him allowing the verbal abuse in his house is NOT okay. 

Step 4: Ask for help from allies. Define what it is you actually want here, and solicit their input. Help moving out? Parents telling your brother to stop, each time that he starts? Support in standing up for yourself? If it's their approach, they're more likely to support you when you follow through. If their approach is you apologizing and appeasing, then you need to GTFO. Their support stops as soon as they're required to do anything difficult. 

I'm exhausted writing all of this. I'd bet $100 that your mom is abused in other ways than this. She might help you get out, but she won't stand up to the men in the house. 

TLDR: Leave, cause this is toxic as hell, and the whole family is in on it."

That's really unfortunate that you've been through that, and it means that you're going to have to go the extra mile to provide a safe, drug-free, peaceful home to your boys. You could try and get a lawyer now and go to court, but if your ex can prove that your home is unsafe, and that you have an active drug problem, then I don't think that the judge will look favorably onto the whole ""ex won't let me see the kids"" issue. You absolutely must get clean and get a safe living environment. Honestly, you don't have a lot of time - your kids are old enough that they're truly watching what you do and what you say. They may not remember much from when they were little and their dad was gone - All they know is what's happening right now.

BipolarReddit,fp40nnz,t1_fp39ppc,1588289377.0,"I think of it as having to brute force myself into a routine and healthy behaviors. 

In a more lucid moment, I made a list of dos and don'ts. I wrote them on a giant whiteboard and kept it where I'd see it constantly. I gave myself rules - no dating apps, no craft stores, don't use people, don't use drugs, don't wait until you feel like going to sleep to go to bed (hint: cause you're never going to want to), no dieting, limit exercise to 1 hour, limit screen time. I also listed things I should do when I feel bad, starting with whatever feels the easiest or most manageable: take a shower, put on clean clothes, brush my teeth, walk the dog, sit in the sunshine for 15 minutes, clean a closet, scrub something, practice an instrument, do a meditation or mindfulness exercise, make a gratitude list. It can be impossible for me to think of what to do in that moment where I feel terrible or completely out of control. Having a list made by me for me really helps. 

I found that being alone is bad, but being with people who are out-of-control is worse. Finding a babysitter for youself is helpful, but we can often be annoying and needy when manic, so don't wear out your welcome. If you have a healthy sexual outlet, that can help get out some of that energy and help you sleep better. It has to be someone who respects your boundaries and will practice safe sex, no matter what you say to the contrary. No new sex partners though - we have little ability to make smart choices re: sex when hypomanic/manic.

I bet there's a crisis line for your area. You ought to call it and find out what resources are available to you before to have full insurance. Lots of support groups and NAMI groups are online, and you can find a lot of connection and solid advice there.

coparenting,fp0me7j,t3_gada1n,1588212200.0,"My kids are not autistic, but not neurotypical either. My BFF's oldest has autism and is also my older kid's BFF too. Transitions are HARD on sensitive kids. And there's only so much you can do to mitigate it. I can understand your coparent's frustration regarding those problematic behaviors popping up after getting back from your house. I used to blame my ex, too for the kids coming back with upset stomachs, high anxiety, weird rashes, etc. But a lot of that is just kids being kids, including kids on the spectrum. Kids get bumps, bruises, weird habits and strange hangups, no matter how much you try to control every variable. I gotta say that I didn't fully realize it until I had my second kid. Sounds like your ex isn't there yet.

I would try to be patient and forgiving with your ex, and gently remind them that transitions are harder for kids on the spectrum, but transitions are part of life. If you look at the situation from a certain angle, you see that it's also you ex having big problems with the transitions, not just your child. You probably already know this, but preventing all of your kid's stressful triggers prevents them from learning coping skills. And we can't take every one of our kid's issues or tantrums as some sort of personal attack."
coparenting,foyxik2,t3_ga5fxd,1588181019.0,"That amount of child support is absolutely unacceptable. BEYOND unacceptable for 3 kids. The amount of child support he pays is entirely a separate matter from your relationship with him or how frequently he sees the children. Do NOT go easy on him because you feel guilty or sorry for him. Poverty is one of the most stressful things that you may face as a consequence of this breakup. As for child support, he owes that money to his children, not to you. It's generally around 30% of his income for 3 kids. For reference, depending on how much money you each make, you will probably end up spending 50% or more of your own income on the children. Just daycare for 3 is probably going to more than wipe out how much child support your receive. Being a single parent is financially one of the most difficult things I've ever been through, and I get a generous amount of support. Kids are so expensive - make a spreadsheet, seriously. You may need it for court.  Depending on your country - get the healthcare for the kids squared away too. Where I am, the noncustodial parent is usually responsible for healthcare expenses. This too is a major expense of having children, so don't let this issue go either in the name of keeping the peace. Again - poverty sucks. The last thing your kids need is no dad AND dealing with the challenges of growing up really poor. 

As for him as a parent, set your expectations at zero. He is clearly in some sort of personal crisis or he would have at least called his kid for his birthday. I've been in pretty much the same situation - my ex bought an expensive ""toy"" for himself that week, and bought his kid nothing for his 3rd birthday. He did basically the same thing for my other child that year. I don't know that I've ever cried harder than those birthdays, and I felt so alone. Go ahead and assume that you're not going to see him again. It sucks, but don't set your expectations based on what a good parent would do. He is not a good parent right now. Maybe he'll get it together in a few years and go to therapy and work out his issues, but right now, he's not capable of being a good parent. I'd advise you to just accept that as a fact, and let the anger go. Being angry won't help you, won't help your kids, and won't help the situation.

There are free legal resources in many places. You don't necessarily need to spend a lot of money to get this done. Start with your county or city and look for free services. You're not the first mom with no resources to be in this position. Worst case, borrow money from a family member or friend so that you have the resources to get your custody schedule and child support set in stone, giving yourself the rights that you want in terms of making unilateral decisions for the kids. BTW, if he doesn't even show up for court, that's actually good for your case. 

As for the breakup, don't put too much stock in what he said as a reason for breaking up. Having three kids is hard - I'm sure it put a damper on his social life and he resented it. Based on the ages of your kids, you guys got together when you were really young and you've been in that ""parenting babies and toddlers"" phase for years at this point. That's tough on everyone. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and you'll get through this. 

That was a long response, but as someone in your shoes, I feel for you. I wish someone had told me all this stuff - I didn't even know where to start, and I wanted to keep being ""the good guy."" Keep your eye on what you need in the long run - enough child support to not be broke for the next 18 years, and the rights to determine where your kids go to school, make medical decisions, etc. Do whatever you have to do to fight your way to that future for you all. Good luck."
datingoverthirty,foviq54,t1_fov739z,1588101997.0,"I think that this is the best response to your question. OP, you're showing some red flags in a few ways here. Let's assume that I'm the woman you're dating...

1 - You falling and developing intense feelings, high hopes, etc. in such a short amount of time indicates that you're falling before you even truly know who I am. To me, that means that you're falling for your ideal of me, rather than the actual person I am, and you're just trying to slot me into the woman-shaped hole in your life. Someone who feels super-strongly about me in a very short amount of time is an indicator of bad judgment. You barely know me! ""Not ready for a serious relationship"" could mean ""Not ready to have the level of intensity you're bringing to this relationship.""

2 - You come across as someone who has a lot of time to text and wants to text frequently, and you take offense when someone is busy and isn't into texting as much as you are. This may take you out of the running with a large proportion of women. For someone like me, I find that amount of texting to be very high-maintenance and usually really boring. My work is high-maintenance, my family, my house, my dogs, etc. I've got a lot of high-maintenance parts of my life, and dating is supposed to be fun, not work. I'd rather look forward to our time together, talk about our week, and genuinely connect. ""Don't have time for a relationship"" could mean ""I don't have time to meet all your emotional needs because I'm busy with other important parts of my life.""

I'm not saying OP should date me or my clone, but from someone in the general age bracket and dating more or less successfully, the above issues would have me ghosting after a few dates, too."
coparenting,fosocqm,t3_g8uiwn,1588034706.0,"Hi from another single mom with bipolar. It sounds like you and your ex need formal boundaries first - a legal parenting plan/custody schedule, official child support. To be the best version of yourself for your kid, you gotta stay on top of your meds and your health. If you're in a depressed swing, call your doc and tell them what's up. Being newly diagnosed is hard, and one thing you've got to learn how to do is to advocate for youself with your medical team. Med adjustments are totally normal for us, and it's not a failure to need to ask for a change to address a new issue or symptom that's come up. 

First of all, you have GOT to stop hooking up with your kid's dad. You can't have a FWB who cheats and lies about sex. Period. Find a new FWB with has communication skills and no history of lying to you or guilt tripping you. There's no penis shortage in the world, btw. 

And you've also got to find a way to transition into being coparents instead of exes. You can shoot the shit with your ex on a friendly level, but you can't be best friends right now. You are exactly the wrong people to help eachother heal from your breakup. You both need to adjust to the new normal of being parents, not partners. It's probably really hard to imagine your future right now as everything's changing, but it's better to have no boyfriend than one you can't trust. Your kid can absolutely be healthy and happy without parents who live together. Whatever faults your coparent has as a parent, those things arent fixable by you staying together. Good luck. You've already made a bunch of positive changes."
coparenting,fos3moz,t3_g97926,1588023369.0,"There's not much you can do about this low-key bad parenting. I think you're only hurting yourself by declaring this incident as unforgivable. Because you're going to have to let this one go, unfortunately. If he's already comfortable lying to your face and asking your kid to lie, then your indignation about the whole thing isn't going to be a deterrent at all. You could just keep this one under your hat, make a note of it, but not let your ex know that you know.

If you just HAVE to say something about it, I think the best way to address the behavior is something along the lines of, ""So what's the deal with the trip to Wal-Mart?"" There might be a somewhat reasonable (to him) explanation for why they had to go in, and at least you'll find out what that justification is. I'm guessing that your ex couldn't figure out how to spend time with the kids, and a new toy is an easy way to get the kids focused on something. I think you did the right thing with your kid by reinforcing that truth-telling is always okay. And keep your reputation for being a truth-teller intact, which it seems like you value highly.

There's no way to get what you want here - your ex lies. And best-case scenario, he admits he was wrong and he says that he won't do it again or whatever, but again - he lies. In the best-case scenario, you still lose."

When we ""read between the lines""  of someone else's history or character, we can often fill in those gaps with the most flattering or positive assumptions. The real truth of someone is always more complicated than our imagined version. I'm guilty of doing this myself, and I'll ""wake up"" and find myself mid-relationship with a real, flawed person, and not the version I had created in my head. You've got to let the facts and reality of that person's behavior outweigh the pretend version. Sometimes that means breaking up, letting go, or accepting the complicated truth of the people we love.

I don't meet many folks who want to be in the bipolar club, though. Mania is just so much harder to understand than depression, so I try not to be hard on folks that don't quite get it. Even my bipolar 2 friends don't totally get it. I am laughing at your naive roommate saying""I woke up excited, like I was on drugs."" I would have rolled my eyes so hard and responded with ""sure, and then I did some actual drugs, had sex with a stranger, started a business, painted an oil painting about the dual nature of spirituality, and then tried to be a social media influencer.""

Just writing that sentence gives me a little thrill, honestly. Let's go to Cabo on a post-quarantine girls trip!

Seriously though, I do see a lot of miserable people who are undiagnosed or underdiagnosed with depression and anxiety. I've known quite a few people who are struggling with very high baseline anxiety, some to the point that I've gently suggested that they might have Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I'm lucky to be in a position to offer useful resources, and to offer a pro-medication viewpoint for anxiety treatment. A lot of people don't know how to advocate for themselves with their PCP or how to go about finding a pdoc. I've spoken to people struggling with substance abuse, often self-medicating for something mental health related (goodness knows I've been there). You can set healthy boundaries and decide not to talk about bipolar, but for the most part, with people in my daily life, I think it's better to share the magnitude of what we go through."

My lawyer's advice was that you can't make a parenting plan / custody agreement that covers everything - it's why your best option is to preserve a good working relationship with your coparent. There are even professionals who specialize in helping coparents negotiate their parenting plan. That's the route I recommend; have a professional proof it, make sure you've addressed everything, and help you to file it properly according to the laws in your area."

Ingrain those habits of taking meds on a schedule, practicing grooming, dishes and laundry, clean your closet. Go see the dentist, find a support group, etc. Make a plan for what you're going to do when you feel youself sliding into mania or depression. I think of all of those things as providing ballast for your ship. Some days you'll be in calm waters, and it won't matter if you've done those things or not.

InteriorDesign,fnsgefg,t3_g3boo9,1587221057.0,"The a few things that stick out to me:

1. There are the are no frames on the art in the dining room. I'd use a wood tone that's repeated elsewhere in the home. Easy fix. I'd do the living room too, but it's less distracting in that room. 

2. From a plant nerd perspective, you filled the dark room with plants that would certainly die. It's hard to get plants to flower indoors, btw, so that's either going to be a fake plant or a dead plant. Both not good choices.  AND the bigger crime is that you have that very bright and sunny dining room - you could put in a really cool sculptural tree - rubber tree or fiddle leaf fig. (Thats like a plant-flex to have a monster tree in your house.) Monstera plants are also very unique looking; I'm sure you've seen prints of them, but they're not that hard to grow. Check out the houseplants subreddit for ideas of what's possible. I'm a fan of filling a house with as many plants as will happily grow while fitting the space. It softens up all the hard lines and wood tones in my own space, which has a lot of mid-century and older antiques. 

3. There's no room for day-to-day living stuff. For example, if you have a record player, you probably have more than 10 records to store nearby. I have a super beefy teak credenza to hold my dining room stuff (to be fair, it's mostly board games). In my opinion, the only way to actually live in a space that's *that* aesthetically nice (and it is lovely, btw) is to put attractive storage everywhere you can so it stays uncluttered. Open shelves don't count IMO, since their contents have to be so carefully curated.

Nice job - I'd want to live there if I could bring my board games and plants.

You get to make your own traditions and celebrate milestones however you choose. 

What I'd do in your shoes is have cookies delivered to where your kid is, and ask your kid to call you for a quick video chat when she gets them. So you get to have a mini-celebration close to the time of the ceremony. And then maybe you have a pizza party when she's back at your place.

BipolarReddit,fn424hs,t3_fz608f,1586632511.0,"First off, self-care for yourself right now includes distancing yourself emotionally from your friend. Her saying that she's jealous of your bipolar and trying to make you serve as her therapist/pdoc... that's so NOT okay. Both of you need a support system that has healthy people in it. When I'm in a mixed episode, I'm easily influenced by the people around me, and I can't be around other sick people when I'm trying to get stable. 

As for finding care right now, online appointments are a thing. I was able to get ahold of  oth my psych and my kid's psych for urgent concerns this week. My kid sees his therapist online weekly. I also help run a support group for bipolar folks, and we run online meetings most days of the week. I've been told that NAMI is running their meetings online, too. Please don't assume that you can't get in to see someone. 

Another resource I recommend is Calm Harm, which is an app that is meant to help you stay safe when you're thinking about self-harm. There's the national suicide prevention helpline, and they have a chat option now too. Your local area may have a helpline too to connect you to local resources. 

You do need meds (obviously) for your health, but you need a doctor who can monitor you and prescribe them on an ongoing basis. Try to remember that mood episodes always end. And that you won't always feel suicidal. It's like having the flu and you keep vomiting. It sucks a lot, but it will stop, and you will feel better. Suicidal thoughts are lies from a sick brain. It's not your fault that your brain is sick right now. Push through and get yourself an intake appointment.

BUT when you emotionally text your ex, you get yourself further away from the result you want. You're going to have to focus on the big picture, and let anger go while you work on your ultimate goal of having a stable, loving household for your kids.

First stop is filing paperwork for child support. It varies by state, but your ex owes his kids money for their needs. The child support is a responsibility to the children, not the other parent. Do not let pride or peacemaking lead you to not filing ASAP. As a single mom, I can tell you it won't even come close to covering the costs of your kids, but you're going to need every penny of it (unless you're independently weathly). Listen to zero boohoooing from the ex about how he can't afford 30% of his salary for child support. YOU will be spending far more than 30% of your own on the children. Daycare and summer camps for 3? Ouch.  

Secondly, visitation. Ideally, he gets his shit together enough for the usual every other weekend and 1 weeknight dinner schedule. Right now, he's clearly in a bad place and isn't capable of navigating parenthood. I'm guessing he feels overwhelmed and like running away from all his responsibilities and relationships. The reason he gave for the breakup is indication of that. Maybe you are controlling, but that might also be what the situation requires. My BFF is a mom of three and what I see is that you've got to be organized and efficient to get everybody taken care of. Especially if you don't have much help from the kids' dad. At any rate, you need a lawyer to make sure you have the parenting rights you want, and to inform you about what ability you have to set the visitation schedule. If your ex is scheduled to see the kids and he bails, that's a big deal to the court. But you have to have the official schedule in place first before he is held to any standard. 

TLDR: Don't angrily or emotionally text your ex - it won't help anything or anyone. Instead, call that lawyer ASAP because 3 kids will make you broke."

Many places won't pay more than $18/hr, despite being awesome at your job and having been there for many years. 

I'm not saying you shouldn't apply to AA jobs if that appeals to you. But I'd tell you to find a career instead that has upward mobility and a higher pay cap."

coparenting,ffsk590,t3_eutnoa,1580183694.0,"I think you really need to spend some time examining why you were uncomfortable with your BF spending time with his coparent and their child together. Based on the ages of everyone involved, your BF and his ex were really young when they got together, they likely went through a lot together as young parents. Ask more questions, without feeling jealous or insecure in your relationship. I think you're seeing their relationship as ""only exes"" rather than people who are going to spend the next 14 years working together on an incredibly important project. They're are going to HAVE to hang out together (kid events, milestones, etc.) And its actually a good thing if they can get along well enough to do that in a friendly manner. 

My ex and I have known eachother since we were kids. His family was my family. We spend time chatting at drop offs/pick ups, and when we have important shit going on, we tend to have longer, more frequent chats about it. We try to support eachother and help the other make good decisions. We have both changed a lot since we split, and I think our chats help us redefine how we see the other. I'm on friendly terms with his fiancee, but we don't have much in common besides the fact that she loves my kids, too. Me being friends with my ex doesn't mean I want to get back with him or influence his relationship. We've just known eachother a long time, and it's a lot easier to be friends when we don't have to live together. I'm not saying that your BF and his ex have the same relationship that my ex and I do, but hopefully you can see that it can be positive for everyone when the coparents get along and spend enough time together to continue to work together."
PMDD,ffnf8nv,t3_eu4gx1,1580065220.0,"I think it's possible that you have bipolar, either along with PMDD or possibly instead PMDD. I have both. They feed on the instability of the other. Getting on different meds may make a big difference for you too. Regular depression meds will make bipolar worse, which in turn makes for more dramatic PMDD episodes. I was at my most unstable and miserable when I was on only an antidepressant (Welbutrin). I was having one serious mood episode during ""hell week"" and then a rebound episode about two weeks later. It was a rollercoaster of shittiness. 

The way you've mentioned your mom's abuse makes me think she has a possible mood or personality disorder. (My dad is probably a narcissist, and my mom has her own mental health challenges.) These things are highly heritable, which isn't your fault. I say all this to encourage you to talk honestly with your psychiatrist. Suicidal thoughts are not something to just wave away. If you were vomiting uncontrollably, you'd see a doctor. Suicidal ideation is every bit as serious. Please prioritize your health before your mom's feelings about your health."

I did some dating with an open-mind and nearly no dealbreakers, but honestly there's a lot of dudes who aren't equipped to be a full partner. Its exhausting, and I'm tired of doing more than my share. It's hard to know how to explain to dudes what I'm talking about when I mean have your shit together. Also some of the ones that think they do have huge blind spots. Ex: living room decor is dominated by an ottoman that their dog destroyed 3+ months ago. I have multiple guy friends that I used to have crushes on with this SAME ottoman issue; hard to crush on someone who lives with garbage in their living room. I don't want to be like, ""I'm not driving 100% of the time because you don't have a car. I'm not hosting 100% of the time because you can't figure out laundry, towels, and buying toilet paper. I want to have a fun weekend without mentally calculating if you're overspending and you're going to complain about being broke for the rest of the month, and without understanding why that might be."" God, it sounds so negative, which is why ""kicking ass at life"" or whatever is the euphemism we are using now.

You can definitely go ahead and block the girlfriend's number; because you are free to block anyone who sends you abusive text messages. 

I think the answer to your question depends on what your actual priorities are for your family. There's so much that you don't have control over - like other people's behavior. But you DO get to choose how to respond to the behaviors you have come to expect. Try to figure out what is the outcome that the Dad&GF actually want (without judging how dumb it is). Try to understand their motivations for wanting that (without judging how dumb/selfish they are).

He hasn't been broken up very long, and he and his ex are still actively working through the wreckage of a relationship breaking up. He's going to have to figure all that out, and it's going to take some time, and probably some therapy. 

You know your boundaries and what you're willing to put up with in your relationship to be with this man. I honestly don't agree with the premise that exes shouldn't be close friends or talk about their personal lives, but you get to decide your own dealbreakers in a relationship. It sounds like his relationship with his ex is a dealbreaker for you, and you are not compatible as a couple. You can't change him, and you're right to be scared that things won't change. Breaking up with him so that he can sort through his breakup is probably the kindest thing you could do in this situation."

... It *IS* superfrustraing to have to take meds to live a normal-ish life. But there are so fucking many people with conditions and circumstances that are similar to ours. You're not alone, and it helps me to think of all of those people. Reach out with your empathy and compassion for all the other people who don't have it easy, either.

Here we go: so so so many people have chronic issues they deal with, issues that limit what they can do or eat. If you're young, remind yourself that your seemingly ""normal"" peers are often suffering in silence with anxiety and depression (and without the diagnosis and meds that could help). Some people are diabetic, severely gluten- or lactose-intolerant, have a fucked up thyroid, have seizures, have CF, have fibromyalgia, and countless other physical conditions. Others have ADHD, PTSD, MS, TBI, or a shitload of other acronyms. How about we spend a second thinking about poverty, widows and widowers, orphans, abuse survivors, and those who have seen war and disaster. These things are often invisible and stigmatized so that we don't talk about it openly, like bipolar.

Sometimes the cracks in our marriage resurface in our challenges for coparenting. I really wanted parenting to be fair and equal (for once), but the reality check I got from trying 50/50 custody was that my ex didnt have the executive functioning skills to take care of himself, much less himself plus two other people. As an example, my son got so many tardies in a short period of time (all dad) that I got a note sent home. We then tried 60/40, 90/10, and others. I finally just put my foot down and said we were doing the SPO for my state because I was exhausted from trying to do it all and manage it all. I was at the end of my rope. My ex's fiance actually was the best thing that happened to my ex - the house was less filthy, and the kids had more supervision and routine. She's really a good person, and sweet to my kids. My ex's parenting skills have improved out of necessity, and I'm able to relax more & worry less when the kids are with him. Weve added Sunday afternoons and that extra dinner as things improved. I try to just think of him as a shitty babysitter. It's not going to ruin them as people to eat pizza and chicken nuggets on dad-time. I still do the vast majority of parenting and problem solving."
coparenting,feaxhj0,t3_eo8krc,1578953220.0,"I'm not sure that I'd replicate the other schedule. As you know, solo parenting three is the opposite of easy, and it sounds like he is in over his head already. 

My kids prefer having some one-on-one time with each parent. I prefer my kids to be with me during the week-- I make sure they're clean, on time to school, homework gets done, etc. My ex wants to see them somewhat frequently, but has a hard time with the ""serious"" stuff of parenting. He means well, but his house is a stinky mess, and they eat pizza more often than vegetables. 

So we do the standard parenting plan with a few extras. The kids have time with their dad every other weekend, plus Sunday afternoons on my my weekends, when I have a standing community thing. He also has 1 or 2 weeknight dinners with the kids -- if it's a week with 2, we split the kids up for one-on-one time with us. Works for our situation, and we all get what's most important to each of us. We try to do 50/50 with school holidays and sick kids days. Make sure that you're not taking them all, just because you're the mom. 

I do think that it's not productive to bend over backward to try to accommodate his travel schedule. When you're married, yes, everyone pitches in. When you're not, that's one of the things that is mostly his problem. We all have to make sacrifices because we chose to have kids, and I think that finding a job with less travel is an obvious choice for a single dad with 3 kids."

By the way you've written about your problem, it sounds like you're not quite seeing potential partners as whole people. Saying ""get a girl"" ""talk to a girl"" etc. makes me wonder how you are approaching these potential partners. Are you truly ready for a relationship? Hopefully you want to date a *woman*, not a girl, considering you're 30 and would like to have a grownup relationship. 

I do think there's a big learning curve to dating at 30+. You've entered a phase of life where knowing yourself, working on yourself, and contributing to your community are important. If you're not already in therapy, you should be. It makes you much more dateable, and will help give you the tools to be the best version of yourself. Looks, charm, etc. will only get you so far.
