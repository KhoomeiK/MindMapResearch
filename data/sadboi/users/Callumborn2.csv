relationship_advice,fpvwfig,t3_gfrak3,1588953053.0,"Okay so I believe that it's not his fault for falling in love with your wife. You can't control who you love. I think it was the right thing to do to tell her. But from what I can gather the way he went about was awful.


He should not tell her with the idea of having a relationship with your wife (obviously) he should tell her because he needs to distance himself from her, as its going to make all 3 of your lives very difficult and awkward, and now has, I assume.


Its definitely best to see him much less if at all for all 3 of yours sake. In my opinion atleast."
AskReddit,fpuww0u,t3_gffps6,1588926561.0,"I was accused of cheating because she found a white hair band with the rest of her hair/make up stuff at my place when she only uses black ones.


I thought it must have been hers, I live alone and nobody else comes here. She must just have forgotte. I tried telling her this but she's so sure that she only uses black ones and I believe her, I've got a decent memory for small details and I didn't recall her ever using any other colour than black.


I'm not a cheater and I never will be. I find it disgusting that somone can do that to the person they love. Eventually we both calmed down, as I was getting quite defensive, and the argument ended but with no real resolution.. Still have no idea where that hair band came from. We've broken up since anyway so I guess none of this matters."

I often have this issue when making music using software, synths and samples. Something will pop into my head, a drum loop or a certain texture of a sound and when I go to recreate it it just doesn't sound the same as it did in my head.

I have however been able to get closer and closer to recreating the sounds and ideas in my head by just making noises. Making noises and remembering exactly how I made those noises, so if such an occasion arrised I would be able to recreate it without too much thought.

Does that make any sense? Maybe try just drawing.. stuff, anything. Sometimes just starting on a blank canvas can inspire a whole plethora of ideas."
