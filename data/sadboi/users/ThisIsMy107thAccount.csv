I was basically spinning on my butt, and my feet never went above my head. One of my supposed ‚Äúfriends‚Äù told a teacher he had a bloody nose because I KICKED HIM IN THE FACE. She fucking believed him, as if some 9 y/o could be a fucking MMO America‚Äôs next ninja warrior and kick him hard enough to give him a bloody nose. Apparently it was broken too but that turned out to be a lie.

My parents also seemed to believe this bullshit lie and proceeded to beat me that night (they were very abusive at the time). I also got suspended for a week and punished every waking minute while I was home. It fucking sucked. 

I‚Äôd also like to add that while I was over by the ‚Äúbar‚Äù during the dance, the kid (along with some friends) walked up to me and asked why I kicked him in the nose.
