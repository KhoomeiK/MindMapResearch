Then I went to Panera (closest restaurant to my house so I went there often on rough days) and ordered my onion soup. 

Found out the soup had suddenly been made ‘seasonal’ in a location it had previously been available year round. Had the employee try and sell the autumn squash soup instead. I gave up hope and ordered the Mediterranean veggie sandwich. Got up to the window, scanned my card, and the same damn employee gleefully exclaimed I had $2 off a soup and didn’t I know it would expire that day?  And the autumn squash soup was brand new and warm and ready to go!  I knew it wasn’t her fault (for the soup change or for remembering my miserable voice) so I just said I wanted a sandwich instead.

People more easily remember the main subject of a conversation but forget the nuance. I’m similar to you in that I love dark chocolate and hate white chocolate.
