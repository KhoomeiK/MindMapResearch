MakeNewFriendsHere,fcv7gpt,t1_fcu3nyy,1577996227.0,It sucks because I really want to be a part of the community and chat but there’s a huge number of guys who make it impossible to feel comfortable and enjoy the game.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fcrpijq,t3_eilogv,1577904886.0,"It doesn’t matter if you have 100 nude pics on your profile. If you’re in a plutonic make friends subreddit, and you don’t initiate that sort of talking, then guys need to calm their shit. This kind of crap keeps me from talking in game chat because the second people find out I’m a girl who plays games I get harassed."
CPTSD,ewqrwp5,t3_cnj6ou,1565676395.0,"Fairly new here (subscribed a while ago but only posted one or two things) I guess this is a good place to put this. Venting because of altercation with abuser. Triggered my PTSD and will wreak havoc on my depression like normal. I don’t know what sort of things need trigger warnings... just let me know if this does.

This month has been awful as it is on my depression. My bad thoughts have come back. Brain fog. All the good stuff. 

Well, I let negative emotion slip when I talked to ex abuser to ask a simple question about one of our kids drs apts, and he threw a temper tantrum calling me all sorts of sweet names. And this gem of a line “And if u think (kids name) living there with a suicidal mother in a disease filled discusting shit hole thats was killing her is anything besides ur selfish controlling desires then u r sadly mistaken..“ (copy pasted directly from message) I stopped responding to him and he spammed me with more sweet messages and because he didn’t get reaction he wanted from me he decided to bring kid over and acted like we’d never hear from him again. He barged into MY apt and took the kids phones and the WiFi box he paid for. He looked for the PS4 he gave the kids, but he couldn’t find it. 

Having him force himself into our home, my safe place, triggered me. His friend is owner of apts and he told me he can come in whenever he wants. And eluded to getting us kicked out. 

After he left, I called the police and put a report in. I’m not shaken anymore. Just don’t have any friends to talk to so this is closest I have. He said some really nasty things and a lot of truth twists or flat out lies. All my kids stuff is over at his place still so not sure if they can get any of that back..."
CPTSD,ewd0zsz,t3_cnk1pm,1565293436.0,My sister hasn’t been able to work because if it for I think a few years now. She only JUST got on disability. Pretty crappy it took years.
CPTSD,ew92zmm,t1_ew92qfh,1565218849.0,"Thank you, I’ll go check it out :)"
CPTSD,ew90quu,t1_ew8yh55,1565217888.0,"Thank you. I’m just starting the whole looking into why i feel like I do on things and have been able to pin point a few things to past abuse with mostly my ex’s. 

But I totally understand trying to tell people what my parents did and just a few examples people are always “so?” And it’s hard to really get in depth of how these little things add up to something big. 

Your responses help a lot. Not just the information, but being able to talk to someone that doesn’t think I’m a huge crybaby complaining over little shit. Or making things up because I can’t remember specifics and just feelings of events. Not sure if I’ve mentioned that in this thread or if that’s something I added in the depression one I was responding to.... I’m kinda outta it recently."
depression,ew8zlfl,t3_cn5vlj,1565217418.0,"I remember the last time I was happy. I think, for me anyways, it hurts more that way. Other times I know I couldn’t remember and just went about the day numb like this is just how it is. But because I remember, I know I’m capable of those feelings and want to feel them again so bad but I just feel so pathetic that I just can’t be happy like other people. I can’t get insurance to be able to get back on those meds either.  I’m just kind of a failure."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew8nygi,t3_cn42s7,1565212533.0,"I was starting to think I was crazy. I’d bring things up to the narc but couldn’t give actual examples, so of course they always say I’m making it up or overreacting. But I know it happened. But it’s just a feeling..."
CPTSD,ew8mk8y,t1_ew8ggz0,1565211901.0,"Wow that sounds very much like me. I can’t ever ask for help and can’t say no. In your opinion, would my mom keeping a list of things she bought me (and me not asking for) and charging me for all of it? Like a huge IOU. So now I’ve always had this sour taste in my mouth if people buy me things because they can bring it up for guilt tripping. She sends me a copy of the updated receipt to get me to pay it from time to time. I apparently owe her thousands of dollars. Or is this something totally different then the covert contract?"
CPTSD,ew8f0z7,t1_ew8cdb5,1565208594.0,"Yeah, I understand for a one little blurb it’s hard to really get the full situation. 

This was the third time he randomly showed up. The other two times it was just him. I made it clear both other times that it really got to my anxiety. And for this one, I opened the door and tried to stop him when I saw his son, and said it wasn’t comfortable for me. He pushed right in, and as he walked into the kitchen I said this really isn’t doing good for my anxiety. He shrugged it off and said tough. Or too bad. Or something in that regard. My brain was starting in on its panic thing by then so I was only partly listening.

And I’ve brought it up to him how I feel like he’s only with me for the gf benefits he gets. He gets upset I would think that, but honestly, every time I’m over there if I say no, he kinda acts like a child and guilts me. This has been giving me red flags. But I’m so far into my depression at the moment I am never sure if my brain is lying to me.

I haven’t heard of the covert contracts but once I’m off work I’ll google it. Your example seems a lot lot not just my bf but my mom too."
CPTSD,ew7oxk0,t1_ew7o2jp,1565195064.0,"I sort of made this post as a way to convince myself to break up with him. My brain keeps telling me I’m overreacting, and he helps with that, but I feel like I’m not and you all really have confirmed I’m not crazy for how I was feeling."
CPTSD,ew7o59e,t1_ew7ndfk,1565194735.0,Thank you! I feel better I’m not actually overreacting.
CPTSD,ew7lfwg,t1_ew7hp50,1565193590.0,I’m sure he wants to be able to say “look at all the things I’ve done for you.” Because I try and point out how he’s being mean to me. So he uses this as ways to prove he’s not mean.
CPTSD,ew7lazl,t1_ew7coaa,1565193531.0,"Oh and while he was over, I hid and cleaned my room. Ever time I’d walk downstairs him and his son were whispering to each other with triggered my anxiety even more. So he didn’t talk a lot directly to me. Like every other time we’ve talked about my depression, he always seems worried he won’t get sex. So there’s that on top of all the other stuff."
CPTSD,ew7kw54,t1_ew7coaa,1565193376.0,I do feel he’s doing it to make himself feel like an awesome guy. When I tell him he’s mean he’s always “how? I did this that and the other thing for you!” Kinda throws it back in my face. I’ve always been in abusive relationships and I’m wondering if my picker is still broken and I’ve done it again.
CPTSD,ew7kluw,t1_ew79zxo,1565193247.0,Thank you :) I’ll work on using that script and see if it helps.

JUSTNOFAMILY,erxhd08,t1_erxh3tu,1561384767.0,"I don’t really see this specific instance as “pageantry”. It’s more wanting her to dress appropriate for a wedding. She gave her a choice as to what she could wear, but didn’t expect something so short her ass could show. I’m sure she doesn’t want her guests to be flashed by her MIL."
JUSTNOFAMILY,erxggjv,t1_erxaw32,1561384075.0,She’s more then a guest though. She’s in the wedding by walking someone down the isle. And the family pictures. It’s a really important day to people. It seems like she wants to save the MIL embarrassment more then herself. She’s not policing a guest.
