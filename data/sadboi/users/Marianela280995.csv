I just don't tell my family or anyone else because they would tell me to do just one of them per day or something like that. Also, lately I've been losing some hair. I notice it when I wash my hair. I think it could be because I wash it everyday or maybe stress, but the last time I lost hair was because of an ED (that time it was more hair loss though), so I don't bring it up either.

socialskills,fn9a9b1,t3_g0ct4w,1586765102.0,"I feel the same with certain activities, and I believe that it isn't much that we fear others but our own expectations coming into play. I mean, when I listen to some kind of music out loud that isn't what I'm used to listen to or what I consider my taste (but I like anyway), I get nervous if others catch me listening to those songs and I quickly change the song to some other. I do it because I don't like when others comment about it or make jokes about me listening to something different or that kind of music, and if someone criticize it then I feel way worse. When it comes to excercise routines, I also don't like if someone is there and kind of slow down or fully stop. I've always been insecure about my body and coordination/physical abilities, and am afraid of hearing negative comments about how I'm moving/look. Both of these activities are very important to me, and I am on the defensive because I'm afraid to be judged about them or how I live/do them. And that's where the expectations I have vs the things that could happen if others are there meet and often crash. Bc I expect whether not be bothered/interrupted when doing these things or that the comments or things others say aren't negative or doesn't affect me. What I try to do when I think/feel these things is to remember that I do things bc I enjoy them, and nothing else. It's easier said than done, tho. When I'm excercising, I try to focus on my body, not how it looks but how it feels, so even if someone says or does something that bothers me, I can go on bc I'm ""listening"" to it and not what others or even myself say. With the music stuff I try to remember that, firstly, I don't have to take too seriously the idea of who I am, my likes and whatnot, that I can like different stuff or change anytime I want to. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and I keep working on it. Idk if this help or resonates with you, but I hope you feel better when doing those things anytime soon!"

limerence,fildogb,t3_f8e3z2,1582499246.0,"My longest LO has a big ego, too. He gets praised bc of his academical success. He is kinda arrogant about it, too. He can be pretty etilist when he believes someone is not ""smart"" enough.  He can be very selfish. He is a good listener tho and convos with him are always interesting. The thing is, I've had to LOs. My other LO is totally different. The only thing they have in common is that they are potheads (I smoke weed too, not as much as them tho). My second LO is not ""academically"" talented, but he plays guitar well and is musically talented, which I appreciate a lot. He is kinder to people and pays more attention to others. However, he is very care free when it comes to how he handles his drug addiction and financial status. I'm no longer very limerent to any of them. Well, I think I got limerent with the second one in order to overcome my limerence to the first one, but I've been limerent with the first one for such a looong time, so I struggle harder to overcome my limerence with him. Anyway, I've come to think that there's a ""drug user"" aspect in my limerence and general attraction to people, and maybe this has to do with the fact that I myself have gone through drug abuse and that my father was an alcoholic.  So drugs are like ""familiar"" and ""natural"" to me, and also having a LO who I can take drugs with makes it easier for me to continue with the habit. I'm now trying to reduce my weed and tobacco consumption. However, I can recognize by having these LOs that the things I do like about both are the things that I enjoy. I haven't been in a university and am not involved in the academical world, but I love to read and learn things by myself. I'm a good listener and like talking about interesting stuff. I'm not musically talented but I love music, singing and dancing. I'm kind and like to be there for the people I love. I guess that the things I dislike about them are the things that I'm not and wouldn't like to be. So, in perspective, the good thing about having these limerence experiences is that I could learn more about myself, although it was, at times, really difficult and hurtful."

When I entered uni I also started to miss classes and fail courses, this time there wasn't bullying involved but depression and anxiety were still there and my social skills were trash (still struggling with it), so I eventually quitted uni too. Fortunately, I'm now doing things I like and have no regrets of quitting uni as I've finally come to accept it isn't for me.

AnxietyDepression,fgj25rm,t3_eyqlsj,1580835556.0,"Therapy: I've had 3 therapist so far. The first one was a psychiatrist, my therapy time with him was 10 years. I think it was ok, good enough not to kill myself (attemped suicide once but it obviously didn't work and I haven't tried anymore) but I didn't feel better either. He was my therapist from 13 to 23, he has almost the same age as my parents, if not older, and although I don't believe he was wrong or that his therapy was bad, I just could never connect entirely with him so there were times when I lied or hide things bc I didn't feel confident enough to say them. This is a problem when trying to figure out what's going on with you bc there will remain unresolved issues and in my experience, the ones that I lied/hid about the most are the things that hurt more and trouble me to this day. I stopped attending therapy with him bc I was falling back on a deeper depression and didn't want any help, I also didn't believe it was gonna do any good. I was tired of meds too, didn't feel anything taking them. The best thing I can recall about my time with him was that he encouraged me to draw (which I love doing), and I really enjoyed the times when I was drawing there and he giving me some tips and stuff. My second therapist was a psychologist. Had therapy with her for like 3 months and then she left town so I stopped therapy. She was my first female therapist (have a troubled story with some women figures that traumatized me and my relationship with other women was awkard, am better now about that and have reconnected with my own gender and so, other women), so it was kinda weird and terrifying for me to open with her. I did tell her some things, but still lied about others. I believed it would have been a better therapist/patient realtionship if I would had been more honest and felt a better connection, and also I was having a tough time dealing with my ED relapse and that shit really changes your mind. The best thing about my time with her was learning to trust other women. My third therapist is my current one. On the first appointment, I didn't know who was in there: male, female, young, old, whatever, I got there knowing nothing about the therapist, unlike my two former therapists. He is maybe on his late twenties/30s, so there isn't much of an age gap there. I started talking and felt good, made a fast connection with him and I was hopeful about it. It was so weird to me to feel easily connected that I even forgot his name and had to ask him again on the second appointment. Things have worked out really good with him and I have found myself being truly honest for once. Being honest about what I feel/think and who I am, even my speech (the way I talk on a daily basis with friends/family) is real this time, something that I was careful to do my former therapists. I feel so connected with this therapist that even I will be going on surgery soon and I won't be able to go out, I will continue my sessions on phone. He suggested it as I believe he is also noticing we are moving forward and things can get better. What I'm trying to say with all of my story (hope it isn't too long), it's that sometimes the first therapist you see it's not the one who you feel connected with and therapy can  feel like a waste of time or just wrong. If you ever feel like that, don't be afraid to be honest about it and look for other therapist, as therapists understand and even suggest that when they feel their patient is not feeling good there. Also, try to avoid lying/hiding things, I know there are things to talk that are way more difficult than others and will take longer to be able to talk about even if it's just the tip of the iceberg of said thing, but if you can, try not to omit them. Therapist will never tell you what to do and what's wrong/off about you. I mean, they won't give you orders to fix a problem and won't determine what is your problem or concern by themselves without commenting you about what they percieve first from what you're telling them. Instead, they will help you figure out and understand yourself better. What I mean is that therapy is a work of two, like a journey of self discovery in which they help you by asking the questions that may help you find the answers or relieve the stress about what may be troubling you. 

Meds: I'd been on meds for ten years. My relationship with them wasn't as good as I would have liked, but I guess they did work sometimes. I went through many meds (remember some of the names, forgotten the others) one of them made me gain a lot of weight, I became addicted to other and I consumed other even when I didn't have to. The one I felt that helped me the most was sertraline for my OCD. I did feel changes and improvement for my intrusive thoughts with it, but my other problems/aspects of myself remained the same. When I quitted having therapy with my psychiatrist, I wanted to quit taking pills too but my parents were afraid of me quitting them cold turkey and made me take them for at least one more year. This year I finally quitted them cold turkey and although the first days I felt weird, I think I am better now. I feel more like myself now, even if that means that I can get more anxious as there's nothing holding back my impulses and personality, I feel that I can finally take care of it by myself and therefore, I am becoming better at it. The good thing about feeling they held me back was, I guess, during my teenage years when I was way more impulsive and self destructive than now, so maybe the best thing I can say about meds is that, for certain circumstances, they work in avoiding suicide/more harm. The downsides are the other physical problems they can cause, addiction and feeling they are no longer working so you keep changing them to the point none of them works. But, that happened to me and I can't assure others that have taken then for a long time also share the feeling.

I hope your therapy and meds go well and that you feel better over time. The first big step, looking to improve your mental health, is already done and for that you should be proud. Once again, hopes everything turns out good for you!"

BPD,fg2pvpp,t1_fg1mzcs,1580451278.0,"I think that knowing you have a mental illness or being by yourself (alone with your thoughts) for extended periods of time give you the idea that you know everything about you, even if you accept/deny/love/hate it. And then, it feels like you were wrong or you never knew your true self bc you no longer feel in control. For me, the first time I thought this, I was destroyed bc I thought that knowing who I was was the only thing I had in my life, even if I didn't like it sometimes, even if I knew how much troubled it was, it was the idea of ""me"", the only thing I could grab and say was mine. It was my home when I felt I didn't belong anywhere, the ""imaginary friend"" that never left. I'm 24 now, and most of the times I consider myself old and almost done bc I want to believe this is it, there can't be any worst and I have seen it all. By all, I mean not the world but the (dangerous) lengths my mind can go if not ""controlled"". I hope I can feel in control again, feel myself again and recognize me on a mirror without feeling fake.

I make plans, I get excited and start believing I'm finally alright. Then, it vanishes. I get back to the point I don't understand shit. Life and its events become alien signs, impossible to read. Who I am becomes meaningless and all the plans and good feelings are lost, to the point it feels they were never there. Like it was a dream but not mine. Those moments are good (while they last, even few minutes), but getting out of that state hurts like hell and is exhausting. I wish I could control how much it lasts or when it happens, but it is like a shooting star. The thing is you can't touch a shooting star or make it stay."

BPD,ffprjos,t3_eui16r,1580103156.0,"I think that the strongest reason you should consider if you don't want to keep the friendship/doubting about it is the fact that being around her is hurting you. Friends, especially the ones that have been there for a long time, are hard to leave even when they hurt you, bc those friendships are the ones that seem to last forever and have been there for so long that is difficult to imagine living without them. But people and circumstances change. I believe that if this friendship is not longer enjoyable and you're struggling to be ok around them, then you are on your right to step away. Maybe they were the best ones to be around years ago and there are plenty of happy/meaningful memories with them, but now they aren't good for you and the times you are spending now are causing you pain. Making new friends isn't easy yet not impossible, so even if you cut your ties with her (and if your other friends ""choose a side"" and are not longer your friends), you may find new friends where you will be moving. Do what it feels is best for you and your peace of mind, and give you a chance to have a friendship where you feel good with them and feel free to talk about/be yourself."
BPD,ffppxkm,t1_ffo6h40,1580101641.0,"I experience something similar. I even gave my three states names bc I wanted to know them. For me, it makes them easier to identify them, what triggers them, how they develop inside and outside my head. By doing this, I kinda understand them better and feel less of a war inside my head when the 3 states fight each other or try to take the light. But I still struggle when trying to command them. Like, I still feel not in control of when and where I will go from one state to another, and when and where I will come out of the current state to other. And yes, these states feel like different people. Sometimes it feels like I restart my life when I go from one to another, confusing who I am and my life so far, my human nature and therefore, life and existence itself. Anyway, finding harmony within these 3 states living together as a whole self is hard, the only thing I can assure is that the more you avoid and deny their presence and the fact they are you, and the more you treat/consider these states bad/wrong/worthless, the harder it is to live with them bc fights/clashes between them get worse."

I used to self harm (10 years approx), and during that time I was using needles to stick myself with in order not to leave big scars as the ones I got from cutting. That day was a rough one and I wasn't thinking clearly at all, I just wanted to hurt me. I went up and started hurting myself repeatedly with the needle. My mom came to me and told me to stop. I didn't listened to her and continue hurting myself and crying. She begged me, and started to cry. I stopped eventually and came down with her. Yet I didn't want to be with people so I lied down on the bathroom floor and ressisted to move. My mom brought me a pillow and a blanket. Later I did get up and went to my room to sleep. I believe this is the worst thing I've done to her bc later I realized how much I made her suffer. I'm not a mother and yet I can imagine how much one can suffer if their son/daughter is suffering and basically one step away from killing themselves and they can do nothing about bc they don't want help/let anybody help them. My mom told me once that, bc of another fucked up thing I did, she thought I was going to kill myself and that she couldn't do anything but see how her daughter is fading away bc I didn't want to get any better.

I hold every relationship I have dearly bc making every single one of them was especial, as I'm not social neither one to feel good around people I don't know/have any true connection with. But most of the time this feeling is one sided, and I end up being just one more name in their phone list while they are all I have.

I'll go through a surgery soon that will keep me home and away from going out for some time, and even if a part of me is afraid friends won't reach out and be bothered by my absence (most of the times I am the one who starts conversation/visits them/go places they like in order to be around), part of me is relieved bc I will be alone, I hope, for most of the time.

Recently I've come to the conclussion that I tend to idealize the figure of the other, and devalue my worth and believe I'm not worthy of their attention/love. Like neither their hate, as I don't do much to bother others, but indifference/isolation feels like the only natural reaction I should get from people. The thing is, I believe this has to do with my social experience so far. Since I was little, I've never done well being social. My parents told me that when I was an infant, I disliked being touched/held by anyone (family basically) besides them. When I started kindergarden, I was afraid of the other children even when I didn't know why. And so on during my whole school experience, plus the bullying and other family problems, and then, university and other social spaces. Anyway, what I'm trying to say, is that maybe I tend to idealize people so much and my relationships with them in general bc since I remember, it's been hard talking/having a relationship with people, and when someone seems to like me, I instantly get attached bc it feels like my last shot on being a social being, despite having my family and friends in my life. And that I should do anything to keep them around or they will leave me and confirm how much of a piece of shit I am, and it would be entirely my fault. When it comes to my friends, I also feel that I'm only good for them if I can do something for them, and that I'm usually too much to deal with and even I'd say that sometimes a bad influence/toxic person to be around bc of risky behaviours and drugs consumption. Now, with erotic relationships is way worse, bc I've never had a partner and seems I'll never will. Maybe bc of how I look, act (impulsive/self destructive), am (mental issues and being honest about them is a bad combo and scares some people) in general. So, I shouldn't even try to love/be loved, bc I could only be a burden if someone ever likes me and tries to be with me. I feel doomed to be forever single and crave the love I see around, but never able to experience it first hand. With my family, I feel guilty. Bc they don't deserve how bad/unstable I am, and that I could hurt them if I hurt myself again. Like all this time, all the effort and love/care they have given me could be lost in a second if I get to a point where suicide is the only option and I finally do it."

All books seemed boring and shitty, and I couldn't keep reading. In those years, I wasn't able to finish a single book, as small as they could be. Since last year, maybe a little bit longer, I started reading and writing again. Last year I could actually read 3 book completely, which is not a lot but it's something. I'm starting to regain all that passion I thought lost and gone.
