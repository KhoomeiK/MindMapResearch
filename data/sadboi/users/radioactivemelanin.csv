TwoXChromosomes,fip87vq,t1_finljzx,1582600205.0,"What’s interesting with abusers and even rapists is they justify their behavior because it’s not “worst case scenario”. Have you ever noticed that? It’s like they think what they did isn’t that bad because they didn’t take it to x y or z. 

I think even regular every day people do this to an extent, too. Take drinking and driving, for example. More people drive under the influence if they are only buzzed, compared to how many people drive when they are black out intoxicated. It seems less bad because they aren’t as drunk as they could be, and they think they have more control over their motor functions. When in reality, driving while buzzed is just as bad as driving full on drunk. It’s just the idea of it not being a worst case scenario that let’s people give themselves permission to behave in ways that are clearly wrong."
TwoXChromosomes,fip7slj,t1_fimy5g5,1582599930.0,"The sword of doubt said it better, but here’s something my abuser said to me that fits perfectly along these lines.

One day, I asked them if they couldn’t control it, then why did they only take their anger out on me and not other people?

They said, “Because they won’t like me anymore”.

There isn’t any other answer that is clearer than that. An abusers image outside the home, the one they carefully put together, is important to them. It’s one of their strongest tools to get what they want from people and to also isolate their victims, because if they are a likable and charismatic person, they get what they want (social status, their place in the community or even family, their position at their job, etc) AND no one would ever believe they are capable of abusing others, because they are such a nice and likable person. Ever notice how during those murder investigations shows, the neighbors are shocked to Hearn their neighbors killed their whole family or whatever, and describe the murder as a “pillar of the community” and no one ever saw it coming because that person was just so nice.

TwoXChromosomes,fip6lg4,t1_fio8mia,1582599163.0,"It’s a good book to read, but you can still support the book and be critical of how domestic violence is talked about and framed or “handled”. There need to be more books and more information available like that book in general. Plus most books about DV and abuse aren’t exactly new, and they are/were on point for when they were written, and still have relevant and invaluable info even though they weren’t written with current day social issues in mind. Some authors go and make new editions of their books to keep them updated, but o don’t see that happening very often. And it should only happen if the person writing the book has experience in that specific topic. I’ve been to counselors and therapist that test their therapy and services in the same way. If they don’t specialize or have significant experience in the matter you need help for, they (should) admit it and send you in the direction of something that will help you more. Otherwise they might be giving you guidance that is counterproductive. 

I’m hoping to see more books come out like this one and really expand on the subject of abuse and domestic violence. For now books like these are pretty much all we have, though."

It’s all about your space being invaded. It isn’t anymore by the person who was doing it. But you’re still feeling the toxicity of it. 

Affection wasn’t an emotion. It was a currency in which you had to pay her to keep her appeased. That’s the opposite and ass backwards of how it should be. It should of been her giving you affection to now sure you were grounded and felt seen and loved. Her demanding it and then shaming you is awful for so many reasons. It’s like when you go to your relatives and they want to kiss you in the face (or even a peck on the lips, fucking gross, by the way) but more intense because it fake from someone you had daily interaction with and this interactions were ones that came up all the time. Doesn’t mean it wasn’t as big a deal if it was a hug. A hug can be a big deal if someone puts toxic shit all over it. No one wants to touch a cookie if it falls into the cat litter box, you know? 

For me it was never having space. Oddly enough, my mother stopped showing me that type of affection after a certain age. The same age she stopped taking pictures of me. I think me growing up broke the fantasy of me being a doll, you know? But I still never had my space. I didn’t sleep in my own bed until I was 23. I have a sense of hyper vigilance, especially at night. Being touched at all makes me extremely restless and sometimes in pain. It’s been so bad at times that I need to sleep with the windows blacked out and all sound drowned out. There are days I can’t sleep until my parter gets up and leaves for work. 

It’s all about space and taking back the space you were never allowed to have. A lot of the work people like us do is taking back our mental space. As it seems even our thoughts and emotions are controlled. But it’s also a very physical thing, too."

sociopath,f84l6hu,t1_f7dcjlm,1574253227.0,Probably not a troll. So many people think anything having to do with mental health is just a meter of “willing it away”. Pretty sure they think they can pray cancer or even a skin tag away lmfao.
sociopath,f84knak,t1_f7x16vf,1574252654.0,"I think they mean did you take on traits from movie characters or make yourself a personality persona based on cool things. Most people do that in general, but there’s a point where it’s more maladaptive than anything if it’s the entire extent that f how someone expresses themselves or tried to appear to have a personality. Some people do it to try and look like they have a personality, when it’s just a bad aid for not really having any depth beyond very basic feelings and motivations."

TwoXChromosomes,f774wrm,t1_f74j86z,1573444064.0,"This this this. You don’t have to call or anything you don’t want to. But you absolutely have the storage to give it a title as serious as the crime that it is. These hard choices and feelings come with the territory. 

Dude yeah. I’ve been in plenty of situations where there was explicitly a “no” layed out during sex for certain acts, and some sex in general. It was so easy to just NOT rape the person who said no. You just have to actually respect them at the most basic level another person can respect another person. I know there’s people out there who do even less than that and only “respect” no’s only because they don’t want to get involved in a situation that could bite them in the ass. But at least they acknowledge there’s something at hand they shouldn’t push past because it’s going to get them into deep shot if they’re stupid about it. Then we have people like the person who hurt OP. They don’t care about OP, they don’t even care they close get into serious shit for this. They just rely on the possibility it will never be reported and OP will never take action on it. That’s what manipulators do in general. This one just chooses to use their manipulative behavior to rape people. Out of all the shitty people they could be, they chose to be that kind."

Family doesn’t keep family members isolated from the rest of the world and spy on them to manipulate them constantly. Of a JSU and did that to his wife, people would call it as clear as day, he’s extremely controlling and it’s abusive. This is no different, and don’t forget it.

But having a paper trail is honestly the most important thing for people who have bene through violence. Not just sexual assault, but domestic violence as a whole. This guy could decide to stalk her and if that were to happen, some kind of report existing would at least be something. I can’t count how man times myself and others have said we wished we made a report about things not even as big as deal as this."

What if it went form just a rape to a beating that left her within an inch of her life? You want to tell me she should risk that just to satisfy what complete strangers think a rape has to look like for the to have to be rape? That she should risk even more pain just so it looks like she did enough to prevent being raped? What kind of rape apologist victim blaming bullshit is this? Would you think it were a rape of he held her at knifepoint? At gun point? Most rapes are not stranger danger. They are by people the victim knows and there aren’t weapons involved. The myth that rape is only a thing when it’s done with a weapon and brutal force is an old and extremely dangerous lie that needs to die.
TwoXChromosomes,f77391k,t1_f74sqgx,1573442744.0,"This is just so bad that I can’t even put words together for it. Please stop giving people pseudo legal advice and also just stop assuming the context of a rape of which you weren’t the victim of. What is wrong with you. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand the threat of risking a more violent assault because they said no and agitated their attacker by doing so, or even more violence besides a sexual assault. Seriously. What the hell we’re you thinking when you wrote that out?"

todayilearned,f7420c9,t1_f73qt7c,1573397274.0,"Hmm, the closest thing to that for me is the time I took strong weed edibles. I’m pretty sure that’s all it was. Well, 15 minutes in, I’m sitting outside at a table  full of people, it’s a summer night. There’s frogs waaaaay off in the distance. 

Suddenly the world lost its gravity and I had to hold onto my chair or I was going to “float into outer space” then suddenly, the planet got its gravity back, but it was 59 times stronger, and if I didn’t cling for dear like, I was going to fall out of my chair and not be able to get up from the force. *Then the frogs came.*

Realistically, I knew how far away these frogs were a block or two away there was a ways and they lived there. But they sounded like they were all around me, everywhere, extremely close and extremely loud. I’ve never heard frogs so loud in my life. 

I started yelling about the frogs and had been trying to speak, but woop! I lost my ability to speak. I was talking, but no one was understanding me. And everyone was talking in another language. I kept trying to tell people I wasn’t okay and they just didn’t understand. It was honestly terrifying because I had no idea it was coming on and I was confused. 

The best or good part about it though was I just felt all my emotions extremely canonically, unfiltered by other mental bullshit, and I stated crying the healthiest cry I’ve had in years. So now I wish I had some of whatever that  was I I could just have good fries where I’m truly in tune with how I feel. If that makes sense. 

I was convinced something else was in the edible, but friend swears that it was just weed. The earth lost its gravity and the frogs cane for me, though, so... I dunno. 

I was also convinced that this one guy at the party was going to hurt me, even though he was my boyfriends long time friend. So when my boyfriend took me inside to lay me down on a bed (so I could come down), I stared begging him to not leave me alone because I thought someone (that guy specifically) was going to come in and assault me if I was alone. 
Turns out that guy actually is shitty in that context. It came out a year or so after that. Dunno, maybe my intuition got heightened or something? 


It was truly a strange experience."
