depression,fp57sup,t3_gaxui1,1588319302.0,"It's really sad, but you're absolutely right. It is so scary to think about life without feeling bad. The idea of feeling better or happy is so foreign. I can't remember what it was like. And since I'm pretty afraid of the unknown right now, I'm also afraid of that uncertain feeling of happiness."

depression,fozpasx,t1_fozowb2,1588194500.0,Maybe it means that we don't really want to die. Maybe we're trying to find excuses for why we can't die yet. Just hoping...
depression,foyygn6,t1_foyubi8,1588181515.0,"Of course, everyone dies at some point. But it comes at its own time. It's not losing, it's just nature. It's how things work..."

depression,foxvdxy,t1_foxv47l,1588157586.0,"It shouldn't be like that. Nobody's life is perfect. Everyone has worse moments. It's just that a depression makes those feelings more extreme. 

I guess you are unlucky with your mom. But please, don't generalize it. There are definitely people who understand and accept. ðŸ˜Œ"
depression,foxv2gq,t3_ga09qc,1588157275.0,"How can she say that? My parents cried and made me promise I would tell them the next time I felt suicidal. In the end, they were the ones to keep me from ending it all. 

It's not like it's a real choice, right? The pain is just too much and giving up is so easy...

I really feel for you. ðŸ˜”"
depression,foxkpv2,t3_ga09qc,1588147070.0,"It's sad, but I know how it feels. It's so tiring to keep fighting. Giving up seems so easy. I was ready for it, to end it all. But I thought of my parents. And I knew I couldn't break them like that. They don't deserve to feel my pain.

Try to find something or someone you don't want to leave behind. It doesn't have to be your parents. It can even be your cat or an object with great emotional value...

Please, keep fighting. I know it's tiring, but still... ðŸ˜”"

depression,fotw486,t1_fotvwfi,1588068233.0,That's right. It gives me some comfort. Although I hate waking up after having such a nice dream... ðŸ˜¥
depression,fotveh6,t3_g9ixmc,1588067500.0,"I have that too for almost half a year now. I got to try 5 different kinds of sleeping pills from my doctor, but they didn't work at all. 

I think it's because we're so stressed out by feeling depressed. Our bodies can't relax into sleep, because our minds are too active. ðŸ˜”"
depression,fotrad8,t3_g9hbbp,1588063321.0,Of course that's not pathetic! ðŸ˜Š Your dreams are your real desires. It's okay to have them... Just enjoy the dream and try to realize it in real life. This showed you what would make you happy and help you.

I don't want anyone else to hurt because of me. But how can I not hurt them when I'm hurting myself all the time?"
depression,foqagle,t1_foqacd5,1587988414.0,"How, when I hate my intelligence right now. I wish I could just be stupid. So stupid that I can't even name feelings. Wouldn't it be so much easier to live like that?"
depression,foqa56s,t1_foq9pfk,1587988147.0,"It did. 

We only feel unhappy now because we have known happiness at some point. We just forget it because it makes the present so much more painful. It makes us feel so much more pathetic."
depression,foq9xjg,t1_foq9ctd,1587987964.0,"I always thought my intelligence was my super power. But I've realized it made me arrogant and oblivious. I thought I could do anything. I thought I would be more succesfull than others.

Now, I think it's one of the reasons of my depression. I isolated myself, was intolerant towards others. I see it more as a curse now. 

I can't even believe there are still people who love me. So, I'm afraid to choose for a wrong 'super power'. Because it might ruin everything again. 

Besides, I'm not really feeling proud of anything right now..."
depression,foq9dqp,t1_foq90sk,1587987478.0,"I don't believe that's true. I don't want to believe that's true. Of course I've been doubting myself too. What if I am just an unhappy person? What if I am just made to be unhappy? But I think, I hope, that we just can't remember happy times. We have pretended to be fine for so long that we forgot how it was before, when we were happy without pretending."

depression,foq8sd9,t3_g8yxhq,1587986935.0,"Of course it's not stupid. It can help you to talk to strangers about how you feel. People closer to you can have more difficulties with accepting the changes in you. Because they know how you were before. It would be difficult for them, because they haven't changed. Your life stopped, but theirs is still going on."

It feels like I'm drowning in these strange thoughts and conclusions about myself. Like I don't know who I am anymore. And that scares me.

I understand, though. But by having a depression you already know life isn't anything easy, right? So do what feels best, what gives you the least stress and the most confidence in moving forward toward healing."
