Journaling could make a difference, I haven't made it a daily practice yet. I'll try that.
It's strange because when I find an outlet for my feelings, such as exercice, pillow hitting or whatever, I tend to get lost in them rather than clearing them. Like the anxiety gets even worse and I can't get rid of excess charge. Only crying to sad songs makes me feel at peace. Seems to be a grounding issue, always living in the mind.

Honestly you can not be happy if you are not fed properly. Everything starts there!!. Your body needs the glucose and a lot of it. If you limit it too much your body starts to run on adrenaline and stress hormone cause you are starving. It's worth researching nutrition and see what works for you. You'd be amazed to see the link between what you eat and how you feel. If you eat properly, you won't need cafeine anymore. 
Also don't go for long periods without eating, that's terrible advice. You are damaging your hormones. If you are hungry, eat. There is no point of going against your body for losing weight. If you really want to control weight, you need to exercise. That will help with serotonin also.
That's just my experience of course but worth looking into.

All I did was briefly talk about my breakup and family situation, open hearted, maybe it was too much and she is incompetent to deal with it.

After 20 minutes she said we can stop it here, opened the door and said if I need therapy someday; when I'm ready, I can see another one.
