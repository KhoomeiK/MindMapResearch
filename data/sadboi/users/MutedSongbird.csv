relationship_advice,fqfhx1i,t3_gimcuw,1589325195.0,"I think that's one of those ""you'll have to cross that bridge when you get to it"" situations - it's very likely that she won't love your children like she loves your sisters'. I know my grandma was very much that way with me and my cousins - and she had the same reasoning, too. ""It's different with your first grandbaby"". My cousins have all over the years ended up at one point or another telling me how much they resent me for my grandma's favoritism - and the worst part is, I think from my 26 years of learning our family dynamics, it was my aunt (their mother) that really implanted that idea into my cousins' heads, that they weren't equally receiving love that I supposedly was. It was just my grandma that didn't *deny* it in any meaningful way, which to us kids might as well be the same as outright saying it's true.


Our family always had to do gifts and shit separately, even Christmas we were only allowed to open *one* gift together, the rest had to go home and be opened separately so that nobody felt like anyone was getting gifts unfairly. The only times I even thought there was any evidence of favoritism was that my grandma had all of her passwords as my name, but honestly I always figured that could be chalked up to me being oldest and old people not liking to memorize multiple passwords if they don't have to. I learned a few years ago that I got double gifts from my grandma because I didn't have a dad giving me gifts growing up, but I totally understand how that would be taken in a negative way.


My grandma, as far as I've ever known, always told each of us that we were her favorite. I was her favorite oldest grandbaby, my boy cousin was her favorite oldest boy grandbaby, my girl cousin was her favorite youngest grandbaby. She would always insist we were her favorites in our own unique way and that the love she had for each of us was different because we were different people. Looking back, I think if my aunt hadn't fed into the mindset that my cousins were somehow being loved less than I was, I don't think they ever would have thought anything was wrong. My grandma did a lot of things wrong growing up, but she was always really good about making sure nobody was left out. 


I guess my advice is try not to argue or make comments about that sort of stuff in front of your kids, if you have them and if it becomes a problem. You can't force her to magically feel any certain way, but you can definitely make sure you're both on the same page that the kids should be treated equally with love."

It came back, eventually, and has been more regular than it was before I started taking it (not sure how common that is but I'm happy it happened). It could just be taking its sweet time, and if you're stressed or not eating properly that can also impact your timeline on having a period.

I knew I wanted to try again and my husband loves this recipe and has been asking me to make them again. By the time I woke up to cut them this morning, he had already cut them and eaten several ðŸ˜‚



Recipe: 

Crust:

1/2lb.    unsalted butter, room temp

1/2c.     granulated sugar

2c.         flour

1/8tsp. kosher salt




Filling: 

6xl.       Eggs, room temp

2 1/2c. Granulated sugar

2 tbsp.  Grated lemon zest (4 to 6 lemons)

1c.         Freshly squeezed lemon juice

1c.         Flour

Confectioners sugar for dusting



I put 30% of my RSO syringe into the crust and 70% into the filling and I'm really happy with the taste.


Heat oven to 350(F), grease a 9x13 baking pan. Very important you grease your pan or these will *cement* into the pan. They'll still be a pain to get out but at least you'll be able to.


For crust, cream butter and sugar until light (I add the 30% RSO here). Combine flour and salt, and add to the butter until just mixed. Flatten dough into pan and press it in, building up a ~1/2 inch edge on all sides. Chill for 20 minutes. Bake 15-20 minutes, until very lightly browned. Let cool.


For the filling, whisk together the eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar, and flour (and the rest of the RSO). Pour over the crust and bake for 30-35 minutes. Dust with confectioners sugar and let cool to room temperature before refrigerating."
Aphantasia,fq54d7q,t1_fq4yhqq,1589092130.0,"It is implied that *if* traumatic stress is truly the root of the imaginations of trauma victims' being deteriorated/gone (their rationale for the loss of imagination was they did a study and asked these people if they saw anything in ink blots and they saw nothing) that it is very likely caused by an imbalance in the emotional and rational brain, where there is a level of extreme mental rigidity akin to what AA calls ""white-knuckle sobriety"" (the author's reference, not mine). It is suggested that ""limbic system therapy"" for the emotional brain is vital to changing posttraumatic reactions. It's not really what the author was studying so much as found to be an interesting side effect of, so it wasn't really addressed with any level of certainty, but maybe it could be a helpful avenue for some to pursue?"

And that's assuming you're even getting the same quality high you're looking for (plus more flexibility in what your edible options are if you're going the DIY route)

Maybe it's not abnormal for your situation, but from where I'm sitting, I'd be worried as hell. 


If he's got mental health issues that are causing him to feel this way and he has no way to cope (you mentioned he's tried meds, therapy, diets, yoga, etc without success) then he may just be a living, ticking time bomb. He can still love you with all of his heart and the depression and other mental health issues can still drag him into the abyss. 


If you find it difficult to talk to him casually, maybe try addressing how you're feeling in a letter? You can hand it to him or read it aloud, but it might help you to organize your thoughts because I think it will do your relationship a lot of good to be very clear that his shit talking your mom and her boyfriend isn't acceptable or healthy behavior and it's detrimental to your mental health to have to put up with it."

Those people weren't your friends, they were friendly acquaintances out of convenience. You sound like you're in a better place, mentally, maybe it wouldn't be a horrible idea to reach out and get closure, or maybe even (best case scenario) reignite your friendship with the ex and build from there? Also possible he says he's not ready to go there, and to not contact him again, but idk personally I'd rather shoot my shot than spend my life wondering what would have happened if I did. You know your mental state better than I do, and that may not be something you're ready to hear yet, and *that's okay too*."
