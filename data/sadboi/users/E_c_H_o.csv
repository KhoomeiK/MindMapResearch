TrueOffMyChest,fqgaj2s,t1_fqezr7s,1589341561.0,I'm very much in those weird Tumblr queer communities and I've been around otherkins and furries and the like. This whole fake pronoun stuff was maybe a thing a couple years ago and even then I've probably seen one or two people total actually using those pronouns. I feel like it has totally died out and I've never seen it again. That's why I think this post is kinda dumb.
TrueOffMyChest,fqga5oj,t3_giehvx,1589341316.0,"Let's be real, ""ze"" and ""xir"" pronouns or whatever died out around four years ago and had such a minority using it even at its peak. This post is trying to make it out like the whole neopronoun thing is threatening to take over in this day and age. It isn't. I haven't seen or heard anyone using neopronouns in so long and I'm very much in those communities who used to have people who did. It's not even a thing at all."
