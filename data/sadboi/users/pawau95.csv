It‚Äôs just how the world works bro. I can only speak for myself but I only care about my close family and my dog. To be honest if someone I know dies, yeah it will be sad for a couple days but after that the world moves on. you still gotta pay rent, food, car bill, credit cards etc. money is the one thing that everyone truly cares about. I mean even when you die someone is gonna need to have cash to pay for your burial."
