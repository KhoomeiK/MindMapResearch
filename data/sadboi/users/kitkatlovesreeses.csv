Even if my Mom goes on to reject my relationship with my bf is rather have a life of my choosing than be forced to hide who I am and wonder what could have been for the rest of my life. 

Sometimes it feels like they don‚Äôt even value me as a person. When this stuff comes up they forget that I am a smart, independent person that is successful in school and contributes to society and has an identity of her own.
