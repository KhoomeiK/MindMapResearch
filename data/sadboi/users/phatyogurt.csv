scholarships,fqq0hv4,t1_fqq044h,1589557289.0,"I applied for a number of random scholarships back in March and April, and I just looked at their websites and noticed that a bunch of them notify their winners today.  Usually scholarships notify their winners in the middle of the month or at the end of the month. I guess not databases, just a coincident that they all release they’re scholarships today"

scholarships,fp8vm3h,t3_g7qwrr,1588404527.0,"For federal loans, yes. But let’s say you get a scholarship but you already took out a personal loan that covers everything: then no. But you can still get to the point where your college gives you that scholarship in a  refund check. You can use those for anything, so I guess yeah you could use it to pay off those private loans."

DumpsterDiving,fp540g6,t1_fp51egn,1588315579.0,Ikr!! They were right next to the lights when I looked in the dumpster. Couldn’t resist!
DumpsterDiving,fow61q3,t1_foucee7,1588113676.0,"Yeah by now the peak has passed so there’s not a TON of stuff, but I’m still finding cool things here and there. What I would do is look up PSU’s academic calendar and see when the semester ends. Some people are still living in the dorms, so maybe you can snag some of their treasures when they move out :)"

bipolar,fnnqy58,t1_fnnki67,1587099183.0,"Wow, 9 months is a long time. I applied back in December and I heard back today. Maybe it depends on where you live. But 9 months?? That’s crazy.

And yeah, I agree. It really does make me feel useless, too. Some days I feel alright but other days I understand why I’m disabled. I need to realize that I’m sick and this isn’t my fault at all. I’m not lazy, I’m just too sick to function. I guess that’s just something I need to accept."
bipolar,fnnqhff,t1_fnnmbe2,1587098826.0,"Thank you for giving me some hope. I really do appreciate it. Sometimes I question if I’m really mentally ill or if I’m just being lazy. It’s easy to get in that mindset. I know that right now I am too ill to work, but sometimes it does feel like I’m playing the system. I’ll have some days where I seem like a normal person, but then I’ll have other days where I totally break down and stay in my room for a couple of days. I guess that’s what mental illness does to you. 

Thank you for reminding me that my illness does not define me. These groups really help me, too. It’s really nice to talk to people like you who can relate to what I’ve been going through. Thank you for your kind words :-)"

Psychosis,fnjz3sv,t3_g21dx7,1587010485.0,"I get this too! I tried to describe this to my sister, and she had no idea what I was talking about. It’s just a certain “something” that you can sense when it’s there and when it’s not. 
This “something” feels like trying to describe the color red to someone who’s colorblind. It exist but it’s just indescribable. It needs its own word. 
Idk how to keep it for a long period of time. The best thing that I could suggest is to really recognize when it’s there. For example, you can scarf down a piece of chocolate cake in like 30 seconds. But if you really stop and think about the flavor and taste and smell and texture of the chocolate cake, then you’ll more likely remember it and it’ll probably last longer since you’re taking the time to recognize it. 
Maybe this isn’t what you’re going through. I hope this all makes sense. Sometimes mumbo jumbo comes out of my mouth. LOL. Hope this helps."
disability,fnidbcq,t3_g0uywd,1586978067.0,"I am 18 too and I live with my dad and stepmom. I filed for disability back in December because I have a serious mental illness that keeps me from working. I think the disability office looks at every case differently, but from what I recall, they didn’t really ask me much about my parents. I looked on one of the websites and it says, “If you’re an adult and receiving SSI, then the SSA only considers your own income and other financial resources.” I find out tomorrow if I get disability, so I will update you then! I’ll let you know if living with someone does affect your claim."

bipolar,flznqsu,t3_fs0io1,1585628315.0,This post gives me hope! I just started on Seroquel about two weeks ago. This is after gaining 30 pounds on abilify. I’m hoping that I can see some results like yours at some point. Congrats !!!
Psychosis,fjpmfet,t3_feemzj,1583554784.0,"Last month, I had a memory that I bought a $50 lottery ticket and hid it in my room (my family doesn’t like me gambling, so I used to hide it from them). When I remembered that I had hidden the lottery ticket, I went into my room and started searching for it. I tore my room apart looking for it. I could not find it, but I swore that I had bought one and had hidden it behind my bed. To this day, after moving everything out of my room, I still never found it. I have been going through a manic period for a couple of months now, and stuff like this has been happening all the time. I swore I had a cat when I was a kid, but all of my family members call me crazy. I had no idea this was psychosis. Maybe I am crazy."
bipolar,fhjbde8,t1_fhi61la,1581642005.0,"I gained so much weight on abilify too :,(
It’s rough but hang in there sweetheart"
bipolar,fgiogfq,t1_fgh4tp6,1580827220.0,I noticed it a few weeks in. It’s tough to say for me though because I started it in early December and I started gaining weight around Christmas time. So it could’ve been the holidays or it could’ve been the medication. The weight gain didn’t stop after the holidays though.
bipolar,fggu30t,t1_fgfavt9,1580769583.0,I’m on 20 mg aripriprazole and the weight gain is sooo bad. I’ve gained 30 pounds in two months. Rip

bipolar,ffvtyr2,t1_ffvfyrs,1580273185.0,"I’ve been on lamictal for about 4 months now, and I’ve had zero problems with it. It’s actually my favorite out of all the medications that I’m taking. Over the next few months I’m supposed to increase my lamictal all the way up to 400mg. Right now I’m at 100mg with no problems, but maybe later on something will change. Hopefully not lol.
I’m meeting with my psychiatrist on Monday, and he’s going to change my meds. I’m hoping to get on lithium, but I’ve heard there are a TON of side effects. How is lithium for you?  
Since everyone on here is raving about seroquel, I may suggest that to my psychiatrist. Thanks everyone for the tips! I love this sub already."

bipolar,ffva6xj,t1_ffv8u39,1580259335.0,"I mostly experience dizziness, but one thing that I’ve noticed is that I drool all over my pillow at night. It is the weirdest thing. I never did that before I started Abilify. I talked to my psychiatrist and he said it’s a possible side effect. It’s an awful side effect tho because I wake up in a giant pool of wet, so wet that I’ve had to put a trash bag around my pillow so I don’t ruin it. lol. 
Abilify really just makes me feel weird. Not like myself. I’ve also gained like 10 pounds in the past two weeks even though my diet has been pretty regular. 
I’ve never taken olanzapine, but hopefully if I do, it won’t be as weird as abilify."
bipolar,ffv8sps,t1_ffv0w81,1580258399.0,My thoughts exactly. Haha

depression,ffgss9y,t1_ffgsbyw,1579914135.0,"Thank you for your reply. Yes I am on medication. I’ve been on Prozac & Abilify for a few months now. I just got a lamictal as well. They don’t seem to be working, but I’ve been advised to wait to see if I feel better. That’s my real problem, and it seems like the only thing I can do is wait for my solution. However I wish there was something that I could do in the meantime to feel happy faster."

depression,f8ap8t9,t3_dzx6ob,1574405287.0,"I’m in the same boat. I have been experiencing this feeling for the past few months, and it doesn’t seem to be going away any time soon. Everything is perfect in my life, and I should be happy about it, but I’m not, and there’s no reason why I shouldn’t be happy. The good moments are good, but that good feeling never lasts for some reason. The happy stuff just isn’t enough. Life just tastes like stale bread. 

I’m no expert, but it sounds like you are also suffering from anhedonia (A symptom of depression). There’s a lot of stuff on google about it. I’ve gotten some good tips from that. I’ve also just started on medication and am now going to therapy. Hopefully that stuff helps. 

People have said they’ve escaped this feeling before, so there is some hope. Good luck dude."
depression,f876nla,t1_f84cpqy,1574318134.0,"Sorry you’re in this boat too. It’s not a good boat to be on. It’s good to know that others are able to feel the same way we’re feeling right now, though. 
It’s been tough, but I do remember some of my good moments. I remember I used to feel good all the time a few years ago, but I’m not sure where that feeling went. I have completely forgotten how to feel any pleasure. I guess my problem is that I have never gotten out of anhedonia land before, so I’m not sure how to even start to escape. I’ve been feeling this way so long that I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try and get out. How did you get out the first time?"
depression,f84b0y0,t3_dyyw5m,1574238872.0,"I was kind of in the same situation as you. In college I started falling behind because of my depression, and all my responsibilities kept building as I tried to cope with my problems. It all became too much. I was going to drop out, but I couldn’t afford it. The scholarship that I have wouldn’t be awarded to me again if I decided to re enroll after dropping out. So my counselor told me to take a medical leave instead. Idk how your university works, but maybe talk to someone about a medical leave. If you take one you, then you can go home and get all your ducks in order, and then you can return to uni feeling ready and confident in yourself and your studies. 
This is what I’m doing right now, and it’s really relieving. I can work on my mental health without the pressures of school and friends. I wish I had done this sooner. Taking care of yourself is more important than I had initially thought. 

Good luck bud, and I hope everything works out for you!

Edit: On my medical leave I got a refund for the tuition I had paid."
