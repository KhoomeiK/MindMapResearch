Teachers,fq2836e,t3_ggil7m,1589053681.0,"This unusual year is also the year of my summative evaluation.  I’m a middle-school teacher (20 year veteran).  Before shit hit the fan, I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and thinking I was headed for a breakdown.  Even though the buildings are closed, teachers still have responsibilities to their students, administrators, contracts, etc.  We’re working just as hard, if not harder under unprecedented circumstances.  The people that assume we’re doing nothing are probably the ones who went to school just to graduate.  
My SO’s son was in 4th grade this year, and due to them not being a one-to-one school, he’s been done with school since March.  I’m sure those teachers are still working in some capacity.  No school system is going to pay teachers to do nothing.  Not with budget deficits and cut-backs planned for next year."

I’ve never birthed a child, but I can say with no doubt, the insertion of the IUD was the most pain I’ve ever felt in my life.  
It was inserted in July of 2018 and, unfortunately expelled last Tuesday night.  I didn’t feel a thing.  My boyfriend found it in the bathtub.  Even though the insertion is excruciating, I’m getting a new one inserted at the end of the month.  Benefit outweighs the pain.  I am extremely happy with this method of BC."
