Anxiety,fpq0cw2,t3_geiyn7,1588812653.0,I almost didn’t comment because of this exact reason! 😔
depression,ev7adk8,t3_cig81w,1564257241.0,"This post really resonated with me OP. I’m sorry that you feel so hopeless and that life is pointless too. ☹️ Everyday, I try to find something to make the day worth it; somedays are harder than others. On those days I just stay in bed a bit longer! 😆 Anyway, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I hope it helps a little knowing you’re not alone. 💜✌🏼"

Anxiety,etwchtw,t3_cdmy2t,1563263326.0,"I do this often and have to remind myself to be mindful of stopping if I am ruminating. If I don’t stop it immediately, my mind will spiral until I’ve replayed the entire conversation. 🙄 
I understand your frustration and am sorry you deal with this as well. Hoping you find something that helps you! ✌🏼"

You do know tampons go in the vagina and not the rectum, right?"
depression,et5eqg8,t3_c9z6zv,1562471715.0,I feel just like this too. The only time I look in the mirror is when I’m applying or taking off make-up. 🙈

Depersonalization,esvbeiy,t3_c949vy,1562296510.0,It sounds to me like you have depersonalization/derealization disorder as these are all symptoms. I too have this disorder and feel some of these things as well. The only way to know you have DPDR is by how you’re feeling on a day-to-day basis. Try keeping track when you feel this way and what you were doing when it happened so you can find your triggers. I hope this helps you a bit. I know this can be a very frustrating disorder and I wish you all the best. 💜

Depersonalization,esol1s9,t3_c8pok4,1562169661.0,Caffeine triggers depersonalization for me as well. It’s tough getting though the day when you’re tired without it but I’d rather be present. Maybe try a B12 supplement for energy? 😊

askwomenadvice,esn4wdi,t3_c8gnea,1562122671.0,So sorry to hear this is happening to your friend. If she could possibly get some of this behavior recorded that would be GOLD. 🎥 I imagine it’s hard to fire someone when they can prove you’re a pervert.

Try and take life one day at a time. It’s ok not to label a day as good or bad. It’s ok to just have a day. You are not alone! 🤗 💜
