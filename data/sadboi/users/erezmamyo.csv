SuicideWatch,fnw50yd,t3_g48v49,1587311571.0,"I can’t explain how much it hurts me that you have to endure this.  I went through the exact same thing.  I’m 30 now.  I am still extremely depressed.  My mom was probably like your dad.  She’s changed now but I was convinced I’d commit suicide my whole life and I was very close multiple times.  Our parents want us to be their barbies they can brag to their friends about.  They don’t understand that mental health is more important than school.  You need to be open with your dad about your mental health and ask him “what’s more important to you?  Me getting good grades or me killing myself.”  Many kids your ages have killed themselves.  People don’t take it seriously until your dead.  Find good treatment, meds, if you need someone to talk to I can be there for you 24/7.   I used to pray I could treat my mental health when I was 13 instead of now when I have 17 additional years of traumatic memories and my self hatred is so automatic now it’s hard to overcome now.  Please show your dad my message and my songs as well.
