THEY SOUND HORRIBLE I don't know how to fix it. I'm working on bow placement but I think it's not the problem here. My hand trembles a lot, maybe I should lift some weights? I've never been a strong person.

For the intonation, do you think I could use a chromatic tuner or something like that? I hope there's an app that works like one of those...

Dunno, if you have any idea about what I can do, please tell me! If you need a video I can try taking one"
