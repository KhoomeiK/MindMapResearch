I would challenge you to cut out all meat and it’s byproducts from your diet for one whole day. I took that challenge and honestly it just stuck with me, and there’s no shame if it doesn’t for you. From there you can look at other things you frequently buy, wear or consume and how it affects animals and the environment and maybe start cutting back or finding friendlier alternatives. 

Speaking of which, if you want to feel inspired to do better instead of sad, guilty or shameful, make sure you watch the game changers on Netflix. Best of luck to you buddy!"

I have 6 siblings and only one has gotten tested so far (also a negative thankfully). So for us, independently, it hasn’t been a priority. It’s been a part of our lives since we were all born so we probably have a very different perspective. Just ask yourself a few questions and answer them honestly. Write the answers down in a diary if you need to so you can visualize it, add to it, and reread it:

Where do I want to be in 10 years? Will not knowing prevent me from achieving that? Will knowing help me achieve that? How do I truly think I will handle the test result? Whether positive or negative, will it empower me or weaken me? 

Just some food for thought."

Within a couple of days I ran into an old friend who hooked me up with the best job I’ve ever had with many more of my friends joining along.

I truly felt miserable at that job, so much so that I didn’t care about having a job lined up or the fact that I would have to most likely live in my car for a bit (which I did)."
