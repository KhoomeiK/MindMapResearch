Can we? They've already started hand-picking media outlets for closed briefings. 

I disagree with your assessment that Remainers are anti British. We're anti Brexit. 

We wanted the best for this country, the government stubbornly marched forth with Brexit (why wouldn't they? bowing out of EU regulations means less controls for the government to obey, less courts of law and appeal for for issues to go to, and actually removes protections for the citizens of the UK, including worker's rights. If the economy struggles, the rich don't have to feel it, it's only the lower and middle classes. We cannot kid ourselves that the rich care about the poor, and we cannot kid ourselves that the majority of the electorate care about anything that isn't strongly emotional... which is human, but it does not add up to a country as typically dispassioned as the UK ever getting riled up enough to seriously hold their politicians to account.)

Holding the government accountable only works if the government will allow itself to be held to account. The UN is ineffective at helping with non-violent-conflict matters, as seen with the outrageously machinated events surrounding the presidency in Brazil over the past 10 years, which the UN has condemned but achieved little about. 

Brexit is basically a bet that the government will care about its people instead of itself and its peers (media, oligarchs, big business). I have low hopes."

Careful with this. My uBPD used sleep deprivation as a tactic, would start arguments late, would not allow me to go to sleep, would chastise me for being drowsy because of medication, and I would either be so exhausted I would be falling asleep WHILE STANDING, or I would have to fake sleep sometimes to exit the nightmare.

I will say even in a non-BPD relationship the ""I feel you're being \[emotion\]"" line in response to a request for reassurance (whether it was presented as a request or is the underlying need behind whatever was said) isn't great communication unless the person has said ""if I'm acting in \_ way, call me out on it please"". I think anybody would interpret that as ""so my needs are being ignored and it's being turned around onto me?"", which... yes, people are responsible for their own anxieties and insecurities, but unless it's a neverending part of the relationship no matter what the person being asked does, I don't think it's unreasonable for people to want reassurance sometimes. You can also reassure someone AND end on a ""I think given \[facts\] that you're being insecure, but I understand you"", but it might not be something to lead with.

Back to BPD. There are specific ways to try and communicate with pwBPD. They might not work. 

And if they're denying being insecure, well that's some major defense mechanism going on there, and if they're insisting that because they're insecure about something it must be true and you need to admit to it otherwise you're lying... in my experience there's no response to that, just state that you understand they feel insecure and scared, but what they're worried about isn't true and you won't be forced to admit to something untrue, and if they continue trying to make you you will exit the conversation.

nonmonogamy,f2zrayz,t1_f2zdx0n,1570535899.0,">when I was in past relationships all non communication usually meant something was wrong.

This is important. Not all non-communication means something is wrong. 

Some people have different energy levels and needs. Introverts or people who have come out of a controlling situation especially tend to need the freedom to not feel forced to respond.

Ask yourself, are your brief messages because you just want to wish them well, or are they done in expectation of a response? The former is good (but you need to clarify that you just want to wish them well when you send brief messages but don't expect a response), the latter is a symptom of an anxious impulse. 

Ex: I usually hate good mornings and goodnights every day. It makes me feel trapped in a routine and like someone is trying to dominate my schedule and thoughts. But if I know and can trust that someone isn't trying to do that and doesn't expect reciprocation and just wants me to know they're thinking of me, I can be okay with that. But there is nothing they can do to prove that to me besides communicating their intentions openly and giving me time to witness how they act.

Ask her what she thinks of messages like that and how they make her feel, and how she prefers her partners to communicate with her.

With you personally, it sounds like you are having anxious thoughts and feelings. It sounds like you're willing to overcome them, which is good.

Have you looked into CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) worksheets online? This might help you learn your pattern of anxious thinking and overcome it. Overthinking is a pain, but there are methods of controlling it.

I think this would help with your problem. 

Besides that, make sure you communicate, understand a hierarchy isn't necessary for all people and doesn't make anyone more or less valued, if you're having to wait a long time for face chats maybe you could talk over the phone?"

The problem is that any treatment they can do has to be patient-led. You can't take a pill to stop your personality, but you can do lots of cognitive and emotional management to minimise the neurotic and damaging parts of your psyche to the point the malignant parts of your personality can reduce and be effectively controlled.

But doing that means admitting accountability in the first place AND sticking with it, and as you and many others aptly observe, that isn't something that comes easy to pwBPD. Especially if they externalise all of their feelings (internalising it instead of projecting it I think has a better prognosis, because they don't have to do extra ego damage in order to take accountability.

What the hell is this stuff about ""female dominance""? Who the hell is out there trying to achieve that (outside of the bedroom)? Equality is literally all we want, this is the result of some major silly scaremongering. Literally nobody is trying to subdue non-women. Gender issues are all sides of the same coin. Feminism is about equal treatment for men AND women AND other gender identities and expressions, it is not just about women getting on top of the dogpile. It's recognising there are centuries and millennia of socially coded behaviour and attitudes that need to be broken down before we can all be on truly equal footing.

And the ones who do seem to not want to be around men? They've probably been through so much stuff and been beaten down for so long that they are done and want to be away from the pattern and common denominator to minimise the risk of it happening again. Sucks for the nice people, yeah let's hope they get gelp and healing, but let them have their moment where they can actually feel and express their frustration. People are not robots.

You apply it, not the therapist. They only guide you. This is tough for some people to accept.
2. CBT is often used for things like anxiety and panic and any kind of cognitive distortion. This is great for people who display those symptoms in CPTSD. But there are extra elements with trauma that function differently to anxiety, and so which can't be resolved with CBT alone, or will take a lot more digging and painful exploration to figure out how CBT can be applied. This is too painful for many people. That's okay.
3. CBT is often used to resolve conditions caused by chronic stress (physical) or over-worrying (mental/cognitive), whereas trauma comes from the outside world and is often ""personal"" in nature. They might co-occur, you can use CBT to treat many of the symptoms, but there is that pain that requires something different, and that's something everyone has to figure out to find a way to resolve or come to terms with to remove the danger from their brain.

It's important to remember you aren't the cause of the after effects of the abuse, but you ARE the cure and you can influence and reduce the after effects.

NarcissisticAbuse,f0yfv5i,t1_f0yc7an,1569069621.0,"Ahh, the classic ""I can't admit responsibility so I'm going to say WE have a problem and they are OUR issues now I've realised you're presenting resistance"" and ""my bad feelings are your responsibility, not mine""!

What's even better is when they keep telling you that people's problems and emotions are their own responsibility, which my ex did all the time. Presumably helped him dodge the shame from not caring at all despite claiming he is an empath who can't get other people's suffering out of his head. Totally agree with your comment on blame-shifting to preserve his self-image as ""not a negative person.""

Same! I had an idea of narcissistic personality traits thanks to a previous ex (who only started fully manifesting borderline delusional narcissism after we split), but I didn't know about the narc abuse cycle or personality disorder until my last ex kept telling me I was a narcissist and abusing him and that I was to blame for the circular conversation as a way of derailing him. 

No way - I'd tried every proven problem solving and  conflict deescalation technique out there to no avail, until I figured his way of doing things must really be the answer like he kept telling me and I was stupid and crazy and selfish like he kept telling me and my guilt led me here. Yet somehow the circles never stopped until I left, and I remembered the only other time they have existed in my life was with the previous ex.

It's so undeniable once you see it."
