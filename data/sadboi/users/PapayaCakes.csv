C25K,fp5rmc4,t3_gbexd2,1588338279.0,Just finished W1D1 also and I thought it was a pretty good challenge for me who's never been a good runner. Let's keep it up!

KDRAMA,fktktz7,t1_fktexpa,1584524441.0,Good point! Thanks for the clarification.

KDRAMA,fkgbxms,t1_fjnv7hi,1584155279.0,"Regarding Geun-soo turning evil, does anybody else remember the scene from episode 2 when Soo-Ah first meets Jang Dae Hee, she also meets young Geun-soo outside, who was CRUSHING ANTS WITH HIS THUMB! They already foreshadowed for a while that he is inherently evil."

weddingplanning,fdqc8yy,t3_emk08n,1578662744.0,"Omg that's my dream cape too! It just turned out to be too expensive and my dress has no sleeves. :(

I've decided to go with this one that wraps around the chest area. I'm not sure how it would look with your dress though. Just giving you some other ideas!

weddingplanning,fdqasn8,t1_fdocs6k,1578661451.0,Omg are you me?! My dress is also hanging on our bedroom closet door. My fiance also even told me that he would like to be surprised when I told him I feel like I want to show it to him already!
weddingplanning,fdqamlq,t3_ema5m7,1578661296.0,Haha I'm the opposite! I wanted a ball gown dress with lace and sleeves and ended up with a classic strapless A-line. ðŸ˜‚ I still love it though

Anxiety,f3e5835,t3_dgqctf,1570858281.0,"Honestly I don't know either. I make very shallow friendships because I just don't know how to connect with anyone on a personal level anymore. I feel like I've lost that part of myself that is tangible and all I'm left with is this empty shell of me with no substance. Of course, no one takes interest in a dull shell. I feel like I have nothing special to offer to other people. I'm too anxious that I just can't function without questioning my every thought, word, or action. I wish someone would just ask me what's wrong with me. But even I don't really know how to explain that the me they see, isn't really ""me""."
findapath,eon7tho,t3_bsco3m,1558706296.0,"You sound just like me. My interests shifted widely from IT, to graphic design, baking, music, philosophy. I got nowhere because I didn't stick to anything. Now I am taking my bachelor's in Nursing and I'm determined to get something out of this. Nursing is a good blend of sciences and humanities and not much math (I'm not good at math either), lots of job availabilities, specializations to practice, etc. There's always room to grow and things to learn. So there's that. I'm not telling you to be a nurse, but maybe find something that is practical, stick to it, and see where it takes you."
