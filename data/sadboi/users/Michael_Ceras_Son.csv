 What they say to you isn't automatically true. Logically speaking. If someone were to walk up to you and say you're God for example, you wouldn't believe them because you know it's not true. Same thing if someone calls you a derogatory term. Labels don't work because no one is one thing all the time. It's as simple as deciding not to buy into anything they say. Harassment is not a form of criticism, so it holds no actual merit.

Realize you're not responsible for anything they feel or say. It's all on them at the end of the day. And with that realization over time, their words will just be.. Words. Opinions. That don't hold any real world value."

As if they were shaped by waves so clear that you could see yourself in their reflection. It smelled of ash and burning wood. Crust crumbled around its aura. With each belly driven breath, came the thump of his heart ‚Äî as explosive as a hundred thousand tons of dynamite. 

God paid no mind to it. The hands of creation did as they willed among the pillowy clouds. This silver city. God peered down below, catching the occasional glance at the monitor. ""Yes I tried disconnecting it then reconnecting it.""

A  hushed voice spoke back to him down below in the pits of hell.

God spoke back to it. ""It says my Origin account is not linked to twitch. Is this your doing, Lucifer?""

An angel tapped God's shoulder. His skin had turned ghastly pale. ""My lord.""

""Not now, Michael. I am busy.""

Michael shook God's shoulder furiously. ""My lord!""

God grumbled to him self and hung up the call from down below. ""What, what is it? What is so important?""

Michael pointed ahead at the beast that lay in the chamber of creation. God's jaw dropped. *It was supposed to be a lizard.*

The creature roared mightily, shaking the very foundation of creation itself with a song so loud it'd burst any mortal's ear drums.

""Oh shit."" said God.

""What do we do?"" Said Michael. ""Can you destroy it?""

As the creature lumbered through the clouds with his green hide, God snapped his fingers. ""No I can not decreate such a construct. But I may shrink it to half its size and..""

""And..?""

""I'll just ‚Äî put it near the earth's cores like the others ‚Äî it'll be fine.""

This is when I approached the lone home. The door sported an usually vibrant crimson. Something about it seemed ‚Äî alive. I ran my fingers against it and was met with an intense vibration that coursed through my hand. I jolted back, and the door flung open with a bang. The light from the other side of this door blinded me and the pressure in my head skyrocketed.

It felt as if a baby were trying to hop out of my skull. No matter, I need to go forward, I have to. Something deep in my very being says so. I walked in with my arm shielding my eyes, the rays of the sun toasted my skin and the stench of gasoline invaded the room.

""Why don't you take a seat, bucko,"" said a voice from behind. I turned to see who said that, but was greeted with that blinding light. Two hands pushed me down and I fell into some kind of seat that was bent out of shape. *Is this a car seat?*

""Open your eyes now,"" the voice said. That familiar voice sounded like me. I opened my eyes once more and was greeted with a large television screen. The film showcased the point of view of a woman, crawling out of a crashed car. Injured. Ambulances wailing around the streets as law enforcement locked down the area.

I saw my car from their point of view, a crimson corvette flipped over. With a body that appeared to be mine, crushed by the vehicle. My heart sunk.

A man sat next to me, he looked like me but a few years younger. ""We told you not to do it.""

Another sat next to me on the right, ten years younger than me with tired eyes that seemed to have weeped earlier."" We were all telling you not to do it.""

I scanned this impossibly bright room. This all encompassing light, every iteration of me in my lifetime was present with looks of contempt, sadness, and anger in some cases.

I couldn't speak.

I didn't want to.

I know what I did.


The pressure in my head intensified and I clasped at my temples. I feel so light. I feel so light. Like a feather. Like I'm not here. 

I stumbled, ""Am I already..? I mean, is it too late to go back? I can't be.. Did I kill anyone?""

The man said, ""Just one person. You picked one hell of a night to get drunk."" 

""Oh, I see. I want to say I deserved this but I just ‚Äî I just wanted to feel good. I wanted to live,"" I said. 

The lights began to dim all around us. An all encompassing dark crept in. I knew it was death. I whispered, ""I'm sorry, all of you, I'm, I'm so sorry."""
WritingPrompts,fmynrr9,t3_fy6gwx,1586490729.0,"A smoky fog caressed the little town. Street lights decorated the horizon and cars as of this moment, were a thing of the past. This environment must be a taste of what peace feels like. Dan smelled of old cigarettes and brandy. Rachel held his arm close to her as they walked, boots clicking and sliding across the concrete. *I ought to take nightwalks more often after all is said and done.*

Dan said, ""I always told him to keep his damn mouth shut. Can't he get it? For once I don't want yelling, that's it. Just once.""

She clasped her fingers around his. *Can you feel it? Can you feel what I'm trying to mend?*

Dan said, ""He doesn't seem to get it man..he doesn't care, I know he doesn't ‚Äî shit I, I don't blame him. He can party all night I don't care. Nightmares are nothing, nothing.""

As if he were in a daze, he stripped free from Rachel's grip and lit himself a cigarette. He took a puff as they waited there by the crosswalk. Rachel examined her hand and the symbol was gone. *I thought I drew it on my hand. This is odd.*

An unnerving silence filled the air. Rachel cleared her throat, ""Wish he was more considerate of your feelings.""

""Me too."" Dan pat himself down then growled. ""I left the rest of them at home. Goddammit.""

When given the signal, Rachel led the way through the crosswalk. ""I've got some more back home. Don't worry about it it's gonna be alright."" *You're in so much pain, but I can fix it I just don't know where to heal you.*

""Yeah."" His eyes steamed with tears. With a loud sniff, he walked forward with her. ""I just ‚Äî I wished he'd get it, wish they'd all get it. I feel like I'm right there, constantly. I feel like I'm back there again all the time, hearing them yell. Telling me how worthless I am. How they should kill me right then and there, I feel like I'm right there again. I'm tired of it, the nightmares, I can't do anything. The tiniest things just‚Äî"" With his hands shaking, he dropped his cigarette. ""Shit. Sorry for dragging you out here. This your house?""

""Yes."" She gazed upon him, as if she were going to plead. ""I'm still your friend, deep down. Even if its been years.""

Dan nodded with his own gaze towards the floor. ""Won't bother you any more. Thanks for the night walk.""

As he began to walk away, fear crept in. *No no no ‚Äî not like this. I was gonna heal you not let you drown in this. If I tell him what I can do, he'll think I'm crazy. Maybe I am crazy. Maybe this power was a fluke. No, I have to try. I have to.* ""Wait.""

Dan turned to her. Rachel took out a sharpie and engraved the symbol onto her palm. She placed it on his chest, right where his heart should be. ""I can't imagine what it's like to be you right now. I can't. But, I don't look down on you, I don't see just another victim. I see an old friend I haven't seen in a long time. My friend suffering more than anyone else I've ever met.""

Dan said nothing. He bowed his head down.

""Stay with me, tonight. I'll make sure you're safe, I'll make sure you're sound. I promise.""

It was always animals, cats dogs and the lot of them. She could heal them, but people had scars that she couldn't see. We all do. And in that final act of desperation, she felt his heart beating against that life force in her hand. Beating proudly. Beating without remorse. Beating for something more.

Dan simply looked at her, and through the pain stricken face, as if some glimmer of hope fell from the heavens upon him ‚Äî he smiled."
