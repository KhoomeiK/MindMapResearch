BPD,fpwi6ow,t1_fpvmafz,1588963883.0,yes! i have an instagram spam account with a few of my close friends where i just post and post. i end up going through them all a little later and deleting them because it makes me feel so guilty and unreasonable and crazy. i hate it too. i hope we all get thru this :(
BPD,fpwhtf2,t1_fpw655a,1588963698.0,"i understand what you mean. for me posting anonymously on reddit isn’t the same as just unleashing all my thoughts on my friends. usually they don’t care and honestly i’m fine with it because i feel like i’m overstepping anyway. i feel so much regret after putting all of it on my friends, so it does help posting here especially when there’s a whole sub for it with people who share the same experiences"
BPD,fpuw5e8,t1_fpuvzmq,1588925803.0,that’s pretty the same for me but its not the only thing weighing in. i just get kinda tired of people. i’ve been through a bunch of therapists for 10 years since i was 8 but it hasn’t really done much for me. thank you :)
BPD,fpuur4d,t1_fpuujas,1588924399.0,"yep. both for me. it’s more romantic relationships i struggle with though. i have a few friends who i’ve been friends with either my whole life or for a few years because everyone else i just feel like isn’t on the level i’m on i guess?. even with them i find myself ignoring them and ditching plans with them. i don’t mean to i don’t know why i do it. i’m also too scared to start any type of relationship with someone new, or if i try to, i don’t wanna be bothered by them. but i hope you get through this :("

BPD,fnhhb6k,t3_g1ncbb,1586962397.0,"all the time. when i have massive lows and try to unload on one of my FPs (i have 2) the only type of responses i’ll get it “same” “feel that” “relatable”. and it pisses me off SO. MUCH. i know this person super well and she has no sort of mental health issues. she tells me she’s sad sometimes which makes her depressed but she’s always out doing something and enjoying life and it just makes me think she’s saying that to be relatable. but being “relatable” is not cool. i just wanna unleash my feelings but when i get “same here!” or “i feeeel” it just makes me want to go on a 12 page rant aboit how they couldn’t possibly understand what’s happening and to not act like it, bc it’s not quirky or fun. thank you for your post i thought this was only me <3"

SpiritedAway,fmwkfpo,t3_fxu7sz,1586448172.0,"for me, i’ve been watching this movie for 17 years. i’m 18, and my mom used to put it on for me almost every day since i can remember. i moved when i was about 10 and lost the movie, and found it online at about 14 and watched it for the first time in years. i cried for like 4 hours. it’s the nostalgia and the deep meaning to the movie, it just touches your soul in a way no other movie could. every person i’ve recommended it to has told me they also cried after/during watching it. it’s an emotional movie :’)"

MDMA,fl3kn4y,t3_fmdbdz,1584788420.0,"i’m a 5’4 F 112lb-i do struggle with depression, anxiety and ptsd- but since the quarantine i’ve been in a good headspace,, got this today from a trusted coworker. i had wendy’s at about 230pm and a good amount of ice cream about an hour prior to taking this. i had anxiety about taking it so i cut it and took half at about 10:50. went for a walk to destress myself. got home and decided ya kno... go big or go home and took the other half about 25 minutes later. i cleaned my room moved it around a bit to pass time and it took about 3 1/2 hours for me to feel anything at all. the most i got from it was that music sounded more pleasurable and god the cotton mouth was REAL. i didn’t feel much of a euphoric vibe, just more chilled out. the affects were VERY minimal. i look in the mirror and my pupils are pretty dilated. now it’s about 7am and i’m trying to eat but even the thought of food makes me wanna vomit & i have a terrible headache. my pupils are still a little dilated, larger than normal. why didn’t i feel anything? i know i should’ve tested it, mistake on my part but i figured i’m getting it from a trustworthy person who i’ve bought from for years, and didn’t have a testing kit. i didn’t have a bad time but i was a little disappointed. this also happens to me with lsd sometimes. takes me way longer than my friends to actually start tripping, and while they were out of this dimension, i just thought everything looked cool. any insight ?"
askdrugs,fl3c7tz,t1_fl38uhm,1584777186.0,"that makes sense. i’m a lil mad at myself for being a bitch abt it and not downing the whole thing lol. thank you for the insight doe, i appreciate it lots :)"

dpdr,fl01a4b,t3_flksad,1584687501.0,this has also happened to me while driving. i was in the passenger seat halfway into a 2 hour drive. i was looking ahead at the highway and the trees and all of a sudden dark thoughts and energy hit me like a truck. the steady driving and the long roads triggered all these thoughts that life was a fake made up thing and everything around me was set up. i looked down at myself and thought i wasn’t a real person and nothing around me was real. i started internally panicking and couldn’t speak or move for about 20 min. it was like i was trapped in my own head but disconnected from my whole body. i was eating chicken nuggets we got at wendy’s prior and when i looked down at it the half bitten white meat terrified the shit out of me. just looking at it i was like .... “wtf am i eating what is this” and instantly spit it out out of horror. my cousin who was driving was talking to me most of the time just rambling and i couldn’t comprehend any of it at all. i think maybe music also had something to do with it. i’ve found that certain songs make me dissociate. only way i got out of it was by building up a scream to bring me back to reality and then telling her what just happened. instantly went to sleep after that. too afraid that if i looked around after that it would happen again. hugs to you and hope you get thru this <3

Dissociation,fkei8c9,t1_fkegabg,1584113723.0,"that sounds a bit like psychosis , but i’ve had an experience where i was once driving, and i was kinda zoning out before i started and ended getting really lost in it. and then at some point i dissociated só hard i stopped feeling my body and it felt like someone else was moving my body like it was theirs and i was watching it from inside my head in a really dark white room. and i was thinking this is what it was like to be on auto pilot. i could walk around in my own head in that room and when someone tried to talk to me i couldn’t talk or laugh or make any sounds. definitely talk to a professional about it or make a post about it. i’m sure someone has definitely experienced something similar"

Depersonalization,fjo8ot7,t3_feijnt,1583522802.0,this happens to me all the time. when i was about 8 i was forced to leave my hometown in the middle of the night without saying good bye to anyone in my life. sometimes i’ll get a little flashback of memories and their faces but it kills me because i can’t really remember any of my childhood then

raisedbynarcissists,fjc2q73,t1_fjbpif0,1583207104.0,"thank you so much! i know reporting her would be the right thing but ive grown so close with her the past few years and she’s such a good person who just happened to do a shitty thing and messed up a good relationship with her patient,,and i just don’t think i could find myself doing that :(."
raisedbynarcissists,fjbgxv1,t3_fcieto,1583193034.0,thank you so much for this. it’s so frustrating trying to open up to people about family issues and they say “well that’s your mom that’s your family”. this is beautiful
creepyencounters,fj9ne08,t3_fc3fsq,1583154459.0,"this happened to me and my friends when i was about 8. i lived in this little community of apartments and he lived on the far side away from us ... he would pull up in his van with a camera and take pictures of me and my friends who were no older than 12. went on for a while until one of their moms saw and came up and screamed her head off at him. all he did was continuously take pictures of her too and drove off. was reported to the police but heard nothing back. not sure if anything happened, we moved just a little bit after the incident"
Dissociation,fijyhki,t1_fijk9v4,1582468028.0,"yoga is very intense. i was diagnosed with severe depression anxiety and ptsd a while back and found that too much yoga actually makes things a lot worse. for me once a week or even less is all i can do. i like doing small amounts of meditation somewhat regularly but it’s hard to keep up with, seeing how i’m usually too depressed to even get out of bed some days. i usually plop in some headphones and use music as my escape while painting but more recently i’ve found myself even giving that up and just being able to stick to music, which does help a lot i think. it gives my brain something to focus on while also pleasing it, i guess is the best way to put it. i wish you well on your journey with this xx"
Dissociation,fijy4si,t1_fijnyh7,1582467734.0,"you replying with your experiences alone really helps. thank you so much. i’m also very sorry for your loss. i completely understand the lack of emotional responses. there are time where i wish i could cry to let some of the pressure out but can’t find it anywhere in me to do so. i’m praying things don’t get worse for me or for you, and only get better from here. this is such a struggle and nobody in my real life seems to understand. it just feels good to talk about it with people who have similar experiences, so thank you"
Dissociation,fict2dv,t1_fi9ra59,1582356249.0,acid for me did worsen my problems!!!! i had a terrible first trip because i had the worst babysitters. i ended up in my woods by myself for an hour at 3am and it fucked with me heavily. it destroyed my current coping mechanisms and opened up my mental problems. i did do it several times by myself and had all good trips.  shrooms is probably the way to go if you want to keep doing psychedelics. nothing but good experiences!!! did you experience these episodes after doing acid? if so that may be the problem. it is for most people because it really opens up past wounds
Dissociation,fi8so2a,t1_fi8ncrh,1582247434.0,"yes definitely, i’d stay away from most sativa strains. there’s a lot of websites that tell you exactly what strains to stay away from and what strains will be your bestfriend with these experiences. just do some research and find what you think will work best for you. where are you from ?"
Dissociation,fi6af6i,t3_f6kcxp,1582185356.0,"this happened to me too. i used to smoke on the regular and loved it, i’d have great highs where it actually helped so much with my anxiety and depression, but after having a dissociative episode leading to a very bad high..it’s completely ruined smoking weed for me. you’re probably in a very vulnerable state after that happened & weed amplifies it. i also think that since that one incident happened , you start to think yourself into that feeling. i suggest staying away from sativa strains & only smoking indica, also try some cbd products! there’s this cbd soda that’s super cheap you can get it at any liquor store. i always take some w me when i want to smoke with my friend group and it doesn’t necessarily completely stop that bad feeling , but it helps w the anxiety...and cotton mouth too lol. it’s a struggle and quitting smoking is just not an option for me ... if you ever want to talk you can message me"

dpdr,fgj4mwz,t1_fgilrp4,1580836902.0,i haven’t really been able to talk about my problems because i suppressed them so much and stuffed them in a tiny box  in the back of my head. we just now started really getting to the root of my problems after having these recent episodes and realizations. at first my therapist was mandated due to being hospitalized and i was against it for a while. i didn’t want help because i thought i was fine and didn’t need professional help becahse i had seen a therapist since i was a child. but i started to keep up with it. but i’m definitely gonna try the yoga i think that’ll really help me. thank you
