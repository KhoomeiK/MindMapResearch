Providing there wasnt abuse or danger in the relationship i cant say its a bad idea to get back with an ex, just need to be careful because chances are things that casued the break up in the first place will show again.

Everyone grew their own food and made money by making things and selling hand to hand, proper community. People in their 80s still looking 50 due to clean air and good living. Leaving that and coming back to the council estate and 12 hour shifts killed me. I only work to save up enough to leave.
