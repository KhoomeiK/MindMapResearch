Paranormal,fqbmc9y,t3_ghpzjq,1589239687.0,"Yes! I had a reading done awhile ago over the phone from a psychic. An old childhood best friend came through for me and told me that I needed to be positive and I can do this. She told me that death wasn’t real and that if I ever feel a brush or something It’s her. Whenever I hear a certain Taylor Swift song I think of her, nobody knows that but the psychic mentioned Taylor swift. 
I’ve got many signs from her since then. I always close my door when I sleep and I’ve woken up with it wide open. No window open, or anything. One time I was talking about her to my best friend and I picked up a candle that said “forever young” she died at 19. I didn’t look or touch any others but that one. The next day at work? I hear “forever young” on the radio. I believe she’s here with me. The psychic asked me “do you write poems?” I never tell anyone that I do, I said “yes I do!” “She reads them”. I got chills."

We were childhood best friends and grew apart as time went on but we had a class together in school and would smile at each other often. She asked my brother about me once and how I was doing and I always regretted not talking to her. When I was in college I found out that she was killed in a car accident. She slid on black ice coming home for a Christmas concert to see her mom. I went to her funeral and I never got that image out of my brain of her laying there. It was an open casket and her neck was puffed out (I think it was broken). After that and years later it still affects me.
I dream of her often and I never forget her. I went to a psychic recently and she came forward and told me to “be positive” and that “death wasn’t real”. I get signs from her all the time. I was talking about her once to a friend and I picked up a candle that read “forever young” she died at 19 years old."
