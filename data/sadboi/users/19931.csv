When I first went to hospital I was in beds near some people who had tested positive several weeks ago and others unconfirmed (I ended up testing negative as expected) whilst staying on one ward all patients had to keep masks on all the time even whilst sleeping. All the staff wore the basic PPE (paper surgical mask, gloves and sometimes aprons although the food staff always wore aprons). When moved to a cold zone ward (confirmed not to have covid) I was allowed to remove my mask but staff still kept theirs on.

Two weeks later I had to go back to hospital and as I had tested negative previously they sent me straight to the cold zone. They did test me again and once again I was negative. In the cold zone although I didn't have to wear a mask all staff wore paper surgical masks (I think some staff wore slightly fancier masks and that might have been to do with their risk level with pre existing conditions but I can't confirm).

My legs have not given out from under me ever but now they have done so at least 3 times).

I know things are kind of crazy at the moment so that might affect things but it felt like everyone knew what was happening with me before I did.

At one point there was suddenly a porter with a chair next to my bed and they were saying it's time for me to transfer wards (this was the first I was hearing about it). Also later on the other ward my dad (I'm 20 btw) called to see if he could drop off some of my belongings and he found out I was moving wards again (I only knew because they had the phone call right outside my bay). Both times I had to ask why I had been moved to the nurses at the new ward. It was somewhat ridiculous.

Also something that still bugs me from the other year was when they did an ecg the doctor didn't say anything but he had a reaction I can't quite describe so I asked him if it was bad and he just said he had to go talk to his colleague. I would have much rather he said something like ""one of the measurements looks slightly off but I'm just going to discuss it with my colleague"" (just acknowledged that something might have been wrong). He may well have come back and told me about it but I had a seizure shortly after and have very little memory of that day.

I think too many people are skeptical of googling symptoms. It can really help. When I first thought I had anxiety I researched it online and then waited some time before going to the GP and saying this is happening I was wondering if I might have anxiety and she sign posted me to the mental health services and I eventually got diagnosed.

I also googled my symptoms once when I had tonsillitis and went through a very long list of possible illnesses deciding that tonsillitis matched my symptoms most so I went to the GP and got them to check it out and yeah I did have tonsillitis.

I think the key is to be very critical. So if I have 2 out of 20 possible symptoms it's unlikely I have that especially if those two symptoms are very common in illnesses. Whereas if I have 11 out of 20 it's more likely and then I would probably raise my concerns to my GP.

I also make sure not to say ""i have this"" until I actually see a doctor to confirm or deny my hypothesis. I just say ""i feel like this"" or ""i might have this"" to those closest to me who might notice something is wrong.

Anyway sorry if this reply is out of place. I hope things go well for you and you and your doctors are able to work out whats going on :)"

The GP called me back and said she discussed it with the team and since it's only been two days it's unlikely to be POTS and it's just anxiety. Whilst waiting for the call I jogged up the stairs and realised it was a mistake as I plummeted like a plank to the ground. I asked her if that was normal and she paused and said it was probably just from the overdose. She said I'll still feel like this for a few more days (lies-mild cases like mine only have symptoms for 6-24 hours) and I agreed to let her contact a psychiatrist (she got my hopes up by saying specialist at first).

You know I was also kind of confused and concerned about the fact they couldn't find any charcoal anywhere and slightly disappointed because although they said it would be awful I was interested in trying it.

Hospital is definitely weird at the minute. It sounds like they're run off their feet with covid patients but people going in with other health problems or accidents are low. Upon my leaving the dr said that if I had certain symptoms to come back because they have a low threshold for what gets admitted.
I also stayed in cold zones because two weeks ago I was tested for covid19 and it was negative (hot zones are for those with covid) however I also got tested again. Everyone going in to the ED has to get tested so even though I told them, I was tested again (and unsuprisingly it was negative). I feel kind of bad about that part because I feel that test was wasted when others can't get one. Also it's awful like someones trying to mumify you and they are taking your brain out through your nose.

Also no worries about it tasting bad on the way back up. It actually had the same taste which clung to my mouth for ages. I guess it serves me right lol. And seriously, thank you, your words mean so much and definitely helped me seek help."
SuicideWatch,fq43yh2,t1_fq3bef0,1589073356.0,"It tastes just as shit coming back up and it's lingering. In the end I told my mum whom I live with and she told me I needed an ambulance. Also really wishing I hadn't eaten rice for dinner. (Weirdly some of it was blue).
Drs are now searching for charcoal but the emergency department doesn't have any lmao"
diabetes_t1,fq3bdrn,t1_fq2w1us,1589064770.0,tahts the funniest. I don't know why I didn't think of that b4
SuicideWatch,fq39y47,t1_fq394e8,1589064378.0,Shit sorry dude. It 100% would taste better coming back up lmao. I've kinda stopped downing it and the pills now. I dunno if I can just sleep it off because i don't want to go to hospital. I really hate hospital.
nhs,fq3927n,t3_ggp88b,1589064142.0,"I'm a patient but the other week I was in hospital for non COVID reasons (i tested negatively actully because everyone in a&e gets tested. All the wards were decreased in size to try and separate patients more so where there would normally be 6 patients there were 4 with the middle spaces empty. Also we had to keep our masks on at all times even sleeping until I got sent to a cold zone (people confirmed negative). Some of the staff seemed stressed but loads of them were super nice and friendly still.

I also found it pretty scary and lonely although they didn't give me my antidepressants so that would affect my view of things slightly."
13ReasonsWhy,fq12jub,t3_gg9n8n,1589040894.0,"I think he did know her. It's normal to not know everything about a person. My parents don't know everything about me, I'm not sure my best friend whom i've known since i was a baby knows everything about me either. Hell I'm always discovering new things about myself but I still know myself."

AskReddit,fpxgyqg,t3_gfqzac,1588982458.0,"At my uni flat they tested our fire alarms every monday 6pmish. One day it's like 4pm, I'm still in my pjs, lying in bed when the fire alarm starts going. I expect it to stop in a couple seconds but it doesn't. That's when I realise it's not a monday and it's not 6pm so I'm like wth? Do I actually have to leave? Is the flat burning down? So I quickly get changed and just as I head out my room it stops.

Turns out my flatmate just burnt some bacon lmao. So it was a false alarm but not a drill."

diabetes,fpsftzm,t1_fpse27f,1588872757.0,I've gone to the hospital before for harming myself and fear of harming myself. What happens is they call 111 (the non emergency phone number which you can call yourself) for you and select the mental health crisis option and then you speak to someone from the first response team who tells you to go to your GP. The GP refers you to the mental health services and then you have to wait months to hear from them. I've worked so hard for this counselling and I know it's all I'm going to get.

diabetes,fpsdjrt,t1_fpry0uo,1588871657.0,I'm starting therapy soon. I'm trying to tell myself 6 sessions is better than nothing and at least the NHS is free. It just hurts that it's taken about 5 months to get it.
diabetes,fpsclq0,t1_fprqljg,1588871201.0,"I'm trying to get therapy. I'm in the process. Actually have been since december/ january but have had fun experiences of being turned down and ""overlooked"". But yeah finally seem to be getting somewhere in the system.

Everytime I hurt myself I regret it afterwards but then the urges come back and it's so hard to fight especially today. Today is 5 months from some trauma and it's also about 10 years of suicidal thoughts.

When I start therapy I'm definitely going to talk to them about everything but in the months when I haven't had therapy posting on reddit has kept me going because I am too afraid to talk to family about everything."
selfharm,fppj85i,t1_fppiswh,1588803280.0,Yep it could lead to a coma and in the most extreme cases death.
diabetes_t1,fpi8p93,t1_fphn56q,1588635895.0,Thanks. I live with my parents. I hadn't thought about having them check my doses before so that could be good. The hard part would definitely be explaining why as I don't like to worry them especially when there's not much they can do but I might give it a go.
diabetes_t1,fpi8fol,t1_fphcysg,1588635744.0,I should be starting therapy soon which is kind of a relief. Hopefully I'll get my antidepressants back soon too.
diabetes_t1,fpi84ic,t1_fphmolr,1588635568.0,Yeah I have glucagon and my parents know how to use it although I haven't actually needed it before. thanks
diabetes_t1,fpgz85s,t1_fpgv6p2,1588612151.0,My parents and friends are pretty supportive and they know about my mental health struggles. I'm pretty sure what's making it worse at the minute is that my GP hasn't sorted out my prescription for my antidepressants and so I ran out like 4 days ago (and they know). I'm supposed to be starting therapy soon too.
