college,fqsicwf,t1_fqshp3l,1589608093.0,"Most students who plan on going to medical school major in biology, at least from what I’ve seen. This will knock out all/most of the pre-requisites you need to be admitted to medical school. You’ll need to take the medical college admissions test as well. Depending on where you want to go geographically, you have many options. University of Pennsylvania, Harvard, Princeton etc are some of the Ivy League schools in the NE. University of California or University of Chicago will have a different environment obviously so it really depends on what you’re looking for. Their respective websites should have instructions for international students, like how to apply etc."
