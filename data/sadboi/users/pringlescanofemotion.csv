It is heavily romanticized and we‚Äôre seen as manic pixies, ‚Äúcrazy in bed‚Äù, a good fuck that shouldn‚Äôt be dated. Yeah, we‚Äôre paid attention to, because women have always been seen as a spectacle regardless of the context. Again, it‚Äôs different problems that the other side doesn‚Äôt understand.

As far as social punishment for real mental illness exists for everyone. Real depression is isolation, it‚Äôs people getting angry at you for not answering phone calls. It‚Äôs me hiding bipolar disorder from my ‚Äúlogical and facts driven‚Äù brother and my female friends leaving me when I was off the handle.

That‚Äôs real life, not what movies and social media shows us. Unfortunately both of those outlets have a nasty way of bending our perceptions, but it‚Äôs sucks that men can‚Äôt be vulnerable and women are to be believed as impervious.

Edit: As far as men dealing with it alone, I don‚Äôt mean literally. We should all back each other up. But, it‚Äôll take men to start their own movement that I personally think is overdue for you guys and it‚Äôs a shame that I truly feel pain over. Not all men backed women, and not all women will back men. It is what it is. Every movement that‚Äôs ever existed had pushback, that‚Äôs why its a movement to begin with"
unpopularopinion,f8yiwkv,t3_e2gfsv,1574947975.0,"Because the majority of men don‚Äôt have a strong emotional support foundations amongst each other. That‚Äôs not to say they can‚Äôt have strong friendships, but guys typically don‚Äôt handle talking about feelings well. The way women have slowly taken to ‚Äúredefining what it means to be a woman‚Äù, men need to do them same for themselves. The same way that way back when a woman dared to wear pants, men need to actively fight the status quo even if it means they have to do it alone. Men deserve to be vulnerable.

Guys have a lot of problems that need to be dealt with and it shouldn‚Äôt only rise when talking about the other gender or as a means to shut women up. We all have separate problems that the other may never understand and that‚Äôs okay.

I‚Äôm not a guy, but as a woman whose had many guy friends I was always the one they confided in when talking about their issues because as a whole we‚Äôve been socially better equipped for it. And that‚Äôs not men attempting to be vulnerable to get into my pants as some cynical 20 year old would say. I mean dudes opening up to me about their suicidal ideations because they felt uncomfortable talking about it to their male friends.

As a whole, most people don‚Äôt give a shit about whether you‚Äôre depressed or not, regardless of gender. You see it in the memes we share. Everyone jokes about being depressed and crying out into a void that only blinks back in the form upvotes and laugh reacts. We mask it as a joke, but the reality is that. It‚Äôs not solidarity, it‚Äôs not normalizing metal illness as much as people wanna say it does. A lot of people are depressed and no one cares unless the problem is either yours or close to you."

NewToEMS,esnp5ag,t3_c8lf1s,1562142738.0,"Regarding mental health, if you think you can do it then do it. I assure you most ems workers have at least some sort of problem.

I have c-ptsd and highly suspected adhd (waiting on further eval whenever I muster up the executive function to schedule my next appointment haha how ironic)

I passed medics school and I did a good job. Part I feel because I felt like I had to prove it to myself because of my mental illnesses. Remember you‚Äôre more than a diagnosis. Good luck!"

This disorder fucking sucks we all know it, and sometimes it‚Äôs triggering to hear it but help can only get you so far. You are your main resource, we all are. It‚Äôs easier for some and significantly harder for others, but that‚Äôs how it is.

Please look for help in order to help yourself"
AskAstrologers,ep2mbyb,t1_ep212hv,1559010119.0,"You are actually me jfc lol

I‚Äôm pretty good at resolving conflict, but god will I do just about anything to avoid it from happening in the first place. I stay daydreaming about the idea of being better, having better, doing better. Complaisance isn‚Äôt good, but I feel like I‚Äôm doomed to never feel content.

It really is this obsession with inner peace that paradoxically does the opposite. I‚Äôve made it a point to work on that about myself, but man is it hard."
