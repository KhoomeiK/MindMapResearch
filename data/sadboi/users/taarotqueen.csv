i’ve posted this story before at one point. so i take adderall in the morning. she takes hair vitamins, both of which come in capsules. one morning, i was sitting at the table eating breakfast and my mom was putting my meds and other supplements in my pill divider. her hair vitamins are over there as well and i’m not really sure exactly what happened until i hear a shriek and “I’M GOING CRAZY!” 

i look back and she was spitting out my vitamin D and NAC (other supplements i take in the morning) but had already swallowed one of the three pills i take in the morning. i’m sure you can guess which one it was. 

she called for my dad and started freaking out because she “took drugs” and was scared. he reassured her it would be fine, and that she wouldn’t be impaired but actually do better at work. 

i had work then and when my mom picked me up i asked how she was doing. she went on an enthusiastic tirade about how she had “the BEST workout ever” and “the BEST show ever” and that she was so motivated that she was finally going to get the kitchen knives sharpened today she’d been neglecting to do for months. she hadn’t eaten all day so then forced herself to buy a bar at whole foods. 

so yeah. my mom mixed up her hair vitamins and my adderall and proceeded to have a very productive day."

for all my danes, do y’all get financial benefits or in some tax deductions the more children you have in your country? i was thinking it could be money related, like legally adopted them, got the benefits or whatever, and then discarded them before they could really start a life and people would know their name and declare them missing."
serialkillers,fqj1mf2,t3_gi445d,1589403812.0,"i think a possible difference could be that many cases of female killers usually seem to have a motive, usually domestic (seems many of their victims are men they are dating, married to or having an affair with, or whoever she is jealous of). obviously doesn’t make their murders justified, but it seems less women just kill for thrill or the powertrip, but for revenge. most female cases i’ve heard they usually say “he cheated on me” or “he was trying to rape me”rather than actively looking for random innocent targets to lure 

this could just be due to the most popular cases, i’m not sure if it’s actually true but it could be why female serial killers don’t seem as common, they don’t seem as “mysterious” since they usually give a motive so we don’t focus on them as much making them seem like less of a percentage

i guess whenever i tend to think of female murderers i think of chicago (the musical/movie). listen to “cell block tango”, i think a good number of their killings could be for similar examples these characters expressed, just happened several times"
serialkillers,fqiw3wa,t3_giu88b,1589401681.0,"it’s entirely possible, again so many mental health conditions overlap. i’ve been “diagnosed” with like 7 different types of shit (one of them being ocd, i’m not a serial killer lol this is just an example) since i was young and i honestly don’t even know what i still “have” (pretty sure i’ve outgrown my tics, at least the noticeable ones) or what “disorder” a certain behavior stems from. honestly i’d say the majority of mentally ill people have more than one. 
 
obviously ocd in itself isn’t a disorder that usually affects things like empathy, and any type of person can have it for different things. it’s not just the stereotypical “clean freak” caricature (think emma from glee) but can also come in forms such as intrusive thoughts, which would be how these obsessive thoughts could come into play. if they have compulsions as well it might be visible if they have very specific patterns, but again, we don’t really know.

i shave my pits because i live in a very hot humid climate, and despite being very hygienic have a tendency to sweat there which can cause odors (i’m addicted to garlic, like whole cloves, maybe that’s why lol) obviously hairy =/ smelly but i work long hours on my feet all day, sweating like a mofo and with a shirt on sometimes sweat mixes with your natural biome of bacteria on your skin and that’s why body odor exists, and hair would hold onto it easier 

my best friend who is male even recently shaved his legs just for fun and said he actually loves it, he says he feels much cooler during this heat and loves how smooth it feels in general. and, imo, just as i don’t think women look more “manly” with body hair, i honestly didn’t think my friend looked any less masculine with his hairless legs, i didn’t even notice till he told me. hell, swimmers who are the some of the most fit men out there shave so they can glide along the water easier.
