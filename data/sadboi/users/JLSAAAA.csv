tretinoin,ffhhph7,t1_fffy25t,1579935728.0,Thanks for your answer. That's good to know. After posting I only found 1 study that said moisturizing didn't affect efficacy but it was about a compound called trezoine (sp?). There's so little research out there on it. But enough anecdotal research that makes the case for buffering. I did forego the buffer last night and apart from a bit of redness on the jaw (that resided very quickly) my skin looks just as good as the night before with the buffer. I'm not going to relax about it until I pass week 12. I'm worried about how  bad it's going to be. But also excited about how good it'll be after.

That sounds good, i've heard the pimples people get are the ones that were already  under the skins surface waiting to pop. I do have the dryness though. And yesterday I tried doing the treatment without the buffer underneath, but absolutely slathered my face in moisturizer on top. I experienced a bit of redness on my jawline after application. But cooled it a bit with a bag of peas and topped everything with vaseline. My skin is baby soft today. But i'm just going to stay prepared for the peelies/redness/etc"

yoga,fbebqys,t1_fbe9g51,1576782533.0,Yes most youtube practices are vinyasa. But I meant the cueing. It does sounds like he is on point and doesn‚Äôt get carried away with talking about unrelated things (which is very distracting when instructors go off a tangent)

People in my life don‚Äôt even know I do it daily. It‚Äôs just this thing for me, that no one has seen me do and it feels almost scared to me at this stage. The one thing that YouTube videos really contributed to is this feeling of learning how to trust my body and my own judgement. No one was correcting me in the beginning of course so I really had to tap in and focus/scan my body from top to toe for good alignment.

So when I got into a tripod headstand at some point I felt like it was my body rewarding me for never pushing myself too hard (I try every pose twice a practice, if it doesn‚Äôt work I let it go). Thank you so much for your book suggestion. And Yes, you‚Äôre right. I notice myself doing a freestyle flow when i‚Äôve been sitting at my desk for too long and it happens organically. 

Yoga really changed my life in more ways than I could‚Äôve anticipated and it feels empowering to know that I didn‚Äôt even need money to make that change happen. I would absolutely recommend these videos. Even if you do know how to flow, after a long day of work it‚Äôs nice to not have to think about what poses you‚Äôre doing but to just breath and get lost in your practice."

depression,f9r4jig,t1_f9r2qin,1575571158.0,"It‚Äôs exhausting right? What made me so tired years ago was the unwillingness to accept the condition. Every year I acted like depression was a surprise. When in fact it‚Äôs part of my life. I got tired of being so self absorbed too. I had an a-ha moment when I was feeling super sorry for myself because no one checked up on me and I thought: ‚ÄúHold the phone, when the hell was the last time you asked someone else how they were doing? You are so obsessed with how you feel that it never occured to  you to check in on others because you feel too entitled to have them check up on you.‚Äù 

Everything changed the moment I got honest with myself. Yeah I‚Äôm sick, i‚Äôm going to be depressed once/twice a year my entire life and it sucks. But what sucks more is obsessing about how much it sucks. You don‚Äôt have to be happy to take a step, or open a door.  Do the thing. Who cares how it feels. I really had to learn how to step outside of my body almost and live outwardly. I wouldn‚Äôt be here today if I hadn‚Äôt flipped that switch.

As soon as I feel a depression coming I make sure I get my nutrition in order, I let everyone know that it‚Äôs coming again, I don‚Äôt do too much groceries at one time so I have to go outside to get it regularly. I make sure I wake up and go to sleep at the same time.  I keep my hour long morning yoga practice going strong, I journal like a madwoman and  I just ride that terrible wave out. My depressions are less severe than they were when I was younger (before I figured out I was still In control i was bedridden for 1.5 years, shaved my head because I couldn‚Äôt brush my hair. Had to be manually put into the shower etc). It was a lot of work. But it is doable.

A depressic can function the moment they realize they‚Äôre not nearly as helpless as the disease likes to make us think we are.

I can honestly tell you that the moment you believe you have the right to feel sorry for yourself you‚Äôre giving it all the power. 

So I‚Äôm sorry, but you don‚Äôt get to feel this sorry for yourself. You need to work because depression itself might be hard. But actually functioning with depression is the hardest work you‚Äôll do. It‚Äôs recognizing non conducive thought patterns and thinking: ‚Äúloosely throwing words around like ‚Äú always‚Äù and ‚Äúnever‚Äù are not going to help make me feel less hopeless. Why am I so focussed on how I feel, why am I not helping others so I can just step out of my head for a second. Why am I so convinced I‚Äôm alone while depression is the most common mental health disability out there. ‚Äù You are still in control. You are still responsible for finding a way to make this situation workable. You are still in charge of doing the inner work.  Being passive in your depression can literally kill you. You need to be the one that says: ok, I have depression. This is part of my life. I obviously can‚Äôt live in limbo the entire time it‚Äôs here. I don‚Äôt have to be happy, I just have to keep my steering wheel straight for the duration. So I don‚Äôt have to pick up scraps of an existence when it‚Äôs over.

 I‚Äôm currently studying neuropsychology in the midst of a rough depression. I take repsonsibility for doing my schoolwork. Even if I can‚Äôt shower and my house looks a mess and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone in weeks, i just accept that that‚Äôs all i can do for now and that that‚Äôs ok. Recognizing how depression changes my thinking and how it‚Äôs a total liar has absolutely  taken the complete dullness out of the experience.. I have now reached a point in life with depression where I‚Äôm not sad. I‚Äôm just dealing with anhedonia and a bodyload that‚Äôs insane. But that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôll pass. I accept it and work with it. Depression is  quite the monster, but it‚Äôs also quite the responsive one."
depression,f8of8i0,t1_f8of5y4,1574677773.0,Yes I  know. They say the chances are small in these doses but considering you‚Äôd have to get an IV regularly I‚Äôm still kinda iffy about that too. Transcranial magnetic stimulation only has to be done once and isn‚Äôt chemical.

 I was convinced I had it when I had all the symptoms of depression without sadness. So I knew light therapy was helping (I have SAD so i do light therapy every year) to lift my spirits but it doesn‚Äôt get rid of the anhedonic aspect that normally comes with depression. I‚Äôm still considering what treatment would fit me best.

Treatment includes transcranial magnetism, vagus nerve stimulation and a ketamine IV because traditional anti depresssants don‚Äôt work for it.

It stands out because a lack of enthusiasm alone wouldn‚Äôt make people physically weaker/slower in their speech. It messes with your cognition, so your memory becomes blurred, time warps, focussing becomes harder. I can only afford to do one task a day before I have to lie down for the rest of the day. It is very strange. Especially because you‚Äôre not sad.

No thanks.‚Äù Which results in me being a hermit  obsessing over music reviews. One thing i‚Äôve learned about mental illness is that it‚Äôs a liar.  I‚Äôm sure you still look great.

So instead if keeping it in and spiralling I usually proclaim that I'm suffering from depression right now and that if people have questions I'm very willing to answer them.

depression,f3jfbqa,t3_dh27xv,1570951840.0,It‚Äôs true. I do notice that I become more and more  effici√´nt in dealing with it everytime because it‚Äôs not a stranger anymore and its visits hardly a surprise.

There is a lot of good stuff on there and my preference goes out to yoga instructors who are on the quitter side. Hope the list helps!"
yoga,euuw18u,t1_euujzkv,1564051597.0,"I checked him out, Thank you so much for this golden tip. I found that I really  enjoy his videos a lot. This really changed the game for me!"
yoga,euuvwxx,t1_euqxwf8,1564051544.0,"I did hot yoga! I like it too but since I do intermediate/advanced yoga every single  day, hot yoga doesn‚Äôt seem maintainable at that pace. Also, I‚Äôm a masters student and university is crazy expensive already so i don‚Äôt have much financial room for a yoga subscription."
yoga,euuvoo0,t1_euqff4d,1564051437.0,I usually do at least one hour intermediate/advanced vinyasa flow. If there‚Äôs not too much distraction i indeed feel the same.
yoga,euuvkgn,t1_eur39ao,1564051381.0,I liked her too! But I usually do at least one hour of intermediate/advanced yoga so her videos don‚Äôt really cater to that need. I do really love her voice and energy.
dyscalculia,etgx4hj,t1_etf3bie,1562800763.0,Exactly! I completely agree.
yoga,etezy9l,t1_etcsw8y,1562754830.0,I saw this and thought: HOW!
dyscalculia,etezxe2,t1_esx364p,1562754800.0,"Thank you so much. This message alone already helped me so much. I really do find it baffling that a a study that is completely geared towards behavior and the neurological causes for them completely oversees dyscalculia. I‚Äôm dead set on making it, even if it‚Äôs just to conduct my owh research on the condition. It is absolutely ridiculous that a straight A student doing a non math centered study is seen as incompetent because the only course they‚Äôve flunked is a statistics course"
dyscalculia,etezrmw,t1_esyvicd,1562754609.0,Sorry for my late response. Yes. They said they didn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm looking for a loophole atm
dyscalculia,esx0n2e,t1_esrnuw9,1562323663.0,"It makes me feel so powerless, like it wasn‚Äôt meant for me to be able to do things and to be succesful. An official diagnosis is so expensive for me at the moment (600 euro) so I‚Äôm saving like crazy! But I just think it‚Äôs strange that the school itself doesn‚Äôt have a way to test me in house, considering it‚Äôs supposed to be the best school for psychology in the country."
dyscalculia,esx0e6p,t1_esr6qhb,1562323552.0,"No not yet, I‚Äôm saving up for it right now as it is really expensive. As an older student I‚Äôm paying my way through school next to my normal expenses like my home so it‚Äôs quite the financial risk I took in the first place but I would like to succeed at something for s change. I‚Äôm studying psychology but statistics is s mandatory subject because we‚Äôre suppose to do our own research next year."
dyscalculia,esx0367,t1_esrqnz6,1562323420.0,Thank you for your reply. I currently do not have the money to get an official diagnoses so I‚Äôm saving up for it. I‚Äôm glad you got so much help from your uni. Once I have the 600 euros saved up for the diagnoses I will badger the school about it. I really don‚Äôt want to give up.
Drugs,esiusv4,t3_c7zzxk,1562020631.0,"I think he handled it (or well, at least the first 2.5 hours very well). Can‚Äôt wait for the trip report."
yoga,es32svw,t1_es05c9x,1561551681.0,"Awesome, thanks for your suggestions!"
yoga,eryvjz7,t1_erx7wfl,1561418608.0,"I though it would require more work, that‚Äôs why I downloaded the app but it‚Äôs pretty ok! I think you should be fine for a while. How are the boosts now? Are they more specific?"
blunderyears,ergl2re,t3_c1y57e,1560844698.0,I love this‚ù§Ô∏è
ADHD,eqjq2sl,t1_eq2nwjd,1560109423.0,"I never thought of that. That sounds totally plausible. I did find that the pomodoro technique helps me switch tasks easier but I got so tired of myself and my thoughts at some point, I started back on my meds. It is nice to know that the sky doesn‚Äôt fall without them though."
ADHD,epzbmxs,t1_epz37e1,1559662444.0,"I appreciate your concern! 

I hyperfocused on one thing for too long. So for example: I‚Äôm in university working on getting my masters and I asses what needs to be done based on my knowledge of a subject, how much i still need to learn and when the deadline is. On Dex I lost myself in the hyperdetails of one course, completely not getting around to the other ones that need just as much attention. With household chores I write a to do list before going to bed and then tend to it from the moment i wake up. I am not saying i‚Äôll stay off it forever. But I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm not amazed about how well I‚Äôm handling eveything. I think the meds played a huge role in me not knowing how much I could attribute to them and how much I could attribute to myself. I hope that makes sense."

rupaulsdragrace,epszuwq,t3_bvruzy,1559476001.0,It is quite beautiful to see how happy people can be for someone else.
rupaulsdragrace,ep1wkio,t3_btne4n,1558997792.0,My God this is cute. Never bought a coloring book in my life but I‚Äôm ordering this one when i have money.
