relationship_advice,fpuxtxb,t3_gfpblu,1588927548.0,"Info: how bad was the original falling out? If it was just a spat, okay, I see where you are coming from for sure. But if it was something you did that was very hurtful originally or something? (I only say that because it seemed that you had to beg for the friendship back, correct me if I read it wrong. It sounds like the first falling out had a major impact. If it was a massive betrayal or something on one side, then it may just have to be mourned and let go. 
If she is a true friend she shouldn’t be acting the way she is. I’m sorry you are going through this. I recently cut off a friend of 14 years, but, it was a massive betrayal that caused it. Anything else and I would have never let her go"

AmItheAsshole,fpu8x4w,t1_fpu3ejp,1588907253.0,Hell yes. Perfect response.
AmItheAsshole,fpu8hz6,t3_gfk799,1588906985.0,"NTA. You seem to have a bit of a guilty conscious about it but I don’t think that you should. Some people are very open and honest about their transition and that’s great! On the other hand, some don’t want to constantly have to be reminded of a time they were in a body they did not feel themselves in. There are plenty of artists out there, especially my alt/emo favorites from high school, that have male vocalists that sound feminine.. I know I never thought anything of it. Having a question that personal asked from a stranger.. probably putting you on the spot as well..no. Please don’t feel guilty about that lie. You’re male, and you choose to share your transition story with who you choose to share it with. Don’t feel as though you owe your fans or anyone for that matter something, not only extremely personal, but related to your body. You bring music into their lives that they love and relate to and that’s all that matters. 

Honestly, some might disagree, but I think we should ALL remember that we really don’t owe anyone anything (as long as it doesn’t involve them). It’s strange to me that society is so open about asking uncomfortable questions or expecting explanations for things that have nothing to do with them. No one is entitled to know things about you, especially your personal life. You don’t have to give an explanation for any  for your choices. You do what you want to do with your life and be confident in it."

AmItheAsshole,fp4y8cd,t3_gbb19z,1588310598.0,"NTA. Your wife is being extremely stubborn and is trying to withhold her children (who are clearly interested) from their culture and a very helpful skill. There is absolutely no reason that she should be against this. If she feels so left out, why not try and learn some as well, including teaching the youngest so that you will all not only have a a second language, but something fun and bonding to do together! Not trying to be harsh, I just find this a bit ridiculous. Why would anyone not want their children to learn something as positive as a second language from their culture?"
