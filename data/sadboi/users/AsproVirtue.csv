plantclinic,fr37rz3,t3_gmeslt,1589851668.0,"Hello! I recently planted some cat grass to treat my baby. I planted them both on the same day and have given them the same treatment. I've placed them right next to each other in a sunny area and followed the directions that came with the planting kit. 
As you can see, one of them isn't really growing. I think the only difference is that one had more dirt coverage over the seeds. I cant remember which one. I just tried to put some more dirt over them today (the seeds didnt have very much coverage at all). I really have no idea what I'm doing so I'd like some help haha. 
Thanks!"

Yes, unsweetened coffee is definitely an acquired taste. When I had to drink my coffee black to get through the day, I eventually got used to it and even enjoyed it.

AskReddit,fb072p8,t3_eauhhu,1576423265.0,"Everyone's battle seems so much harder than mine.
I'm just another depressed person out there, but it's not like I'm starving every day or suffering from a deadly illness. I have friends around me that are the same, but as hard as I've tried I can't help. They dont want my help. No matter what I say or how many people I refer them to they don't answer. How do I respond to that? 
I want to help because I know how it feels. I can't really help myself, so might as well spend that energy on someone else right? I can't afford therapy or meds, but I can help the ones who can. Except they won't go to a doctor. They won't go to a counselor. Or a psychologist.
Why, if you keep talking about how depressed you are, do you do nothing to help yourself? Do you really want to keep suffering? 
Your condition doesn't just affect you. It affects the people around you.  I'll get treated as soon as I can, and maybe with new light I'll be able to help those around me more. 
Let's hope that's the case."

IWantOut,euk7vyc,t3_cgrrv3,1563884591.0,"I have 0 resources and I don't live in Australia or Canada, but manual labor (ex: construction) are generally decent paying jobs that anyone with some good muscles can do.

Edit because everything slips my mind: 99% of jobs will have you apply online, so check sites out. Put out a resume of anything you've done previously. (Baby sitting, pet sitting, etc.) *I live in the US, by the way.* 
Also, education in Mexico is very cheap so if you can save up and get a degree on something of your interest, I'd try there. But be warned-- you should research whether or not the US/Canada/Australia will actually acknowledge your degree. 

I wish you the best."
