curlyhair,fq8wkgj,t3_ghbn36,1589177648.0,"I have a huge forehead and really curly hair. My forehead has always been a big insecurity for me and I put off getting bangs for the longest time because people always said that curly hair and bangs don’t mix, but they were so wrong. I snapped and cut my own bangs last week and I couldn’t be happier with the results. They’re super cute, you just have to cut them in a way that’s flattering for your face and hair type. I can give you advice if you’re interested, although I’m no expert. I was really inspired by Zendaya’s curly bangs. They’re so cute! If bangs aren’t completely off the table for you, maybe getting them could help with some if you’d insecurity about your forehead."

unpopularopinion,fpwi40b,t3_gdyxes,1588963846.0,"Hating men and/ or white people doesn’t make you progressive.

My twitter is constantly flooded with women who publicly state how much they hate men, yet they continue to go on dates with them. I can see where they’re coming from on some topics such as issues of rape and sexual assault, but you shouldn’t ever demonize an entire group based on the actions of some of its members. Same goes for people incessantly hating on white people. There is a difference between racist white people, and white people who are minding their own business. The funny thing is, half of the time it’s white people making fun of their own race to get “good boy points” as I like to call it. You shouldn’t be eternally guilty for being born white, or a man. You should however, recognize your privilege and do your best to empathize and stand up for minority groups, but you shouldn’t have internalized self hatred or guilt for factors outside of your control. Generalizing groups isn’t progressive, it’s perpetuating the cycle of hatred based on our differences. We’re never going to improve as a human race if we continue to point fingers and place blame."

I think mine has to do with a mixture of body dysmorphia and gender identity insecurity. I go from extreme vanity to extreme insecurity. I’m never in the middle. As for gender identity stuff, I feel you. You shouldn’t pressure yourself to put a label on it yet of you’re unsure though. Gender is a spectrum. You don’t need to have it all figured out."

It’s called “splitting.” For me, it happens when I get really close to someone and all of a sudden I just want nothing to do with them and I ice them out. I now recognize that it’s a defense mechanism to protect myself from being too vulnerable or codependent on someone. It’s so hard to differentiate between my perception and reality at times.
