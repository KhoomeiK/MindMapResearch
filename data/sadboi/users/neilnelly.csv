I have heard of some jobs being quota-based, so there could be some stress there. The work offers little chance for socializing, so that could be good for you if you are afraid of socializing."

NEET,fbi77v2,t3_edejiv,1576892757.0,"NEETdom comes naturally to me. I have autism and interacting in society can be a challenge for me. I do worry about the future of my parents but I worry because I love them, not because I won’t get support. I am always willing to get a low stress job like a security guard but right now I am content with being a NEET. The one advantage I have over some NEETs here is that I qualify for disability and that takes away my worries more. Most importantly, I care too much about my parents to worry about what’s going to happen to me."

NEET,fa8uhyp,t3_e8159t,1575855020.0,Working does not have to be a terrible world. You can get by doing something easy - like working as a security guard.
NEET,fa1rtq8,t3_e7mjl6,1575773573.0,"Hello. I feel you. It looks like to me that you need a win in the working world. Have you thought of doing something easy like a security guard? That small win could spur something bigger and your whole world can change. It is great you have a girlfriend. She can provide you comfort and support as you try to take, if necessary, small steps forward.

As for myself, I am destined to be a NEET. I have autism and a plethora of mental illnesses. I don’t think you are destined to be a NEET. You sound like a very capable person who has done many gigs. All the best."
schizoaffective,f9krn9x,t3_e5fnlp,1575406492.0,"This is a bit weird. Here it goes. What works for me is that I tell myself in my head that I’d prefer death than give into my triggers. This strategy is a trump card that minimizes the reasoning of having those triggers. For example in my case, if I am triggered in seeing a doctor on television which triggers thoughts of my horrible cousin who is a doctor, my fears become smaller because I tell myself of something that is the ultimate end which is far more significant. It puts things into perspective."

NEET,f5vmz2m,t3_dos7hg,1572493399.0,"I have a bachelors with a major in economics and minors in math, English, professional writing and psychology. Only two minors officially count in my degree but I was able to overlap courses to count for different minors. I then did another degree in teaching, which took a year. I then ended up doing a major in speech and language pathology but failed the masters portion greatly due to mental health issues. I then took community college courses in insurance and vocational rehabilitation because I had to pick up the pieces of my life after failing. All of my education was able to come together in counting as being certified to work in vocational rehabilitation which looking back was a fluke. I worked in vocational rehabilitation for four years but had a psychotic breakdown which led me to discover I have autism. So, I did the incredible. I, an autistic, managed to get through post secondary education to that extent when the odds of graduating are so low.

Anyhow, I am a NEET now because of mental heath difficulties paired with the restrictions autism has. My life is not ruined per se. I am just living life the way it has to be lived to be able to have peace. And I am happy with the life I have. It works for me."
