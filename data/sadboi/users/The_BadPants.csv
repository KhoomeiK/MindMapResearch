But that argument defeats the speculation that it does make sense for them to deal with us just as much as it defeats my position that it wouldn’t make sense.

In the context of speculation that there may be extraterrestrial creatures in dealings with our government, unless we are missing some huge piece of information and there is something very unique about us that makes our normal operations essential to these creatures, then there is absolutely no reason they would need cooperation from our government. If they can manipulate gravity, as so many supposed UFO’s appear to do as their primary mode of transportation, then just by that alone they are militarily superior to us. If a UFO manipulates gravity to move, then it is completely impervious to anything we could attack it with, bullets, missiles, nuclear blasts, not even light could penetrate a gravity field. And unless we have some way to manipulate gravity that our government is hiding from us, the a single UFO could bring the entire planet to its knees."

But even if it’s not your fault, you have to think, this isn’t like someone messing up your pizza order and giving you the wrong toppings. If someone messes up your pizza and you don’t want it, they’ll just make you a new one and the accident pizza will just get eaten by the guys in the shop or thrown away or whatever and it’s not your problem anymore. 

From reading your post, it seems like you’re looking at this situation as if it’s similar to the pizza. It is not. It is a living person, and if it gets tossed aside and sent into the foster care system it’s going to have a really shitty life. It will be unloved and likely abused until it grows up and then will have nobody to help it along when it finally goes off on its own. And I guarantee that one day this child will want to know where it came from, and it will track down your wife, and you’ll have to look that child in the eyes and say essentially, “Yeah, the lab fucked up when they made you so we didn’t want anything to do with you so we just handed you off and never thought about it again. But hey, come meet your sibling that they didn’t fuck up and we gave a life that you should have had to!” 

Now I may be going a little hard on you, but the decision you make is going to impact the life of somebody that you had a hand bringing into this world. This child did nothing wrong and knows nothing about the world, but it is about to be punished its entire life for a mistake somebody else made. I know, they shouldn’t have made this mistake, and I know this situation is extremely difficult and emotional for yo hand your wife, but this is a child’s life, a life you decided to make, and if that child grows up to live an unhappy and troubled life, then that would be a tragedy caused by you. Sometimes you have to do the right thing, even if it’s hard.

Good luck to both of you, and good luck to that kid, they need it even more. I hope you find a situation that works right for everyone involved."

If she wants to quit using marijuana and completely cut it out of her life, it’s her life. If that’s what’s best for her, then good for her.

If you use marijuana responsibly and wish to keep doing so, then good for you. People can have a healthy relationship with marijuana simultaneously lead productive lives. Just because some people use it irresponsibly or unhealthily doesn’t mean it’s inherently a bad thing and using it in a responsible way doesn’t make you feel bad.
