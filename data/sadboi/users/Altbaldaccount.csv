getting_over_it,flqeaqx,t3_fpx0mo,1585391089.0,"How I lost weight.  
First thing. I cut sugar as much as possible from my diet.  
Increased protien consumption, limited my calorie intake.  
  
Early on you'll get hunger pangs, but with time they'll go. Once you've changed your diet you won't like to eat much fried and sugary stuff.  

  
Second thing I started exercising, weight training, cardio almost 1.5 hour a day, 5 days a week.  
  
Had my cheat days, but it was not that much.  
  
Diet is major portion of weight loss.  
   
Head to intermittent fasting if you want.  
  
Loosing weight requires a change of lifestyle.  
  
But you can do it. Don't be scared. I'm sure once you lose weight you'll regain your confidence. You have entire life in front of you. Don't base your success on whether you have a girlfriend or not.  
  
Work on yourself, your confidence will increase and you'll find people attracted to you."

Vent,fkfytuu,t3_fi4am8,1584145784.0,"I understand your feeling.  
  
First thing, workin on any public dealing job, be ready to be treated like everything. Customer can be range from polite to rude. It could be their nature or something happening in life.  
  
It is escalated when going to places which aren't considered much essential or important to them.  
  
For your mom's behaviours I can understand.  
  
My mom is good, she cares about me, loves me. But do I go to her with my problems? NO!  
Do I think I can go to her with my problem, queries, question? A BIG NO!   
  
WHY?  
  
She has her own mindset and way of thinking. She has an tendency to micro manage things. She's given me freedom in doing anything I want as long as it's good in her view. Not that she'll stop me from doing something else, but then I'll be hearing so much indirect criticism about it I'll leave it alone, because I used to go to my parents for advise.  
  
Even now if I ask something, in away from home so she can't micro manage me, she'll make it a big issue.  
  
On 2 counts it has happened, I asked her something, she didn't know what to say, brushed the topic aside for the time being. After a few days she told me that she thought about it, couldn't sleep the night of talking and guess what, I am wrong. Like always.  
  
Now I just wanted to have discussion, it's a discussion on some sense, but then I'm told not to ask such things because it affects her health.  
  
As a result of such behaviour since growing up, now this, I've stopped telling them everything, especially something which will cause her to panic or stress.  
  
I don't share my problems with her, I don't share my nervousness, anxiety and anything. Not only get I don't share it with my family because the news will reach her and the cycle will start.  
  
I paint a rosy picture for them. They'll never know about any of my problems which I can hide.  
  
As long as I'm loving away, I won't tell them anything which will be a cause of anxiety for my mother unless I'm about to die. In fact I've grown to not tell about my problems to anyone, even if it makes me look unfit, weak, rude etc. I hate to make myself look weak infront of people.
  
So it's possible they're supporting but they're supporting a different life for you.  
  
Love them, or talk to them. I don't have the guts to talk but it's the best solution. If nothing changes then you have little option left.  
Shower them with love, but don't expect anything in return. Turn towards friends (offline or online) for sharing your problem.  
  
I know it's sad to feel your alone even though there are people around you who care about you in their own way.  
  
You're not a burden, you're just finding your place."

I don't know why, have been down the entire week.  
  
Moving to different town for a few months.  
  
Is it because I'll be moving away from people I know it the place I live? I doubt it.  
  
I've grown up to not be attached to anyone. I can be just as close and then vabish from their lives without any notice.  
  
I'm worried about something else. Although I've thought about the worst condition and made plans on how to adapt to it, subconsciously it's really been bugging me.  
  
The last 2 weeks have been hell. Had a cold (not coronavirus, although I wish I was diagnosed, and I became a casualty of it), then due to it wasn't as efficient as I could be. Lost time. Still I don't have enough energy as I used to few weeks earlier.  
  
Everything combined has been a shit past few weeks.  
  
I feel like binge eating chocolate and ice cream but I can't because that would affect my weight loss progress.  
  
I don't know if I fail in the thing I'm worried about, howdeep a mental hole I'll push myself into.  
  
So there's that.  
  
See ya later.
