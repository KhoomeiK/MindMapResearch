As I watched a video about dopamine detoxing it serendipitously enhanced the tought I have been carrying with me for a while , that I need to give less attention and focus more. Don't know what it was but I also started to be more calm . Didn't get overwhelmed too quickly and when I did it seemed like I had a clear vision about it , calmness and serenity included. The less I thought about things , reduced self talks and pep talks to myself and really just did what I was supposed to do , the less I was in need to do fall into destructive patterns I usually thrust myself into whenever I felt overwhelmed.
