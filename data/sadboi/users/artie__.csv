Until you can get some better help, just try to keep yourself on task. 


“Oh god they hate me.” Take a second. Think it through (or at least try) rationally. “They must be having a bad day. It’s very unlikely that it involves me, people have family, jobs...they don’t hate me. They’re having a hard time and it’s best to leave it alone.”


I suggest very, very much not letting this debilitate you. If you need some time off, take it, but I wouldn’t recommend it because it can be so bad you’ll be afraid to go back. Like, that literally ruined MY life and I’m still not where I once was. So try to see someone as soon as possible.

mentalillness,f0x23fa,t3_d6dwfh,1569019476.0,"I think I’m pretty lucky when it comes to this. Most doctors I’ve seen haven’t been so quick to dismiss me; if I have an issue, they’ll do tests just to make sure everything’s alright. It’s possible that’s in part due to my medical history (anemia, recurring pneumonia) though.


The only recently odd experience I’ve had was when I was inpatient a few months ago. 


I’d been having pain in my right upper arm/shoulder all day, and it kept me up at night from how excruciating it got. 


I was borderline crying, felt like I was going puke, and nothing I could do would help (several trips to the medicine counter, really...).


 I was pretty sure it was just a bad incident with my mother’s genetics (arthritis causing pain during storms, as it was storming outside) but because the pain was so bad, I brought it up during my daily check-in with the medical doctor (though it had subsided at this point, I believe). 


He asked me if it hurt, and I said not right then. Just that I was a bit concerned (within reason; my anxiety was very little at the moment) because it hadn’t happened on my upper arm/shoulder & that the pain had never, ever been this bad, but I wasn’t panicking. I *was* a bit concerned I’d pinched a nerve, but I insisted it wasn’t broken, because how could it be broken and feel just fine? 


He didn’t really do anything (granted, it was not afflicting me currently so there may not have been much he could have done). He didn’t really ask me anything, 


*EXCEPT*. 


“Do you want to be taken for an X-Ray?” In a way that sounded sooo fucking patronizing.
I said no. Because of several reasons, but the main one being *its not fucking broken*. 


It felt like what he was really trying to say was *”What do you want me to do about it?”*


I do try to stand up for myself, but I just let it go to let the next person come in. Luckily, it hasn’t bothered me since, but I feel like that was very unprofessional of him. Other patients had also complained of him, amongst our group, but I finally understood *why*. 


It’s one thing if he doesn’t have a way to help me (and to be professional about it) but it’s another thing if he’s asking me how to do his job. How should I know? It’s why I brought it up in the first place...


Maybe I’m just making something out of nothing, though."

I know what you’re referring to, but it boggles me that people use that word like they don’t know what it means?

I’m of the opinion that aging up minors...doesn’t feel right. And that it IS pedophilia if they’re specifically aged up to be old enough for a character that’s older than them. Most of the time, at the very least, it’s some kind of excuse to not look like a creep.

Alicia is a 14 year old child. She’s old enough to know how to act properly and too old for tantrums, but too young to be doing reckless things like going who-knows-where, and by extension likely putting herself in a place where she can be taken advantage of. 
It doesn’t matter if it’s “vacation”. 

It seems to me that she saw this as an opportunity to go off and do whatever she wanted, and she didn’t get to do that(for good reason!), and thus reacted as such. Still incredibly inappropriate for a child her age.

Her mother or father should’ve checked to see that she had enough clothes and the like. She was only your responsibility during the trip. 

It’s likely her parents are taking her account of the trip over yours. 

If I could suggest something, maybe typing up your account of her behavior during the trip and then showing it to your husband?

Will it be Anxiety-inducing acclimating to a new counselor? Yes. 

Will it be worth it? Yes.


It may take some time for you to tell them your history and for you to open up, but ultimately, it’s worth it. I also struggle with anxiety/depression, and I’ve seen about 5~ish different therapists over the past 8 years. In more recent years, my experience has helped me become more acclimated to a new setting, and a new therapist sometimes provides a nice, fresh start. I haven’t had to do this yet myself, but if you don’t like your counselor—you don’t have to go back. You can always see someone else, see how you get along, how comfortable you are with them, and if things aren’t clicking, try again. You don’t have to hash out the heavy stuff to decide you trust someone or not.

You need to speak to someone about these concerns. If you have trouble talking (I, myself, have things I cannot physically speak about) or are afraid you won’t remember, then write it down or type it up. Send an email or bring it with you to your appointment, when you’re ready.

It’s common to have memory trouble with depression. You should bring this up as well, when it’s time. 

In the interim, I’d suggest taking notes on things you want to say/talk about/that bother you. You could use a diary, write bits on scraps of paper, or even just make a note on your phone.

I’m sorry you’re having a rough time. Again, I know how social anxiety is—and sometimes you just can’t take the leap. But do this for yourself, so you can learn how to cope with it, and so you can do what you’d like to. Good luck, & if you have questions or anything feel free to DM me :)"

It's not your fault that you're having a stressful time right now, but it is ultimately on you how you handle it. If you can't take care of a cat, you shouldn't have a cat, even if you love them. If you can't keep up, Decaf might be happier and healthier somewhere else. If I had to do that to any of my kitties it'd break my heart, but...

If you're not considering that as an option, here's my advice.

* Ask your vet about protection for outdoor&indoor cats. Personally, I use Revolution, which is a monthly topical anti-parasiticide that protects against worms, fleas, heartworm, and other parasites, but ask you vet for their recommendation.
* Consider getting her chipped/getting her a personalized collar so if she gets out and gets lost, whoever finds her and takes her to a shelter will be able to contact you and return her.
* If your family keeps forgetting about the door, maybe make a nice passive-aggressive sign saying ""DO NOT LEAVE DOOR OPEN. Open the windows instead!"" or something.

Unfortunately, it made YOU look like the bad guy, and made you feel awful about it.

It's childish and manipulative. 1000% not your fault; don't feel bad about it. They didn't have to act that way, and it's incredibly unfair of them to put you in that kind of position.
