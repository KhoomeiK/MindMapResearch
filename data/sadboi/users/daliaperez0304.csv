Ive been in therapy for years and around the time i finally had enough of bottling my emotions up i had the biggest mental break down and went into psychosis. Life was never really the same. Im trying to be as patient as i can and positive. Fingers crossed these new meds work."
schizoaffective,fombelb,t3_g88nks,1587884097.0,I think about this alot. I was assaulted by an uncle almost everyday for like 7 years then was r**** very violently on my 14th birthday. I wonder if this has anything to do with why this popped up when i was 16. Im 25 now and meds are barely working. I feel so exhausted and like i wanna end my shit all the time from ptsd then add this shit on top of it. Im so tired.
schizoaffective,folal9s,t3_g7zqb5,1587858187.0,If it isnt working then id talk to the doctor. I went 2 years just trying to find meds that worked for me. Its a frustrating process but just gotta communicate what is and isnt working for you to find the right ones.

schizoaffective,f9lwsws,t3_e5sfg8,1575434135.0,I was with some friends who are all aware i have auditory hallucinations and i see shadows. So we went on a ghost tour and everything was all good till we wandered off to go look at a seprate room by ourselves all of a sudden i see a big shadow figure run across a wall and after i heard a very deep pitched growl and mumble and then i heard my friends scream and run into each other trying to flee from the room. I realized they heard it too and walked off to catch up with them. When we caught up with the rest of the tour group they asked me why i didnt get scared of what we had seen and heard i told them thats what i experience most of the time and when im fine and not in an actual psychosis it doesnt exactly startle me anymore to have hallucinatons  so i just in a sense ignored it. They all just looked at me and said “what the fuck” and i started laughing bc i kept remembering they were all so scared they ran into each other and were bumping heads and shit 😅🤣

schizoaffective,f7f1cj4,t3_dvm8s2,1573670291.0,Yeah. Medication isn’t my favorote thing in the world bc i despise feeling any type of tired or fatigue at all which is why i tried being without them but thats just what comes with these medecines.it keeps the symptoms controlled and without them i didn’t do so well after a while. Any type of stress or anxiety in the slightest triggers me.
schizoaffective,f7dl57k,t3_dvm8s2,1573620049.0,"Ive been back on antipsychotics for about 2 1/2 maybe 3 years actually. My psychiatrist thinks that with proper psychotherapy and work from me i could MAYBE live without them at some point down the line but i have a habit of relapsing without it so he thinks the safest thing is being on it for the rest of my life since it seems to be the only thing helping me live a somewhat normal life. I feel like it all depends on you, and what your experience is like."

schizoaffective,f76oqro,t3_duiv07,1573431868.0,I would suggest going and applying for benefits and they can help you find a place to stay and give you some resources. If you are currently working with a therapist or psychiatrist i would let them know about the situation as well and they can probably help. I hope things get better and you find somewhere to stay asap. Im so sorry about what is going on and ive been in a somewhat similar position.
OverwatchUniversity,f76di4k,t1_f76buw7,1573426733.0,I try to play when im good or happened to have a day where i took anxiety meds. I just mute and dont use my mic and just play off the other players moves and strategy from quick observation and positioning of the team and enemy team. Im pretty good at visualizing and anticipating the next move on both ends from playing this way. I did take a break from playing for a while but i actually decided to get back on and play with hammond bc i cant find another game that i love playing as much as OW. I played rainbow six siege for a while and their 10x worse on there so i think i can handle it now lol And honestly once you really learn hammond hes so fun to play with.
OverwatchUniversity,f76agdm,t3_duil2k,1573425735.0,I was a hammond main. I have an anxiety disorder and said goodbye to my hammond just bc people were flaming my ass for using the “fucking hamster” and my anxiety affects how i play which made it worse lol honestly toxic players will always be fucking assholes to hammond players no matter what. Not sure why. Just need someone to blame their mistakes on? It sucks.

Ughh it is a wonderful feeling to find someone who makes you feel safe. I hope you find that. I really hope you do.

schizoaffective,f6vj7ab,t1_f6viwzg,1573187823.0,I had that issue and im finally halfway over being that way. Im trying to get over someone i fell in love with over 2 years ago. They became an addiction and kind of dependency and it sucked when they left because of it. I still fiend for the feeling he gave me. Not him. Just that feeling of... not being fucking miserable and wanting to die all the time cause im so exhausted and tired all the time. First step to getting what you want is working on trauma that essentially put you in the position to be that way. I really hope things get better for you! Because i know exactly how you feel. Its fucking hard.
schizoaffective,f6v95e6,t3_dt58aa,1573179886.0,"I suffered with this for a long time. When i was 20 i was probably worse. I dealt with sexual abuse for about 15 years. Different people. Physical abuse. And a million other things it seems like. I felt alone, i was extremely suicidal and i didnt even want to live in my own body. Absue was all i knew so i had these violent wishes for myself bc i felt like that was the only way anyone would want me. I agree with having other people help. But you have to want it to get better. When you feel like this dont wait until your next session. In my experience it could be different where you get care, i express when i have these feelings and ideas but as long as they know their just thoughts and i wont put anything to action they are there to support. I get more consistant care. I go to therapy every 3 week and have group therapies to sustain me inbetween. I call my therapist when i feel like this and its been 4 years and im doing alot better. I still struggle but not as bad. Things can get better."

schizoaffective,f4jm51p,t1_f4hwayg,1571622050.0,Rn its subsiding but then i know it’s just gonna come back. I also think this way of delusional thinking is a wah of escaping the pain of loneliness.

Zoloft has really helped offset alot of the feelings that trigger any paranoia, i also suffer with ptsd and ocd.

schizoaffective,f3i4042,t3_dgygdf,1570931979.0,It brought me down off my manic episode and it triggered me a bit but bc ive personally been dealing with alot involving my mental illness and self acceptance and a big theme in the movie is arthur fleck giving in to his mental illness and becoming the joker where hes finally happy which made me feel like me not on meds makes me crazy?? Which was a dangerous thought. This sort of thinking is gone from my mind now thank god It’s a very intense film with dark themes meant to make people uncomfortable. It’ll be a diff experience for everyone. My experience wasn’t too great but i was already going thru it. Wanna see it again once im doing better so i can actually enjoy the movie.

I miss it but im trying to just accept it and learn how to live with this by taking my meds. I feel you, no one i know can relate or understand this illness and it makes me feel lonely. I went with a group of friends to watch that new movie Joker, and there was a scene that triggered me where the character is talking to a therapist i assume and he asked to i think switch or increase his meds which is what i have done often, and she says to him “you are on 7 different medications surely their doing something” and he replies something along the lines of “i just wanna feel better” and i really felt that. I just really wanna feel better :("

Im part of a different group therapy and were just trying to build some type of structure or routine cause i notice it helps. Im just hoping to find the right meds for me.
