BPD,f0ug3cm,t3_d6esmt,1568939831.0,"I do this as well. Hide behind a smile and a laugh, act like the supportive friend. Like nothing could get to me. But inside I’m taking everyone else’s shit on as well. It’s a hard life we lead."
BPD,f0ufwuy,t1_f0ubow4,1568939692.0,"I’m exactly the same! Feel like I’m just wired for self sabotage. It’s so hard to shout the little voice in my head down. Today it was telling me to jump off the balcony at work and it took me forever to calm down. Once i decided it was a bad idea, I just couldn’t shake the feeling of vertigo. Even though I was like nowhere near a window, just felt like I was so dizzy and all I could think was I’m too high up. It’s so damn hard."
BPD,f0raj29,t1_f0ra0e8,1568878333.0,Thank you.
BPDsupport,f0n3j65,t3_ctv7pm,1568759591.0,Dude I’m 25 and I lost count of how many jobs I had by the time I was 19. The longest I’ve ever worked in one place was one year and five of those months I was signed off with anxiety and stress. Everyone makes out like “oh you must be soooo unreliable” like no I’m not my brain is 💁🏻‍♀️
