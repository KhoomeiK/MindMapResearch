If you play it actively, I'd suggest saving up for the golden pets, they're expensive but you can rack up VCs quickly. Once you have a good income of VCs, invest and gild Tireless Santas, the VC cost is quite high (220) but with active gameplay, you should get by. Also, once you have finished the golden pets and have a decent amount of T-Santas, invest in the Change on Tour, max out the speed and have 4/5 passengers, you can quickly build up VCs with trips to Penny Village and overnight with Creditopolis.

Hope this helps, I'm kinda new aswell."
