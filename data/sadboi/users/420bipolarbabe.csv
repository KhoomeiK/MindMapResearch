The first time I moved into her apartment and she stopped working and let it go to shit so I had to move out. Eventually she backed homeless so I let her stay with me while she made plans to move elsewhere. It went to extreme shit early and I basically had to do a scum eviction (put her stuff on the curb and force her out). And then when she briefly got sober I let her try again to come live with me but after five months it went back to shit. 

I basically had to sit her down very firmly and I gave her a choice of going to rehab that day or leaving. She refused to go to rehab and I gave her a week to either go back to her dads or figure out a new plan and she‚Äôs now living elsewhere. 

It‚Äôs never easy but you have to set clear boundaries. I made it very clear that I care about her and will help her as much as I can but I need to put myself first and I let her know she created conditions in which I can‚Äôt be around for the sake of my own mental and physical well-being. Be honest and be clear and you have to put your foot down. Be prepared for retaliation though.
