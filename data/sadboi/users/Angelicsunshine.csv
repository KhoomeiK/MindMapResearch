ptsd,fhfhvx2,t3_f2oh0g,1581543695.0,"None of these comments have the scientific detail, so I'll add a similar but more detailed and accurate explanation.
When things that the brain perceives as life-threatening happen, adrenaline is released which tightens senses while turning off anything not needed to immediately help you get safe. Think of it this way, your brain views about to be mauled by a tiger and reliving your trauma. If you were about to be mauled by a tiger, you wouldn't need to eat or sleep until you were safe.

This works great in the short term, but the brain and body aren't meant to live like that. That amount of adrenaline for that long is detrimental to the body. The adrenaline keeps sleep from happening well or with regularity. It also keeps appetite from having a normal cycle. With sleep and appetite out of whack, it becomes harder to focus on anything other than survival (here comes more adrenaline!).

Meanwhile, in the brain, every time the trauma is aggravated (nightmares, triggers, etc.) the pathways in the brain responsible for panic responses get stronger. Think of it like a habit. If you but on both socks and then both shoes for three months, it becomes involuntary and your default way of doing it. The pathways in the brain are basically the order in which neurons fire. Let's say you're driving and you have two options, a well paved road and a path that looks like it might fit a car but definitely hasn't had any cars on it in a long time. The obvious choice is going to be the one that's easier to drive on. The brain pathways are similar. The stronger pathways are easier to use.

These neurons in these pathways essentially buff out like biceps after working out for years. So then if we zoom out a little from just neurons, there are the different parts of the brain. In the center of the brain is the limbic system which is the emotion center. There are different parts of the limbic system, the two important ones for our purposes are the amygdala and the hippocampus. The amygdala is pretty much pure emotion. The hippocampus helps to store memories based on the emotions felt, but it also helps to recall past experienced that were similar in emotion or situation. The hippocampus is the fact checker of the emotions. If you experience a situation that you had one really bad experience with be dozens of good experience with, the hippocampus will keep the amygdala from focusing on the one bad experience.

Except you don't need to make or recall good memories when you are just trying to stay alive. The neural pathways in the amygdala bulk up because of the constant survival state. The hippocampus gets under used. The amygdala swells and becomes easier to use. The hippocampus shrinks and becomes harder to use, so memory fails more often.

CBT, cognitive behavior therapy, is the intensive process of rewiring the brain to break out of the cycle. EMDR therapy takes less long, but certain co-morbidities (like dissociation) can render this useless.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I am studying psychology and have a concentration in neuroscience."
