Professors,fqvvnb8,t3_gkrh0g,1589686219.0,I was born in 96 and am technically not a millennial. At most I am either zennial or am among the oldest of generation Z. This is my third year in a PhD program. I say this because generation z are almost old enough to be grad students and some gen z students have graduated university all together. Us Gen Zers are quickly aging to and beyond young adulthood. So we are very close to having undergrad students that are even *younger* than generation Z. We are much closer to the end of generation Zs undergrad reign than we are to anything millennial related. Its shocking that millennials are still blamed for things when we are almost 2 generations removed!

On the flip side, I *did* change my expectations for the virus. Instead of the remaining 3 essays and 12 homeworks that were assigned...I allowed students to submit only one essay outline and one essay while the rest of the homework could be submitted for extra credit. I didn’t require zoom meetings and instead used class time as office hours. I was practically giving away grades for the sake of being nice and understanding

6 students showed up. But I have dozens of emails from students confused about how to tackle 1 essay. They all have outlines and annotated bibliographies btw. I don’t think they are happy with the current set up. I thought I was making things easy for them and instead ended up being vague and seeming like I didn’t care enough about the class by not having class.

I made a mistake. I should have kept the structure I had in place instead of making it more relaxed. Students would have been much happier with the bi-weekly zoom meetings, essays, and homeworks. 

I’m on twitter too & I see undergraduates complain when in reality they tend to prefer everything they seem to be against.

I have bipolar disorder I, psychotic depression, dissociative identity disorder, and PTSD from my own suicide attempt. None of that really hit till grad school. There where episodes sure but it really didn’t become chronic until I was 24/25 and in the middle of a phd.

And I haven’t even mentioned how I was self medicating with hard drugs just to have enough energy to read my email.

Could it be that your student is fairly new to all of this? It takes years to find the right combination of meds and therapy, not to mention adapting to the side effects. so young graduate students are juggling a lot. 

Again I don’t mean to pry but if you’re student is young and within the first few years of his program then there is a lot of behind the scenes adjustments. Me personally, I had to leave until I regained control but mu department was intensely unsupportive and antagonistic.

I have spoken with students who are stuck. Many are just overthinking it and don’t realize that the hard part of writing is over. A few students were not even using the outline as if it didn’t occur to them that they are free to use the blueprint they made. The essay isn’t a test, you may look at it and confer.

“yes.”

Most woman can’t climax without foreplay. Why would I skip it? And if men with adhd are skipping foreplay than you’re just assuming they are bad at sex.

There is also this thing about adhd and being “bad” at cooking. Cooking is literally knives and fire! It’s pretty exciting. Sometimes I just want to say, “you do not like cooking, your adhd probably contributes to that and that’s ok. But being a bad cook is not a universal adhd trait.”"

Besides, I’ve worked with all of my students and they’ve done enough work to make a quality paper.

I believe  you don’t BS a paper unless you’ve found a thread with which to explore and expand. And shitty paper can have some nugget of potential. And maybe I am just more willing to grade these threads and nuggets and hope that the feed back given is what students will carry with them.

If I am being honest, I will admit that the assignment prompts were made to *not* be concise, clean, and straightforward. That isn’t what writing and literature is really about.

Instead I have tried to give students a loose prompt and have focused on creating ideas and finding ways to support them. Papers range from nursing essays, to informative philosophy, to gender and race theory, and to essays about the legitimacy of rap music. My job as an instructor has been to introduce them to the schools of thoughts and dominant consensus. I’ve also tried to be there to help them reflect as all students have graded annotated bibliographies and outlines.

My prompt boiled down to, 

1) Reflect on professional 
and relevant interest. 

2)Research a chosen field of thought with intent to create an original research question. 


3.) Write a paper that addresses said question using credible sources.

That’s literally the entire prompt:


I left all of it pretty open ended because I thought students liked freedom. I want them to write whatever they want to write about. I’d even take stream of consciousness contemplation and free writes. I don’t really want to give students hard peramaters because it can be limiting. But maybe that is what students prefer. I just cant understand how to can be “stuck” when there is an infinte amount of things you can do. Especially when there are relative few consequences for risk taking given the circumstances/virus. Just write whatever you want.

But you’re right, I am thinking of just sucking it up and offering virtual conferences for everyone."

So they got the prompt on syllabus day, before the virus each student had a graded outline too. I conferenced the outlines the 1-2 weeks before spring break. So yea, at this point, every student has an annotated bibliography, an outline, and notes from our conference. I had zoom lectures for a week on how to expand the outline.

There have been times when I’ve been completely distracted the entire time but faked an orgasm at the right moment and my partner didn’t notice.

And I don’t know if this is TMI but I have a partner who enjoys sex and sexual things while doing other things. Like sex while playing video games or smoking a cigarrette. so thats pretty hot.

But I’ve had him say that it seems like I’m “somewhere else” but that just gets him excited and willing to be a bit kinkier or quirkier in order to pull me back in. 

Sometimes he will ask, “are you bored?”

 I’ll say “yea.” 

He’ll respond, “can I ************?”

I also am fond of changing positions. Ultimately, I think my distraction comes off as being cold and kind of bitchy. And that kind of turns him on. Like if I tell him to stop and turn off the ceiling fan in the other room and tell him not to start again till im done reading an article, that drives him insane. It also gives things a bit of spontinaiety b/c I never know how he is going to react. Most of the time he is pretty obedient, sometimes the exact opposite

 But both my partner and I are incredibly specific about what we want in the moment so it’s easy to follow those specifics.

Your entire argument doesn’t make any sense.

At that point, maybe it wouldn’t have been penises. Maybe it would have been cheating and I’ve been an undergrad before. Cheating on Blackboard/Moodle is easy. And it wasn’t really about the pure content either. We were using zoom so as to give everyone the opportunity to see each other and continue on as a united classroom body.

I will admit, maybe i was too optimistic about my students’ desire. But understand that the use of zoom went beyond pure instruction and materiality.

SuicideWatch,fls5eja,t3_fqr3zw,1585434723.0,"idk. it seems like a way to die but usually illness is so painful and slow. I would like to be killed but a quick death is much better than months/years of agony, dysentery, and weakness. 

Idk, maybe it b/c my mom had cancer and it left her with serious heart complications and failing kidneys. I learned pretty early in life that illness is never a dream, its a nightmare. Being tortured by illness isn’t death, its hell on earth with an expiration date and more medical bills. (Even if you refuse treatment, there are bills) If someone wanted to die, I firmly believe that a bullet to the head is much better than dying from physical illness. Trust me, suicide is much easier than many nights of chocking on spit and puke, begging for that night to be your last, only to survive until the next night and do it over and over again until only god knows when. 

Besides, depression itself is an illness. That alone is a fatal sickness and is just as deadly as any"

And education is BAD. Again, as stated in the posted, places that are not cities and suburbs do not have much supports and that includes education. So the quality schools in the US is entirely dependent on socio economic locations. Some US schools have 30-45 kids per class, roting floors and walls, textbooks that are 10-30 years old and teachers that are paid pennies. US schools don’t even have good food and most can’t even afford pencils and paper. Its really hard to make a positive claim for American education when schools can’t give students pencils and desks. And if you do manage to come out of all that still wanting to learn, the cost of higher education is hundreds of thousands of dollars. That is not very accessible. (Yea there is aid if you are poor but lots of middle class students are paying out of pocket.) So again, education is directly correlated to the social economy and there is much more lack than their is excess. I am a teacher. I’ve taught public schools, 1 year in Spain, 2 years at a university  Education is appalling. (that was a tangent)

And i am not really worried about “human-kind.” Humans will survive but the US as a sovereign nation will not. It will no longer exist. Like yea there will be people but they won’t be “American”
or civil American citizens. American will have been a fallen concept.

I hope all this is making since and sorry for going on a tangent. but..yea"
ADHD,flgrmds,t3_fopou9,1585148957.0,"Reading Fiction and reading guides, non fiction, and information are two completely different types of reading and reading experiences. One is meant to be an enjoyable experience and the other is meant to be a guide. So it would help if you changed up your reading strategy to fully the intention.

When it comes to your computer book, you need to do more than just read it. You should be learning from it and processing the info too. So try reading only 1-3 chapters a day, after reading grab a sticky note or sheet of paper and write down what the chapter said/its main points. I recommend using small sheets of paper because that forces you to prioritize the most important things. And leave your notes inside the book! That way you should never have to read that chapter again, you can just refer to the sticky note. After you finish you should ideally have already processed the info

This works for my adhd brain because it adds stimulus and turns reading into an active activity rather than a passive one.

But yea, different books require different needs. Change it up a little and take it slow."

And how did he manage to get a good job with good insurance?

My dad isn’t perfect but he also realizes that times change and he realizes that my need for insurance is his fault anyway since most of my medical needs are hereditary. And its not even that “good” of a policy. The state we live in just happens to allow insurance extensions.

I am actually a university instructor and teach 9 classes. I have zero insurance from my employer and am the equivalent of a full time worker. But as I am paid per class rather than a full time contract, I do not get insurance. *NONE* Last year, when I *did* have insurance it was extremely limited and did nothing to cover dentist and eye care. Again, it’s 2020 and most employers find anyway to limit insurance. That is how jobs work so what you did 40 years ago means nothing. You had it easy and yet still think its something to boast and preach about. And I’m 25. That being said, I do pay to use the insurance as I pay the end costs, deductibles, and co-pays but without insurance that is the difference between $2,000 and $17,000. The reason my coverage was extended because even if I *was* employed, my dad’s insurance as an engineer is worth more than most other jobs, including university ones. (I am literally making more money with this set up)

What OP did was give his own child a death sentence because insurance is literally the difference between hundreds of thousands of dollars. No pay means no treatment and healthcare is not something that can be paid off with extra jobs or coffee money, especially when your body is being broken down by literal cancer. Treatment can be $30,000 a MONTH if uninsured and thats on the cheaper side of things. Again, no payment means no treatment and death. Like? How are you not understanding that and how could you possibly compare a 100,000 *yearly* bill to LIVE to a $50 phone bill or $5 coffee. What the fuck is wrong with you and OP?"
AskAcademia,fl9vkmf,t3_fnch2q,1584970441.0,"Yes and no. depending on the school, there is a chance that they heavily rely on graduate students for cheaper labor. Just to give an example, I am an english PhD student and my department accepted 3 literature phd students and 3 linguistics phds but also 10 MAs and 12 MFAs. That is over 30 grad students for one department (40 if you include TESL)! And most of the labor is for teaching entry level, online courses, and courses for the state prisons. 

Sorry for the random story but I do want to exemplify how phd and grad programs mean labor for the department. And if there is a recession there is a chance that they would accept *more* grad students rather than hire employees or instructors.

Professors,fl93o38,t1_fl8sl1z,1584939975.0,"idk, higher education is a multi-billion dollar industry.

Universities are cycling adjuncts and hiring fewer and fewer full time and tenured professionals. The job market is not good and yea tuition is high...but lets not pretend that that money is going to educators. It isn’t.

And it’s not like a partial refund would mean that there is less pay for educators. Housing and meal plan refunds really shouldn’t interfere with teaching salaries anyway. Housing and meal plans pay for housing and meals, not instruction..

Besides, students are also upending their lives and converting rooms into professional spaces too. Maybe not in this capacity. But it’s going to be much harder to learn physics in childhood bedrooms thats been filled to the brim with left over dorm essentials or in an apartment with 4 roommates. The least the university could do is offer partial 10 week refunds for the utilities that they can no longer use"
