offmychest,fojtwjk,t3_g7sbf4,1587829301.0,"Similar story, had a little spider hidden above my sliding glass door in my parent’s basement at the time I was 14. I’d purposefully let a few gnats in once in a while and it was always right there above the door to get ‘em. By the time I was almost 16 it had grown quite a dam bit and believe me spiders scare the shit out of me when they’re big but I was attached. 

Opened the door to go outside and it must’ve been out of the wood a little bit so the wind took him and blew him outside fast! I looked around for a good hour to no luck. That was that. Did survive though and probably had a family somewhere’s hopefully, I think of it from time to time. 

Enjoy the little things"

Hummingbirds have very bright colors.I have one issue though, wasps tons of them. keep coming to the nectar and scaring off all the hummingbirds, such a problem. 

Can’t kill the wasps otherwise it gets worse; when a wasp dies it gives off a chemical smell alerting all others. Weird huh?"
