I decided to die in the nearby future and am very non emotional about it, which many people find odd.

I have no perspective for the future.

I *really* don't like talking on the phone (I have trouble understanding what people say, audio messages have much higher quality).

Going out of my home is a burden.

I don't enjoy meeting new people and don't usually go out with my own friends. When I do, my favourite place to go is the beach at night.

I like to befriend stray or wild animals. Once I rescued a very beaten up young rooster and kept him as a pet after a difficult recovery, I liked him a lot."

I noticed something about you: you seem to be too caught in your own mental cage of negativity to correctly consider solutions. You find them annoying so you recoil at the thought of doing the effort of accepting some things. I've been there too. It's terrible. It's a negative comfort zone.
