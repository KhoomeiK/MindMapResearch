DahvieVanityisaPEDO,fr2f2cm,t3_gll586,1589836165.0,"Ash Costello had a good point about this:

There is a witch hunt against people like Jayy, Jeffree and Fallon for not coming out when this was going on back then. Instead of trying to put them in a bad light for not coming out, we should encourage those people instead because now is the time to say something.

Also for Jayy, my opinion is this:

He was brought into the band at 18 and was most likely very impressionable at the time. Dahvie had full control of him every way possible including financially. Think about it, he was forced to tour while he was on the brink of having AIDS. Dahvie also denied him to not go off tour to get treatment.  

You never know why those people didn‚Äôt come out. Either they were worried for their careers, further abuse if they said anything or they were under the impression that they would break the NDA."
