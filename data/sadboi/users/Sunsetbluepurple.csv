schizophrenia,f27o6fk,t3_dc5xmp,1570042568.0,"From my POV, i feel a important challenge of schizophrenia is keeping the personality integrated and calm, thus preventing fragmentation that leads to anxiety or depression.

Anxiety, depression and dissociation being, again from my POV the main reasons one feels compelled consuming weed.

Main known active components of weed are THC and CBD, being respectively quasi-psychedelic and the other latter being anti-psychotic.

Weed can help break free and regain some form of self-feeling, but can also augment the spectrum of fragmentation/dissociation.

When one come off weed, one can be ""refreshed"", but will have also to face the withrawal of CBD anxiolityc and that can be problematic, because it can lead to a manic phase. All that is of course depending on the dose, duration, and the nature of the real life experiences during consuming (being alone, with friends, in a stressful setting, etc)

With that said, i would say a golden rule of psychedelics is knowing the level of stress you are currently in, being honest, and avoid taking it alone or with others that cause stress or in a public setting if it's a dynamic city."
gynecomastia,f03c10v,t1_f03adf5,1568351063.0,"Yes from what i gather, adipomastia is fat, and gynecomastia is gland/fibers and fat.
Yes, mine is severe i must have twice or third the amount of fat in the breast compared to your left photo. Yes, I'll need skin reduction. Thanks for all your input.
Ok, i understand the issue with removal of too much fat in gynecomastia, that creates ""craters"".
Thanks for the recommandation of the IG videos of your doctor !"
Nootropics,f037v76,t3_d3agps,1568347231.0,"I've had very good experiences with st john's wort also.

As others have said it can have significant interactions with some types of food,  medications, and notably antipsychotics medications.
Be sure to look it up to be well informed.

It notably can cause photosensibility, and it's , if i'm not mistaken, also an extra pyramidal side effect of antipsychotics.
To counter extra pyramidal side effects of antipsychotics, i had anti parkisonian prescribed (lepticur, in france).

I would talk about that to a doc if you feel photosensibility (though mine could have been caused by antipsychotics taken in the past , at a time i wasnt taking st john wort, i don't know.)"
gynecomastia,f02tlee,t3_d3f1dx,1568337938.0,"Congrats ! 

I too would be thrilled to look like that.

I have adipomastia, not gynecomastia, I'm overweight, but i especially take fat in the breasts , which sucks majorly.

I was told it's hard to lose fat and that you can't remove too much , at least at once.

How has your doc set the limit on how much he could remove through what i assume is lipposuccion ?
Has he told you if it's doable multiple times or just once ?

I'm just beginning to research on those subjects , so i guess maybe it's easily findable info.

The doc that i saw for hyperidrosis, when asked for info on fat removal in the breasts, told me to do coolsculpting because it's less invasive, no 1 month of constrictive vest, but it seems liposuccion remove more fat.

He also told me you can't do more than 2 sessions of coolscupting, because it's potentally dangerous, but didn't say why, so this is why i wonder if there should be a limit on the number of liposuccion sessions."
Hyperhidrosis,f02sjgz,t3_d3exgm,1568337284.0,"I'm no doctor of course, and i'm just beginning to educate myself on all things related to the functioning of the body as a whole....

But i wonder  if hyperidrosis stemming from nervous system over-activity (the kind i'm suffering from) is more related to inflammation of the nervous system as whole, or if it's more a matter of adrenal dysfunction.

I'm sure it's a question more complex than what  my meager knowledge has to offer, and to each person a particular case of course.

So much issues are medically considered through narrow specialities and not treated holistically..."

The fate of gladiators, prisoners/slaves, forced to fight and face danger. And if they survive, only to begin again the same cycle. Just hoping for an eventual big final win with freedom attached.

Yeah, it talked to me !"

Hyperhidrosis,eyiunk5,t3_cwuibt,1567107880.0,"That's nice to hear !
It's such a crippling condition...
Cold in the winter, dark clothes, people always making indirect comments like ""some people should take showers"" , "" some people don't put deodorant""
They have NO idea how a curse it is."
Hyperhidrosis,eyito5g,t1_eyikhlv,1567107453.0,"I don't know exactly, but my sweating happens when i'm stressed, but also just if i'm stimulated, not in a negative way. 
I always had anxiety disorders, but since a few years, my nervous system seems to be locked in hyperdrive, likely a norepinephrine issue i guess.
My Fight or flight system is actived very easily, and  the non stop dripping and socially crippling odor comes and makes everything so hard."
