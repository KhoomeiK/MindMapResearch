AmericanHorrorStory,fo9sujl,t3_g6ca8k,1587629952.0,"1. I do agree it was an amazing season and i wish lady gaga was in more than 2 seasons she did a great job. 
2. No, in my opinion but they did have a different vibe and may be too fast paced depending on what your preferences are 
3. I enjoy Billie from what I have seen from her (watched her in cult, 5 episodes into apocalypse) but I do believe her character could definitely be better this  season. You're completely right on the Leslie part though. 
4. Hell yeah, I missed her in these last few seasons 
5. Yes"

askdrugs,fo9dq7f,t3_g6c4i5,1587616736.0,"i would definitely recommend trying it, if you enjoy the feeling and don't want to smoke there is alternatives such as edibles and tinctures"

cats,fnkelmw,t3_g2a9lu,1587024152.0,i totally get it! it can definitely be a bad thing since it had correlation to underlying health issues. thank you! i love building a companionship with him and getting closer each month ðŸ¥°
cats,fnkecck,t1_fnke8fm,1587023889.0,"his previous owners fed him too many treats so he put on a few extra pounds. i brought him into the vet a week after he came into my home to make sure everything was alright with him, the veterinarian told me to put him on a diet so he can be at his goal weight. and will do! ðŸ¥°"
cats,fnke5e0,t1_fnke0cq,1587023688.0,"i thought it might take a bit because cats losing weight takes awhile too and he is currently losing weight at the moment too. and thank you! it's been a great few months with him, will be posting a few pictures of him soon"

stoners,fmuwcyd,t1_fmuw941,1586400354.0,it really is like it's one of the only negative things about bud
stoners,fmutwoi,t1_fmuth46,1586398793.0,I haven't fully started it cause I smoked last night. But my goal is to remain busy with school work and hobbies to keep myself distracted enough. And remind myself that I will get super high for 420 if I allow myself to stay away from it for a bit so my tolerance goes down.
stoners,fmursw1,t1_fmuprw8,1586397486.0,change the strain you're smoking or take a t break

depression,fk6aleg,t3_fgnp3a,1583897290.0,"Yes, I recently got a job and I'm in school but I honestly just wanna drop out and quit my job."
Acid,fjnigp9,t3_feb2p0,1583508105.0,my friend had a similar experience on shrooms but he thought he was wearing a hat and he wasn't.
depression,fj4y6da,t1_fj4xdzi,1583019731.0,yeah i feel like that would me too so its best to just avoid it
depression,fj4wdah,t1_fj4w85m,1583018473.0,"same here like i guess people might be turned off cause im a bit shy but like i just don't wanna annoy people. me too im hella insecure, avoid going to the gym, and don't drink. id try it but like i wouldn't have it be a hobby or regular thing"
depression,fj4vqcm,t1_fj4vm25,1583018032.0,"right like i honestly only stick around for my cat cause my parents aren't good with animals and he already had a rough back round so i want the rest of his life to at least be better. it's so annoying honestly like theres 7 billion people on earth yet it's hard to find friends, i feel the struggle on that one"
LSD,fhs58dq,t1_fhs55ja,1581854372.0,"gonna need to take ur advice on that one, my cat always tries to wake up at like 4 am and that's when im trying to be asleep. he's asleep now and im awake the schedules gotta get aligned"
LSD,fhs4uxb,t1_fhs4q31,1581853880.0,ayee that's a great method.
LSD,fhs3tx7,t1_fhs397n,1581852461.0,thank you! he's been really sweet tonight too so i gotta give him treats.
LSD,fhs3sdn,t1_fhs3aqn,1581852401.0,I get what you mean cause i've been there too. i wasn't mature enough to question it until middle school and then i finally put thought into it
LSD,fhryyzq,t3_f4ntd2,1581845473.0,you have the trippiest cats ever bro. cheers
LSD,fhrnr98,t1_fhrn8qe,1581831775.0,i wish i had disney+ but luckily i do have a tripping playlist for times like this om youtube.
LSD,fhrm8le,t1_fhrm4x9,1581830347.0,sounds great! i honestly think tripping alone could be better cause then you just get to do you and not have to handle other people as well. Alice in wonderland would be crazy on acid i might try to see if i can watch it
LSD,fhrlvx2,t1_fhrkdsx,1581830036.0,agreed and earbuds are great for late hours when you can't blast the music. i prefer night tripping too so that's when i'll be tripping
LSD,fhrkaxa,t1_fhrk02q,1581828659.0,those are great ideas i've been wanting to watch some music videos while tripping
LSD,fhrj0wm,t1_fhrio7w,1581827589.0,aww that's so sweet that u saved him. he seems like a great tripsitter
LSD,fhriqoi,t1_fhriolg,1581827358.0,i don't have a couch but i have a full size bed so i'll use that. thanks! music definitely is a must
LSD,fhrijei,t3_f4lh94,1581827197.0,have a great trip! ur cat is so cute
Acid,fglga9p,t3_ez4e08,1580896238.0,"1. definitely a positive mindset
2. cozy clothes for sure and have layers so you can throw something on if you're cold or remove something if you get warm. 
3. Yes because you might not be hungry while tripping. 
4. Don't smoke the first time you trip unless you want the trip to become more intense.
5. It really depends on the person but in my experience like 8 to 10 hours. 
6. Once again it depends but the comedown has always been fine for me. Like in a way it's a relief cause then I sleep good."

LSD,f93m7d7,t3_e3ib83,1575062614.0,Same I feel like its daydream or something
LSD,f93m3p3,t3_e3ibpw,1575062536.0,A forest for sure. Trees are always extremely appealing to me on acid. Plus I'd hate the weather in the desert. I don't wanna feel hot when I'm tripping
LSD,f93lwy3,t1_f93lvbu,1575062394.0,Of course. And I'd suggest he doesn't smoke weed cause it may make the trip more intense which isn't good if he is going through depression
LSD,f93l9aq,t3_e3ktmk,1575061901.0,Try to keep him positive and happy through the day. Ask him how he is before he takes either. Best to avoid a bad trip. Or wait till the depression is over
Acid,f8txcxa,t3_e21fl8,1574813614.0,listening to music and being in nature. smoking weed is always fun too
depression,f7x34a1,t1_f7x33fw,1574044978.0,Oh no I get that

depression,f7wu90t,t1_f7wu5v2,1574038213.0,"Honestly yeah, I'm scared my parents will abandon me when I get help. I feel like my friends would help but I don't wanna annoy them because they struggle with their mental illnesses as well"
depression,f7wttu3,t1_f7wtnvn,1574037902.0,You're 100% correct I'm just scared. I gotta get help though I've been struggling for years
depression,f7wte95,t1_f7wt8mv,1574037598.0,you're right I just feel as if I always disappoint them so I'm scared to make them mad or upset.

LSD,f7wtb29,t1_f7qj8fw,1574037547.0,lmfao that's a good idea
depression,f7wsvg2,t1_f7wsqf9,1574037325.0,I do online school so that is no longer an option for me. I didn't do it when I went to public school either because I was scared to make my parents mad or get put into a mental hospital if I said the wrong thing
LSD,f7q1o0a,t3_dxfehh,1573957540.0,I enjoy dropping in the nighttime more because for some reason I prefer darker colors or cool colors while tripping so the nighttime offers me tons of those
PiercingAdvice,f71uu72,t1_f71usbj,1573348650.0,Oh no I just used 8mm as an example. Most jewelry is larger than 8mm.
PiercingAdvice,f71tvk7,t3_du4ive,1573348051.0,As long as it's the right size (probably at least 8 mm) and the same gauge you're fine. Plus it's been 3 months so I'd say you're able to change it.
Stoner,f71tnix,t3_dtxumr,1573347914.0,"It was freshman year of high school. Was hanging out with my bf at the time and some friends. I was very new to carts. So I decided to say fuck it and hit it around 10 times. Got very stoned, my eyes were low. Went home and got hella munchies and made ramen and got mcdonalds. Then watched that 70s show and fell asleep. Good times."
askdrugs,f5sveoc,t1_f5sf58e,1572444141.0,For me it was like 10 hours I think.
askdrugs,f5s7nf6,t1_f5oni2r,1572415336.0,"in my personal experience, yes. I literally had to sleep on a carpeted floor with no pillow (there might have been one I don't remember) and I had to share one thin blanket with a friend and I slept like a baby. Woke up feeling very happy and cleansed as well."
askdrugs,f5nepfw,t3_do73d6,1572299333.0,in certain sets and around certain people LSD can be relaxing in a way but it depends on the person.
LSD,f431hm1,t3_dj7n47,1571337604.0,this sounds about right
LSD,f3b7sgb,t1_f3aglhh,1570803842.0,true I hate the stigma around psychedelics because people treat you different if you've told them about your experience with it.
LSD,f3b7jyd,t1_f3b1592,1570803677.0,yeah I've heard about that a bit. I've heard it's rare though?
LSD,f3af313,t3_dg9vyc,1570770713.0,don't do it man
LSD,f3aeyui,t1_f3aesor,1570770585.0,oh I did. I told her it's not addictive and I space out my trips so I'm safe about it
LSD,f3aeotm,t1_f3aemsz,1570770288.0,lmfaoo that's what I was thinking. I kinda get it because they have addicts in their family but acid isn't a drug you take to escape your problems and it's not addictive either.
LSD,f39jnrp,t3_dg43su,1570749238.0,this is really impressive I've been drawing on and off for 10 years and I still suck at hands
