You are getting into pointless debates in comment responses which shows insecurity.

Why do you not specify more regarding your question rather than just giving us a biography?

What are you currently doing to meet a partner? 

Why do you care so bloody much about what other people think? That’s NOT altruistic, that’s your ego running the show.

datingoverthirty,fdarfqn,t3_ekezl2,1578249256.0,"Also I’ll add the anecdote, the way I do sex early on when meeting somebody;

I try to remain very flexible. 
If I am attracted and interested in somebody, I keep it as desire and not something like, “a plan”, and I’m happy to casually but still plainly keep things on the table while letting the other dictate the speed of the tempo I set. Things should never feel forced ideally, when I get a feeling like that it’s a turn off because I don’t have any desire to be with a woman that doesn’t want me, so I just do my best to keep things progressing but not at any particular speed, tempo.

I have no problem with different tempos, and I know this about myself, but everyone is different.

If a woman is ready to go, then I’m fine with that.

If she needs to take time to get to know my before heavy physical intimacy I’m happy to do that. (I always go for a kiss first date but that’s a different conversation)

If I feel I’m attracted to someone but I feel like processing more slowly, regardless of what they feel, then they’ll have to respect my preferences on the tempo, or it’s a no go, the same golden rule applies to them.

Never shift ahead a gear from the other, there should always be as close to parity in this as you can manage. Can’t stress that enough, it’s really the only way I feel it can be healthy.

You asked, here’s how I see it.
There’s nothing unhealthy at all abstractly.
I think what is happening is not a question of health, but rather of preference, values, and needs. Have you considered these thoroughly? You are feeling this unease and confusion because you aren’t fully secure in this, so all you need to do is do more self examination to figure it out.

Remember how you felt each step of the way. Stop even caring one tiny bit about anybody else’s opinions on things, how did YOU feel, gut feeling when he did.... if your gut didn’t like it, then listen to it, for goodness sake.

datingoverthirty,fbdl4ln,t1_fbdkzft,1576765216.0,"No, actually you haven’t posted any sources, I can’t see a post that was removed, so; yeah you made an excuse, but you didn’t post any sources. A claim that you posted sources isn’t the same as actually providing them."
datingoverthirty,fbdkuv7,t3_ecraux,1576765014.0,"I’d say I’m somewhere in between, but I’d take quality over quantity if I had any control over it.

I think you are both right and wrong.
It’s right to look at it as being on the hunt for someone who will find your most valuable and you them, vs just lukewarm on those things. But you’re wrong in that it definitely is a numbers game, sadly, that’s the reality."
datingoverthirty,fbdkho0,t1_fbdju8d,1576764731.0,"Oh, so, no sources. Ok then."
datingoverthirty,fbda38r,t3_eclmhf,1576754503.0,"Develop you’re self esteem and self worth, look inward because you are basing far too much on the external world, what they think of you, etc. none of that matters, this is life basics man. You’re going to be selling yourself short in every aspect until you diminish this insecurity. 
Get on it."
datingoverthirty,fbd9yup,t3_ecr6x5,1576754341.0,I don’t support your  experiment.
datingoverthirty,fbd9x2c,t1_fbd9kj8,1576754273.0,Yeah no shit. It’s invalid till I see a Source.

datingoverthirty,fbbg9t5,t1_fbbf7im,1576699833.0,"Hmmmm, really? Cause, I dunno, I’m skeptical. If you really did all this hyper cringeworthy stuff how do you expect us to believe “this is by no means how I act when I date women”? If you did this for a woman you don’t even date, then you’re the most inconsistent person in the world if you are also a doormat elsewhere."
