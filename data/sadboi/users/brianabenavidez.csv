HealthAnxiety,famyn94,t1_famw3pd,1576216965.0,I believe when I was first referred to my specialist a few years ago he did say I had CIN 1 But I didn‚Äôt need any biopsy‚Äôs or procedures

HealthAnxiety,famm4q5,t1_famlsj8,1576207181.0,My mother didn‚Äôt get me the shots because as a child I was too afraid to get it and because she felt that it was too experimental at the time.

HealthAnxiety,fa9ufnd,t3_e88skb,1575892301.0,"I have suffered from the same fear. It comes and goes for me. I am currently waiting for some test results to see if I have cancer cells in my cervix. I should be the one freaking out I‚Äôm desperately waiting for a phone call. They could call me today. .my life might change in an instant. But surprisingly I‚Äôm staying calm for once. One thing I have been telling myself for my HA is ‚ÄúIf I do have something illness wise, I‚Äôll deal with it when the time comes. For now I won‚Äôt worry about the what-ifs.‚Äù I was making myself sick by worrying over nothing. Therapy has helped me, CBT has helped as well. Good luck.üçÄ"
