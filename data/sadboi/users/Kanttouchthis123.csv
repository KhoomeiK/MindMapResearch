I write ""black grandpa me"" because when I was in the psych ward my intake nurse was this older black gentleman named Phil who was just the most comforting, funny, gently firm, no nonsense, calm, nurturing, upright presence and though I love my stoic asian dad, Phil represented a calmer, more nurturing dad figure for me who didn't spike my anxiety and guilt/shame. 

I suggest you use a celebrity to be the middle ""adult"" guardian you, with a verifiable personality so that you can imagine them chastising your inner child in a soothing voice. Like imagine Morgan Freeman chuckling and tutting at your inner child. It helps a lot for me, hope it helps for you! (Sorry if this was unintentionally racist or offended anybody in any way)"

My personal hunch is that your interpretation of events wouldn't make sense though, the way i read it and imagined the situation is this; OP is saying the guy didn't even use the bathroom. I'm assuming this had to be a multi stall bathroom or at least have two stalls for the guy to be able to follow OP in. I'm assuming OP went to the bathroom, chose a stall, sat down, was in the middle of producing a deuce (prodeucing, if you will), and as he was in the middle of this process from OPs perspective, the lights suddenly turned off, and the door closed, and OP was left in total pitch black darkness. From a third person point of view, the weirdo bigot guy saw OP head to the bathroom, saw his chance to put OP ""in his place"", waited for a bit, then went into the bathroom himself and turned off the lights, ensuring that OP had to finish the rest of his poop in all consuming darkness where he can't see shit pun intended, which is an uncomfortable experience, if you've ever pooped with the lights off in pitch blackness."

Our media is so toxic and has tricked a generation of young boys and girls that this type of behavior is supposed to be thrilling, sexy, desirable, etc ; oh, he/she wants me so bad! This is not how real life three dimensional healthy human relationships look like. That desire is entirely about himself and how someone like OP in relation to HIM is threatening HIS image of himself by making him realize hes not a super stud that shags all the ladies he wants because all the ladies only want him because he's just sooo amazing. He has to confront the reality he exists alongside other guys who ladies want to shag as well, he's not the ""best"" or ""king"", and that he isn't the King player in his own mind he makes himself out to be bc some ladies dare show sexual interest in other men while he's around. It's just an indicator of insecurity and delusion."
Ticketmaster,fhfb1as,t1_fhf6kf8,1581539809.0,"I agree with parts of your sentiments, there is widespread consumer entitlement in the US (I'm assuming that's what you mean by this country). But it's a grey area; both sides need to improve. I personally don't agree with Chik fil As anti LGBTQ stance but I can respect and acknowledge the company does a smart and excellent job at training their employees, that's why there's widespread sentiment Chik fil A has good customer service, they earned that reputation. And as a business, that reputation probably increases overall business because customers return to it. So they're succeeding at being a good business. (Whether they're being a 'moral' business is totally another argument.) Ticketmaster is poorly run, and gets many complaints if you look at overall patterns in its Google footprint. It's been constant and the numbers plus time period suggests this isn't a problem with consumers, it's the fundamental structure of the company. So Ticketmaster is failing at being a good business. Consumers have shown they are willing to genuinely sing a company's praises if the company invests in always improving customer service, there's entire consultant groups you can hire to help boost your company's relationship and image with consumers. Whoever runs Ticketmaster should hire a new PR team, have a team meeting to have an overhaul of the structure of the company and implement changes + rules like not scalping their own tickets to drive up demand, and EARN consumer goodwill as opposed to just passively existing because it's one of few ticket selling companies."

Isn't the point of dating to get comfortable with people and see if this person is eventually a long term partner you want to be in a relationship with???? If I'm in a relationship with someone who Im in love with they better be mature enough to handle the fact I have body functions or there is no point in having a long term future together, life throws much harder actual problems at us and i need someone who I can be a team with. I'm so confused by this mentality, this seems like an American thing where we cannot accept we have human tendencies like pooping or farting and we treat them like abominations that must not exist as we try to woo others. Like by all means, be discreet and don't be gross or rude about it and take care of it, but what is the point of not taking a dump at a bathroom at a restaurant??? I'm so lost."

relationship_advice,ffj77qy,t1_ffi9yfn,1579992124.0,"Yes I agree with this. This post makes me sad bc OP reminds me a lot of a best friend I had, the way they talk and use cliches like “one in a million” or “if he hurts her I will break his face” is very similar. They have a very artificial, juvenile view of relationships and love shaped by romantic comedies and tv shows like Friends/romantic anime shoujus where the main character is a “one in million girl” Mary Sue who falls in love w multiple people and gets away with shit that would not fly in real life bc she’s the main character. She lives her life aspiring to hit these kind of “dramatic” notes in her life that align with how her favorite rom com would go. She also had a problem similar to OP’s ex. She constantly struggled with emotionally cheating on her significant others. She constantly lied to her partners. I and other friends would tell her over and over again to tell them the truth and break up and explore, but she would continually use her SO as a safety net and ignore our warnings, and the relationship would dissolve into toxicity. It was a pattern, like an earlier commentator said. It continues to be a pattern in her life. We have history together so I know she’s at her core a good friend that would sacrifice in many ways for the people she cares about, but this is one area where she is definitively selfish and weak in character, and she will continue hurting herself and others unless she changes. I hope OP and his ex can both grow and mature bc they are ruining any chances of experiencing actual healthy human love and relationships by clinging onto fantasies where they are the stars of their own tv shows."

The situation really isn’t that terrible I was just throwing a tantrum because I despise companies like Ticketmaster that are just horribly structured overall and don’t prioritize actually bringing value to the customer experience and are just there to nickel and dime in sneaky ways.

Thanks for the advice about the venue and GM I appreciate you taking the time to respond, that’s helpful advice I’ll keep in mind.

Like the whole exchange and situation is so trope-y, it sounds like it would be from a sitcom or SNL skit playing out. Like i can see a scriptwriter pitching how we are all jazzed about our massive McDouble sized Oreo charcuterie monster boards and all the French ppl are chittering and gossiping in French about us on their own French subreddit, and interspersed between elegant French sentences pop up the blatantly loud American words like “OREO™️”. Idk why something about the situation is just strangely hilarious and amusing to me. I think I’m just viewing it from a meta SNL viewpoint. Maybe if I was french it would be less amusing and more annoying but as an American all I can do is just kind of laugh at it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ we are dumbfucks and the world is right to laugh at our stupidity!

relationship_advice,fd7eje3,t1_fd557ck,1578203231.0,"As long as the person was generally respectful and obviously not a creep in their day to day personality (*AND THE OTHER PERSON IS INTO THEM AND EXPRESSES A DESIRE TO GO OUT WITH THEM), I feel honestly anyone would be at the very least flattered and think it’s cute if not exciting and potentially arousing. The fact that OP is embarrassed about it and they can’t control, cancels out any creep effect, creeps aren’t embarrassed by shit and they’ll let u know how much theyre thinking about having sex with you ASAP lol. And sneezing is so cute and unusual and just clearly your body doing it’s own thing and it’s out of your control. I would expect something like this to be a minor b-plot in a quirky~~ cute tv show like New Girl. If you guys get together OP u gotta milk this shit at your wedding toast bc it’s cute af 

Edited to say I do agree w below commentators only tell him if he first expressed interest in going out w you, OP! Otherwise you gotta go to the doctor and try to get their advice! Or maybe just imagine disgusting imagery every time you see him to preemptively block the sneeze? Good luck girl :o"
justkiddingfilms,fd7bfri,t1_fd79b3s,1578201942.0,"No I totally agree with and hear what you’re saying. Authenticity is currency on social media so I should have been less naive and more aware not to take anything at face value. It sucks because with YouTubes format and JKnews’ consistency in uploading videos over the years and their layout with where everyone sits and just the general atmosphere of camaraderie and jokes and laughs, it was easy to just fall into the happy delusion of “wow these are a perfect group of happy friends who are good friends and this is what real friendship is like with real people.” Not saying they don’t have real friendships there and they’re not good people but it’s nowhere near the idealistic friend group fantasy I built in my head. It’s just poetically a twisting of the knife bc I would just fall asleep to the sound of everyone laughing and joking and ribbing each other at a time in my life when I was battling serious mental and emotional health issues and they were the most comforting thing I had at the time because they represented “true friendship” between “real, not fake people” to me. LOL. Oh well, it was good while it lasted."
justkiddingfilms,fd7515b,t1_fczii8c,1578199520.0,"Honestly this is such an accurate take. I’m having a sad identity crisis with looking back and realizing this channel which I loved for a huge part of my life is actually shit and has been shit the whole time. haven’t watched them in years I mostly watched 2015/16/some of 17 and the neckbeardy shit is so true but at the time I stupidly shrugged it off as just them being them. Machismo is right, too. Theyre very libertarian neckbeards, the only thing theyre not as neckbeard on is racial issues but that’s also hit or miss. And you’re right, looking back now their convos would always get pushed to toxic areas for no reason. And ppl would be snarky and gang up on others for no reason. They were like this the whole time and only got worse instead of better. Sigh. I feel like I’m having a funeral for someone I really cared about in my head lol. I never thought they would turn on Josh like this despite the bullying, it really hurts to see even Joe join in and also it annoys me that Steve is just always there in the background making himself beard. No real loyalty or friendship besides maybe between Bart and Joe, just toxic power hierarchies and tribal mentality."
justkiddingfilms,fd71vvj,t1_fd1sdem,1578198419.0,hundred percent facts
justkiddingfilms,fd70qff,t1_fd4ja1q,1578198043.0,I’m trying to wrap my head around the fact she is a 30+ mama to a child who actually sent a text to someone over a literal game they had to play for their channel and subscribers. and that Gina was squad member who had her back and was “there” and will “vouch” for her friend; this is like a horribly written Degrassi/Saved by the Bell episode but these are real adult human beings who have jobs and are over 30.
justkiddingfilms,fd6zu4a,t1_fd53m20,1578197746.0,"I feel like it’s even lower than that, it’s more like 13-14 year olds. 16 year olds as far as I know are more subtle and don’t make up actual blatant full out lies as much they just kind of gaslight each other and start rumors. 13/14 year olds are the ones who literally state exactly the opposite of what happened while trying to drop Amanda Bynes era teen movie one liners or mic drop statements that they think sound awesome and will get them high fives back at their camp. This is like a movie or a TV show starring them as the main characters for them, which is the level of mentality 13/14 year olds are at when they play out these petty dramas. 16 year olds know well enough to hear how cringe they sound when they say shit like that and at least have more sophistication and finesse in their attacks."
justkiddingfilms,fd6yicb,t1_fd52f5c,1578197292.0,This is the type of shit I hate coming from middle aged women who say they’re “real” and “savage” when really they are just acting rude and extra. I’m taking down all my Gina fan posts lmaooo I’m so hurt rn
justkiddingfilms,fd6xqug,t3_ejelh0,1578197027.0,"The more and more I read about all this and how they each responded the more I’m so embarrassed with my younger self seeing them as this potential new vanguard of young, talented, trailblazing talent to shape Asian representation in LA instead of what they actually are, which is a bunch of regressed cliquey adults who still want to just hang out and operate as high schoolers/college students and still struggle with basic conflict resolution and social skills. If they want to just be in a company with only people they vibe with and see as friends then DON’T hire outside talent and strangers then act surprised when they respond negatively to your toxic workplace culture because you “out group” them and treat them unprofessionally. Imagine if this was at Chipotle and they were all line workers and they all made fun of and berated josh in front of customers. Customers would complain rightfully and higher management would pull them all aside and HR would hold a presentation on workplace bullying and hostile workplace culture. Instead they just want to blame it on “fake fans”. Fake fans are a thing but this is just clearly common decency that many have pointed out over the years but they stubbornly dig in their heels and deny and put their fingers in their ears. Also idk why fucking Steve out of all people being condescending irks me so much, why does he even insist on inserting himself here? Also totally lost all respect I had for Joe as I saw him as the most “objective” one who could admit when he was wrong and learn from it. Everyone sucks here. At least other YouTube groups like Team 10 who have these stupid petty in group dramas are 1. young adults and in some cases still teenagers 2. have actual teenage audiences 3. are so vastly massive and successful in music, touring, merchandizing, and branding that it’s less surprising there is toxicity and politics behind the scenes and had to deal with legit mainstream media attention. This is so embarrassing coming from them, a bunch of middle aged adults with a middling company. Also fuck Steve I never got why the comments thought he was funny, what a wannabe try hard barnacle."
justkiddingfilms,fd6qrcz,t1_fcx876r,1578194569.0,"If this is all true I feel so horrible for Josh. Years of bullying is a shitpile, but just that one thing is such a slap to the face, I would fucking chew someone out on camera if they disrespected me or anyone I loved like that. That’s so blatantly disrespectful. Not to mention I hate how they advertise themselves as “real” because Gina doing that is some quintessential two-faced backhanded fake ass bullshit. To not even let josh know and to just lie to the audience. I never thought she would be someone who would do something like that. Definitely not who I thought she was and I’m saddened by all of this."
justkiddingfilms,fd6pwx0,t1_fcwt2en,1578194282.0,Literally what the fuckkkk this keeps getting worse and worse. So Steve and Nikki are also shockingly immature middle schooler pieces of shit as well. And what the fuck I’m so floored at the Gina birthday thing. I looked up to her when I was younger bc she was so “real” and an “older cooler sister I never had but I wanted” type for me and she does this. So that “real” persona was apparently just code for “enjoys drama” and “can’t handle personal conflict professionally”. I watched her on that random car show too she was on and rooted for her and thought she was so amazing and “real”. Literally done with jkfam theyre not an actual “fam” they’re just a bitchy high school clique.
justkiddingfilms,fd6la2h,t1_fcwp89o,1578192676.0,"Bart would subtly pick on Julia too but it was more in a dismissive subtle way like an almost eye roll or facial expression or silence instead of him actually saying stuff to her. I can almost promise you Geo and him talked shit about her when they got home, if Geo made fun of Julia right in front of him without him saying anything you know both of them were of similar mindsets. Couples are like that; sometimes the more outwardly catty one does all the bullying while the other one is more a silent onlooker, they both are in agreement about whichever poor person they’re judging. Julia really didn’t deserve the shit they gave her and they owe her a huge apology considering she was a fucking producer for them and only committed the crime of being “awkward” and not having a certain personality type that would “gel” with their in group. I hope her and Josh have an actual real group of friends and ppl who they can hang out with freely and just be themselves without being judged mercilessly for no reason"
justkiddingfilms,fd6k6wt,t1_fcw7ntu,1578192271.0,"Literally commenting to say I 100% agree with u as a former also heavy watcher during 2015/2016/2017; the constant Geo bullying and condescending rude jabs at Julia were so bad in so many videos and ppl pointed it out in the comments, and esp in some JK party videos. I had and still have extreme issues with anxiety and a general anxiety disorder that now are 80% better because of cognitive therapy and medication; I remember being so distressed and hurt at the time watching those parts of the videos because I knew exactly how Julia felt  and just the energy and vibes of every “Geo mocking or being condescending to Julia” moment was so reminiscent of interactions I’ve had before and Julia reacted basically exactly the same ways I did or said something similar to what I would say when I had to deal with Geo types. I wrongly assumed however Geo and others would mature, grow up, change, realize they were wrong, maybe even apologize to Julia, but idk anymore. I hope Josh and Julia and the others who kind of got some of it get to heal and move on bc I don’t expect a reconciliation anytime soon. Also idk where David is in all of this and I’m afraid to look him up bc out of everybody I would expect him (or maybe joe) to step up and be the adult in the room."
justkiddingfilms,fd6ilta,t3_eiwxyr,1578191595.0,"I am so so out of the loop wtf I haven’t caught up with them in like 3 years and just searched them randomly on a whim today. This is so fucking sad and disappointing that even now they still have the same shitty high school in-group bully mentalities and thing with josh, I watched their videos in 2015 and even back then everyone was upset with how they bullied josh and Julia and others. I loved their videos regardless of many things they said or did that I disagreed with and I still have a soft spot for them despite everything bc they were such a big part of my life for a while, esp in a dark time in my life where I was battling depression and would just listen to their videos to fall asleep to. I agree with someone else on the sub when I say I’m not surprised they haven’t advanced as much in their professional careers if this is still where their mindsets and attitudes are at. I was always upset at the bullying even back then but I assumed over time it would get better as people matured and they would grow out of it and get closer. Apparently fucking not, this is the literal definition of arrested development. Their behavior even back in 2015 was already so embarrassing considering they were in their late twenties/early thirties if I’m not mistaken, I would think it’s unacceptable for ppl past 22,23 to act that way. I am so sad and disappointed, I was rooting for them to grow big in Hollywood as Asian American creators. I’m really disapppointed holy shit, I haven’t even read everything yet I’m still just shaking my head that they can’t evolve. I and other people I know were also toxic when we were younger but we acknowledged that and worked on ourselves. Very embarrassing that they can’t do normal adult shit like self examination. Also Gina was one of my faves and I always liked how she was genuinely caring towards Julia who I super identified with at the time due to having crippling general anxiety and having the same types of interactions with Geo types, so reading her tweet is just really really a disappointment. I also loved Geo and Bart despite Geo’s occasional bullying of Julia and both of them being sort of toxic at times but now I’m just really giving up hope on them changing, even though I still hope they can. I haven’t even looked up what Amber said exactly or where David is in all of this I’m just feeling very let down because I personally feel they were like the friends I needed at one point in my life who grew me in certain ways, and now looking back on these years I’ve grown and changed a lot but it seems they were still stuck in patterns that they should have left long ago. I hope they can realize from this happening that they seriously need to come together as a group and atone for certain things as well as take seriously overall structural and behavioral changes. Idk. This is emotionally such a weird thing for me to be reading this bc it feels like I’ve traveled back in time when I expected them all to be at way bigger stages in their careers."
