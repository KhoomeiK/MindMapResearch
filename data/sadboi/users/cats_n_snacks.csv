relationship_advice,ffu3t5m,t1_ffu3cep,1580233885.0,Yeah. I mean I know I definitely wouldn’t even put myself in a position to cheat but even talking to this guy is enough to ruin a relationship if I continue doing it
relationship_advice,ffu3ae9,t1_ffu2zxl,1580233564.0,"We’ve been together for a year and a half. The problem for me is that when there is a problem, he does work on it but then reverts back to his old ways within a month. so I know he’s capable it just seems like he doesn’t care enough."

mentalhealth,fdtcvy2,t3_emwi3w,1578714962.0,WELL DONE. That is a HUGE step! I struggle with the same thing and when I build up the courage and go for it... it really does feel great!
AustralianCattleDog,fdmdr2h,t3_eljq3o,1578546611.0,They have to burn the rest out before the big (small) crash! My girl does this after nearly any amount of exercise she gets big or small. It’s nuts!

BorderlinePDisorder,fdltzad,t3_eluzu5,1578532444.0,"Yes. Unfortunately, when I get emotionally overwhelmed I always dig into my arm with my nails. For me, afterwards, I feel really ashamed and I hide my arms until you can’t see the marks anymore. While I’m doing it though I feel it’s my only outlet to get my stress and  crying under control. I do it without even thinking"
ADHD,fdcy069,t3_ekgk23,1578287659.0,"This thread reminds me of so many stories but one particularly of my brother. 

My older brother would come home late a lot and ransack the kitchen (I know, I know). Nearly EVERY TIME he would do it he would, for some reason, put hot dogs in the microwave and then forget about them. And also cook them for nearly 10 minutes so our entire house would smell like burnt hot dogs for DAYS. We went through 3-4 microwaves before my parents put a stop to it."
ADHD,fdcx4fi,t3_ekgk23,1578286887.0,"One time I completely zoned out and instead of putting mouthwash in the lid to rinse  (not sure if everyone does that but, I always have) I poured it directly into my hand and only noticed when it started splashing on the floor. 


Then an embarrassingly short time later I was about to brush my teeth and put my toothbrush directly under the hand soap dispenser, pumped out globs of soap onto my toothbrush and only noticed when I was about to put it in my mouth."
BorderlinePDisorder,fd3ihzo,t1_fd3hn5e,1578158633.0,"That really helps me, thank you. I’m really looking forward to learning ways to cope and react to situations that normally trigger me to react in a negative and over the top manner. Best of luck on your ongoing journey!"
BorderlinePDisorder,fd2w8d3,t3_eiv6j2,1578152223.0,I am in the same exact boat that you are. Although I’ve very recently discovered I most likely seem to have BPD. Good luck to you on seeking the diagnosis!
