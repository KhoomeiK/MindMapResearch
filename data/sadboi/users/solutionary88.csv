Yeah I've gone more and more towards not eating, rather than eating crappy food. Call it fasting lol

I'll take a look, need to be well informed before I take my next dose. Working on diet, exercise and all the rest so I'm in the best place possible for md'ing. Cheers"

I was hoping to do a large dose every month, but need to do more research into what's more effective for improving mood over time.

Mm i've only taken lsd, never tried shrooms. Be interested in experiencing the difference at lowish doses, then md'ing my favourite one.

For sure, bought a bunch of my favourite protein powder recently, replace some comfort food with tasty protein shakes lol"

Propranolol is off label in my case, for assisting with anxiety.

I'm definitely keen to microdose, shrooms are better than lsd for daily use? Keen to look more into ketamine as well down the track.

Mm been cleaning up my diet, though main exercise has been walking my dog ~9km a day. Prefer weight lifting, but there's a good burn from pushing yourself on a bike too.

Been involved with group therapy for a few months now, definitely helped me get to a better place.

First order I ever did was like 48 flavours, just 10ml bottles. Most of them were terrible.. Found there's only a few key ones you can really vape on a daily basis.

It's pretty easy to do really, just use a 1-3ml for the nicotine and 5ml for the flavour, then a 25ml one for the VG and PG. Blunt tip needle for safely and ease of use. Use a bowl of hottish water and place the VG in that for 5 mins, makes it draw a lot easier into the syringe.

Everyone's physiology is different, that's for sure. Though it's the interaction between pyschology and physiology that most interests me. Went down a bit of a rabbit hole with that one, when I was studying massage therapy.

Medications all have side effects, something which I'm sure is considered in the balance when prescribing them. It's all a calculated risk, not only for the individual experiencing distressing symptoms, but also for those they come in contact with.

I disagree when it comes to the efficacy of medical marijuana and pure CBD (99.9%) vs Epidiolex. I'd say when it works for a wide variety of conditions, then it's worth people using, or at least trying it for the issues.

No medications are a cure, though treatment or management of symptoms is the primary goal, whichever way you go.

keto,faytq4q,t1_fayk3sv,1576406752.0,"The first few days were the worst, found it got better after 4-5 days. There's some bigger mountains I'm holding off on. Don't want to get shaky when it's a 60Â° slope.. Was hard enough before starting keto. Be interested how it is in another week or two. Testing myself out on the smallest, more of a hike than a scramble.

How's your journey been so far?"

Wondering how much longer should I give it?

Still adjusting my diet and my main exercise has been resistance training, hiking up a local mountain."

Which method do you prefer?"
PEDs,fammdfi,t1_famktyq,1576207350.0,"I guess there's nothing wrong with PG, got plenty on hand and I vape with it. Guess I'm just more familiar with MCT oil as a sublingual solvent."
