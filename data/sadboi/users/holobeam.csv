ok its been a wild ride so far what has happened to me:

attracting possible future partners (??)
spiritual awakening,
becoming aware of supressed underlying mental disorders my conscious didnt even know i had,
working on my anxiety,
animals are drawn to me,
i keep seeing angel numbers,
and having feelings of panic. 
my computers/electronic devices are glitchy and bug a lot,
i get confused and irritated easily but that can easily tie in to my disorders

hopefully this all passes fast !!!!!"
