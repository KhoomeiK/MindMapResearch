I too sometimes struggle with depression,and as far as i can see it became very common disease in todays world.I am kind of stuck in nihilism,nothing really matters in the end we are all going in the same place(nowhere and everywhere?),but i am not pessimistic about it,actually its kind of relief,its just that one has to accept change,you need to accept inevitable changes(someone close to you dies,gf left you,you die...)thats the way things work in this universe.

I think biggest lesson i learned is not to be hard on myself.I made a lot of mistakes in my life,i am in my middle 20s and i have nothing i created nothing,but being hard on myself is not going to bring me any good.You need to be a little bit selfish and start doing things that are good for you.

Its very sad when someone you love leaves you,be it friend or a lover but it will happen sooner or later just let it go and be thankful that happend ,connection with other human being is something very valuable.i am speaking too much now,in essence,just dont think too much and dont try to control anthing besides yourself,because you cant."
