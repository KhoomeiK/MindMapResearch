depression,f2xhpj8,t3_del3c8,1570478525.0,"Awful. I never understood how people can react like this. Like no one wants to be unstable, scared, and hyper-vulnerable. If someone breaks down like that in front of you they just want you support even if it just means giving a hug or saying I'm here for you."
powerlifting,euazzdr,t3_cf902b,1563636380.0,"I was a D1 athlete who has periodically dealt with depression, ranging from mildly to suicidal. What I've found is when I was my most active, like when I was competing or when I've been the most conistently lifting (mostly powerlifting) I always was in higher spirits comparatively. Depression is deeply physical as well as mentally, obviously. I think the benefits of exercise are especially important for people with depression, and I think it's one of the first things most psychiatrists/therapists suggest. 

Another benefit is when you feel like you're drowning in self-hate and loneliness, weightlifting can (1) give you a community and (2) provide you with a set of readily achievable goals that you can feel good about on an almost daily basis. Something to drive you to get out of bed. 

As always do all the other things too, meds if you need, psychiatrists, diet change etc."
