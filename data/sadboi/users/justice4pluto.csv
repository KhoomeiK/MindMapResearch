mentalhealth,fnckn8f,t3_g0rabm,1586839191.0,"I was thinking about this YESTERDAY. Was thinking: ‚Äúsomeone needs to define what BEST does and doesn‚Äôt mean‚Äù

Yeah trying your ‚Äúbest‚Äù and ending up in a hospital for exhaustion is NOT my definition of best, lol."
nosurf,fmy8k95,t3_fxzf3f,1586480451.0,"I read prior comments (didn‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm to mention already mentioned so apologies in advance if this advice is redundant).

I made a new reddit account with only hobby related subreddits, such as gardening, etc. Joined many subs, and I feel uplifted when I log onto that account. I kept the one I‚Äôm on now just because I didn‚Äôt want to forget any of the communities I‚Äôve found, but I use this account now only when needed.

To stop access to reddit/other time wasting apps I went to screen time, adjusted which apps are always allowed (Apple Music for example: is helpful at night if you are a restless soul like me. Better than complete silence and there are asmr albums on there, if that‚Äôs your thing) and which apps are not. I give myself a time to be on all apps from 7pm to 2am. 

I tried for midnight but my sleep/wake cycle is delayed so I adjusted it slightly for now.

I had a trusted loved one put in a PIN number so from 2 in the morning until 7pm, I cannot access the time wasting apps. I had anxiety and frustration but only the first 2 nights of ‚Äúdetox‚Äù if you will. I am not staying up as late and wasting as much daylight that follows. Getting a lot more done, happier. 

I don‚Äôt know if you have someone you can trust do this for you. It‚Äôs not like the parental controls from afar where parents can basically spy on their kids, and have total control.  The pin # is typed in on your device. If you feel a bit iffy, I suppose you could call Apple and ask if you could reset the PIN number for screen time *in case you feel like somebody might deny you the PIN number when you need it, something like that.*

Safari is a bit harder to block but it can be done. Just google how to block safari on whatever version of iPhone you have.

Yesterday I took a step back procrastinating using my laptop, which I‚Äôm going to ‚Äòsurf proof‚Äô asap. But I have made progress.

I dunno if this will help, but I hope it does. Also, congratulations on your success in school, and improvement in living situation.

üòâ Good luck

PS
Flipd focus lock is an app that blocks everything, you may have heard of it. But you cannot schedule ahead of time."
