But this is a relationship, not a one way street.
You want to listen to people who don't even know you, him or this relationship?
You said your communication is good, but it doesn't seem like it.
Maybe he really wants to, he tries but can't. Changing is not that easy, even if you love the people you hurt with your behavior or lifestyle.
I can't tell you what to do, nobody can.
But please don't just listen to internet strangers!
Think for yourself.
Talk with him how he feels about himself your relationship, everything! Is there more beneath the surface, other problems he probably could have?
At least give him the chance to tell, to explain end express himself.

If you end it and maybe realize that you made mistake, ths damage will be done.
It'll never be the same again.
Maybe it's exactly what he needs, don't know.
