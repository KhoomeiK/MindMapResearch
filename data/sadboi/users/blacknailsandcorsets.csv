EDanonymemes,fq5hfh7,t3_ggv0m6,1589105533.0,"It’s because of lack of fiber and food volume. There are few fractions of fiber, one is not digestible and it wipes out stuff from your colon, the other one is digestible and it puffs up in water increasing the volume, helping with nutrient absorption (for example stabilizing sugar levels in blood by absorbing it not all at once but in longer time), and making solid poop size. It helps when you are eating whole foods & plant based, because then you eat a lot of fiber, solid volume with little kcal, and also you get vitamins and minerals. It’s a godsend on a diet, because then your stomach doesn’t hurt so much."
