Cucumbers specifically mentioned at 9:57. Have to harvest them early so the plant keeps producing."

Hunting,etpo4vd,t1_etpa781,1563060479.0,"Yeah, for sure. When I first saw it, I thought for sure it had been there for long enough to be dead. This was the first time I'd gone out to work on stands and such this year. What are the odds that the fawn got stuck when I happened to be going out there?! Was definitely a relief that I was able to help it. Hate seeing animals die in such painful circumstances. Hope it is able to make it."
Hunting,etpnwzf,t1_etpbhw3,1563060323.0,"I actually went vegetarian last year before hunting season. Only meat I eat is what I (or my hunting buddy) harvest. I feel WAY better about knowing where and how my meat lived, how it died, and how it was processed."
Hunting,etpnmnb,t1_etp7a6m,1563060120.0,"It ran off. Mom was close, too. I heard several large deer bound off after the little guy was out of sight. Don't know if it will make it or not, but I certainly has a better chance now than it would have!"

Thanks for sharing."

Overwatch,ep8sczd,t3_bu6vwu,1559099224.0,"Really wish the mode randomly generated the hero order at the beginning of each match.

It sucks when some of my worst heros come early in the standard rotation, so I'm constantly trying to come from behind."
