That one is tough, and that’s one I run through - searching frantically for the next portal (where the light doesn’t go out).  Frequently checking the map is critical.  But I agree with you - I avoid it if I can."
NintendoSwitch,f1c0es5,t1_f1bw4wr,1569347073.0,"No anger - it’s a good question.  Continuing the runs at the lowest level allows you the ability to hoard cells to build up your legendary forge (accessible after every boss defeat).  The forge significantly heightens your potential to find higher level gear.  Once you beat the final boss, you get a “boss cell” you can activate, which ramps up difficulty and reveals new enemies.  And I think there are 5 boss cells available.  So replayability is there.

That all being said, I’m one of those guys that repeat levels anyway.  If I enjoy myself on a run (or a specific level or map in other games), I repeat it to beat my time/score/whatever.  I also periodically throw in self-imposed rules, like no ranged weapons, no deployable traps, etc.  It’s just how I extend my fun with a game I enjoy.

So...just yesterday I leveled up the legendary forge to the mid-level, but I can’t use it until I activate a boss cell.  That’s next."
