TTC_PCOS,fqyxct4,t3_glm8c7,1589756180.0,"I had a mc in 2018 and since then I was diagnosed with PCOS. 
A MC is never easy...ever! but I will say for me it was easier emotionally knowing there wasnt a baby. I mourned the loss of the pregnancy and not the loss of a little heartbeat...if that makes sense? 
Im praying for you. If you fo MC, physically it hurts and its emotional but you will get through it. Lean on your support system and dont do what I did..miscarry alone in the bathroom at migdnight because you ""dont want to wake anyone"" lol foolish"
TTC_PCOS,fqkte2a,t1_fqgwg2t,1589435749.0,How many days after your 10th pill does your period typically arrive?
TTC_PCOS,fqginwm,t3_gismhn,1589347283.0,"Ok so...
I just finished my first 10 days of progesterone...200mg a night. I was prescribed this due to skippinh periods every other month, sometimes two. 
My DR asked me If I wanted more babies and I said of course and had been trying for 3 years so she started me om prometrium ro regulate my periods and ""hopefully induce ovulation"" I guess I should have asked more questions because I am so confused now. She advised me to start on the 1st of the month. 
My questions are:
A) Can I get pregnant while taking the progesterone (first 10 days) 
B) if not, when should I start trying to conceive? 
C) i have had a MC before so I am nervous becauae I have read that if I get pregnant on progesterone amd suddenly stop taking it, Im at risk again...??"

Try to leave your emotion out of it and check in to see that they are okay."
