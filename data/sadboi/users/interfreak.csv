What surprised me with my depression, even though I thought this was the lowest I have gone, somehow, I still scraped together enough strength to pull through and continue onwards.

I lost my best friend Dax in October 2017, she was 13 and a half years old. A very loyal and fun loving dog, she literally followed me everywhere I went.

Before she passed she had a few issues (loss of bladder control etc) which I took her to the vet for, at that stage the they thought it was simply just old age and gave her medication. She gradually got weaker over the next few days but she still gave me a tail wag and lick as if to reassure me.

The evening that she passed away, she became quite lethargic and her breathing was laboured. I contacted the vet out of hours, who asked me to bring her in straight away. Despite her condition she seemed excited as she always loved going for a drive. By the time we got to the vet, she could barely stand. Outside the vet's building, the vet asked me to put her down on the floor to see how steady she was, and after seeing how wobbly she was decided that she may need some steroids.

I picked Dax up, with her head on my shoulder. I stroked her back as we went into the building.

By the time I put her down onto the table, she had passed away. She literally passed away in my arms.

Obviously I was devastated, but looking back I couldn't think of a better way for her to go.

The next evening I took her to my property where she loved to run and play. I buried her under a frangipani tree.

Later that night, I was sitting alone on the front deck of the house when I wear to God, I heard the sound of her walking slowly along the deck towards me. Because it's a timber deck, you'd here the 'click clack' of her claws as she walked along it. I was that startled that I actually got up and turned the outside light on, but there was nothing there.

About a week later, I dreamt I was at the property - it was a bright, hot summer day. I was standing out the front of the house on the lawn, looking around. Everything was vividly real. I then noticed Dax about 15 metres away, sniffing the grass looking a little confused. I crouched down, and called out to her. As soon as she heard her name, she ran over to me - still seeming a bit confused. I gave her a big hug, and said to her ""I'll see you soon sweety"", I have no idea why I said that. The dream ended shorlty after that.

Since then, there has been a couple of times that I think she is nearby - but nothing as vivid as those days straight after her death.

I have absolutely no doubt she stuck around to say goodbye, or simply to be close to me as she always chose to be. She will always be with me. Hopefully your best friend will give you a parting visit as well, regardless, he will ALWAYS be with you. Stay strong my friend."

Dialing back the clock or going back to default clocks stops this.

GTA V crashes are nothing to do with the card - it's a known issue that's been happening for the last two driver updates, and Nvidia is aware of it. The crashing in the other games are odd, not sure what that could be.

Was the card over/underclocked at all when the issues happened?"

buildapc,f1lc0cq,t3_d5utg0,1569550802.0," Have had my MSI 2060 Super Ventus OC for nearly 2 weeks now, very  very impressed with this card. The Ventus is very quiet at idle and even when under  moderate load (despite not having a 0rpm 'Twin Frozr' fan), that I can  now hear other noises I hadn't noticed before lol. 100% fan speed is the  only time that it becomes really audible.

I previously had a GTX 970, needless to say it's been a BIG step up from that, so much so I  wasn't going to overclock. But hey, that lasted a whole day before I  decided to give it a go lol!

Anyways, I used Afterburner's OC Scanner to look after the Core  clock, and then manually adjusted the Memory clock to a safe level. Core  clock was bumped to +210Mhz by the OC scanner. Memory was bumped  manually to +1000MHZ. Here's how it appears in GPU-Z:

[https://i.imgur.com/Mgt8sGN.png](https://i.imgur.com/Mgt8sGN.png)

Here's an Unengine Heaven result at 1080p, settings maxed out:

[https://i.imgur.com/j6Mt6Uw.png](https://i.imgur.com/j6Mt6Uw.png)

Very stable OC so far, and pushes it comfortably into 2070 territory.  :) I have a feeling I can push the Memory a little higher, not sure if I  should though.

The highest temp I've seen so far is 72C under heavy load (still not  enough to make the fans overly audible) whilst playing Control – which I  got for free with the current Nvidia promotion which also includes  Wolfenstein Youngblood. 

Ray Tracing actually works relatively well on the 2060 Super from  what I've seen in Control, although I had to use 1080p resolution to get  respectable frame rates (ie, higher than 60fps). Other non Ray Tracing  games I've tried (GTA 5, Wreckfest, Mafia 3 etc) can easily handle 1440p at max  settings, GTA will even run at 4K60 with some settings dialled back a  bit.

The only con is that at 100% fan speeds, the card is louder than I would like - but it will only go that high if you force a custom fan curve. Given that my temps are fine with the default fan curve, I doubt this will ever be an issue for me. At 72C the fan is at about 60-70% speed which is still pretty quiet.

Overall I'm very satisfied with Ventus OC, and even if it is at the  cheaper end of the MSI 2060 Super family. It certainly doesn't perform  like it!"

As you can see, there is a 7.5fps increase overall, and the max recorded fps is nearly 20fps higher. There is a 6.62% increase in the overall score.

nvidia,f0fvxku,t1_f00vigr,1568589926.0,"Hey mate, still haven't done the com\[paritive benchmarks yet (will do these later today), but have used the card a bit more and have the following impressions.

I've managed to bump the memory up further to +1000Mhz with no  issues. One thing I've noticed is at 100% fan speeds, this card can get  quite loud – but I've only ever seen it at 100% when I have forced it  manually. It certainly is louder at full throttle than my old MSI GTX  970 Gaming 4G, but not drastically so.

Whilst overclocked, playing 'Control' with settings bumped up sees temps rise to 75-77C  after 20 mins or so and stabalise. I notice the clock shuffles up and  down slightly, but it does not seem to affect FPS (GPU Boost 4.0?). I  should point out that this card is installed in a m-ATX case and I'm in  tropical Australia – so load temps would be lower in a cooler climate with a larger  case.

Here's my Time Spy result with my i7 4790:

[https://www.3dmark.com/spy/8541218](https://www.3dmark.com/spy/8541218)

Certainly no CPU bottle necking going on at all which is good. My  result is equal top position for this card (single GPU), regardless of  CPU. :)"

No coil whine to speak of either, which was one of the things I'd read about that some Ventus cards have before I purchased it.
