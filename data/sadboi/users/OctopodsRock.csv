I had my 30th birthday last month, and I just recieved an official diagnosis, so there are a lot of terms I am not familiar with.  What is RSD?  I have been trying to explain to my doctors how my brain just sometimes seems to pump out 3x more intensity of the emotions I normally feel, and other times it just doesn‚Äôt happen.  Does anyone know what I mean?"

depression,fj5jclu,t3_fbnxcs,1583034138.0,"It sounds to me like you are struggling to categorize different input, thoughts, situations, and feelings and that is a good thing.  Keep struggling to understand.  This is a complicated array of issues with many influences and causes (emotional, mental, hormonal, structural, environmental, moral, and philosophical) and it is important to realize that people are complicated, surprising, and contradictory creatures.  My advice is to evaluate each person and problem separately, because the human desire to classify often blinds us to other truths.  
       Depression is a complex illness that affects people in different ways.  Some get ‚Äúclingy‚Äù because they recognize that part of their own brain is trying to sabotage them (it‚Äôs pretty unnerving, if you think about it).  Others become so cold and clinical or callous because that helps prevent painfully vulnerable relationships from forming.  Still others are self aware enough to outwardly act as though the illness didn‚Äôt effect them, and they lead full bright lives where they bring joy to others (like Robin Williams) and yet they die from it anyway, and their leaving fills the world with a bit of the pain they tried so hard not to share for so long.
         Just keep in mind that if we discourage people from communicating about their pain, this can only harm.  It will close them off from strategies, therapies, medications, cathartic relief, or any deeper knowledge of what the root cause is, and therefore the best way to deal with it.  The only way to improve things is to learn to communicate and seek the relevant knowledge and people that can help.  
       If you do not have the desire or ability to help, then that is fine, but you can still help by pointing them in the direction of those that can help.  If we don‚Äôt help stop the stigma around sharing our feelings then people will definitely die from them.  
         You don‚Äôt have to talk to them yourself, just share a mental health hotline number, or suggest they seek therapy.  You don‚Äôt have to do anything yourself to be part of the solution.  Just think before you react, and try and imagine what life would be like in someone else‚Äôs brain.  Just try."

ADHD,fio8si8,t3_f8y0k7,1582578518.0,"The only advice that has worked for me is
1.  Be very interested
2.  Find a way to program it into your subconscious mind (say the word aloud while looking at the thing, repeatedly)
3.  With names, find something to associate their name with, like a color, feeling, or character from tv/book/movie"
ADHD,fio88hn,t3_f8vz9f,1582578206.0,"This is classic ADHD, if you aren‚Äôt very interested in it, you will have to work5X harder to retain any information or focus.
