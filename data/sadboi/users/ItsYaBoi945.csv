ApplyingToCollege,f6y8tn6,t3_dtml35,1573271224.0,"I disagree dude.

There's not much I can really say as a high schooler without any relevant experience as an actual admissions office. But I can only attest from my perspective that this process has been only damaging to my mental health and psyche.  I find myself doubting my self-worth and contributions to society as a human being, which sounds ridiculous but is only compounded by my depression and mood swings as a teenager.

This process exploits the absolute worst of developing teenager emotions by forcing everyone into a brutal competition for something which should be universal: a quality education.  Your point about Harvard being ""exclusive"" is completely wrong imo because in a perfect world, a Harvard education would be available to far more people than it is right now.  Teenagers should not be hiding advice from others from the fear of them ""taking your spot."". Teenagers should not be sabotaging other people's projects to protect their GPA ranking (yes, this actually happens).  Teenagers should not have to go through this much stress for something that affects 5% of the average human's life.

More importantly, there are not only ways to improve the current admissions process, but examples of it being done.  In many European countries and Canada, high ranking universities are far more self-selecting, and accept far more applicants as a result.  The latest figures for the University of Toronto, the highest ranked university in Canada, show a 40% acceptance rate.  I've talked with many a European person who describes our process in the US as unnecessary cruel and tedious, damaging to our mental health, and in one case even ""barbaric.""

This process of cutthroat competition and meaningless drivel is not how it has to be.  It's the way it is from a long history, and remember that just 50 years ago, you could likely get admitted to an Ivy League school simply for being a talented student.  The extreme level of exclusivity is a relatively recent phenomenon.

Also our early applications are in, so we have nothing left to do but complain.  If you don't want to hear it, don't read it."

Penn still could have done so much better than it did, it lost a lot of my respect after reading this thread. It's not that colleges don't have responsibilities they need to uphold, it's that they can uphold their diginities and duties while also taking into account the well-being of others.  This whole story just makes no sense"

Being a pilot means that you have responsibility over the lives and schedules of others and that your job involves high risk work.  Getting in college isn't a risk for anyone, and OP isn't responsible for anyone.  If OP is right then honestly Penn just lost a lot of my respect, this is shady and unfair in so many ways"
