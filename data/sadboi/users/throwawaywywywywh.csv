for me, purging would be fine, but eating the ""bad"" food and purging for me, is worse than just abstaining or having a tiny bit or a regular binge because the effects facially and mentally last a bit longer in terms of me ruminating on it. 

the catalyst for me was purging before a beach trip with my family and having my dad catch me, and blab about it, inadvertently alerting my younger sister and it just. ruining my whole day. can't do it mentally, capable physically"

asmr,ffcvudq,t1_ffbalo7,1579808329.0,"Mukbangs are typically watched by people who want to have someone to eat with /companionship/ they like hearing the person talk/ tell a story, whatever. 

They are popular with an eating disordered audience in part because they can enjoy watching someone ear food without the calories. I don't, because it makes me hungry but some people like getting satisfaction out of watching others binge so they don't have to? 

Some watch it for the ick factor if they don't like the personality mukbanging, so it discourages them from eating. Source: have eating disorder, participate in eating disorder communities. 

Mukbangs aren't necessarily asmr - eating sounds can be a trigger, but mukbangs are not always filmed to be an asmr experience."
EatingDisorders,ffcgkd6,t3_eskx8y,1579798997.0,"you definitely have an eating disorder. anorexia doesn't look the same for everyone: it's not just a teen girl trying to fit in, it can happen to people of all races, ages and to men or women.

how often do you think about food? how often are you afraid about consuming certain foods? do you have foods that are off limits or unsafe? do you percieve yourself as heavier than you are despite being clinically underweight? a lot of people chose to become vegan to more easily disguise their eating disorder, and to turn down more foods socially. 

get an eval done with a psychiatrist, start seeing a therapist. men can have eating disorders."

Vindicta,fbuz2w4,t3_eelexj,1577122709.0,"On the ""healthy way of weight management"":

Intermittent fasting / One meal a day. Or, if it's ridiculous caloric binges, might even be Alternate day fasting (one day meal, next day fast) or a variety of a fasting schedule. 
Con: hard to do if social or living with parents. Requires good amount of willpower

Exercising. Hitting the gym. Using the food they ate to gain muscle.  
Con: Requires willpower / gym membership, not being lazy

On the ""unhealthy way of not gaining"":

Bulimia, chewing and spitting, exercise bulimia / exercise anorexia (you run/ exercise until you burn off all you ate and then some. This takes literal hours, and is very difficult (something like 6 hours plus) to burn it off) 
Con: heart attack, rotting teeth, losing hair, it being a literal mental illness

Stimulant abuse (adderal, etc) to control appetite outside mukbangs to cut weight. 
Con: heart attack risk/ addiction, premature aging, being tossed in jail for being a methhead

Laxative abuse (if you use normal amounts you only lose food weight, continuous use over time with massive quantities and you can develop malabsorption issues -causes you to not digest / absorb the food you eat so you don't gain weight. Obvious con of this is a hellish pooping nightmare. )
Con: possible need for colostomy bag, bowels can start not working without the person needing to take laxatives, permanent belly bloating is caused by lax abuse (you can n e v e r get rid of it.)

Diet pills like Alli/ clenbuterol/ bodybuilding cutting drugs that can literally kill you. Maybe they already have a malabsorption / hyperthyroidism illness like crohns / hyperthyroidism that either make it very difficult to gain weight, or absorb nutrients from food. 
Cons: if diet pills: expensive, can kill you if you overdose, can cause psychotic episodes / hormone altering results.
Cons: if natural illness, you die earlier, physical quality of life is shit, affects appearance."
