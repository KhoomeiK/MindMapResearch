But honestly, it's dangerous because the wrong landing could tear a ligament and a lot of people cannot afford that surgery. Even if it makes the dog happy, there are other, safer activites the dog could do instead:) I don't think people are being judgemental, just logical."

Female dogs can develop breast cancer, mastitis, and pyometra from not being spayed because of hormones, but again, cancer isn't a result of a female dog having toys. Hormones are. So the take away message should be spay your dog."
