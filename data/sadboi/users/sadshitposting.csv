depression,fpbv2cq,t1_fpbun6e,1588479474.0,it's sad yet comforting to hear people also have this terrible disease :/ I hope we both find peace
alcoholism,fp8gipi,t1_fp8cxpy,1588391713.0,Thank you! I didn't realize there was a sub dedicated to that.
selfimprovement,fp7g0ac,t1_fp4lmw2,1588369924.0,"Thank you for your thorough response!

I suppose I'm just trying to find my purpose in life right now, find what I'm trying to prove to myself. I'm trying my best to take things slow and just do very minuscule things like waking up at the same time and eating in the morning, but it's certainly a challenge in these rough times. 

Thank you again for your advice, you're right. I appreciate your positive outlook!"
selfimprovement,fp4fw8s,t1_fp43fp0,1588298172.0,"Thank you. I'm just feeling lost in life is all I guess. Nothing is really exciting to me anymore, I'm just trying to let go and enjoy myself. It's hard, but I hope I'll get there."
selfimprovement,fp4fq5y,t1_fp49ijb,1588298069.0,"Hey, thank you. I'm hoping meds will give me the push I need to stop thinking so negatively all the time. I'm fresh out of a relationship as well, one that helped give my life structure and excitement. I've felt incredibly lost and grim towards the future. I'm trying my best to keep myself entertained, but times are rough! Thanks again."
depression,fojq1ml,t1_foiu6s3,1587826939.0,"yeah, this quarantine is really doing me in honestly. i miss being around people. that is a funny thing, huh? the harder we search for things like happiness, love, stability, the less we find it. it's funny how life works like that."
SuicideWatch,fojpxs5,t1_foiwni1,1587826871.0,"thank you. that means a lot. I'm grateful there are people out there like you willing to listen. i feel better than i did last night, and im hoping for brighter days"
depression,foin3a2,t1_foi8dlb,1587790957.0,"yeah, i feel a bit better after this post, i got to hang out with a few friends. i hope that i'll be happy, truly happy, one day"
SuicideWatch,foieyfv,t1_fohtsfz,1587785083.0,"i often think about this a lot, just fantasize about what would happen if i tried to kill myself but failed to. how many people would all of a sudden rush to my side to care"
depression,foi6syy,t3_g76n13,1587779912.0,"i often think about this too, sometimes i wish something awful would happen to me so people would care about me without having to ask them to. if i was in the hospital, everyone would check in on me, make sure i was okay. otherwise, im sat here left to suffer in silence"
actuallesbians,fo9er9r,t1_fo97ro5,1587617515.0,"I was under the impression that pansexual meant liking a person regardless of their sex, gender, orientation, or looks -- i.e liking a person strictly for who they are on the inside."
actuallesbians,fo8tt1j,t1_fo8mti7,1587603693.0,Thank you so much!!
actuallesbians,fo8ts4q,t1_fo8oyv1,1587603678.0,"Thank you!! I read through this and it makes a lot of sense to me. I think in my relationships with men, I had to initially force myself to reciprocate feelings until they turned into something questionably real. This is very eye opening."
actuallesbians,fo8mh6o,t1_fo8jwwr,1587599459.0,Thanks! I definitely can see some signs in my childhood and even now that point towards an attraction towards women. I guess I just have to take the plunge someday and be with a woman I like!
actuallesbians,fo8ixv2,t1_fo8ifps,1587597454.0,"Yeah, I've kissed my friend before and honestly, it felt pretty comfortable. I also have weird intrusive thoughts about kissing my best friend irl whenever we hang out together alone."
actuallesbians,fo8it8c,t1_fo8iezj,1587597382.0,Yes. I've had sexual fantasies about women before and have honestly wished sometimes I was a guy so I could experience sex with women like men do.
actuallesbians,fo8hbij,t1_fo8flr7,1587596551.0,"I see, thank you for your input!"
actuallesbians,fo8ha1l,t1_fo8gl5z,1587596528.0,"Growing up I have identified with pan before, but ultimately it didn't feel correct because appearance does take part in my attraction to others."
actuallesbians,fo8h1gj,t1_fo8fimt,1587596396.0,"Oh sorry, this is kind of a throwaway acc so I've changed the ages on some of my posts for anonymity (and also so my ex who would frequent Reddit wouldn't find my posts about him). I'm a legit person though.

And yeah, I definitely am attracted to women and have had crushes on fictional men and women, but I don't have the experience with women to solidly say if I'd prefer them or not."
relationship_advice,fnnvg2d,t1_fnnv9in,1587102961.0,"I see, thank you!!"
depression,fmx6oui,t1_fmx6htv,1586459445.0,"yeah, im scared to trust again. i really want someone to love and care for me but nobody will"
depression,fmx5z2r,t1_fmx5hmk,1586459070.0,"i hear you. every time i feel like it's getting better, that ive met someone that will actually genuinely care about me, it's like life just toys with me and takes them away before i can actually be happy for once."
depression,fmx5czo,t1_fmx4zxe,1586458748.0,it is fucking terrible. i have nobody to go to and nobody to care about me unconditionally
