RilakkumaFarm,fl1anww,t1_fl19zuy,1584725260.0,Everytime I load up the game. Different items get black squares but its always an overwhelming majority. Kinda unplayable.
HelpMeFind,fghmso4,t3_eyjuqg,1580788421.0,It's used again at 5:45. I tried googling all the quotes I could but I couldn't find anything. It's probably something obscure but after listening over and over I gotta know.
patientgamers,fe38nzk,t3_enn3wx,1578846992.0,"Yes for me!!! I don't consider myself a completionist, its more that I want to see the history behind a franchise. I feel like I can't truly appreciate a good game until I know how it became that way and everything leading up to it. If the first games are crap it makes me enjoy it more! And the franchise will feel more familiar to me even if I had struggles with the past entries. It just feels like a better way to bond with the game."

depression,fb248gl,t3_eb0ggo,1576445211.0,Yeah the effort of life is the scariest and most exhausting thing. I already feel so so tired that death just seems so relaxing I want to beg for it.
2meirl4meirl,fb0ooyo,t3_eaydmy,1576427933.0,then they get mad and accuse me of giving the silent treatment and I feel like such a piece of shit I'm trying brain.exe just stopped working pls be patient
depression,faomes6,t3_ea5zl6,1576267597.0,Sometimes it feels comforting to be sad. I feel sad most of the time so it's familiar to me and it feels normal. So I also love and hate it.
depression,faokxob,t3_ea68w4,1576266661.0,"God I get the same fucking response from doctors. A college counselor told me exercise would help me more than my prozac (yeah no). I also keep being told to try mindfulness despite having been trying it in therapy groups for 5 YEARS. 

Working out just exhausts me and I'm also incredibly weak so gyms just like to rub that in my face. I find it easier to walk or casually ride a bike, if the scenery is nice then I don't have to care about the exercise part since I still enjoy myself. Sometimes simple yoga helps me with my anxiety, I used to do it when I had insomnia, but if you look up yoga routines you can get lost in all the complicated poses (not flexible either).

That's my own rant I guess, I related to this post a lot. You've tried a lot and even with arthritis too. If it doesn't work it doesn't work and it sucks exercise is always pushed so much as a cure-all."
depression,faojqb3,t3_ea69r6,1576265897.0,"Please ask him for that hug and kiss, after a long day at work it may help him too. If you're not against it physical intimacy is important and so so calming with someone you love."
depression,faoj45v,t3_ea6mme,1576265502.0,"If you can wear earbuds in bed I would listen to a lot of ASMR videos to relax me. There's a lot of different kinds and it works different for everyone, so if a particular sound is relaxing to you just search it up on youtube. If you want voices to soothe you there's ASMR for that too, but also guided meditations that can help.

I used to only know how to cut and I still get the urge a lot. Sometimes coloring helps me since its pretty mindless but still distracting. Feeling something soft and comforting helps too. If the space at home is toxic due to fights I'd honestly suggest going for a walk when it gets really bad. Being trapped in my house lead to a lot of cutting in the bathroom. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need more suggestions, I hope you find something that works for you."
2meirl4meirl,f4hboyx,t1_f4har3r,1571589992.0,"So someone in a group asked me to tell them why I hate the ocean sunfish so much, and apparently it was ~too mean~ and was deleted. To perpetuate the truth and stand up for ethical journalism, I’m posting it here. [Rated NC-17 for language.] Disclaimer, I care about marine life more than I care about anything else, for real. Except this big dumb idiot. And it’s not like an ~ironic~ thing, I mean it IS hilarious to me and they ARE THE BIGGEST JOKE PLAYED ON EARTH but I seriously fucking hate them.THE MOLA MOLA FISH (OR OCEAN SUNFISH) They are the world’s largest boney fish, weighing up to 5,000 pounds. And since they have very little girth, that just makes them these absolutely giant fucking dinner plates that God must have accidentally dropped while washing dishes one day and shrugged his shoulders at because no one could have imagined this would happen. AND WITH NO PURPOSE. EVERY POUND OF THAT IS A WASTED POUND AND EVERY FOOT OF IT (10 FT BY 14 FT) IS WASTED SPACE. They are so completely useless that scientists even debate about how they move. They have little control other than some minor wiggling. Some say they must just push water out of their mouths for direction (?????). They COULD use their back fin EXCEPT GUESS WHAT IT DOESNT FUCKING GROW. It just continually folds in on itself, so the freaking cells are being made, this piece of floating garbage just doesn’t put them where they need to fucking go. So they don’t have swim bladders. You know, the one thing that every fish has to make sure it doesn’t just sink to the bottom of the ocean when they stop moving and can stay the right side up. This creature. That can barely move to begin with. Can never stop its continuous tour of idiocy across the ocean or it’ll fucking sink. EXCEPT. EXCEPT. When they get stuck on top of the water! Which happens frequently! Because without the whole swim bladder thing, if the ocean pushes over THE THINNEST BUT LARGEST MOST TOPPLE-ABLE FISH ON THE PLANET, shit outta luck! There is no creature on this earth that needs a swim bladder more than this spit in the face of nature, AND YET. Some scientists have speculated that when they do that, they are absorbing energy from the sun because no one fucking knows how they manage to get any real energy to begin with. So they need the sun I guess. But good news, when they end up stuck like that, it gives birds a chance to land on their goddamn island of a body and eat the bugs and parasites out of its skin because it’s basically a slowly migrating cesspool. Pros and cons. “If they are so huge, they must at least be decent predators.” No. No. The most dangerous thing about them is, as you may have guessed, their stupidity. They have caused the death of one person before. Because it jumped onto a boat. On a human. And in 2005 it decided to relive its mighty glory days and do it again, this time landing on a four-year-old boy. Luckily Byron sustained no injuries. Way to go, fish. Great job.They mostly only eat jellyfish because of course they do, they could only eat something that has no brain and a possibility of drifting into their mouths I guess. Everything they do eat has almost zero nutritional value and because it’s so stupidly fucking big, it has to eat a ton of the almost no nutritional value stuff to stay alive. Dumb. See that ridiculous open mouth? (This is actually why this is my favorite picture of one, and I have had it saved to my phone for three years) “Oh no! What could have happened! How could this be!” Do not let that expression fool you, they just don’t have the goddamn ability to close their mouths because their teeth are fused together, and ya know what, it is good it floats around with such a clueless expression on its face, because it is in fact clueless as all fuck. They do SOMETIMES get eaten though. BUT HARDLY. No animal truly uses them as a food source, but instead (which has lead us to said photo) will usually just maim the fuck out of them for kicks. Seals have been seen playing with their fins like frisbees. Probably the most useful thing to ever come from them. “Wow, you raise some good points here, this fish truly is proof that God has abandoned us.” Yes, thank you. “But if they’re so bad at literally everything, why haven’t they gone extinct.” Great question. BECAUSE THIS THING IS SO WORTHLESS IT DOESNT REALIZE IT SHOULD NOT EXIST. IT IS SO UNAWARE OF LITERALLY FUCKING EVERYTHING THAT IT DOESNT REALIZE THAT IT’S DOING MAYBE THE WORST FUCKING JOB OF BEING A FISH, OR DEBATABLY THE WORST JOB OF BEING A CLUSTER OF CELLS THAN ANY OTHER CLUSTER OF CELLS. SO WHAT DOES IT DO? IT LAYS THE MOST EGGS OUT OF EVERYTHING. Besides some bugs, there are some ants and stuff that’ll lay more. IT WILL LAY 300 MILLION EGGS AT ONE TIME. 300,000,000. IT SURVIVES BECAUSE IT WOULD BE STATISTICALLY IMPROBABLE, DARE I SAY IMPOSSIBLE, THAT THERE WOULDNT BE AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE 300,000,000 (that is EACH time they lay eggs) LEFT SURVIVING AT THE END OF THE DAY. And this concludes why I hate the fuck out of this complete failure of evolution, the Ocean Sunfish. If I ever see one, I will throw rocks at it."
