I need a schedule (work/school/any other thing) to set my meals in between and also to set my shower and other things like that. What I hate the most that I reach a point where my bladder hurts too much before I get the energy to go pee.

One time, while I was living abroad by myself, there was a strike and everything was cancelled. No school or work. I suddenly had no plans for 2 weeks and it was the worse misery. Other people took the time to go out, visit other cities, hang out with friends, while I was struggling like never before to get out of bed. Some days I didn't eat all day nor did I get up from bed (not even to pee). I was so scared because I knew that wasn't normal but I felt incapable of changing that situation. Nowadays I just need to figure out how to make a schedule on weekends. Today I managed to eat brunch and dinner at least!"

I observed other dancers and they didn't seem to be doing much outside of dancing. I refuse to be shaped by just one thing.

Complaining that I didn't want to be my sibblings babysitter and that I wanted to play with my friends (I was a kid) was deemed disrespectful and ungrateful.

Later on, my career choice was wrong according to nmom. Up until the end she insisted I should have studied Math (simply because I did well in school) she kept saying it was selfish that I didnt study math since it came easy to me and not to other people. It was boring af to me. 

Then when I wanted to move out she kept me almost hostage until she moved to another state... now that I live on my own she wants to tell me what to do with my apartment. She says it is not ok not to designate a room for guests for when they visit. I want my apartment to be useful to me. If i have guests I can arrange the futon. 

And then the kids situation. She wants to be a grandma and feels like it is wrong that I dont want children. And mentions it too often. She still gets offended when I disagree with her on anything. Sometimes she wants to come to me to gossip about her friends or people i dont know, I tell her I would rather not hear about it and she gets offended. 


Dont get me wrong, we don't have the worse relationship, it has gotten better with distance. But these are things that shaped my life up until now. I just have to deal with her tantrums now and then when I stand my ground. I love her but I wish I had a different childhood because I feel I will need therapy for life."

My nmom is another story. I would yell at her that the fear and pain wouldn't make me respect her because she was disrespecting me and abusing me while she hit me with the belt.

A few times she slipped handwritten letters under my door accepting her mistake/mistreatment/harshness, and even apologizing, but I never forget that in every letter she would write that I shouldn't mention the letter to her after I having read it. The pride was too much to have a face to face apology or her accepting that what she did was wrong.

I have been doing my gel manis at home for about a year and a half, after a several bad experiences at nail salons. Once I got a really horrible infection because of how much the technician cut me around the nails. So I decided I wanted to do my own nails. 

I have super thin and fragile nails, and regular nail polish, even with strengthening treatments and strengthening base coats, etc, always ends up chipping  and my nails break. Gel has been a nail savior for me! I have gone to gel salons that are fine, but even with them using more expensive products than I use, my manis last just as long, if not longer, when I do them at home.

These are my natural nails, and I can only keep them long and strong with gel.

Products used:
- Venalisa primer
- Venalisa base coat
- Venalisa color coat (from lightest to darkest) : 916, 919, 922, 947 and 926
- Venalisa Longwear top coat

I do buy a lot of products from Aliexpress, mainly Vanelisa and Born Pretty gel brands and I have 0 issues with those brands."

ColourPop,fk6pqhd,t3_feq3vo,1583910740.0,"Oh no, I checked my tracking number for my last order and it sent me to the DHL page, I really don't like their service ugh. It does say tho, that it will be delivered by USPS at the bottom of the DHL page so I don't know what is going on"
ColourPop,fk6ougq,t3_fgj5s0,1583909661.0,"I am sorry it was like this. Also, I have no experience with the twitter CP minions, but I've had some issues with the instagram ones, they can be so defensive and a bit aggressive ugh"
cats,fk6od1o,t3_fgosqg,1583909101.0,"I am truly sorry for your loss. I am glad he got to spend some years with a loving family. I am crying like a baby right now, my cats are young but I don't want to imagine not having them with me."
ADHD,fjo1lzv,t1_fjnxd91,1583518682.0,"You are not being very helpful. Just because you could change your mindset and that made everything better for you, it means that everyone can do the same. For some people ADHD takes frustration to another level. After trying so many methods to be better, and seeing how nothing works, of course it will feel like a horrible condition. After being fired from several jobs, and spending 7 years in a 4 year degree, it really does put it into perspective, how much it can affect your functioning. If it were as easy as thinking positive thoughts, there wouldn't be any discussions about adhd. You say that once you were able to put the work you got out of it, news flash! Not everyone has the capacity to do that without theraphy and/or medicine. Your logic is similar to that of people telling depressed folks to just be more positive and take more sunlight...."

ADHD,fizuup1,t1_fixhznm,1582875665.0,"Whenever my mom would say that I didn't care and that I was being like this in purpose (taking forever to do the dishes, not taking out the trash in time, forgetting the clothes in the washing machine, etc..) I would wonder if she really thought I would want to disappoint her everyday? If I would get her upset on purpose knowing that she could hit me or punish me? I sometimes asked her if she thought I would want that, she never seemed to understand my question. I really did care, I just forgot and got distracted all the fucking time."
depression,filkau2,t3_f8egtz,1582503571.0,I feel exactly like this. It is so depressing. I am sorry you feel like this too :/
AskReddit,filhl49,t3_f8csdm,1582501757.0,"For years I have had many issues with friends forgetting about me and not including me in their plans. I often feel quite isolated when I am with people, excluded, not wanted. When I am alone I don't feel any of this, I have a bit more confidence by myself (when my depression is not being a little bitch, that is).

Also, I just want to listen to music all the time and that is nicer to do by myself."
ColourPop,fi2y0cd,t3_f608qw,1582092831.0,I adore it! Reminds me of my Sailor Moon phone background from the manga. So very pretty
