For all my bitching and moaning, and as much as some aspects suck, life is still worth living even if fat as fuck. Not being able to find love is a lie society tells us. One thing i actually like about being fat is knowing that my weight doesn't factor into their feelings for me. Clothes suck and my health sucks but i don't let my weight stop me from what I want. Plus even though it takes ages to lose weight, gaining muscle only takes a couple weeks to start making a huge difference in how you feel. 

I truly did not believe a word of that until i started my bipolar meds. I'm very pro- psychiatric meds, just not amphetamines"
BingeEatingDisorder,fqi9fht,t1_fqi63rv,1589392795.0,"Hah wow I know those feelings exactly. I'm sorry. It's not a fun road but getting somewhere with it is actually quite rewarding, especially because recovery involves healing underlying pain.

Have you been diagnosed or evaluated for any conditions? BED and other addictions are highly comorbid with some mental illnesses, especially bipolar disorder. Feeling ""careless and reckless"" during stress is a big flag for me because people with regular unipolar depression dont usually do that, but bipolar definitely does that. Both myself and others i know with this disorder have also been diagnosed bipolar. Getting treatment for that, primarily mood stabilizer medication, has been the biggest factor of improvement in my ED, not to mention every other aspect of my life. 

A health workup to rule out metabolic conditions would also be important. For me it turned out to be PCOS, which greatly complicates weight loss. I do not have ovarian cysts; mine was dx through bloodwork. For that I take metformin, which helps and also helps prevent diabetes. It doesnt really directly help weight loss, but it does make sugar bingeing... unpleasant, lol."

I just don't want anyone to go through this, or at least not blind. I have been fighting this stupid ED my entire life and only recently made any progress. That progress is due to many things, chief among them getting treatment for a lot of issues and therapy. As for my experience with it... oh, it helped me lose. I was overweight and bingeing but I was at a weight that I could still be healthy at with exercise. I wish I hadn't taken that for granted or gotten real treatment instead of this. I was put on the vyvanse then (again for other stuff, nobody knew I had an ED and was just chubby). I restricted my way down to the weight I wanted. It only lasted a couple months before they totally lost their effectiveness in controlling hunger (and realistically weren't anyway as restricting is just as disordered). I gained triple the weight and steadily gained in the years to follow. I am at a weight that is extremely unhealthy and it affects my entire life in ways I never even heard about. Even losing weight at this size is unpleasant bc the fat does weird lumpy shit and goes places it shouldn't. My skin is ruined. My health is terrible. Vyvanse was an enormous contributor. 

This, not to mention it very much can be addictive, especially when tied into another addictive behavior like an ED."

BingeEatingDisorder,fqi5es7,t3_gj1gd8,1589390437.0,"Ok yea I'm on vyvanse for other shit and this is an absolutely terrible idea. This stuff is hard on your body, hard on your mind, and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. Besides it only induces weight loss temporarily and usually through unhealthy means like restricting, which will cause you to regain the weight much much worse. It really should have never been approved for BED. BED is not about actual hunger by definition and this med just acts on feelings of hunger. Makes my eating worse honestly bc I fixate on bingeing. 


Working through the root cause with a therapist will do you so much better in the path of healing. Healing is about learning to read your hunger cues and respond to them appropriately, and taking something that muddles with hunger cues is going to make that much more difficult.
