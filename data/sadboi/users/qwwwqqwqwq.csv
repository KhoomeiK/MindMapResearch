That video clip really summarises what its like to play with him. 

His dad was the best coach i've ever had. Cai himself was incredibly nice as well as talented. My first ever try was from him breaking through and passing to me to let me score (I've improved a lot since under 12s, but it did help give me confidence on the field). I remember he was one of the only forward that could absolutely sling a ball across the field. 

I also played with Marcus Smith, but not as much, and he moved to the UK after u14. He wasn't ever the quickest or biggest, nor was he stepping everyone in training and scoring loads of tries (that was alawys the kid thats hit puberty a year before the others). I guess he just really had his ""rugby brain"" switched on from a young age, because the scouts noticed."

At least have a look at the comments of the /r/changemyview post. 

There's one quite good one that touches on all the things you're saying (which aren't completely unfounded, I agree that if we really want to help trans people we have to address the issues you're mentioning; doesn't mean I think you're right or accurate about them). They even include their sources."

 I never said its the only method. 

Best proven method we know currently.

Are you just going for nibs here?"
