My thought process on why rhasa and ledros are op:

Rhasa: 7->8 mana, still basically gives you 2 vengeance (14 mana) and still has 7/5 + fearsome which are about a \~7 cost unit stats in value. EDIT: Would like to see his effect nerfed (2 weakest -> 1 strongest?), maybe even fearsome removed too so he can still be dud blocked.

Ledros: The damage effect on play is fine. Him being infinite however, is not fine. It does not matter how much he costs, he is a must-remove threat that will just go back to your opponent's hand every single time. He didn't even get a stat nerf while he now still has cost-appropriate stats+fearsome. IMO nerf the last breath. Make it go back to randomly in deck or top of deck, preferably random in deck so he becomes an actual control card for people to use as a finisher since control wants to generally draw cards anyways.

&#x200B;

VERY Happy about lux, yasuo, mentor and lifeblade changes.

A bit scared of the battlecaster and scuttlegeist buffs since I feel like aggro elise/noxus will still be very prevalent while the latter card might put hecarim decks even more over the edge by giving them even better midrange."

LegendsOfRuneterra,fgmswlm,t3_eyusvl,1580931388.0,"Imo the main problem is all elusives (and actually a few other cards too) are just overstatted or cost too little for their stats/effects/keywords all the way to hell.

I play almost exclusively expedition though, where elusives are absolutely insanely broken imo and almost everyone just drafts every pack with elusives they see and go 5+ wins while playing with a turned off brain, I have also been guilty of this multiple times.

&#x200B;

A few examples :

\- (3) Shadow Assassin 2/2 Elusive + Draw a card (compared to e.g. Statikk Shock (4) 2 dmg draw 1 or (2) Entreat: Draw 1 (champion)

\- (4) Silverwing Scout 2/3 Elusive + take 1 less damage from all sources

\- (4) Kinkou Lifeblade 2/3 Elusive + Lifesteal- (8) Ledros 8/6 Fearsome, Deal at least 10 damage to the enemy nexus, Last Breath return to hand

\- (10) She Who Wanders 10/10 Play: Obliterate all followers with less than 4 power from board AND HAND

\- (2) Shark Chariot 3/1 Ephemeral Can't Block, when I die bring me back if you attack with another ephemeral no matter what (nothing stops that effect except them having a full board already)

\- (2) Navori Conspirator 3/2 Elusive, to play me recall an ally, thus 9/10 times resulting in doubling the value (and cost, technically) of another card (usually Inspiring Mentor, which ends up turning it into a 4/3)

Correct me if I'm wrong, I might be biased on some of these, and wrong about others. Keep in mind my experience comes mostly from expeditions. The cards I have the most issue with are the silverwing scout and kinkou lifeblade, they are insanely hard to remove even when playing the so called ""counters"" in removal spells, challengers and your own elusives.
