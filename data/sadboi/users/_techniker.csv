AskFeminists,fr3fxww,t1_fr3e4q7,1589856568.0,"I think it's important for there to be a space for men to talk like that between themselves, just like we do. not to say that one or the other would talk over each other but on certain subjects certain folks may know better than others. like, growing up in toxic masculinity for cis men vs being sexualized at a young age for cis women.

I feel like it's fairly obvious that the majority of them are feminists, it's a place for them to talk about things from their perspective.

Trumps base is going to vote for him again. They need to, psychologically. They're fucked in the head by all the far right brainwashing.

entp,flv23cb,t3_fr404n,1585514783.0,"I get what you mean, as an INTP I was initially in my life extremely emotionally stunted and relied purely on logic to deal with things. but that's the thing, human emotions do have their own logic but it isn't what we as thinkers are used to.

it helped me a lot to learn basics about psychology, initially to understand my own emotions (I would bury all my pain and just explode in irrational anger sometimes) but then eventually to apply them to interpersonal relationships. 

for example, let's take your situation where you upset someone who's an emotional person and you can't logic your way out of it. when you tell someone that you have hurt that it's simply because your personalities clash, that it's inevitable, they will feel as if 1. you are dismissive of the effect your (perceived, im sure it was not intentional) callousness has upon them 2. you think it's an inevitability and you're not even going to try to avoid it

ideally, when you're presented with a situation when you've hurt someone, what you want to do is find out what you did, and why it hurt them. this could be a million things, and they may be irrational things, and they're usually tied to some past hurt, insecurity, whatever. 

say, for example, I have a friend that grew up always being called stupid by her mother. me, not knowing this, calls her dumb jokingly and she gets very upset and angry with me. I don't know her past so to me it just seems like she's blowing things out of proportion, but I tell her I'm sorry and that I won't say something like that again. I ask her why it bothered her so much, and then she tells me about her childhood and why she would blow this thing out of proportion. 

it's definitely a skill you have to learn, you have to make people feel safe and unjudged when they speak to you. basically you have to disarm the defenses they put up around themselves when they are hurt, whether that defense is anger or whatever other method. 

hope this makes sense or helps or something"
