AskWomen,fqc7i3d,t3_ghhleu,1589251742.0,"Notice patterns- in EVERYTHING! Notice patterns in rhetoric from the news, friends and foe, notice themes in your life, notice when something feels different, notice when something seems reliable. There’s usually more to something, and you can tell that when you notice the patterns. 

For instance, I was at a beach and approached me and somehow struck up a conversation with a dude. After he sat down he looked disheveled, and I notice it was odd he didn’t have literally anything on him, while at a beach. I noticed but didn’t want to figure it out. As we were talking he kept circling back to the #Metoo movement. At first I think he meant it to make me feel more comfortable around him because he wasn’t like ‘other men’, I let him talk himself on. Every time he circled back he told something more vulnerable/questionable about him. By connecting the dots it became more apparent that he had done something to an underage girl and as a result went to jail and became homeless. I made sure to text a friend to call me and get out ASAP. This is an overly simplistic, scary situation. An easier example is just like in the news when something gets continuous coverage ask yourself, why? Is there money involved? Is it because it’s that serious? Are they just bored? You’ll likely find something"

AsOneAfterInfidelity,fnfstig,t3_fy1017,1586914725.0,"Hey there! I’m so glad you were able to gain some much needed and deserved support here! I’m not going to try to persuade you any differently, because I think you know what’s best for you. It’s better to make a clean break so you both can grow before any big damage happens. 
I noticed a lot of people said they don’t understand how their partner can ruin something great because their partner feels like they are ‘missing out’. Honestly I was that person. I felt like I was missing out by being in what I thought was an amazing relationship with an amazing person. Although I voiced this with my ex, I never cheated. I was then blindsided by him breaking up with me, and then figuring out on my own that he not only was cheating on me at several parts of our relationship (which was for nearly 3 years) but also had another full relationship for 6 months with someone else while he was with me. 
I think this feeling of ‘missing out’ is because you want to make sure you made the right choice. Your insecure with yourself, and insecure about your placement in the broader world around you. It can come with sabotaging your present, because of insecurity of the future. I think it also tremendously plays in to the feeling of ‘wining’. You want to feel like you worked hard for the person your with. Everyone wants to feel like their sizing up with their partner. And although some people feel at ease when they get to a comfortable place in life- some don’t. Some people are not good with feeling comfortable and calm. They don’t know how to handle it. I was one of them. The feeling is valid, and I’m so glad you two have a good enough bond to talk things through. But I think taking a step back and reaching ‘rock bottom’ on your relationship can only help you two individuals refocus on yourselves first. It’s two whole individuals that make a great relationship. Not one half plus another half. 
Just wanted to step in and maybe create a little understanding for the other side, without advocating that the behavior is ok or will change."

I am constantly struggling with my hydration levels (eating disorder, hormonal imbalance, and eczema). In particular with sex that lasts a long time, although I might feel ‘wet’ it may not be enough or just idk changes at different moments during sex so maybe try some extra lubrication during sex too. 

This rings a bell for me because I am assuming that with toys you might use lubrication, but with PinV sex you might not think you would need to. But of course, other comments here might be on to something with your hormone balances."

Well that answer kinda depends on how you learn. You’re going to have to learn new patterns then the ones you learned from him, a new understanding of love than the lost loose ties you had with him, and your going to have to create freedom in the world you’ve created for yourself by yourself first. Therapy should/will help with this. In the meantime... what I would do, as this is a method that I do, is writing letters. You said you were a lawyer I think from the comments, so I’m mentioning this because I think this might be the most comforting to you. 

My letters varied from each particular situation I found myself in. Sometimes I would talk to them in my letters, some times I would explain why I think it’s fucked up and how I felt from it, but most the time I started and as I wrote I found my body releasing in a way I didn’t know I felt resulting in a letter I didn’t expect. This not only helped my physically let out what I was feeling but also then read back what I was feeling to myself. More often then not I was surprised, and then I was able to notice patterns(which brings me back to the first paragraph).  

So start with knowing yourself, be creative, learn from your mistakes, and create boundaries. The more you can do this from the inside(without bringing others in) the more the new better behavior will project and manifest outward. Furthermore as always the more you fix yourself the less others have the ability to break you down."

Once you set clear boundaries and follow through with keeping them you start to value your own needs. Eventually this will help you find strength and appreciation for yourself. 

Once you believe in your own strength, you get tired of running away from all the little things that upset you. Instead you’ll fall in love with knowing that your consistently and eventually improving.  

Finally falling in love with being upset. Knowing that riding the ups and downs are all apart of the process. Knowing that highs and lows are necessary together and that one is not more valuable then the other allows you space to feel optimism for the whole process. Because you’ll appreciate when your feeling good, you’ll then also find reassurance that the bad must pass somehow if your taking care of your basic necessities first. 

Which then brings up back to the beginning. Setting clear boundaries and setting your basic needs (enough food, water, sleep, and mentally/physically challenging  yourself the most you can each day based off each day) as your number one top most priority over ANYTHING else until you regain your baseline."
