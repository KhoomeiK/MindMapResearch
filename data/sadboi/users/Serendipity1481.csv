The plot is pretty much a girl is moving away soon and she's upset about it so her teacher and friends to spend the entirety of her last day at school with her and one of her friends mentions a ritual that's supposed to ensure they always remain close friends forever so everyone joins in  and ends up in separate closed spaces where they have to try to find each other to do the ritual again to escape and no one remembers their friends that died while in the closed spaces then it's revealed that their stuck in a time loop they can't break and when you think about it the characters that seem like villains are victims as well.
