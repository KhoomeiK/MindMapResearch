patientgamers,fng9t3t,t1_fng7h5p,1586925955.0,"I like rail shooters. There are parts of Extraction that don’t feel accustom to rail shooter design (not moving until the camera decides) but instead feel programmed for a movable action adventure game like the original trilogy. The slug creature requires fans to immobilize it and you can’t decide to immediately go to them or take cover to avoid attacks, leaving you getting hit constantly. I found the game to be a lot darker visually than the other 3 as well. I didn’t feel like the glow stick did a good job either. Numerous weapons don’t have much impact in extraction. IMO the best weapon is the one your originally given followed by the pulse rifle."
