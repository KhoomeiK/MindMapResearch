sewing,fmzlusz,t3_fvcvzc,1586524147.0,"I’m sewing “something” (don’t want to break the rules about the “item that shall not be named”) for my company. Corporate Office is sending some, but they won’t arrive until the end of April/beginning of May. My boss asked me to Google and see if we could buy and receive some much earlier than that. No luck. I volunteered to sew some to hold us over until the real ones arrive. The last thing I made on a sewing machine was a pair of boxers in home ec. I’m 37, so that was QUITE a while ago. I made my first “item” in question last night, but today I need to crank out as many as I can, as it was requested that I sew 25-30 by Monday. (I’m tracking my time, as my boss insisted, even though I wanted to do it on my own time for free.) 

Sorry for the long back story for such simple two questions: 

1. I find that I keep having to re-thread my needle each time I start another portion of the item. Am I supposed to be holding the two threads when I initially start stitching, or am I doing something else wrong?

2. Is it ok to start the stitch OFF the fabric so I know I’m covering the entire length of the seam?

ETA: I tried cross-posting this to other subs to increase my chances of more answers, or the chance to be exposed to other techniques, but other sewing subs either specifically say “don’t ask questions” or are just not the right fit for my question. 😕"

wewontcallyou,fk72cae,t1_fjwgaot,1583925522.0,"And THIS is a big reason why I interview so well. Before going to an interview, I ALWAYS research the company. Last week was my first day at this job, and my first interviewer let it slip that although they were required by Corporate to call back a minimum of three potential candidates for second interviews, she’d already decided I was the one she was going to hire. When the job was posted on Indeed, they received more than 60 applications on the first day, and they continued to pour in the next day. So I beat out probably at least about a hundred applicants. I’m an office administrator who works at a rebar company. I never had dreams of working in the reinforcing steel industry. But I made sure to research the company and integrate a few random facts I’d learned about the company into my interview and made it seem like an organic part of the conversation. I’m also talkative and outgoing, so that always seems to come through in my interviews and they seem to be valuable qualities to potential employers."
