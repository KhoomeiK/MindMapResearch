introvert,ff7wpt2,t3_es3hy4,1579660165.0,Yes this is exactly how I feel!! I eventually realize no one is paying attention to me and I don’t know what to say so I just become quiet and inactive but hate myself for it later
depression,ff71b79,t3_erqjbv,1579639146.0,I’m glad I’m not the only one. The reasons you described are similar to my reasons. I’ve had this fantasy because I want people to actually care about me for once and yeah the “taking a break” thing hits close to home. I feel like that as well
depression,fecpqi0,t3_eofgoa,1578980209.0,I’m no ones favorite person. I think I used to be but I ruined it and they found better people. It must be nice. To bad I’ll never know what it’s like

lonely,fc6lvp4,t3_eg9hot,1577483655.0,OMG this is me put into words. I've always felt like this. Like I'm always the second or third choice (mostly the last choice but never the first). I also just want to be someone's person. I have friends but they all have someone better than me. Everyone's better than me
lonely,fackmlh,t3_e8g9qa,1575941406.0,Yeah no one ever initiates texts with me. Actually one person does. That's it. But I love her so much so it's all good. The only problem is that when I talk to someone first and they say they miss me and when they see me in person they act like they really missed me (which they actually might have) but when I text them they seem to never want to talk to me
autism,f9fa2ci,t3_e4jh7r,1575263947.0,That's how I feel right now. I don't have an official diagnosis and I feel way lonely because I can't get help without an official diagnosis and I'm just desperate for friends and super awkward

It's just since I wasn't diagnosed at 3 when I was tested I guess my mom just ruled the possibility out. I just need more info on getting tested here at University on Campus

AskReddit,f4569jh,t1_f44tgog,1571367109.0,I always was the one to initiate first and no one ever talked to me first so I stopped and guess what happened... no one texted me first. And the one I did have I ruined that relationship wahoo

depression,f3tx8yi,t3_di4ub3,1571148270.0,I definitely feel this. None of my friends really WANT me around. They could care less. In fact they probably prefer me not being there. I stopped texting first too and what was the result?... No one ever texting me anymore. I always felt replaceable and still do somewhat. Like it's not hard to find someone better than me to replace me with. I went through breakdowns alot with this mentality. Literally anyone would make a better friend/person than me

autism,f39spew,t3_dfwxdr,1570754969.0,I talk to myself regularly and forget other people can actually hear me. Whenever someone comes within hearing distance I stop talking and continue when they leave. People have looked over their shoulder at me when I talk to myself and I'm reminded that other people can hear me and think I'm crazy. I sometimes talk to me myself like there's someone else there. Not like schizophrenia but I use words that imply someone else is there. It's weird to explain but yeah.

depression,f2rxspt,t1_f2rwyq6,1570377459.0,Thanks bro. I just don't think I deserve a relationship where they give to me. I've been trying to stay positive but depression makes that super hard. I always slip back

depression,f290vz6,t3_dcj6ve,1570076524.0,Me too. I had that back in high school (almost messed it up because of anxiety and depression yahoo) but being a college freshman and not having many friends has taken its toll on me hug wise. I only get goodbye hugs from my family when I get dropped off back at college every week. I just want to see my old friends and give them a hug but alas that's not easy

AskReddit,f1ymiqg,t1_f1y6iup,1569819586.0,I'm 18 and I was diagnosed at around 2 or 3 with shocking similarities to autism but not actually autism. I'm still confused about how. Maybe because back in 2002-2003 the diagnosis was harder to do idk. I've always had the symptoms but never was diagnosed with it. I want to try again but my mom wouldn't take it seriously. I'm concerned I do have it especially I was oxygen deprived at birth which can cause autism

depression,f0faf4y,t3_d4exjo,1568580388.0,I missed out on being a teenager. I never really hung out with anyone and had a hard time making friends because of social anxiety and a communication problem similar to autism. Also I never asked my crush out because I was too scared and didn't wanna ruin our friendship. Also I know my mom wouldn't have approved but I loved her with my whole heart. I regret it now because I'm graduated from high school now and don't see her much anymore. I miss her so much. I was just riddled with anxiety and depression my senior year and I didn't want rejection (if that was her reaction) to make it worse.
Anxiety,ezi3fgg,t3_d0w9gq,1567920662.0,"Yes I've had that happen. I had a fun time with my friends and I thought about everything I did wrong and how I could've done better, how much more fun we could've had. I hate that.

depression,er6lb7x,t3_c0l8i6,1560550430.0,I feel like this too. I feel like I'm just there for my friends to use me until they don't need me anymore. They talk to everyone around but me and sometimes don't even acknowledge my existence. However since I'm graduating they now decide to say that they're gonna miss me and that they love me and all that. But where was that attitude when I was still there. Anyways also I find it hard to believe how much they'll miss me because it's not like they ever talked to me anyway. I've always felt like a backup. Like a last resort.
