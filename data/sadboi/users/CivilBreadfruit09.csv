BPD,faafwrg,t3_e7zw34,1575908263.0,"**TW SELF HARM, SUICIDE**

I like your idea of using the term ""codependent relationship"" as opposed to ""FP."" Truth be told, even though I've had a ""Favourite Person"" for a long time, I hadn't even heard that term until I joined this subreddit. (Edit to say: It's not really a term that I use at all lol)

However, I don't agree with some of your post. I can't invalidate what you've seen yourself, however, I don't think **anyone** thinks that having a ""FP"" is *normal*. (At least, I've never met anyone who thinks this way - in my day-to-day life, where I'm the only one I know with BPD.) I think it's just super common amongst BPD folks due to the nature of the disorder itself - you're afraid of abandonment and will cling to someone, doing anything you can to avoid them leaving you. Just like self-harm and explosive anger aren't exactly ""normal,"" however, they occur frequently due to the disorder.

I believe that becoming less codependent is a good marker of recovery and a solid indicator of someone managing the disorder well. However, I would just keep in mind: most of us (well, me at least - can't speak for everyone) **don't want** to have this disorder. It is absolute chaos and debilitating to basic functioning. Some of the destructive behaviours are simply a survival mechanism. I also have major depressive disorder and anxiety, so at times, the validation and support provided by my ""FP"" helps me de-escalate from ideation and sometimes even planning for suicide. And we are both well-aware of the strain my mental illness takes on our relationship. However, seeking help is a process and it takes time. So we are trying our best to better support each other.

What are your thoughts on this?"

UofT,f70oo7t,t3_dtzsuc,1573330814.0,"I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time right now. I can see that there's a lot of pressure for you in your situation and you're feeling stuck, almost like you never get any time to take a break. And that's hard! I'm feeling for you.

What I will say, though, is as much as I know you're going through a tough experience right now, the grass isn't always greener. I'm a domestic student and I don't receive any parental support; I, too, have no time for fun, because instead of spending my free time studying, I have to spend it working in order to survive. I pay my own expenses including rent. Sometimes I wish I could enjoy life too but I have no other choice but to work; even in the summer, I pick up a second job and work up to 60 hours a week just to be able to get through. It doesn't matter, though, because my pain doesn't take away from yours. We are both struggling. On top of this, my parents, while they're Canadian, are across the country, so I'm pretty much on my own - and I have a disability. I'm now 25 and I'm nowhere near my degree but I'm trying the best I can given my circumstances.

Ultimately, I'm sorry to hear what you're going through. It really sucks when you feel like all you have to do is work and you don't get to enjoy anything or relax at all. But, I just encourage you to consider that everyone has their own battle they are going through. Domestic students, international students - everyone has it tough at this school. Yeah, some students may seem like they have certain advantages that we may not, but maybe they're paying in other ways that aren't financial."

AmItheAsshole,f6o0ai7,t3_ds1lzq,1573004543.0,"Very soft YTA, though I would say it could also be an NAH situation. I think you were coming from a good place! But she kinda has a point as well. Based on the quote she said, it feels like her comment was maybe more directed at the men who DO make a big deal about periods - not as a discussion opener necessarily, but just a comment made out of frustration. And it's great that you're not one of them!! 

I think you meant well but it was perhaps a bit unnecessary to say all that. I don't believe it's unreasonable for women to say they find their own periods gross, because, yeah, trust me, it's not a fun time of the month by any means. But I can see how she may have taken your comment as defending the ones who do. She made a comment about something she doesn't like, and you kinda just explained to her in long form why the thing she doesn't like is kinda justified. Again, I do believe you meant well and wanted to have a back and forth discussions....but I don't believe the Venn diagram of people with phobias of blood, and people who make big deals about how periods are ""gross"" etc has a huge overlap. I'm also curious, why you wanted to share this considering you don't agree with that opinion?

I kind of do agree with her. Because you aren't a woman, and you haven't had to experience periods PLUS all the associated shame and stigma, I can see how she probably felt like you were minimizing her and defending the very people she took issue with. However, this clearly was not intentional, and I think you came from the right place, so clearly, miscommunication and misunderstanding were part of it."

1. Your sister (likely) is in an upper year of her studies, close to graduating. You were jamming, ""not too loud,"" yet loud enough that it disturbed your sister from studying. She asked you to stop playing and you refused. Your sister's request was more than reasonable, and you could have gone somewhere else to jam to your heart's content.
2. You, the person CAUSING the issue, put the onus on her to solve it by ""using headphones.""
3. Your sister's actions were in the heat of the moment, and were focused on solving the issue she had already asked you to do on your own. And, she's right: in that moment, her study time superseded your time for leisure activity.
4. You did not suffer any immediate loss from this - you had backup strings. Your sister's actions caused you nothing more than a minor time inconvenience. 
5. You continued to play AGAIN with the new strings. And by your own admission, you began to play more quietly. Which you could have done in the first place...
6. Your actions far outweigh the damage - monetarily and not - that your sister's actions did. You effectively destroyed ALL of her EIGHT bras (I don't even own that many myself). No clue where you guys live, but where I am, leaving the house without a bra can warrant being sent home to change from school/work/public space, it can increase harassment, or is considered ""unprofessional"" and therefore garners judgment. Not having access to a bra to wear is a hamper on mobility. Also, for a lot of women (even with small breasts), going about the day without proper support becomes uncomfortable quickly, and can become painful after a certain point. You have caused a considerable issue for your sister because she made a reasonable request that you refused to follow.
7. You made a rude, unsolicited, judgmental false equivalence to compare something like a bra to guitar strings.

If I were you parents you would have received a swift slap in the face for not only your conduct, but your comment afterwards......let alone getting your guitar back at all not just 2 weeks. Not to mention, you should be held financially responsible for the damages you caused to the bras, which, with 8 of them, could easily total $400-600. 

My hope from this is that you take the feedback and learn something here. You showed so little empathy, consideration, or compassion for your sister. Even if you didn't agree, was her request really that unreasonable?"
