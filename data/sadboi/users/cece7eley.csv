Second, I don’t know if it makes you feel any better but I am a diagnosed with schizophrenia and it’s not the end of the world. I guess in ways it’s like any diagnosis, life continues on and you learn to cope. I have schizophrenia, but I’m also in grad school, I am getting married, every job I’ve held has been stable. It doesn’t mean someone’s crazy, it’s just a chemical imbalance in someone’s brain.

Plus I like how it comes in a pump bottle. If you don’t like the thicker ones, each brand has a lite lotion, which I love equally among them, maybe vanicream a tad bit more, but not enough to influence my purchase if cerave is the only thing at the store.

3. If you’re going to use actives, do it in the morning, you don’t want to compromise the tretinoin, unless your dermatologist says it’s ok. Too many actives can cause irritation though, so holding off on them until your skin becomes accustom to the retinoid will lead to less dryness."

I have a very small wardrobe (you won’t have much space to fit tons of clothes anyway, trust me my roommates tried)

I own 1 pair of bed sheets (I just wash them with my clothes and remake the bed the same day, I never even used my other sets)

2 towels, same as the bed sheets, I wash them with my clothes, I’ll probably downsize to just 1. 

1 pillow, though I do get a lot of use from one of those back pillows for when I don’t want to use my desk provided

A plant I’ve had for a while for decoration

My “junk drawer” is a small tin that fits my small first aid and my single nail polish, my 2 pieces of jewelry, etc

I didn’t bring any rugs, they dirty so easily and sweeping is much easier.

Only a few pairs of shoes, you’ll mainly be wearing tennis shoes anyway, but 1 nice pair for interviews and presentations is a good idea

I keep my sink clutter free, the stuff piles up easily especially if you have roommates. Also limit bath stuff, all my roommates brought exorbitant amounts of hair products and makeup and shampoos, and it was all thrown out at the end of the year. 

Spurge on a nice desk chair though, one you can see yourself using after college. If your dorm comes with a good one then use that, but most I’ve seen come with stools. Getting something you can see yourself using outside of college means you won’t have to buy a second one when you graduate! It’s a splurge, but really worth it. 

If you do enough digging, you can find a PDF of most of your textbooks online for free, at least I did. And if not, I only bought the kindle versions. Books take up so much room. 

It took trial and error for me to learn what I really needed, but I love my dorm now that it has so much less clutter than my previous years dorms. I feel I can focus better on my tasks, and it just feels much more like me."
