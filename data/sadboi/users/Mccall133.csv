depression,f667b43,t3_dqflss,1572708357.0,"I feel the same way and it gets me down everyday. I don’t have a single person to call a friend. I work in a school and I’m only 20 so most of my co workers are either 24 or my parents age. My boyfriend goes out with his friends and I sit at home and watch people my age out with friends having fun, succeeding in school, and I’m over here working full time, and barley succeeding in school. It’s lonely. But let’s not forget things we take for granted. Things that can easily be swiped away from us. Like family, our jobs, the fact that we are fortunate enough to get an education, things like that. It makes life feel a little bit sweeter to know that we all struggle but we also have things to be grateful for. Hang in there. Message me if you ever need a friend to talk to."

She will have full melt downs which lead her to psychiatric hospitals, therefore all eyes go on her. No one even sees me struggling and I feel guilt expressing because of her. I also go to work everyday and school and will look fine but go home and just sob because I feel so alone and misunderstood and uncared for. Me being so high functioning has led everyone to have such high expectations of me, while my older sister is expected of much less and has much more support."
