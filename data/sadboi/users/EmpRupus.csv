In case of human sight, the our eyes also have a focal length, hence, with naked eye, we have a certain ratio of how big an object at a particular distance would look to us. And this is different on a phone's camera. You can also try this by taking pictures of mountains on a road-trip. On the phone, the mountains farther away will appear much smaller than naked eye.

Step -2 : If you have to, use written medium, like chats and emails over spontaneous stuff. Send messages at late-night or early-morning, so the other person can't force you into spontaneous conversations.

Step-3 : If you have to engage in real-time, prepare specific outcomes for your conversation, and precisely keep the conversation on track, and avoid the other person's attempts to derail it. Set a timer, if the conversation is going back and forth for too long, excuse yourself out of it.

Step-4: Follow up on the conversation to make sure you are on the same page, and avoid any flaky commitments from the other person.

Step-5 : The task is not over when the conflict is over. The task is over when you practice self-care and re-energize yourself. If a difficult conversation takes 10 minutes and you need 20 minutes to recover from it, then the total task time allowed should be 30 minutes."

Most stores should have done this much earlier."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqn1obl,t1_fqlis2w,1589487172.0,"It's more complex than that.

The Neo-Nazi groups within Auth-Right believe Jews, as a race, are incapable of Nation-Building, and hence, Israel is not a ""real country"" but rather is propped up by Europe and America. Neo-Nazis believe Israel's prosperity is parasitic upon the West and is a drain on western resources, orchestrated by Jewish ""agents"" in high politics.

They strongly believe the West should end all support and alliance with Israel, and once this happens, the nation will naturally fall apart.

In fact, many extreme Auth-Rights who see through a racial sense alone, believe Islamic folks in Middle-Eastern countries are better at nation-building than jews, and believe conflicts in middle-east will be over once jewish international interference stops.

Which is surprisingly, close to what hard-core left also believes, except they use the terms capitalist, colonizer etc. in a horseshoe theory fashion."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqmzr5h,t1_fqla4hs,1589486249.0,"Yazidis are peaceful and have an interesting endangered culture, but they are not saints either.

They literally believe they are superior race, because they are descendants of Adam alone, born without sin, while the rest of humanity are descendants of Adam and Eve born out of sin.

This is why exogamy and race-mixing is prohibited, and many women who were released from Daesh sex-slavery were refused back into Yazidi society, because they considered such women ""impure as they have sin of Eve in them"", and thus, not longer Yazidi by definition.

The re-inclusion of freed-women is an actual ongoing process even now."
LeopardsAteMyFace,fqmwdqt,t1_fqmvrs1,1589484636.0,"Yes and no.

Under extra-ordinary circumstances, such as wars, famines, fires etc., food and other essentials are temporarily rationed, and anti-hoarding laws are passed.

And essentials are sometimes prioritized for troops, nurses or EMT over civilians. And when the crisis, is over, such temporary limits are taken off. While the ideas are communist, many non-communist countries have had gone through these stages, and such forms of rationing are well-known all over the world, right from medieval days of feudalism.

UK even developed a specific WW-2 cuisine around rationed goods. So this is not something unheard of, or accidentally stumbled upon."

The same leopard which allowed people to hoard up on TP and put the money in their pockets, is now continuing to put their money in their pockets.

Douglas is the same type of person who would argue ""free market capitalism"", hoard up on essentials and then price-gouge them. Now that Walmart went ""free-market capitalism"" on his ass, he is ""Noooo ..... what about my family? Y'all a bunch of greedy people.""

LeopardsAteMyFace,fqmuwyv,t1_fqmhszm,1589483937.0,"I mean ... it's not like Walmart is doing this out of goodness of its heart. No-return means they don't have to pay back money, and they have a valid socially-approved reason for doing so, and hence, it doesn't affect their general customer base in the future, since people blame the buyers.

It would have been ethical if Walmart had rules that prevent hoarding up of toilet paper. Instead, they sold them from their end put the money in their pockets, and now, it's a decision of not giving the money back."

Must be because of the economy, and not merely size.

You're right, when I visited Tokyo, my jaws dropped. This was a REAL city-city like they show in futuristic movies. It was like 7-8 Manhattans arranged in a ring. New York City looks like a quaint small-town before the monstrosity which is Tokyo.

Also, while Manhattan just has skyscrapers alone, Tokyo had lots of horizontal sky-bridges, and air-trains running love ground in between skyscrapers, along with shops underneath train tracks, water-canals and bridges all mixed up together. And their underground subway-stations look like giant underground shopping Malls in themselves."

insaneparents,fqk6a6h,t1_fqii3xp,1589420967.0,"> All it meant was I didn’t eat the steak they cooked for dinner and ate primarily sides instead. 

Definitely an emotional issue.

I went on a low-carb / paleo diet and as soon as I visited home, my parents went bat-shit crazy, claiming I was too demanding. I literally went to the store my self, and bought me legumes, egg-whites, yogurts and cauli-rice as alternate non-carb sides and was willing to cook them myself, instead of sides of bread, pasta and rice. I would still have all other dishes including the meat main-dish and veggies.

They kept giving indirect reasons for why they are mad, but ultimately it was emotions. They felt like a shared meal is essential to ""a family"" (like they show on movies) and individual meal choices means the ""family is breaking apart""."
