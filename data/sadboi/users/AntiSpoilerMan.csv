HeartHorny,fpwke27,t3_gfgrvx,1588964994.0,"As the other person said, don't overthink this. You got a BJ, and they just hate you now? That sounds kinda like me lol(and I am legilimately very very paranoid when it comes to shit like that). Trust me, some people just don't want to take it too sexual at the early stages of a relationship. She does 100% not hate you, good luck in the future man!"

Crushes,fpwiouk,t1_fpwikq9,1588964140.0,"Meaning, you would confess immediately? Or ask about the homecoming incident"
Crushes,fpwig47,t1_fpwi0nw,1588964016.0,"Huh, that's a difficult one. You could try to start a conversation on ig, and try to start something there? Even that's basically impossible. I don't know any advice, sorry. I guess just try to get on talking terms with her, and confess then? I don't know. Just make sure they don't already have a BF.

Crushes,fi7luz1,t3_f6veri,1582223804.0,"I would recommend to really get to know her first. I would just try to be friends before making any huge moves, so you have overall more of an chance for her to like you (if she doesn't already), and just getting to see if she actually likes you. You have something in common, I would recommend to try to have at least a conversation with her daily, talk about anime or something. I'm not an expert or anything, so still take this with a grain of salt. Good luck!"

There is no force stopping you from dating someone you might consider to be more good-looking than you. If you both have combatible personalities, you'll be as good of an pair as 2 supermodels.
