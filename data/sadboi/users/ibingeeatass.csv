Those morons went up there with their shitty parts expecting to do a shitty job and be done, well not today. I gave my part, which was thorough and nice and then let each of them give theirs. When they failed to cover relevant information I chimed in and asked them questions as though this was all part of the presentation, when they couldn‚Äôt answer I just took over and made them look stupid. The only reason this was possible though was because we were graded individually on our performance and not as a group."
