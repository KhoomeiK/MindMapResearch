The CT showed that it was sitting in my left kidney and was not currently trying to pass, despite me having severe pain and nausea and vomiting. I met with my urologist and she thinks that the pain I’m experiencing is GI issues, but I’ve had many kidney stones before and know the pain when I feel it. I also spoke with my uncle who is a urologist and he said that’s it’s very well possible that my stone could be trying to leave and then bouncing around in my kidney, which causes the severe but intermittent pain that I’m having. I’ve never had a stone this large before so this is all new territory for me as well. I hope this could be of some help to you and good luck with your stone."

I think it’s very generous for any parent to give their kids any kind of money past the age of 18 and I salute you for taking care of all of your children even into adulthood. That being said, I also want to show your daughter some empathy here (which she probably doesn’t deserve). Your ex wife essentially indoctrinated your daughter at a young age into choosing her over you, which is unfortunate. Please know that that’s probably a huge factor into why she dislikes you so much. It probably has nothing to do with you as a father or a human being. Since, she is choosing to not be in your life, you get to choose where your money goes. At the end of the day, she’s made it clear that she doesn’t want you in her life and you owe her absolutely nothing, especially since she’s an adult in her 30’s. I’m sorry that this happened to you OP. Take care of yourself and cherish the moments you have with the rest of your children."

It was the girl behind me in line. She handed me a Kit Kat and left. Either she shook the machine hard enough to get it down or she paid for another to come out.
