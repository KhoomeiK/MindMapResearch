So the “session” consisted of the guy getting erect in front of me, masturbating in front of me, basically “demonstrating”. Then he asked me to give him a handjob. I did, as i was told. Blowjob, thank goodness i didn’t agree to that. I hate to admit it that i did  get a little excited about it, because i was a kid suddenly exposed to a whole new world of stuff. 

All these years later, i’m not gay, although i did think back then. I mean, i was so confused and there was no one to properly guide me then."
