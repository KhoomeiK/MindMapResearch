Tinder,fmpfc0k,t1_fmpdveu,1586279826.0,"lmfao nah. I spend a lot of time on r/menslib which is a community based on men's issues but instead of demonizing third wave feminists it tries its best to find common ground between the two. It's one of the only left leaning subs that tackle men's issues from a non-hateful perspective. 

Men's rights is very right leaning for the most part and tends to have ""Nice guys"" who just don't know how to be nice to girls or really anyone that don't fit their bubble. 

From my point of view, I think it is toxic that men are expected to cater for women. Not only because it emotionally drains a lot of men, but it also disempowers women to be able to have the self confidence when the tables are turned and they are interested in someone and want to make the first move. 

Every girl who has ever messaged me first say ""Hey"" or ""What's up"" which really shows the level of social development they have when they start a conversation instead of it flipped. Which is why when I see ""Make me laugh"" as a bio with no other information, I know immediately that this person expects men to cater to them with no give back. 

So most guys responding are probably putting in a ton of effort to ""Make her laugh"" while she sits back and chooses which guy she likes most. That has underlying social effects on men and on her as a person. Many men feel worthless and unappreciated by these kinds of people. And many women develop a toxic kind of personality where they expect that kind of dynamic to last in a serious relationship. (Which ends up hurting everyone)

composer,fmju5k5,t1_fmjixn5,1586137803.0,"Well there are only 4 of us in a class. And this prof is cancelling class 20 minutes before.

Her excuses include getting composition gigs, overloading herself for the week. (Which means she took too many gigs to teach our class). Forgetting that she has a composition contract due that week. Etc. 

When I brought it up with the department head, he said I should be happy that a sought after composer is teaching this class. But to be honest it seems more like mismanagement of time than being sought after. My other profs in music don't do this. And some of them are Jazz performers/composers working with top dogs in the industry. 

Basically we have an allotted time for class which is 2 hours, once a week. 25% of the time she cancels that class without any notice. And 50% of the time she reschedules make up lessons, or fails to respond to schedule a lesson. 

A little over a month ago, she canceled class, rescheduled with lessons, then didn't respond to any of our lesson time requests, only to cancel lessons later that week (Which was *After* some of the lesson times she suggested for us). Then she canceled the rescheduling of the rescheduled lessons.

I do have one question. Please tell me if you think my professor's explanation for some stuff sounds like bullshit. 

So. My future professor is also the head of department for our school. Which means he have to do a lot of different meetings with the dean and assistant dean. I recently had problems with my current class comp professor. Essentially my prof was cancelling class all the time. And we only met once a week for 2.5 hours so one cancelled class meant that we had to schedule lessons out of our week. 

Im sure you know, music majors are BUSY. and 2.5 hours is a ton of time to schedule out in a single block during the day. My prof cancelled class 3 separate times in one semester. I emailed my future prof and told him about it. I also mentioned how my class comp prof would give us almost no notice for class cancelling. 

When I met with him, his explanation was that I should ""Feel lucky"" that my profs are busy and are getting gigs outside of class. And that it means that my instruction is at a high level. He said that there will be sometimes when I am working with him that I will have to reschedule because he will have to meet with the dean or other faculty for his position as department head. Essentially his thing was that as long as the credits were getting fulfilled, it shouldn't matter about the professionalism. So that means according to him, my prof could cancel class every single week, requiring me to schedule lessons with her outside of the allotted class time.

Is that legal?"

It certainly seems like that is the implicit claim. Or that the people on this sub are inherently going to drift that way if they become a composer. And I don't think that reflects the world outside of academia today. 

My point is that in the scope of composition, requiring western theory notation to accompany all pieces seems to restrict the ability of this sub to explore the facets of composition effectively.

I myself usually use music notation software. But having ""r/composer"" bar posts without western notation available with it, makes it very restricting on the definition and the scope of this sub. 

Incredible composers like Jacob Collier, Tennyson, DuckSauce to name a few don't use any sort of notation for the vast majority of their works. As for Jacob Collier, there is a person on Reddit and Youtube who literally spends 20+ hours a week transcribing his stuff. And I doubt any person on this sub would claim that Jacob Collier's work wouldn't be immensely beneficial to explore and learn from, even without a score.

Music composition is moving way past traditional timbres and it is getting more and more geared towards production and electronic timbres as time moves on. I think it would be great for r/composer to let these people share their stuff without needing a score. 

""Piano Roll"" can be just as useful for seeing theory and compositional style as western notation. Even seeing the tracks on a daw and how a person layered effects can very much help with composition. It's not impossible to take that same mindset of ""tweak this for this purpose"" and apply it to DAWs and other styles. 

Additionally, people who do things like film and video game composition are writing specifically for a film or video game medium. So to listen to the score alone without some visuals can easily take away from what the person is trying to convey."
composer,fm6cr4c,t3_ft3uka,1585791193.0,"Can you please clarify? Idk what the hell is going on. Are you saying that positing scores is going to get you banned? 

I guess I'm just lost. Either way. I don't understand what the big fuss over having a score vs. not having a score is. You can certainly compose without using music theory or having a score. To say that people are not composing if they don't use traditional western notation is simply disingenuous considering how flexible western notation has been."

For example, allowing people to have different beliefs on controversial topics such as being Trans. Jordan Peterson is probably the best example.

Christianity,flwmvr5,t1_flshzig,1585556800.0,"I can clarify. My point is that religious people continuing to meet puts themselves and other people at risk. I find it deeply saddening when people put themselves or others at risk from a place of ignorance. 

When people hurt others on purpose I feel a mix anger instead of sorrow in a way. Right now I would say that is where I am at. Because I consider suffering caused by ""Willful Ignorance"" hurting someone else on purpose. Mostly because someone is making an active choice to remain ignorant and reject truth, while also causing pain to other human beings. It may come from ignorance, but that ignorance is chosen. 

But you are misled on nature ""Taking it's course"". Yes, this virus will display natural selection. But since complex society and democracy has been invented by humans, the ""natural selection"" suffered by the animal kingdom no longer has as large of a hold on who lives and who dies. Amputees, people with Autism or Anemia can grow up perfectly comfortable in western society. And they can succeed and easily pass on their genes compared to only a few hundred years ago. 

Consider this. Coronavirus only has a 2% average fatality rate. And it's even lower (0.02%) for young healthy people. But for the old and immunocompromised, its is in the 10-20% range. So no. Not everyone will be dead who go to church. In fact, the odds are that more people who aren't going to that specific church will die compared to the ones that go. If you are going out and meeting in person on purpose, chances are you aren't old or immunocompromised. That means the most pain felt will be to the people you potentially spread coronavirus to. 

Thats my issue right now. Not ideology, not age, not beliefs, I am worried about the vulnerable of this country who will literally die if given this disease. Even further, I'm worried about the normally healthy people that will die if they have an emergency and hospitals are overrun and cannot treat them.

What I see from these churches is that the pastors talk more about expressing religious liberty, protecting religious freedoms, collecting money, etc. Than they do ""God's Will"". Also, they seem very very eager to talk to news outlets describing how much ""Faith"" their church has in God. 

When challenged, they go from a legalistic perspective saying not meeting at church is an attack on the constitution and the first amendment. I see a lot more talk of that from these church goer's and members than I see what you described above.

Christianity,flsjn07,t1_fls7dzc,1585443633.0,Aaaaand there we have the unwillingness to talk about your beliefs because I do not share them. Literally saw it coming from a mile away lol
Christianity,fls2gn5,t1_fls1g8w,1585432943.0,"I already knew you were going to make this argument. This is the argument from authority. You are equating a place of power and ""Who"" you transgressed to a different level of punishment. 

If you steal/defraud a million dollars from a billionaire, should you be punished any less than if you stole a million dollars from a multi millionaire?  Does the amount matter? Or who you stole from?

If you kill a homeless man, should your punishment be worse than if you kill the president? 

If you really want to talk about justice, talk about the actual crime. Not who you are committing it against. Under your reasoning, stealing from the billionaire should result in me being punished more because they are more powerful than stealing from the millionaire. 

I think this is inherently fallible. That kind of thinking means people can do what they wish and decree what they wish simply because they have the power. But power does not equal right, and it does not equal truth."
Christianity,fls24lv,t1_fls1pzj,1585432738.0,"I mean, according to Christian theology you are absolutely correct"
Christianity,fls23t1,t1_fls1tjl,1585432725.0,I don't follow
Christianity,fls226d,t3_fqsvq4,1585432697.0,"You need to realize that for one you aren't accountable to any potential person's expectations of you. 

If you find someone in life in a few years or weeks or days that is insecure about you not being a virgin, then they have personal issues they have got to deal with. Sex is not about ""Performing"". It isn't something to be compared to with someone else. And if your partner cannot trust you because you aren't a virgin then that means their mentality of sex is that it is something that he must compete with. 

To clarify, if your partner sees sex as simply an emotional connection, and something you feel that you want to do with someone you love or feel attracted to, then they will not worry about your past history. They will love you for you and not wish you were anything different."
Christianity,fls1qir,t1_flrzbrv,1585432501.0,"I agree. If your future partner is insecure because you aren't a virgin, that's their problem and they have to take that up. It isn't OP's job to protect a future spouse from insecurities from something they did in the past. People come from all walks in life."
Christianity,fls02dt,t1_flrqqcj,1585431493.0,"I never said that the greatest utility for Christians is that no one suffers. I in fact never even used the words utility, or even suffering. You are projecting what you want me to mean, so you can knock it down. That is a straw man. 

Who says Christians cannot gather on a livestream? Who says Christians can't do a group Skype call for God's glory? I though y'all believed your God was all powerful. I'm pretty sure his glory wouldn't be restricted by technology? 

""For when two or three are gathered in his name, I am with them"" -Matthew 18:20. That snippet alone dismantles any reason to meet in groups larger than 10 for any religious reason whatsoever.  

Can people not gather on a livestream? Can people not gather on the phone? Over the computer? On a Tablet? Can people not gather 6 feet apart? 

The real reason these pastors are meeting is for a selfish preservation of ""Religious Liberty"". They are misinformed and truly believe that their PERSONAL religious freedom is at stake, which then causes them to take actions against the government and against people who are vulnerable. When you really boil down this issue, there is no scriptural support for meeting in groups larger than ten to experience God's glory. 

On top of this, you have megachurch pastors continuing to ask for donations despite the fact that people are out of work. Interesting that tax free building and wages can't sit back awhile to wait this out...

To go even further, you claiming that Christians needing to be able to experience God's glory through meeting in large groups (Without even a smidgen of adequate biblical support) puts people who are not Christian at risk to get sick and die. Jesus himself said that people who do not provide and care for the sick will have no place with him in heaven"" no? 

Part of taking care of the sick right now is a radical life change so that hospitals won't get overrun. But noooooo. People still have to go expose themselves to thousands of others every sundry because they are too lazy to do a livestream. That is simply ignorance, entitlement, carelessness, and selfishness at the highest level."
atheism,flrbik0,t1_flqofjy,1585416874.0,With extremist pastors I would absolutely agree with you. People like cult leaders usually don't believe in their own message.
atheism,flq5ksp,t1_flq4zos,1585380016.0,"I understand this. But Atheists like Stalin were capable of turning people's inability to think for themselves against them. The thing is, this man was not a good person but he wasn't Stalin. In his own way he was also subjugated to the Republican Party. 

I don't agree with his message. But I have more compassion for his church and family than I do hate for this man. But in this thread I see only hate instead of some empathy for his family and poeple deceived."
Christianity,flq3vb3,t1_flpxyhw,1585378082.0,"Lol I actually like this. As an Atheist I find the concept of eternal punishment for finite crime morally unjustifiable. But it still does show that ""Buffet Christianity"" is very very misleading."
ForeverAloneDating,flq3fma,t1_flpxwoi,1585377598.0,Chill out dude. We're all here looking for the same thing
