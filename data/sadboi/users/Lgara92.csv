Gastritis,fprx6vn,t3_gcgs7j,1588863733.0,"If you don't see a counselor or therapist, I would start there. I have a cyclical effect with gastrointestinal issues and anxiety/depression. Basically I don't know which causes which, but they make each other way worse. 

There is a nerve that connects your gut to your brain and is in direct connection with your levels of seratonin. When one is off balance, it messes with the whole body. Unfortunately a lot of doctors don't understand yet how important this connection is. 

I've never taken ppis for my gastritis but have learned how to manage it when it flares up. Ppis are problematic because the reduction of stomach acid can allow bacterial to get into your small intestine and cause SIBO. My doctor has me taking probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes and zinlori to repair the gut. My counselor has me on Zoloft with hydroxyzine as needed.

When I take the anxiety medication, it helps my stomach issues and my anxiety. I hope some of this information helps."

raisedbyborderlines,fo05jxj,t3_g4vsmh,1587406461.0,"I'm sorry you struggle with this. That is so unfortunate that your mother didn't let you have your own feelings. It makes for difficulty bonding emotionally with others. 

I'm a little different. My borderline was a neglectful mother who I saw seldom and when I did it was all about her. She constantly needed praise or she'd be faking suicide attempts to get attention. If I ever tried to express my feelings to her, she would become mean and vicious. I would literally go over a year without hearing from her because I didnt give her what she wanted. She could throw me away like trash and did. 

My other borderline parent was my stepmom who I lived with for 10 years. She was the controlling type who didn't let me express myself without later twisting my words. She would be kind and empathetic in the moment, but later would spin my insecurities and feelings to be something else completely. It's hard to understand, but if you've experienced it, you know. She would tell me I was an ungrateful child and would scream constantly. To this day if someone raises their voice in an argument, I start shaking. 

My issue that I struggle with is feeling guilty after expressing myself. Guilt and shame we're feelings I learned to associate with sharing, so it has taken a lot of time to undo the damage. I have learned how to have healthy relationships with my friends and my husband, but I still struggle with my dad (my mom and stepmom are no longer in my life). 

My dad constantly will back pedal and say I had a normal childhood and my stepmom did so many good things for me. I've had to learn recently to put a boundary down with him and walk away when he gets like that. It is really hard to undo the damage a borderline does and I feel your pain. 

One day, you will be able to let someone in emotionally and it will feel good, not bad. I'm so sorry she did that to you. You deserve better. I hope you can get some comfort from this. Good luck!"

Anxiety,fne6hal,t3_g17rd8,1586883906.0,"I get nightmares all the time. If it's not a nightmare, it's a lower level stress dream, like I'm late to something, I'm fired from my job or I'm missing an article of clothing. 

My nightmares are usually centered around my childhood home where I delt with emotional abuse and gaslighting. In the dreams, I'm stuck in the house again with my abusive parents and can't figure out how to leave. 

It's funny because in the dream, I'm married to my husband but for some reason living in my childhood home and that all seems normal lol

My therapist says it is stress or fear that has not been addressed to the fullest extent. For example, I'm not in that situation and I have solid boundaries with my parents, but still feel fear to express myself to them. It's something I'm working on, but comes out in my dreams.

Anxiety,fmp4cik,t3_fwm9rl,1586274195.0,"I wouldn't say it is unusual to do that every once and a while. Like once a month is probably pretty normal. If you spend almost every night doing this though, that is something to work on. It sounds like you struggle with embarrassment or fear of judgement. I used to be really bad about it, like if I said something that came across stupid or insensitive, I would apologize to that person, but I didn't forgive myself for it. I just replayed in my head how dumb it was. 

An old co-worker gave me the best advice about this. She said, no one is paying that much attention to you. It sounded mean at first but what she meant was, everyone else is so in their own head and worried about themselves that they probably will forget the dumb thing you said or did. 

It's like when you are nervous to give a speech in class. You are so afraid of messing up or everyone looking at you, but in reality, everyone else in the class is focused on being nervous themselves. 

Not sure if this is helpful, but maybe in time you won't be so critical of yourself."

Anxiety,fljv9a0,t3_fpanx2,1585227510.0,"I'm sorry you are going through this. It is really scary and I understand why you are anxious. 

There are other coping techniques to help with anxiety besides cutting. What cutting really is, is an outlet to feel control and to release the intense emotions. Other things that can help you feel in control are:
- Creating lists of scenarios; organizing your thoughts on paper is calming; write out all of the scenarios of what could happen from her having the virus, to her being fine. Having a game plan can put a level of control back in your hands and grounds you to reality, not just what ifs 

- Cleaning your surroundings; this seems silly but when I am overwhelmed, I stop what I am doing and organize my area. It doesn't solve my problems, but it keeps me from feeling helpless and it is visually pleasing

- make something that your family can use. You can sew face masks, create your own soap, etc. This is creative and proactive 

- this is a big one- when you feel calm and happy again, make a list of things that make you feel better. It is really hard to think of things that make you happy when you feel shitty, so this is your cheat sheet. Mine includes looking at memes I have shared with my sister, watching scary movie 3 (my favorite comedy), looking at my collection of art from highschool, watching my playlist of dumb vines. 

Also remember this feeling will pass and you will feel so much better. You will get through this!"

You ask about when the apocalypse happens, but I think our Hollywood version of apocalypse is misleading. People will get sick and some people will die. Unfortunately that is our reality right now. Rather than letting that information create fear, use it to be smart. Wash your hands after every public interaction. Take precautions. Stay away from elderly to keep them safe.

Personally I don't foresee us in the us to have to farm and fish to survive, but those are good skills to have. It doesn't hurt. It sounds like your parents are trying their best to keep you safe and self sufficient. Having something we can control, like gardening, helps keep anxiety at Bay. Please try not to be scared by everything. It is certainly overwhelming, but we will get through it. Remember this is all temporary and you will get back to a normal life. We are all in this together.

One was a $900 bill that I talked down to $500. The other was $2,000 that I got down to $1,400. 

I had to put alot of my medical expenses on credit cards because the testing I need is not covered by the insurance I pay for. Definitely get those cards out of the way first.

My husband and I planned on trying for a baby in 2020 and all of my focus to get better was on that goal. I am not 100% normal yet. I still have stomach issues and am on Zoloft, but within the last couple of months, it hit me that I don't need to be at that goal.

I did go to a genetics specialist who said I was fine to try, along with my gyno. It really reassured me that I would be okay to move forward without fear of my health complications. 

I was sick of putting my life on hold for my illness so I started just saying fuck it and decided I'm going to try even if my body isn't exactly where I want it to be. I made that goal of getting pregnant so important that I wasn't living in the present. I am much happier now that I gave up control on the situation. 

My husband and I are officially starting to try in March and have discussed if I were to get sick, how we would handle it. 

Don't give up! You will feel better. Accomplish small goals in the meantime until you feel confident enough. For me, I had a goal to read one book a month and passed it. I also work on my house, like painting and fixing up stuff. It helps to have things keeping you happy in the present rather than focusing on that which is out of your control."

MTHFR,f7yz6rc,t1_f7ymduj,1574102899.0,"So last year I became very ill right after my wedding. There were signs in the previous year that I was developing intolerances, like bloating after eating Chipotle or drinking a beer, weird light-headedness every once and a while, not sweating when running, but feeling like I was going to pass out, and being hung over after drinking for multiple days, but they were minor so I didn't think much of them. 
Well in October I had a Halloween party where I had alot of high fat Carby foods. Buffalo chicken dip, pizza,  chips, and two coke and rum drinks. I was sick for multiple days after this. I ended up at the emergency room because I was non-stop shaking, couldn't eat, had burning pain, and was dehydrated. I was diagnosed with gastritis. 
My older sister had been treated for leaky gut and was on her own recovery. She had already been seeing this functional doctor and I went to him right away. We did a stool test, breath test and DNA test. The stool test revealed a bacterial imbalance which led to me taking proper probiotics. The DNA testing showed a comt mutation and a mthfr mutation. My older sister had the same mutations and recently discovered that she has MCAS.  Her illness also started with gastrointestinal issues. The gastritis also created intense anxiety. I was already on Zoloft for depression and began taking venlafaxine.

Anxiety,f7dhn1e,t3_dvll1q,1573617066.0,"It's a steppingstone in your career and will help prepare you for your next position. Sorry you'll be working under someone who stresses you out. That certainly would makes me nervous. I don't know if you need to hear this but you are doing a great job and should be proud.

An exercise that helps me with anxiety is taking a scenario and writing out all the positive and negative outcomes that are possible. Then further write how you would handle that outcome if it were to happen. It's a good grounding technique that helps me feel in control. It helps to remove the unknown which tends to be the source of anxiety."
Anxiety,f2v5379,t1_f2v1ki3,1570446058.0,"Yeah you definitely have alot to balance and maybe are stretching yourself too thin. It's okay to not be perfect or anything close to it. I used to struggle with ""should"" thoughts. Like I should be cleaning my house, I should have started this research paper, I should have said this in that conversation. 

It is an easy habit to fall into, and on the surface it appears like a good way to motivate yourself but it really is self criticism. Everytime you have a should thought, you are subconsciously telling yourself you aren't good enough. 

For me, I had to pause when I had a should thought and turned it into a question of ""will doing this thing make me happy or am I putting unnecessary stress on myself?"" 

I struggle with control myself, mainly with family relationships. It sucks, but it definitely can get better with reframing your thoughts into healthy and supportive ones. Also, do something that genuinely makes you happy, for you. Self care is really important. Call off a day of work if you need to for a mental health day and just be alone. It's okay to take a day off for you. You are important."
Anxiety,f2rdas7,t3_de3s9b,1570372105.0,"What are your other relationships with your family like? Would you say you are content in all other areas of your life? Sometimes, when we feel out of control (like having an unsupportive family or abusive friend) we project our need for control on our SO. 

Do you have any history of depression? Is this a new situation for you? 

I had a situation where I was dating a guy who was really great, sweet, and a good boyfriend. After six months of dating I started getting anxiety attacks when I would see him or if we were alone. We were in school at the time and he never tried anything untoward. 

It took a long time to realize that when he and I were dating, I was living in an incredibly toxic home with my parents. Not having control over anything else in my life was projected onto him. I think it was because I couldn't handle the emotions and was overwhelmed. 

Maybe this will help you realize you aren't alone. If you have been together long enough that you trust one another, open up and talk to her about it. May the anxiety of not wanting her to know is making it worse."

I appreciate the advice :)"
Anxiety,f1cu4e5,t3_d8ustz,1569365921.0,"Sometime last year I went about a week without my Zoloft due to being ungodly sick. It was hell because I was without coffee, Zoloft and was puking and shaky. 

I know the situation is different. What helped me was watching my favorite movies, getting caught up on a show, reading, memes. I had friends spend time with me so I wasn't lonely. I tried to sleep alot too. 

If you get real low, try reminding yourself that this is temporary. That is my mantra whenever I feel low. I keep telling myself it will pass and I will feel better again. 

Medically, cbd oil helps. If you have a doctor and need something urgently, they can get you Xanax for emergencies. That way if you start to spiral, it will calm your body down. It helped for me just to know it was there as a safety net. I'm sorry you're going through this. It will be okay!"
Anxiety,f1cigws,t1_f1cdawl,1569358273.0,Thank you!
Anxiety,f1cig9g,t1_f1cd2jq,1569358263.0,"I think in time she may need them. Mental illness runs in our family. My parents did put her on birth control because she has a hormone imbalance and that has helped a bit. I myself have been on Zoloft for about 3 years and I am weening off expressor (with my pysch). I do feel so much better knowing she sees her counselor every week. As long as that continues, I think she will be okay. 

I agree that my dad is being unfair. It's just something I have to accept, rather than try to change. I have learned how to put up a boundary with him and keep my distance when I am upset. It just sucks to watch my sister go through the same thing. 

Thanks, I appreciate it. Now I just have to work on self care habits."
Anxiety,f1c94e8,t1_f1c67zq,1569352647.0,I see what you mean. Having an intense confrontation can show him how serious I am. I will have to think about it. It is definitely something I'll talk to my counselor about.
Anxiety,f1c07p3,t1_f1by7qn,1569346948.0,"You hit the nail on the head. He is super guilty. That is why he is in denial. He actually told me once that he would rather the issue be that my little sister is manipulative, than her actually being suicidal. That told me right there, he can't accept that reality. He doesn't want it to be true, so it isn't. 

I have in the past tried to show him research and we've shared articles on narcissists, so I know to some extent he agrees. Same with my sister's mental health. He just isn't consistent. It is really mind-blowing how he flip flops so much. Also if I try to share my own research on it, sometimes he feels like I am attaching him. It is a mind fuck trying to convince him of anything. 

The thing is he loves his kids so much. He raised my older sister and myself when our mom walked out. He also took custody of my younger brother and sister to give them a more stable home. He would do anything in the physical sense for his kids. But he is a damaged person. He is still living under his ex wife's thumb and feels like he can't make a decision without upsetting someone. 

This article about enabling fathers is actually pretty spot on. http://parenting.exposed/enabling-partner-of-a-narcissist-parent/

Even though he is no longer married to the nar., He still is trying to keep the peace and not upset her. Unfortunately by doing that, he is invalidating his children and putting the blame on their shoulders. I swear I could write a book, it is so complex. 😓"
Anxiety,f1bwtzj,t1_f1btx86,1569344749.0,"That is part of the problem. He has never gone to counseling after their divorce. He is pretty arrogant about physcology because he went through a church to get his ""psych degree"" over twenty years ago.

He does get involved with my sister's counselor and participates in family counseling. He just isn't consistent enough with it. And if I try to share my thoughts, even very calmly using ""I feel like"" statements, he can get defensive and upset that I would question his parenting. Some days he does listen and agrees with me, other days he shuts down and ignores the problem."
Anxiety,f1bwh7d,t1_f1buo2j,1569344518.0,"Thank you so much, it really helps to feel supported. My dad normally is more logical but he tends to be inconsistent. One day he agrees that her mother is the problem, but then he'll tell me they talked and he believe my sister was manipulating him. He tries to rationalize but her behavior isn't rational. 

She isn't on any medication, as her counselor believes she can solves these issue without it. I agree, she is too young to go on antidepressants, and that won't fix the issue of her mother. 

I will keep sending her memes and try to not focus on the negatives. Thank you again :)"
Gastritis,f0igzb6,t1_f0idplc,1568641596.0,"Yeah I guess it's a lifestyle change, but at least it pushes me to eat healthy. I think the symptoms were worse for me because I have some gene mutations that contributed. 
My biggest concern now is being healthy enough to get pregnant. It's a whole other obstacle, but I'm determined to make it work. 

I get the false positives too of feeling like I'm good again but then a week later everything makes me bloat. Lol. 

I'd still suggest looking into some probiotics if you aren't on any. I hope you can find the right relief."
Gastritis,f0gnmeo,t1_f0gifxu,1568602795.0,"So for a while I would have issues with bloating after eating but didn't think much of it. It mainly was with really salty or greasy foods and I avoided them alot. Then I went to my bachelorette party and drank so much I blacked out. I was hungover for three days but figured I just over did it. Then at my wedding a few weeks later I was sick for a couple of days but thought I had food poisoning. Just body aching and stomach discomfort. Some puking. 

When I realized what was really happening was after a Halloween party a month after my wedding. I had a rum and coke, pizza, buffalo chicken dip, basically bad greasy foods. Well I ended up being sick for a whole week, throwing up, stomach burning, body shaking all over, unable to eat or sleep. That's when I knew something was terribly wrong. 

I was so sick I went to the emergency room where they gave me an anti nausea medication and two ppis. I stopped taking them after two days because my symptoms worsened and I went to urgent Care twice that week. I found out my antidepressant was poorly conflicting with the anti nausea. They told me to stop eating and stop all medications for a few days.

It took a couple of weeks before I could eat full meals again.  After that incident I went to a functional medicine gi that my sister had been going to. She actually had sibo and leaky gut which turned into Mass Cell Activation Syndrome. He had me get a stool test, a dna test and blood work. 

Eat month for up to a week at a time, I would miss work because I had stomach spams. Basically I couldn't eat because my stomach was twisting and hurt. I would nonstop shake, up my whole body.  I could only get myself to eat plain white rice on a good day. I also developed a physical anxiety that was causing suicidal thoughts. I woke up with dread and that anxious sinking feeling. Up to this point I had been in counseling for about three years and was already great at treating my depression. I know now that the anxiety was a physical manifestation as a result of the imbalance. Your gut is directly connected to the vagus nerve which travels to your brain.  It took probably 6 months before I was really in a normal rhythm and diet as well as a healthy mental state. 

I still have to watch what I eat and stick mostly to the gluten and dairy free diet. Yeah it's a pain in the ass, but it's worth having energy and feeling like myself. My bacterial imbalance isn't completely gone, but that takes time. It is so much more manageable and I feel like I have control over my life again. 

I hope this helps you. Even if the symptoms aren't exactly the same, I know it sucks to be in that situation."
Gastritis,f0dct78,t3_d4hsa3,1568552475.0,"I was diagnosed with gastritis last year. I have been seeing a functional medicine doctor and my treatment has been with the use of probiotics, prebiotics and other supplements like digestive enzymes. We did a stool test which revealed a bacterial imbalance in the gut. An endoscopy showed inflammation in the small intestine. 

I haven't taken any ppis at all and have been successfully treating myself. The gastritis was so bad last year, I was missing work for a week every month and lost 15 lbs. Now I haven't missed a day since January and can eat a fairly normal diet again. Did cut out gluten and dairy which helped."

Do you have holistic options? Or functional medicine? I have gastritis and see a functional doctor. If you have access to Amazon, there are some supplements you can try for healing the lining of your stomach. Here are some that have helped me.

Personally, I had to cut out gluten and dairy and that helped alot. Maybe there are things you can try without your doctor. Also can you ask your doctor for a probiotic? Even if they think you have a mental disorder, I don't see why they would deny you a probiotic"
Gastritis,ezee007,t3_d0v3su,1567862653.0,"That is incredibly unprofessional of your doctor. Find a new one who understands how gastritis actually works. If you have gastritis, you will often have acid going up your esophagus even when you can't feel it. That happens from a variety of things. Anxiety, stress, eating something too acidic, eating a trigger food. Sorry you were treated that way. Some doctors are assholes."

Gastritis,ey6bhuo,t1_ey60uyq,1566851768.0,"I didn't have diarrhea, but alot of things would cause me to bloat and belch. I had alot of abdominal discomfort that turned into stomach spasms and burning pain. 

I don't know enough about the science behind it, I'm sorry. I just know what I was diagnosed with and what has helped. I didn't actually have h pylori. There are many different types. I will get my paperwork and show an example of what I mean."
Gastritis,ey430y9,t3_cve69b,1566780447.0,"You could try a stool test to see if you have a bacterial imbalance. Those can cause gastritis and it could help you figure out what probiotic or supplement you should take to treat it. 

I had an endoscopy that found minor irritation and was diagnosed with gastritis. My GI had me take a stool test that revealed what bacteria was too high vs too low and what shouldn't be there at all. I also cut out alcohol, gluten and dairy. For a while just had safe foods like plain rice and bananas until my stomach was consistently calm. 

Any doctor will need notes and food journal tracking. Try it out for a couple of weeks and see if you can find correlations. Also, I ate pretty healthy before I developed this. Never smoked, drank on occasion. I speculate that it was from unresolved trauma, with the right stress at the right time. Idk. 

The more information from testing you have, the better to narrow down what it is. Maybe try one option for a bit and rule out if it is or isn't gastritis. Then move onto the next theory. 

For the nausea, ginger candy is a life saver."

I also did a stool sample with my doctor and found that I had bacteria imbalances that contributed to the anxiety. Too much of a ""bad"" bacteria showed one of the side effects being anxiety. 

Don't know if any of this is helpful, but I have similar issues with gastritis and anxiety. Just wanted to share what has worked for me."
