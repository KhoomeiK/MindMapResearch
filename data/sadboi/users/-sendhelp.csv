I can't be responsible for death! I can't sit here and watch him kill himself or someone else! That is wrong. 

Do not call me naive. I am young, yes, but I have been through so much more than just this. I have held mine and others lives in my own hands for the majority of my life. So, do not call me naive. I know exactly what will happen if I leave, and I know what mine or his actions will lead to.

He owns weapons, I have the images and I google-reversed searched them to make sure they are real. They are real. Those are his photos and weapons. 

I have his full name and I know the whereabouts of where he lives. I have photos from around there, so I could probably find out more precisely if I tried. 

I don't have an address and my family life isn't the best, so I don't know what to do. I am scared he will kill himself or someone else. He told me he would have no remorse in doing so."

I have many screenshots saved, but I'm not sure who to go to as we live far away and I will have all my devices (needed for school and quarantine) taken away by my parents if they find out I was in contact with a stranger. 

I really don't know who to take it to. My home life is not very good. 

I already have really bad anxiety, and this is just making it worse. I am trying to be strong, but it's really, really scary knowing I hold the life of another individual in my hands and only mine."

I can't report him because we live in different states, and I'm so worried he will kill himself first."

I'm trying to let it go in case they come back again, but it's just so horrible to watch them hurt people I love and me, and then get away scott-free.

The only recent 2 week ban I heard of was for a horrible troll. Quora is really messed-up though and their Moderation doesn't work well. 

1. You can respect the BNBR and hope to not stand out. You can also appeal a ban. 
2. Yes. There are a lot of trolls on the site that sort of ruin the experience. 
3. You can appeal the ban, or delete your account and make a new one."

I hate the fact that people will come up to people like us and tell that we're so lucky, even though we struggle with so many things. 

I get what you mean. I'm so much luckier than so many people, but I can't believe that *this* is the life I got, that this is what I'm going to have to deal with."

After going to a party, I can't face the rest of the world for days. 

Because of this feeling with all kinds of people, I don't think it has to do with incompatibility, more of just trouble with socialization in general. 

Remember to take time exclusively to yourself, and focus on your needs, and I think that you feel a bit better with socialization with others. If you separate your time between yourself and your friends, keeping it equal, I think you could feel a lot better."
