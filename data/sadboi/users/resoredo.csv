de,fqn13tf,t1_fqmuyuw,1589486899.0,"Zentrismus geht immer mit dem Trope von ""Hear both Sides/Both Sides are kinda right/Both sides are wrong"". Deswegen klappt das Extrembeispiel so gut, weile s für die meisten verständlich ist. Bei Feminismus und Frauenthemen ist es halt aus verschiedenen Gründen schwieriger (hab dazu, auch in diesem Thread, einige Sachen geschrieben die das Thema aufgreifen). Ich versuchs kurz und prägnant zu halten (auch weil ich schon müde bin und zu viel getippt hab).

>Fand die Sendung okay, finde aber auch die Kritik okay.

Kann man, wenn man extrem bzw schwarz-weiß sein möchte, zentristisch sehen, ist es aber nicht (auch dazu paar Sachen in anderen Kommentaren).

Warum man aber man sowas bzw so eine Aussage, ohne detailierte Betreachtung, zentristisch sehen kann (was ich persönlich nicht tue):

Wenn wir wieder zu den Tropes zurück kehren, kann/könnte man das so lesen und extrapolieren (wo sie normalerweise dann auch hingehen).

1. \-> Die Seiten der Frauen ist ja ganz okays, aber was ist mit der anderen Seite der Männer (oder plakativ, der Täter). -> Das was die Frauen sagen kann man so nicht ganz für bare Münze nehmen, schließlich kennt man die andere Seite nicht. -> Ich glaube das ist nicht die ganze Wahrheit, ich bleib da kritisch -> Ich glaub das alles nicht, aber ich trau mich nicht das zu sagen.
2. \-> Klar ist das alles schwer für Frauen, aber als Mann weiß man nun auch nicht mehr was man machen darf und soll. (""Chivalry is dead"") -> Es ist halt schon schwer zu verstehen wann man was sagen darf oder tun kann -> Ich bin nicht schuld, ich hab einfach falsche Signale bekommen -> Sie ist selber schuld
   1. *ODER, eine Alternation dazu ist* \-> Ja aber nicht alle Männer sind so/ Männer haben auch Probleme (*Geht aber wieder Richtung Whataboutism, was auch wider Zentrimus ist)*

Nummer 3 funktioniert hier nicht ganz, wenn dann gibt es eher die ""Women are wrong on this topic tho"".

Das Problem mit Zentrimus ist halt dass das Bekennen und Akzeptieren der Probleme nicht passiert, damit man ""neutral"" bleibt. Der Krux ist aber, dass man bei klassischen zentristischen Themen nicht neutral bleiben kann, und wenn man das möchte, wird man zum Enabler by Default. Da man nicht dagegen tut, unterstüztz man das ganze durch Nicht-Aktion. Mit Zentrimus wird Differenziertheit  vorgespielt und Nuancen in ein Thema gebracht, aber eigentlich wird eben die eigene Nicht-Aktion oder sogar Befürwortung kaschiert. (Was nciht heißt das es keine Nuancen gibt, und das ist wichtig diese auszuzeigen - aber wenn man den Nuancen mehr Raum eingibt als es eigentlich verdient hätte, und dabei den offensichtlichen Sachen den Spotlight raubt, macht man sich dem Zentrismus schuldig).

Klassisch ist Vergewaltigung von Frauen und das vollkommene Abtun von dieser Tatsache durch ""Statistiken"" über Fake Rape Allegations oder das Männer auch vergewaltigt werden. Die Nuance ist: ""Ja Männer werden auch vergewaltigt, warum wird nciht drüber geredet"" und ""Ja, es gibt Frauen die falsche Vorwürfe machen"". Aber das ändert nix daran das es sehr viele Vergewaltigungen gibt, Frauen meistens die Opfer sind, usw. All diese Premisen dürfen gleichzeitig valide sein, und sind gleichzeitig valide. Aber wenn man den Nuancen mehr Raum gibt (proportional) oder mit diesen Nuancen das Hauptproblem zur Seite fegt oder devalidiert, dann gibts Schwierigkeiten.

Und von solchen Zentrismus-Aussagen gibt es viel zu viele, wenn es um Themen wie Frauenrechte, Frauenprobleme, Geschlechterforschung gibt usw. Und es ist halt auch sehr sneaky, weil man mit solchen Tropes nicht direkt dagegen argumentiert, aber unterschwellig Dissens vermittelt, ohne sich dabei wirklich angreifbar zu machen oder offen zu positionieren. Also einfach Feigheit.

In dem Zitat und im Artikel ist eine valide Kritik - aber das Video wird ja trotzdem für zumindestens okay befunden. Hier ist kein Zentrismus mMn

Andererseits: Medizinische Studien machen ja genau das - möglichst viele verschiedene Menschen mit verschiedenen gesundheitlichen Backgrounds untersuchen und Wirkmechanismen von Stoffen identifizieren bzw. isolieren. Ist eine Heidenarbeit, deswegen ist das ganze auch so teuer. Das Geld gibts aber halt nciht für Geschlechterforschung, Psychologie und Soziologie. Ist halt auch nicht so sexy und annerkannt im Mainstream weil die wenigsten Menschen drauf stehen wenn ihre eigenen Biases, Ansichten und Meinungen identifiziert und ""angegriffen"" werden - und in vielen Fällen ihr persönliches Fundament in Gefahr ist (wie bei Rechtsnationalen und der Tatsacche das es mehr rechte Gewalt gibt als die anderen plakatierten Gefahren).

Und bei all dem darf man halt nicht vergessen offen zu bleiben, den Menschen nicht zu vergessen und auch den Dialog zu suchen (wenn einer den möglich ist). Es ghet nicht um Anfeidung sondern um Sichtbarkeit. Und grad marginalisierte Gruppen sind wenig sichtbar. ABer man wird nie für diese Gruppen eine Lösung oder Hilfe bieten können, wenn man schon am Grundkonzept scheitert (hier eben zb die Benachteiligung von Weißen Frauen - auch wenn es vermutlich anderen Frauengruppen noch schwerer haben).

Wir alle haben unsere Filterbubble, ob wir wollen oder nicht. Und wenn man uns aus dieser Komfortzone herauszieht wird es unangenehm und für viele auch nicht aushaltbar. Kognitive DIssonanz und Selbstschutz halt.

Im wissenschaftlichen Bereich wird intersektional gearbeitet - nicht nur in der Geschlechterforschung, auch in Medizin, Psychologie, Psychotherapie und Soziologie/Ökonmie. Ist halt nicht einfach.

What you describe is true and shitty, but it still stems from gender roles.

Detransions happen and are very problematic, but like all conditions and illnesses, there is no perfect solution or 'cure'. 

The number of detransions is very small. Mayor reason for detrans are not being able to pass, botched surgeries, not enough medical care and information beforehand, reckless doctors and misinformed views about the intended gender/sex. Especially the first reason is interesting.

 The common themes are bullying and ostracism from society because of non passing  or/and a very narrow or 'wrong' definition of gender/sex by patients (i.e. 'I can't get there, reaching my definition of the other gender/sex, I failed so I'll just get back to 'normal' and try to live like that). Especially the last one leads to suicide or self harm. But both stem from the same reason which is hegemonial normativity and patriarchal structures. 

(Spoiler: This is very superficial and more complicated than that, it's not really 'The Patriarchy' but I like getting my downvotes. If you really interested I can shoot you some information/reading matsrial/studies, whatever you prefer.

Transgender suicides are still because of dysphoria; information  gathered from survivors implies that it might be similar to suicides due to depression or bipolar disorders: not being able to cope anymore, not seeing a way out a.s.f. - that study is interesting but it is also not up to science gold-standard, but is interesting nonetheless.

It's okay if you want to hate on trans people, find them disgusting or deny them human rights. Do that, if you have to, protect your world view as hard as you can.

Just don't try to claim validity for this view by referring to science. Actual science, peer-reviewed studies and renowned researchers do support trans rights, existence and validate their claims.

Denying transness is just bigotry and you should just acknowledge that. Just own up to it, you have every right to be ignorant, thats free speech.

But don't use science as an excuse or ""gender studies hurrdurr"" to devalidate trans claims (no one even cares about gender studies). Everything else is strawman bullshit.
In other words: FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS

That reminds me of christians citing bible verses, but ignoring other bible verses.

Edit: Yes, downvote me to hell you oversensitive snowflakes. Every tear you shed makes my penis harder.

That plan was terrific, you played a Man with no Shadow at their own game and won, and I'm delighted that you ended the not-brother! And sorry for what you are going through, hope you get better soon. If you are looking for someone to help you with the camp or even with your current state of mind or situation, I would love to be that person. Relevant/important information: I'm a solitary practising Wicca of Slavic descent, and I've been given (sometimes it is a blessing, sometimes more like a curse) the duality, meaning, I'm not cisgender. I have ""knowledge"" (in quotes, because you can never know and understand fully, and I'd be a fool for thinking otherwise) about some of your inhabitants, know how to respect them, and met my share of entities - but probably not as many as you tho.

If you need anything, hit me up with a private message. Otherwise, I'll see if I can visit as a camper and not as a practitioner of the Art - unless I'm invited to be that, in whatever limited, constrained or full form; either way I'll heed your rules and won't interfere in your work nor offend your hospitality.

Until then, here is a small recipe for a concoction for a clear mind and a higher sense of alertness. That might help you with your pain medications side effect.

* You'll need a base oil of either almond or grapeseed; one tablespoon should be enough.
* Then you'll add (either as an oil, extract, powder or crushed raw material): Rosemary, Peppermint, Bergamot, Lemon. One Drop or sprinkle is enough.
* Mix this, put it in a glass overnight. Put it in your fridge, or any other safe spot where it's cold, dark and undisturbed during the night. Make sure that the moon does not shine on it.
* The next day add either Mint, Jasmine or Chamomile (whatever you have at hand, is most ""native"" or feels right), mix until uniform colour and wait until the glass (and mixture) is at roughly room temperature (\~20°C).

You can use it by massaging it into pulse points (e.g. wrists, neck) or temples (if it does not hurt). Your mind will be clearer, the fog will be less dense, and your senses less dulled; the effect will diminish when there is no residue left on your skin (hence the oil and mixing). But please do test it on a small spot on your skin, to avoid potential irritation or allergic reaction. Keep and store it in the same glass and in the same place where you put it the first time.

Stay safe!"

AsABlackMan,fk061cv,t1_fjysv8c,1583743526.0,"I'll look into your first objection and check if I have some citations at hand or more in-depth analysis, but I believe that there was one which was accounted for scholarships, extracurricular activities, and maybe jobs. There were no statistically relevant differences (meaning: there were slight differences, but not significant enough to be accounted to actual gender differences and instead accountable to math, statistics, method, individual disposition or quantity of participants in the study)

Regarding the second: the difference is most notably for virtual reality content since engines just render two pictures from different perspectives and do not account for the subtle shading differences (that would be computationally more intense since you have to double the work - whereas with default rendering of two perspectives, the graphics card and engine does not have to do double the work (although two perspectives/pictures are still more computationally intensive than one, hence the higher hardware requirements for VR content).

In the real world, depth and shading information is always present, so there is no difference. Both genders use both methods, there is no better/worse, just a slight difference which becomes apparent in virtual reality simulations leading to a higher motion sickness rate in women. There were some studies, one notably by the US military. On the other hand, there 1) fewer cases of stereo blindness (within individuals with two eyes) in women than in men, 2) probably because shading information is more robust than depth/parallax. Since I can't remember the studies regarding both claims, even less for the reason (2) and further details: Citation needed.

I don't have links since I save the PDF and/or citation information and abstract in my citation tool and should the need arise for more than I have access to different scientific journals and online resources, so I'm not sure if these papers are accessible without a paywall or an account.

**In the present study, we investigated discrepancies between two components of stereotyping by means of the popular notion that women are better at multitasking behaviors: the cognitive structure in individuals (personal belief) and the perceived consensus regarding certain beliefs (perceived belief of groups). With focus on this notion, we examined whether there was empirical evidence for the stereotype's existence and whether and how it was shared among different age groups. Data were collected from 241 young (n = 129) and older (n = 112) German individuals. The reported perceptions of gender effects at multitasking were substantial and thus demonstrated the existence of its stereotype. Importantly, in young and older adults, this stereotype existed in the perception of attributed characteristics by members of a collective (perceived belief of groups). When contrasting this perceived belief of groups and the personal belief, older adults showed a similar level of conformation of the gender stereotype while young adults were able to differentiate between these perspectives. Thus, young adults showed a discrepancy between the stereotype's components cognitive structure in individuals and perceived consensus regarding certain beliefs.The present study demonstrated hints for the existence of the stereotype that gender affects multitasking performance and this influence results in an advantage in women. In fact, the amount of reported attributions of gender effects at multitasking in the perceived belief of groups was relatively high in a survey among young adults, but not in older adults, when contrasted with the amount of reported personal beliefs.** \-

\> Assumption: CUE SELF\_FULLFILING\_PROPHECY.mp4  No seriously, its similiar to the placebo/nocebo effects. This believe stems from the hunter-gatherer hypothesis (which is not disproven, but not exactly as presented in pop science - increasing number of studies suggest an egalitarian and non-hierarchical approach in hunter-gatherer societies, meaning that 1) women and men were equal during these times and 2)  there were a significant number of female hunters and male gatherer, with their own advantages based on chromosomal expression \[layman: females were fast, agile, good at traping; males were good at foraging at higher places, could carry more and withstand more ""damage""; both things are linked to the effect of E or T on the human body\]. One such study, from Mark Dyble,  University College London, Anthropology Department. (with many more papers and research in this whole field)  But before we go there, just a quick nod to multi tasking. 

**Deficit in switching between functional brain networks underlies the impact of multitasking on working memory in older adultsWesley C. Clapp, Michael T. Rubens, Jasdeep Sabharwal, Adam GazzaleyProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Apr 2011, 108 (17) 7212-7217; DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1015297108**  

**Multitasking negatively influences the retention of information over brief periods of time. This impact of interference on working memory is exacerbated with normal aging. We used functional MRI to investigate the neural basis by which an interruption is more disruptive to working memory performance in older individuals. Younger and older adults engaged in delayed recognition tasks both with and without interruption by a secondary task. Behavioral analysis revealed that working memory performance was more impaired by interruptions in older compared with younger adults. Functional connectivity analyses showed that when interrupted, older adults disengaged from a memory maintenance network and reallocated attentional resources toward the interrupting stimulus in a manner consistent with younger adults. However, unlike younger individuals, older adults failed to both disengage from the interruption and reestablish functional connections associated with the disrupted memory network. These results suggest that multitasking leads to more significant working memory disruption in older adults because of an interruption recovery failure, manifest as a deficient ability to dynamically switch between functional brain networks.** 

\-> Furthermore, the paper finds that there is also an effect on younger - just not as pronounced as for older people. Very evident in studying and learning new things, as the following papers (no abstract here, cause I didn't save it apparently and am tzoo lazy to look for them) suggest.

\> THe gist is, if I remember correctly is basically, students perform less or bad when they multitask.

\-> THe brain is not made for true multi tasking. We can only hold information in logical chunks, and the amount of chunks varies between 7 an 9 I belive. We have a   psychological refractory period, which means that responding to a second stimulus or task leads to higher delay in solving or acknowledging the second task at all. You can look that up for yourself, because I dont have any papers here and I would like to continue. In essence: Switching context means that the brain has to restart and then refocus and reevaluate current status and progress.  

BACK TO HUNTERS!

**Dyble, et al. (2015). Sex equality can explain the unique social structure of hunter-gatherer bands. Science. 796. 6236.10.1126/science.aaa5139Abstract: Evolutionary theory stresses the importance of living with kin, not least because they share some of our genes. Nevertheless, a large-scale assessment of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies has established a consistent pattern of unrelated individuals living together. Dyble et al. used a modeling approach to suggest that a possible answer to this conundrum is that cohabitation choices are being governed equally by men and women.Science, this issue p. 796 The social organization of mobile hunter-gatherers has several derived features, including low within-camp relatedness and fluid meta-groups. Although these features have been proposed to have provided the selective context for the evolution of human hypercooperation and cumulative culture, how such a distinctive social system may have emerged remains unclear. We present an agent-based model suggesting that, even if all individuals in a community seek to live with as many kin as possible, within-camp relatedness is reduced if men and women have equal influence in selecting camp members. Our model closely approximates observed patterns of co-residence among Agta and Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers. Our results suggest that pair-bonding and increased sex egalitarianism in human evolutionary history may have had a transformative effect on human social organization.**

>“There is still this wider perception that hunter-gatherers are more macho or male-dominated. We’d argue it was only with the emergence of agriculture, when people could start to accumulate resources, that inequality emerged.”

AsABlackMan,fjypr49,t1_fjy9hhp,1583701947.0,"First, my original answer: 

> Because thats actually bullshit. Not referring to the childbear/stronger assumption. Math has been disproven, that is social upbringing. Skill set for sports - neurological? Bullshit. Men(or more precisely, males or testosterone-dominant humans) have an aptitude for sports because of physical differences - which come from testosterone. The same goes for an aptitude for violence. Multitasking does not exist, that's pop science bullshit, and women are not better at context-switching and have the same aptitude for information chunking as men. All in all that's pseudoscience. Most differences are due to cultural upbringing or due to ratio of hormones, which is driven by, but not linked to, sex and gender. Chromosomal disorders, hormonal disorders, intersex and transgender, and some medications indicate that hormones are the culprit, and not something inherent and unchangeable assigned at birth quality. And again, differences are minuscule. Fun fact, one actual difference between Males and Females is the a ability to see in 3D. Whereas Males take their cues from distance and parallax, females take their cues from difference to shading. Of course, both sexes use both cues, but there were indications that one sex (in general) uses some cues more than the other. 

&#x200B;

Here some stuff. I guess the most important one is the math stuff, because the other stuff is self-evident, as it refers not to an essentialist view of gender but to  a mixture of a constructionist gender view paired with the influence of hormones with factors like increased physical aptitude, muscle mass, height and so forth.

 **Abstract: In this article, we use meta-analysis to analyze gender differences in recent studies of mathematics performance. First, we meta-analyzed data from 242 studies published between 1990 and 2007, representing the testing of 1,286,350 people. Overall, d = 0.05, indicating no gender difference, and variance ratio = 1.08, indicating nearly equal male and female variances. Second, we analyzed data from large data sets based on probability sampling of U.S. adolescents over the past 20 years: the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the Longitudinal Study of American Youth, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Effect sizes for the gender difference ranged between -0.15 and +0.22. Variance ratios ranged from 0.88 to 1.34. Taken together, these findings support the view that males and females perform similarly in mathematics.**

**Abstract: Gendered patterns in mathematics and science interest emerge in early childhood, develop over time, and ultimately reflect advanced course selection in secondary education. During the crucial time adolescents become aware of their strengths and interests and specialize accordingly, they get the opportunity to participate in out-of-school learning programs such as mathematics and science competitions. This raises the question whether mathematics and science competitions contribute to gender equity by equally promoting female and male interests. In this article, we present a systematic review on gender differences and the mechanisms explaining success and failure in mathematics and science competitions. On an international level, we found large gender differences regarding participation in all Olympiads with the exception of the biology Olympiad. In fairs and national Olympiads, overall participation rates were not gendered as such, but females preferred biology topics whereas males preferred physics related topics. Male and female achievement in fairs was comparable, but males clearly outperformed female participants at the Olympiads, with the smallest differences in the biology Olympiad. Variables and theoretical frameworks explaining participation and achievement and the role of gender in mathematics and science competitions are discussed. We suggest that gender stereotypes, through their influence on self-concept and interest, play an important role in the mechanisms resulting in low female participation rates in and beyond mathematics and science competitions (especially in physics and chemistry). The mechanisms we found explaining female representation during a national selection competition might be considered as reflecting those in female mathematics or science careers and could thus serve as food for thought on countering the gender gap in mathematics and science.**

\-> Assumption: Women are discouraged to perform in scientific/mathematical disciplines, by cultural expectations and stereotypes. These are deeply ingrained, leading to bad performance and less willingness to learn because they believe that they are „just not made for it“

**Frichot, Gabrielsson, Runting. (2017) Architecture and Feminisms: Ecologies, Economies, Technologies. Routledge, 110ff.**

**Chapter Excerpt 52(j): Recently more women have been graduating from universities than men in Europe, North America and Australia. According to a 2016 report by the Higher Education Policy Institute, men are currently less likely than women to go to British universities, those who do are more likely to drop out and those who complete their course are less likely to get a good degree. On the other hand, there are fewer women than men at the top of the academic hierarchy, those women are paid less and are less likely than men to have had children.**  
   
 \-> Assumption: Whereas there is a favorable outcome for „younger“ women (current generations) in university, there also seems to be discrimination for „older“ women (previous generations), suggesting hierarchical/patriarchal structures which have their origins in the earlier generations cultural upbringing and male-centred sentiments or social conditioning suggesting a inaptitude for women to be „scientific“ or a similar concept.

**Abstract:** 

**The topic of gender differences in mathematical performance has received considerable attention in the fields of education, sociology, economics and psychology.We analysed gender differences based on data from the Beijing Assessment of Educational Quality in China.A large data set of Grade 5 and Grade 8 students who took the mathematical test from 2008 to 2013 (n = 73,318) were analysed.**

**The findings were as follows. (1) No gender differences in mathematical achievement exist among students in Grade 5, relatively small gender differences exist in Grade 8, females scored higher than males, and variance of male students is larger than that of females in both Grade 5 and Grade 8. (2) Except for statistics and probability, gender differences in other domains in Grade 8 are significantly higher than those in Grade 5, and female students outperform males. (3) The ratio of students of both gender in Grade 5 and Grade 8 at the 95-100% percentile level shows no significant differences. However, the ratio of male students is significantly higher than that of females at the 0-5% percentile level. (4) In Grade 5, the extent to which females outperformed males in low SES group is larger than that in higher SES groups, and in Grade 8, the magnitude of gender differences in urban schools is smaller than that in rural schools.**

\-> Assumption: Women are discouraged to go to mathematics, due to social and cultural pressure, except when they exhibit an aptitude for mathematics, suggesting that this may be the reason for these differences.
