There was also one called The Uninvited by Tim Wynne-Jones. >!Basically the main character moves to a new town and meets a hot guy who turns out to be her brother she didn't know about. There's awkward sexual tension the whole time. Then she meets this other hot guy who has an obsession with her. Guess what, he's also her bother she didn't know about. I remember in the end she kills him because he was insane and threatening her somehow, and the last paragraph is all about him thinking about how even though it turns out she's his sister, that makes him even more into her.!<"

Back then, the virus was on the news a lot but I assumed it would be like all the other viruses we've heard about like Zika, Swine Flu, etc that didn't seem to ever become a huge problem. I didn't want to wait forever for it to end, I just wanted to start my life. I'd been planning this for almost 6 months.

I lived with my mom, little sister and our animals. It was easy to live there. Now that I'm in my own apartment, I can't stop thinking about how things would be for me right now if I'd somehow had the foresight to know not to leave. I'm in California and just feel like I'm wasting my money on nothing because I can't even get a job for possibly months. If I were there, I wouldn't be paying rent, I'd have people to talk to and play games with, and I could just wait it out before moving away. But I'm here.

I'm not miserable or anything, I just feel like I made a mistake. And I try to be understanding with myself. I couldn't have known things would become this serious so quickly. Everyone is feeling some loss and anxiety right now. I was just trying to be brave and live my own life. The timing just makes me sad.

(Before anyone suggests it, I'm not gonna move back home now because I don't see a way to sell all of my stuff or take it with me -- I just furnished an entire apartment. I have a 1 year lease because I told myself when I got here that I'd give it a year to see how I feel about living here.
