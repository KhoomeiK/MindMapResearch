bipolar,fpna67u,t3_gedvzx,1588755641.0,Congrats!!
BipolarReddit,fpjl7wq,t3_gdnfgw,1588672706.0,I find mine helpful for when I have anxiety or panic attacks! There‚Äôs something really soothing about it.
bipolar,fpjko2l,t1_fpajz1b,1588672114.0,"If it‚Äôs any consolation, my insomnia did end up chilling out a bit but it still takes me longer to fall asleep and I‚Äôm not sleeping as long as I usually do, however the sleep quality is a lot better. It‚Äôs gone up a bit since I went up to 100mg, definitley not as bad as it was when I posted. I hope you find something that works for you and that you‚Äôre able to have some relief!"
Siamesecats,foezkf1,t3_g6v3ig,1587720483.0,Possibly a Balinese! They‚Äôre also known as long haired Siamese. My Balinese looked exactly like this as a kitten.
bipolar,fnzecvi,t1_fnytgm4,1587392392.0,Honestly it‚Äôs helpful to know that other people have/are experiencing the same symptom and it‚Äôs not just me so thank you for sharing your experience with me! Hoping you get some relief soon too.
bipolar,fnzd5zv,t1_fnyyzxf,1587391689.0,"Interesting, I‚Äôve had the same post-titration/beginning dose symptoms with headaches and nausea. I‚Äôve only gone from 25 to 50 so far so I‚Äôm wondering if possibly it will be the same with the insomnia once I get higher up in dosage/keep titrating."
bipolar,fnzcm9g,t1_fnzb6do,1587391363.0,"I have been taking it at night as instructed. I wasn‚Äôt sure if taking it in the morning would change the sleep/it‚Äôs length of potency so this is helpful, thank you!"
BipolarReddit,fnsi44d,t3_g3m4km,1587222090.0,"I was prescribed Seroquel to help with sleep. I take 200mg at night and it basically knocks me right out about an hour after taking it. I think since it‚Äôs used also as a sleep aid, the sleepiness is probably a common side effect. It‚Äôs kept effectiveness for me in the sleep department."
bipolar2,fn19m8g,t3_fyff4w,1586557540.0,Looks delicious!!

BipolarReddit,fktmc41,t3_fkjk0t,1584526368.0,"I have heard this as well! In retrospect, many of my symptoms started to come out after trauma in my early teens but blossomed my first year in university. I found out some family members of my extended family had bipolar about a year or so after I was diagnosed (not super close so didn‚Äôt know this prior)."
BipolarReddit,fi04st1,t3_f5okam,1582026373.0,"Phenomenal, congratulations!"
BipolarReddit,fhwi1th,t3_f4y49q,1581916469.0,Lithium was my game changer. It‚Äôs fantastic it‚Äôs working well for you!!
BipolarReddit,fht6uat,t3_f4ma58,1581870968.0,"I have found work wise the most challenging with stigma and how to navigate it. I‚Äôm a social worker and despite working in this field, I‚Äôve had a lot of colleagues talk about folks with bipolar negatively. I find it‚Äôs mostly out of incompetency or fear. I‚Äôve let it go sometimes when I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in where the situation would go if I said something and other times I have said something without disclosing. 

I have had a good and bad experience disclosing to a boss. Good experience ended up in more resources for the team and being treated as an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù rather than poorly. Bad experience ended up from feeling pressured to disclose and my boss give me unsolicited medical advice during supervision and it being used against me.

I have disclosed to colleagues twice. Once when I was first diagnosed and was figuring out the whole disclosure thing and it luckily went well and ended up in folks being supportive. Other time was with a colleague I felt close to and worked closely with and that also went well and our relationship didn‚Äôt change in the slightest. None of my current coworkers or bosses know and I‚Äôm so far not planning on disclosing anytime soon. 

So, I guess for me the most challenging part is hearing the negative stuff from coworkers. I always try to tell myself where that BS is coming from but it never makes it more comfortable. I do often wonder when they are saying things if I said well I‚Äôm bipolar and that‚Äôs not true what would happen. I tell my therapist I often feel like I‚Äôm undercover at work. 

I would recommend not disclosing prior to being hired and going through HR for accommodations if you need them. When I have had to get accommodations, my pysch never had to give my diagnosis which was a relief - I‚Äôm sure this works differently for different locations etc. Only disclose where you feel safe to do so and don‚Äôt feel pressured to. 

Good luck!!"
bipolar_irl,fg0ukxy,t1_fg0ueab,1580415320.0,I‚Äôm turning 24 this year and things the past few months have really started to look up! Lithium was my treatment game changer.
bipolar_irl,fg0tnqe,t3_ew9aaz,1580414798.0,"Diagnosed at 22 but in retrospect, had symptoms since my teens."
BipolarReddit,fbsthkl,t3_eebg8k,1577060245.0,"My cats have been really helpful! If I‚Äôm crying or breaking down, they‚Äôll come near me. I find it comforting to pet them when I‚Äôm upset, it‚Äôs grounding in a sense? Also when I‚Äôve been depressed, I still will get up to feed them, clean their litter, etc which is helpful in allowing me to feel like at least I did something when everything else seems like too much."
bipolar,f9x1z8o,t3_e6l2g2,1575703192.0,"Right now, I‚Äôm missing about a day a month at my full time job and have been overwhelmed by taking up any shifts at my casual job and having to cancel some. I think this changes depending on how I‚Äôm doing. Currently, I feel very exhausted from various things that I‚Äôve now cut down on but definitely affecting my attendance at work and basically anything right now. So yeah, definitely affected by my bipolar. I also get super anxious about how this is perceived by colleagues and my bosses and it‚Äôs always a worry of mine it will affect my employment. So far though, not even someone bringing it up to me."
bipolar,f7gljd9,t1_f79fr1h,1573707607.0,"I found when my levels were where they should be, my mood is very even. Although, some highs and lows do occur but they‚Äôre not the same intensity as they use to be. Hope this helps!"
bipolar,f7glc8m,t1_f77wb79,1573707416.0,"I‚Äôm on lithium (1200mg). I‚Äôve heard good things about using metformin and am hoping to ask my doctor about it next appointment. Right now, I‚Äôm using melatonin. My doctor said this helps burn fat and reduce it from staying. Also since lithium can bottom put your thyroid, it‚Äôs really important to get your TSH checked since it has impact in weight. Lithium reduced my function and I had to go on a thyroid med which has helped me lose weight more easily than before."
bipolar,f7gl52q,t1_f785yiv,1573707223.0,All the time. They‚Äôre super vivid too.

bipolar,f7gl1ox,t1_f7arjnp,1573707134.0,100% agree with the cuddling cat. Always brings a little smile to my face when shit hits the fan.
bipolar,f7gkzvu,t1_f7aqjmb,1573707088.0,Happy to hear it‚Äôs working for you! How did you start in eliminating processed sugars? I‚Äôve slowly cut out most caffeine.
bipolar,f7gkusz,t1_f7aw36k,1573706958.0,I use to use cbd and found it really helpful pre-diagnosis. Not quite sure why I stopped!
bipolar,f14cb50,t3_d7o5kg,1569172410.0,"I currently work in the field I went to school for. I am able to manage it full time. I attribute it to medication (lithium) and also using work as coping. For me, work gives me time where I can throw myself into something to lessen everything happening in my head so it helps me cope. I‚Äôve found it depending on the job though. I‚Äôve had awful jobs that have worsened it. So I‚Äôve definitely had to quit jobs. I‚Äôve also had to take medical leaves. There are some days, weeks where work doesn‚Äôt help and I feel awful. I also make sure to keep up with my care - therapy, doctors, meds, etc. This helps my energy to function."

SuicideWatch,ezsco1h,t3_d1ywaq,1568087257.0,"I have no hope in the future. I can‚Äôt see myself living another 60+ years. I just can‚Äôt imagine it at all. In the present, everything feels hopeless. It just feels like a huge shit storm and I no longer no what to do. It‚Äôs really fucking hard and I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can hang in there."
SuicideWatch,ezsbvik,t3_d21m4w,1568086613.0,Congrats! This is really great progress and such a huge step in a positive direction!
SuicideWatch,ezsbr5z,t3_d21ukt,1568086528.0,"No, you weren‚Äôt the asshole. It sounds like in both situations your friends didn‚Äôt realize your point of view or why you were upset and had a really negative response when you spoke up."
BipolarReddit,ex5phh3,t3_crd42f,1566028967.0,Amazing!! Happy you found something that works for you.
bipolar,ex5oy7l,t1_ex4lhmt,1566028625.0,"I could definitely try - in the field I work in, it wouldn‚Äôt be awful to disclose disability. If I didn‚Äôt do nights, I would still be able to rotate between days and evenings so I don‚Äôt think it would be a huge loss for the organization if I requested."
bipolar,ex37ba1,t3_cr8rrc,1565981175.0,"Wow, thank you everyone for sharing so honestly. I guess I didn‚Äôt think it would be that bad and have rationalized it quite a bit with I‚Äôm use to heavy work loads/weeks, I feel fine and I‚Äôm stable now, the extra cash is nice, the job is calm and I like it, it‚Äôs only once in awhile for overnights, etc. I‚Äôm definitely going to rethink it and see if I could stay but with skipping the overnight rotation or go down to relief instead of part time. I have a full time well paying job and this was something to distract me from some paranoia I was having weeks back. I liked the routine of having to go to work and it kept me busy and away from what I felt (paranoia) was so destructive.

Edit: I am stubborn to my own fault and pretty much brushed my family off and didn‚Äôt share I received any night shifts with them. I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could do it despite bipolar."
mentalhealth,evb9yha,t3_cizvwz,1564370282.0,I did and it was fantastic. It felt like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I ended up redownloading one I felt didn‚Äôt have a toll/because I felt like I was missing out on friends‚Äô lives that didn‚Äôt live in the same town but might end up deleting it again. There was something so peaceful about it.
BipolarSOs,eulvne8,t1_eukqhm4,1563908140.0,"I had a little bit. I felt it was unfair that others were being brought in (family too) to help assess. I felt it was unfair at first because I thought that meant I would be listened to less (not true at all) and it was me who was experiencing it after all. However, I quickly realized the benefit of it. 1) I noticed how it helped in me feeling better and 2) I work in the field so I i was able to rationalize it more as to an asset to a treatment plan."
BipolarSOs,eugud99,t1_eugfzhq,1563815051.0,"I took 200mg at a time. My pysch saw how the dose reacted and boosted 200mg until 1000mg. I was told by my pysch 1000mg is the normal dosage. Before this, I did switch medication a couple times between SSRIs (super not helpful) to anti-psychotic mood stabilizers. So it can take time to find the right one - there‚Äôs quite a few on the market now. Sometimes too, I know folks who take 2 mood stabilizers and that helps more than 1. 

With meds, my doctor was really good in involving my partner. Sometimes, when I thought I was doing well ish, I wasn‚Äôt and it was helpful for my doctor to have the partner perspective to gage medication on top of my perspective. If your partner and the doctor is open to you sitting in for part of a session, it might be helpful for the meds and for you to feel heard and give feedback on what you‚Äôre seeing. Hope some of this info helps on the meds front!"
BipolarSOs,euf2jno,t1_euf1rqj,1563760721.0,"In the first week, I found my suicidal ideation basically vanished which in turn helped with my functionality. In the month, my mood felt more stable. Any mania/hypomania/depression was much less intense and shorter. It would be a couple days and manageable vs weeks and unmanageable like it use to. I also found myself a lot less irritable and snappy at others. It took me 1000mg of lithium to feel really good and baseline."
BipolarSOs,euf04p2,t3_cg39kx,1563758794.0,"Hey, I‚Äôm BP and on the same med combo of your partner. To answer your question on when they worked - seroquel for sleep worked right away and lithium worked pretty quickly, I noticed effects within the first week but would say full effects within a month."
Paranoia,et7zq2o,t3_cabflh,1562542509.0,"I can relate to this a lot. It‚Äôs not much but I try to distract myself as best as I can when this happens. I like to get outside and walk and blare music and forget about it all or try to. I find having those little spaces for peace helps my overall sanity and wellbeing, just small chunks of time I can not focus as hard on the paranoia. It doesn‚Äôt drown it out completely but it at least helps in not being so focused on it."
bipolar2,et7wyk8,t3_ca8el3,1562540361.0,I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre on the mend! I found lithium to be very helpful with suicidal ideation even on the lower doses.
bipolar,eoww7x1,t1_eowhwsh,1558915732.0,Happy birthday!
bipolar,eowv0yc,t3_btaaud,1558915268.0,Feeling stressed and not wanting to share my feelings with others (so they don‚Äôt worry) so I went for a nice long walk in the sun to help me clear my mind. It helped!
bipolar,eole00t,t3_bsbqpf,1558669353.0,100% when I go to a hospital ER. I feel like everything revolves it even though I always indeed end up being super ill. It‚Äôs like you become instantly not credible when they read you have bipolar.
bipolar,eoeigaz,t3_bre4zw,1558497431.0,"Alllll the time. Especially if I‚Äôm in an episode, depressed or manic. Even though there is no denying I am 110% bipolar."
bipolar,eodnz6x,t1_eodnn9z,1558477067.0,"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve heard! Not trying to get pregnant right now but likely in the next 2 years. I just don‚Äôt want to be messing around with meds by trying new ones when that time comes so trying to plan a bit. My psychiatrist decided to wait on adding for another week or two but said it would be Latuda. Only downside is I heard it‚Äôs super expensive compared to most meds?"
bipolar,eoa4pd4,t3_bqwfyo,1558407241.0,"I went up to 1200mg on lithium and I‚Äôm experiencing side effects..hand tremors have surprisingly been the most pain in the ass to deal with.  Tomorrow, my psychiatrist is deciding whether to add Latuda or Lamotrogone to the picture. All I asked is for a med I could stay on during pregnancy as I‚Äôm cautiously looking to the future."
