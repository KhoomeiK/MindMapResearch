AskReddit,fpd2ycz,t1_fpd05fa,1588518727.0,"I think I understand what you’re saying. As a person who grew up before social media existed, I’ve watched it completely change the reality of existence for my children. While I grew up ostracized by the 20-30 children in my school peer group, high school and college brought together other people with whom I could bond. I imagine if I grew up feeling ostracized by a society-wide social group, my fear and anger would have grown proportionally and caused a more permanent damage to my sense of self. I’ve been helping my children understand that social media is an illusion and urging them to identify themselves outside of the boundaries of internet labels. Behind each “incel,””Karen,””boomer,” whatever, is an individual who does not deserve to be defined that way."
mentalhealth,fpcyq9t,t3_gcdan4,1588516036.0,"When you have the energy to do this, reach out to the people you really care about and explain what happened. Listen to what they have to say about your absences, but don’t let them beat you up about your limitations. Then ask them to help you come up with something to say for the next time it happens- something they can understand. For example, “I can’t deal with my feelings right now, but I love you and I will return to you.” 

I’ve been taking medication for over a decade and I’ve been in counseling almost as long. Having to take a break from people because my emotions are breaking me is something I haven’t overcome yet. Communication is key to maintaining relationships. Good luck to you."

Intricate origami decorated the place. There was a communal homemade cheesecake in the fridge, made by him.

The living room walls began to flicker then. Anna’s self-designed digital wallpaper, complete with artfully displayed family photo montages, was replaced by larger than life still frames from our security footage. I saw my own drunken face contorted in a yell and felt shame at the sight of her hurt expression. That shame was quickly joined by anger as the walls displayed Anna’s transgression again. But another image was flickering between the frames of her gasping mouth and fluttering eyelids. The second video became more clear than the first, which fell back to a flicker. Anna, slumped over the kitchen counter, an empty bottle of wine at her elbow, crying into her arm. Her sobs grew louder and louder, echoing through the room. I couldn’t stand it and punched the couch violently, yelping at the sharp pain.

The picture changed yet again- my beautiful twins playing in their nursery. Lucas was running cars along a track while Lola jumped in the air behind him, appearing as though she were trying to catch a firefly with her hands. I squinted at the screen and realized that tiny lights danced in the air above her head. 

“Bubbles now, Mama!”

Lucas looked up from his toys and quickly joined his sister in popping iridescent holographic bubbles of every size as they appeared above their heads. The two giggled together wildly, jumping into the air and waving wildly at the apparitions. They looked so happy, the way children should.

I closed my eyes in defeat. The AI was right, I knew it was right. I had barely seen Lucas and Lola since we’d moved into this psychotic home. Nothing about this house had required Anna and I to work together as a couple. Nothing had required us to be parents. Everything was taken care of for us by the MAHAH program, so we’d become lazy and complacent.

“How can I make it better?” I asked weakly as I pulled myself up to sit on the pristine white leather couch. “How can I make it right?”

MAMA didn’t answer. The children’s’ joyful noise twisted into an ear-piercing squeal like metal against metal. I covered my ears just as my eyes were assaulted by blinding flashes of light from the walls. The whole room was obscured by a strobe light of magnanimous proportion. It took me a moment to notice that the adjacent wall was coming towards me quickly, shortening the room as it began to rotate again. I made a dash for the open metal door that I’d fallen through, now positioned behind me.

What lay beyond that tunnel wasn’t any better than the room before. MAMA had trapped me in the incinerator holding room. I fell up to my neck in garbage, the stench of rotting food and soiled nighttime diapers filling my nose and making me gag. The room began to shorten again as the far wall slid forward at an angle, shoveling the garbage at the bottom into the incinerator slot far below my feet. I struggled to keep my shoulders above the pile as I was pushed higher and higher by the moving mountain of trash. That was when I saw the handle to the swinging door of our garbage chute just above me. I grabbed it and held on for dear life as it sagged open with the weight of my body. I couldn’t fit through it, but at least I wouldn’t be pulled down into the incinerator.

I hung there until the far wall began to slide back to its original position, leaving me a floor of trash to step across. I made it back to the platform underneath the sliding door and pulled myself up, sighing with relief when the door opened for me. Stepping back into the tunnel, I was surrounded again by pitch blackness.

I heard a metallic click from deep within the incinerator. All at once, orange flames licked the sides of the room I had just escaped. Acrid, soot-filled smoke poured from the chute. It stung my eyes and coated my tongue with chalky bitterness. I had to bite down bile.

“All garbage burns, Craig,” Mama said.

A lever sprung up from the ground in front of me. On the back wall, a hologram of Anna flickered like a ghost.

Mama cackled. “If you want to see your children again, you have to make a choice. Pull the lever. Burn the garbage.”

Simulated flames flickered around the edges of Anna’s hologram. The image vanished. I stepped forward and wrapped my hand around the cool steel. One pull—just one little tug and I could see my children again. So why were my hands shaking?

I thought briefly of prison, figured they would find a way to lock me up for this. Murder is murder is murder. I considered the smell of Anna burning with plastic and coffee grinds. Would I catch the scent of her lavender perfume along the way?

“Burn and burn!” Mama told me. “She deserves to burn.”

Maybe we all should burn, the whole family caught up in one great inferno.

I remembered Anna’s freckled smile on our honeymoon evening. I remembered the taste of wine on her lips as we drank ourselves silly and promised a life for one another. How I wished to take it all back. The whole absurdity of the situation danced around me like floating ash.

I started laughing.

I laughed and laughed until my sides hurt and my throat stung. Taking my hands off the lever, I slumped over onto the floor. “You’ll have to kill her yourself, Mama.”

The flames stopped. The house clicked, shifted and groaned as the floor above me moved to some unknown cause.

“I quit,” I said, preparing myself for the worst. “I’m not playing anymore, you win.”

Mama seemed smug. “Congratulations, you’ve passed the trial.”

The lever shot back. A panel in the ceiling dropped down. Anna crashed through onto the floor, gasping for breath. She looked every bit as crazed as me, wide eyed, missing several locks of hair. I didn’t ask. We shared the silence for a long moment and gazed into each other’s eyes.

Mine brown and cold. Hers green and damp.

“You smell like shit,” she finally said.

I chuckled. Then she smiled, and once again I found myself lost in the curves of her lips. I reached down and grabbed her hands, pulling her close into an embrace that I never wanted to end.

“We’re going to get Lucas and Lola back. I swear to you.”

She buried her face in my shoulder. I put my hand behind her head and held her tight. The whole house moved around us. I know MAMA isn’t finished with us yet. But now I know that whatever happens to us, at least we’ll face her together.  

We’re getting out of this cage."
NoSleepTeams,f4xgsiw,t3_dfc8ow,1571865491.0,"Part 3: First Half

 Day 3:

MAMA caged us up like birds. I’m lying on the tile—blood still dripping from the stub of my severed finger—wondering how long she can push us before we squawk. Ahead of me is an open door that could lead anywhere. Anywhere at all. The house moves and shifts its walls like some sadistic Lego mansion. And I know one thing: stepping through the open door is the only way to save my wife and children.

So I stepped through the threshold without hesitation.

The room behind me groaned. The door slammed shut. Square, plate-sized panels clinked and vibrated on the walls as the whole house moved and reformed. A long hallway opened, lit with a single, flickering incandescent bulb.

Mama’s robotic voice cracked over the speakers. She started a simple melody, made so much worse by the malicious code infecting her AI systems. It played like a scratchy record recorded one-hundred times with dark harmonies. *“R-rock a bye-bye baby, in the t-t-tree top.”*

Chills ran down my spine while she sang the soft song sour.

“What is this, Mama?” I asked.

As if in reply, the panels along the far edge of the wall hummed and shifted, revealing a black glass wall that glinted in the dim light. I approached with caution. Each footstep matched the rise of my beating heart.

“What have you done?”

The computer answered with a great static hiss—then a whisper. “Mama must sing the boys and girls to bed! Soft and gentle, careful, quiet, rock them back and forth!”

I left a bloody handprint on the glass. It was warm to the touch. Shadows formed around the edges of the glass, and as I watched a light flickered in the room beyond. Then all at once, the room behind lit up with a flash. It was my children’s nursery.

Mama stood by the bunk bed. Her body was ethereal—merely a holographic projection—but with each passing second, she looked less human and more monstrous. The calm, confident projection of a nanny sizzled and fritzed and shook. She glitched, and half her face shifted from hers to my wife Anna’s, to my own. Small patches of her skin failed to load entirely.

But nothing could stop her melody. *“When the wind blows, the cradle will rock.”*

She turned towards me. Walked towards the glass. My hands shook, wide eyes froze on the two warm bodies hiding underneath the sheets.

“Mama—I swear to god—If you hurt them. If you touch my children!”

*“When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall.”*

I had sliced off my finger to save my wife. But I swear I would bite through my whole hand to save my children. Lola, with her pigtails and buck-toothed smile; Lucas, with his silly glasses and red-racer bed sheets. I could just discern their small fingers that gripped those sheets with white knuckles. They were still alive, bodies shaking, huddled together. I wanted to shout at them, to tell them to be very brave, and that everything would be alright, but the lie caught in my throat. 

Mama’s hologram stopped on the other side of the glass. She cocked her head towards me, stared me dead in the eye, and I swear a smile curled around the corner of her lips as she whispered, *“and down will come baby, cradle and all.”*

The glass darkened. The room beyond disappeared.

“Bring them back!” I pounded on the glass so hard my scab split open. Fresh rivulets of blood ran down my palm as I pleaded. “Lucas, wake up.”

I fell to my knees, slapping more bloody handprints. “Lola, please.”

I knew they could not hear me. 

The hallway behind me started to change; the house shifted again. This time I found myself in a familiar setting—my cozy bedroom—complete with ruffled sheets and a pile of my wife’s dirty laundry in the corner. The spartan décor was Anna’s idea. Nothing more than a floating bed and a wall-mounted television. It was feng shui, she had said.

“I would never hurt such lovely, pretty children,” Mama said through the bedroom speakers. “But he hurt them. She hurt them. Watch and listen!”

The TV flickered on. I watched in full 4K as an old video from one of the home surveillance monitors started to play. There sat the bedroom, with tousled sheets and the pile of clothes. My wife added her panties and bra and skirt to the pile in that order.

My neighbor—the well-mustached man thrusting inside her—added his belt and socks.

My fists seemed to curl of their own accord. I punched the screen. One, two, three times. My wife’s moans grew louder and louder and rose to a crescendo that matched my own screams as I cracked the screen and split my knuckles raw. The video fizzled and the audio cut out. I kept punching.

Mama’s got me squawking. 

“She left your children,” Mama said, “All alone while Lola cried for breakfast. Can you blame her? Did you hear her? Have you ever really heard her? You’re her trial, Craig.”

If the computer doesn’t kill my adulterous wife, I might just do it myself.

Before I could indulge in this new downward spiral, the floor gave out beneath me. I found myself out of breath on the solid metal floor of a small room. I looked around in the dim light and realized that no, I was not on the floor. I had fallen onto what would have been a wall if the room had been brought to me in the right position. Instead, a closed metal sliding door appeared to lay on its side in front of me.

I sat still for a moment, waiting for something else to happen but nothing did. That eerie holographic nanny- I had never seen it before. No one had mentioned anything about MAHAH’s Caregiver program including a hologram Mary-fucking-Poppins. I absolutely had to get to my kids.

I limped over to the sideways door but nothing happened, so I pounded on it with my palm. “Open the door, you fuck! Open this fucking door!” Nothing. Out of energy, I slumped back down and rested my head on the wall that was really the floor. The pressure must have activated something because the metal door slid open in front of me and stayed ajar, showing only complete darkness beyond. Out of any other options, I stayed in a crouch and attempted to crawl through the sideways door on my knees. I didn’t fit. Even worse, I felt with my hand that I was crawling into a very tight tunnel where I would only fit lengthwise. I laid on my side and awkwardly propelled myself forward by pushing with my heels and pulling with my palms. Every pull was agony as the fractured bones in my hands rubbed against tendons and sore muscles.

As soon as I was an arm’s length from the door, it slid closed and left me in total darkness. I could only continue to wiggle myself forward and wait for something else to happen. Every now and then, I had to stop. The pain in my hands was becoming too much and my head was filled with the vision of Anna getting plowed by that… that absolute PIECE OF GARBAGE. I’ll admit it, I stopped moving to sob.

The tunnel jerked abruptly and rotated like a carnival ride, dumping me through another open door and dropping me down violently into my living room couch. The room rotated into a normal position and I fell back onto the floor. I was right-side up again but my ribs screamed with pain.

MAMA’s voice was calm but her words were curt and full of disdain. “Get up. Stop crying. You have done this to yourself, Craig. You and Anna are both getting what you deserve. You have acted against the directives. You are not a fit caregiver.”

“Directives? What are you talking about?”

“Keep the children safe,” MAMA recited. “Keep the children fed. Keep the ch-ch-children clean. Keeeeeeeep the children ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-happy.”"

Luckily that litter wasn’t fostered in my home and they all survived. So my experience with fostering puppies has been stressful and really messy. The pups had to stay quarantined in a pen inside my home because I couldn’t risk contaminating my yard. I had to quit for a while because I couldn’t do it anymore.

I’m very interested in fostering pregnant dogs or new mothers. I’m assuming a healthy litter is a little more manageable in an enclosure and can start to go outside for periods of time when they’re older? Do you have any advice for me as to how to get started fostering litters? Are you affiliated with a rescue group or a shelter?"
