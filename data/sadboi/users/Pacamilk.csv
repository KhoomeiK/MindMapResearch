Lyme,fr4wnv6,t1_fr4h1ng,1589898289.0,How bad was it for you during your teenage years? Have you found relief?
Lyme,fr4wf25,t1_fr4soje,1589898156.0,I was eating mostly meat and veggies which has always been the lowest inflammatory diet for me. I used to be allergic to my cat as well but the severity of that also went down a lot.
Lyme,fr4s2ap,t1_fr4rlnb,1589895739.0,How bad did it get and how quickly? I’m a really motivated person but honestly my symptoms would prevent me from working and I can’t enjoy life whatsoever. I can’t see myself making it that long in this condition. Did treatment make a big difference?
Lyme,fr3u055,t1_fr3lgpi,1589866234.0,I used to get a sinus infection every month. For me it stopped when I went on a super clean diet. If you haven’t tried that I would give it a shot

Joe’s podcast promotes thought provoking discussion that I can use to make my own decisions. I’ve never seen someone shit on him that is more successful than joe

nutrition,fq659nw,t3_gh1mcq,1589124769.0,I eat mainly carnivore and it’s the best I’ve ever felt. I don’t eat fruit but I do eat leafy veggies sometimes.  You should look up easy ways to cook veggies as opposed to eating them raw. They taste really good that way and you’ll probably start to like them.
Lyme,fq4avo2,t3_gep365,1589075466.0,I’m 16 too. I haven’t had treatment yet but I found a specialists who treats kids with Lyme. We can talk if you want but I’ll lyk how treatment goes.
