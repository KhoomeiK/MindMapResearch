BPD,fr0b9ni,t3_glu67n,1589789613.0,"i have a really hard time figuring out when *is* the right time to reveal deep/emotional things. like, people do that right??? but every time i do it it seems like i’m making things awkward or being extra. why can people share intimate things with me all the time but i can’t seem to do it right, myself? idk how to connect with people in a socially acceptable way. i feel you, the embarrassment can feel devastating. big bpd feel :("

continue to do research, and tell her you’ve done said research. ask her if it’s okay if you ask some questions, and if she says yes, find out what you want to know, because i’m sure you’re curious! ask what’s helpful for her/what she wants you to try when she’s in different difficult situations, and be patient as you both navigate the way schizoaffective can show up in a relationship. 

a big thing i wish i would tell people off the bat: sometimes i think really weird/scary/frustrating things!! be ready to hear these things if you want genuine open communication. it’s very lonely to have thoughts and feelings that are hard/“socially unacceptable” to share with loved ones. she might not ever want to talk about it(i usually don’t anyway), but knowing that she can get things off her chest if she needs to with someone she trusts could be very comforting. if she does confide in you and tells you something you haven’t heard before, imagine it was yourself having these thoughts/hallucinations. her reality is different than yours sometimes. no need to pretend what she’s experiencing is reality, and no need to tell her everything she’s feeling is fake either(unless she wants that approach). empathize, validate her feelings, and ask if there’s anything you can do to make her feel more comfortable. 

it’s also important that you trust her, too. she knows herself best! if she’s having a hard time handling her symptoms, don’t take it into your hands and call her therapist/the police/her family unless it’s your only option, which it usually won’t be. let her have the reigns when she’s struggling- ask what she needs and be supportive, just step in where she needs you. 

best of luck to you both, i’m so happy she has you!"

schizoaffective,fpz2q0d,t1_fpz28po,1589012718.0,"whether i’m manic or depressed(or mixed) i tend to cling to one particular song for the duration of the episode. when i’m manic it can feel like the song really resonates, or can give me a rush of dopamine that no other song can. when i’m more depressed, it often just feels very important and as if it clicks perfectly into my life. i think it has to do with the way every new episode puts me into a brand new mindset and energy, and i want something to ground me from the intensity."

OCD,fpmwcqk,t1_fpmw00n,1588743486.0,"yes!!!! sometimes i’ll be hanging out with any trusted friend and suddenly some little behavior of theirs will prompt those feelings for me. i fear it in a ‘supernatural horror movie’ way but also in a more realistic way, like getting nervous when they pick up a knife to cut food or something, like “they’re finally gonna stab me today”"
OCD,fpmvqqs,t3_ge7x9q,1588743035.0,"lately every time someone makes eye contact with me i brace myself because i’m convinced their face is going to twist and warp into some kind of horror movie shit and i’m gonna have to protect myself from them? just weird recurring fear that people are secretly inhuman and going to attack me when we’re alone together. keeps me on my toes 

another weird one is that often after i eat/drink i start to worry that it was covered in/full of mold or something gross and that i was hallucinating that it was normal while i consumed it. makes me sick, hate that one"
therapy,fplpubu,t1_fplo1l0,1588717185.0,"so technically, she(probably, depending on your state) *could* tell your parents, but she can’t tell the police. and even though she *could* tell them, if she’s a great therapist she probably knows that telling your parents you smoke weed knowing it’ll get you into trouble at home would damage your therapeutic relationship. when i was a minor, my therapists all knew about my drug use and never told on me. my advice is to ask her about your confidentiality first, maybe say “is there anything you’d tell my parents besides that i was at imminent risk of hurting myself or someone else?” that way, you can feel it out and see if you think it’s safe to share!"
