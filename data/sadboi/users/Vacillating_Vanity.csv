He isn't at a point in time in life to take a relationship more seriously. And once it crossed that threshold, there really was no ability to continue it.

You may be relationship material for him if timing is right. But unfortunately, now is not the timing.

Also, he liked you. But ENTP's are not so driven by emotions that they would supersede their regular mission for a relationship, if the timing wasn't right.

Sorry to say, you have your answer. But that being said, there isn't some larger/grander thing that needs to be explained to you. This is the explanation. I would try to remember that although you have complex and deep feelings, there doesn't have to be a complex and deep reason for why something doesn't work out. 

I'm not sure if you are the type to try to stay in touch, because timing might change some day for him. But I probably would advise against it. There are other ENTP's out there, all of them awesome. I am good friends with a few and they constantly have a lot going on."
AskTrumpSupporters,fr05ubm,t1_fr04hdx,1589784655.0,"> Why don't you name this hospital then? The anecdote is meaningless otherwise. Still, there is a reason why people who oppose SRS can never give actual examples of the procedure being performed on children, no? If this were indeed happening, then you absolutely should be reporting said hospital.

I got an email on it today actually. Forwarded from my father. From that Children's Hospital. It is a top 10 Children's in the US.

Specifically, the procedures discussed were facial feminization procedures being performed by craniofacial surgeons. At a Children's Hospital. On minors. I know the names of the physicians. 

We are still very much in the nascency of knowing what will and will not be performed on children months, years from now.

If this isn't an actual example because you don't have proof from me then it isn't worth discussing further.

As to why you're not getting all the information you deem relevant, this is not information I wish to disclose. The Internet is a nasty place (especially this subreddit) and I have no desire of making it personal as well.

I don't come to ATS to debate clinical decision making. Certainly not with people who think this is an argument. I'm not here to argue. Just to show a different perspective, as well as hear the perspectives that others might have on a topic. Most of which aren't clinical decision making (thank goodness).

> Is this not arguing empty rhetoric? At its core, the goal is to alleviate gender dysphoria, in which SRS plays a pivotal role in doing so. Why are people opposed to that again?

I'm not sure whether you are grouping me in with your idea of conservatives in general. If people want SRS, by all means I support it. Just not on children."
AskTrumpSupporters,fr00fdn,t1_fqzv6kp,1589780158.0,"The medical community isn't perfect. I say this as a CEO of a care provider, and son of a physician who works in this arena. He operated on a transgender patient not two weeks ago and we talked about it recently.

My father works in a Children's Hospital deploying resources to gender reassignment surgery, with seemingly no restriction on age. These are concerning issues to both my father and myself.

If you want to argue the politosphere, you may well be right. I do not know the nuance of perspective on this narrow issue from the right, nor the left. I care about the medical deployment of resources to those who need it, and the perspectives driving this deployment. Which again, can sometimes be wrong.

If that makes me more on the left than the right, I wouldn't be surprised. But this is such a complex and emerging area of healthcare, culture, politics, and ethics that any actor thinking they have the high ground is surely overstepping. It will take us a long time to get this right on all of these levels.

Edit: Also, to answer your first question, the original commenter above claimed that changing the sex of your body cures gender dysphoria. My argument is that while the central struggle may be treated, the offshoots of the disorder are not. This would indicate it is not a cure, but a treatment."
AskTrumpSupporters,fqzqqfd,t1_fqzok6x,1589773161.0,"I think it's important that you identify the symptoms of gender dysphoria and assume that that central (and crucial) symptom of feeling uncomfortable with the sex of your body.

But I also agree with the original commenter. There are many studies done on this population and there are many other issues, even after transitioning. A body transition alone does not cure all the other mental health issues that come with gender dysphoria.

intj,fqu7yww,t1_fqt7js5,1589653780.0,"Two constants:

1. No guarantee of a cure
2. Federal govt refusing to take a leadership role

Given that backdrop, there are 3 possible paths forward, with one variable.

Path 1 is staying closed until we have a cure. This is absurd and has nothing to do with flattening the curve any more. It will destroy more human capital than the deaths if we allow this to run rampant through our society. We won’t have an economy to return to and the economic damage will cause more health issues than COVID.

Path 2 is equally bad. Reopening fully with no restrictions. We do not know the full pathology yet for cases that do not end in death. Clotting, lung damage, etc. The idea that we would take the virus head on and suffer the consequences would destroy our health system and have many lasting implications we are not aware of yet.

Path 3 is reopening the economy but carefully and in phases. Which is what most states are doing now, except GA and WI. If we have a sensible approach on this, the least amount of people are harmed by the two boogie monsters described in paths 1 and 2 above.

The one variable is testing. I cannot for the life of me find good data on how quickly our testing will ramp from here. We do not have enough testing now, even though we have the most in the world  (US). If we had a promise of fully robust volume by a certain date, we might be able to stay closed a bit longer to wait for it. But we have no leadership from the WH and therefore the indefinite waiting is too dangerous.

Most of our economy is built on leverage and has enough resources to be just-in-time. This is fragile and prone to disaster during even short shutdowns. You can’t just put somebody underwater for 5 minutes and expect them to be fine."

“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.” - Heraclitus

“It is your Work in life that is the ultimate seduction.” – Pablo Picasso

“Find what you love and let it kill you” -Charles Bukowski

“Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.” Bruce Lee

“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it's a feather bed.” — Terence McKenna

“His response was basically fourfold.  Paraphrasing, he said, first decide what you want.  Then he said decide what you’re willing to give up to get it.  Third, set your priorities.  And finally, he said, “Be about it.”  Right here is where the vast majority of people doom themselves.  They are not willing to sacrifice anything to achieve something better.  Neither are most of them willing to commit to that first step.” – H.L. Hunt, as paraphrased by Bob Eldridge

Regular counseling services charges $90 - 180 per hour, depending. We charge $60.

We also pay our staff well. Plus benefits. Been losing money since we opened.

**I started this company to make a positive change in the world. And only if we execute well, will we make a lot of money. I think that's how it should be.**

My worldview is that as a former mental health patient with multiple hospitalizations, and a deep love for business, these two can and should be married together. So far, I cannot find any capitalists in mental health. And it shows.

We want to expand access to treatment. To focus on underserved geographies, insurance plans others do not accept (medicaid), charge less for cash patients, and make things better than the higher priced health system. Long term the focus is to fix healthcare, but for now it is a small company."

AskTrumpSupporters,fkxtot0,t1_fkwvmir,1584635233.0,"I started a company that gives healthcare to poor people. It’s something I care about more than you could possibly imagine. The personal scar tissue I have from this could turn many a person into a villain in a Batman movie. My reasons to not vote for ACA version 2.0 with Biden are more nuanced than anyone. Healthcare is my domain and I intend to be the change I want to see in the world.

As for COVID, I’m not thrilled about it. No. But again, 1 in 100 year event. I’m not suddenly shocked at the person in charge. Simply very let down by it as a result of a tail risk event. I’d rather be ruined by tail risk than by someone who would ruin us during normal times.

I don’t blame you for your perspective. It isn’t necessarily the wrong one. This is one of the few times I’m not feeling condescending or superior to the other side of the aisle.

And to be clear, I’m a conservative without a lot of options. My best route is to try to save the small pocket of the world I live in and hope the federal government doesn’t continue seizing larger parts of the economy, whether directly or indirectly with legislation.

Trump has been atrocious. It may well cost him the election. But unless Biden changes his healthcare platform I won’t be voting for him."

AskTrumpSupporters,fkssydt,t1_fko1jlw,1584497667.0,"First, it is worth recognizing that there are many reasons to support one political party over the other. Yes it is a binary decision of GOP or Dem: in no way am I actually represented for more than, maybe, 20% of my views.

Did we go into this election with a 1-in-100 year biologic attack in mind? I am not saying China attacked us, I mean the human race is under attack by a biological agent. But if we did have this event in mind in 2016, then I would not have voted for Trump.

But I think it is not really the right attitude to look at a series of actions that confirm your hatred of someone, and expect it to fully flip the reasons others have for supporting them.

My main support for Trump is actually anti-support of the left. It is a vote against the alternative.

So far, pre-COVID, I am mostly ok with that vote. With COVID here, I'm not happy AT ALL with Trump in charge.

I'm not voting for a stock market president. I'm voting against a ""turn over the table"" president. I'm voting against the Green New Deal. I'm voting against M4A or ACA version 2.0. I'm not more for these things because of COVID. But I am also far less thrilled about Trump now.

From where I sit, it seems you think we shouldn't try to purchase vaccines. Or at least not in an exclusive way - as it would potentially damage our relations with other countries. I'm curious what the alternative would be? What your ideal alternative would be?

I often see from the right that if we give away vaccines for free then what would be the point of producing them in the future. What would then happen with our next outbreak? Which I think has a small amount of merit to it. But drug/vaccine development in the US has all the incentives wrong.
