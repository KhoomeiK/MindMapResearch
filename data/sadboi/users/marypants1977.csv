There is also Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, or HBOT, a medical treatment that delivers pure oxygen to the body under higher than normal pressurized environments. HBOT is a non-invasive treatment that enables increased oxygen levels to all areas of the body. While many people think of hyperbaric chambers and underwater divers with the bends, HBOT offers many different medical benefits and is available to treat many different conditions.

""Frontal lobes are considered our emotional control center and home to our personality.""

I do not have health insurance right now. I am returning to my home state where I believe I will be qualified for free medical assistance. Until then I am just toughing it out day by day.

My Chica had two litters as a stray. Brought in by Animal Control pregnant with her third litter. Pups were adorable. They adopted out right after weaning. She was devastated. Raising her own pups in the Wild Wild West as her style. She was sad and lonely when I met her. Folks go nuts over puppies. Nobody wanted the sweet ol' Mama dog.

She disliked children so much. One snarf at a little boy. My theory is she associated ""Humans take Chica pups. Chica bite human pups!"" Sadly she went to an American Boxer rescue in May, hopefully be adopted by a child free family after the second child she snarfed turned into a bite. That bite drew blood.
 
I feel guilty about her every day. I cannot bring myself to contact shelter and ask how she is. I only had her three months. We bonded after she was over her shelter shock. She was so lonely.
