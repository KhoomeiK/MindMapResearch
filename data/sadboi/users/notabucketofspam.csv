Theoretically the maximum mass would be roughly 60 Gt for a solid block of two million grav gens."
empyriongame,fokow2q,t1_fok3zhy,1587846143.0,Not demanding in terms of computer processing power but any blueprint will break if you have enough devices. I made a structure recently with 113792 gravity generators and it's still spawnable but when you add other things like core / CPU extenders / fuel tanks / generators it gets buggered up.

I recently built a structure that was just barely below the 10M point hard cap and it wasn't spawnable on any PC I tried. Maybe it's just a problem with my system but to be honest I sort of doubt that (R7 1600, 16 GiB DDR4, GTX 980TI), since it didn't work on an external MP server either."

The dimensions are such that the spherical effect field of the gravity generators (~~37.5~~ 75 blocks across) all converge onto exactly one point in the middle. There's a narrow tube running along the length of the structure in this spot, it's sort of like a barrel that the player places themself into to be launched. In theory, the player would simply navigate to the entry of the cannon, position themself inside the tube, and disable the jetpack to allow gravity to kick in."

I tried sertraline 50mg but it made me severely hypomanic which led to my diagnosis, and also tried escitalopram 10mg but it made me hallucinate / dissociate / suicidal / start self-harming and ended up getting me hospitalized.

BipolarReddit,fmaagch,t3_fttpbb,1585888118.0,"Personal anecdote: I (BD2) have been on aripiprazole (Abilify) for about a year now. Was initially put on 5mg to dampen hypomania but got bumped up to 10mg to prevent psychosis during depression. Took like six weeks before I started to see any results; less severe elevated states and no hallucinations. The side effects were uncomfortable for sure but not unbearable and they faded away after like two months, it was mostly nausea / fatigue. But if you develop akathisia (it's sort of like extreme anxiety and restlessness) like I did then please let your psychiatrist know, it's not fatal just really uncomfortable and distressing and there are meds that prevent it. Also like you I've been on several antidepressants (sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine) with only negative results. The aripiprazole didn't have any effect on my depression though, but your results may vary."
BipolarReddit,fma8mzc,t3_fthkf8,1585886687.0,"Might not be feasible with your psychiatrist / pharmacy, but you could try and see if you can get your doses divided into halves, like, take two 50mg pills instead of one 100mg pill. You could also try splitting the 100mg pill with a knife, mine have a little line down the middle for that."
BipolarReddit,fma7o5u,t3_ftfr1e,1585885953.0,"Can definitely relate to all this, my story's pretty similar to yours except that it all happened to me, like, a decade earlier in my life. Currently 20M, diagnosed with ADHD-PI at 11 and BD2 at 19, always struggled with problems of self-esteem / self-worth / sense of identity. Was given a bunch of antidepressants (sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine) that made things much much worse, like, causing self-harm and permanent psychosis / rapid cycling. Tried to cope with grey-market drugs (adrafinil, phenibut, anticholinergics) to no avail, still struggle with usage at times. I've personally found success with aripiprazole, lamotrigine, and low-dose amphetamine, but meds are different for everyone obviously. I really hope things go well for you with the new meds / psychiatrist. Good luck my dude."
BipolarReddit,fma5v44,t3_ftbjee,1585884606.0,"Here's a study on the chances of developing a rash due to lamotrigine: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312199/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5312199/). Given the statistics, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. The chance of dying because of lamotrigine is almost zero, and the rash doesn't always turn into skin necrosis, which itself is survivable with proper treatment anyways.

Personal anecdote, but I titrated from 0mg up to 200mg in under a month with no negative side effects; they aren't always a given with new meds (YMMV)."
bipolar2,fma0knf,t3_ftu9wx,1585880880.0,"I've been on aripiprazole for about a year, started at 5mg and moved up to 10mg two months later when I began having auditory hallucinations, and it's been very good at preventing both dysphoric hypomania and psychosis during depression. Although, the side effects (nausea, fatigue, akathisia) at first were hard to bear, but luckily went away after a few weeks. Just finished titrating lamotrigine up to 200mg last month, mood / energy has been more stable so far than at any point in the past year. For reference, I've tried three other meds for treating depression (sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine), each with very negative results.

That said, according to the Treatment Guidelines for Bipolar Disorder published by the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology (Fountoulakis et al., 2017), aripiprazole and lamotrigine are in fact not recommended to be paired together ([https://cinp.org/resources/Documents/Bipolar-Guidelines.pdf](https://cinp.org/resources/Documents/Bipolar-Guidelines.pdf), p.189), due to negative data in research trials. Medication adjustments are of course up to the discretion of your psychiatrist, but it may be useful to discuss the Treatment Guidelines between the two of you."
empyriongame,fm75913,t3_ft188a,1585813724.0,"Note: this is just my two cents, I'm not like a professional or anything but I build / sell low-cost gaming systems as a side gig (also, sorry for the wall of text).

Your system specs seem to be mostly fine with the major exception of the graphics processing unit (GPU). My friend's PC before he upgraded recently was actually equal to or worse than yours in most regards (he had a 2007 Intel E5440 @ 2.83GHz quad-core, 8GiB DDR3-1333MHz memory, Windows 7, with a super low-end SSD and ancient 5400rpm hard drive) except that he had a Nvidia GTX 570 (732MHZ base clock, 1280MiB GDDR5 on-board memory), and he was able to play at like 720p and around 40fps to 60fps. If you're looking to upgrade your GPU, you can grab one of those on Ebay for around $50, or alternatively a GTX 750 TI (which uses way less electricity) for a bit more. A longer-term solution would be a slightly-more-expensive GTX 670 / 760; the next tier up would be a \~$100 GTX 780 / 970, both of which can easily run Empyrion at 1080p 60fps.

Sidenote, but if you really wanted to improve the rest of your system, you could get something like: an Intel Xeon E3-1230 (drop-in replacement for your processor but faster and with more threads, it's like $40 on Ebay), two 8GiB DDR3 memory modules (maybe $70 total), a cheap SSD (Amazon, Inland 120GB $25 or 240GB $40), and depending on overall system electricity consumption a new power supply (EVGA B-Stock sometimes has \~700W $40 ones but only on wednesdays, you can use OuterVision PSU Calculator to find total power draw).

Something else you could do as a last resort is manually increase the size of the system paging file. This is a method of expanding the total amount of committable bytes (virtual memory used by programs) available on your PC by using a portion of a hard drive as memory (very simplified explanation). In Windows 7, it's in Computer -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Performance Settings (under Advanced tab) -> Change Virtual memory (under Advanced tab) -> uncheck ""Automatically manage paging file size for all drives"" -> select a hard drive -> enter some amount of MiB next to Custom size. My friend used like 16GiB (16384MiB) for the paging file (he had 8GiB of RAM), but that number kind of varies on a system-by-system basis. Also, set the Initial size and Maximum size to the same number (this prevents hard drive fragmentation) and set a single paging file for the entire system (this supposedly prevents random slowdowns / stutters). Semi-related: you could also disable Superfetch (Windows key + R -> services.msc -> Superfetch -> Properties -> Startup type: Disabled) to keep random background processes from using commit bytes (big maybe, it's very hit or miss). No guarantees that any of this stuff will fix your problem, but it's worth a shot I guess."
