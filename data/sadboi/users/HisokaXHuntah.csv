2) Most of the jobs I want to get are intelligence/analyst jobs. My number one job is 1n4xb1 (network intelligence analyst) but the rest of the jobs are other intelligence careers. How common is it to get these jobs out of DEPS? I understand it comes down to what the AF needs but are these types of jobs critically manned or are they something you wont be likely to get?"

The way I see it is: it's YOUR life and YOUR energy, which is a rare thing for a person with moderate to severe depression. My suggestion is to be conservative if you feel depleted and do what you can do recharge but also try to let your friends know what the deal is withotu coming off as blowing them off with no reason"

Combos or high damage moves at the cost of magic. A second player can also control her if they so desired! As for the items, understandable. Was trying to go for something different with the telekinetic grab. But I get why it would seem a bit out of place. The cleansing thurible is to deal with the undead in the game as well as those hellish monsters that live underground, effectively making the mobs and mini bosses easier to deal with.

A word of advice to the guys here. Don't ever, EVER give her another chance if she disrespects you like this. She obviously thought she could get away with things, take advantage of your trust and succumbed to her selfishness over your feelings. I was cheated on once (I even heard it happen, not a fun night) and she denied it to this very day. Girls like that will justify every reason for cheating on you and if they think they can get away with it, they will do it and just never admit it happened to ""spare your feelings"" - what great people, amirite?
