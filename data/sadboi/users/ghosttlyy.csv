mentalhealth,fimvrkj,t3_f8q5nx,1582548598.0,I’m suffering from major burn out due to my job. It’s very high stress and recently I’ve been thinking about leaving. None of my issues with depression started until I started this job. Sometimes it’s just not worth it. Your mental sanity is way more important. Take care of yourself and do something that makes you happy. If you find your depressive thoughts continue definitely try to get help if possible.

mentalhealth,fh7pn73,t1_fh7nmmc,1581341137.0,I will definitely read up on it and think about my motivations for taking it. Never thought about looking at it that way. Thank you.
