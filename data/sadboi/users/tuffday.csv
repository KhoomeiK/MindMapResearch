lonely,f80mjkc,t1_f80lk2k,1574132645.0,"Well even if you aren’t, your support is appreciated. Thank you"
lonely,f80ktcd,t1_f80jknr,1574131437.0,Absolutely correct. I guess I just hate to accept that fact.
lonely,f80jak8,t1_f80i0lz,1574130392.0,Yea it can be tough sometimes. I struggle making friends but I’ll try ig. Sometimes I feel all together  unimportant when she gets a new boyfriend. She seems to stop talking to me whenever it happens and she’s really one of my only friends so I feel a bit overlooked. Thanks you for the advice
lonely,f80j2k6,t1_f80igve,1574130238.0,I respect his POV deeply I just sometimes struggle to understand it. I would love to get a little older and marry my best friend. But that’s just me
depression,f7qkixj,t3_dx2la6,1573965288.0,I’ve seen a strong decrease in my ability to do basic math and my memory. I can’t seem to focus anymore and not much stuff in school makes sense to me like it used to
depression,f6v0k9d,t1_f6h4eey,1573173407.0,Ok. I’ll try it out. Thanks for your suggestion.
depression,f6v0izs,t1_f6haljz,1573173381.0,Yea I have a few playlists I enjoy. Thanks for the suggestion.
lonely,f6h4kxw,t3_dr0gdl,1572836894.0,I feel the same way. It seems my friends just ignore me or overlook me for someone else. All my opinions just get made fun of. I feel rlly lonely too. I hope it gets better for you tho.
depression,f6gyr0h,t3_del3c8,1572833135.0,I hope you know whatever you struggle with is incomparable to any other persons struggles. U r loved. That is all.
