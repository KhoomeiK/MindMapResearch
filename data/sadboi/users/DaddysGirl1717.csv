I highly recommend it as it saves a lot of the good good you want in your edibles that can burn off with other methods. You can also do it in the oven but I do 40 mins on 170 to preserve terps. There may be other methods but that’s mine. Also are you adding lecithin? I do a teaspoon while stirring over with melted butter over low heat (my electric stove setting is 3).
