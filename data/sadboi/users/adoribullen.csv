blackbutler,fqwlstr,t3_glbxj2,1589709195.0,once a month. released on the 18th.
FTMMen,fqvdayj,t3_gl3p2y,1589674852.0,"i grew up in the south and most of my family were southern baptist evangelicals. so i was raised very female. outside of school i mostly was in church. there everything was gender segregated for the most part. i didn't fit in well at all with the girls and women there but i had the same expectations as them put onto me.

being opinionated or outspoken was not frowned upon as long as it was done in a ladylike way. so i could speak my mind but it was much more difficult to feel respected when i felt like i always had to manipulate people into sympathizing with me. it's hard to describe but there's just a really particular way that women i grew up around expressed criticism and even to this day i mirror parts of that.

while that sticks out to me the most. i have a lot of feminine mannerisms (putting my hands on my hips, crossing my legs, etc) and i speak from my mouth not my chest. i also just expect to be treated like i'm fragile and need help. if i start passing consistently it will be difficult to adjust to not having doors opened or seats offered. 

besides these more ingrained things i think being raised female has had a big effect on my world view. since i grew up feeling lesser to my cis male peers and elders i was able to question sexually inequality in a way that wouldn't have happened if i had been raised male. i may have been able to come to similar conclusions but it would've taken much more time and would've happened much differently. i definitely experienced misogyny firsthand and had many women open up to me about their experiences with misogyny and sexism that wouldn't have done so if they had known i was male.

i feel very shaped by these experiences. i can understand that not everyone lived my lived experience but i do think more people were raised female than would like to admit it. i believe for some people they feel shame and dysphoria thinking about their past and that's understandable. but to me my past is still mine and i've accepted that it has given me different perspectives than most men."
FTMMen,fptnb88,t1_fptjczj,1588894483.0,"dysphoria is not a monolith. if some trans men want top surgery but not a hysterectomy or HRT that's their business. they could have a deeper voice naturally with not much bottom dysphoria. they could not have voice or bottom dysphoria at all. their fat placement could be exactly where they wanted it already. they could be passing 100% without HRT... etc.

OR they could be in a position where it would be difficult or impossible to get HRT so desiring it openly would do nothing but cause them more distress and dysphoria. so they tell others and themselves that they're okay without it because it helps them feel better.

OR they could not want HRT right now. due to fear of coming out. or due to other stresses in their life: a death of a relative, a birth of a new child, being recently married, being in the military, etc.

transitioning is about alleviating dysphoria. it's not a step by step process that is one size fits all. it's complicated."
BipolarReddit,fphniam,t3_gdfnc5,1588624401.0,"never having another episode is definitely not realistic. bipolar treatment is about making mood episodes less severe. the episodes could disappear entirely and you could go into remission but this isn't guaranteed. 

your treatment would likely work better with lifestyle changes which could possibly help decrease the severity of your episodes even more. a consistent healthy sleep schedule and sobriety from drugs and alcohol are the things i've personally found most helpful. it can be difficult to maintain but it's okay to slip up now and again. 

treatment for any chronic illness isn't just take a medication and you're instantly okay. recovery takes a lot of time and effort. treatment is lifelong. just communicate with your psych asap when you feel you're slipping into a severe episode."
dragonage,fpft79o,t3_gd15bb,1588582591.0,"i specifically made cole human because it went along with my inquisitor's stance on people's ability to change. cole being a spirit isn't the right way for him to be just because it was the way he used to be. he can be a spirit and feel complex emotions. he can evolve and change. he can move on from his past and forge a new future. ever since asunder he's learned more and more about himself. he's made friends and experienced more than just compassion. even if confronting his feelings and moving on is difficult it's still worth doing. 

this decision is also a lesson for solas. people are more complicated than they first appear and spirits can change their nature without becoming demons. he himself can change his prideful nature. he can admit that the world has moved on without him and the things that he changed by creating the veil didn't lead to a soley negative outcome. things can have both negative and positive results."
halsey,fp8lw42,t1_fp8amzb,1588395819.0,"she sees these same complaints on twitter and the only direct responses i've seen on the topic from her were through twitter PMs. her new label is in charge of halseyshop and for some reason couldn't even properly create some of the merch the label told her that they could (like the glitter vinyl and the marble sweater). after that bad merch was released she took absolutely everything except the ablums off the merch store run by UMG. she made sure UMG gave refunds to people who bought merch there and were unsatisfied. UMG also sent out [emails apologizing](https://twitter.com/ezgisaid/status/1220241472974397440?s=09)

the items still coming from that store like the blankets, hats, vinyls, tie dye hoodies, etc. are still ridiculously delayed and that store is very disorganized but new merch being released is not being handled through them any longer.

everything past the initial merch drop has been through halseymusicstore (the candles, the coloring book, the green hoodie, etc.) which to my knowledge typically sells her tour merch once tour is over and occasionally some promo items. 

i'm not sure who runs that store... it's also fairly slow but not the absolute clusterfuck that halseyshop was. a lot of the merch from halseymusicstore has already shipped in april or begun being shipped may 1st. there haven't been any quality issues with those items and any delays have been due to the virus.

i think she's said all that she's allowed to say at this point. i'm not sure how much she can speak publicly against her label while still being allowed to promote. she's also corrected the issue as much as she reasonably can."
halsey,fp7b3qb,t3_gbo8fa,1588367304.0,that's dope knowing she likely reads some of what we write. twitter is really clogged by comparison and her fandom there is dominated by fans she's personally met that she follows back. so it's hard for her to see everyone's perspectives there.
FTMMen,fozaizf,t3_gad22z,1588187415.0,i don't think anyone is going to clock you by name alone. if someone is reading your name on an online profile they'll likely look for photos or how other people are referring to you.
asktransgender,fopwh3t,t3_g8o935,1587974453.0,i'd look at other states in the northeast. you may be able to get a cheap apartment with roommates. i'd look around facebook groups and see if you can find lgbt friendly housing groups. i found my first apartment through the transgender housing tumblr (now defunct to my knowledge) and my second through a nyc lgbt housing group on facebook.
FruitsBasket,fol8le5,t3_g83kqm,1587857027.0,i don't mind waiting. i just hope i dont get spoiled in the meantime.
dragonage,fok38nu,t3_g7qe4a,1587834574.0,"1) i agree completely.

2 & 4) i have some disagreements and additions. the evanuris are indeed immortal but so were the rest of elvhenan. the biggest difference is the evanuris are all dragons like mythal. the evanuris (minus mythal) were trapped in the black city. they called magisters into the black city in order to gain their freedom. which worked but i am currently unsure why the arlathan became tainted by the blight. all i know is the blight at some point spread to titans and the evanuris were mining lyrium. so it was likely they at some point began using red lyrium. which was likely one of the big reasons solas sealed both the titans and evanuris. in an effort to contain the blight.

3) solas ""created"" demons. when he sealed the titans and evanuris an unintended side effect was essentially splitting the people in half. their mortal bodies in thedas and their immortal spirits in the fade. these spirits can become corrupted and become demons due to them losing their purpose by becoming obsessed with becoming whole again. leading to them to trick mages into possession."
rheumatoid,foiu3sg,t3_g7mi4b,1587797058.0,i use a fabric grocery cart. i just forgo bags altogether and put everything into the cart myself. it's much easier than carrying a bunch of bags since it can roll.
asktransgender,fo9rzj2,t3_g6hiqg,1587629082.0,"i definitely was even though i waited a very long time. i was relieved but also terrified. change can be very scary. it's normal to fear the unknown. 

i worried about all kinds of things: will certain changes even happen? what if i develop severe painful acne? what happens if i still can't pass, how will i feel? etc."
FTMMen,fnxgv1g,t3_g44o2z,1587338360.0,"i feel the same way. when strangers or acquaintances misgender me it's not really a big deal to me at all. when close friends or family do it i do get a bit upset but everyone i'm willing to have close to me always correct themselves. 

i just wanna be happy with myself really, so it's okay to me if people can't see what i see when i picture myself."
FTMMen,fnwmrob,t3_g49ysd,1587321367.0,"the best way to ensure you get the right level of care is to make sure you're seeing your psychiatrist and trying to stay on top of managing mood episodes. that way whenever anything is questioned by whoever is providing your trans related care you can say you are trying your best and are taking all of your meds on time as well as reporting when they aren't working as intended. which is all you can do really.

in terms of your therapist you have every right to fire them and find a new one if you don't vibe well. i don't see a therapist personally but i see a male psychiatrist through the trans clinic i go to for my endocrinologist. that has been a big game changer for me. in the past i had a lot of trouble being taken seriously since i was perceived as female. 

you may be able to find lgbt friendly therapists who specialize in bipolar disorder through NAMI if you can't find resources anywhere else."
rheumatoid,fnwkrkh,t3_g4bmom,1587320267.0,it helped me with nausea related to the pain but not the pain itself. only thc+cbd has ever helped with the pain itself and it doesn't work well all of the time.
rheumatoid,fnwk7j8,t3_g4a9vz,1587319957.0,"i was on cymbalta for a few years for nerve and muscle pain. the dizziness and nausea never went away for me, it caused sensitivity to light and sound, i had an excess of energy which caused me to go beyond my normal limits and then crash, and it also caused vivid dreams that made me feel like i never actually slept so i was exhausted all the time. it was very difficult to quit for me since i had undiagnosed bipolar disorder. i ended up having to use prozac to wean off and still ended up with very extreme mood episodes for nearly a year after stopping the medication.

it did however make my neuropathic pain and muscle spasms go away entirely. 

if you keep feeling bad after an extended period you may not see improvement. also it's important to be wary if bipolar disorder runs in your family. i've known two other bipolar people who took it who both had issues with vomiting and worse mood episodes. as well as my sister recently attempted suicide after her dose was increased and had to be taken off the medication entirely."
FTMMen,fni5l5n,t3_g1vcm7,1586974364.0,i also have to second mount sinai's center for advanced medicine. i see an endocrinologist there and they are fantastic. i did have to wait to be seen however. with the pandemic it may be an especially long wait.
blackbutler,fn950hs,t3_g0800p,1586759635.0,"in my interpretation of the manga, all the cultists did was draw a demon's attention. they followed the first two steps rejoice (raping ciel & his brother) and sacrificing ciel. and our ciel participated in both steps even if he was only a witness to the sacrifice. then ciel abandoned his belief in god, wishing that he could kill those who killed his bother. sebastian then answered his call and formed a contract. 

i think the words that were used to call out to sebastian were definitely necessary. as were the rejoice and sacrifice steps. what the cultists did wrong is they left our ciel alive. when the demon saw him, a young impressionable child, desperate and in mourning. forsaking god and declaring he'd kill those who killed his brother in a bloodthirsty rage. he really couldn't turn that down. he was definitely much more enticing than anyone else in the room.

i think it's likely he wouldn't have even shown himself without our ciel there. just because he was called didn't mean he had to answer. but he answered because our ciel was too interesting of a meal to pass up."
dragonage,fn79xa2,t3_fzzspr,1586716161.0,"people like the iron bull because he questioned the qunari. he liked the order and the structure. he liked his childhood and his home but when he saw the horrifying things that the qunari justified using the qun he didn't know what to do. the first time it happened in seheron he begged to be reeducated because he felt like it was something wrong with him that shook his faith in the qunari. the second time when his chargers were supposed to be sacrificed to test his loyalty, he realized the qunari cause wasn't something he just needed to believe in more. it was something he fundamentally disagreed with. he had two choices. save his family and start a new life (something that terrified him) or to suppress his feelings and submit to the qun.

about the qunari being ""retconned"". they weren't. no one and no codex is unbias in thedas. sten saying that women don't fight and the iron bull saying they do but they transition first are two people saying the exact same thing two ways. this happens very frequently through out the series. that is why you see a lot of conflicting information regarding the chantry, elves, and the grey wardens. it is one of the defining traits of the series."
halsey,fn70n8o,t3_fzrwg2,1586710995.0,i think it's likely it'll be cancelled at this point. everything is canceling just to be safe. i'm just unsure where she'll end up holding the show..if it isn't done in the summer she will not be able to play in forest hills. so there will be a venue change and likely full refunds if she reschedules.
FTMMen,fn6zdu2,t3_fzzn9c,1586710311.0,i dont think this is related to HRT. you should have a talk with your general practitioner when you're able.
dragonage,fn3zkzs,t3_fz8w1x,1586631044.0,"as far as a female solas goes that's essentially briala since their back stories and cleverness mirror each other. and as far as i can tell she's fairly popular with those who've read the masked empire. 

i do think however that sera and vivienne would be perceived much more positively if they were male. if they were more attractive to straight female players their perspectives and actions would be forgiven or overlooked more easily.

a female cullen would be treated like sera most likely. he's fairly hypocritical and is very insistent that his views and feelings are the only ones that matter. especially since celene seems to be viewed negatively by people who've read the masked empire.

the fandom is already fairly split on who likes anders and who doesn't. i don't think changing his gender would change too much. i think it would flip some people's opinions on both sides so it would likely even out."
blackbutler,fmwtc6w,t3_fxweca,1586452673.0,if anything compromises the contract they'd be upset but otherwise i don't think they care about each other.
FTMMen,fmtdtfh,t3_fxbduh,1586371041.0,"in terms of repression i had a similar experience. i didn't experience puberty late (i actually started it in the third grade) but every time anyone suggested i looked male or acted male i was terrified. i had been trying so hard to do everything i could to be female and i was awful at it. i was made to feel shame over it on and off my entire childhood. there was a lot of ""why can't you be more like the other girls"". it hurt me so much because i wanted to make everyone else happy and i was failing. 

i fell into a similar trap when i started my transition. i was going to be the best version of a boy that i could think of. make up for lost time. i'd make everyone happy for me and proud of me by being what they wanted. it made me miserable. i was trying to be everything but myself for so long i didn't even know how to be myself anymore.

now that im much older i feel like i came out the other side better for realizing that being what other people want won't make me happy. people aren't as accepting of me now. im misgendered constantly but i can finally say that im happy with who i am. even if i feel uncomfortable in my own body ive learned to love the things about me i used to hate. the things that society told me that made me too masculine to be a woman and too feminine to be a man. im me now and if people don't like it i dont live for their comfort or happiness anymore. i live for mine.

we didn't have the same story but i'm hoping this could helps others too. i really don't see repression talked about much at all in ftm circles."
BipolarReddit,fmg6fxx,t1_fmg60dt,1586042246.0,"i was agreeing with you sorry it came off weird. i didn't think you thought she had bad intentions, inspiration porn just seriously sucks. i hate that it seems to be the only way things get through to people. so celebrities end up feeding into it without even trying."
BipolarReddit,fmg5fqu,t1_fmg1a71,1586041650.0,"i agree. she didn't say she had it in order to be told she was brave. we need to focus on the harsh realities of things that are so stigmatized and misunderstood. that's why people come forward. to bring awareness of people affected by bipolar who are less fortunate and have less resources than celebrities. they aren't role models they're just speaking up about something that they've struggled with that's difficult to talk about due to stigma.

it's best for people to just say i'm glad she was able to speak her truth and leave it at that. it's not awesome or heroic."
FTMMen,flyylo8,t3_fs03wn,1585611762.0,the most effective method can vary person to person. for me depo-provera was really helpful. it'd be worth talking to a doctor about to see what they think would work best for you. the trans clinic i go to has an obgyn. it'd be worth looking into your local resources and seeing if you can find a trans friendly doctor.
FTMMen,flq8bcy,t3_fqfgjo,1585383373.0,"i waited an extremely long time (a decade) to start HRT due to health reasons, but i originally intended to wait three years. i spent a lot of time reflecting on why i felt dysphoric and how to make myself feel better. hormones ended up being something i wanted,  but i felt much less desperate to start HRT the longer i waited. it isn't something i really see said online but my dysphoria mellowed out much more with age.

i don't know how common that is but my husband is also trans and felt the same way. he's been doing HRT for 7 years now but says like me it wasn't really the HRT that helped the most. a lot of healing from your dysphoria is self acceptance. 

if you feel better just being masculine great. if you want to transition that's great too. whatever makes you more comfortable is what you should do and giving yourself time to reflect can be a really positive thing."
NorthCarolina,flatnsl,t1_flaqctu,1584990898.0,all states do afaik but the requirements change depending on the state. some do not allow work or childcare obligations as an excuse.
asktransgender,fl9cvyt,t3_fncrae,1584949981.0,"ive done both things at different points in my life. when i first started to realize i was male i tried to jump hard into being perceived as femme and not butch (because at the time i was being perceived as a lesbian). i got a really strong response from it too. people thought i looked great and i kept getting compliments but i felt like garbage because of how i was being perceived. it made me feel much worse.

then after i came out i jumped hard into masculinity. harder than i had before. i was passing all the time. only people who knew me personally ever knew i was female. but i never wore anything i actually liked. my hair cuts and clothes were always determined by what would look the most male. it also made me feel like garbage.

for me what i got from this was that i needed to stop caring about people thought of me and focus on what i think about myself. i think i look male and i dress how i like. i do get misgendered 100% of the time now and it can be upsetting when it's people close to me. but i'm happier this way than either of the other ways."
asktransgender,fl9ca15,t3_fnbgx8,1584949222.0,"it depends on the size of their chest but a well made sports bra should prevent most or sometimes any movement. i've heard really good things about this [bra](https://www.amazon.com/Glamorise-Womens-No-Bounce-Camisole-Wirefree/dp/B0035WTMF4?th=1&psc=1) for C size or larger. if they're smaller they may be able to find something locally. [dick's sporting goods](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/f/high-support-sports-bras) has a really good selection of sports bras that should prevent movement.

asktransgender,fl9befq,t3_fndprk,1584948138.0,"as a young child i collected sweet streets doll houses. i had an entire neighborhood. i loved all the barbie movies, bratz, and my scene. i had an obsession with heeled boots and leopard print. all my close friends were girls. so i didn't have any of the stereotypical ""signs"". i had so many signs i was cisgender and not trans that my father had plenty of ammo to throw in my face until i left home and moved in with my mom at 16. 

i didn't have any obvious signs until puberty started. i didn't even notice my own dysphoria until i was 15. looking back at photos from my tween and teen years it was pretty clear i was uncomfortable with my body and wanted to be perceived as male subconsciously. but i think everyone around me just thought i was a lesbian. and i did too until i realized i was just male.

i think a lot of the ""signs"" are based in gender roles more than anything else. i never disliked being girly i just wasn't a girl. so it wasn't really obvious until puberty that i was trans since i was really comfortable with traditionally female gender roles. what started to make it obvious was my discomfort with female puberty, people's perceptions of me, and my own appearance."
FruitsBasket,fl9ab52,t3_fn6i0w,1584946837.0,"im a non-manga fan. i watched the first anime but i believe that was all covered in the first season of 2019.

i can't tell much about the girl in the hospital or the student council members introduced in the trailer. but the hat that tohru has is from yuki. i thought that was already directly addressed? not that they've spoken about it to each other but the memory of that day it was shown on screen from both of their perspectives unless i'm remembering wrong. 

the thing that's intrigued me the most is akito and shigure's relationship. they have a lot of weirdly romantic tension. like it feels uncomfortable to witness?? shigure seems to dislike akito but visits them often. i know akito is the head of the family but it seems like shigure is manipulating them with some goal in mind. i think it's related to that dream he had but never really described. he seems to be manipulating everyone through akito mostly but he's also done it brazenly. i'm very bad at quoting things but he said something to kyo when kyo was about to leave his house that was downright nasty. like a rubbing salt in his wounds kind of thing. so i'm really excited to see where things go with shigure.

with akito specifically im assuming the next season should touch on their relationship with yuki more. i'm not really sure why they ended up entangled the way that they are. i know yuki was being punished for transforming in front of people but there's got to be more to it than just that. 

im also looking forward to seeing more of yuki and tohru. not because i want them to date but the opposite. he seems unhealthily attached to her. like he's got this idealized version of tohru in his head or he's convinced the outside persona he's created would like a girl like tohru. i'm assuming it has to do with the hat thing somewhat. like he fell in love with what he felt like that girl could be but doesn't realize the image he's created isn't who tohru actually is?

lastly i just really wanna know what happens at the beach everyone keeps freaking out about the beach lol. my prediction is ill cry. a lot."
NorthCarolina,fl84u71,t1_fl83sul,1584915898.0,"i don't think you understand that some people work multiple jobs and cannot make the cut offs at all and do not have any free time for early voting. many people under 30 cannot afford health insurance, phone, water, electric, rent, internet, and groceries without having two jobs with no off days.

there was also very little education surrounding voting when i was in school. all i was told was that i could sign up at the DMV and that's it. nothing about absentee ballots or early voting. the people who can show up for early voting under 30 likely don't even that it exists in the first place. and if you don't think ignorance is an excuse then we just agree to disagree. there needs to be more education surrounding how to vote and what people's options are. then we'll likely see an increase in young voter turnout but it won't be too much because of what i said before. the minimum wage would need to increase and allow people to work less in order to see drastic changes in voter turnout."

BipolarReddit,fkrjmy0,t1_fkrj6go,1584470164.0,yep exactly. it's so painfully obvious. i'm sitting on a train coming from manhattan right now and it's full of people in their work uniforms wearing gloves and masks just praying they don't catch it because they still have to pay their bills. meanwhile people with high paying office jobs can work remotely and are all quarantined.
BipolarReddit,fkri3hw,t1_fkqwpj7,1584469308.0,"i'm not sure where this idea of physically ill people being coddled comes from. i think this may be a grass is greener on the other side thing. i have BD1 and an autoimmune disease. i promise you my family and former friends just had double the reasons to call me weak, lazy, and a burden. the same advice of just go on walks, go on a diet, pray it away, etc. are all proposed to me as cures to my physical illness and the reason it's not better is because i'm not trying hard enough. this response to physical disability isn't uncommon either. some people just aren't empathic to other people's struggles when they haven't experienced them personally. 

you'll still get fired for physical problems too. my father was when i was younger and he became disabled. his job just made another reason to fire him. they made it look legit and there was no fighting it. 

the reason people are staying inside now is just because it's contagious by touch. when the AIDs crisis was in full swing the government and society at large didn't care at all since minorities were the main groups affected. you don't get AIDs or BD from touching surfaces and it mainly affects minority groups so society and the government don't care because they personally aren't at risk."
halsey,fkgf2br,t3_fi7o0t,1584157804.0,"im not sure why you think she'll need to cancel a lot of it. she isn't going to japan or korea until may and the US leg starts in june. that's plenty of time for the corona virus pandemic to die down. there is no guarantee that it will but there's no reason to think she'll absolutely have to cancel either. 

in general tho on her break she was saying she wanted to catch up to everyone she'd seen growing and changing. because she feels like she's stagnated a lot. so she'll likely be focusing more on herself and less on her career. maybe going back to school? or picking up a new hobby. she could even get more into her art and dedicate her time to painting.

she's definitely going to focus on her friends and her boyfriend the most. which is a good thing. she's spent so much time just focusing on her image and her fans and her music. she'll definitely still work a little. maybe put out an emo EP. but it sounds like she just wants a change of pace so she can grow on a personal level."
rheumatoid,fkfcuhg,t3_fi5laj,1584131631.0,i personally think you should take extra precautions (because being sick with RA sucks in general) but like everythinghurt5 said treatment is what makes you vulnerable so i wouldn't worry too much. it's just possible that if you get the virus you would feel more crappy than those around you but it wouldn't increase the likelihood of complications.

todayilearned,fkaaeg4,t1_fka9tyr,1583998928.0,"there are a lot of similarities but manic and depressive episodes aren't something that schizophrenic people experience unless they have schizoaffective. i'm definitely of the mindset though that bipolar and schizophrenia exist on a spectrum (with schizoaffective in the middle). they're definitely extremely similar, enough that they likely have very similar (or possibly the same) cause.

i think the misdiagnosis of schizophrenia when someone actually has bipolar tends to come from the misconception that psychosis = schizophrenia. but there are definitely biases involved in any diagnosis involving class, race, and gender."

i also feel really bad that she ended up tweeting such harmful things, for both her and her father. it just sucks all around because she definitely was at the time completely convinced. she's likely very embarrassed and upset and has possibly permanently ruined her relationship with her father. i just hope her treatment has worked well and things have been mended as much as they can be. he must have felt so worried, confused, and upset. seeing someone you love act unlike themself is terrifying."
FTMMen,fk86yu4,t3_fgvwco,1583950523.0,i recently started testosterone and am diagnosed with bipolar 1. it hasn't really affected anything mood wise for me so far. it didn't trigger any kind of episode and my symptoms are not better or worse. my endocrinologist specifically told me when i received my t prescription that he believed gender dysphoria and bipolar could be treated simultaneously with no issues as they're unrelated. so i wouldn't worry too much.
asktransgender,fk4s165,t3_fgfusu,1583866467.0,"a close friend of mine detransitioned. when they initially started their transition they knew they weren't their agab but didn't ever talk to anyone about it. i believe it was because they never really felt comfortable talking about any kinds of feelings. after starting hrt they felt worse rather than better. much more insecure about how they looked and felt and they realized over time they just weren't a binary trans person at all. so they went off hormones and present primarily as their agab now but consider themself nonbinary. 

now, as to how i felt about it. i'm really happy for them. it was confusing at first because i didn't meet them until after their transition started. but they really are a much more confident and happy person now. i know they regret not speaking about things with a gender therapist longer than what was required at the time for a referral to an endocrinologist. and i agree with them that they definitely should have opened up more and got to the bottom of their dysphoria before starting HRT. but it all worked out for the better in the end. a lot of people abandoned them completely after their detransition. people who only liked the idea of them and not who they actually were. so now they not only know more about themself, they also have much better support system."
BipolarReddit,fjeivq4,t1_fjehfpt,1583272516.0,"no it doesn't have to be all the time. schizoaffective consists of psychotic episodes (of at least 2 weeks) and separate mood episodes(depressive and/or manic). for a schizophrenia diagnosis you need to have 6 months of continuous hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. but that's not required for schizoaffective. so it's definitely worth talking about with your psych."

rheumatoid,fjbb4bn,t3_fcbvu4,1583189683.0,"before i knew i had rheumatoid arthritis i did a lot of things to try to help my every day symptoms and flares. they really didn't help much at all. my knees were still so swollen it was difficult to walk or stand for any meaningful amount of time.

i got cranialsacral therapy for around a year. it helped with fatigue and nerve pain primarily. i tried seeing a chiropractor, by the fourth appointment i was in so much extra pain it was obvious it was just making things worse. i smoked marijuana, but which helped with nerve pain and fatigue but also helped with appetite. i cut gluten and nightshades out of my diet. that helped my symptoms the most as i couldn't do anything at all when i ate either trigger food. 

since starting DMARDs and humira ive been able to eat whatever i want and dont have trigger foods. gluten can still make me sick occasionally but nothing like before.

humira temporarily put me into remission for a few months. changing your diet and seeing holistic practitioners could be beneficial for some people alongside DMARDs and biologics, but definitely cannot work on their own to put someone into remission."
rheumatoid,fj5uxn6,t3_fbjnlb,1583044036.0,"since you're concerned about a possible joint related autoimmune disease you need to see a rheumatologist. you're having joint pain and there's a family history so that's more than enough reason to have them check you out. they're the only kind of doctor who's gonna be able to give you some peace of mind. they can run more specific tests.

just as someone with RA the only things jumping out at me are the joint pain and dry mouth. i'd put emphasis on those things and the fatigue when meeting with a rheumatologist.

i wish you the best with figuring out what's going on. it all sounds very overwhelming and hopefully you'll be able to find a treatment plan that works for you soon."
rheumatoid,fj2ytzj,t3_fb7zso,1582959213.0,"it's still very possible you could have inflammatory arthritis. i have muscle and joint pain as part of my disease course. i was initially misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia because of this. it just turns out my inflammation and swelling was more around my joints than inside them. but still very much RA.

if your doctor only ran your RF factor then you have more tests to be done with a rheumatologist. even if those come back negative it's still possible you could be seronegative.

it's really all about your symptoms. bilateral joint swelling, stiffness, and/or redness is typical. small joints like your hands, wrists, feet, or chest are effected first. morning stiffness for the first hour or so after you wake up. if any of that sounds familiar make sure it's mentioned to the rheumatologist.

just make sure if there's any doubt surrounding your diagnosis do not get fibromyalgia put on your file. it is a diagnosis of exclusion which means it should only be diagnosed if your doctors are 100% sure it's whats wrong with you.

i had it on my file for years and it meant every health problem i had was downplayed or ignored and nothing else was ever investigated. i definitely don't recommend that."
BipolarReddit,fj1lz3z,t1_fj1dmoz,1582922846.0,"liver toxicity seems to be my doctor's main concern. i have an autoimmune disease that has me on another liver toxic medication. so it's not advisable for me to be put on lithium. i also have chronic issues with electrolyte imbalance (which causes frequent dehydration) and loose stools. which also increase the risk of liver toxicity when taking lithium. 

it also doesn't play well with some thyroid issues as well as some heart issues. so i believe it's unpopularity has to do with pre-existing conditions as well. 

since there are options that are not toxic those tend to be favored especially for people like me with other health concerns."

OutOfTheLoop,fhnbgfa,t1_fhm5slq,1581724445.0,"what you and he are both describing are women who are bad at explaining their own symptoms since they have no idea what is clinically relevant. they are instead communicating the symptoms which cause them the most distress and because of that come off ""insistent and demanding"". 

i know that because i was one of those people. it turned out that i just had rheumatoid arthritis. which is a common and treatable autoimmune disease, but when all i could say was ""it's really difficult to walk i just get so exhausted and i'm so nauseous i can't eat much if at all"" it was impossible to diagnose. 

it took until i had done some of my own research for me to be able to explain that i thought i may have some kind of autoimmune disease. once i could explain it, i did. and then my GP promptly ignored me. i tried going to other GPs but kept getting people running ANA and RF blood work and nothing else with no referral to a specialist. 

by the time i found someone who would listen it was in the most unlikely place. i met a female doctor with crohn's disease who worked at an urgent care clinic. she sent me to her rheumatologist immediately. testing my anti-CCP made it clear i had rheumatoid arthritis and i began treatment, but as it was nearly a decade late it's taken years to make decent progress.

it turned out my knees were severely swollen and had baker's cysts that even after 3-4 years of treatment the swelling has just finally started to go down. the disease has also spread to every single joint i have.

while some people may be stressed and CBT may be extremely helpful, it's likely these women have issues expressing their symptoms in a clinical way and so their needs are being overlooked. misogyny is the epidemic it's not some unknown disease."
rheumatoid,fgn2kht,t3_eze9xm,1580936477.0,"i just moved from concord, nh last year. my rheumatologist was based in manchester with cmc. but they're actually now in the process of opening their own practice. their name is dr. todd daughtery. my husband and i just threw out the mail i received talking about the new office (otherwise id give you that information) but if you call his current practice they can definitely direct you to his new one.

i was recommended to him because i spent years with fatigue and stomach problems. i told an urgent care doctor i thought it could be autoimmune but my gp didn't believe me. she herself had crohn's disease and saw dr.daughtery. so she sent me to him.

he takes very thorough notes all articulated into the system so you can hear what's being written as it happens. he got my full medical history and after my blood work came back seropositive he immediately started me on DMARDs and then right before i left humira. every time something failed we'd rethink everything together and come up with a new medication regimen. he's very proactive and aims for remission. whenever i was flaring he encouraged me to come in right away so we could get me on my feet again.

so essentially i highly recommend him. if i could've kept him when i moved out of state i would have."

BipolarReddit,ffbaus8,t1_ffb6hnf,1579757864.0,"it's definitely not an unpopular view. but when bipolar disorder is diagnosed this early it's due to extreme difficulty functioning in the child effected. and treatment is started in order to prevent worsening of symptoms in their adult life.

sadly my older sister was not diagnosed with bipolar specifically until she was much older. but from late elementary she frequently expressed she wanted to kill herself. and that life had no purpose. she'd have so many days she couldn't even move from her bed until the day was almost half way over. it was awful. she felt horrible and had a lot of problems functioning.

it was fairly clear that she was severely depressed. this continued until her adult life despite life style changes and therapy. now she's on medication and doing much better as an adult. but she shouldn't have had to spend so much of her life under that much emotional stress. and now she has very bad episodes of both mania and depression off of medication that could be more mild had medication been considered earlier. 

if you don't want to take my word for it [here's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3835470/) a study on the topic that concluded, ""BP disorder exists in youth, but it is difficult to diagnose.

being masculine isn't what it means to be a boy. you can be feminine with short hair. you can still dress just as you are now. you can have the same interests and the same hobbies. you can just be a boy and do those things. i've been living as male for ten years. made friends, gotten married, and learned how to ease my dysphoria and be true to myself.

i really think you'd benefit from gender therapy. it helped me a lot when i first started seriously considering transitioning. talking about my feelings with someone experienced helped me loads. 

while you don't have to be binary you don't have to be non-binary either. give yourself time to think. make any changes you're comfortable with at a pace you're also comfortable with. learn how to love yourself. you'll know whether you're trans or cis in time. i know it's scary but being kind to yourself very often is. but your happiness is worth it."

psilocybin is safe the way that antidepressant drugs are safe. for some people antidepressants can trigger things like manic episodes or suicide attempts due to undiagnosed bipolar disorder. psilocybin can also cause severe and prolonged hallucinations and delusions in people with undiagnosed bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. which is what happened to your brother. not everyone has the same triggers. your brother was just very unlucky he ended up causing symptoms to show up earlier than if he hadn't used shrooms."

im so sorry your coworker ended up in a similar situation. worldwide there are a lot of issues with how treatment of complex mental illness is handled. not only societally but also the system itself is still very broken. i've known of people who could talk psychiatrists and police out of any trouble they got themselves into. it's fairly difficult for people like that to get the help they need. this man's insistence that he's fine and his ability to communicate coherently is likely enough to make him unable to be sectioned at all. 

im really sick of all of this too. there absolutely has to be a way to stop things from getting this far. but education about complex mental illness is just not very good with the general public. so family can't see the signs in their loved ones and even if they do don't know what resources are available to them. the same issue exists with police and even some mental health professionals. until there's significant change more and more people will be hurt. and it's just so awful."

asktransgender,fa82njf,t1_fa81wsr,1575840516.0,"shared experience is one thing. saying we are all one people is another. thats why movements like that one exist, although it's not something that i support.

trans men are not free to do the same thing. read through other replies on this thread. if someone were to say there's a fundamental difference between cis and trans women it's inappropriate. it implies they are not women. which was my point. it's inappropriate to do it in either direction."
asktransgender,fa80n87,t1_fa7yj0i,1575839882.0,"i think you're missing what my point was. you're doing the same grouping for the same reason. and your reason is that you believe lesbians, trans men, and trans women are all ""like you"". you're claiming the common denominator is that they are lgbt. but that grouping is an alliance of different groups coming together to fight oppression. it is not one thing we all are, but many different communities of people working together towards a common goal.

at the end of the day you're still grouping cis women and trans women together but not cis men and trans men. instead grouping trans men with women. despite intentions, it will hurt people's feelings and make them feel misgendered."
rheumatoid,fa7tfla,t3_e7yeel,1575837983.0,afaik yes. im not even in remission anymore but i was for around a month. once humira became effective for me all my bloodwork is flawless. even after i started having small flares again. it likely means your disease is more controlled than before.
asktransgender,fa7rd1a,t1_fa7iaja,1575837352.0,"speaking over an entire thread full of transmen with a contrary opinion like this is incredibly rude and uncalled for. you're saying that these men can't accept another perspective but neither can you. take the criticism, think about it, and go."
asktransgender,fa7ofxi,t1_fa6lg54,1575836610.0,god thank you so much for saying this. this has been out of hand here for so long. if it continues there really needs to be some adjustments to the rules because this has become a space that is very very hostile to trans men.
asktransgender,fa7n9n0,t1_fa6w5tt,1575836310.0,as someone whos a transman who doesnt pass and is constantly misgendered outside of the community as female and inside of it as a nonbinary. it's 500% grouping nb and transmen with women. stop talking over transmen just because you're upset a mod is saying something and shutting down the soft boy/testosterone poisoning/i-hate-men circlejerk.
