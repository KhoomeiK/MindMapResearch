AskReddit,ez24gmr,t3_cx82u8,1567652531.0,"This is my last semester of undergrad and I’m honestly having a hard time trying to finish. I try to study, but I legit can concentrate for shit. Also, I don’t really want to interact with anyone. I know I should be excited to graduate, but school is probably the reason for my anxiety and depression. This shit sucks"
