We know they may repeat mistakes. We know they may be awkward, and uncertain..perhaps unwise...just as we love them for their wonder, innovation, imagination, and exploration. Past you is but a child that needs your forgiveness and love so that present you can continue to grow and evolve into future you.

UnsentLetters,fqansv5,t1_fq96u6p,1589222211.0,"Btw, I wasn't saying they shouldn't distance themselves, simply asking why they were.

Everyone has moments in life where they need time to themselves, even from people they really care about. Sometimes, especially from those people.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that it's better to let the person know out of respect for them. Something as simple as ""hey don't worry but I am gonna take a few days to myself, got a lot on my mind, I'll call you when my head is clear"" goes along way, and is usually how I handle it when my quiet times are questioned, or I know they may freak someone out. 

But sometimes we don't even have the emotional capacity to do that. Sometimes we need to figure ourselves out and get our heads straight, because we have lives outside of other people. And that's okay. Everyone copes and processes differently, and being able to take a step back is healthy. 

I know sometimes I need to distance myself too. We all do it.

demisexuality,fpwofy8,t3_gfo62c,1588967050.0,"I am a demisexual.

I have had hookups. 

Demisexuals are *often* on the asexual side because they don't feel attraction before emotional connection, etc. 

*But* there are demisexuals who have been closeted, ( or who tried to fake it to make it and fit in) , or choose to have sex despite lack of attraction other reasons. 

It's not up to us to judge whether or not someone is, or isn't, demisexual, especially if they are still figuring out their personal sexuality, wants, needs, etc.. 

Could it be a ploy? Sure. But I highly doubt that someone who stated in their profile that they are monogamous and looking for something serious would be using it as a tactic to get nudes or whatnot...seems more like someone just trying to navigate the modern dating landscape as best as they can despite not quite feeling they fit with the status quo. 

Attraction and arousal are not the same thing. Sometimes demisexuals masturbate, but we aren't attracted to our vibrators. It's the same for hookups...only you're masturbating with another human in a consensual fashion. 

I can honestly say that maybe 4 of the people I've been physically intimate with would fit the preconceived demisexual criteria (the rest were rape, date rape, statutory rape, or eh fuck it I need to pretend). But I had to go through all of that to realize what I have been this entire time.

Sexuality is a very personal thing, and can have many layers to it. I really think that labels are dangerous when they start to feel like an exclusive club, when honestly they're really just there to help us figure out, and define, ourselves."
