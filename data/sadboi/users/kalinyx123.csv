raisedbynarcissists,fp4tc8k,t1_fp2xch4,1588306869.0,"wow, that brought back memories I remember polishing the stairs with my brother because we were expected to clean when mom was out socializing all morning( i don't remember exactly what she was doing)  i was 6 or so. The furniture polish smelled like orange so I licked some, (because hey if it looks & smells like orange, it should taste like it too). And getting spanked and yelled at  ""for being stupid"" when my brother told mom I had licked some ( though they didn't tell me why I shouldn't have)."
offmychest,fp4skzr,t1_fp49kid,1588306316.0,"please be aware that while some side effects might not justifying taking meds for you, other people might have a diffrent tolerance. I know a couple diffrent people who don't take their meds because it puts them in a manic state and they don't sleep for 2-3 days then crash. The previous meds did the opposite and they slept for 14+ hours a day ( making it difficult to work), other ones caused debilitating migraines, and i recall them mentioning vertigo to the point they couldn't stand when they were first put on meds as a teen. SO Yes, some side effects just aren't worth it for some people.
That doesn't even scratch the surface for people who just can't afford their medication."

It was an eye opening when someone brought it up with me, because while I was in the midst of a panic attack I had no concept of how my actions affected others. Someone actually having the guts to talk about it pushed me into trying to get help."
raisedbynarcissists,fndh3u0,t3_g0uop5,1586869853.0,"ok, wow. So I didn't even realize that this wasn't normal. I'd bein my room, usually because there was an argument going on downstairs and then mom would come to my room insisting that I go downstairs to join the family. Or demanding to know why I was angry at her, because clearly that is the only reason I wouldn't want to be in he middle of another argument."

Now I am fat because i have unhealthy eating habits and a messed up view of junk food because it used to be something I was never allowed to have. Kids often get chocolate at holidays, I would get fruit or breakfast shakes."
