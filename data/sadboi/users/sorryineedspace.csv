relationship_advice,evcfmef,t3_cj9bm5,1564414103.0,"I'm sorry, but when THOUSANDS of people are telling you, YOU'RE in the wrong, maybe listen? Your argument really just baffles me.

I'm a 21 year old female and not having a lock on my door to my only private space would be horrible, ESPECIALLY if I had a 6 year old sibling who liked to barge in whenever they pleased. 

I still live at home and I really only lock my door if I'm changing, or want to be alone, but when people barge in unannounced when my door is unlocked, It's so upsetting.

Your teenage daughter needs a lock. She asked for one because she needs a place she feel like she can completely be alone. Not having a lock isn't cutting it. 

Since you have such a huge ass issue with allowing your own kid her own privacy, you can always keep a spare key incase you need to use it. You can also always have a trial run. Maybe give her a lock on her door for a few weeks and see how it pans out. You are the parent and she does reside under your roof, but prepare for your daughter to resent you if you don't see eye to eye with her or at least come up with some sort of solution. 

Stop trying to seek validation from others. You are the parent, and if something is creating tension between you and your daughter, you need to at least try to understand her. 

""I'm afraid of what she might be doing when she locks her door."" What if she just has had a really bad day and just needs to cry it out alone in her room without the embarrassment of being seen? What if she's changing? What if she's studying and wants to make sure no one breaks her concentration? I can give you a million examples as to why she might want a lock for her door, and none of them point to her causing trouble."

Anxiety,epm7d2u,t1_epl1tkq,1559309088.0,"The best you can do is just put in your two weeks. If they ask maybe just say something along the lines of, ""I found a higher paying job that works well with my schedule and it's something I really need right now."" That's the reason I gave my old job. They shouldn't ask for more details, it is none of their business. I really dont advise just leaving without notice, it's really not good to burn any bridges you have professionally, no matter how insignificant they may seem. But, if you have to for whatever reason, feel like you absolutely cannot stick it out for two weeks, do what is best for you. Also keep in mind it may take some time finding the job that fits you!

I'm sorry I'm not much help, but if there is someone trustworthy enough in your friend group try to talk to them. You can say something along the lines of, ""Hey I'm having a lot of anxiety right now, and I am feeling a little left out. I value our friendship and if I have done anything wrong, I would really like to know."" 


I'm not sure if this is what you mean, but often I feel like I come across as disingenuous or deceitful. I know that is not the case, but I suffer from anxiety, and usually It helps if I talk about it with my best friend."
