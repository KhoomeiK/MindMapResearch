I'm also going to come up with everything else that I want to add to my island. I already have a gym, a lighthouse, a small cafe area that I could improve, a carnival that could use some TLC, a park and a couple spots on the beach to relax. 

Oh and I want to glamp up my campsite. :D 

So I'm just going to come up with ideas of what else I want to include on my island, figure out where my villagers can go permanently and go from there... :) I don't want to start over because I'm attached to my villagers, and I like my progress so far. I just need a lot of work lol."

Another person on my Facebook has been sharing this post around about hospitals being forced to list ALL deaths as COVID-19 deaths even if the patient hasn't tested positive. Like, is that true? If it is, I don't know how to feel about it. It would make actual fatality from the actual virus lower but I dunno...

I'm pretty sure tingly legs are symptoms once you've already got diabetes, like the neuropathy that happens is a cumulative effect of long-term diabetes. Totally not a doctor, but I am fairly certain that you would have other odd symptoms before leg issues. 

I would say if these symptoms last a long time (more than 2 weeks for example) or if they come with frequent urination, bad leg cramps, excessive thirst, etc, then I'd say reach out to your doctor if you have one.

For now, I'd just try to relax, especially during your period, and during this crazy-ass time in the world lol. Treat yourself to a break and watch a funny movie or something to take your mind off it.

I've found with my bad health anxiety, when I stopped thinking about things, the symptom would go away, only to come back when I started worrying again. Anxiety sucks that way.

AnimalCrossing,fnnmqvm,t1_fnnmoct,1587096075.0,Oh okay. So the x5 do they actually give you 5 times the miles when you complete them? I never noticed. Lol.
AnimalCrossing,fnnmmwt,t1_fnnmk85,1587095998.0,Hahah for sure
AnimalCrossing,fnnmmaz,t3_g2ubic,1587095987.0,How did you make enough nook miles?? I'm struggling with mine haha. Just have to do more challenges?
AnimalCrossing,fnnmge8,t1_fnnmdh3,1587095873.0,Haha. You know when you get like a muscle spasm thing? That. Plus under my thumb on my palm was really hurting too for a bit but it's better now.
AnimalCrossing,fnnmb61,t3_g2udbu,1587095771.0,Mine started twitching haha.
