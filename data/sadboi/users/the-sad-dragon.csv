He’d been arrested for rape before but told me all they did was hug and she was psycho and a compulsive liar and i believed him but now i realized how dumb i was to miss the signs :( I’ve thought about telling my therapist but it’s hard to admit out loud, thank you so much for taking time to read and help!"

AskReddit,fnq8j9t,t3_g31cur,1587159737.0,"When I was 15 I decided to go to this party (bad idea). And my ex boyfriend just happened to be there. My ex had raped me and physically abused me, so I of course avoided him at all costs. I was more stoned than I had ever been and before I knew it my ex had found me. He started making these jokes about my body. Pointing at the fridge and saying I was built like that. And then he proceeded to tell a group of people in detail about how I tried to kill myself when we were together. After laughing about it, he looked me dead in the eyes, and said “I regret nothing more than talking you out of doing it” then walked like nothing happened. I still think about this whenever I’m at a party."
