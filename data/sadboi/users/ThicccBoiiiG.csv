Spoilers obviously

  


Dave (lil dickys new show) by far has the best representation I've seen, so much that when you find out the one character is bi polar, you look back at his behavior and it all clicks immediately. But was done so in such a way that you wouldn't immediately think ""oh so he is supposed to have some mental health issues"".

  


It was so well done that I had to google to see if the dude was actually bi polar, which he was! He actually plays a dramatized version of himself on the show. So double points for representation.

The episode is kind of out of place because the show is pretty light hearted overall but they did a fucking amazing job. Totally unexpected for a comedy to nail it."
BipolarReddit,fox2tku,t3_g9yqvm,1588132735.0,"To me it doesn't particularly line up with Bi Polar mania/hypomania. But that's going off what little you've written. Outside of something like ADHD which literally shows up on an MRI, most diagnosis for anything are nebulous at best. Many share symptoms at a first glance, many personality disorders mimic them as well. Its a big tangled mess. All I can say is keep plugging away and working about it. Diagnosis in the end is just a way of saying you have a vague grouping of symptoms. What you individually feel and must tackle is always going to be exclusive to you.

Hell I've been at this for years and my most recent diagnosis was last October at the age of 33, for something that is patently blatant but was missed by multiple Psychs."

The terrible truth of it is. At 21 you're inevitably going to face a progressively more convoluted, challenging life. This truth is nearly universal. The scale and magnitude of hardships you will face will grow enormously. Its is kind of like lifting weights. This is an analogy- Right now 135 is crushing you on bench. In ten years, you'll be benching 405 and laughing at how you used to struggle with 135. Problem is, now you're getting crushed by something much heavier.

  


The fantastic truth of it is. At 21, with the exception of dying or life in prison, you basically can't fuck up your life. In fact you can achieve a shitload, fuck it all up a d lose everything, then do it a few more times over before doors start to close on you.

  


This is excellent news. You gotta remember that, because you are going to fuck your life up huge, like a few times.

  


  


Fact is, pushing through and surviving is kind of all you can really manage sometimes. And each time you'll be able to push through and survive things much worse. Trust me when I say you'll be shocked at just how much shit you can probably take.
