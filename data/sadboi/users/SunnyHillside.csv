I tend to over produce and then I'm sitting around for days/weeks waiting on my team to catch up. It's incredibly demoralizing to want to try to fix things and instead of fostering my skills and drive, they have killed it. I'm actually looking to quit this year and start my own company. My personality just won't survive with people that aren'taccountable. I look forward to other responses in hopes it helps us!"
ChronicPain,fqe8rst,t3_gibdb3,1589303600.0,Yup. Right before Covid... I decided to try again (for the 200th time) with a new doctor. He spent 15 minutes with me and spent about 5 of those on his phone. (I hadn't gone to the doctor in over a year because the last doctor essentially called me a drug addict. I went home and spent four hours looking up ways to commit suicide.). I left and could barely drive I was so upset and crying so hard. I wish doctors could understand how traumatic going to the doctor can be. Especially if you have seen doctor after doctor after doctor... I haven't pursued going back or trying to get help anymore mostly because of Covid. Sending you hugs. You are not alone.

Every military guy I've dated (5) has been an alcoholic. Some brainwashing has occurred and they have or desperately want kids. Maybe this has just been my luck. Vetting these men can he a challenge as they are trained to be under pressure and keep a good poker face. I ended up with a veteran and the road hasn't been easy. He's a full fledged alcoholic, has a child (I never wanted kids), hearing loss (blown up s few times),  nightmares, anxiety and a stubborn streak. But all the positives make it worth it. He is an extremely hard worker, giving, loving and is s true provider. Even though he is 100% disabled he works his but off every day. Its not always an easy road but he is worth it."

We have our issues (all relationships do) but we love each other and respect each other so I dont ever see cheating being an issue.

But i use a Dutch oven and leave the dough on parchment paper while cooking (less cleanup). The last two were actually pretty good. I put the dutch oven in my air fryer and turn it all the way up. Let it get real hot then I put the dough in and cook for 12-15 min. I have the instant omni air fryer. I can find very many air fryer recipes out there so I just play around with settings hoping eventually Ill figure it out."

dogs,fn7cr7m,t3_fzwis7,1586717766.0,"I had a strong girl that waited 3.5 days to come out. Here is what I did. I stopped feeding her but gave her plenty of water. I'd coo and talk softly to her. I put her in a place that was quiet and comfortable. I was fortunate to have a really neat set up for fosters after years of working on it. Everyday I made bacon and put a little outside her crate. She run out to get it (eventually) and run back in. Each day bacon got 2 feet further out. On day three, I looked down as I was singing to her, guess who was at my feet? It took every fiber of my being not to swoop down and hug and kiss her. Instead, I just continued cooing and didnt make eye contact. I dropped a piece of cooled bacon and she waged her tail. I melted. Throughout that day I slowly continued about my day, talking to her softly and moving as slow as possible. I never made eye contact or initiated touch. I dropped something and she ran to her crate. I was so mad at myself and thought I ruined all momentum. But the next day, i made bacon and she came right out to the kitchen. Each day was better and better. Around day 6, I finally got to pet and love on her. Fostering can be a VERY long process of rehabilitation. She was my longest case but not my hardest. You are an angel! Whatever you do, its the right thing because it feels right to you! Good luck!"

Even now, I cannot bring myself to make a doctor's appointment at all. For anything. I think  I'm just over doctors. Issue is I had to do blood work to refill my gabapentin and my liver levels are really low so they want me to come into the office. Im taking my fiance who is a Marine. I've given him full permission to go off on her if she says one single word about me ""faking"" or even alludes to it. Wish I could record it.

thebachelor,fce9beh,t1_fc0pons,1577618222.0,You are an angel for helping him. I fell down stairs in 2010 and I haven't been the same since. It rocked me physically and mentally. I struggle with pain almost every day. I had pretty much given up on finding a SO that would put up with my pain. Hell I can't even put up with it some days. But I met someone and he's my angel. I hope you are now married and living happily ever after!

I don't feel like I'm doing anything different so I'm trying to figure out if its temporary or if this is who he really is."
