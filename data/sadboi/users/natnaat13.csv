ptsd,fljm8do,t3_fp4mvx,1585218617.0,You are a hardworking a dedicated person. Instead of waiting for the government to send you a check you did what you needed to take care of yourself. Good job!( No shame to those who need assistance from the Gov) but it is important to exhaust all means until they are able to help. You are going to excell in life if you keep it up. You got this!!

Please get the help you need. Get away from him. Tell your parents you want to do virtual school or something. Tell them exactly what you are going through no matter how hard.

ptsd,fjmkazu,t3_fe7fcr,1583473133.0,"I have notticed that I now carry traits of my abuser. It is a constant battle controlling my mind and emotions. I highly suggest seeing a psychiatrist. It helped me a ton. I think you should talk about everything bothering you, but most importantly you need to talk about the feelings of wanting to touch others (I am assuming sexually). Listen i am not trying to be rude. 

You understand how it felt when your abuser touched you and did these verbally abusive things to you, right? 

You are doing amazing at taking steps to ask for advice here. And acknowledging the things you need help with is great. You must take action and get help so that you dont ""accidentally"" hurt someone because of bad thoughts. 

Trama changes your brain. It changes the way we develop and also causes hormonal change. It can greatly affect the way we think. talking to someone whom you do not know and is non biased is a great feeling. Getting it off your conscience is important. It's only 1 hour a week to see a counselor of some sort.  I wish you peace and the best in all that you do. Please consider taking my advice ‚ù§"

There is no peace when you survive this... unfortunately you just have to live with it. Fight everyday to see the great aspects of life and try not to think about it.

If the med card is up to date then it will be as if you passed the test. The employer will not know.

Lol This stigma about medical marijuana is so extremely ignorant. She also said ""you might as well just get prescriptions for opiates it's the same thing"" like what? That's what I'm avoiding doing. It's far from the same thing. I am avoiding getting addicted to opiates. And truly becoming drugged out off of truly bad medications.

When I went to check the schedule I saw his name on there. Asked some people who he was to make sure it was the same person...sure enough it was. Things got very scary at work so I had to quit to stay safe. I always wanted to be a detective. But after my abuse I have had such bad anxiety that I can't talk about a lot of the things detectives deal with daily. 

Sometimes our trama will take away parts of who we once were... unfortunately we have to stay strong and work through it. For me that was by choosing another career path.

All I'm asking for from him is 2 days a week to care for his son so I can study. He said he won't because he wants to pay off his car faster and save for a house. He does not give me money at all and like I said I am a SAHM and college student so I have no income. He does pay for food, etc to care for our family. But I need his help physically as well.
