He didn’t “single handedly create the $1,000,000,000,000 value” but with obvious foresight and organisation skills he might as well have. Without him that value wouldn’t exist. The apparent 1% proves this is a very difficult thing to do. We can’t say a manual labourer who works his hands to the bone every day deserves more money for example than Bezos because he “works harder”, it’s all about value to the consumer.

The market (more or less) determines what his workers are paid. If he pays his employees more, the end product costs more to the consumer.

I am subscribed to this subreddit because I’m interested in how to help the people at the bottom. I don’t think criticising and demonising successful people is helpful, I think it does the opposite. Like the title of this post has “Unemployment” and “Jeff Bezos” together. When Bezos employs a fuck load of people. It’s ridiculous."

On one side you have an apparent scientific consensus that we are causing accelerated warming (I wouldn’t question a bunch of neurosurgeons about something in their field etc). But what I can’t shake are the many inconsistencies in the claim. Such as:

- The historical graphs seem manipulated to look a certain way, and even where C02 seems to loosely correlate with temperature it actually lags behind temperature half the time. 
- it doesn’t make sense to me that minuscule differences of C02 in the atmosphere change the temperature. Like 0.0003% to 0.0004% 
- Science is supposed to be about discovering what’s true. Predicting the future is for fortune tellers.

There a probably ten other reasons but I’ll stop there. I kind of want to believe it’s true but going from logic and reason to blind belief is something I don’t think I can do."

auckland,fohw99d,t1_foerr9j,1587773864.0,"I don’t fully disagree with you. It makes some sense I just think it’s not going to work on a large scale. Apparently a very large percentage of criminals are sociopaths. Ie selfish, no empathy, manipulative etc. a study I looked at says: “Early life experiences or trauma, such as extreme poverty, abuse, rejection, and other adverse conditions can, if the biological nature allows, be part of the causes of sociopathy,”. So if a child is not nurtured and taught empathy, respect for others etc they just grow up to be an adult with no empathy, respect for others etc by default.
We agree that the parents are responsible for which way a child turns out but the question is what to do about it. I’m guessing the parents are usually sociopaths so they’re not going to do a great job at nurturing their children. Or go to the extreme of neglecting or even abusing them. What chance then does the child have for becoming a good person? (I would almost go as far as asking if their subsequent crimes are entirely their fault? I at least feel sorry for them in some cases in the general sense).
So if the cycle isn’t broken at home where is the only possible place they will learn empathy? The answer has to be early learning centres, primary school and secondary school also.

Also (fuck this is getting long) it kinda irks me when people commit horrible crimes, the public just gets out their pitchforks, call them pieces of shit etc and move on. Nothing changes. There are millions of future victims we should protect by at least TRYING to find root causes and fixing them.
