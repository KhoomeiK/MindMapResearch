She’s offered to give me her money in the past if I’ve been stressing about college and finding a way to pay for it. I remember being that age and any sort of money I received was a big deal to me. I think it’s sweet that she thought $20 would help me out a lot with college. Of course I didn’t take it, but I think of it sometimes. :) proud of you for getting treatment! Thank you!"
