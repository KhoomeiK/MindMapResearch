mentalhealth,fo60bkc,t1_fo2whz1,1587541772.0,"Sorry for the long post... I’m a long-winded person. Thanks for your reply.

I’ve posted in r/mentalhealth numerous times about it, but haven’t got any really good responses outside of seeking professional help. The whole situation behind my deteriorating mental health has been a combination of things going back a couple years, so it’s not just my grandfather. (One of the bigger things: a year ago I unexpectedly lost my mother. I found out through her life insurance company, and after calling her brother to verify - her brother and sister-in-law threatened me and my father’s lives. They divorced shortly before. After loosing my mom, my mentor was forced out of my university and I lost my job.)

My mental state has been a roller coaster... which makes me wonder if I have bipolar depression (which my mom had.) Things were improving in the fall, but ever since late December/early January, I’ve been in a depressive state where I’ve been constantly exhausted and my cognitive abilities have decreased.

At this point I have anxiety over my anxiety. I’m worried about how I’ll get (or even keep) a job with this. But recently, as you and others have pointed out, I’ve been really “lazy.” I feel like I’m constantly exhausted - it doesn’t matter how much or how little sleep I get, I feel constantly tired. My memory and cognitive abilities have noticeably gotten worse; things that I used to be able to do well (i.e. problem solving, writing) is now more difficult and I’m not as good at it. My focus isn’t as sharp.

I wouldn’t admit this to family/friends (this is kind of my throwaway account I use for talking about health issues), but I’m definitely in that “distraction” mode, where I play video games to not only take my mind off my real-world issues. But, as someone else mentioned, it’s also used to build a world where things are much better. An escape from the real world. I’ve been playing Minecraft for the past three years and I find it as a great distraction, but I fear the damage that such escapes can do.

By the way, I see a counselor weekly (at least for right now; it’s a grad student provided by my university.) But a couple years ago I lost my health insurance, so I can’t afford to see a real counselor or a psychiatrist. That also means I don’t have any access to the medication I used to take. My goal for the summer is to get a sliding pay scale setup so that I can find a more permanent solution that is in my budget (unfortunately I’ve been furloughed thanks to COVID-19.) 

I have another year of university left and then I really have to get my shit together so that I can get a job. As mentioned, my family is workaholics - so they’ll expect me to have a job lined up before I even graduate. Or it’s to McBurger Flipper I go. Which is another thing that stresses me out... I can’t work fast food/retail. But my family doesn’t care... they view a job as a job, and they don’t care if you like it or not - as long as you bring home a paycheck. But I have a completely different view... I believe people should find what they enjoy. I want a job that I enjoy and get fulfillment from.

I just try to tell myself that one day everything will work out and things will get better. I just need to take it one step at a time."
mentalhealth,fo2axge,t1_fnxabsb,1587455555.0,"I feel the same way. These last couple of years have been really difficult mentally, and thanks to not having any insurance I don’t have access to permanent/good treatment. I find myself doing things that I enjoy, which is to take my mind off reality and into a world where things are better than they actually are.

As for people thinking you’re lazy, I’ve had the same issue as the OP. My grandparents (and really my whole family) are die-hard workaholics. Ever since I was 13 years old (not old enough to even legally work) they commented on my “poor work ethic.” Ever since, things get tense when I don’t have a job (or a job they take seriously.) I’m already stressing out... last summer I took off for mental health reasons (my mom passed away last spring; I’m a college student) but I’m thinking about taking this summer off just to try to regroup again and get into a better mental spot. But I’m worried about how my family (who I will need to live with) will react.

Some days I feel like my mental health is destroying my life. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I’m not sure how I could function in a job with this... especially with my self-doubt, poor self-esteem and constant stress and worrying."
mentalhealth,fnd0h6s,t1_fncxm17,1586853878.0,"My university has three counseling departments for students. The first is the general counseling center, which is probably the best resource because they’re extremely helpful and ran by seasoned professionals. However, you can only be seen 3-4 times by one of their counselors before they refer you to someone else. The second is a clinic meant to help those out in the community, which is ran by grad students through my university. I used them for about a year and things were great until my original counselor found another job. My second counselor wasn’t as helpful (although still more helpful than my current counselor.) However, things started to pile up and they kicked me out of the program/referred me to other resources as IIRC the grad student felt she wasn’t the best help for me. The general counseling center is free, and the community clinic was extremely affordable (sliding pay scale.)

Then there’s where I’m at right now. There’s a third tier of counseling offered to certain students. While my counselor tries her best (and she is definitely better than nothing), it’s not nearly as good as the community clinic or the general counseling center. Both the general counseling center and community clinic are good about fostering a conversation, whereas my current counselor primarily listens and offers very little feedback. I sometimes feel like I’d have just as good luck talking to myself in a mirror. But she does have some good ideas and we have done some activities. But I still feel it’s not as good as it was with the community clinic or general counseling center. Another issue is that the counselor is leaving in May, so after May I’ll be back to square one. (Even if she wasn’t leaving, I’d have to find something for summer.)

I’m hoping to get something setup at least this summer that is more permanent. As mentioned, there’s a local clinic that offers both counseling and psychiatric services on a sliding pay scale. However, the counselors at this clinic are not as good as the ones at my university’s general counseling center or even the community clinic.

On the self-esteem: it’s difficult and I feel there are a lot of factors that play into that thought. A major stressor right now is finding an internship or job for this summer. Primarily because I have bills to pay (including medical bills) and other responsibilities... plus money for hobbies and other things. But me and my family - specifically my grandfather - have never seen eye-to-eye on jobs and work ethic. It’s always stressful being around family (especially my grandfather, but even my dad if he’s in a mood) when I don’t have a job. My grandfather has constantly berated my work ethic since I was 13 years old. Both of my grandparents (my grandmother passed away a couple years ago) always thought I was lazy, entitled and spoiled. My grandfather even told me that “I had everything handed to me” around the time I was 13/14. Truth is, I haven’t. I grew up in a low-income family and both parents disabled. Meanwhile, most of my other cousins grew up with parents who had good paying jobs and never had to worry about financials at such a young age. Me and my grandfather still butt heads, and I’m worried about this summer. Even when I have a job, my grandparents have attacked my work ethic. My grandparents both grew up on farms, so their definition of work is manual labor. I’m not cut out for physically-intensive/manual labor work. I’m guessing this is a major reason why I want to be truly independent/self-sufficient ASAP. Because until that day comes, my family will ridicule me for having a “terrible work ethic.” (Also should point out that my family doesn’t view mental health as a valid reason for taking time off.)

Another problem that I was thinking about the other day is I’ve never made any huge accomplishments... never won any big awards. An example that comes to mind is scholarships. In high school I worked hard writing scholarships essays and applying to as many as I could. Just to not receive a single cent. Meanwhile, even some of the kids who always slacked off and had no intentions of continuing their education got scholarships. I’ve also entered my work into numerous contests to always get “Honorable Mention” at best. It doesn’t matter how much time I dedicate to something or how proud I am of how it turned out, everyone else hates it.

I try not to let other’s opinions get to me, and I try to use their thoughts to improve. But it’s hard to avoid when getting a job is like a competition. The kids who got first, second, third place have a better chance than I do.

Then there’s not even knowing what I want to do with my life. I know I’m going to be forced into getting a job as soon as I graduate (see part about my family and my “poor work ethic”) so I really want to have a job that I thoroughly enjoy and is a good fit for me. I don’t want a job where I feel horrible, that isn’t a good match for me. But, as mentioned, my family views any job as a job. (They have the “go to work, clock in, do work, clock out, go home, rinse/repeat” mentality. They view a job/career as a paycheck, so finding enjoyment in it isn’t a priority.)

As mentioned, I feel the exhaustion prevents me from growing. I really haven’t been able to do the things I enjoy because I feel too tired or exhausted to do them. Which is frustrating...

Thanks for your reply and input."
mentalhealth,fhxkae1,t1_fhx5ead,1581956295.0,"I looked at it. Unfortunately, my state has actually been *rolling back* Medicaid coverage here. My state has clear requirements for any recipient of Medicaid: you must be blind, elderly (65+) or disabled in a way that impacts your ability to function normally. I’ve talked to some professionals about Medicaid and they’ve all told me that the chances of me getting accepted (using my depression/anxiety for the “depression” reasoning) is super slim."
mentalhealth,fhx5b5i,t1_fhx51rs,1581945082.0,"You’re not the first person to be surprised by that fact. Before going to an ER, a professor (who is new to our university) escorted me to the UHC. He was surprised to learn that this university doesn’t require domestic students to have insurance; only international students are required to have some form of health insurance here.

I’ve thought about applying for Medicaid in my state but I’ve decided against going down that route too far because it requires you to be blind, elderly (65+) or disabled to the point where you can no longer function normally (i.e. can’t hold a job.)

I looked at some plans under the ACA but they were *way* out of my price range. The cheapest option was like $400/month. I barely gross that."
mentalhealth,fhx4bsr,t1_fhx42m5,1581944105.0,"I no longer have health insurance. My counselor (not being a psychiatrist) isn’t able to prescribe medications, and the university health center is not exactly affordable. As mentioned in my post, I’m hoping to get something set up with a local clinic that has a sliding pay scale this spring to have a more permanent/better solution.

Before I was kicked off my insurance, I was taking a SSRI (Citalopram) for my anxiety/depression."
personalfinance,ff879h4,t3_es63cc,1579668006.0,"I’m going to start off by saying that I’m a full-time college student who is currently running into financial problems. I come from a low-income (<$20k/year) family, recently ran into some medical debt ($3k), need to purchase a new computer (another $1,500) and work two jobs. I thought I’d throw in my 2 cents.

1. A lot of people don’t understand that scholarships are hard to come by (especially ones that pay more) and sometimes it isn’t an option to work through college. In high school, I applied for many scholarships and despite having a good (although not the best) GPA, I didn’t get a single one. However, students with lower GPAs got tons of scholarships either because they were in a club (Student Council, FFA, etc.), a sport (baseball was the big one at our school) or worked/had parents who worked somewhere that offered scholarships. You can try to get scholarships but that doesn’t mean you’re going to get any.

As for work, I think a lot of (adults) don’t understand how things have changed. Students can only work 20 hours on-campus per law, and at least my university is *very* strict about that. (That’s $145 per week, if you’re paid the $7.25 Federal minimum wage.) You can get an off-campus job but I don’t have that ability for multiple reasons. 1) My schedule is already busy with classes, homework, a practicum, and my two on-campus jobs. Plus, I have other responsibilities like laundry, etc. 2) My college is situated in a rural community with very few jobs, unless you’re able to work manufacturing jobs. Other jobs, such as a retail and fast food, go almost quickly as they’re posted.

2. While I think $1k is too low for a car, you also don’t need a new car. I paid $1,700 for my current car and while its 20 years old (as old as myself), it has less than 150k miles and (knock on wood) has been pretty reliable. I know people who are driving 20-30 year old cars and they don’t have that many issues with them. My dad’s pickup is from 2003 and has nearly 200k miles on it, and its pretty reliable. It all depends, as you mentioned, how much you drive and stuff.

3. I agree. You can say I have poor work ethic, but I feel people should take time for themselves when needed and put themselves before their job. A “vacation” doesn’t have to be a trip to Hawaii or Mexico; it could be a couple days off work or a trip to the local lake to get away from it all.

4. Perhaps my biggest pet peeves is how people “devalue” (if that’s the word I’m looking for) higher education. I have nothing against trade schools and community colleges, but they’re not for everyone. I went to my 4-year university right out of high school (against my family’s wishes) and I don’t regret it - it gave me some amazing opportunities that I wouldn’t have experienced at a 2-year community college. Plus, I was worried about the logistics since I heard horror stories of classes not transferring from community colleges to the 4-year universities.

But 4-year universities are not for everyone. If you want to be a mechanic, go to a trade school. But if you want to be a doctor or engineer, your best bet is to go to a 4-year university."

I’ve looked at other health insurance options but they’re *way* out of my price range. The cheapest option was around $400/month, which is almost as much as I make each month. Even my school’s student insurance plan is around $2,000 per year (they don’t take monthly payments or anything.)"

We were under a tornado warning (although we weren’t under the threat, I was still terrified) and I can remember playing Super Mario World 2: Yoshi’s Island on the SNES to ease my mind.

I’d also recommend just being prepared. I know it may worsen the anxiety, but at least you’ll be ready to go in case things head south. Have a plan in place, and know where you’re going to go if a tornado warning is issued. Have emergency items - a flashlight, portable radio (if you have one), food, water, etc. - ready to go just in case.

Also know that you’ll probably make it through this. Knowing that the chance that the tornado was actually going to hit our house was super slim (like almost non-existent) helped quite a bit."
Anxiety,fdse1o3,t3_emnt46,1578700539.0,"First off, I’m sorry for your loss. A couple years ago we lost a Chihuahua (he was five) that I grew fairly close to after we adopted him. Lately I’ve been nervous about our 13 year-old pug, since we got her when I was 7 (I’m 20) and I know our time together is limited since the average lifespan of a pug is 12 years old. I remember the day we got her, too. My dad doesn’t want another pet and I couldn’t imagine life without having a pet (even if it doesn’t live with me) and I can’t adopt an emotional support animal because I don’t have access to mental health professionals who can write a note to my housing allowing me to have a pet.

After loosing the Chihuahua, I found the subreddit r/PetLoss. I was able to share my story and talk about memories with the pet and other people responded with me on ways to grieve. Perhaps you can share this on there?

I’d recommend trying to get another pet. I know many universities (such as mine) allow emotional support animals if you get a note from a doctor or mental health professional stating its for anxiety/mental health reasons. I know getting another pet won’t replace your old pet, but it’ll help make it easier and help with your anxiety.

Also, take some time to grieve. Perhaps talk to the ADA office at your university about the situation as they may help you take a couple days off because of anxiety/mental health? In April I lost my mother and it was a super traumatic experience, and I learned that sometimes time is the only way to get over the loss of a pet or loved one. Obviously a different circumstance, but I learned that having time to grieve and time to yourself is extremely important."

Please stay strong and realize you’re not alone. I know many people here in the United States who are terrified and anxious about what is to come and what may happen. I am myself, which brought me to this subreddit. Ever since the killing I’ve been extremely anxious, to the point where I keep refreshing the r/WorldNews subreddit to feed my anxiety. When I was a young teenager (about 6 or 7 years ago) I had become extremely anxious and depressed because I felt the world was coming to an end. With everything happening in the world today (Australian wildfire, Puerto Rico earthquake, and the Iran-US situation) that anxiety/depression that I haven’t experienced in years has come back. I’m scared that this is all going to spiral out of control and things are going to get really bad.

For me, it has been relieving and helpful to see that other people from all across the world are in the same situation. I know it sounds a little cold, but it’s helpful knowing I’m not alone.

I know it’s super hard (believe me), but try to do something - ANYTHING - to take your attention off the situation. I’ve been doing that lately and it helps a little bit, which is better than nothing. That can be playing video games, enjoying your hobbies, et cetera. Do things you enjoy doing.

I understand that many Iranian residents don’t have the financial resources to do this - BUT, if you can, I’d try to move to another country. Try to move somewhere more stable.

Please know that you’re far from alone, and please know that people care about you. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that you can find some peace.

medical,fawlzwm,t1_favjoyj,1576372921.0,"I had a blood test done a couple months ago and everything looked normal, including my A1C.

I did some research earlier and found that it *may* be caused by Sensory Processing Disorder. I have a couple of the symptoms (being uncoordinated, etc.) and I’ve had problems with my teeth and fingernails/toenails being sensitive my entire life - even as a young kid. (However, unlike the WebMD page says, I was never a fussy baby with behavioral problems. But I do have anxiety.) While my fingernails used to bother me when trimming them, I don’t have that problem anymore. Usually I can cut them without any problem.

I’m also starting to begin to think that this toenail may be ingrown. It seems like most of the pain is coming from the left side of the (right big) toe where the toenail meets the skin. The pain intensifies anytime there is pressure applied on the toe.

I have not tried topical cream, and have also not tried going to a salon or getting a pedicure. I’ve always had a problem with other people cutting my toenails due to the pain.

Thanks for your reply."

I’ve noticed that from time to time I will get disoriented and dizzy or my entire body will go numb, although just for a couple seconds while the numbness in my arm/hands persists. I am taking a multivitamin - but no other medication. I once went to the hospital before for something similar in one of my arms, although that was caused by me sleeping on my arm. I’m otherwise healthy and not sick. I don’t eat vegetables or fruits, I mostly eat meat. I do a lot of walking and bicycling, trying to get some exercise in daily. There hasn’t been a rise in my body temperature. I haven’t had any headaches lately, although I used to get migraines pretty regularly.

I have anxiety/depression but have not been taking the medication for it since I lost my insurance a couple years ago, as I can’t afford it or to see a psychiatrist. But that’s been a couple years, and I haven’t really had any problems until now.

findapath,f3otmfh,t1_f3ccqe8,1571028269.0,"Biggest problems with internships is the financial issues it brings up. I was offered an internship this spring for the summer but didn’t take it because I’d have to drive around 100-120 miles round trip every day in a city. (I attend a rural university, so there isn’t many internship opportunities in the area. And the ones that do rarely pop up are almost always unpaid.) That internship was offering a stipend and even called me back and upped the stipend, but it still wasn’t enough and then my mom passed away and that tied the deal. I also HATE driving - especially in big cities. Just going to the interview was nerve-racking.

I understand a lot of people in journalism don’t end up going into journalism, but rather PR, video work, etc. But I also have to finish the program - and if I’m getting burned out or having difficulties finishing my present major, it’s probably best to change to something less stressful and perhaps more closely with something I can see me doing for the rest of my life.

There’s a few reasons I say I’m burned out in journalism. Before the train wreck of events occurred (mom passing, mentor moving, losing my job, etc.) I was starting to get stressed out. The thought of an internship and having to write about things I may not necessarily want to write about caused me to start to rethink my major. I also was thinking about the low pay and odd hours, as well. Even before everything started I started questioning whether this is what I truly wanted to do. But after everything happened, I think that really exacerbated everything.

This year, as mentioned, I don’t want to do anything journalism. It’s hard to even built up enough motivation to start working on a project for class, let alone anything outside of class. Which is upsetting because I’ll look back at my work from last year and just think “I can’t do this anymore.”

I also understand burnout is something that affects a lot of journalists. Depending on where they work and what they cover, it can be almost non-stop. My mentor was a journalist who got “burned out” and went into teaching it, and another mentor who I worked under in an informal internship in high school stopped doing journalism and is now doing design for a magazine IIRC.

I’m just going through this dark time in my life where I have no idea what I want to do or anything. All of the things I used to be interest me no longer interest me, or at least not to the same degree. All of the things I wanted to do I no longer want to do. The things that I used to be sure of I’m no longer sure of. In addition to that, I’m trying to pick myself up financially in addition to emotionally/mentally and academically."
findapath,f3ahm1r,t1_f38b7kh,1570773592.0,"Sorry for the delayed response. First, I believe we chatted a little while ago on another topic in this subreddit. I’ve been thinking about changing to web design for about a month now, as I used to love it. I just get concerned that it may not be for me because I’m not the most creative person on the planet, nor can I do computer drawings in programs like Adobe Illustrator. And I’m definitely not a computer science type - I could barely pass a College Algebra course I had to take - there’s no way I’m getting near calculus.

Also, as mentioned, my university discontinued their web design program. So essentially me and a person in that department (that used to teach it) are putting together a custom/individualized major. Unfortunately, our school eliminated some of the needed classes - while others are offered at very odd times. I’m looking at possibly postponing my graduation by a semester or two.

I’ve been thinking about possibly studying abroad. So maybe (if I do that) I can pick up some of those classes at another institution. But I’ve been in a financial rut anyways (been unemployed for a few months, though I recently finally found a job) and my computer is starting to get outdated and it’s time to start budgeting for it’s replacement - which isn’t going to be cheap (~$1,300.) So study abroad may/may not happen. Recently I’ve been thinking more and more about moving out of the United States at some point after graduation, even if it takes a few years.

The things I like about web design is the flexibility. I can move around and some positions may let you work from home. (Although I’d prefer an in-person job - even though I’m tech-savvy I still prefer face-to-face communication.) I also like how I can become entrepreneurial with it - after growing my portfolio, I can start my own firm.

To me, low stress levels and being able to live comfortable (being self-reliant) is very important. I’ve lived in a (really) low-income family my whole life and want to break that cycle.

I already know basic HTML/CSS and *very* basic PHP. (It’s been a while since I’ve designed a website, so I’m a little rusty - especially at the PHP.) I’ve always wanted to learn more advanced HTML/CSS tricks (especially HTML5), definitely learn responsive web design and SEO, and learn more sophisticated languages like PHP, Java, jQuery, MySQL, etc. I used to own my own freelance website design firm back in high school and eventually did a couple websites for a local non-profit, as well as mock sites, my own firm’s website, etc. I taught myself HTML and CSS - eventually going from table-based websites (that’s so ‘90s) to div-based sites. None of those sites were responsive or very mobile-friendly, which is a huge problem in this mobile-dominated world.

Thanks for your response. Sorry for the lengthy reply."
findapath,f36anbe,t1_f36aewm,1570709450.0,Oops... my bad. I’m adding them to the original post. Thanks.
findapath,f183vnv,t1_f15re25,1569252296.0,"Thanks for your reply. As I mentioned, I did freelance website design in high school and enjoyed doing it. While it didn’t pay much (then again I lived in a fairly small town where web design wasn’t really in demand and most small businesses were willing to settle with Wix/Weebly sites) I did make a little bit of money off of it. I only knew basic HTML/CSS. I’ve been doing web design since I was in elementary school (designing my first personal websites using GeoCities then Weebly) before teaching myself basic HTML/CSS in middle school.

The most recent project I did was for a local event. That project was a huge failure... halfway through the project I was about to give up. The client wanted a lot of bells and whistles that required a lot of JavaScript and more advanced languages that I had absolutely no experience in. My goal is to be able to learn those more sophisticated languages or find a way where I can bring those features to future clients.

Right now my biggest goal is to get out and find a job where I can be successful in a career, be able to pay off my student debt and live comfortably. My endgame goal is to open my own web design firm, like what I had back in high school. But obviously more successful and having the ability to live off of that.

I think one thing that helps in my case is that I’ve learned a lot of video and photography work in my current major. I’m already proficient and experienced in Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, so page layout and basic graphic design are things I can do. I’ve also learned video editing with Adobe Premiere. I’m actually currently taking video and audio courses. I feel that being well-rounded in those fields will allow me to do more than web design in the end.

In the short term, I honestly feel I’m making the right choice. I spoke to professional journalists here on Reddit (in fact, they were the ones who referred me to this subreddit) and they suggested that journalism is grueling, mentally-taxing work that doesn’t pay well. I’m just a junior in college and I’m going through a burnout in journalism. Just thinking about changing my path and doing something else I enjoy has made a huge improvement in my overall mood. I no longer feel doomed."
findapath,f15leyl,t1_f157ze9,1569192226.0,"Chris, it’s interesting to see your post.

I’m a junior at a four-year university and have already changed my major once. (First computer networking and now digital journalism.) I used to be super passionate about journalism, but lately that passion has waned and its taken a toll on my mental health. There were a lot of personal issues that lead up to it (loosing my mom, major changes in our department, my mentor leaving and loosing my job.)

Lately, I’ve thought about pursuing web design/development as a career. Back in high school I was really into web design (I started my own freelance web design business, although it was fairly short-lived) and always wanted to learn more about it and further myself. Back in high school I tried to teach myself PHP using CodeAcademy, but got half-way through the course and couldn’t progress no matter what.

My university, however, doesn’t offer a web design/development program anymore. But I’m currently looking at creating a custom major that will allow me to learn web development and get my bachelors.

Do you have any suggestions on how to succeed in web design? What practices and coding languages to learn? Is it enough to live on, even starting out? What is the stress level like in web design?

I’m just super worried that I may not learn everything I need to in order to succeed (it’s an individualized/custom major,) and if this is the right choice for me. It’s scary trying to pick a major, as you’ll be doing that for the rest of your life.

Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Journalism,f0p69w5,t1_f0o0zht,1568828096.0,"First, I’ve been getting help. There has been a slight change in my help, but recently it’s been too much. Each session I’d have too much to talk about to fit into the hour.

I’ve done research and have heard over the years that burnout is a serious problem with journalists. I also understand people change, situations change and things that a person used to be passionate about may no longer interest them. I believe I’m at that point. Especially loosing my mentor who inspired me and loosing my job. Plus, as mentioned, my current professor and the new adviser of our student newspaper are both hard to get along with and leave condescending remarks that really discourage me every time I read them.

I took your advice and asked myself “do I want to do this every day for the rest of my life?” I don’t think so. In addition to the burn out, deadlines are super stressful and the more I think about it, the less I think I’m cut out for this. As I told a friend today: journalism in high school and college is easy, but it gets really hard out in the real world when you have those crazy hours but have bills and responsibilities to take care of.

I’ve also seen a lot of people get their degree and work a dead-end job at their local fast food restaurant or supermarket. I don’t really want to be one of them. I’m definitely not cut out to do something like fast food for the rest of my life. (I worked in fast food in high school and couldn’t handle it between the management and people.) Finances is a big stressor in my life - I grew up in a household where both of my parents were disabled and unable to work. I want to be able to make it after I get out of here - be able to live comfortably while being able to pay back my student debt.

I guess another thing that plays into all of this is that I already changed my major once. I’m in my junior year. But I don’t think I can do this every day for the rest of my life. I’d rather change my major and get a degree that I can use to get a job that I enjoy rather than stay on my current path, get burned out and be flipping burgers for the rest of my life. I also get stressed out just thinking about how much student loans I’m accruing even as I write this reply.

I’ve thought about it and think I’m going to end up changing my major. I used to really love designing websites, so perhaps that’s what I should do? I’ll have to talk to people at my university and see what options are out there and go from there.

Thanks for your reply. It’s greatly appreciated.

It also helps having friends and former coworkers who understand. One person I’ve been talking to lately was a former friend/coworker of mine who changed their major from journalism due to be burned out, as well."

I'll have to look into the peer support group, but I don't believe there is any on campus. (But I might be wrong.)"
MentalHealthSupport,ez5bu81,t1_ez3fze7,1567697827.0,"Thanks for your reply. My therapist was through the graduate psychology department on our campus. We talked about health insurance options. Last year, my school offered an affordable health insurance plan for students (it could also be billed to your student account) but from what I've heard, they ditched it this year in favor of a plan where students have to pay $3,000 out of pocket to get coverage. (In other words, way too expensive - and it can't be billed to your student account.)

As far as my father's insurance (Medicaid): the limit is 19. When a dependent/child hits 19 years old, they're officially on their own and ineligible for health insurance unless they reapply on their own. I've talked to people about applying on my own (as an independent) but I've heard too many excuses about why I'll be declined.

I've also looked elsewhere for health insurance. When my mom was alive she encouraged me to look. The cheapest plan I found for me was like $400/month. I didn't even make that in a month when I worked...

As mentioned, the psychiatrist/counselor I saw before loosing my insurance has a sliding pay-scale. But being unemployed (they require your recent pay-stubs) I don't think they can help me at all.

Thankfully, my university has a counseling center (outside of the grad department - this one is staffed by seasoned professionals who have had their degree for some time.) I've used that counseling center a couple times (like between loosing my insurance and getting connected with the grad department) and they are really good, but they will also only see you three times before referring you out due to the volume of students trying to make appointments and the limited professionals they have. (They only have three or four professionals IIRC, and we have just under 15,000 students on this campus.)"

I've learned that I have good days and bad days. I have some days where I'm really productive on stuff I need to be, and there are also those days where I have a depression/anxiety episode and all I want to do is play video games and watch stuff. Despite all the anxiety/depression this semester, I've really tried to make sure that I at least do my homework... except that one class from the summer. That one is really stressing me out, as it did over the summer. And I haven't even starting doing anything with it."
