I think I will make more of an effort to temp and CM every day then otherwise there's probably no point in doing anything. 

With the early ov - I used to get positive estrogen at cycle day 6, and I do think it's got to do with the short cycle. I went to the GP a couple months ago and that's why they did the ultrasound. I figure if things are still like this once corona situation relaxes a bit il go to the drs to follow up.

My periods are normal (they weren't in the beginning I had period pain most of the month and severe during) and I do also get notable ovu pain and fertile CM around the same time every month early in my cycle, but I think iv only ever ovulated once, where the shift was really high.

I have a short cycle, usually 21 days, and I think iv only ovulated once in the past 6 months (took implant out in Oct). FF gave me crosshairs dotted for cd8, but it's since taken it away. But my charts never really looked like this before where I can visibly see that shift in temp so what else am I missing? Is there just not enough accurate data? Not enough of a shift? 

Btw ..that gap around my period was when I decided not to test my temp too cos I couldn't even get it at the same times, but I later changed my mind.
