BPDlovedones,fr0gohy,t3_gkfr4a,1589795003.0,"I'm having this issue with my gf. I've noticed just about every time we make plans ahead of time to hang out, even if it's just getting some snacky food and watching movies, she'll either blow it off or find a way to sabotage it by starting an argument over something completely inconsequential.

Tonight it was over cheese dip. We'd planned to get some frozen pizzas, chips, and dip and spend some time watching a show tonight. I get back from the store after finding the last bag of the kind of chips we wanted and the last queso dip with jalapenos. I'm all excited and happy to tell her I got the right stuff, and this is how the conversation went:

""Why'd you get jalapeno dip?""

""?? We've gotten spicy queso before...""

""I've never gotten queso with jalapeno dip!""

It then spirals into a circular argument of her FOR SOME REASON trying to tell me that other spicy dips with various peppers in them don't count, that if she'd found the dip herself it would have been a ""special moment"" for her because she likes it, the whole time I'm just trying to tell her this doesn't need to be an argument and if she wants me to go get something different I will, then she says that's not what she's saying, throws it back on me and accuses me of yelling at her even though I'm not, I'm exasperated at that point, and it ends with her declaring ""We're done"" and asking me to get away from her bedroom door before she shuts it on me. 

This is not even close to the first time she's sabotaged what should have been nice plans. But if we decide to do something spontaneously, it's usually fine. I just...why?"
BPDlovedones,fr0fhoo,t1_fqr2aot,1589793762.0,"Had a former friend/roommate do that to me. Me and my ex moved in with her and her bf/later husband after falling on hard times. She'd admitted in high school that she had a crush on me but I had made it clear I didn't feel the same. Things started off great. We worked well together, the four of us would clean house together at least once a week, we all had plans to get jobs and save to move out of state, ect. Things started getting weird after a few months but I was already in such a fragile state mentally my mind couldn't handle or recognize what was going on.

* She'd do things like flash her chest and claim it was because she'd gotten too high on weed.
* She'd get overly affectionate with me, then get upset that her husband was at work (she eventually started ignoring/devaluing husband).
* Would refer to me as her ""pet lesbian""
* Would do things to intentionally stress the hell out of my ex if they were home alone behind my back (I still kick myself for not catching on to that).
* Sabotaged her jobs every time we'd get to a point where we could save money.
* Became verbally and emotionally abusive toward her husband.
* Cheated on her husband and vehemently denied it even though she wasn't making any real effort to hide it.
* Started stealing mine and my current gf's portion of the wifi money, then would blame my gf for the internet getting throttled because she works online.

I had told her a few months prior to my move out date that I was planning to move the same month they were going to have a major apartment inspection. I wasn't on the lease and didn't want to risk them getting kicked out from me being there. After piecing together her manipulative, sabotaging ways, I decided it would be safer if I didn't tell her exactly when I'd found a place. I knew she would find a way to fuck it up. So me, my gf, and my best friend moved all my shit out in one night while she sent her husband out in the living room to angrily monitor us while she hid in her bedroom and wouldn't come out. Found out a couple months later from a former mutual friend that she started a smear campaign against me claiming I just up and moved with no warning, when I'd moved during the month I said I was going to.

I figure she didn't take it seriously because she knew she'd be able to keep me there if she had enough prep time and got mad when I didn't give her the opportunity. She popped back up in my dead tumblr inbox last month insulting my physical appearance and trying to shame me for ""losing so many friends"" because I didn't understand that ""all (gf) wants is to abuse you"" (gf is most likely BPD too but that's another can of worms). These ""friends"" she's referring to are our diagnosed BPD neighbor that kept me around in between her dysfunctional relationships because she knew I was crushing on her and smeared me as soon as I got a gf, and roommate's emotionally and mentally fried husband that she treated like absolute shit. So basically she's shaming me for ditching a group of abusers and enablers."

Worst date: Went to a hookah lounge with very unstable ex, her friend, and some people we'd met throughout the week. Turns out ex was WAY more controlling than I realized. Girl that was hanging with us wanted to go to a bar. Ex didn't and was becoming increasingly manic. Girl ended up being an alcoholic and a recovering heroine addict, so she was somehow trashed by the time we walked from the hookah lounge to the bar to find her and meet up with the other friend that followed her. Ex gets upset and goes running down the street. We end up at drunk girl's apartment where she spills everything that had happened over the past few months, including her gf dying of an overdose. I'd like to point out here that this is literally the most we've interacted with this girl since we met her. A bunch of random people show up with at least one kid and we eventually leave.

My girlfriend helped me uncover the wool I'd been keeping over my eyes because I'd been in survival mode for most of my life up to that point and was too mentally broken to deal with reality. 

""Friend"" had been sabotaging me and her bf/husband financially the entire time I lived there. We'd talked about pooling our money together and moving out of state, but every time we'd start to get a handle on things and save money, she'd quit her job or find some way to lose it. Or she'd convince her husband to quit his citing his multitude of health issues related to a bad accident he had a few years prior. Since I wasn't on the lease, I couldn't even save up enough to get my own place since I'd have to pay extra to keep a roof over everybody's head. I was the only one with an income for about a month and a half, and neither of them seriously started looking for work until I had a full breakdown. Literally all they did was sit around watching shows and playing video games. Their house was constantly filthy.

When my girlfriend moved in, they started stealing from us. Ex-friend stopped paying the WiFi bill even though we paid more than half of it, but would lie and say they did, then blame my girlfriend when the internet would get throttled (gf works online so friend was trying to mess with her income). Husband stole girlfriend's juul and ended up putting it back in a place we never would have put it. Weed would go missing even though we'd give husband some any time he asked and would leave some in his piece if we used it. Friend stole a mask girlfriend got me for Christmas and it never turned back up. 

They also neglected the fuck out of their animals. They had two dogs and two rats. The dogs weren't given enough food so they were food aggressive and the bigger one was an uncontrollable food thief. The carpet in their bedroom had to be ripped up and deep cleaned because of the animal piss and shit since they rarely, if ever, let them outside. The rats were even worse. She eventually got bored of them, and didn't want to put in the effort to socialize the feeder rat she'd stupidly bought, so she eventually stopped feeding them. When I left, they were confined to an empty cage 24/7 and were lucky if they got watered or fed at all. They fought constantly and were stressed and miserable.

I moved without telling her because we'd told them three months earlier that we were planning to move by a specific month, and we knew she would sabotage us if she found out we'd found a place. Found out a few months later they got busted by the IRS for lying about their income in a government assisted apartment and got kicked out. Good riddance."

I think she has a crush on me too from the way she opens up around me, and I've picked up on her subtly flirting with me on multiple occasions.

The problem? She has a fiance and is in a monogamous relationship (my girlfriend and I are very open). I fucking hate her fiance and so do our other two guy friends. He's the type of person that you just have to take one look at and you instantly get a really nasty vibe from him. I kept checking myself because I knew my perspective would be biased. ""Maybe I'm just being jealous. Maybe I'm looking for reasons to dislike him. Maybe I'm exaggerating his flaws."" No. His behavior backs up the vibe. He's extremely inconsiderate of her boundaries. I've noticed him sneakily trying to be inappropriate with her at work and then denying it when she gets angry at him. The way he talks to her when he thinks no one is listening is fucking gross. He puts her down constantly, but does so in a playful enough way that most people wouldn't catch it unless you know what to look for. He comes across as very insecure and possessive. She'd worked there about two years prior to me, and they've known each other since high school. It took her a while to come out of her shell and start talking to people. I thought it was because she was really introverted and shy, but now I know where it comes from. Shortly after she started opening up and socializing more at work, he got a job there and transferred to her department as soon as he had the chance. He popped the question to her shortly after that. The timing seems really red-flaggy.

She had been showing signs of declining health for a while. One day my mom called me and said she'd been hiding under the bed, wouldn't eat, and wasn't breathing normally. I immediately started crying, told my second job I wouldn't be coming in, and went to my parents' house to get her. When I went to pull her out from under the bed as gently as possible, she meowed in pain. As soon as she realized who I was, she relaxed into my arms and it seemed like we both knew what was about to happen.

She rode in my lap wrapped in a towel the entire 40 minutes to the vet while my now ex-girlfriend drove. Brought her into the vet in tears and told them what was going on. They took her to the back to put her on oxygen and stabilize her, and all I kept saying was I needed to be near her because I didn't want her to be scared. They brought her into the room I was in and gave everyone a few minutes to say goodbye. The vet was already choking back tears when she came in. She asked me how long I'd had her, and she broke down when I told her. 

My cat wasn't afraid at all. She was calm and kept raising her head to lick my face and comfort me. It sounded like she was trying to purr despite not being able to breathe. She was a wise cat and was letting me know she would be okay. I kept my forehead against hers until I felt her leave, then I couldn't stand anymore and dropped to my knees sobbing. She lived a full, happy life, but it was still one of the hardest experiences to help her pass on."

AskReddit,fecryoc,t3_eodtd1,1578982346.0,"My last roommates actively prevented improving their situation for at least five or more years.

I moved in with them in 2016. The woman was an old high school friend, the guy is her high school sweetheart and they married while I lived there. I had found myself in a bad spot and they offered the spare room in their apartment. My ex and I only planned to stay for a few months while we got back on our feet. 

Turns out I had dramatically underestimated my now former friend's mental issues. She's most likely BPD, is fully aware, and has absolutely no desire to address it. She spent the entire time I lived there lying, manipulating, sabotaging us and herself (she quit multiple jobs because she 'couldn't handle' them, but she always did it as soon as one or more of us had started being able to save money), you couldn't talk to her about any of it without her having a complete mental breakdown, she's emotionally abusive toward her husband which lead to her cheating on him and barely trying to hide it, ect. The final straw was when my current girlfriend and I caught them stealing from us. My girlfriend's income is online, so the woman roommate started using our wifi money for other things, and then lying to us and claiming it had been paid. We found proof three months in a row but had to play it safe because we knew she would ramp up her shit to make sure only my girlfriend would leave and I'd be stuck. 

Wrapping things up here before this gets too long. A couple of months after we moved out, I found out they were busted by the IRS for lying about their income in a government-funded apartment and got kicked out. I'm not sure where they ended up, but I know they most likely had to give up the two dogs and two rats they had been neglecting horribly, and they would have either had to move into the guy's parents' house (woman's personal hell) or move into a much more expensive complex. They got karma-nuked."

AskReddit,fdumpms,t3_eauhhu,1578735409.0,"I'm three years away from being 30 and I'm only just now in a safe enough environment to begin to dig deep into the multiple layers of mental issues I've picked up over the years. I feel like I should be so much farther along in myself than I am.

My family will never admit to anything, or take responsibility for the fucked up shit they believe and do to each other. My parents married because my mom got pregnant with me, and my dad's family is Catholic, so it was mostly an obligation. He resented the absolute fuck out of me and made it clear. I remember being confused a lot as a little child. He'd go from playing with me and being friendly, to suddenly getting irrationally angry for a small thing I'd done wrong, or for reasons I never understood because they were never explained. My mom wasn't as violent, but there was never any doubt in my mind who had priority in her life; my dad. She was at his beck and call constantly. Granted, he was an abusive piece of shit to her too, but when a child/later children are involved and you choose to not even try to get out of that environment, you've already fucked up in my book. 

Sperm donor was mentally, emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. I could write a book on all the crazy shit he did while I was growing up. I left home at 19 at the first chance I got and ended up living with a covert narcissist, which effectively shattered my naive ideas of having freedom and happiness after getting out of my parents' house. During that time, me and the narc ended up living with a slew of absolutely horrible roommates (another manipulative narcissist that abused vyvance and her dog, a girl that was in cahoots with the 'subletter' that scammed us, a dysfunctional couple that consisted of an individual who was addicted to speed-based diet pills and a woman with severe mental health problems exacerbated by her non-existent med schedule, and the ex of the narc who is a psychopathic disgraced college professor with a criminal record that includes but is not limited to multiple shoplifting charges, stalking, and at least one sexual harassment charge from one of his students).

I ended up homeless for about a week, moved in with my aunt for about six months, and had to move back home for a while. My dad almost immediately started threatening me with rent, even though I had a solid full-time job within two months of living there and was saving up money to get a car with no help from the family, despite the fact that my grandad had helped my brother get his first car. My brother still lives under their roof, with his (I assume) now ex-girlfriend that recently cheated on him. He doesn't pay rent, has never been threatened with rent, and neither does the girl. I recently began putting the pieces together with the help of the woman living with me now that my entire family knew about the abuse to some degree. They either chose not to believe me, chose to protect him regardless, or chose to not do anything. As of Christmas of 2018, I finally had enough when my grandmother had the spine to openly direct their bigotry in my direction. Before that, they'd been icing me out of the family for several years.

Long story short (haven't even gotten into the last roommates I had, which consisted of a close friend from high school and her now husband that I discovered had been lying, stealing, and sabotaging me so I couldn't leave), my life up to this point has been gaslighting, manipulating, abuse, apathy, fake friendships, ect. It's shattered me as a person. I used to be so open and empathetic to people. I never wanted anyone to feel the pain I did, so I made myself far too open to the wrong kinds of people. Now I don't trust my own thoughts. I don't trust my judge of character. I'm constantly trying to figure out what people are wanting to use me for. I keep everyone at a distance. I'm terrified of intimacy when I used to crave it. I see aspects of both my parents in me and it makes me sick on every level.

I fight every day to rebuild and redevelop myself into someone I can be proud of. Me. Nobody else. Breaking the codependency has been one of the hardest parts, along with working to change my perspective of people and the world in general to something more productive. It's like taking everything you are, setting it on fire, and waking up in a pile of your own ashes over and over again..but at least now I'm the one setting the fire."

I was underage and didn't go in, but from what I was told by the two guys that we're with us, she got shitfaced faster than I've ever witnessed and was dancing on tables in the bar.

AskReddit,fbzx3fv,t3_ef0f59,1577266355.0,"That increasing the minimum wage to keep up with production and inflation will somehow cause more inflation. First of all, the only reason inflation tends to follow a minimum wage increase is because there is nothing stopping major companies from jacking up their prices to keep the same short-term profit margin, thereby perpetuating the problem. If they would pay people more without increasing their prices to cancel out the raise, they would see bigger profits in the long run since people would be able to afford to buy things. The busiest times of the year at my work have been slower than I ever thought possible, and I have to wonder if a major factor is people's steadily decreasing spending power.

Second, and this one drives me up the wall even worse, is the belief that the minimum wage is only meant for teenagers looking for spending money. It's not. It's a well documented fact that the minimum wage was insistuted as the minimum amount someone would need to earn to afford basic living expenses. Housing, food, transportation, utilities, childcare, basically anything that has become an absolute necessity in order to function at the bare minimum level in society. Without it, companies would pay their employees as little as they could get away with."

What you just said is something genuinely shit men tell themselves so they don't have to face the fact that they can't get a girlfriend because they have a manipulative, horrible personality and use that to self-sabotage so they can perpetuate their misery. Women are guilty of the same thing. I lived with a married couple for three years that were the poster children for how to actively perpetuate their own misery and they made sure to spread it to everyone around them. I got dragged down with them for a long time before someone very dear to me smacked me with reality and woke me up. By then I'd let myself spiral into such a dark, toxic, debilitating mindset that it took almost a full year before I got back to a functional point and wasn't miserable constantly. 

Don't believe everything people say. Pain can change the way your mind processes reality. It can make you paranoid and give you extremely narrow-minded views of the world. Blame everything and everyone else so you don't have to look at yourself in the mirror and realize you're the one with issues you need to work on. You could have so many experiences that will help you grow and develop as a person, but you're already self-sabotaging and making sure that won't happen by listening to self-loathing grown ass sadboys on the internet.
