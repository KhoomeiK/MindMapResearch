stepparents,epvzpsy,t1_epvj6f4,1559560065.0,"I agree. 

OP you sound like a wonderful person and it makes me so happy to hear that you help keep her other mommy alive by keeping pictures in the house and not making her a taboo topic. Your husband probably always imagined his daughter to call his late wife mommy but never expected her to die during childbirth. I’m guessing hearing that has brought up some grief that he never had to deal with before. Counseling sounds like a fantastic idea, maybe for the daughter too because she will need to understand why her dad is behaving this way. She probably has no idea why he is behaving the way he is. 

OP, keep doing what you’re doing. You’re doing great! It sounds like they both love you very much."
