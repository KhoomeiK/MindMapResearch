femalefashionadvice,fgmrm4o,t1_fgllq1f,1580930639.0,"There are recent studies that suggest that the percentage of diagnosed people in a relationship is higher than previously thought. Although, some of the studies don't have a large amount of participants. I've seen figures that indicate that closer to 9% are married. There's a lot of research being done about the percentage of autistic people that identify as LGBTQ+ so in my opinion, it's worth considering the percentage of people that cannot be married in their country. Although that's more of a personal theory of mine. It can also be very difficult and costly to receive a diagnosis which can skew the numbers in these studies. Self-diagnosis is controversial. ( Personally, I am not self-diagnosised, but do support others that do. ) I agree that relationships with ASD can be very difficult. Realtionship between neurotypicals can also be very difficult.
