sewing,folduw7,t3_g83puk,1587860123.0,"Fabric is two colors of the 1964 Puketti pattern by Marimekko in 100% cotton. Didn‚Äôt use any patterns, just did the measurements myself! The blue sunglass case was a little small for glasses bigger than my own so that‚Äôs why the red one is slightly bigger! Each project took about a half hour minus breaks because I‚Äôm a sewing novice and was trying to be slow and careful. 

The faster I was able to go, the better the lines looked? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because the slower I was going the more pulling of the fabric I was doing.

Nevertheless very excited to keep on with it!"

POTS,fjt03oe,t1_fjsypg7,1583602044.0,"I‚Äôve never been a big partier/drinker anyway, haha. The most people I‚Äôll hang out with at once is maybe 3-4 people and I‚Äôll maybe have two drinks tops. Really close friends and laughs are good distractions for me. Drinking too much also makes me tachycardic so I much prefer weed for a buzz (CBD dominant/indica strains for sure, sativa puts me through the roof with panic). As for my panic attacks, they‚Äôre pretty indiscriminate. Sometimes they happen because of the tachycardia and other times they happen because of bad nausea or brain fog (bright lights are also a major trigger for my symptoms too oddly enough, grocery stores are my personal hell üò≠). Some of my panic attacks make me flare up a lot worse and I can be in bed for a day or so."

When you start job searching, you may be able to find places that need desk-type positions filled depending on where you are. They don‚Äôt have to be big companies, could be local business too (might be a little more complicated to contact/apply to these, but it‚Äôs worth a look). Could be information handling or anything like that where you‚Äôre not running around on your feet like crazy all day. 
Maybe somewhere like an antique store or local book store! The quirky environment might make you feel comfortable and happy while you work.
