That’s like question how a teenager is atheist when their parents are hardcore Christians. Because you know people can choose who they are and what feels good to them; they shouldn’t be forced to anything. 


I was never religious and didn’t believe in a god at all until I became a teen and started doing some research and in turn found a religion I felt resonated with me: paganism. Now I’m pagan. My parents are still Muslim, as is my entire family, back to my ancestors probably. But I am not. My parents didn’t force me to pray to their God and didn’t use it in my day to day life to threaten me with things. Maybe that’s why I wasn’t succumbed to the religion; there was no fear mongering or brainwashing in my family.

For female animals they make an incision and basically tie their tubes (spaying) and for male animals they make an incision at the sack, remove them, remove the skin, and suture (neutering). They need usually a week average, sometimes two to heal and should avoid energetic playing or jumping too much and most need to wear cones or onesies to avoid biting or licking the sutures off. 


A lot of vet clinics on their website have sidebars that show info and stuff for making a fix appointment.

They even have specifically spay and neuter clinics and offices that offer cheaper services for people (like me) who are poor and can’t afford 2-400 dollars depending on where. I got my cat fixed for 75 dollars and they were so, so professional, so kind, and very respectful people."
