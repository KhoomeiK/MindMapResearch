I also talked to a psychiatrist and will continue to do so. Thank you so much for asking. 😊💕"
depression,erzdu7n,t3_c4iofv,1561432795.0,"Anxiety and depressed since 13 yo. Am about 37 yo now.

There has always been a struggle. The only time I was truly happy was when I got a amazing gf. It only lasted for months and life is worse after knowing the feeling of such a relationship. People get into new ones all the time. My confidence, social anxiety... It makes it too hard. 
So no, it has not been worth living all these years."
depression,erzcnqh,t3_c4jmzu,1561431821.0,"I've noticed that when I (a male), talks about my problems with a female they tend to take a step back. I've learned that if I'm interested in someone, never tell her about your problems.
Don't show her any weakness."
freelanceWriters,eregbn5,t1_eqvu4ip,1560783383.0,"You do realize that this is a tool to collect the info I want to use in my article?

Where do you get your info from if you can't get it directly from the source?"
zoloft,ereegrq,t3_br0vfo,1560782013.0,"I haven't used the same medication but a SNRI, which is pretty similar since it affects serotonin.

My interests in my old hobbies like watching movies and pc gaming didn't interest me anymore.

I also stopped party/drinking with my friends.

I've been off all medications for months now but nothing is interesting.
I really hate to live this way because I also don't have any motivation for work.
I don't make enough money. Been thinking about the quick way out for quite some time."
freelanceWriters,equxuy5,t1_equkx0g,1560337546.0,"Ok, but it could be used for collecting information faster. Im not talking about spinning articles, complete rewrites based on the info collected. But sure , it depends on how you use the application."
absolutelynotme_irl,equ6um6,t3_bzlvjn,1560325478.0,Use a drill. It's easier and it makes the hole look better without marks at the sides.
freelanceWriters,eqtfu64,t1_eqtfh0x,1560310827.0,"I would call it a tool to quickly collect info. Then i manually sort out what I want to write about. Everything will be rewritten. I'm not trying to come up with a story, or make up features that isn't in the software."
lonely,eqsc2ym,t1_eqq8i56,1560281484.0,"Different in what way if you care to explain? For the better, or did you somehow get used to being alone and accepted the feelings? Or maybe something better? :)"
gamedev,eqsba1y,t3_bzfjep,1560280961.0,"If the game really is good. Start with giving away some keys to people that run blogs, any kind of review sites, youtube-channels.

Of people start to put content out there, it might start to spread even more.

Hold contests on your website to win free keys or pay smaller blogs for posts ""write a short post about this game and link to my site""....

Be active in forums with games in the same niche, programming forums, basically anywhere you can get your link out."
Effexor,epqht2g,t3_btyyus,1559406061.0,Effexor doesn't work like that. You can't just take more and expect it to get better right away. Read about how your medication works.
Effexor,ep6ne91,t1_ep1vvni,1559071254.0,"Your post made me call the doctors office and I got a meeting booked next month. I've been wanting to contact them for a very long time. But as always ""I'll do it tomorrow"". 

My business is going really bad right now. I'm losing money right now actually. 

I just want to tell you I'm really thankful for your replies. It gave me the kick in the ass I needed to finally contact them again. Thank you."
Effexor,ep19xjx,t1_eozass6,1558986509.0,"Thank you for your reply!

I've been on different SSRIs, last time I told the doctor that I wanted to try something else than SSRI. I really need motivation to function in life (life everyone) and I have non. That's when she prescribed me venlafaxine. :/
I was on venlafaxine for a year or a bit more than that I think. 

I've been depressed since i was 12-13. And I'm 36+ now.
I feel that i know what's life about. At my age you should have some kind of idea. I don't want my to live my life alone, i don't want to wake up to the same sh*t over and over. 

Suicide is a way out but i don't know of i could do it. I think about it several times everyday. 

There is nothing for me here."
