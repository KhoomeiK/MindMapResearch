maninthehighcastle,fp0g9uq,t3_gajvev,1588208678.0,"The only part of the ending that I liked (a word I use lightly) is John Smith’s conclusion. His own actions destroyed the family he was trying to protect— one daughter is distancing herself from him, the other spouts Nazi rhetoric whether he likes it or not, and his wife is dead. Ultimately, he destroyed himself. If they were going to keep him as a “faithful” Nazi, that was the way to end his story.

I wanted to see some sort of redemption/sacrifice story with him. It seemed that was where they were going, especially with his guilt in the wake of the memories of the friend he let go to the camps and even some of the promotional images, and then he suddenly veered off in the wrong direction. It felt abrupt to me, but it was still the better part of a larger ending I was deeply disappointed in.

It sounds like she’s trying to deflect because she doesn’t know how to take it when she goes too far and someone calls her out.

It’s also been my experience that people who don’t rely on medication to have a full life tend to underestimate how important it is, especially if they haven’t seen the effects of its absence.

Let her sulk. It’s such an immature reaction. Later, you might want to have a heart to heart with her about boundaries.

Bullies are not always the big oaf shaking smaller kids down for their lunch money. It’s not always that brazen, and it sure isn’t always in front of us.

Bullies can be so smart about what they do. They say things under their breath. They wait until we’ve circulated to another part of the classroom or cafeteria to say something nasty. Sometimes, out of apathy, fear, or perhaps because they’re in on it, other kids often cover for these people when we try to investigate. There have been kids who I’ve suspected or just known— call it a gut feeling. But we can’t accuse, not if we didn’t see it for ourselves. We have to tiptoe around the situation and pray we’re asking the right questions of the right people when we try to figure out what’s really going on.

There’s also the issue of not knowing a full situation. Is the bully the aggressor, or has someone been goading them? I’ve seen kids “poke the bear” so to speak for the express purpose of being able to report a kid that they don’t like. 

I try to be smart about it. I try to keep my eyes open. When I do catch something, and I have many times, I’m very quick about letting the right people know. The principal is notified before the kid even leaves my class, and parents are notified before the kid leaves the building.

Same thing with illness. We are imperfect beings inhabiting imperfect vessels— they malfunction on their own, they react adversely to things they come in contact with. 

With that said, yes, He might have created viruses and bacteria that can make us ill and potentially kill us. None of us know— we weren’t there and germ theory wasn’t exactly around at the time Genesis was written, but we can make an assumption that He did.

Teachers,fleymuu,t3_fodowh,1585094201.0,"I’ll be honest, I’m stressed out but enjoying it all at once. It’s different! I just wish I’d seen it coming sooner and planned ahead a little, but that’s how these situations are.

There’s so much I’m thinking of doing with the kids now that I might not be able to do otherwise!

Not to mention that I LOVE working from home!"
truechildfree,fletnt1,t1_fleswed,1585091313.0,"Yeah, it just seems like you guys were on two totally separate wavelengths.

I think that you really, *really* need to want to be a parent to be even remotely successful at it. Working with kids is equal parts rewarding and stressful. I teach middle school, myself. I ADORE my kids! I absolutely love them! They drive me CRAZY sometimes!

That's the closest I've come to having a ""maternal instinct"". I love having them for a little while, but then I love passing them back to their parents at the end of the day. That's what I'm wired for. I've known it ever since I was old enough to understand what parenting entails.

With that said, I know lots of people who are just meant to be parents. You can just tell that that sort of life suits them perfectly. They truly enjoy their children, and I think that's key. We see so many people complaining about their kids 24/7 that it's almost weird to us when we see someone who LIKES doing it!"

truechildfree,flesncs,t3_fof1y9,1585090731.0,"Maybe she thought that you didn't necessarily mind kids themselves, but the long-term commitment of being responsible for raising a human being is what makes it a no for you?

Not defending the question, I'm just trying to wrap my head around where that question came from. People have a lot of misconceptions about the commitment level that fostering demands. 

Either way, it looks like both of you saved yourselves a LOT of time and heartbreak by talking about this early on!"
MakeupEducation,fleg7a8,t3_fo98q0,1585083778.0,"Good on you for trying a wing! It was the hardest thing for me to learn. You've chosen some GREAT colors for your skin tone!!!

It looks like you've got round, slightly hooded eyes. I have hooded eyes, too, so here's what I do: 

1. Prime your eyes and put your brow bone color (for me it's usually whatever shade is closest to my own skin color) and place it all above your crease where blending will take place.
2. Stamp your crease color (place the shadow-- no blending yet!) with a brush. This part is important: Do not place the color where you want to see it. Place it just inside that area.  
3. With a fluffy brush (this could be a new one or the same one you used for placing the color-- just make sure the excess shadow is off of it), gently blend your crease color up and out until you're happy with it. It should be a gentle gradient.
4. For winged liner, do not raise your brow, pull at your skin, or close your eyes. Relax your face and look straight on at the mirror and gently draw the outline of your wing with your brush or felt-tip. You can fill it in later. I like to draw the part that hugs my lashline first, then the wing, but you can obviously do that in whatever order you'd like.

I hope this was helpful to you and not too much of an information dump! As has been said already, makeup is supposed to be fun! Don't be discouraged, and keep practicing! Good luck!"
AskWomen,flec96w,t3_fo4mhl,1585081601.0,"My parents would have been thrilled. His parents would have been thrilled. People would have romanticized it-- high school sweethearts! We went to our senior prom together! 

We would have divorced. I know it for sure.

To start, I would have had to listen to his constant monologue on why everything sucks, but none of it is his fault. I know he hasn't changed because I actually spoke to him years after we'd broken up. Nothing but complaining. I was the type to just put up with things to keep the peace when I started dating him, so I would have put up with it, but been completely miserable.

If I didn't acknowledge him as the ""smart one"" in the relationship, he'd be deeply offended. Again, anything to keep the peace, right? I'll pretend to be ""the stupid one"", because clearly there *needs* to be a stupid one in the relationship.

He would push the idea of us having kids almost immediately because ""that's just the next step"". I'd have been expected to leave my job to be a stay at home mom whether I wanted to or not.

I would have started antagonizing him just for the hell of it, because that's what I used to do when he called me stupid. We were ridiculously terrible for each other. 

Somewhere along the line, something would have been the breaking point. 

God, I'm glad that didn't happen."
