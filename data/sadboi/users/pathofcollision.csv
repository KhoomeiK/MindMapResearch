AskMen,fqojiov,t1_fqobh4f,1589516692.0,"I can see some of your points but I think it's worth mentioning that women, historically, have carried the burden of raising children wherein men have held the ability to run away from that responsibility. Having a safe and legal abortion has only even been an option to women in the US since the mid 60s. Furthermore, women did not possess the ability to use birth control contraceptive or make decisions for themselves until somewhat recently. So your argument is a moot point because that is STILL an issue women are battling worldwide and men in many places of the world still control their wife and the decisions surrounding the wife's body.

Regarding adoption, not sure which geographical location you're referring to but my state doesnt allow mothers to place a baby up for adoption without the biological fathers consent (obvious loop holes aside). Having an abortion is seen as this oversimplification to a complicated ordeal and there are a lot of guys who don't fully grasp the emotional and physical toll that takes on a woman.

Men AND women should take all precautions available to prevent a pregnancy they're not ready for. The problem is, many people dont. They dont take birth control correctly, they dont use condoms, they participate in one night stands or other forms of casual sex. Abortion shouldn't be viewed as a form of backup birth control and if i were a man i would do my part to prevent pregnancy and always wear a condom. Is it 100% effective? No, only abstinence is..but regardless of your gender, if you do not take all measures to prevent pregnancy (or even any measures) you dont have a valid or legitimate reason to even be surprised when you're dealing with an unplanned pregnancy.

And given the fact that the final say does rest with the woman, I would think this would make a man even more cautious, but then again look at how many men casually hook up with women and are irresponsible.

I fully grasp the point you're wanting to make, but you need to keep in mind that my opinion surrounding this is exclusively pointed at men who DON'T wear condoms."
AskMen,fqnp9tb,t1_fqnnbbn,1589498943.0,"Im more concerned with your thoughts/mentality pertaining to sex and women.

It's also suggested to refrain from casual sex as you increase your exposure rate."
AskMen,fqnlr4s,t1_fqnl49l,1589497128.0,"Again, this is a different situation. You should always have a conversation with partners about contraceptive usage and you should always use a condom. Its equally as foolish for women to engage in sexual activity without protection.

You're not fully understanding my original comment and fabricating situations irrelevant to what I'm saying to support your viewpoint.

All people, regardless of gender, should participate in SAFE sex. This includes birth control AND condoms. When both are used simultaneously and correctly, the odds of an unplanned pregnancy occurring are exceedingly low."
AskMen,fqnk4nx,t1_fqniz0w,1589496292.0,That's a different situation entirely. I'm specifically speaking to the men who refuse or opt to not wear a condom.
AskMen,fqncdbk,t1_fqmqy77,1589492358.0,"On the 'consenting to parenthood' bit, I view it similarly, but with men who opt to NOT wear a condom during sex. Women who take birth control are doing their part, I put wearing a condom on men as THEIR birth control. The guys who refuse or decide not to, imho, are consenting to parenthood in the event that a womans birth control contraceptive fails. If you as a man dont want a baby, then you need to be cognizant of this fact and do your part to prevent unplanned pregnancies. There's really no excuse or valid reasoning for a man not to wear a condom if he doesnt want to risk an unplanned pregnancy.

It would be just as ludacris for a woman to participate in unprotected sex without birth control of some form."

Our relationship was failing after 5 years of being together. It had been rocky for awhile. I was nearly at my breaking point with things and on the verge of asking her to move out.

I had been out studying most of the day for a really big exam. I came home anticipating I'd make some dinner for us and then study for an hour or two longer before calling it a night.

I came home to find her drunk, borderline black out drunk at that, crying and saying she wanted to die. I spent the entire night taking care of her while she belligerently sobbed and said the most absurd things to me. The very next day she had the audacity to criticize me for how I cared for her...when she put herself in that situation...two days before one of the biggest exams of the semester for me.

I asked her to move out that day and we ended up separating. 

Mental illness is a very debilitating thing to battle and i learned a lot about being patient. However, I also learned that you're only capable of helping someone so much, especially if they're not willing to help themselves. It's easier for someone else to pull you down than it is for you to pull them up.

I grew up surrounded by nurses, but never felt it was for me. Then I got pregnant at 18. My NP was the one who told me I was going to be a mother. She held my hand every step of the way throughout my complicated pregnancy. My L&D nurse held me hand throughout my entire birthing experience, never once judged me for how young I was. When I was 19 I went back to college and pursued nursing full heartedly while raising my baby as a single mother. When I was 23 I put myself through CNA school and while caring a patient who was severely disabled, the patient said to me, ""there are a lot people who think they can do this, who think they have it in them, but they don't. You have it in you"". She passed away shortly after that, but I never forgot those words. When I was 26 I graduated from nursing school, my 7 year old son pinned me at my pinning ceremony while I cried. 

Being a nurse is not simply just something you do, I full heartedly believe it is who you are. So many of us are called to nursing with a profoundly overwhelming drive to better humanity and to help others.

Nurse,fortfiz,t3_g960zv,1588018202.0,"I'm a Registered Nurse, here's what I've seen/noted:

1. Some nurses did not work as a CNA prior and really don't understand how physically demanding the job is. In a lot of SNF the CNAs work short and their ratios are high. It's a very tiring and back breaking job.
2. As an RN I have seen some (not all by any means, but some) CNAs exert zero effort, regard, or common sense when providing care for patients and this in turn can make the job more difficult and taxing on the nurse because the nurse to patient ratio is 2-4x higher than the CNA to patient ratio. To expand on this, I have personally worked with CNAs whom I have walked into patient rooms and seen them on their phone texting or scrolling through social media. I have recieved vital signs after they were taken and the vitals were NOT stable, I was not alerted to this change in condition, and the CNA did not even bother to look at the parameters to decipher if they were within normal limits. This is not just a lack of training, but a lapse in judgement because you are taught this in CNA school and parameters are (***should be***) listed in clear sight for CNAs to reference when taking vital signs. 
3. As a nurse, I rely heavily on my CNAs because they have the ability to spend more one on one time with my patients. When I work with CNAs that I cant trust to work effectively with me or they dont provide sufficient care, it makes my job harder. I work OT every shift with no breaks. I am interrupted over a dozen times throughout my assessments and med passes
 

As a nurse, you learn very quickly which CNAs you can count on and which ones you cannot. And I think it's important to note, I was a CNA/HHA for 7 years prior to becoming an RN so I hold my CNAs to a high standard, but I also respect and value what they bring to the table because I did it for so long. I help my CNAs whenever possible, I clearly state and list my expectations and as a result my team functions pretty well together. Disciplinary action takes place only after I've stated my expectations clearly and it fell on deaf ears. My patients deserve high quality care."

Yes, anxiety can and indeed does trigger GI symptoms. There's a lot of research that's coming out now that tells about the actual science behind this and it's quite fascinating. However, to summarize, your anxiety will inevitably trigger you sympathetic nervous system, the system that controls and manages your fight or flight response. Anxiety will place you in a consist mode of this if you're experiencing it often enough. While your adrenaline is going, your bodily systems (like your GI) will naturally slow down in function because if your life is endangered, your body's priority is not going to be digestion. This, over time, can wreak havoc on your body and create a domino effect of digestive ailments: diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, you name it. I deal with all of it semi regularly and what's really helped me is this:

Practice regrounding exercises (meditation and reality orientation), I have also been taking Celexa for over a year now to help treat my anxiety and it has drastically improved my anxiety and subsequently my stomach woes. When that's not enough, I have lorazepam. Do some inner digging and try to pinpoint what your triggers are and remember those things while you're anxious so that you have something concrete to stick it to. That has helped me rationalize the irrational, so to speak, and I've been able to tell myself that ""it's okay, I'm anxious because ___ and this too shall pass"""

EKG/ECG rhythms will display past heart attacks. The damage the ischemia causes to your heart, changes the way in which your heart functions. You can pinpoint where the heart attack is occurring or where it occurred via a 12 lead EKG/ECG.

Women display signs of a heart attack differently, so I am appreciative of this post because it's a conversation more women should have. If you have a family history of heart attacks, especially immediate family (mom, dad, brother, sister) you're at an increased risk. Particularly if the heart attack occured under the age of 50-55.

Increased risk factors include:
Drug/alcohol abuse, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet (diets involving high sodium, processed foods, red meat, etc), smoking (seriously, quit smoking. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor which leads to increased blood pressure, which over time can damage your vessels and your heart, among many other issues)."

I think a really valuable and important boundary to set and enforce within any relationship is to ALWAYS treat one another with respect.

AskWomen,fhviebz,t3_f4ol7x,1581897709.0,"Growing up my dad was always fluctuating between extreme diet plans and I really didnt like it. It was something he implemented in my life, too. We are talking flax seed everything, the bread that is so densely made with seeds and berries that it's an entire meal on it's own, and whole wheat pancakes.. no sweets hardly ever.

It drove me insane growing up and I remember hoarding candy and sweets and running through them when I got my hands on them.

I have never had an issue with weight (of anything I've always been very underweight). So this wasnt the drawback behind my purging or my fathers obsessive dieting. 

As I got older, i took nutrition in college and discovered things I was actually interested in, how to eat things in moderation and how to balance my diet. Now when I go grocery shopping, I mostly buy healthy things, but I absolutely am sure to have an abundance of sweets around...just because lol I do like a few pieces of candy throughout the day."

relationship_advice,ff9frn5,t3_es8jy7,1579712067.0,"(26F) went through the same exact thing only I was forcibly raped for over a year by a past partner. Sex has always been difficult for me emotionally. I have flip flopped between using it as a coping mechanism and feeling like it was the only thing people wanted from me and the only way I could keep anyone around, to being honest with myself about the things I actually enjoy sexually and dont enjoy sexually. I am learning to practice setting boundaries and stating matter of factly what my boundaries are, I am also learning to take back the power my ex held over me. I dont HAVE to have sex with anyone, not even the person I am dating. I am not obligated to. I also recognize I dont HAVE to put up with anyone disrespecting my wants, needs, and wishes. This stems from relearning about myself, accepting what happened to me was not my fault, transforming my trauma is something I no long need to feel ashamed of.

Talk to her. Ask for consent, dont assume its given. And watch her body language during sex or any sexual activities.

I have gone from nearly orgasming to hysterically crying during sex because I was triggered in the moment. Be compassionate and loving and supportive."

WomensHealth,fel8f1e,t3_epplak,1579216302.0,"I use Skoon and I love it :) I am a petite woman with light and short periods and I find using tampons to be uncomfortable. 

Pros: you can wear them up to 12hrs (variant upon your flow and preferences), they're easy to sterilize and clean, you become more in touch with your own body, the cups dont dry you out or disrupt the flora of your vagina in the same way tampons or pads can.

Cons: you kind of have to be strategic in how you use them. For example, if you've had it in for awhile and you know you'll need to dump it and clean it soon, you should do so before leaving the house or make sure wherever you're going has a single person bathroom. Or you can carry a water bottle with you and some wet wipes. I have done both and the last option is tricky and not preferable. You also need to make sure your hands are clean BEFORE you insert or remove your cup. I have had issues with yeast infections and BV due to frequently needing to insert or remove a cup and using my hands."

One patient in particular stands out. Middle aged male who was on iso precautions for a rule out. He was Hoyer lift and wanted to go outside for a cigarette. I politely reminded him that due to him being on isolation precautions we were unable to have him leave the room. He then began cussing at me and tried to punch me. At the time I was 24 years old and 105lbs. I dodged him, thankfully and then set firm boundaries and told him that I would NOT be back in to care for him until he apologized to me and learned to respect me. I also reminded him that I was a small young woman and me being his nurse gives him no right to hit me, or anyone for that matter.

I then left the room and did exactly as I said I would. About 45min later he called me in and apologized to me."

Its actually really difficult for me to orgasm with a partner..its not that i'm not able to, its because I dont always feel comfortable doing so. I feel I take too long and then I cant or I'm too overwhelmed by the feeling and i fight it mentally and am unable to relax enough to finish.

Nurse,fdjhb5r,t1_fdj2gwu,1578470797.0,"Heres my stance on this, as a new grad RN working in LTC:

LTC is notoriously stigmatized and it's related to a considerable amount of LTC facilities being poorly managed and the nurse patient ratios being high, burn out rates being high, etc.

Heres what I did:
I looked up 5 star facilities in my area and thoroughly researched the ones that popped up. What did patients have to say in reviews, what do employees say in reviews? And then I took it one step further and I toured the facility posing as a family member. I just walked in and walked around the facility. I noted how the CNAs and nurses looked, how they interacted with patients, how the patients looked, etc. If I liked what I saw I applied.

But here's what you need to understand about LTC: 
it is very different from a hospital in that your patients are not coming and going frequently, you will have dementia and alzheimers patients that may be difficult, combative, or experience behavioral outbursts, you will experience sundowners, you will deal with incontinence issues, you will even deal with psych patients who cannot be placed elsewhereyou will get very close to them and know their behaviors and routines extensively, you will learn how to properly manage your time because your nurse to patient ratio will be much higher than that of an acute care setting...but it's not always as overwhelming as it seems because you learn very quickly

In the time I've been in LTC I have worked with IVs, PEG tubes, I have impeccable time management skills, I have the autonomy to write orders and implement them prior to MD authorization (within reason), I have learned to trust my own judgement because theres no MD or NP to fall back on, I have worked with hospice and palliative care patients, I have had to pull out the crash cart, I have had to be on an ethics committee and be a patient advocate, and its helped me develop my leadership skills as I am the one managing the CNAs (and LVNs at times)

Is it my dream job? No. Am I planning to stay in LTC for the duration of my career? No. Do I regret accepting the job? Absolutely not. I love what I do and I love my patients and the intimate relationships I've formed with them. They grow to trust you and become very connected to you. You become their voice and an extension of their family.

Do not dismiss this as a good first job. I was told the exact same thing in nursing school and it made me feel hopeless when I graduated and couldnt find a job. I finally emailed my fundamentals professor and asked her if it was really THAT bad of a career move and she told me she worked in LTC as a new grad and it helped her immensely when she moved into the hospital two years later and that she had never once regretted where she started. 

Get your foot in where you can. LTC is really what you make of it and theres SO, SO, SO many valuable things you can learn. The key is to go in with a clear lense, be open minded and absorb all the good things you can. Theres bad everywhere, including in the hospital.  PLUS, you just might get lucky and land a dayshift position like I did:)"

relationships,fdcujbe,t3_ekkuq8,1578284706.0,"Firstly, how he talked to you was out of line and completely disrespectful.

At some point you should also be granted that same luxury and he should rotate household chores and getting up with the kids. That way you both contribute to things equally. 

Secondly, you need to have a serious discussion with him about how he talks to you. I absolutely would NOT tolerate my partner speaking to me in that way. Theres no reason for it.

Them temporarily making effort for a week or two and then going right back to being unproductive and lazy.

After 5 years (3 where I felt fully taken for granted, unappreciated, and it being an expected job for me to take care of them) I called it off and asked them to move out. To which they told me when they left I'd finally see how much they did and I'd be sorry.

...ironically, nothing was any different when they left except I had LESS stress and LESS to do..I actually realized how alone I'd been in my relationship and was so grateful I finally put MYSELF first.
