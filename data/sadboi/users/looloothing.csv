And the kicker is, I took the cupcakes anyway! At the time I didn't realize how shitty that was to do to someone. Especially someone who was genuinely a  friend. I didn't even process that that wasn't kind. Oh my gosh, every time I think about it I cringe and feel so bad.

On top of that my mom was hiding behind the door when it happened, mortified, and she just won't let me live it down.

About 7 months in he dipped with no warning, and told me immigration got him at the airport. I was so so worried.
