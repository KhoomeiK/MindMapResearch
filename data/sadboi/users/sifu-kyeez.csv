First office I was with was the Xfinity retail campaign. The next one I did and had “success” in was the AT&T b2b campaign. I won’t lie, I enjoyed the people I worked with and learned a lot, but there’s something to be said about false promises and the abuse of the so called “employee.” Office owners take sales to keep the lights on during slow periods. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. They actually had a lot of faith in me. Sent me to Cartagena, Colombia for a retreat and stuff. I honestly believe I milked them before they milked me too much harder but in the end it evened out. None the less I’ll never join another organization like that again. At least now I know how to sell ice to an eskimo though. I’d rather use that skill in a legitimate business."

However, Google Docs bas improved quite a bit. I encourage you to try it if you have some free time. If that still doesn’t work then I’d run over to best buy and buy a cheap laptop for work. 

I’m unsure of what you use the Office Suite for but in my experience watching others; I’ve never really seen anyone do super intense work through the version that is installed to your drive. It’s usually something very simple."
raisedbynarcissists,fdokexn,t3_em4ipf,1578606927.0,"This is very true. I’m glad someone pointed it out. Something that haunts me is that I’ll become a carbon copy of my father through proximity. 

Granted my dad does do awesome things at times. Nice gestures towards me and my kiddos. But the balance is not there. He believes he’s superior and all that narc shit. 

I recently took my kids to visit one of my friends who’d seen my little munchkins when they were way younger. They saw me handle a less than favorable situation without being aggressive or dismissive with the situation. They told me I was a great father and honestly it brought out some tears. I don’t mean to make it about me here. But sometimes I have no where else to share the good or bad things in my life with anyone and it’s so refreshing to be able to align with posts like this. Much loves to you and your family sir. May I grow to emulate your ability to be an amazing dad."

raisedbynarcissists,fc91b6d,t1_fc6g9ti,1577545421.0,I remember being a kid who loved to spend the night elsewhere at a friend’s house just to get away.

NarcissisticAbuse,fc6jsuz,t1_fc533lc,1577482266.0,This exactly. They never apologize. They just act like nothing happened. Such a cowards way to solve a problem. Yet when it’s them who feel wronged they force an apology out from us and it has to “sound like an apology.”

raisedbynarcissists,fc21srs,t1_fc21pjw,1577337044.0,This 100%. I feel like communicating takes too much effort and sometimes it feels risky. No conversation feels better than bad conversations. Just to be frank. It's probably not good but that's how it feels.
raisedbynarcissists,fc21h6i,t1_fc215z1,1577336707.0,"In a way, once you've been victim to it  long enough and had to ""take the high road"" so many times; you have a huge example of what not to be. So it's not terribly difficult. I just don't think it was fair to my ex how often this would ruin my day and stuff. I'd just shut out the world and eventually it affects her too, you know?"
raisedbynarcissists,fc20uvl,t1_fc20qih,1577336055.0,"Yeah. I’m much more aware of making sure I don’t emulate the same behavior. I just got out of a 7 year relationship and there have definitely been days where my father was a negative influence on the day somehow. After being away and coming back the attitude is horrible. I just wonder how I ever dealt with it in high school.

Then my father calls me down and didn't hear my reply so he loses his shit and along the way tells me ""oh fuck you."" So there's that. I knew it was fucking coming at some point in the day. Seriously sick of this guy's crap and his constant yelling. He really believes nothing is wrong with him. Talking to him is like trying to play chess with a pigeon. It's terrible.

I do a little verbal story that ends up with the joker dead using some of the sleights I learned on the channel. I think the Bertram change is what it was called. Make sure it's a ""busy"" looking card too. Too much white negative space makes the effect seem like an afterthought.

The change also happened out of frame so you'd attract hecklers who said you did something off camera and discredit your performance based on that.
iOSBeta,fbpjtwu,t3_edwoy1,1577021829.0,What I've noticed is that some of the more detailed features will stop performing based on the order the iDevice reconnected to your BT peripherals. For me it's usually the keyboard. The mouse is so ambitious that the keyboard lags on beating the mouse to the handshake after waking from sleep. Then I have to basically reconnect the mouse after the keyboard. Try this but in your case you would swap the mouse and keyboard order.

PokemonMasters,fbn3jgj,t3_e772w6,1576992256.0,I for one would love PvP. Just because some of you enjoy single player you want to prevent others from having their preference implemented.
