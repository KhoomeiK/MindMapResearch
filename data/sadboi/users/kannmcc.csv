They have a beautiful home and are near family. They're healthy despite past illness and injury. Seems like they're in a new phase of life and it's a good one.

I’m not sure how much you know about fertility but people now are literally 50% less fertile than their grandparents were. 1 in 7 deal with infertility. Of course, there are so many children out there that need safe and loving homes, but it’s not fair to push that on every person who deals with this issue. Not to mention, the prospective child. My husband was adopted and had a very negative experience. It’s for that reason that it’s most likely not an option for us. 

Unexplained infertility is something that most people don’t understand. It’s not black and white. We have no answer as to what the problem is and if it will ever be fixed. It’s not as simple as Plan A, Plan B, DONE!

We pay so fucking much for our healthcare and the out of pocket each year is insane. It adds a whole different level of stress to deal with financial burden. 

There are states with mandated coverage - do we uproot our lives and move there? There are employers like Starbucks that provide coverage - do I quit my career to go work there?"
TTC30,fi1zb2q,t3_f604w5,1582067956.0,"My doctor reminds me every single time I'm in the office that 20% of infertility is female, 20% is male, 20% is both, and the remaining 40% is completely unexplained. Of course, you can get tested and find out if you have roadblocks, then you'll know exactly what type of intervention path to go down. However, there are a lotttttt of people who've been trying for a very very very long time in that 40% space. 

Think of it this way: women in their 20s have a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant any given month. At 30, that drops to 15% any given month and then at 35 it drops to 10%.  If you're anxious to see results more quickly then the more knowledge you have (testing) may help you. Your doctor may even start you on some early treatment methods. But you may end up in that 40% category and just need to continue rolling your 10 sided die every month for awhile."
