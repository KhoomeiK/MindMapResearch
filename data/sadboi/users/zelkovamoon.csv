tech,fr27oql,t3_gm0o0q,1589832565.0,"All these people implying that life was better before you could keep in contact with literally anyone you care about regardless of distance, learn practically anything, and access goods, services and make transactions with an incredibly high efficiency.

You would never go back to the way it was, really. Because it was worse. This is *actually in reality* far far better, it's just more fun to pine for days that weren't actually good because we have good imaginations and selective memory, and like to pretend like they were better.

Not everything about the digital information Era is good for humanity. But the idea that things were better in the past isn't helpful, and it really needs to be put to rest forever."

I was working in IT, so theoretically that would have been experience; but I realize now it would have been smarter to just take an internship and take the loss, to make new connections.

The plan for now is probably to quit my job soon and just push hard into getting certs. I can survive off of savings for a while."

I have been engaged in moving forward in every way I know how. Every job already wants a pro. Don't have five years experience in a niche framework or tool you've never heard of until this job posting? Sucks to be you. The jobs that list qualifications I can match either don't call back, or aren't an upgrade. Recruiters are highly risk averse and will not hire if you're not local. 

Maybe some have had a different experience, but IT as a field so far has been nothing but a giant lie.

I work overtime almost every week. If I didn't live in a family home, I would be struggling financially. Where are all the jobs? Where's the promise of this industry? Why do I hate computers now?"

It's never easy to lose someone you have feelings for, even if it was for a short time.

Find little things that give you joy. Other suggestions to help avoid thinking about them too much are smart, but you won't be able to avoid it of course. 

Anything to.. Distract you when you feel like you're stuck thinking about them. Rumination will make a painful situation harder. And when it's really hard, reach out and support others - at least that's what helps me.

I sincerely hope you feel better soon."

Anxiety,eteoh0i,t1_etenysa,1562739980.0,Always remember that *you* have the power to make things better. Your therapist and others will help you on your journey. Never give up on yourself!
Anxiety,eteneun,t3_cbcpdq,1562738845.0,"You did the right thing by reaching out for help.

A fear like yours can be really hard to grapple with; but you can stop this fear and take control. Breathe deeply. Try to focus on it for a minute.. It will help you calm down a little. 

Being in a constant state of anxiety can reinforce those negative feelings you are having, but you can take control. You can make things better, and you can prevent your fears from becoming reality. You really can do it. 

Please be sure to reach out when you feel panic coming, there are chat rooms with others who will understand and listen. I'm really glad you have reached out tonight. 

If your current therapist isn't helping much, maybe you should consider switching to another one; sometimes a different personality can make all the difference. 

Others will be able to say more, I apologize I can't be of further help to you; please look into breathing, and meditation. Your anxiety is fueled by fearful thoughts that can be hard to avoid; if you can break the repetitive cycle of negative thoughts by thinking about something that makes you happy, or watching a funny video or show, or playing a game, it can really help. 

Contgratulations on graduating, by the way, that's a fantastic achievement.

You can get better. You are strong!"
Anxiety,etemfzq,t3_cbcmq7,1562737800.0,"Please take a moment to breathe

In times of high stress, it helps to know that you can regain control; it will take practice, but for now know that this is something you *can* accomplish and it will make your anxiety easier to deal with.

Many doctors really care about their patients and want them to feel comfortable; It would be good to just.. Try to communicate that you are nervous, they should take things at a pace you can handle. Its hard to feel good about going right now, but you are doing the right thing to take care of your health and you are being strong by deciding to overcome your basic fear and going.

In times of anxiety and fear, I have heard that it is best to break the chain of rumination by using distractions. Consider playing a game, or watching a funny video. Or listening to something interesting. Don't let your fear take you over; it's going to be ok. You can do this. And taking care of yourself is absolutely a good idea. 

Breathe, it's going to be ok."
