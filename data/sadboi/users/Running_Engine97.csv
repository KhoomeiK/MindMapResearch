mentalhealth,f2f88hi,t1_f2f5vo7,1570212789.0,"Well, now that I'm calmer, I'll elaborate.

It FEELS unfair at times. I'm a 22, and my family helps me financially in college since i started in 2017. Having them help is a HUGE strain off of my back, and I'll be eternally grateful, I should be fine, right? Well, generally I am. I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2014, and let me tell you, it makes one think of challenges and obstacles as a life or death situation even though it isn't, it's pretty damn horrible, it makes those moments where I'm on edge feel like hell. 

Sorry if I worded my post weirdly, being on edge does that to me."
