I can hear him proceed to the kitchen and then he started yelling at my little brother, who was up by himself but I didnt know. My mom was sleeping. So I hear step dad tell things about ""You could have died"" Hes literally losing his shit so I jump up and run out. This 5 year old boy took my moms coffee percolator and prepared coffee for my mom. Only problem is that he put the percolator in the sink full of water while plugged in. The plug is the kind with metal rods that are plugged into the percolator. He could have electrocuted himself! And has likely ruined the best coffee maker Ive ever used. Well so my moms heard the shouting and came out and literally said the same thing I did, ""Whoa!""  Step dad is having trouble getting across the real danger brother was in and brother is having a hard time feeling remorse for his actions. So step disappears and reappears with one of those large batteries and asks him to stick his tongue out. Step dad asks brother if he wants to die. He demands he put his tongue on the battery. Im standing in the backroom listening with my eyes open. This kid is now a blubbering mess. He thinks hes gonna get hurt badly or worse die. He is convinced. Hes crying so hard hes having trouble performing the desire action. Eventually after a few minutes of demanding and yelling he eventually does it and its not that bad. But damn. Is this insaneparents?"
