It may actually be helpful to get a full diagnostic assessment. You need to truly break down all your triggers, memories etc, understand them and how to work around it. You may end up finding out that there's more than just narcissism at play. Only someone who's qualified can help you on that journey.
I've started my journey and already we (myself and my psychiatrist) have pinpointed possible ADHD, this has led to me being set with a diagnostic assessment in the near future.

 *COMPARTMENTALISE - never bring the stress from work home or vice versa. 

*Understand YOUR employee rights and legislations in accordance with the company you work for and the broader umbrella set by government and also the legal rights of the consumer (even if relaying the latter to customers isn't in your job description). 

*See your job for what it is and what it can bring you - minimise forming emotional attachments to it or the people you're working with (making true friends and/or meeting the ""love"" of your life at work - if it's MEANT to happen, it will happen organically over time, don't push for it). 

*Remove emotion from your work and never take any interactions with customers seriously at all.

*Understand your official capabilities in the confines of your job description and do your best for customers within that AND ONLY WITHIN THAT.

*Wherever possible try NOT to wear your name badge or keep it hidden and your appearance generic. 

*If customer/s push for more than what you can provide signpost them to a manager, if one isn't available apologise sincerely while making an exit to find a supervisor or anyone of an equal footing (this makes it appear that you are going the ""extra mile"") entitled customers eat that up like hot shit.

This next one Is quite manipulative (it also merges with the previous point) but I guarantee it to be the most effective in turning a KAREN/DAVID  customer into your closest ally:

*If a Karen/David has had some negative experiences with the company you work for AND it's also a company YOU hate working for, slip in some vague empathy for how they feel as if you understand thier woes, while giving them the opportunity (and contact details of upper management - ensuring your name badge isn't and WASN'T visible) to actively complain to the relevant people. Explain to them that doing so will get thier issues heard and hopefully conditions will improve for workers (paint them to be a hero, they'll love the delusion). 

*AND ABOVE ALL ELSE, DO ALL THE ABOVE WITH A KILLER SMILE, A COUPLE OF WITTY AD LIBS AND A SEEMINGLY CALM POSITIVE TEMPERAMENT (compartmentalising will allow you to do this effectively)."
