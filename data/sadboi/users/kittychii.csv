1/4 teaspoon vanilla essence (can be omitted)  
2 tablespoons Cocoa   
1/3 cup plain flour  
1/3 cup caster sugar  
Pinch of salt  

**Method**  
Step 1: Combine water, butter and essence in a large (1 cup capacity) coffee mug. Add remaining ingredients. Stir well to combine.


Step 2: Microwave on high for 60-75 seconds (using a 1100 watt microwave). 60 seconds results in a molten centre. 75 seconds will result in a more uniformly cooked brownie.

Step 3: Serve topped with vanilla ice-cream. Take care, as brownie will be hot and will continue to cook while standing."
