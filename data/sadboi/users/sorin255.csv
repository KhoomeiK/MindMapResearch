Ideally all ownership should be linked to use. Individual ownership is still possible, although more commonly we'd see collective ownership. Workers owning their workplaces, tenants owning the buildings they live in.

Even just today both of these are possible, since worker co-operatives and housing co-operatives exist, although the deck is stacked so in favour of the moneyed class that it's hard to get these off the ground.

How a housing co-operative would work today is that all tenants still pay ""rent"", but without the overhead of profit for a landlord and maybe even a mortgage, the rent would be much cheaper. It would just need to cover property tax, possibly utilities, and a building maintenance fund. A democratic council is organized to govern the building.

Take the Overton window away and look at the actual political compass and Bernie isn't actually that far left, and Biden and Trump are both technically right (with Trump much further right than Biden).

Applying this to the UK, the extremes of their Overton window are Corbyn and Thatcher with. Tony Blair would be centre compared to them, but expanding that window he'd still be closer to the right. Same goes for Canada.

Free healthcare is fantastic but doesn't fix every inequality, unfortunately.

While you can get checked out for most things (there's some stuff in my home province in Canada that isn't covered anymore because austerity), being poor still affects whether you even have time to go to the doctor, whether you can afford to miss work for treatment, whether you can afford treatment (because drugs are still costly.) You don't go bankrupt for breaking a leg but you're still screwed over by everything else.

On top of that free healthcare is purposefully underfunded, both as austerity measures, and in attempts to undermine it. Underfunding creates the inefficiencies conservatives can point to and go ""hey private works better.""

Going from Saskatoon to Prince Albert you go from prairie to forest in an hour's drive and it's a fun transition.

And this sky is with you the whole time."

Also if people think this is pretty, skies here are even prettier when you're on the lake. Especially up north around the Lac La Ronge provincial park."

I mean, Leif Erikson's crew came to North America before any other European and archaeological evidence suggests they had a positive relationship with the indigenous people. Rest of the Europeans come over and genocide happens."
marvelstudios,fmyo4wn,t1_fmy50rw,1586491000.0,"I mean, it's movie execs. And not just any movie execs; Paramount movie execs. If those guys look at Benedict Cumberbatch and think ""yeah go ahead and cast him as a middle eastern villain, JJ"" or read the Romeo and Juliet law thing in that one Transformers movie (they all blurred together after awhile) and thought that was okay... I have no problem believing they gave the okay to that disastrous Sonic.

If rumours are true some execs on the movie even wanted Sonic looking that way and purposefully stayed away from a more faithful look."
antiwork,fmynb2k,t1_fmymmzi,1586490391.0,From what I understand about mental illness and emotions and stuff it must have been a thing. I don't even think it's over diagnosed though. It's just another symptom of late stage capitalism - people no longer sated by the bread and circuses but hopeless about any chance to get more.
LeftistGamersUnion,fmxqslv,t3_fxtbah,1586470073.0,I wonder who came to video games as a potential recruitment tool first. The army or neo-nazis...
DaystromInstitute,fmxmaok,t1_fmwrn2j,1586467657.0,"Actually hearing your post I'm almost convinced it wasn't even an objective to begin with, it was an attempt to adapt to the situation they found themselves in.

The sphere has the Enterprise in pursuit, it tries to jump to Transwarp to escape, but either the drive fails spectacularly or some phenomenon throws them into the past. They analyze their databases and bombard Montana because if Zefram Cochrane can't make his warp flight he can't attract the Vulcans. Minimum damage to the timeline, and they can engage the other Federation founders on their terms.

If the Enterprise hasn't shown up they would've also had their interplexing beacon set up to communicate with the Borg of the past, but it did, and it destroyed them, predictable enough that they can get onto the Enterprise undetected.

Adapting to snag after snag until Data finally hits them with warp core coolant, which they literally can't adapt to."
antiwork,fmxk8qh,t1_fmx388p,1586466557.0,"The weird thing is trying to figure out where mental health problems end and rational frustration with a broken system begins.

Like I know my depression is caused primarily by my mental disorder, but I'm sure at some point I'll be done dealing with my mental disorder and my depression will just be from the stress of capitalism and the only reason I'll still be treated is so I can meet capitalist standards. (Sometimes I wonder if I'm at that point now. Then shit happens and I'm reminded that I am actually broken.)

**Edit:** done in the sense that it's manageable and hopefully won't relapse"
