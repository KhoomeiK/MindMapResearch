ptsd,ezn1oau,t1_ezhpkts,1567999726.0,"I definitely understand that concern. I would suggest meeting with a therapist and doing pretty much what you've done here: describe what happened, describe your symptoms, and let them know you want help. If your therapist doesn't mention anything about a diagnosis after a few sessions, you can ask them about it. ""To me it seems like I have a lot of symptoms that line up with PTSD. What do you think?"" Or whatever phrasing feels comfortable to you. 

My therapist and I never talked about diagnoses (we talked a lot about my experiences, my symptoms, and how to manage them). But when I started seeing a psychiatrist, he diagnosed me with PTSD almost immediately. I asked my therapist what she thought about it, and I told her I always thought my main issues were depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks, with maybe a bit of underlying PTSD. She told me she feels PTSD is my main issue and that most of my other symptoms stem from that. I was shocked at first. But I've been working with her for a long time and I trusted her more than the psychiatrist who I had just met. The more I've been able to accept my diagnosis, the more progress I feel I've been able to make.

It's reasonable for you to want to figure out what diagnosis matches up with your symptoms. Some counselors tend to avoid talking about diagnoses or ""labeling"" things, but I've personally found it to be important. The more research I do on PTSD, and the more I read about other people's experiences (here and elsewhere), the better I understand what's going on with me. I know this may not be the same for everyone. Whether you decide to directly ask about PTSD or not, I would definitely recommend taking to a counselor about your experiences."

Edit: a word"
ptsd,ezcxvmd,t3_d0p6vh,1567842120.0,"I have this all the time. I do get nightmares and panic attacks at night but I really don't think that's why I experience this feeling. As others have said, I think it's related to feeling vulnerable while asleep. The hypervigilance/fight or flight aspects of PTSD make it so we want to avoid vulnerability and maintain our alertness. 

For years I have done mindless things on the web until I can't keep my eyes open anymore. It's almost impossible for me to fall asleep ""naturally"" with just turning off the lights and closing my eyes. I take medication now to help with the nightmares and nighttime panic attacks, and it also helps me fall asleep. But sometimes if I'm amped enough, I will even fight the meds and delay sleep. At those times, I really notice it as an issue because I feel afraid of falling asleep even when I have intentionally taken meds for this exact purpose. 

I sleep with a nightlight in my room and find sleeping during the day much easier comparitively. It's still a struggle to shut my thoughts up enough to fall asleep, but I usually don't have that same feeling of fear.

Reading about everyone's experiences on this post reminded me that I have had this issue to some extent since I was at least 16, maybe younger. It's interesting to realize I've been having symptoms longer than I realized before they became full-blown. Feeling kinda sad for my child self, but that's mostly a good thing because my default tends to be anger/criticism toward myself when it comes to my traumas and trauma responses. I'm able to feel a little bit of compassion toward my younger self right now.

ptsd,eyt35o2,t3_cyj9jp,1567422815.0,"The ""main"" trauma related to my PTSD happened when I was 10-14 years old. I started regaining memories of the trauma when I was 17 and developed full blown PTSD symptoms when I was 19. Diagnosed this year, age 27. 

Prior to that I was diagnosed with depression and ""anxiety NOS"" by a family doctor. For a long time I thought I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder with panic attacks. 

My treatment has consisted of outpatient counseling and some psychiatric medications (an antidepressant, an anti-anxiety med, and a med that helps with PTSD-related sleep issues). Eventually I plan to try EMDR therapy. 

As for why it may not have bothered you until now, I've heard that our brains can suppress things as a coping mechanism/survival skill. My counselor told me that I likely started having symptoms when I did because my brain decided I was ""safe"" enough to start processing the trauma (I was an adult, I had moved away to college and put a lot of physical distance between myself and my abuser, etc). 

The ""it wasn't that bad"" mentality seems to be extremely common among those of us with PTSD. I think minimizing our own experiences is part of the coping process. If we tell ourselves over and over again that ""it wasn't that bad,"" it makes it easier to get through it. But I think breaking through that is important to truly healing. Otherwise, I think we keep suppressing and stay stuck in survival mode. I'm still struggling with this myself and often get angry with myself about how much my experiences have affected me when ""they weren't even that bad.""

What you went through was traumatic. It's okay for you to be reacting to your trauma. Please be kind and patient with yourself as often as you can. I know that can be a challenge. Another way to think about it is this: What would you say if a friend told you this happened to them? (I'm willing to bet you wouldn't tell them, ""It wasn't that bad."") If you can see your experiences from outside yourself as much you can, it can be easier to be more objective.

You mentioned your outpatient program is ending. Are you able to get it extended at all? Or join a new program afterward? It sounds like you just recently figured out the ""root"" of things and need more time to actually process that with a therapist. I would also suggest looking into seeing a psychiatrist, if you haven't already. Meds have been helpful with reducing some of my symptoms."

ptsd,ey5092m,t3_cglnw1,1566816937.0,"I relate to this so much. My two year anniversary is coming up of when a (former) friend made unwanted sexual advances, and I've been struggling more and more the closer it gets. I did something similar recently and went into my archived Facebook messages and read through alllll of our messages from the day after it happened up until I finally confronted him about it and told him I wanted to go no-contact. It triggered the hell out of me and I just SPIRALLED. I ended up unblocking him so I could creep on his profile and try to see if he's made any public posts or posted any pictures. (I couldn't see a single thing other than his profile picture and cover photo, so it was 100% pointless). Then I got paranoid that he would somehow find out I'd unblocked him before I could block him again (had to wait 48 hrs). Then I took it ANOTHER step further and creeped on his ex's page too (she was his girlfriend at the time he pulled this shit with me). I had the same reaction to myself, like, ""WTF is wrong with me?!?""

My advice would be to be gentle with yourself and treat yourself with compassion and patience as much as you can. Anniversaries are hard, and two years really isn't that long when you're healing from something as traumatic as what you went through. Overall it sounds like you're making progress with your healing.

I never had road rage before my accident and it's like what you described - I'll be totally fine one second and then totally filled with rage. Like you, mine generally stays internalized. I don't act confrontational to other drivers, but sometimes I get a strong urge to ""act out,"" and that's really scary for me. I don't really have any advice on how to manage it. For me, I just remind myself of the things you've mentioned - the anger is actually a manifestation of anxiety/stress - and try to just remind myself that it will pass. Same with reminding myself I'm not actually as asshole, I'm just a person who was traumatized. Keep giving yourself those messages and keep treating yourself with compassion and patience, even if it doesn't feel like it's helping. The more we can reinforce those messages for ourselves and avoid negative self-talk, the more it will help in the long term. My only other suggestion would be talking about it with a therapist (if you haven't before). It's definitely a difficult symptom to deal with, and I hope it will get better for you soon!"
ptsd,exr6ipl,t1_exq8fob,1566511956.0,"For me, I had issues with heart palpitations. I'm sensitive to a lot of medications though. Lots of people are able to tolerate Prazosin without issue."
ptsd,exr69e6,t1_exo4u5c,1566511830.0,"I totally understand the fear of being invalidated! I would also be very surprised if that was the outcome. If your therapist is a good one, they will take your symptoms seriously whether or not you met criteria for PSTD. And if your therapist says they don't think it's PTSD but your gut is telling you otherwise, you can always get a second opinion. 

As for how to approach it with your therapist, I would start with just having an in depth conversation with them about the symptoms you're having and see what they say. If they don't mention anything about PTSD or any other diagnosis, I think it would totally fine to say, ""I think it might be PTSD. What do you think?"" 

My counselor and I never talked about diagnoses for a really long time and focused on symptom management. One day I decided to bring it up and I told her I felt like GAD was my main issue and depression was secondary. I asked what she thought, and she said she felt PTSD was my primary and the root of most of my anxiety issues. At the time, that was shocking to me because I felt the traumas I had been discussing weren't ""bad enough"" to cause PTSD.

Good luck with everything! It's okay to be nervous. I'm glad you're seeking support and are able to actively look into what's going on with you and what to do about it. That's not easy, but it's so important."
ptsd,exnxjlg,t3_ctjs7b,1566465758.0,"I have PTSD from at least three separate traumas in my life, possibly more. As others have said, I would continue exploring this with your counselor and work on figuring out a correct diagnosis. I would also suggest doing some research on C-PSTD. 

I also want to second what others have said and say, it is very common for people who have PTSD to minimize their experiences and believe they ""shouldn't"" have PTSD, even when they meet the criteria. I've heard it referred to as almost an ""imposter syndrome."" 

Whether or not you end up being diagnosed with PTSD, you have survived some serious trauma and your experiences are valid."
ptsd,exnwhim,t3_ctlbi2,1566465031.0,"Clonidine helps me fall asleep and generally seems to make my nightmares less intense most of the time. I hardly ever wake up with panic attacks or night sweats anymore. I still wake up a lot for short periods of time though and don't feel rested in the morning. Falling asleep in particular is much easier. I usually browse Reddit on my phone until I can't keep my eyes open anymore. 

Before Clonidine I tried Prazosin which probably would have ended up being more helpful for me but I couldn't tolerate the side effects when we were still doing dosage increases.

I hope you can find something that will work well for you! Insomnia is no joke."

I get the same feeling you described - feeling like a scared kid again. 

I also get triggered by a couple of songs and TV shows from my childhood that were associated with my trauma, so I can relate a bit to that aspect as well."

Do you think we could sick to lighter topics?"" Or something similar? If not, would you maybe be more comfortable bringing it up with your supervisor in private? Not in an ""I'm trying to get these people in trouble"" way, but just an ""I'm experiencing this and I need some help figuring out how to handle it"" way. The supervisor may be able to address it with the others in a less awkward way, and in a way that might not directly involve you."

It really does seem so unfair for our birthdays to be affected this way. For my situation, I have half-joked with my counselor, ""Couldn't he have picked some other day to be a dick?!"" I have hopes I can 'reclaim' my birthday with time, but doesn't look like it will be this year. Sorry to hear you're going through something similar. It does help to know I'm not alone though."
ptsd,ewu828x,t3_cpqfs0,1565768667.0,"I can relate! I'm very uncomfortable with anyone other than my SO touching me. I don't tolerate it well from even my parents or other family members. I get anxious when I know hugging will be expected for ""casual hellos,"" and wish that it was more socially acceptable to just not. With the ""hello/goodbye"" casual hugs I will either push through and try to pep talk myself (this is okay, it will only be a second, this person isn't going to hurt me, I can keep myself safe, etc), or in some situations I choose to just avoid it and risk the possibility of seeming rude. At those times I have to try to give myself permission to make my boundaries a priority. In a lot of situations, people will read my body language correctly and not try to hug me, and I will just do friendly verbal hello/goodbyes instead. 

I don't think I've tried this or had to do this before, but you could also try being really upfront about it and telling people something like, ""It has nothing to do with you at all but I just really don't like being touched."" Hopefully whoever you are talking to will be mature enough to respect your boundaries without taking it personally. 

On the other hand, if you'd rather try to increase your tolerance, maybe you could try ""exposure therapy"" in a sense by ""practicing"" hugging and other physical affection more regularly with someone who feels safe (maybe a close friend). You could either have a discussion with that person and let them know you are trying to build up your tolerance and would like to ""practice"" with them, or you could just keep it to yourself and give yourself mindful, intentional reminders when exchanging physical affection with that person (this is a safe person, I am safe, this person cares about me, I want to be able to show physical affection to this person). This might also work better if you choose to initiate the affection more often, so you would be more in control versus maybe feeling more ""on guard"" or ""defensive"" if the other person initiates.

I'm glad it was so helpful for you previously!

I definitely understand not wanting to get into that particular trauma with the other therapist. Because of my trauma history, I don't feel comfortable having males as therapists in general. For the intake appointment I went to in my original post, I actually went to a different city about 30 miles away because there were no female counselors available for EMDR at local center that takes my insurance.

I've found my symptoms have gotten worse the deeper I've been able to acknowledge and try to work through my trauma. I first started talking about my main incident several years ago too, but I think I was only able to access it and process it at a fairly surface level at that point. Not sure if the reasoning is something similar for you, but I think for some people it's pretty normal for symptoms to get worse even after a long period of time.

I think now that I'm officially diagnosed, it has sort of forced me to acknowledge that what I went through was traumatic. For years I have been telling myself ""it wasn't that bad,"" ""it could have been way worse,"" ""it doesn't make sense for it to be affecting me like this,"" etc. Now I feel like I'm finally taking it a little more seriously. I feel like I'm able to better focus on healing the more I'm able to ""suspend my disbelief"" that what I experienced was traumatic."
Anxiety,ewnzbsx,t1_ewlx6kh,1565597876.0,"Thanks for the suggestions. My psychiatrist has talked about trazadone and hydroxyzine as options before. I think I will probably try trazadone next if I end up switching again, because my mom has bad insomnia too and says that's one of the only meds that's ever helped her.

Previous antidepressants I've taken were citolopram (Celexa) and fluoxetine (Prozac). I stopped talking the citolopram after only a few weeks because the side effects were too much. The Prozac I took for awhile but then started to feel like it wasn't really helping anymore. When I tried to do a dosage increase, I couldn't tolerate the side effects. I stayed in bed for two days straight, didn't want to get up to eat, had increased depression symptoms, etc. I think I stayed on the dose I had been on for awhile and then eventually transitioned off.

Now I'm talking duloxetine (Cymbalta). This was originally prescribed to me by a family doctor, and now that I started seeing a psychiatrist, I found out the dosage I've been taking for years is not high enough to be effective for treating depression and anxiety. I actually started seeing this psychiatrist to help me get off the Cymbalta because I felt like it wasn't doing anything for me, but it makes me really sick if I accidentally miss a dose. After awhile I finally took my psychiatrist's advice to try increasing the dose instead. After about a month on the increased dose, I do think it has helped with my depression symptoms (haven't noticed much change with the anxiety).

Before working with the psychiatrist, I tried a couple of over the counter meds for sleep. Benadryl really didn't do much for me. I was taking 6 mg of Melatonin for awhile, which helps me fall asleep but doesn't help me stay asleep (I wake up a ton during the night). With the psychiatrist, I've tried Prazosin which was more helpful than anything I've tried before, but when doing increases to get to the recommended dose, I was having heart palpitations that would leave me short of breath and clutching at my chest from things like walking up the stairs or standing up too fast. I stayed on Prasosin for a couple of months but the side effects didn't get better, so he switched me to Clonidine. The Clonidine helps me fall asleep but again I'm still waking up over and over throughout the night. I think I might not be waking up as fully as before but I'm still not getting restful sleep. He wants to get me up to 0.4 mg nightly, and so far I'm up to 0.3 mg. At 0.3 mg I'm having some heart palpitations and dizziness, but to a lower degree than with the Prazosin and usually only when I first get up in the morning. I suspect if I increase to 0.4 mg, the side effects will increase more than the benefits. I also take buspirone (Buspar) at night, which doesn't make me sleepy but helps with my anxiety and slows my racing thoughts down (sort of ""quiets my brain"") so it's easier to fall asleep."
ptsd,ewgktl8,t3_co1g78,1565384113.0,"It still sounds like a PTSD nightmare to me, even if you aren't ""reliving"" the event, per se. Some of the components of your trauma are still present in the nightmare (fear, anxiety, anger (?), etc). Dreams are a way our brains try to process things, and it sounds like this is your subconscious trying to work out your trauma. The ""tracking and stalking"" type dreams also sound super normal to me. This is an expression of your negative feelings toward your abuser, and could also be a way of your brain trying to help you take back some control. 

Also, just wanted to say that having this type of symptom over a year after a traumatic event is not unusual. I know it can definitely feel like it, but a year really isn't that long when you're recovering from major events like what happened to you. So try to avoid giving yourself any negative messages like, ""Why is this taking so long??"" or, ""I should be over this by now!"" Make sure to treat yourself with compassion and patience. Although it's super unpleasant to be having these symptoms, you're allowed to still be healing."

The second med is less helpful than the first even though I've done two dosage increases since starting it. I'm also having side effects from the newer one but they seem tolerable so far. Frustrating to even have side effects though when the med isn't helping nearly as much as I'd like. I don't know if the pros and cons balance out. Sometimes I feel ready to give up on meds, too. But, I also still think there could be the right combo out there that could help me. I don't really have any advice right now, just wanted to let you know I can relate."
