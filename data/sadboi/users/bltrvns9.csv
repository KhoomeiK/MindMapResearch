Adulting,fqg4prn,t1_fqfzs5e,1589337930.0,"Yeah, the part time work is the only thing holding me back from saying go for it. FT is more stable and I‚Äôd want that before taking on extra costs that carry legal ramifications like a mortgage."
weddingplanning,fqg4kbm,t3_gijhoh,1589337839.0,"I am divorced and before my first wedding I had doubts. Little ones, not even something that seems very serious like what you‚Äôve described. I wish I had just confronted those feelings head on and called it off. Sure, I would‚Äôve lost deposit money and it‚Äôs a little embarrassing (even though it shouldn‚Äôt be) but it‚Äôs nothing like an actual divorce. The entire wedding went on so the cost was a LOT more than just deposits. The awkwardness afterward when people would ask how‚Äôs husband? The being broke and getting my own apartment where I really couldn‚Äôt even afford cable or internet. If you have an issue now, I know it‚Äôs SO hard, but now is the time to address it and take action."
simpleliving,fqg45ao,t3_gipeyb,1589337587.0,Saying no to events I don‚Äôt really want to go to. That‚Äôs my biggest one and the biggest positive change in my life since I implemented it.

running,fqfluqi,t3_gil91k,1589327237.0,"Objectively speaking - yes allergies can really affect you. I had a high schooler in a training group of mine that really struggled because of them. Once she got a handle on them her running improved a lot. 

But yeah, it could be a lot of things so your best bet is to see your doctor."
