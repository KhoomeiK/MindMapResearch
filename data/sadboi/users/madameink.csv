(sorry, I'm not optimistic that capitalism is gonna change some day, but thats a personal view)

Depression is something that literally dont let you to even leave your bed, how can someone change their living condition if you have literally no energy to even brush your teeth or even doing the things you love most? If you cant maintain in time a life project or a job when you're feeling a little better (because the depression without treatment always kicks in again, EVEN if the person is having a good life.

This makes me feel that you see depression as something simpler than what it really is. There are more symtoms than sadness , a lot more.

Hi! I think that that is a major issue. But I also think that if you dont have a way to soon leave that situation you can do something about it going maybe to a psychologist first and if that aproach doesnt work then to a psychiatrist. But if you go do it with a critic perspective, ask how that professional thinks that what they give you will help, ask about side effects or investigate them for yourself so you can do the most informed desition posible. Some times medication is necesary to give you a ""boost"" to feeling better and start searching for the core of the problem and eventualy find the solution to that and (maybe) leave the meds (always with caution). 

Again, the main problem can be your enviroment but you dont have to suffer all the time until you can go out that place (that I think is difficult for some reason, I understand that, other way you would already have done it).

Thats just the way I see it in my experience (of seeing a bad part of psychiatry but also a helpful one). Be critic and dont settle on only one opinion just because ""the doctor is the one who knows"". You know things too."

I'm interested in that because I dedicate myself to study bipolar disorder (in an informal way, I'm a person who has it and I'm interested in knowing the more I can to contribute giving information to society giving talks in some institutions, I've been doing it for some years).

The thing is that I try to read all sides about that, even the ones that denies a lot of things regarding the bio part, and the neuroplasticity I think is what make the real conection between social an psychological and the brain as an organ. But I want to try to understand that better to explain it better if I'm in the right path about that (or learning if I'm not)."
Antipsychiatry,fo7wjpb,t1_fo5ljlj,1587585762.0,">Being odd or strange is not an illness or a crime.

I have a question, **where would be the difference between someone ""being odd"" and someone who really has a problem that is not a personality trade?** 

I tell you why I say this for context. I have bipolar disoder. I really consider after studying this a lot that it explains what I felt and lived for years, and after the diagnosis I had access to a ton of tools (mostly that I found myself because I'm very self-taught, the proffesionals should have give them to me but that unfortunaly doesnt happen and I disagree with how the doctors dont work in a more deep way) and one of those tools made me see that my personality, who I am and how I usually behave is not ""what I do"" when I'm having what is called an episode. I'm a person who can save money, not a person that spends money I dont have buying stupid things (that only happened before treatment, after it never happened again), spending like that is not being odd, is creating a serious financial problem. I'm a solitary and cold person, to some people that yes, may be odd, okay, but when in depression I completery isolate from even the people I love, that I wouldnt think is just odd, that is bad, is loosing moments with people that would never be back. Or for example I can be sad and create art from that, maybe thats odd, but in some point even nice, but being EXTREME sad (depression) and not being even able not only of doing art but also not being able to eat or shawer is not odd, is a big problem."
Antipsychiatry,fo7rerb,t3_g5fm23,1587583249.0,"I'll tell you what I felt some months ago after hearing something like that for the first time: invalidated. My whole suffering invalidated. Because I thought ""if bipolar disorder doesnt exist then I'm just a stupid person that cant deal with her problems"" (since I went to therapy and I had a good enviroment). I also felt so guilty for not being able to do simple mundane things like eating or showering, or being thankfull for all the good I had on my life,  and then concept of mental illness not being what explained that made me feel much more guilty. I think because the line between saying ""mental illness doesnt exist"" and ""you're just a lazy person that dont know how to live"" is so thin that is easier to confuse. Thats whyI think it feels like an personal attack.  


But now I see it differently. I see that specially the institutions do more harm than good (by speaking with other people because I got really interested about this subject but I've never been hospitalized), I also think there are a ton of missdiagnosis, people medicated that shouldnt be medicated, and a lot of things going wrong in the health system. Thats awful and I'm trying to find forms to colaborate in inform about this things to people.

About me specifically, I consider I really have the series of symptoms for what is named (now) bipolar disorder. After receiving the diagnosis a lot of years of my life gained meaning and an explanation. I started to being able to put name to a lot of things that I lived and didnt make sense before the diagnosis. Also I could see in my photos (I'm a photographer and my states showed in my creative process, I was crazy to find years later that what appeared in my work had actually names)  And I was exausted (REALLY exausted) and knowing that what happen to me has a name aaaand a treatment was a SO BIG relief. I needed a relief and rest a bit at that point of my life.   
(That didnt came straigh foward, I went first psychologists, and to another psychiatric who diagnosed me wrong and gave me an antidepressant that gave me withdrawal symptoms and took me a year to taper from). But that was my experience,  that yes, was good, and after receiving the medication for bipolar, tapering from the poison of that antidepressant and going to therapy and a good enviroment my life began to be mine again, because thats the thing with this kind of suffering, you loose the control of your life. I dont trade this stability I achieve (by a lot of factors but medication at least to start was a part) for anything.

I thought when I found this group that there were gonna be only people mad saying nonsense driven only by emotion. And I get it, I was mad when I discovered the poison of that antidepressant. But actually I found really interesting concepts and views of seeing things, and a respect for what each individual decides to do. For me (regarding medication) I'll still take it (they are small doses) because right now I dont want to risk falling into depression again (or withdrawal if the ones I take now causes it, I dont know), but surely I would be critic about other situations that comes to me in the future regardless psychiatry. I think diagnosis (well given) are a way to start to work in the person well-being, but also consider crucial that the patient HAS to have a voice and autority in what is given to them.
