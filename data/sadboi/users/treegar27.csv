Its  been over a year but it  took months and months for oil production to slow down.  I can now leave my hair down for 2-3 days but have to start putting it up after that which has been somewhat of a blessing.  I used to hate putting my hair up but now I almost prefer it that way and is faster for me in the morning.  I have fine thin hair and while it appeared healthy before, hairdressers always complimented my hair and said it felt so healthy, it would get really thin at the shoulders if I tried to grow it out and so always kept it just above shoulder length.  But it's taken months and months of periods of annoyingly greasy hair for oil production to slow down.  I work from home alot orherwise the process would have been even slower."

So many people just aren't in the position mentally to be what is needed for those who are suffering.   It's so much to take on.  To ask someone to share the burden of depression is a lot.  In the end we really have to fight this ourselves and I'm not sure if this is a bad thing.  I have friends with depression that lean on family members too much and I think that sometimes it becomes a crutch that they can't/won't let go of.  

You can start the climb out.  It's so so very very hard I know... but you can.  Little things.  One little thing everyday that you would rather not do but you know is good for you.  Make it stupid easy so thats it's ridiculous if you can't complete it.  If you can't do it, then its not stupidly easy enough.  Even something as simple as a reply to someone else.  Good job, I see you, little comments can brighten someone's day.

We all have our past of regrets.  Its so easy to dwell on them too and not get sucked into that pain.  Do something good for someone.  Recreate the narrative and become a good person.  No, not overnight... this will be a daily battle.  Do good deeds even when you feel like a horrible person.  Little things, one good deed however small even if it's for yourself.  Little steps become big steps.  

I care and this community cares.  I'm so sorry you are suffering.  Depression sucks.  I'm going thru a tough time right now and its so hard not to get caught up in it."
