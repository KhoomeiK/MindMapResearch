Growing up I've been shaped into a shy person, leading me to stick to one particular friend group at each stage of my life. My circle is extremely small believe it or not. So my friends, they're xSFJs or xSFPs. They intimidate me lol so it's can be a little stressful at times. It's like our energy never matches lmao it's literally so devastating tbh anywayyy

But who knows, maybe it's just that I haven't got to meet an intj yet that's why friendships are hard! Also, thanks for sharing this hahaha I'm so happy for you!!! Before I forget! This inspires me to break out of my shell to show my real self! :)"

He straight up went to kids who appeared to be larger than him and started giving them a slight nudge. I think he was inviting them to join him lol. They pushed him and he fell on the ground:( This was caught on our family video. Until this day we still have a good laugh at it haha.

I'm an enfp with anxiety so I usually avoid social situations. But once I made it out of the house I feel great lol. 

Unless it's people that I really can't be bothered talking to, otherwise I would be really smiley when I meet new people (whom I'll consider rather comfortable with).

Some of my hi-bye friends must have thought that I'm flirting when I'm just being extra friendly. They don't excite me as much as new people so I'd be more reserved with them opposed to the new people lol. It could be that I'm just excited after not having social engagement for such a long time which leads to this over friendly thing? 

Every single time when I'm just being friendly, they really gave me that l👀k
