VirtualYoutubers,fr5ndtc,t3_gmtedy,1589911437.0,"Can't wait for her to get funds. I'd love to see how her set up changes over time. I'm usually super critical of how avatars look, but considering she wanted to be a vtuber so badly she just drew one up and did it all herself for over a year (?) It's downright admirable"
VirtualYoutubers,fr4v852,t3_gmogl4,1589897518.0,Already there! Can't get too relaxed though because I'll end up going to sleep lol
VirtualYoutubers,fr3ml96,t1_fr3m1ox,1589860774.0,"I'll check out that clip when I get more proficient in my Japanese language studies x.x

VirtualYoutubers,fqdrdpy,t3_gibwnk,1589295262.0,It was fun trying to help her with her dynamax pikachu hunt.
VirtualYoutubers,fqdkjq2,t3_gibbhm,1589291601.0,Wow she even found out about this one

Hololive,fp4owfv,t3_gb7h30,1588303849.0,"Whomp. While it's funny, I really hope someone explained to her later what that word entails."
VirtualYoutubers,fp4jazo,t3_gb9jgg,1588300292.0,"I have to say, her shouting about getting ""cleansed"" and breaking out into that song was hilarious to me"
VirtualYoutubers,fp4i1rs,t3_gav125,1588299507.0,I missed her stream because of work ;-;
Hololive,fozk8kc,t1_fozj9wk,1588192054.0,This must've been before I got into vtubers lol

Hololive,foz158j,t3_g9ysxq,1588182887.0,I'm straight lol don't picture it changing at any moment of my life.
VirtualYoutubers,foyvsss,t3_g9ywzk,1588180100.0,"Lol I can't speak for everyone else, but my reason for watching more jp indie vtubers as opposed to en indie vtubers is actually pretty petty.   
1. If the character model looks like ass, I won't watch. (So far from what I've seen, I haven't seen many en vtubers with models that I actually care for)  
2. A matter of personality. (I think others mentioned how some of them have that ""IT'S YA BOI/GURL ETCSOMETHINGORANOTHER COMING AT YOU...."" I hate that.  
I think that's about it for me. Also Katsumi, I like your model so I gave you a follow on twitter, youtube, and twitch lol.  
Actually this made me remember a 3rd reason. I discovered vtubers on youtube, so I haven't really been watching vtubers on twitch until recently."
VirtualYoutubers,fowhv3w,t1_fowcuhl,1588120082.0,Same. I'm assuming she saw me comment on one of the random independent vtubers I follow lol
VirtualYoutubers,fovxjy9,t3_g9ojw4,1588109278.0,Discovered her last night when she randomly started following my twitter with her english account lol she seems interesting so I'll watch her streams. I like her design

VirtualYoutubers,fnwlo9l,t1_fnwldn7,1587320768.0,She said she's actively studying English so she doesn't mind foreign viewers. Also I just found out today her favorite vtuber is Okayu! I can understand why because they both have a soothing voices imo lol
VirtualYoutubers,fnwkwby,t1_fnwkfrn,1587320340.0,Thank you! It did :-)

VirtualYoutubers,fnhdxui,t1_fngd28c,1586960554.0,Lol I actually got a ad about her about 15mins before her previous Undertale stream. Subscribed right away
VirtualYoutubers,fnefjfi,t3_g19izu,1586888464.0,I like her voice and she has a good design. Instant sub lol I look forward to her next stream
VirtualYoutubers,fncd5vw,t1_fnc99qc,1586833906.0,Damn! I wonder if she takes commissions lol I want her to draw a character for me!
VirtualYoutubers,fnc7rj5,t1_fnc6krs,1586830440.0,I'm curious as to who was the artist and illustrator for her design and live2d thing.
VirtualYoutubers,fnc3iaw,t3_g0vklm,1586827844.0,She has a neat design. I shall watch!

VirtualYoutubers,flhxxul,t3_fosudq,1585171587.0,I'm so happy for her. This was long overdue. She should have like 250k by now honestly lol
VirtualYoutubers,flez1a7,t3_fmxujx,1585094440.0,"Random question. Does Bell ever wear her hat? I've only caught like 3 or 4 of her streams and some collabs with Lily, but I have yet to see her in wear it"

VirtualYoutubers,fl1n36g,t1_fl1n1ty,1584732260.0,Also I highly recommend checking Prune out. She's really sweet.
VirtualYoutubers,fl1n1ty,t3_flww7x,1584732239.0,"Yea all the time. Since I'm still learning hiragana/katakana, I just use simple english phrases and most vtubers usually get the general idea. I've had comments read by most of the 4th generation of hololive. Aki Rosenthal has read some of my comments, but again I used very simple english. A lesser known vtuber named [Prune](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGhGLjOhmqfVWmq7AiugHyQ) basically no english skills...well she can read it but not understand a lot of what I say. I've ended up having full on conversations with her via google translate if she doesnt understand what I say. Sometimes she will even use google translate to understand what I say as well lol This only works because her viewer count is usually pretty small. (she only has a little over 500 subs)"
