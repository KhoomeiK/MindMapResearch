I worked for a mutual building society so never sold a bridging loan although I needed to know about them for my qualifications. The maximum loan would depend on your equity level and other assets you mentioned. The more equity, the more risk the lender is likely to accept.

todayilearned,ewrmmmj,t3_cpubim,1565709006.0,"This happened on the M6 motorway near me and the murder occurred in Fenton just up the road from my workplace. There are a number of inconsistencies with the case such as number of weapons used in the murder, and therefore number of killers, why one of the twins was released very shortly after being detained under the mental health act, why one of them screamed “they are going to take your organs” when arrested. 

Some evidence suggests they were already under police/intelligence observation before these incidents, possibly involved in some sort of smuggling operations. Some have even gone as far to suggest they were the result of a government cloning/eugenics programme. This would explain their apparent ‘shared psychosis’ and their lack of pain or hinderance after receiving considerable physical injuries in the M6 incident. One even continuing to resist arrest after allegedly committing the murder, jumping from a bridge, and breaking her legs.
