ShitMomGroupsSay,f7d0ysv,t1_f7d0kow,1573604814.0,"I genuinely wish science literacy had some emphasis in writing and science courses. I remember that it was part of the curriculum in a basic way (like learning the difference between accuracy and precision, limitations of sets, statistical inference) but even without adding a class specifically to address it I feel like the curriculum could do more for this. It's increasingly important to be a skeptic. The more sure someone sounds about something, the more likely it is they are missing part of the picture.

Sorry you're having to deal with transphobia. The fact that research is relatively new isn't helping any; there aren't decades of ""this journal is the most rigorous"" or ""this model gets the most meaningful data"" for something that is still developing as a study-able interest. And it's your life!"
namenerds,f7cs7js,t1_f7c88bc,1573598847.0,"It's simple etymology from Greek: X is close to the letter pronounced ""chi"" in Greek, and was the first letter of Christos (Χριστός ). 

Historically, it has actually been used that way for names before, but that was 1) back in the 1700s; 2) for a female name (Christine, as Xene).

In other words, good luck to this kid."

They coat their words in a thin veneer of legitimacy by citing publications they haven't read more than the abstract of, and that poorly. Most people who are willing to find that person credible don't bother to check sources, and those that do don't read any more than the abstract, either. And because science literacy is grossly under-taught, none of the words make sense unless they're put in a social context they have no business being in.

So, yeah, fuck faux science reporters."

There is goddamn plenty of things like chicken pox and measles can do to you (or, let’s be real, the very young and very old or immunocompromised) short of death, including contributing to death.

The flu itself is not really monitored for deaths in the US other than for children, so the CDC estimates flu deaths through complications, like pneumonia.

There's also less ability to deal with it individually if you live urban, so when your entire block including your apartment/townhouse/condo goes dark, you've got nothing to do except hope you charged your devices and turn on some flashlights.

Sorry, I did misread regarding mortality in a very alarming way. It was 10% of all deaths that were attributed to pneumonia & influenza, not 10% of all cases of pneumonia & influenza causing death.

> During the 2017-2018 season, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was at or above the epidemic threshold for 16 consecutive weeks. During the past five seasons, the average number of weeks this indicator was above threshold was 11 (range of 7 to 15 weeks). Nationally, mortality attributed to P&I exceeded 10.0% for four consecutive weeks, peaking at 10.8% during the week ending January 20, 2018. 

But the child statistic was real:

> As of April 19, 2019, a total of 186 pediatric deaths had been reported to CDC during the 2017-2018 season. This number exceeds the previously highest number of flu-associated deaths in children reported during a regular flu season (171 during the 2012-2013 season). **Approximately 80% of these deaths occurred in children who had not received a flu vaccination this season.**"
