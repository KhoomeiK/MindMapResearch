I have literally never been trained on a job that wasn't a students job. I have a degree and I'm supposed to use what I learned in University. If OP is positive she must have lied in her resume, the company either wants a certain academic degree or a certain degree of experience specifically so they don't have to train anyone. My partner works in accounting and almost all employers require x years of experience because they won't train anyone to do their job properly. 

Your suggested course of action would have been the professional route however it also would have immediately led to the girl being fired. Accusation she can not properly put reason behind (therefore false) + incompetence (there would be no way around admitting that in said meeting) = fired. OP gave her a chance at keeping her job by keeping it unprofessional. 

I think the people here are kind of naive. From the OP it sounds as if the company was rather smallish. Do you think no one would ask questions when OP would suddenly refuse to help the new girl after mentoring her for a week? He probably should have waited for someone to ask what's up, but her getting on bad terms with everyone else was a matter of time. I too don't really buy into OP seeking reassurance by his coworkers but honestly having been the victim of a false sexual harassment accusation, that's not a situation you want to be in and social retaliation is fair game to me.

I've had adult family members who had difficulties with their teeth and had to had them removed. Imagine the agony they've been through. It would just be a preventive procedure. It's your right to not remove your kids teeth but it is my right to remove the teeth of mine. 

Circumcision does in fact affect functionality. I'm speaking from experience here. Due to actual medical reasons I was circumcised as an adult. I had sex with and (obviously nowadays) without a foreskin and it's a vastly different experience. I was unlucky enough to get psoriasis almost exclusively on my foreskin so overall my situation has improved but if I just could have a foreskin without my disease, I wouldn't give cutting it off a second thought at all. The procedure per se is extremely uneventful. My braces gave me a harder time. I guess that at least, maybe I was more sensitive as a teen than as an adult man. So I don't believe a word of the ""agony"" they went through. In Asia, Australia, Europe and South America circumcision is and was mostly done in cases of phimosis. These past procedures are nowadays seen critically because most cases of phimosis are curable without the procedure. Even men who do have problems don't necessarily have to be circumcised. 

The foreskin contains nerveends and removing it leads to the glands desensitizing. You're actively limiting your sons sexual pleasure for all his life because he could potentially get complications (what isn't a high probability to begin with) and would have to get an uneventful medical procedure at older age. This feeling of entitlement of yours is absolutely disgusting. You feel entitled to permanently alter your child's body. Cutting a part of your sons body off is not your right. It's also insane that one of your arguments is that they won't remember. That's part of why it's so disgusting. They can't object. But theyll never know what they're missing out on so I guess it's okay then."

There's no valid reason to permanently mutilate your son if he doesn't have a medical condition that requires it. The foreskin is not just some spare piece of skin. 

Basic human decency is not mutilating infants who are unable to protect themselves. The American practice of obligatory circumcision is the single most backwards tradition in all of the Western world. Even fucking Bull Racing isn't that disgusting as you're supposed to feel a special sense of protection for your child and not some deranged need to mutilate them because you/your father/the holy Ghost has also been unnecessarily mutilated by their parents (who probably weren't shitty as information wasn't so easily accessible then). 

Do you also respect African cultures which mutilate their daughters? Would you respect a culture that bashed their kids teeth out because they can't be arsed to teach them how to clean them?

However since you said the party could be held at your house I guess you'd be fine with a reasonably large party. Either way, as of now it's you being sad over not getting a party at all so the cost doesn't matter. If it were abt it I'd say you're being immature abt it. 

You made it clear you want this, you reminded him and he decided to not give a shit. You're perfectly fine for being upset. 

However I think the reaction you chose is kinda odd to me. You're currently not speaking to him and told him you're going to resent him extremely for that. I know there's two opinions whether it's a valid action for grownups to resort to ignoring so I'm not going to address that. But what about the resenting? did you tell him that so he gets the chance to correct his mistake? This thing is done. He's shown you he doesn't care. You aren't going to be satisfied with a party from him now. And you're also not going to get it. He's not going to realize how shitty he behaved, if anything he let's you ""get your way"". If this is as important to you as you make it seem, you should absolutely leave him over this. If you don't expect him to correct it, what was the point of telling him that? I'd have a hard time taking you serious too if you'd have told me you'd resent me for my misbehavior. If that's the case, why are you still there? Why would you chose to be with someone you resent? This is highly illogical and comes off as you throwing a fit. Hence his comment abt you getting over it. He doesn't take you seriously on that. 

I know it's easier to make that conclusion from the outside, but this ship has set sail. Either you deal with that disappointment by forgiving or you get out of that relationship if it's unforgivable to you. 

As for a solution now: since I agree that throwing yourself a party is kinda weird, how abt you hit your daughter and friends up to help you organize a party? Theyll be aware how badly you want that and they can do their best abt it. Funds may be difficult, but it's better to finance your own party than to not have one at all, no?"

But Avi and Min? Fuck that. That was a huge conflict that for some reason just didn't explode at all. They didn't know each other, they didn't like each other but they were totally fine with their man banging the other one. That's neither Aiel culture nor Min's belief in fate. The two instances in which they bonded were in no way enough to make that polygamous agreement believable.

Is your issue that he is close to his family at all or that he wasn't there for you at that specific day? I ask because you basically only explained how stupid his plan was (what I'd argue was intentional) and not what makes this a JustNo for you. Him wasting his own time is his problem.. What makes this yours?"

What family father spends his nights partying with his friends every week? That's insane. When does he interact with the kids? He comes from work and his buddies visit presumably very shortly after. He then has to sleep (duh) in the early morning like up to what? 12? Then he gets ready for work. He should get to sleep after his shift and spend time with the kids in the morning when he's working second shift. If it's any different and I misunderstood then please clear it up, but this seems as if you may as well be a single mom with child support and a bf visiting *you* 5 nights a week. The children then have no father"

Don't listen to all those in here projecting big time. 

You did not abandon your children. I find it Infuriating to call it that as it downplays when children actually get abandoned. If what you did is abandoning, what is what their stepfather did? 

Let's play it through where you move with your wife: you can't find work, thereby becoming absolutely dependent on the trust fund of your wife. Apparently giving yourself into dependency is required to be a decent parent as long as you're not female. 

Why your wife had to move there for good, we don't know and I don't think it's really important. Your marriage became incompatible, that sucks for everyone involved. Yet, I don't think it's reasonable to expect someone to drop all of their life so their partner gets their way. If I were a kid of someone like that and I learned my parent ended the life they worked hard for to accomplish for me, I'd feel nothing but guilt. Not more love or something, just guilt as that shouldn't be something anyone should be forced to do. 

Either way, you saw them approx 10-13 weeks a year. For an employed person living on the other side of the country this is far from deadbeat. Holy shit, how do you even come to that conclusion? ! That's 70-91 days. That's essentially having them at weekends. You weren't the same constant as such a father, but your wife decided to take your kids across half the country knowing your limited career opportunities. I don't really see how you could have had them a lot more than that without changing careers. 

Only seeing you between 50-100 days a year made them resent you so hard that they cut off all contact to you when they were adults?! That is insane. You being sad they took their stepdads name is understandable but them taking the name of the more present father figure is also understandable. Sometimes life is just sad. But you're not rejecting them for that but for cutting you off entirely essentially unprovoced. 

That being said: you should probably talk to them. I can imagine theyd be resentful when you let your wife leave with them, they were young and didn't understand. Later, when they understood, what any rational adult person should be able to, they couldn't just erase years of resentment with that knowledge. That's not how this works. You being mad abt them taking their present fathers name maybe added salt to that wound. Maybe it took a parent **actually** abandoning them to realize that what they did to you was wrong. You should hear them out. They're in the right age to actually have a genuine change of heart."
AmItheAsshole,fhwr74w,t1_fhueagy,1581926324.0,There's a huge difference between feeling distant and even enacting that distance and actively dropping someone like they did. He's blaming them for cutting all contact
