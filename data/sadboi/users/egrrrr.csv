TalkTherapy,fqzktr1,t1_fqzkh2q,1589769488.0,"well with your context it sounds less like they‚Äôre responding to what you‚Äôre doing/ trying to course correct you, and more like they‚Äôre becoming less reachable and less harmonious with how you expect/enjoy therapy to go"

remember there was a time when you Didn't know and trust your therapist, and you got to where you are now. yeah, it sucks to have to ""start over,"" but your therapist moving is out of your control. all you can do is cope with it and get back into taking care of your brain with someone else. you got this."
TalkTherapy,fqodou3,t3_gjy7ki,1589512923.0,"it sounds like your therapist is trying to express that they can't literally stop you from doing anything to yourself, and they'd like for you to use coping skills/ etc you've learned. kind of like they're pushing the baby bird out of the nest, because if you contact them/ rely on them, you won't learn how to do it yourself.

that said, it is a bit brusque of a style, so maybe comment on that.

I kind of coasted through college treating it like summer camp, taking classes i liked but not really deciding a thing I wanted to do after college. I wish I had taken advantage of the resources available to me in college to really hone in on something specific. so my advice to is to pick a thing. and it might change! mid-way through college, after working some years, etc. but you have to commit to something for at least right now.

if you don't even know where to start, maybe take a semester of classes that just interest you, and then reassess at the end-- ask yourself what you liked, what you didn't like. think about the jobs in the fields, etc."

I think the sales I used are gone now, but so many craft places are having online sales these days, just keep your eyes out for high density foam (this is 3"", I feel like anywhere between 2"" and 4"" is effective for these purposes) and vinyl to cover it with.

I'm a cis woman (26 years old) and I'm an ISTP (I used to test as a ISFJ about 6/7 years ago, but recently retested as I've been growing a lot in therapy). my hobbies lately are drawing (traditional and digital art), knitting (teaching myself), playing the lap dulcimer (also teaching myself), stubbornly taking on big projects involving things I know little about (i.e. printmaking, sewing clothes), pole dance classes, thrift shopping (I like hunting for treasures, clothes or otherwise). 

right now I'm frustrated with a job that doesn't give me enough responsibility/ freedom/ independence, and trying to reflect on myself to figure out what I do want to do for work. regardless, it's important for me to have things that I enjoy to do outside of work and lately I feel like I'm meeting up with my inner child again and remembering what non-""societally productive"" things make me happy.

the best thing to do is focus on your journey with your meds, don't look at horror stories too much. talk to your provider-- maybe 37.5 is good for you, or maybe you could be more than just ""content"". also, if you have anxiety, effexor really only works on that at 150 and up.
