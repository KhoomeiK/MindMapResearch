depression,fk3elr6,t3_fga544,1583829706.0,Look into Jungian shadow work. And meditation. By looking at these things and not running or distracting you will integrate them. Becoming more whole. There is no real normal.
depression,fk3edba,t3_fgabli,1583829374.0,That's a rut my friend. We've all been there. Dig yourself out slowly. Small changes n habits. Try daily meditation to start. It will help  reframing and becoming aware of what needs done. Patience with directed action. Weathers crap in Edinburgh too...

depression,fk26ofn,t3_ffzsch,1583794290.0,Your good at putting yourself down that's for sure. Imagine if you applied that to some other project
depression,fk26f5d,t3_ffy952,1583794135.0,What you do Is a choice. Happiness arises..or something else. We can appreciate it all ...and enjoy contentment. From which all things can arise

depression,fk06kvj,t1_fk06aff,1583744286.0,No just in general.before or whenever you get anxious.  Thing is...you don't control your thoughts. So thinking positively is an attempt at controlling thinking. Become aware of your breathing. Use it as an anchor. It's your safe place
depression,fk05ho7,t3_ffrk6s,1583742769.0,It's the same tool as any for life. Sit down and spend 10 mins following your breathing. Every time you get dragged along by thoughts then just focus on the breath. Meditation
depression,fk05chz,t3_ffrbch,1583742569.0,That's called growing my friend. If you've pushed people away and feel bad then try apologising and revealing how your feeling. Try to take responsibility for it all. I know it's hard. Meditation is worth doing daily
depression,fjx76e7,t3_ffaa8p,1583659972.0,Sit in hard chair back straight and fixed s on your breath. 20 mins a day

depression,fjx44wt,t3_ff9hyb,1583655840.0,And you clearly are smart. But that's only useful if you use it to become wise...were not made to sit watch TV. Set a goal. Even a small one. And realise the field of experience only seems limited. Think how open I really is though. That fear that's keeping you in this state is not permanent. But you must try to look at it and realise that you can make changes and learn how this mind and body works. Loving yourself is hard. But the more you get into dialogue with the body the more settled the mind will be. Meditation and exercise
depression,fjx3scn,t3_ff9hyb,1583655382.0,I felt like this for years. It was repressed childhood emotions. Unconscious. I started zen meditation...re read Jung and the great psychology stuff. I was suffering from anima possession...which a lot of people do..and through dreams and becoming more conscious and getting creative I was able to enjoy the challenge of balancing my opposites. The anima is your emotional feminine aspect but if we are not in touch with our gentle side we project it out into the world. Onto people and lovers. So look at what scares you. And take tiny steps each day toward those things. Exercise and meditation. Mindfulness is the door. Just walk through.
u_MikeC3694,fjx39xb,t3_f0p7o4,1583654716.0,Look into zen and meditation. It works
depression,fjx33b1,t3_ff9bqw,1583654482.0,Hate is an absence of love. Learn how to meditate. Get interested in your own psychology. Take responsibility for everything in you life. The pain you are in is a call to pick up burden of life and accept it. Your projecting your lack of self love. Go inward. You've nothing to lose
depression,fjx1vf2,t3_ff95fm,1583652979.0,Zen is fascinating as is the Tao te Ching. Check out actualised.org and the philosophers too...neitchze. zizek. Jordan peterson on Christianty...and look into Meditation. These things helped me too
awakened,fju8h12,t3_fex0cd,1583614671.0,I can't tell who is being ironic and who's delusional. And no zen devil better chuckle back at me. The best wisdom comes...in between posts..the gapsðŸ˜˜
Jung,fjr93sl,t1_fjr7tau,1583582835.0,Exactly. But we can also become inflated if we progress. By reaching out goal etc. It's nuanced
depression,fjqmd9j,t3_fet5h0,1583575044.0,Meditation
depression,fjqlgs6,t1_fjqj4yn,1583574629.0,You sound burned out. I feel for you. You've had a rough ride. Who was teaching you meditation and what type?
depression,fjqd2px,t3_fesemc,1583571330.0,You sound like me..before I discovered zen meditation and Jungian dream analysis. Daily meditation when you stick to it will allow you to cut through psychology. Sounds like you've unearthed some things during that time? I discovered a lot bout myself thru my training to be. Counselor
Jung,fjqchn2,t3_fef9j4,1583571034.0,And final thing. Don't become possessed by her. Embody the man in action and the anima in feeling
Jung,fjqc7u4,t1_fjp3jgh,1583570942.0,Welcome. Getting into discourses with the anima is a great thing. By being honest with your speech at work you are letting her out in a healthy way because dream analysis focuses on feeling. Women love to share their dreams. My colleague is my analysand. Just watch out for inflation as you find out a lot from people when they reveal their dreams.
depression,fjos9rz,t3_felfbu,1583533828.0,You sound articulate and bright. If I were you I'd start meditating daily. Best thing I ever started..
depression,fjop17p,t1_fjoirwc,1583532098.0,Hey man. I'm drinkin a cold IPA now..but it's Friday. I've been a help at work and go my shit done. Why? Cos it feels good. Ive still got a way to go. But I'm making small steps. Chalkin off that list dude. Its gradual but gets easier. We all have these moments. Finding your passion or talent in life is hard. But it's fun looking. Don't box yourself in mentally. It's a trap
depression,fjofxqt,t1_fjoerlc,1583526960.0,It's about perspective. That can change. Redemption is a real prospect for anyone. Modern life is rubbish. But go back to the old wisdom...Lao Tzu..Carl Jung..even.jesus. it's all myths we have lost in the modern age that deal with the question. You have strength that you are not able to see but have faith and try and make small steps. Tiny even. Human nature forgives. But we must become genuine. Honest and at strong. You have the time. There's only now. The rest is imagined. Mindfulness will bring you out of it.
depression,fjof4v8,t3_feic6v,1583526501.0,Wow your wise to get there so fast. That's called inflation my friend. It's ok. Some people are much older before they are so aware. Recognise it first. Admit that getting praise is nice. It's the repression of the feeling that makes you distressed. Don't be ashamed of it. Once you acknowledge it will lose that power. That's psychology...then to compensate perhaps do something you know your not good at. To balance those books. Be aware that good people are the ones who are aware of their dark side. Who know how petty they can be. Bad people just act that out. So get interested in your shadow. Look up jung
depression,fjoe7tg,t3_feiyog,1583525979.0,Look into Taoism and zen...your not alone. Because your not separate. It can seem impossible to improve sometimes but that's the power of the mind ..not reality. You can tame your attention so that it is free and not obsessive. Believe it or not it's true. The wonder of the world really is so close it's hard to see it unless we learn how to be free. Meditate.
depression,fjodksj,t3_feizai,1583525616.0,And some philosophers have dealt with the question. Why. Neitzhche..Tao te Ching...Alan Watts...check these people out. Meditation could be worth a try? Worked for me
depression,fjodbwl,t3_feizai,1583525474.0,You'll.end up.exactly where we all are. I red a book about this dilemma by a guy who survived aushwitZ. http://pcritchley2.wixsite.com/beingandplace/single-post/2018/08/28/Viktor-Frankl-and-the-Reasons-to-Choose-Life
depression,fjocr5w,t3_fej2cj,1583525144.0,Ok. Don't panic mfbomb..it's ok. Your a human being and our minds and bodies can turn this shit around. First thing is yes get counseling. I've on my 3rd period of counselling over 6 years. Everyone should be in counselling. Most people don have the balls. Do it. Second thing...be honest with the folks at work too. Own that shit. Apologies are needed less and less as.you.do.one you learn. My pop was an alcoholic...your young. You don't have to go through that. How? By the holy trinity...of.meditation. exercise and psychology. Meditation will calm your body first.then your mind will follow. Then exercise brings it all together. Some childhood stuff to deal with is normal. When stuff happens before we even know what we are it goes unconscious and causes emotions to be unpredictably painful. Good news is it's all been done. It's the hero's journey my friend. Love yourself and take care of yourself like you would someone you love

depression,fjl70xv,t1_fjl63wz,1583441159.0,But..the most important thing. And I'm not joking is this...your body influences your mind. Do you hear? You take care of the body and meditate. Your mind will be s friend rather than for. Work on mind too much and body suffers. That's yin n Yang. Look at balance
depression,fjl6kra,t1_fjl63wz,1583440910.0,Evolutionary biology is a cool thing. But we live in times of tech that were not quite ready for psychologically. You sound bright. Philosophy and religion have been taking excellent ground on these things for thousands of years. The best stuff is the oldest too. Existentialism is interesting stuff. Socrates. Neitzhche. These guys have done a lot of work on this
depression,fjl5o1b,t3_fe1iq7,1583440405.0,Yes you've imagined your life..lived it already. The solution is to become present. And stay there. Mindfulness meditation.
depression,fjl5hmp,t1_fjl4k2w,1583440307.0,Guess the quick answer is this regard ing the anima. Get in touch with your emotions and realise your anima is there...not in others. I would say your young though and it's not gonna be long before you get hooked up with someone. Even this discourse has an effect. It's your dreams that really help with this stuff. Get on r/jung
depression,fjkobg1,t1_fjknwjq,1583430682.0,Meditation daily ensures your always aware of your perspective...but that it doesn't color the world by tinting your lenses. Aware itself is the answer. Try some zen or vipassana meditation.
depression,fjkmxod,t3_fdyo9y,1583429927.0,It's a framing problem. You've backed yourself into a tiny space of your psyche and now convinced that's all there is. Meditate. Learn how and stick to it daily my friend

depression,fjki8fc,t3_fdy25b,1583427332.0,Yes. But it's necessary sometimes to let true friendship s rise to the top while others fall away.

depression,fji3oup,t3_fdjtn6,1583360084.0,Ok firsthing. Jordan peterson is useful but forget about status. Think about this. You look at some stage in a cave. He's been meditating for 5 years alone. He walks into a city. Low status right? Except he is enlightened. Do NOT judge yoursel on materialism. Of course get the basics sorted. Then look into psyche and meditation. I started early at 30. ðŸ˜˜
depression,fji0kcg,t3_fdk8gy,1583358495.0,Your mind has fooled you? You seem annoyed that your doing this to yourself? Make a list of all the things you're annoyed at missing out on.

Look into mindfulness.
depression,fjhzgr6,t3_fdc1i0,1583357915.0,I was like this. Didn't know why..then started Jungian psychology. In a man..part of you is female. It is like a psyche of its own. It comes in the form of perfection. like a secret goddess. It's hidden but powerful. when you interact with women this image is projected onto them. They are also doing this on you...on reverse. This is like the yin n Yang symbol...male and female with a little of each in both halves. If your mother was a peach like mine..loving..caring..good etc then it can be hard for your masculinity to progress because this anima has been projected out instead of felt with the emotions. Your anima is cryin cos it prob wants you to make a move. But you need to work on integrating both to be able to know how. That's life bud. Your in for a great ride. Just look at what scares you most and move baby steps towards those things bit by bit. Everything you want to be and do but are denying. Own it baby. You will grow. Be patient to start. Get exercise and meditation into your routine. Listen to yourself. Care about yourself like you were your own best friend
