""Orange wine is, in fact, a misnomer, as it does not, contrary to popular belief refer to wine made with oranges. The ‚Äòorange‚Äô in orange wine simply refers to the colour of the drink, rather than its contents. It is a type of white wine made by leaving the grape seeds and skins in contact with the juice to create a deep orange-hued product.

To make orange wine, you mash white grapes in some ceramic or concrete vessel, and leave them to ferment (skins, seeds, and all), for anywhere between four days and over a year. It‚Äôs an ancient natural process that uses little to no additives, to create a white wine with a sour and nutty twist.

According to Wine Folly and Decanter, it was British wine importer David Harvey who coined the term orange wine to refer to this non-interventionalist style of winemaking. Also often referred to as ‚ÄòRamato‚Äô, which means ‚Äòauburn‚Äô in Italian."""

popheads,fpj8q0q,t1_fpdbal1,1588660008.0,Ugh still love that album. I had it on repeat for months when it came out.
popheads,fpj7c9y,t1_fpj77py,1588658755.0,"Yes, she was one of my suggested tracks on spotify this morning and I just took a deep dive into her eps,
micro mixtapes and debut album and fell in love with her. 

Her songs really speak to my issues with situationships and relationships lol. I was surprised that she was so young but so many new, young artists are out here these days!"
popheads,fpj6lti,t3_gdg8x4,1588658116.0,"I can't believe the late, great Leonard Cohen didn't make your list, as he only died recently.

Ofra Haza is also a great Israeli Jewish singer. She sang the song Deliver Us in English and Hebrew for The Prince of Egypt soundtrack & movie. 

I actually had no idea that P!nk was Jewish and I've loved her since her debut, and I think she's definitely known for being American, not Australian. I've never heard people confuse her for Australian before."
popheads,fpj65w3,t1_fphyng7,1588657743.0,"That must be why I could never get into her. She's basically seems like just a singer on the demos who should give the song to other artists. 

She's so bland with music but she shines when it comes to acting. She really needs to stick to that arena and I'm a fan of her acting."
