mathematics,f1w0fyg,t3_dauji9,1569778529.0,"Before an exam, I like to find problems that I'd hate to be asked to solve on the exam, and work them out. If you can solve those, even if you have to review/ask for help, you're prepared for the exam. Just be sure to re-do those problems you needed help on all on your own.

Think of it this way: practice is like a workout for your brain. You sort of get ""muscle memory"" for a lot of computations. If you'll be going deeper into math, though, it would be wise to learn to prove some of those theorems in your textbook, no matter how intuitive it is."
Schizoid,f1vymoy,t3_daw1j0,1569777790.0,"I think that for them to even suggest Asperger's, they saw something different in how you behaved socially in addition to what your father exaggerated about you. You've probably always had some schizoid traits, but then the betrayal (which absolutely impacts you socially) at a sensitive age might've added an avoidant and distrusting flavor to it. 

Growing up, I was subjected to gossip by females in whatever social circles I ended up in. I got along better with guys because I've always been a science geek, behave like a nerdy guy, and I'm attractive.

Even though I'm in my 20s, the experiences I've had over the past year have made me even more schizoid. I'm a STEM major and I'm usually only one of two females in my classes. In all but one time, when the other female wants to partner up and study, I end up having to tutor them, which takes time away from me to fully conceptualize material. And then with male classmates, I haven't had a semester where I wasn't asked for my number of the ""bros"" in the class. This semester is even worse (happened twice last Wednesday). I hate being approached like that. It's making my desire for extreme isolation worse."

My mom was very anxious/cautious when I played outside, but otherwise, I was allowed a lot more privacy than other kids my age. She didn't even go through my belongings or look at my browsing history or texts. The exception was the GPS tracker on my phone (and she'd call me if it said I'm a block away from where I should be).

Once I was old enough to develop my own views on life (I was like 10), she became really reactionary, at times verbally abusive, whenever she felt her ego or views threatened. She would go overboard at times with retaliation and name-calling, but I received the mildest form of this out of everyone. I don't think she said anything worse than being told I'm going to hell, but she also says that people who are depressed hate God so... This was a problem she had only with adults and had few friends as a result. She definitely had a milder form of borderline or maybe narcissistic personality disorder (childhood abuse) ."

Schizoid,f0zabyn,t3_d7bbow,1569090386.0,"This comes from a different perspective as a female.

I've had schizoid traits literally my entire life. It's simply who I am. No abuse. Probably hereditary, though.

Even with the tendency to avoid contact with strangers and hating talking to people, there was no concern about autism, and my parents were psychiatrists who worked with developmental disorders. According to my family, I didn't like strangers even as a newborn (didn't cry when I was born, but cried whenever I saw someone other than my parents). As a toddler and beyond, I didn't like being praised or being the center of attention. I didn't like affection, didn't like it when people touched me, and I expressed or felt little emotion compared to kids my age.

I have a feeling that ASD is the only thing considered when there's any tendency to withdraw socially or talk funny or have weird tastes in things. Schizoid traits since childhood could simply be a tendency towards having a schizoid personality, without having a developmental disorder."

Schizoid,f0wb2vj,t3_d5kmvu,1569003237.0,"I don't think you can truly know in the present. You don't know if it's paranoia or intuition until after the event occurs. Keep in mind that it's natural for the mind to have a degree of confirmation bias. It's a tendency to have better recall of events that confirm our fears and desires than it is to have events that disprove them. So, to be safe, it's best to assume that it could be paranoia. However, it's good to keep in mind the possibility of an event you fear, so long as it's within the realm of being realistic. 

I get that same thing. I've been wondering if it's confirmation bias, if I'm too lost in fantasy land, or if I'm able to perceive/interpret my surroundings in a way that allows me to develop an intuition for potential future events. Many of my strangest gut feelings have become reality, but some of simplest intuitions have been inaccurate. It's hard to distinguish between intuition, desire, and fear. Having the schizoid daydream tendency probably makes that worse. 

I don't know though, I obviously get too lost in my own thoughts."

Because my cubicle at work is placed so that I'm the first person anyone sees, I get irritable if I don't have enough alone time each day/week. I don't go into a complete rage, but I will at times get angry and very snappy when someone talks to me when I get in that mode."

... And also kind of. Some things in calc 3 are kind of similar to calc 1 in that you can relate them back to some of the things you learned in calc 1, but they're not exactly the same. For example: You know what slope is. Okay, now what is kind of like slope, but in 3D? That whole ""3D-ish"" slope thing isn't just a geometric thing/draw the thing on the coordinate plane anymore either. Then, depending on your curriculum, you have vectors, which then relate to the whole 3D-ish slope thing.

It's more fascinating and involved than calc 1, which will make it slightly harder for some, but the experience with calculus may make it easier for others."

This could be an ADHD thing, but the easiest tasks (daily or at work) that require the least amount of mental involvement (but maybe some more time) are the ones that I avoid the most. I get bored, start thinking about something else, and make careless errors or simply don't do it."
Schizoid,f0fsjbi,t3_d430by,1568588526.0,"I was a bit self-seeking when it came to friendships. I used them for entertainment and I interpreted the term ""friend"" as ""entertainment provider"". I was attached only to my mother throughout my childhood, but I would never want to receive any affection or words of endearment. I just wanted her there with me. Our relationship went to ass once I started developing a more adult personality (she didn't get along with adults). She died three years ago. The loss didn't affect me, but I feel bad for *her* in that I'm in the living/hunger situation she did everything in her power to avoid for me.

Romantically, my last two relationships sort of just happened. I was going through the motions and before I knew it, I was in long term relationships. I am a dopamine addict though. When my brain sort of latches on to someone, and they become an object of my fantasies, I'll get all nervous and start caring about what they think about me, but those never become anything. Oh, and I tend to get disgusted by them if they don't live up to my expectations. Sexual encounters are infrequent, even in a relationship."
Schizoid,f046mel,t3_d3f8gq,1568380889.0,"Set the desire to build relationships with people aside. Are you an introvert? Do you meet the diagnostic criteria that was used back then and the criteria used now? If so, it could be schizoid or something that presents with similar symptoms. Either way, you're getting somewhere closer to an answer.

There are schizoids who are married and have long-term relationships. The thing is that the dynamic in the relationship might seem unusual to others or the partner may be unhappy about emotional detachment and lack of intimacy. Also, schizoids aren't necessarily devoid of empathy, but we may come off that way at times.

You don't have to be entirely removed from the presence of people to qualify as Real Schizoid™ , but social and interpersonal impairment in the form of ""Just shut up, leave me alone, I don't care if your cat died"" should be there. If the content of this subreddit describes you, then you're probably leaning towards schizoid, but definitely look at other things that match your symptoms before giving yourself a label. Avoid cognitive biases when you're doing this, even though it's not like extreme accuracy really matters treatment-wise (like it would with bipolar). It's  just  nice knowing what you have.

So, take some time to look at the nature of your friendships and relationships. For any that have ended, why did they end? The key thing to look for is if there were issues that stemmed from you being distant or cold. Also, look at what happens when you reach a more committed or personal stage of a relationship. Oh, and think about how much you daydream and introspect. That's kind of a thing too, but not an exclusively schizoid thing."
Schizoid,f030hhs,t3_d36zbn,1568341908.0,"Nope. Not normal. Many of my schizoid traits are naturally occurring, but I think the way I was raised reinforced those traits.

I'm sure there's some hereditary component in addition to nurture. Everyone on my mom's side has a diagnosed Cluster B personality disorder. All of the Cluster B's are in there, even antisocial (grandpa and uncle) My dad's side is naturally introverted and there are some likely-schizoids in there.

Mother: She was very loving until I started to become more like an adult. She often took differences in opinion/tastes the wrong way and overreact as a defense mechanism. Her fear of abandonment made her controlling as well. I was attached to her (and only her) as a child, but as I matured and experienced her reactions, I ended up feeling nothing. She passed away 3 years ago and I still feel nothing. No hard feelings, no sad feelings. I just want my living expenses paid for again and I feel really bad for not feeling much else in response to her death.

Dad: Has bipolar disorder that leans towards the depressive side. It went untreated until I was an adult. He isolated himself and became distant during depressive episodes.He's the definition of a good person with a kind heart, though.  He taught me how to be respectful and to accept people for who they are. He'd even protect me from my mother's verbal abuse. But, I would go on days without seeing him and months without having a conversation with him. He's naturally not affectionate and only mildly expressive. The natural schizoid in me felt fine with this, but I think that our dynamic made me too comfortable with silence and lack of expression."

As for relationships, I honestly don't see anything wrong until the other person expresses that they think I don't like them or that I'm cheating on them. After the honeymoon phase, which tends to match my fantasy world pretty well, I go to my natural self: cold, unaffectionate, and having no desire to have sex with others, especially if I'm close to them.
