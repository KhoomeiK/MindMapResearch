ForeverAlone,fmo0cy8,t1_fmewxqb,1586240880.0,"I had planned to make a full update post but here is were i am currently.  We have been on 2 really successful dates were i was able to make her laugh a whole lot.  The third was set to happen but this whole coronavirus has essentially made it impossible to do any more in person stuff for a bit.  Our first date was at an aquarium, our second date was just talking in the car(originally it was getting coffee), third date was set to just be walking somewere but has been essentially put off until this coronavirus stuff gets let serious.

She does say she wants to resume in person dates after this whole coronavirus situation.  That said who knows.  At least if we resume (i think we will) i will be able to take her on at least more interesting dates.

In the meantime I have gotten 3 other numbers off various girls from tinder but again same deal can't really do anything beyond text right now because of this coronavirus.

im honestly not depressed anymore too.  i went from active on my depression account all the time to using my main account again.  Just knowing any woman would be willing to go on a date has done wonders for my mental state.  That said of course i would only get interest from a lady with a global pandemic complicating things."

Pain of not having any real friendship or love going on nearly 3 decades is too much.  People who have never experienced this pain For such an extreme length of time don’t get how bad it gets as you age and nearly everyone else has it.

But now people can show up and ""get users help"".  Seems like bad news for people who want to vent about depression, fa, isolation, loneliness etc without being hassled.

Loneliness is a epidemic in the United States right now.  Not everyone who is a virgin is some massive misogynistic asshole.  Plenty are ugly, plenty have scarring or disabilities or a lack of social skills, no friends etc.

Everyone on some level believes what they are told growing up that their is someone for everyone, everyone wants love and companionship, its hardwired into us to seek it and on some level its needed to feel loved.  Plenty of people wake up distraught about being a decent human being and just being alone seemingly forever.  See r/foreveralone for an example of what im talking about.  I don't believe wanting or longing to be loved is a crime at all.  I also don't think we can expect them to be happy alone forever either.  Entitlement is probably the wrong word to use in this situation, many simply think im not a total piece of human scum am i not deserving of a chance at a relationship eventually if i keep being a kind/funny/whatever human being.

Male tears, calling people virgins etc.  do you ever stop too wonder if that might actually play a role in enforcing a system that hurts men and women?  

If not having sex and holding an opinion you disagree with just instantly makes you jump to calling them an Incel, your kind of a jerk.  Really it’s not too different than when people call feminists sluts for doing x.  Sexual activity and how much or little one does it should not be used as an insult.

I am only 5'6 and pretty weak (working on it though).  Just a few weeks ago their was a thread on twoxchromosomes about just how much suprisingly stronger guys were.  Most guys are fucking harmless but it doesn't change the fact that the average guy is waaaay stronger than the average woman.

Thats why girls carry pepper spray etc and aim to protect themselves.  I don't really think crossing the street is any different, its just choosing to protect yourself.  I do feel a bit sad when they do it though because i have legit felt guilty killing bugs before lol (as a kid).  But im not gonna get offended by it.  

I respect a woman feeling unsafe and choosing to do that, but i also support when my fellow guys say they feel saddened about it, they are both legitimate things to feel."

My odds of finding a dominant woman would probably still be super low to begin with.  Since it seems most women are simply not into that or seem to trend towards submissive.  Although i am a little bit switchy.

she talks about r/foreveralone a subreddit were a large percent of posters may not have even kissed anyone or gotten so far as a 2nd date.  Its no suprise she got treated differently considering she said she had been in a serious relationship before, something most of that sub can only dream of.  Granted it sounds like the relationship she was in was not a good one.

No one buys them drinks or agrees to date them, its just a constant stream of rejections for them.  Dating as a guy can be brutal as hell.

Social skills/ personality/mental issues/meeting people is the largest problems that people on this subreddit seem to have.

For attractive people they need to meet far fewer total people in order find someone they could date and having poor social skills doesn't kill them so much.  For a lot of the less attractive people having poor social skills is a literal death sentence in that they need to meet more people and they end up talking to less people and are do poorly when they do.

dating,fabr1z9,t1_fabeqcz,1575927427.0,"its total bullshit no one ever tells women the entitlement narrative men are always given.  Like, everyone wants to be loved, its not a fucking crime."
ForeverAlone,f9i8ley,t1_f9g0x1h,1575330908.0,"yup i have two pretty good gaming friends who i have been gaming with almost daily for about half a decade.  Honestly i don't have any friends i know in real life but online friends at least count for something.

Shit anything that gets my mind of the daily existential crisis about how i will probably be in the same boat at 40, is pretty good."
ForeverAlone,f918h2z,t1_f8vl5vq,1574984252.0,"genuinely interested in what kind of groups did you join.  Meetup.com sort of stuff or like, Beer league hockey sort of stuff?


Im in the same sort of funk were i kind of ended up at the point were i don't have any friends and need to rebuild so to speak, so advice from someone who has been there would be helpful."
hiking,f88qv7e,t1_f88h479,1574359446.0,looks a bit chilly thats for sure.
virgin,f88ks26,t3_dzck14,1574356360.0,"Eh i want a relationship and losing my virginity is just part of what that would likely entail.  Its way more than just the sex, i know sex is not a be all end all, its just that its generally attached to something bigger.  I want someone to talk to about my day and cuddle, its not just sex.  Its wanting to feel legitimately wanted for who you are.  That last part makes a prostitute a worthless idea, its not legitimate, its just a cash exchange for a rendered service, a service no one else has to pay for.  I want to lose my virginity to someone who i will have a relationship with, it doesn't matter if its 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 months or the rest of my life.  

I am 100% certain i will feel just as empty minus the virginity at the end of the hour.  I might even feel more empty."
