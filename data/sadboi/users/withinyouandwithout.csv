so yes. i don‚Äôt know that psychiatrists or doctors even need to manage psychedelic use, they just need to understand them as an organic way to heal the trauma that our egos claim. 

i think psychedelics are a great way to ‚Äòsee‚Äô your ego and how destructive it is to the singular self and the collective self, and in this day and age seeing seems to be believing, so it may prove to be extremely beneficial.

edit: i also think they do a better job of actually ‚Äòcuring‚Äô mental health than big pharma and even therapy, because of how personal and expansive these experiences can be. psychedelics go straight for the root of the issue, where SSRI or whatever only suppress the symptoms of a much much larger issue."

so yes, i see an emphasis on the masculine in business, as it‚Äôs survival and gain based. the masculine seeks to gain, the feminine to regulate. i‚Äôm just saying that i notice these arch√©types in ways today that are truly almost undetectable because of the unwillingness to accept them (probably because of the offense words like patriarchy and sexism can insight) these words cannot offend you as they DO make up history and our lives even if it‚Äôs not ‚Äòtechnically‚Äô the same today."

the IDEA of business was built on the shoulders of the patriarchy, where it has not moved but has been deeply rooted (and almost entirely forgotten/debased/disregarded) after generations accepting this as the reality of the world

these grad school discussions observe patterns as they present themselves across ALL of time and space, where the patriarchy still runs 99% of the systems in the US and across a lot of the world 

i‚Äôm just asking for people to realize what they‚Äôre even arguing for or against before they call someone legitimately retarded (a rather outdated word) 

business on a literal scheme is multi sexed, of course. it‚Äôs 2020. but it was not created with the intention of giving women any authority or agency regarding their own lives, that‚Äôs how the patriarchy manifested itself into what it is nowadays. the after affects of this intention to silence women are still very real and deep today, to the point where it‚Äôs almost unrecognizable

before you post on reddit about her, think about if you‚Äôve put her into a category already, see that you (likely) have put her into MANY, understand that that‚Äôs SUBCONSCIOUSLY (perhaps even consciously) the patriarchy after years and years and years of perpetuation.

mental health is the same as bodily health. the wound inflames to heal itself. when depression feels overwhelming, it‚Äôs trying to tell you to make a change in your thought patterns. depression is not ‚Äòinflicting‚Äô you, you are inflicting it, and you can heal it just as you heal a paper cut"

Psychic,fmtjl72,t1_fmti2nd,1586373834.0,thank you!!!!
ween,fmsvi1u,t3_fx0y3g,1586362647.0,hahahaha i feel at last superior to the male species as i can sing every high ween song with perfect ease with my dainty woman voice
kundalini,fmp4633,t1_fmp3egx,1586274101.0,"yeah! some are far too in their ways to have a change in perspective. some are not meant to wake up during this lifetime. all you can do is keep working on yourself as you are! :) you were fortunate enough to be inclined to breathe and research instead of panic and worsen, as many in our culture are conditioned to do"
kundalini,fmp2izl,t1_fmp1ypv,1586273189.0,"i fear that many will go to the doctors and get a pointless medication addiction or diagnosis that‚Äôs completely absurd because of the fear an awakening can cause. after my experience i went to the ER and they just told me i had a panic attack and to stop smoking weed, put me on meds i didn‚Äôt need and told me to see a psychiatrist. now i‚Äôm feeling great, tapered off the meds myself with no withdrawal symptoms, and i‚Äôm growing along with my energy"
Antipsychiatry,fmp1n01,t1_fmouf15,1586272690.0,"her brain does have adderal deficiency, now. and will until the end of time unless they come to term with their addictions to the drug and find another way to ‚Äòcope‚Äô"
Antipsychiatry,fmp19tc,t3_fwl348,1586272487.0,oh my god this is insane. this is straight up full fledged addiction. but it‚Äôs okay it‚Äôs adderal and i‚Äôm prescribed this! my doctor knows best! no judgement from the world because this is official and totally unlike any other drug addiction!
kundalini,fmp0afw,t3_fwk67n,1586271950.0,"beautiful!!!! so many people are experiencing kundalini but without knowing what it is, and they get scared and don‚Äôt know how to properly care for their energy"
ween,fmmoxva,t3_fw2xmu,1586209303.0,"never described a ween song as scary before, the scarier the song the more i feel it lol"
ween,fmicxc3,t3_fvdo66,1586107088.0,damn i want all of these as pins
kundalini,fmhyof9,t1_fmhy6wt,1586097815.0,"that‚Äôs the same as not wanting to be a human because there are murderers out there. you truly won‚Äôt know unless you try it. if you are a more vocal person, you could try chanting chakra meditations, that‚Äôs what i like to do. there are also dynamic meditations that involve movement and heavy breath work to activate the energy. I even think the ‚Äòrunners high‚Äô they talk about is really an active and balanced kundalini. your ego is giving you fear, and you‚Äôll give up both of those with this process."
kundalini,fmhxsmv,t1_fmhxmws,1586097080.0,"i say if you‚Äôre interested to learn about your energies now, that‚Äôs a call in and of itself that you may be ready. i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever ‚Äòknow‚Äô that you‚Äôre ‚Äòready‚Äô :)"
