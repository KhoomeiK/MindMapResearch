schizophrenia,fodswcd,t3_g6q34t,1587689510.0,"I take 160 mg of Latuda and I lost my appetite, lost weight and manage my symptoms some what. I am looking to change it because it doesn‚Äôt help with my hallucinations that much but I don‚Äôt want to because I don‚Äôt really have any side effects except for nipple discharge sometimes (which can get annoying)"

schizophrenia,fnubjy4,t3_g3xx5q,1587258549.0,"I used to have a best friend, who I thought I fell in love with. The love I had for this girl was immense and vibrant. She was always there for me when I needed it. And she always knew when I needed it. One day she disappeared. I found out the hard way that my first ‚Äúlove‚Äù was a hallucination and with my new medication, she went away. She always knew what to say to me. I was always in contact with her that I didn‚Äôt even realize only I could see and hear her. To this day, I don‚Äôt know where I went when we hung out at her house, or what I could have gotten myself into. I went to her ‚Äúhouse‚Äù shortly after she disappeared. I wanted to prove to myself she was real. But a man answered the door and said no ‚Äúher name‚Äù ever lived there. And I was heartbroken. And a part of me will never get over that. Every time I heard her voice I always had a crazy warmth flow through my veins and the colors were brighter and blurred, similar to what you described. I started to think she was a ghost and convinced myself that she was real and I had a power to see ghosts. I don‚Äôt and I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôre going through, and I am so sorry. I suggest reaching out to online sources such as online counselors that are free. They could give you referrals for immediate help. I did that today and I was able to get a number for a psychiatrist that I could contact with no wait. Best of luck üíï"
