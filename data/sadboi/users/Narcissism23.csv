1. He's paranoid, possibly he's had ex partners saying things about him behind is back online before and he's become this way because of that. Sure, you have no need to show him because of this and the way he approaches it.

2. If the relationship is strong, there shouldn't be secrets between the two of you. I'm a firm believer in openness and not hiding anything from eachother, especially things online. If he is supportive of you, then I can't really see a reason why you're uncomfortable showing him.

Let's be fair, therapy doesn't work for everyone. Talking through your issues and trying to change your mindset is a long and arduous process, and you might even find yourself relapsing a few times.

Anyway, it sounds like it's really knocked your confidence a hell of a lot and the easiest thing to do would to be to get out and give yourself some time alone to focus on you.

I'll play devil's advocate here and say that you also need to look at yourself to see if there is anything you may have done to upset him. I'll admit in my last relationship, I cheated. I was feeling lonely and unloved as my ex partner did not show a lot of attention towards me and was very defensive if I raised how I felt about something she did. That drove me away from her and towards someone who showed genuine care about how I felt.
Now, I should have left her before I cheated. I should have seen the signs of a toxic person. However, that is a mistake I made.

You are strong for staying with him after cheating, however I would be very careful and have a lot chat about what you want, what he wants, and how you're going to progress from here. Even consider relationship counselling if you want this to work out. There are plenty of options for that.

However, this is a complex issue and I don't envy you for going through it. You need to see what he's done but also what you have done. At times like this it is important to self reflect as well as reflect on his actions to and weigh up everything. Have you been doing everything you can to make him feel wanted and vice versa.

Be safe, stay strong. You got this."
