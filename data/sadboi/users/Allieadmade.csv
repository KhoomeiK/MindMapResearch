babushkadogs,fr3lu60,t3_gm279e,1589860269.0,She‚Äôs so sweet :) beautiful fabric too !
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fr00v80,t1_fqvz7f3,1589780505.0,Yeah I totally didn‚Äôt think of it being from like an antidepressant either which is pretty likely too. I‚Äôm bipolar as well but thankfully my mood stabilizer doesn‚Äôt cause weight gain but some of my other meds do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è win some you lose some. I‚Äôve had meds cause weight gain and weight loss so I understand where she‚Äôs coming from.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqvvxx8,t1_fqvvttt,1589686414.0,Me too ! I gained some weight when I was put on it
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqvvktz,t1_fqvrjwl,1589686173.0,I‚Äôve been on and off topamax for a while and the first time I was on it I dropped some pounds for sure. I was on it for bipolar first and now for migraines but my psychologist referred to topamax as ‚Äúdopamax‚Äù or like the ‚ÄúCalifornia pill‚Äù because it makes you skinny and stupid lol.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqvvfbq,t1_fqvruai,1589686074.0,Ya I‚Äôve been on it for years and topamax. There‚Äôs a lot of crossover between seizure medication and migraine medication as well as bipolar medication because it‚Äôs all essentially your brain misfiring (or that‚Äôs how it was explAined to me)
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqvono3,t1_fqvg6ws,1589681748.0,Wasn‚Äôt she having issues with migraines ? It‚Äôs possible she got put on lyrica or gabapentin which will make you gain weight

TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqjim79,t1_fqjg7mt,1589410455.0,HahHa probably none! This location has changed businesses more than I can count! Plus it‚Äôs like a boutique type store and this isn‚Äôt really a boutique type town hahah
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fqjiidy,t1_fqjhwmv,1589410408.0,It was some type of little boutique type store it looked like.
EDanonymemes,fpw3bdz,t1_fpvzv7o,1588956524.0,You‚Äôre so right ! I was very excited to see it especially since I‚Äôm the same height as her in the game so it was nice to see a realistic weight. It‚Äôs crazy how much people don‚Äôt realize how much more you‚Äôll weigh just because you‚Äôre taller. Guys used to guess I weighed like 115 lbs before I was even THAT thin and at 5‚Äô11 that would obviously look way thinner. And then I did weigh that much and less and looked like a complete skeleton person ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just so unrealistic to say a tall woman weighs so little without having her look literally like a skeleton.
AnimalCrossing,fpvhhbz,t3_gfs8na,1588944868.0,I love the curly ones! So cute

EDanonymemes,fpt29jw,t1_fpt0kfg,1588883608.0,Oh my god Hahahaha ! Was that the show?? He refused to eat bananas! I honestly couldn‚Äôt even remember what show it was but I can just hear his fucking voice in my head clear as day saying it and I love bananas but I always think of it!!!

EDanonymemes,fpqv6qw,t3_gev075,1588833199.0,I can‚Äôt remember what show it was but I saw it when I was probably like 12-15 and it was a true life type of show and it may have been true life but it was about a guy who had an eating disorder and he was talking about his different foods he would eat amd he was making like one burrito with a specific amount of beans or something at dinner and his family was trying to get him to eat a banana and he said ‚Äúbananas are the most caloric fruit‚Äù and his voice saying that has been in my head ever since lol. I had a phobia of bananas for a long time because of the sound they made when you eat them but maybe it was something more deep seated ? Wow. Profound.

migraine,fpjojq8,t3_gdq2yk,1588676093.0,"That‚Äôs exactly where mine always hurt the worst ! I never know how to describe the pain like it feels almost like I got hit in the back or the head with a baseball bat or something. That‚Äôs the closest I can get. Always on the right side.

I‚Äôve been seeing a neurologist for about five years now since I had my first hemiplegic episode but have suffered from migraines all my life. I take daily medication, abortives, monthly injections of ajovy, was about to restart Botox (it stopped working and I stopped doing it for about a year), and the only somewhat relief I can get is from mmj. It‚Äôs the worst pain. And nothing helps"

AskDocs,fpf6pvu,t1_fpcl8be,1588563108.0,Yeah! it‚Äôs scary because it‚Äôs a symptom of really scary stuff! That‚Äôs why I ended up actually going to the er later in the day when I woke up with it because it wasn‚Äôt going away and I was like okay better get this checked haha
interestingasfuck,fpf6l98,t1_fpe987q,1588563021.0,I always think about the terrible sound it must make
braceletcraft,fpf4pkf,t3_gcw92a,1588561728.0,I used to attach the bracelets with a safety pin to my pants while I was making them and it worked really well! I‚Äôd just put a safety pin thru the loop and pin them to my pants or you can pin them to like the sheets on your bed if they‚Äôre tucked in because that‚Äôs usually enough force applied back to keep it pretty in place. Really you can pin them to anything stationary but my best bet was always my pants then that way you can just sit with your knees up and do the bracelet
AskDocs,fpc5hhn,t1_fpc4zk4,1588488260.0,Same with mine for both things. Since this person mentioned something about their contact I just thought I‚Äôd mention it because mine was contact related

NotTimAndEric,fp2p3th,t1_fp2guz8,1588265527.0,"I have a horrible singing voice so Anyone who is a professional singer of any caliber is a million steps ahead of me haha. He sounded  good singing it until it came to the high notes the puddle of Mudd guy. I think as far as Kurt goes this is just what Kurts  voice sounded like so it was a lot easier for him you know ? So like trying to imitate is really hard on other people like he obviously had a unique voice that isn‚Äôt technically good so I bet that had something to do with the song being hard to sing maybe ? I have no idea I don‚Äôt know anything about singing haha.

Like I think trying to imitate him is the wrong way to go like singing it in your own voice and kind of style  would be the right way to go you know what I‚Äôm saying?"

MovieMistakes,fo36iix,t1_fo36ay9,1587481463.0,Glamorama!! Omg I think about that one all the time and couldn‚Äôt remember the name for years !!!! Thank you!! That book honestly haunted me!!! I saw American psycho and loved it and had to read the book and then read all his books after that. I enjoyed them all but lunar park is my favorite which is funny because American psycho is one of my favorite movies but not one of my favorite books! The movie just really hits my funny bone
MovieMistakes,fo35erd,t1_fo32mpi,1587480876.0,Yeah that‚Äôs very true. Plus this takes in to account the fact that there‚Äôs a Patrick Bateman character in lunar park that is/isn‚Äôt Patrick Bateman and a lot of watchers and probably readers of American psycho don‚Äôt realize that Patrick Bateman is a character that is featured in a lot of his books and is related to another main character of a book and has complicated relationships with characters in his other books and there‚Äôs characters from his other books in American psycho the book. But I guess one of the points of lunar park was that he just couldn‚Äôt get away from Patrick Bateman even if he tried so I guess that makes a lot of sense considering what I just wrote because lunar park ‚Äúisn‚Äôt‚Äù supposed to be one of the novels featuring all of his characters blah blah blah. Idk interesting books haha. Lunar park is definitely my favorite
MovieMistakes,fo31a05,t1_fo2dlxt,1587478615.0,I think this is an example of Patrick playing around with the idea in real life actually.
MovieMistakes,fo31301,t1_fo2x8so,1587478506.0,That‚Äôs my favorite book of his but I always thought it was kind of up to the reader anyway as to what happened. I mean you‚Äôre the one reading the book haha
