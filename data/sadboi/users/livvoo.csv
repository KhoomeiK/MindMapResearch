Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fqoavi7,t1_fqnzl17,1589511194.0,"Yes absolutely, it was A Scandal in Bohemia, it was the first paragraph of the text printed over and over and both sides of the scarf. I guess that would have been important info but in my childhood I always associated that story with A study in Scarlet as they are printed together in my set. Anyway, it goes from 
""To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman"" to ""of dubious and questionable memory"". I think it was printed four or five times per side? 

I have absolutely no clue what an ASIS is, so if you could expand on that I could answer to the best of my ability. Would not have been replaced, it was tucked away in the corner of my room, I only picked it up today when I was going though my old Sherlock set. It was dusty and definitely not new. 

Now the dress code incident. I'm introverted by nature, but with teachers it's a whole other story. I was frankly quite embarrassed they called me in at all so made no effort to defend the scarf. It was easy enough to take off so there was no protest from me. The conversation went as is. 

""Hello there, do you know why you're here today"" 

""Um my teacher said something about dress code?"" I was looking down at my outfit like *excuse me I look like a nun* 

""Your scarf is reported to have some foul language""

""...""

""Let me see it.... yes here. Sex, you can't wear this"" 

""Okay I'm sorry"" and I took it off and stowed it in my backpack. 

(Something like that) 

And that was the end of it. I only later realized they called home. My mom didn't care. I explained the story and that was the end of it.

I am so sorry for my formatting, I'm on mobile.

Edit: just realized I'm a complete idiot. It was a scandal in Bohemia not a study in scarlet. I read my books in the wrong order and just now realized I've been messing up the titles. But tbh who pays attention to titles. Whoops. I do know the story however by heart. Literally could type the first few pages word for word if asked."

https://storiarts.com/products/sherlock-holmes-book-scarf 

As you can see it's the Hounds of Baskervilles. I asked my mom about any emails and she said they clear automatically after a month if they aren't business. So I really don't know how to get more info on that. I can however try to get in contact with the manufacturer! It's the same scarf, so someone may have been drop shipping from there the first time around. As for the school incident, the dress code policy was pretty hit or miss. This particular day I got called down though. they had me take off the scarf and put it in my bag. I suspect that's why, it was easy to take off. I don't think the call was stored any where, but I can ask.

It was the part of the story when Sherlock asks John for help and then tells him that ""[He] may not be luminous, but [he] is a conductor of light"". The whole thing is just a mockery of John. Kind of fitting lmao.

Fashion can be used to express yourself on the outside. But if that's not important to you, that's okay!!
