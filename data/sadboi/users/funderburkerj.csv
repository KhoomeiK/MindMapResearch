I've also had pastors in my life treat this as a spiritual issue instead of a biological issue, so I'm very impressed by your faith as well. Its hard to understand why a God lets things like this happen, but I suppose everyone has his cross to bear."

BipolarReddit,fnlfvbe,t1_fnjo39m,1587052825.0,"Your husband sounds incredible! And you sound like you have a good grip on your experiences too. I think making you sleep off any mania is a pretty good idea - but does it go well for you? I mean, for me, when I start showing any signs of mania I get very stubborn and argumentative, so I can't imagine I could handle being essentially locked out and told to sleep. Mania is definitely the scariest part of the disorder for me, and I just don't know the best way to get a handle on it once it starts."

Normally I overthink any social media post I make and usually don't go through with posting anything... but when the mania creeps in I'll share anything without a second thought."
