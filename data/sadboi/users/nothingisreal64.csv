TalkTherapy,fql1f04,t3_gjegm2,1589442941.0,"First thing I want to say is you're not alone, lots of people have feelings like this about their therapist. I don't mean to diminish your experience in anyway, I just want to say that because I know it really does feel weird when it happens. 

I felt the same way. I have some sexual abuse history and it left me with a lot of shame when it comes to sex. My therapist has been helping me get over that shame but now when I'm engaging in sexual stuff, sometimes she comes to mind because I'm doing my best to not feel ashamed about it. It's totally weird and I don't want her to come to mind but sometimes she does.

I will say that when it started happening, it happened a lot and constantly, but then I decided to talk to her about it. It felt awkward to bring up, but she completely understood it and we talked about how it was just an avenue for me to grow out of what I was experiencing previously. Over time it faded away. It still happens from time to time but isn't nearly as big of a deal as when it first happened and when she does come to mind, it's a lot easier to let her go and get back to the what's going on currently. 

To be perfectly honest, your relationship with your therapist and talking about your feelings towards her is often where you deal with the most important stuff. 

>so I’m thinking there’s a deep rooted desire for gaining her approval. 

That's a big insight. As awkward and as weird as it may feel to talk about this stuff with her, it might lead to some really good therapeutic moments. Maybe be a little careful with how you bring it up just to make sure you say it the way you want to and whatnot, but all therapists should be trained and capable of handling these types of things. It shouldn't ruin the relationship."

I'm not a therapist, I'm starting a program in the fall, but I currently work in the tech industry and I'd recommend G Suite for business. It's one of the easiest platforms for getting up and running and you can easily manage this type of stuff using groups and access restrictions. Also, cloud based has its advantages as well. 

I would definitely look into HIPPA compliance/confidentiality for storing things in the cloud and whatnot, but I know for a fact that medical providers do use G Suite to store health data and restrict access.

Google also has really solid documentation when you don't know how to do something.

CPTSD,fps4lc9,t1_fpru4r3,1588867367.0,"Yes absolutely, although I wouldn't necessarily call it ""overthinking"" as much as it is mistaking where the problem is coming from. And that in of itself could shed light on what the real issue is.

For example, I used to regularly get frantic/manic and upset/irritable on a daily basis. I thought it was hypomania or the beginnings of a manic episode coming on, but it turned out that I just wasn't eating and those feelings were coming from being hungry/angry/ravenous. (At that time, my first meal of the day was often around 5-7pm.) Discovering that though led to more questions about: why am I not recognizing that I'm hungry? Why am I out of touch with my body and not sensing what it's trying to tell me? Once I started asking those questions I realized I was spending most of my time dissociated on some level (something I'm sure is common with lots of CPTSD folks.)

So, in that example, the ""simple"" issue is that I needed to eat more food at the proper times, but the best solution turned out to be more regular meditation, reflection, stretching and overall checking in with my body.

Essentially, just as the issue can elude us and be more simple than we expect, the answer can also elude us and be more complex than we expect. I'm not saying this is always true, but something like ""overthinking"" might have a different root cause than ""forgetting to drink water."" The ""solution"" may be simple but the understanding can be rich and complex."
CPTSD,fpr40wf,t1_fpqf6yj,1588841589.0,Of course and thanks for your reflection. Glad this post resonated with you :)
CPTSD,fpr3nzt,t1_fpqywq9,1588841225.0,"Of course! Regular therapy could definitively be helpful for these kinds of things. 

The not feeling ""ready or good enough"" sounds like it might be coming from being overly critical and negative thoughts towards yourself (common in depression/anxiety). The ""visually/mentally overloaded"" sound a bit like mild panic attacks, particularly with the sweating and vision changes (rapid and/or difficult breathing are common as well). Dissociation has more to do with disconnecting from reality, being out of touch and out of place. Dissociation is most often the sense of feeling like you're not in your body anymore, like you're looking at yourself from a birds eye view. 

Not trying to diagnose or anything, just providing my immediate thoughts and experiences with these things. As I mentioned before, definitely worth exploring this stuff in therapy if you can! They'll have better thoughts and questions than I can write here for sure"
CPTSD,fpqwbmm,t1_fpqlvm3,1588834186.0,"I think the key thing you said was:
>I inherently know that going out alone just isn’t something I can handle right now.

This might be something beter addressed in therapy, but my first inclination is to ask why. Like, what is it about going out that makes it something you have to ""handle""? Is there a way you could go out without necessarily ""handling"" anything? This could mean avoiding people so you don't have to handle them or it could mean going out in an emotionally vulnerable or naked sorta way, where you might not have 100% control of all of your emotions but you do it anyway because it's good for you and you've decided to do it anyways. 

I don't mean to suggest that you should purposefully subject yourself to a ton of pain or anything, take small steps and do it at your pace. But being open and vulnerable, however painful it may get, is important in therapy. Within reason, I find that there's always some pain or something I can't ""handle,"" right now though, these things are just very physically obvious.

And when going out, you might not be able to handle 100% of it, but you might be able to handle 70 or 80% of it. And if you try it and it doesn't work you can always turn around and try again later. You wouldn't be any lesser of a person, it would just mean that you need a little more practice and preparation.

This is one thing my therapist pushes me towards all the time because I am a bit of a control freak when it comes to my emotions. I get very rigid and dissociate all the time and when it came to this, I was scared of being near or seen by people and I was constantly hypervigilant. But once I started forgetting about them and turning inward -- focusing my needs, emotions, and vulnerability -- I felt more drive and openness to leaving my place."

psychotherapy,fopyyd2,t3_g8smn2,1587976926.0,"(Not a therapist, starting a program soon, but plenty of experience with heavy days working in a homeless shelter for young adults.) Getting in a routine helps, and it's important to do it on the lighter days too, that way the routine is associated with the healthier days where it's easier to let go, which will help you return to that way of processing on the heavier days.

It may sound silly, but I used to smoke cigarettes and after every shift, I would always smoke next to this tree outside my building. I don't smoke anymore but that time was always when I checked in with myself, felt present, focused on my breathing, processed shit, etc. I still go to that tree nowadays even though I don't smoke anymore. It doesn't ask anything of me and I don't have any obligation to it, but it's still there for me in a very stable and grounded way. On bad days I lean against it or touch some of the leaves. Idk, I don't want to romanticize it too much.

I find that the most important part of the routine though is to be present and aware of your body, breathing, presence. Seeing yourself, where you are in the physical world, what's around you and how you fit into it. What I'm describing here is a form of meditation really ... It's that feeling you get when you look at the moon, a sky full of stars, an incredible mountain, or the ocean -- there's humility, fulfillment, and acceptance of your place in the world.

In between sessions it can be a a few stretches, breathing, and looking out a window if possible, not necessarily deep meditation. TBH, I've got less strategies for between sessions because I'm not familiar with that yet. 

Only thing I can say is that the times the heavier stuff stays with me, I'm usually in my head and feelings flowing through me. Returning to my bodily sensations, movement, and the present world around me can bring me back to the ground. And then I can breathe through it knowing it's a feeling that will pass."
ptsd,fno71ek,t3_g2sz0a,1587114489.0,"I've had lots of days like this recently, where I'm afraid to sleep because of nightmares, afraid of being alone with my thoughts when I can't sleep, constantly watching videos or playing video games at all times to avoid being alone with my thoughts, not showering for a long time until my own smell becomes unbearable, overeating then undereating in an awful cycle, and most recently fear of going outside and an insane level of hypervigilance. I went for a walk around the block and when I got back, my jaw was sore from clenching the entire time. (Haven't really left my apartment in 2.5 weeks given the social distancing.)

I used to turn into hyper productive/exercise/cleaning mode, kinda like you described, but with social distancing, I'm not really able to do that, so it's devolved into indulgence and lazy chaos for me.

I wish I could offer some support or a means to an end, but in my experience, this stuff has to run its course. It's generally better to have patience, try to listen to it and hear what it's saying, try to soothe it and understand it rather than fight and control it. It can definitely be frightening but I know the more I fight it off, the longer it sticks around and the more it can hurt when it finally gets through.

I've found that the way it usually runs it's course is ... At the beginning, I can't think about anything but the memory/intrusive thoughts. I'm incredibly fixated, and it's lots of pain, anger, shame, hate and just all of the burning emotions. And then it fizzles a bit into anxiety and fear. And if I'm receptive and kind to it, it can normally pass at least partially until it either gets triggered again or can pass more completely, not in the sense that it goes away, but I'll all of a sudden start having thoughts about other things, good things, things in my life other than my trauma history, and I start to build up my mental capacity for my life outside of the trauma again."
ptsd,fnke2q2,t3_g27e9k,1587023614.0,"Didn't know the specific term, but my therapist and I talked about ""patterns"" and ""reenacting"" them so essentially the same thing. It made a painful amount of sense, definitely got lost in some nightmares and occasionally went into denial/dissociation when I learned of the patterns. After, I saw myself following the pattern and getting into a relationship with someone I knew I shouldn't, knowing full well what was going to happen, but I did it anyways. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of work to break the patterns, or at least it did for me. It's not flipping a light switch, it's learning a new way to be. 

Take your time with it, breathe through it, don't force yourself mentally process or try to fix it all at once. It will come piece by piece. Get some rest, it beats the hell out of you for sure."
BipolarReddit,fncsqyr,t3_g0yqh5,1586845990.0,"So I'm going to paste what I said last time someone made an identical post in r/mentalillness.

I feel you're anger and you have every right to be upset, but I'd encourage you to take a step back for a moment.

I don't mean to defend the statements made in that sub, especially because I don't know which specific ones you're referring to, but I'd encourage you to look at the history and larger context here.

Checkout the Rosenhan experiment[Rosenhan experiment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment) if you haven't to yet. Mental health treatment doesn't have a spotless track record. And looking back at how same-sex attraction/relationships were regarded up until very recently, you can see how sometimes the field can pathologize things that are very normative. 

Similarly, the way our insurance/diagnostic system is set up doesn't always reflect real world understandings. For instance, grief and depressed mood after losing a loved one can be diagnosed as clinical depression if it lasts more than 2 weeks. If you ask anyone how long it takes to heal from losing someone you care about, you know it takes more than two weeks, but that diagnostic criteria is put in place so that people can receive a diagnosis and treatment that will then be covered by insurance, etc. 

In general, the diagnostic system was built more around researching and providing administrative coverage/funding for treating different conditions. So when people receive diagnoses, they can appear very alien because they don't seem to reflect their real experiences. They can feel more like abstract labelling that was designed to motivate funding/resource allocation, because that's legitimately where that language came from.

Another big issue has to do with poorly explained medication plans, over-medication/side-effects, and lack of access to high quality care. Personally, when I started treatment for the first time, I was only allowed to see a psychiatrist and he provided no talk therapy whatsoever. He tried out tons of different medications, increased doses 4 times the recommended amount when I was only 14, had me blacking out on a regular basis because of how intoxicated I was on the drugs, made me chemically dependent on sleeping pills, misdiagnosed me as depressed when I am bipolar and gave me medication that induced horrendous manic episodes, etc. That psychiatrist was terrible and I am still afraid of psychiatrists to this day because of how awful the experience was with him. 

When people don't have access to more in depth talk therapy where they can feel understood, when their diagnoses feel alien, and the medication they're prescribed isn't properly explained and/or produces adverse outcomes/side-effects, I would not blame them at all for being antipsychiatry.

Additionally, there are plenty of terrible psychiatrists out there, just browse r/TalkTherapy for a while and you'll see how many inappropriate and terrible therapists there are as well.

When I see that community, I see people that don't feel understood by the larger mental health system. And the system has lots of problems and not all clinicians are great, so there are many justifiable and reasonable complaints that can be made. But yes, at the same time, in a subreddit community where memes and outlandish content are the most popular things, it can become more toxic than healthy.

If you ban them, they'll just find another corner of the internet and likely become more extreme. I personally try to regard people from that subreddit with compassion and understanding even though I disagree with them."

TalkTherapy,fkmxswx,t3_fjfyw2,1584344389.0,"Generally speaking, therapist disclosure can be used in order help people feel more comfortable, less alone, and better supported. 

After detailing my sexual abuse history, at one point, obviously not during a particularly heavy moment, my T disclosed that she's also had similar experiences. And in my mind, it meant that she got it, she understood it, I didn't have to keep trying to communicate the palpability and heaviness of the emotions I was feeling, she knew.

My T has also lightly shared drug use history but not in an emotional or deep way, just a casual comment essentially indicating that she's no stranger to the topic and/or experiences.

The times when disclosure is bad is when it puts emotional weight on you, when it takes away from your time to discuss your issues, when it impacts the therapists ability to be emotionally present and listen to you, and when it makes you uncomfortable. 

I have found that most folks on Reddit are pretty critical of therapist disclosure but I believe it's a very valuable tool when used well and appropriately."

TalkTherapy,fjpka19,t1_fjp1vby,1583553079.0,"So that's a tricky question to answer. I feel like I have built a much more authentic trust with my current therapist, but when I saw the other therapists, I was much younger and I don't think I would have fully trusted anyone at that point, no matter who was in the chair across from me. It's a situation where you have to be ready and want to trust someone, you can't just will it into existence.

I think what you might be asking here has more to do with being comfortable being open with them. I had one therapist that I didn't feel comfortable being open with until it was our last session and I told her I didn't think anything we did helped at all. Some of my most groundbreaking moments in therapy have actually come from moments like that now that I mention it, where you drop all limitations and just let them have it, whatever it is you got held up. Sometimes the relationship between you and the therapist is actually where you work out most of your shit.

Anyways, the heart of your question, I find that it takes a while. Even if you have tons in common with someone and get along great, it's hard to dive in to you deepest and most personal stuff. My first therapists, I would say I ""trusted"" them pretty quickly actually, but back then I didn't really know what I wanted out of my mental health treatment or what kind of treatment was good or bad. But as I've grown older and been through more of it, I'm much more selective about who I share myself with and how. At the same time, when I was younger, I trusted them but I wasn't 100% honest/open. Now I trust and I am honest/open. So it took significantly longer to build but it's been a much deeper and rewarding trust."

TalkTherapy,fjms2jl,t3_fe9ilu,1583481439.0,"I would say it's very normal to have this kind of feeling. The times when you should worry are when you start to have breakdowns about it. There were times where I felt like I was ripping my face off during sessions and when I got home it was just sheer panic about what came out and how do I get back to normal. In those types of instances, it's really good to bring it up and make sure you are going at a healthy pace with enough scaffolding in the relationship. 

All that being said, yes it's common and is often a good thing. Therapy is never 100% comfortable. I am 100% comfortable with my therapist, but the things that we talk about I'm not. But that's what it's meant for, being a safe space for talking about things you can't elsewhere and whatnot."

If you have all 3 of those, they are likely to take it very seriously and to do their job, they may suggest or require inpatient treatment (doesn't necessarily need to be at a hospital per se). 

Genuinely, if you do have all 3 and it's an immediate possibility, it might be good to spend some time in a safe space where you can ask these questions and work through this with people trained to talk about it.

You can definitely share your thoughts about pros and cons when you bring it up, but they will probably not engage in that discussion unless there are opportunities to talk about something deeper in the points that you bring up. 

They may also want to talk about why you want to discuss pros and cons, as in there may be a deeper part of you hoping that in that conversation, someone will be able to talk you out of it in a logical and coherent way.

I've definitely had conversations with my therapist about suicide, but we talked more in terms of what it would mean and why. And I think that kind of conversation can be really important and better than arguing about pros and cons. 

In general though, I think it would be a good idea to talk to someone and I sincerely hope that you do."
TalkTherapy,fdngrb0,t3_em883p,1578585464.0,"I take off my shoes when I get there. If I don't I act like a fundamentally different person. To break the ice, I also shared my art with my therapist, short stories and photography. I shared music that means a lot to me too. Also, I struggled talking about heavier stuff at first so there were tons of time where I would write up a long note and email it to her. Sometimes we would talk about it, other times it was just a way to make her aware and get to know me better.

I didn't want to do this but one time my therapist suggested going for a walk and doing our session outside. Personally, that would make it harder for me to focus and open up, would also feel anxious about who might be around, but I could also see how it might break the ice."
TalkTherapy,fd16yek,t1_fd0lz8e,1578128130.0,"It takes time and you need to feel safe to access those emotions. When I first heard that, I thought, of course I'm safe, but then after digging into it, I found that on a deeper level I didn't feel safe accessing those emotions at all.

First, I needed to feel confident that my therapist could handle my heavier moments and feelings, even if I get angry towards her. Then, I needed to have confidence in myself to be able to feel the emotions and know that the world wasn't going to end. For the longest time, I felt like if I let the feelings come through, I would break down, fall apart, and never come back together. It felt catastrophic and terrifying. Still does a lot of the time, and for good reason too. When I let them out, I need multiple days to recuperate. 

Anyways, after that, it was a matter of pulling off the mask, which can be more difficult than you expect. The laughter is a learned habit that has probably accumulated over many years. For me, the first few times I started to take it off, it felt like it was a constant effort that I had to re-engage over and over throughout the session to stop the laughter. I would alternate between laughing and crying/breaking down in really rapid succession. I felt like I was losing it and is was because I was letting go of the rigid control I was keeping on those buried emotions. 

Over time, taking off the mask has gotten easier. It's less drawn out and less debilitating, but it's still a challenge."
TalkTherapy,fcyshen,t3_ejj8bu,1578086119.0,"I do it all the time, particularly when my T asks a question or when I say something that brings up a mountain of pain/memories/emotions. It's an easy way to let it brush off of you very quickly without having to deal with it too much. But once you start to put the laughter aside, you might find a lot of deep emotions underneath.

It's perfectly natural, but it can be a strong defense mechanism that's difficult to get over without addressing it directly."
TalkTherapy,fc7nqmy,t3_egn0g8,1577513630.0,"I do all the time, nearly every time I go.

Like she'll tell me she's in the middle of grading exams or that she just took her dog to the vet. Some people on this sub may call that too much self-disclosure, but I disagree. It really helps me relate to her and feel comfortable talking with her.

Also, don't worry about you crossing boundaries, that's the therapist's job. If you cross a boundary, they should make that perfectly clear and it would need to be extreme and/or repeatedly crossing boundaries to warrant terminating a relationship with a client, so I wouldn't worry about that.

I've definitely nudged that boundary on occasion, but it's not a big deal at all. She just says something like ""well remember this is YOUR therapy session ...""  and we move on."

Psychiatry,fbqfabn,t3_ee5iov,1577031154.0,"The simple reason is that psychiatric abuse and over-medication are rampant both in history and today.

When people need someone to just listen, lots of psychiatrists don't. They just think about what medication will address the symptom without really interacting with the human in front of them.

People often go into psychiatric treatment because they don't have another option, because they're facing very extreme symptoms, or because they were taught not the value or believe in psychotherapy. Folks don't typically appreciate what medications are supposed to do (i.e., have misguided expectations) or what it means to go on them (i.e., how it will affect their life in a deeper and more long-term sense). 

Medications are also marketed and prescribed as if they will resolve your life for you, but that's not really the case. Even the portion of psychiatrist that explain it well (additional treatment beyond medication is likely needed and there are both short term and long term aspects of medications that need to be discussed), it doesn't mean that the client will be receptive and reflective on the information. The psychiatrist may do everything right and the client can still leave hating them."

Depending on your topic, tracking down special issues of journals can also be very helpful.

Depending on your focus, this may not be relevant, but I try to pull in other relevant disciplines and frameworks. You can read lots of data analysis on specific factors and experiments, but then reading an ethnographic study can really embody the work and provide more context and grounding. Can also include philosophy/ethics, sociology, public health, etc. The different disciplines usually use different terms to refer to the same thing so it can be exhausting but my favorite research I've ever done incorporates lots of perspectives.

MMA_Academy,f7kpzb5,t3_dwn05d,1573822140.0,"On your form: Your hands drop all the time and you were consistently open for counters but the guy in grey was more concerned with practicing head movement and evading it seems. Keep your hands up. Practice throwing a punch while keeping your other hand up, and returning bak to your guard quickly and easily. 

Also on form: You're leaning forward too much. Anyone with more of a Muay Thai/kickboxing background would stop you in your tracks with leg kicks and teeps. In general, this comes with experience and practice, but work on footwork, agility, and balance. Do ladder drills, practice the Ali Shuffle and make sure to keep your weight and chest over your hips and over your feet. 

On your sparring: Your approach is a little predictable. Try leading into encounters with different strikes or following the same strike with a different one. Lead with a left uppercut followed by a right kick. Lead with a left inside low kick followed by a right cross. Etc. Learn to mix in different combinations and mix it up between low kicks, strikes to the body, and head. You'll find a lot more openings that way.

Lastly, when someone is doing that much head movement, just fake a few punches and kick them hard in the legs or body. That shit gets annoying fast and the way to resolve it is not throwing more punches, particularly if they're good at head movement. Just trap them with fakes and whatnot."

Career_Advice,f6mbwip,t3_dryer4,1572970165.0,"It's illegal to discriminate against a job applicant if they list themselves as disabled in the US, so saying yes should not hurt your chances at all here. If it does, that's illegal and the employer should be sued/taken to court.

In practical terms, if you do select yes, you will be able to claim your disability for a leave from your job for a defined period of time. Personally, I am bipolar and I say yes to that question because if I ever need inpatient hospitalization, my leave from work would be covered by my disability, they could not fire me and I would not lose my vacation or sick days.

mentalillness,f5zvrrw,t3_dpwmom,1572590563.0,"I mean ... I could list all my strategies for healthy self-care but I don't think that's what you're looking for. 

In terms of getting through pain, I used to rely on any coping mechanism that dulled the pain, even the bad ones like substances, self-harm, hypersexuality, etc. Through traumatic events in my life, I learned to dissociate and cut myself off from my feelings. This was helpful for surviving when I was younger and getting through the worst of it, but now that I'm living on my own and doing my best to function, it gets in the way of friendships/relationships, and maintaining mental stability. The more I dissociate, the more I experience flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares, manic/depressive episodes, etc. 

One thing I used to say to myself was that sleeping was a reset button. No matter what pain I was feeling, if I could just get through it enough until the evening and I could sleep and wake up again, I would have made it to the next day where I could try again and hope at the very least that it would be a less painful day.

At the heart of it was having the smallest of goals and expectations. Can I eat this meal? Can I get up and go to the bathroom? Can I shower without falling apart? Can I go 5 minutes without thinking about suicide? Can I talk to someone and relate to them, even if it's just talking about the weather? I latched on to the smallest things and eventually started using them like building blocks. Sounds cheesy but it's true."
Psychiatry,f5xtg9j,t1_f5xp5aq,1572545999.0,"I agree, modality plays a huge role in this type of commentary. Depth is more important in some treatment models than others.

In terms of 'self-awareness' ... I think you're missing the point. The idea is that in therapy, you are deeply vulnerable with another person, particularly in depth-oriented treatments. It's important to experience that yourself if you intend to utilize depth-oriented modalities in your work as a clinician. You have to understand what it takes to go there so that you can respect and attune to people when they are vulnerable with you. Granted -- this is definitely a value/belief, not some law or rule. I am not arguing that this should be required. All that I am saying is that I believe this is good practice. (Also why I used the word ""consider"" in my first comment.)

And on the last point -- yes time, money, and availability are factors. If you do get into a program, then ideally they provide health insurance for graduate and medical students, University counseling centers, and your clinical supervisors can also be people where this dynamic can be developed."
ptsd,f5vm0oa,t3_dpe0sm,1572492691.0,"Sounds a lot like what happens to me when I dissociate. Personally, I end up dissociating a lot during therapy sessions, but it's the best time for me to identify it and work on it because it's not always easy to notice it outside of therapy and obviously because my therapist is there.

Talk to your clinician about it, they should learn to recognize what dissociation looks like when it happens to you and talk to you about it while it's happening. That way they can help bring you back down to a more grounded feeling. 

I will admit, the first time I started talking about dissociating and really dug into it at therapy, I started to have some nervous breakdowns and panicked moments. When I became self-aware of the dissociative moments as they were happening, it felt like my reality was breaking in a way, like incompatible worlds were colliding. 

I only say this because dissociative symptoms, particularly when related to trauma, can carry a ton of pain and significance. So be sure to take care of yourself, do all of the things that are good for you and talk to whomever you need to as you work through this stuff. It can be scary but it's also a very powerful moment for healing."
Psychiatry,f5uhwox,t3_dp89jz,1572473599.0,"Make sure you research the differences between the paths and responsibilities between psychiatrists, psychologists, counselors, etc. For a while, I thought I wanted to be a psychiatrist but after getting to undergrad, I realized I was not interested in getting an MD. I studied neuroscience and plenty of biopsychology, but I wished I didn't bother with the college courses in chemistry, organic chemistry, and physics.

Look into financials too -- cost of program, how long before you're making an income that can sustain you, how old will you be by that point, etc.

Look into expected GPAs, acceptance rates, and admissions criteria. This stuff will be intimidating for sure, but you need to set expectations for yourself.

And most importantly, get some experience. Volunteer at a homeless shelter and start learning what it's like to talk to people during emotional crises. Volunteering at a crisis call center is also a popular one but I personally preferred interacting with people in person rather than over the phone.

Also, consider starting to see a therapist yourself. My therapist once told me that she doesn't believe in asking clients to go deeper than she had gone in her own therapy. It's important to know what the experience is like for yourself so you know how to work with others in that situation."
ptsd,f5sgf7c,t3_dp1hde,1572429071.0,"Same. I used to have terrible insomnia. It took hours to sleep, I'd wake up in the middle of the night and hours early. It took me a lot of therapy to realize that it was largely caused by hypervigilance because of my fear of my terrible, recurring nightmares and losing control of my depressive cycles. I couldn't let go of my thoughts and let myself fall asleep because I was afraid of not being in control. Still working on this today and struggling to sleep right now haha that was the hypervigilance I really struggled to recognize

It carried over to my day to day life too with fear of losing my mind with manic/depressive episodes and dissociating instead of allowing myself to feel deep emotions for fear of losing control. It turns into this rigid hypervigilance where I use anger, dissociation, physical exercise, substances, etc., to keep out danger coming from feelings/thoughts within me.

I do have some hypervigilance around other people too, but for me that's always been a bit more obvious because they're super conscious thoughts for me about escape plans, what would I do, how would I handle this. I would walk around and wonder, if I had to fight this person what would I do? Like I was constantly preparing to be in a struggle with everyone around me. 

It's a powerful thing to realize and see how hypervigilance plays a role in your day to day life, particularly because it'll show up in so many different ways."
mentalillness,f58yz5u,t3_dn6e14,1572067750.0,"I think one of the best places you could start would be by just telling them exactly what you're saying here -- you feel scared to fully open up. Then you can start talking about the idea of opening up without necessarily having to do it. Confronting it like that can be hard but it can also help your clinician/doctor better recognize your needs and have an opportunity to make you feel more comfortable and safer in talking about those things.

Also, as one of the other commenters mentioned, getting comfortable in their office is very helpful. Personally, I see a mental health counselor and when I go I take off my shoes everytime and end up sitting cross-legged or just holding my legs close to me. In moments where I'm talking about something really heavy I will curl up in a ball and sometimes even keep her out of sight because I can't handle looking at her. 

I also write things out before I go see my therapist. I keep them in a note on my phone. Sometimes I write the note like it's just me talking to me and other times I write it as if I'm speaking directly to her. I'll bring the notes and if I want to talk about them I can look at them and bring it all up. Other times I will look at the notes and decide I don't want to talk about them.

But when it's really powerful dissociation, it can be hard to do that.

TalkTherapy,f40ctbu,t3_dj14yj,1571294035.0,"I felt that way with a number of psychologists/psychiatrists when I originally started treatment and that helped me realize what kind of clinician I want to see. In my experience, people that are overly stringent on science/evidence-based methods will tend to care more about the numbers and ratings and diagnostic measures than your experience as a human being. If those numbers get better that's all they care about. I occasionally tested that when I was young and would lie in those tests and I often found that to be the case. And if you're interested in reducing specific symptomology then that can be great for you 

But after some experience, I know I need to find someone I trust, someone that treats me like a human being, someone that's humble enough to know that we are going to be figuring out things together. It's a collaborative process, not dictator and follower.

Don't ignore this feeling. Find someone you'll feel comfortable with and that will treat you well. You'll be spending a lot of time with them talking about the most sensitive topics, you should definitely try to find someone you trust and like as a person."

The key is to stay light on your feet during the switch, always on the balls of your feet, and keep your chest and head up.

ptsd,f0o6uxy,t3_d4zelo,1568798785.0,"The trauma didn't necessarily make the change, but I've got multiple tattoos that commemorate what I've been through and what I've needed to do to survive.

It's not the same thing at all, but I wanted to share because I find it really healing and helpful to get metaphorical tattoos about surviving and living with trauma. Tattoos are not everyone's cup of tea, but mine serve as reminders to keep fighting, to keep hope alive, and to practice self-acceptance/self-care, etc. They feel like a protective layer between me and the world around me sometimes."
mentalhealth,ev5vzlj,t3_cigexu,1564239414.0,"This exact thing happens to me all the time. Sometimes, if I'm in the car alone, I'll scream about it but most of the time it's a cringe and a twitch, much like you described and then I end up getting angry and trying to stop any feeling that's coming up. It's not necessarily a good thing but I get angry at my self, sort of ""why the hell were you wondering into that memory?"" 

For me, I have a problem with touch (see my post history) and most of the memories that flash like that involve touch (e.g., when I was very drunk one time, I put my arm around a girl I barely knew and I got some awkward looks from her friends. She didn't really stop me or seem too uncomfortable by it. I ended up blacking out most of the rest of the night but I know that girl and I didn't do anything and I'm glad we didn't. It's all very cringy. This particular memory has flashed for me several times.)

Sometimes my entire body physically cringes, sometimes I hit myself or squeeze/twist a part of my body. I don't really have any suggestions for ameliorating the situation because I haven't done so myself, but that happens to me at about the same frequency that it happens to you"
ptsd,ev5tc0i,t1_ev47czx,1564238465.0,"Yeah, I used to do Muay Thai religiously and that was helpful for getting used to touch since you're clinching and hitting one another. But the touch was always in the context of fighting and pain, so it was more of what I've been familiar with (i.e., abuse) rather than something that would help me get more comfortable with it. I'm hoping to start jiu jitsu in the future so that should help build at least a little tolerance because there's a lot more touch than Muay Thai. 

Thanks for sharing though, it's good to keep working on ideas for getting used to it in environments where touch isn't necessarily the focus of what's going on. I appreciate it"
ptsd,ev5rl2p,t1_ev47i1q,1564237840.0,"Thanks for sharing, seriously. I suspect I'm going to have a similar experience, but it's good to know you got through it. At this point I just need to keep hope alive that I'll find someone willing to put up with the process. Genuinely, it's very helpful to hear, thanks again"
ptsd,ev45jzz,t1_ev442p4,1564207975.0,"Appreciate it, thanks for the company"
mentalillness,euzikx1,t3_chsoph,1564120310.0,"I've definitely had this before and what you want to call it depends on when it happens and the root of it. Personally, this happens to me when I dissociate and that tends to be in PTSD flare ups and trauma/emotional crises types of moments.

I've also had this happen more as a body dismorphic type of thing. I personally tend to see myself in a very skewed perspective and I'm overly critical and hate myself and all of that stuff, and occasionally I'll catch my reflection when I'm not really paying attention and I look like a completely different person than I'm used to seeing. 

On the other hand, if this is a regular occurrence and there seems to be no cause or root to it, it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk to a professional about it. If you ever experience blackouts or memory loss from these moments or start acting in ways you normally never do, then definitely try to talk to someone. It depends too on how persistent these things are for you -- is it just flashes of sustained periods of time? 

The general rule of thumb is that if you're experiencing symptoms and it's negatively impacting your life, or if you just don't know what's going on and want to figure it out, go see someone."
Existentialism,eu3wvc6,t1_eu3wqnk,1563428313.0,"Also, start simple if you need to. Taking walks is a perfect example. Start trying to do it regularly and after it feels normal to walk a few miles, you might just try jogging a bit. Sometimes people try to just do an overhaul and it ends up shocking their body and they just reject it. I believe in slow and steady improvements"
Existentialism,eu3wqnk,t3_ceo7wf,1563428172.0,"Honestly, exercise is crucial to my mental health. And after doing it for a while and recognizing how much of a positive impact it makes in my life, I learned to enjoy it and think of it as some of my most valued and important time for self-care. I don't beat the hell out of myself just for the sake of ""gains"" or setting personal records like they do in CrossFit. I just exercise to make myself happy and take care of myself. 

Also, looking good and having good physical health are perks. Sometimes you have to try a bit harder for that, but once you have a new normal routine of easy enjoyable exercise, it's just a matter of making small changes over time and before you know it you'll be doing things you never thought you could."
BipolarReddit,eu3sldi,t3_cel7gk,1563424020.0,"Yeah, very relatable. I hid my symptoms from even my psychiatrists and therapists. It wasn't until I finally started talking about them that I actually got the bipolar diagnosis. My friends and family have no idea I have a history of self harm, hearing voices, dissociative blackouts, or PTSD. I tell them life has been rough for me lately and they think it's trouble at work. They've got no idea I feel like I'm on the edge of losing my sanity.

Thankfully I'm doing better than I have in years and the therapist I finally opened up to was very receptive and whatnot. 

Anyways, yes I totally do the same thing. Makes it really awkward when you do talk about it, but it can also be really powerful for both you and for people who have no idea or misconceptions about mental health and bipolar."
BipolarReddit,es8k7dj,t3_c6eq08,1561701008.0,"I've been at 150mg for 2 months or so. They had me try to go up to 200mg at one point but I started developing a rash on my legs and the rash side effect can get serious so they bumped me back down to 150 and the rash went away in a couple days. It started the day after I went up to 200, and went away two days after I went back to 150. Wasn't a big deal.

In terms of the actual psychological stuff --- it has definitely taken the edge off. My moods still swing but not as bad as they used to. I find that when my mood swings and I want to fall into the old habits and coping mechanisms, I don't NEED to use those methods and habits like I used to. It didn't completely change me or get rid of everything, but it gave me an option to do something about my life. Before it was just survival and needing to do what I had to do, but now it's learning to take care of myself and make healthier decisions.

That being said, it's not as great at curbing the manic symptoms. The manic stuff has died down a bit because I'm better at taking care of myself, but I know the mania could still take over and run amuck if I let it. I do have more control over it than I used to though."
