writers,fou86bf,t1_fou7wd8,1588078626.0,My publishers are not giving me my fair share. I'm 22 and I decided to start my life as a writer because I'm going to take a course on cinema. I want to be a professional writer of scripts and novels and I already published a book but like I said my publishers are dicks and I haven't seen any income yet and it's already been a year.
BPD,fm4g1u0,t3_fsokrf,1585753422.0,"It's really hard especially when you now pushing people away is a bad costume of yours. I never felt pushing people away was bad specially because I think I will be more safe that way, but in your case it's actually rather difficult and hard for you to handle. We are not bad, this disease makes us think that but we are acting in impulse. Take a deep breath and try to be more conscious of your actions. If you think your pushing yourself away because those people are not worth it thats a thing, but I see you spoke about your husband. Have you tried listening to him and what he as to say? If you did try not take that as an insult and try to take that as a work for yourself to improve. This is easier said than done because I also feel I am to stubborn sometimes and criticism takes me hard. Just try to do your best, your not a bad person believe me or I would be a bad person as well. Focus on the symptoms of BPD and try to discern them from what you are as a person.
I hope this helps and sorry if I am miss judge you in some way, I'm trying my best. Wish you the best of luck."

Writting is my passion, I've been writting since I was little but somehow never got through the structure part that is really important, also I struggle a lot with gramatic. I started to read Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre to give me some insight of english grammer and enrich myself more, why do I want to write a story in english if I'm not native? Well, english is a passionate language, you can fall in love with its nuances very quickly, don't think I'm insulting my language but I also always struggled with it. It's an hard time to express ourselves in paper when people in the end don't understand what you're saying so it makes me sad.
I will think of your words as more wisdom to myself and I will practice learning tolerance with myself. We, as humans, are never perfect but we sure do things that are perfection, and I sure read perfect works of art but also that's me trying to compare myself to another person that as been through life in a different way then myself, I can't do that, that work is his/her perfection and on the other hand that author might have thought, or still thinks, that is work is not perfect as well.
Patience then. 😁"

Feeling depressed and having depression are two completely different things, I still suffer from major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder, I just wanted to make this clear for anybody that feels offended, not you specifically. I started to write a story in english and I'm not native but I thought after writting the first few pages ""Hey, I'm not that bad!"". I showed that draft in a facebook group for some opinions and people told me that was very confusing and not fluid, besides I had many mistakes spelling. I begin to remember that I had the same comments in my native language. Is it my style of writting or are those really mistakes? I started to believe in the later and thats why I ended up here.

Just like my psychiatrist said as she draw two circles, one around the little one that represented me and the small representing my emptiness. Since we can't make that emptiness go away we need to make a bigger circle in our lifes to at least diminish the emptiness.
As we are talking I'm going to tell you, a few months ago I was tired of my life and I was feeling useless as I was trying to find a job, and I finally found it. I'm not trying to be to shabby, but I think I'm doing well at it, even though I only started two weeks ago. I started to feel really happy cause everytime I got out of my job I had the foundedness of doing and helping more around the house, but today I woke up with fear I don't know why!

The first week was awful, the meds made me have panic attacks, constantly, and I couldn't sleep for five days but once you get used to it, it really improves you, but in this battle the meds don't only count but also our own effort at trying to move forward. I was once in a pit like yourself feeling this would never pass, and believe me I still have bpd to this day because its a cronical illness, we just have to learn to leave with it even though some days feel worse then others. Be strong and move forward for a better recovery and allways think of yourself first and what is best for you, but if it's about suicidal thougths get some help immediately.
