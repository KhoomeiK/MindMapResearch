drugscirclejerk,eztb0j9,t1_ezt1p06,1568125987.0,"There is a heroin and fentanyl problem. Im not saying that is the party culture. Obviously it isnt, just a lot of people die from it. 

Bath salts as in a cheaper synthetic designer drug. Yes a lot of mdma is sold as what it is but also a lot isnt. There is a documentary where the guys go to several festivals around the states and test peoples drugs. It turns out MOST of the mdma that people were adament was mdma, was bath salts. One dude bought 4000$ worth. Perhaps that has changed over the years but i doubt it. Thats why i test my drugs. Every festival should have harm reduction and testers."

HumansBeingBros,ezrwini,t1_ezqh8pl,1568079745.0,There is a guy in my community who is a local legend. His name is dancing dan and I see him a regular basis dancing his way around the city. At first i thought he was tweeked out but turns out its just something he enjoys doing.
drugscirclejerk,ezrtmh7,t1_ezrsmus,1568078632.0,"If anything america has a huge heroin problem. They have the most overdose deaths from wealthy nations. Also a lot of the drugs in the states are not what they are sold as. A large percentage of the molly is bath salts.

tifu,ezfaadm,t3_d0qk8b,1567875066.0,I feel your pain man. On my birthday this summer i got black out drunk. I dont remember any of this but this girl i was seeing was sending me nudes on snapchat. I sent here some back but also posted them to my story. I woke up super hunger over to my brother calling me saying to check my snapchat. I was horrified to say the least. The only way to go about it was to laugh it off. Apperently im a legend now and some my friends had a similar story. Shit happens man. When i went downstairs i seen i had drank a shit tonne of beers and ate a whole bag of eddibles after golfing and going for my birthday supper.
Psychonaut,ezf26fu,t1_ezejldc,1567872030.0,Wow thats a complete rip off. I just paid 250$ for 1/4 lbs. I wouldnt pay more than 140$ an O and even then thats expensive.
AskReddit,ezasry0,t1_eza659w,1567806957.0,You make a really good point. There is no fail safe to stop you for getting deeper and deeper into the addiction. Its a slippery slope to bankrupcy. I think everyone knows a gambling addict in their lives.

AskReddit,ez8esu8,t1_ez87qx0,1567741325.0,That is sad af. I think gambling addiction could be far harder to quit than hard drugs or smoking.
AskReddit,ez8dbua,t3_d072nh,1567740219.0,"I went to the casino with a friend after he won 2500$ the night before. As soon as we get into the casino we go to the high limit slots room. Within less than 5 minutes i watched him dump all his previous night winnings into one machine. Until then i didnt know that you could bet 125$ a spin. I was tempted to throw 100$ in considering it was bound to hit eventually, but i value my money to much to blow 100$ for 1 spin. Genarally i'll cap myself at 200$ and if i get a couple hours out of that, then to me its not much different than going to a bar and blowing a few hundy on drinks."

Im going to try for one month and see how it goes. It will be tough i think at the beginning, since ive been so addicted to it over the years. Sticking to just reddit"

My friend had to take a month off work to go through therapy to deal with a workplace death she was involved in. I feel the same way tho. I want to die but i wouldnt commit suicide because of the damage i would do to my family."

Drugs,etkt0tn,t3_cc0963,1562907651.0,What didnt work with the ayahuasca for you? Ive read a lot of stories that it can help addicts. A year of doing aya seems like it would have been a healthy journey.
