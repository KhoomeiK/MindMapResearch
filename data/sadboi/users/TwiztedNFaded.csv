depression,fqls8kb,t3_gjml5v,1589465086.0,"Im 15, got back from the psych ward two weeks ago.

Don't tell her anything that would invalidate her pain. My parents told mw for years that i have nothing to be depressed about and it fucked me up, making me avoid getting help. (I actually turned out to be bipolar, which is something i cant help and will live with for the rest of my life.) 

Don't treat her like she will snap at any moment, don't treat her like shes weak and cant handle herself. My parents did that after i got back. It made me feel alienated and just out of place in my own house.

Support her but don't bombard her, and allow her to have space but don't let her spend all day alone. 

You obviously care for your daughter. Remind her that you love her and that you are there to talk to. Maybe give her a speacial present or something. She's probably scared, being in a psych ward is definitely different and makes you feel crazy sometimes. Good luck and don't feel guilty about it, you most likely didn't know about her pain."
