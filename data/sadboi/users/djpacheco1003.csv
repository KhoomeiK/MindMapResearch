NBA2kMTselling,fkxrd38,t3_flbrv3,1584633936.0,About to pm!
Conservative,fddz74q,t1_fddyzdw,1578327525.0,Ok boomer. I'm 21 and in college. What does wanting to talk to people who were my age have to do with this?
Conservative,fdd34ee,t1_fdd2okk,1578292838.0,"I agree that HE deserved it, I'm just saying the country itself deserves better. Like think about the worst most criminal American you know. Imagine another country shot a missile at him on US soil. Sure he deserved it but it would still be an attack on us that WE didn't deserve."
Conservative,fdd2ko3,t1_fdd2703,1578292237.0,So what if they don't stand a chance? They're their own nation and we can't go killing their negotiators. Can we kill terrorists? Sure. Can we commit perfidy? No.
Conservative,fdd1zxu,t1_fdd1v4g,1578291615.0,"It was wrong to kill him. He was operating under the pretense of negotiations. I'm all for killing terrorist, but was it worth risking a war and possibly creating a thousand to replace him? Sorry if I came off as argumentative."
Conservative,fdd1siy,t1_fdd1if4,1578291388.0,Nobody said he was a good dude. The way we killed him was just wrong. Chief.
NoStupidQuestions,fcwmrlp,t1_fcwmoch,1578030054.0,That's the spirit of conversation I'm looking for. A place where we can put nationalism aside and just have conversations as people.
NoStupidQuestions,fcwl5g2,t1_fcwktqg,1578028671.0,"I don't. I've had conversations with a few Iranians so far and have a vague understanding of their point of view, I just meant opposing sides as in a different opinions or views. I definitely don't support a war of any kind."
NoStupidQuestions,fcwis5t,t1_fcwii56,1578026742.0,Thanks for the suggestion!! I honestly want to hear as many opinions as possible anyways
NoStupidQuestions,fcwhptu,t1_fcwhm6l,1578025919.0,"No you're definitely right. I wasn't trying to say there isn't valuable discussions there at all, it's just that it would probably be lost in a sea of people shouting over each other."
NoStupidQuestions,fcwhcxk,t1_fcwhbe2,1578025653.0,Sounds like a good place for intelligent conversations lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc78wjc,t1_fc78vqj,1577500634.0,It's terrible.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc72rre,t3_egjj71,1577495993.0,You can choose to use moss at any time. The other team can choose not to throw at deion.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc6vvt2,t1_fc6vtrc,1577490844.0,That's actually a really cool idea!
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc6vt4q,t1_fc6vdza,1577490788.0,This imo. He just manages to make plays that honestly shouldn't.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc6mj1c,t3_egf73z,1577484102.0,Aaron Rodgers release allows me to throw streaks into double coverage because they don't have time for picks. Like even if I miss the pass there's not enough time for a clean animation. If you even think about usering I'll just use identifier and audible to a slant and throw a pass that gets to the reciever in 0.02 seconds.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc4nalx,t3_eg3mpe,1577421787.0,"I'd personally rework the powerup system. Make it so any specific card above 88 gets one set ability, 92 gets 2 set abilities, and 96 gets three set abilities. Have the powerups be  versions of those cards that you upgrade with stats similar to pat tillman, and as a bonus when you reach the required levels you get to choose your abilities, rather than have the card set them. This gives added value to powerups while also preventing cards prices being so dependent on each other. If it worked this way we wouldn't have a 91 bo selling for twice the price of his 95 card."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc131gj,t3_efljp3,1577306825.0,I may not be able to eat in real life but you better believe I'll be eating on the field!
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0tiib,t3_efjykq,1577299287.0,Hoping marshawn Lynch wins Superbowl mvp just so I can tell my kids the story someday
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0jer4,t1_fc0iunl,1577292156.0,"I might have sniped two since it was so early. 
But if Vick goes up to 600k I might sell him and re roll the set. Doing some quick math off the top of my head I think you could make 5k kindling from quickselling the nats and using the 600k for the other two players. It depends how much the 95's go for though"
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0ievp,t3_efif42,1577291530.0,"Well the Vick set costs a total of around 650k.
You get all three players nat and the Vick sells for 550k. 

So you're essentially getting Micheal Strahan, Mel Blount, and 95 bo Jackson for 150k.

💰"
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0e8zl,t3_efhu0g,1577288447.0,Check your unopened packs
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0dcep,t1_fc0d0ve,1577287635.0,"I think he meant if you can afford backups for almost every position, which I never really understood. Like the total cost I'd have to pay to make sure my backups are good enough to play is insane."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fc0bdv6,t3_efgr08,1577285840.0,Paul Krause. I remember having him whichever year he had an oop cb card and nothing's ever felt so right. It's just so satisfying getting an interception with Paul Krause!
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbzm9wg,t1_fbzfm7g,1577251556.0,"Honestly you don't even need the best guys. With things like c4ds2 and double enforcer, most cheese cancels out. Even if it didn't, so what? It's not like you can't get the offensive players yourself. There doesn't necessarily have to be a 50/50 split between offense and defense."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbye5cq,t3_ef59ld,1577214626.0,87 Johnathan Abram. He's a strong safety but just put him there and have him as backup ss. Afaik he's the cheapest enforcer and he has 90 speed.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fby7d1i,t3_ef3p26,1577209870.0,"If Aaron Rodgers gets a card he's my #1 option. I'm loving his release. Add gunslinger, potential escape artist, and dashing deadeye and he becomes my favorite card in the game."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fby6gak,t3_ef3pbx,1577209242.0,A little more than the price but I'd go with 93 mike evans. I have a good defense already but I could see him being a game changer for lower overalls.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbx8rpk,t1_fbx5gju,1577174548.0,That's actually such a cool idea! Or maybe they have some sort of system that makes you pick one of the coach suggestions every couple of plays? But that might be problematic because the ai can be pretty dumb sometimes
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbwl33o,t3_eeto56,1577152769.0,F for everyone telling me Rodgers had no shot
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbv1z6j,t1_fbuwrte,1577124082.0,Lmao I get what you're saying. Not sure what they're being so literal for.
nfl,fbtrg8a,t1_fbtq5ys,1577091862.0,Yea I'm the one trying to think of ways that Rodgers COULD make it over Brees and that's not even a potential reason to me. That's ridiculous.
nfl,fbtr7l9,t1_fbtr3zs,1577091498.0,"Of course I'm not. I'm suggesting that the NFL voters who don't think Terrell Owens was top 10 will vote that way. All time I have Rodgers 9th. I have Brees anywhere from 3-5.

We literally didn't have a running back from the 21st century make the list. I don't think they're using the most logical arguments here."
nfl,fbtqwi7,t1_fbtqthu,1577091030.0,"I'm not entirely expecting to be upvoted, I just came here to get a better understanding of their careers. I genuinely appreciate the comment explanation though. Troy aikman is my favorite QB of all time if it makes a difference, for sentimental reasons though."
nfl,fbtqtox,t1_fbtqnh6,1577090915.0,"This is essentially the argument I could see the NFL 100 voters making. Not that I personally would apply that logic to their entire careers, but the entire point of the post was that they could see it that way."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtqps7,t1_fbtqooa,1577090750.0,Yea completely slipped my mind while I was making a 30 second list. Must know nothing about the sport then.
nfl,fbtqouq,t1_fbtqic8,1577090711.0,"There is a comment specifically saying that the list was more about careers than talent, and that if it weren't then they'd take Vick over Rodgers. It had 3 likes. So I got the general feeling that people agreed."
nfl,fbtqmne,t1_fbtqiz7,1577090618.0,I'm not saying Rodgers is better. The list completely omitted Terrell Owens so they obviously don't have a completely unbiased view point here. I'm just saying that they could vote it that way. All time I have Brees over Rodgers.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtqhlf,t1_fbtq7jv,1577090409.0,"Just to clarify here's my top 10 for this list only, off the top of my head.

1. Brady
2. Marino
3. Brees
4. Montana
5. Unitas
6. Graham
7. Favre
8. Elway
9. Rodgers
10. Young

So no. Rodgers isn't some mythical being to me. I'm just saying that you could make an argument for any one of these guys to make it above almost any other. It might not be a great argument but there is one."
nfl,fbtq9ee,t1_fbtq5le,1577090068.0,"I'm not saying that he's better than Drew Brees because of 4 passes. That part was directed at the people who legitimately said they'd take Michael Vick on the list over Aaron Rodgers. I'm trying to say that he's not some average qb, he has an arm and he has accuracy on normal passes. That's my fault for not clarifying though."
nfl,fbtq5s7,t1_fbtq36f,1577089920.0,"Honestly not gonna argue this. Like I said I don't know how too much about the league standings and position rankings, so I fully admit I was wrong on that point."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtq0tg,t1_fbtpynu,1577089715.0,"I wasn't saying he was better. I don't know enough to say that, I argued he could make the list. This list is not a direct indicator of talent or career. There's multiple factors the voters look at and I'm just saying that they could put Rodgers over Brees."
nfl,fbtpy2c,t1_fbtpx17,1577089603.0,Let me rephrase. Pressure throws. As in he only sets up drives then just falls apart in the endzone.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtpway,t1_fbtpu67,1577089531.0,I didn't argue he was better. I argued he could make the list. I made a new post if you want to discuss it there though.
nfl,fbtpuxo,t1_fbtpo4w,1577089478.0,"This is the point I'm making with my post. Everyone seemed to think that Rogers had 0% chance of making it, but there's probably 50 QB's who have an argument for the voters."
nfl,fbtprql,t1_fbtpqlr,1577089349.0,That wasn't a stat meant to put Rodgers over Brees. That was just about the comments saying he couldn't make clutch throws when the game mattered.
nfl,fbtpov4,t1_fbtpnd2,1577089230.0,"Noted. I didn't mean that it was more important than Superbowl plays or important drives to set up wins, that was more about the comments saying Aaron Rodgers couldn't make throws that matter."
nfl,fbtpjtn,t1_fbtp4os,1577089029.0,Someone tried to argue that Rodgers had talent but it never amounted to anything. He went on to say that he'd take Michael Vick just based on talent...
nfl,fbtph5c,t1_fbtpfw4,1577088924.0,No shame in being a fan of a player :) Brees is obviously a legend and nothing can change that
nfl,fbtpdu3,t1_fbtp9sk,1577088795.0,Could you see Young making it? Because I got a few comments suggesting he'd make it over Rodgers
nfl,fbtp2uo,t1_fbtp299,1577088358.0,Honestly wouldn't be surprised with these voters lol
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbto5ew,t1_fbtmmb8,1577087057.0,"Look at almost every efficiency record and Rodgers owns it. It's the king of the hail Mary we're talking about. I don't care what the game means, the hail Mary is the most important play because it has the most impact on a game. So he has the efficiency, except for a few specific stats. He has the ""legacy"", he was a Superbowl mvp against the defense allowing the fewest points per game, and he has the edge on personnel.

Rodgers has nearly double rushing yards and touchdowns, higher passing percentages almost universally, almost half the interceptions thrown, a higher career passer rating, and he makes clutch throws as well as anyone in the history of the league.

I'll give Brees the nod on numbers but I can think of plenty of qb's who would've benefitted in today's league. On a per pass basis AR gets 2% more yards with 3% less complete passes, not enough to dismiss Rodgers. 

Michael Thomas himself is 4th in recievjng yards all time for the saints in just 3 years. The closest guy above him took 6 years to get there. The best reciever Rodgers had was Driver, who was great himself, had his top 3 yard per catch seasons before Rodgers was in the league. I can't even imagine what Rodgers would accomplish with someone like Mike on his team.

You could use any of those arguments to make a case that Rodgers belongs above Brees. I'm not saying it's a lock and that there's no debate, but if you're attempting to tell me that there is no case for Rodgers then you're just being ridiculous."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtkuca,t1_fbtkolv,1577082765.0,"He won Superbowl mvp against the Steelers, who had allowed the fewest points per game on the year."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtk3x4,t1_fbthrvz,1577081906.0,I didn't say Brees wasn't top 10. I said Rodgers was better.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtho6n,t1_fbtgs9n,1577079236.0,You could definitely argue he's the most skilled quarterback of all time
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbthi1v,t1_fbthepg,1577079063.0,"I'm not a Rodgers fan and yes. I'm not saying Brees isn't an all time great, but if Terrell Owens misses the list then I think it makes sense"
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbth0ua,t1_fbtgyqu,1577078579.0,Starr or Brees.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtgxzq,t1_fbtgx2e,1577078499.0,I'm not a Rodgers fan
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtfb3h,t1_fbtezhr,1577076925.0,Bruh. Aaron Rodgers is top 10 all time.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtf3w6,t1_fbtep8l,1577076740.0,I think you're wrong though. There are players already named to the team with 1 Superbowl win themselves. What case do you make for Marvin Harrison? He has the same amount of rings and least mvp's.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtenan,t1_fbtemk8,1577076319.0,One question. What's your favorite NFL team?
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtehw0,t1_fbted5t,1577076183.0,Being arguably the most skilled qb of all time does mean something.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtegac,t1_fbteenq,1577076143.0,I'd take Lamar Jackson before Vick if you want to go there
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbtebmk,t1_fbte9bk,1577076031.0,Rodgers is a more talented qb than Brees. I'm pretty sure most people would agree that  he's top 2 all time from a skill standpoint.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbte8aq,t1_fbte5hs,1577075949.0,There's 10 qb's and I don't think EA is necessarily going top 5.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbte4x2,t1_fbte359,1577075868.0,I'd definitely take Aaron Rodgers before Brees. Like 99 times out of 10.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbte1lq,t1_fbte0qs,1577075787.0,Won't get the speed or won't get the card?
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbo580b,t1_fbo52um,1577006999.0,I don't very often. I'm just saying that him beating a defender isn't the way to go so I'm curious how everyone else utilizes him.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbifo37,t1_fbiflm1,1576899638.0,It might be actually. I always assumed that route technician only worked on routes with cuts in them.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbic10e,t3_edk2u6,1576896658.0,For the first two I went with streak specialist and redzone threat. My plan is to just bomb it against any zone coverage and pray the 98 spec can carry me lmao.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbgjyiv,t1_fbghdzi,1576851563.0,"Honestly my favorite play with him is to call cover 2 man, press all corners, and user Tillman. I split between blitzing and playing zone. It's hard to deal with because half the time you have to rush your passes before I get home and the other half I'm there for a lurk."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbem4q2,t1_fbelzr5,1576788761.0,Right? John brown is a monster after the catch
MaddenUltimateTeam,fbeldfg,t1_fbekf28,1576788276.0,Brown is much better stat wise. Especially rac. I'm not saying it's a better card I'm just saying it's close.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb8u7g5,t1_fb8tyf5,1576621989.0,"You sure about that? I have 95 Pat and I never got 250k

Unless you have to finish the start requirements too"
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb7zwk9,t1_fb7zi5x,1576603096.0,"Oh yeah that would definitely work

I don't have him yet, I meant to say I would put him at RE. I didn't know he could get a secondary position."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb7yyd7,t1_fb7yuu8,1576602502.0,"Bruce Smith is still a 95 at LE, and honestly I just put him as a backup RE so he keeps his chems."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb7yvc7,t1_fb7yo8b,1576602448.0,"This is greatly appreciated 🙏

I played 3 already and honestly I've just been calling punt safe man and daring them to throw to Pat Tillman, so far I'm scoring 50-0 usually."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb7js6y,t3_ebw852,1576592103.0,Depends on the game. I go on 24-0 streaks and then out of nowhere it feels like my team forgot how to play football and I go like 7-10. So I'd say I'm a 9/10.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb7g7k5,t3_ebvp96,1576589013.0,"Not sure how good your team is but I have so many extra 80-90 powerup passes left over that I can basically get amari Cooper to 93 overall with 400 training.

I had Julio Jones as my 3rd option and it's nice to get what's essentially a free upgrade."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fb6ztcb,t1_fb6zez6,1576566901.0,Any legend solo on 1 star. Just play the full game and spam sam blitz. If you recover the ball on a fumble just keep spamming laterals until the other team recovers again. If they tackle you before you get the chance to lateral just punt immediately. I usually get like 30 fumbles per game.
MaddenUltimateTeam,fandg2g,t1_fan099q,1576235886.0,"He's got the same speed, meets the juke and spin threshold with powerup, and has 22 higher trucking. His stiff arm also goes up 10.

It's a power back with the speed of Barry Sanders lol."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fakzepp,t1_fak9nsi,1576175705.0,"What?? Recievers are so ridiculously underpowered rn. It's so rare for someone to make a contested catch for me, and every safety in the game feels like oop Moss."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fafojbr,t1_fady2bn,1576027953.0,I can screenshot my record if it makes you feel any better about the skill of a complete stranger
MaddenUltimateTeam,fadrkqf,t1_fadr5le,1575984209.0,"Nah, I know what works and what doesn't."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fadkar5,t1_fadjrxp,1575976098.0,"Yea, honestly I was just messing with him this entire game. He didn't really make any adjustments at all."
MaddenUltimateTeam,fadgq8s,t1_fadgl70,1575970644.0,"Easily the best angle for me lol, it helps me see when deep routes open up.

Almost everyone I talk to irl agrees that this is the best way to play, but I'm curious to hear what you use?

Maybe I'll try it"
shittysuperpowers,fadbn98,t1_fad8skx,1575963246.0,"Late reply but could you not come up with as close to a word for word translation as possible on your own? Like why not just write down all the knowledge of a specific language first then share it. Even though you lose it, there is now a complete understanding of that language."
Sleepparalysis,fachg63,t1_facg6h1,1575939618.0,"I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one! Good luck if you do try it ofc. I don't know if I'm qualified to give tips but what works for me is holding my breath and trying to move my arms. It's kind of hard to tell how long I've been holding because sleep paralysis takes my breath as it is, so I use the ability to move as my tell. Even if I feel like I'm completely out of air I'll keep holding until I can fully sit up."
