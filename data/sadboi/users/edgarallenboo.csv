raisedbynarcissists,ewnfrre,t3_coyhjq,1565576984.0,"My parents have always complained about how awful I am, with literally no basis for that, but I let myself believe it. Any time they speak to friends or family, they literally describe me as a demon and an asshole - to everyone’s horror. They think it’s funny, meanwhile, no one has ever actually described me to be that way. I know for a fact, from home videos and other people’s stories, as well as my own memory, my siblings were fucking horrid. No one ever talks about how I behaved as a baby, because i was actually very quiet. Never fussy, never cried, slept through the night, ate whatever was given to me, and was a a angel. If they ever admit it, they’ll quickly change the subject to some completely normal thing I did later on that they labeled as horrific."
