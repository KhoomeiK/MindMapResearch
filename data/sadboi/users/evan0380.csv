One thing I'm really curious about is the potential relationship between quantum mechanical processes and biochemical/brain processes.

I'd also really like to know whether or not  body's constant bombardment of muons and neutrinos plays a role in biochemical processes or responses. i haven't seen anyone directly imply that brain chemistry may be effected by this. sometimes I think this sort of stuff isn't far off from pseudoscience... but there are at least a few articles on google scholar that discuss similar possibilities and probabilities."

Tryptamines are sooo interesting! If you're interested in brain chemistry and psychoactives I'd really encourage you to research NMDA receptors, NMDA agonists,(think KET & DXM) 5-HT receptors, 5-HTP, and how Glutamate and GABA effect all of these things. I honestly believe there is another tryptamine at play in our brain besides serotonin that nobody's really found yet.

schizoaffective,fbda9r1,t3_ecncdb,1576754733.0,"after my initial schizophrenia diagnosis at 19yo, I smoked a lot of weed, took mushrooms a couple of times, acid once, MDMA or sassafras once or twice. LSD felt weird in a bad way. Salvia literally took me underground to the mental hospital I was in and it was like an mc escher drawing. Doctors were dragging me down impossible hallways while I was clawing the walls. it was hell.. but lasted like 15 minutes. I slowed down on the weed and started feeling paranoid when I did smoke, so I quit at about 22yo. 

I'm now 30, I read recently about ketamine potentially helping depression and also read about one doctor who is testing DXM as a potential antidepressant and antipsychotic. I went and got some DXM without any of the other garbage. DXM also happens to be my drug of choice... oops. I took it a couple of times at low doses.. felt better for a few days. took a pretty high recreational dose and had full blown psychosis, and had to go to the hospital. I was scared it wouldn't go away but it did after about a week. I felt like an idiot and my delusions were really embarrassing to be having around the nurses. 

Never again ha.

I will say that mushrooms were great for my spirituality, and changed my entire understanding of the world around me, but I don't think I'll ever take them again knowing that drugs/psychs are a trigger of mine."
