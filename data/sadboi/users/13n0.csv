It’s a great app. It uses a great system to drill words into you fast. I also put stick on notes on items in my house to learn what they are in target language. 

Once I’ve done that, I switch to Duolingo which teach you grammar and sentence construction. Write down what you learn. 

I also Google what the most used verbs are in the language and learn them. 

Learn common phrases, like “what’s up”, “where can I find an ATM. 

Read comic books, kiddie books, watch movies and then read a book you know very well like Harry Potter. 

Get a friend to practice with:)

With Arabic I first started with Duolingo because it was easier to learn the scripts and the sounds they make."

I landed in hospital against my will and got diagnosed with BP and GAd. I fought my doctor and diagnosis for a long time and it was hard to accept. I did not even believed that I was sick and should be in hospital. At the same I believed that the air freshener in my room where surveillance cameras to spy on my progress. 

Tip to you... in the end they can only treat your symptoms with meds no matter what you have. But if they suspect bipolar, they will add a stabilizer drug with it. BP people can’t take anti depressants without stabilizers because BPs can get manic (aka dangerous). This is why it’s important to go see a pdoc. 

Good luck to you. Let us know how it went:)"
