GachaLifeCringe,fqof6my,t1_fqnyl59,1589513866.0,"Hey!!! I‚Äôve been in that place before, and want you to know that more self-harm is nothing to aspire to. You get trapped in a cycle where it‚Äôs never enough and it makes everything worse and just leaves you feeling like shit, no validation or solutions or anything. Idk, you might be tired of hearing that self-harm is a short-term solution for a long-term problem, but it‚Äôs true. Please seek help (!!professional help!! if you‚Äôre in a situation where you‚Äôre able to do so safely!)"
