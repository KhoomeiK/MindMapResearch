Dogfree,fo2kfyg,t1_fo18or5,1587465794.0,I’m really glad I could change your mind!! I wasn’t aware that Pitbulls were so much more dangerous then other dogs either before I saw articles and personal stories here and started reading up on it cuz they’re advertised as misunderstood and that’s very easy to buy into when all the pits you’ve met have been friendly and it gets difficult to imagine that they are a very dangerous breed due to the gameness and ”kill switch” as well as how they’re built.
Dogfree,fo189vq,t1_fo17h92,1587427781.0,"[Here](https://www.askadamskutner.com/dog-bites/bite-statistics-according-to-dog-breed/), [here](https://www.google.se/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2018/09/13/americas-most-dangerous-dog-breeds-infographic/amp/), [here](http://bernews.com/2013/12/statistics-dog-attacks-interactions-by-breed/) and [here](https://www.charlesboyk-law.com/blog/injured-by-molosser-dog-bite/) are your statistics. Of course Pitbull type dogs can be sweet just as any dog (even chihuahuas...) can be considered sweet and be admired by people but you can’t deny that pits are unsuitable as pets, especially as family pets, and people who insist that they are the exception when it comes to breed traits are, at best, just ignorant/not very educated. The ”Its the owner not the breed” is repeated like its a religious mantra but Border collies were specifically bred to herd animals, Retrievers fetch, Bloodhounds track scents and Pitbulls were bred for bloodsport and fighting and, as you can tell by the statistics, it shows.

One of the reasons pitbull type dogs are especially dangerous is because they were bred for “Gameness”, wikipedia has a great description for it: ”In dog fighting breeds gameness is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack in baiting, despite ripped flesh, dehydration, exhaustion or broken bones. ""Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs."" They were also bred to not display warning signals before attacking since that would give them an advantage in fights and that’s why they are frequently known to attack “without warning.”.

I am not saying they are evil, its not their fault that they were bred to have these traits but they are an uneccesary risk to society since there’s hundreds of other breeds and I hope that you understand that no one is arguing with you for no reason."

Good invention however a huge chunk of the “pro trainers” seem to have gone to some alternative dog fanatic school were actual medical professionals (y’know those that actually have to try to fix the aftermath of dogs “bonding” with babies) and the other portion of pro’s opinions are completely unheard of like I wish it was more common knowledge that dogs, much less pitbulls, shouldn’t be left unsupervised with children but since “nanny dogs” are a thing I’ve lost hope.

a lot of owners redeem their dogs shitty behaviors, such as frequently attacking other dogs and humans, because it has an anxiety disorder/OCD/PTSD and I can imagine that a lot of people will label their dogs behavioral issues as mental illness so when they fail to train it they can go ”Well my dog has PTSD so its impossible to train out /insert shitty behavior/ so everyone else are just gonna have to accommodate us”. I also believe it can be used against owners that feel like they can’t take care of it but are made out to be the bad guy for even thinking about rehoming it cuz “You wouldn’t get rid of a child/friend/family member just because of their mental illness” and that shelters may use it to feed the hero complex and shame them for “giving up” on it.

Ok on a more serious note I think not neutering pets is cruel if you aren’t gonna use them for breeding and some peoples mindset about it is so weird and reaks of projecting their own issues and sexists views on the dogs saying shit like “Its cruel to not let them fuck” and “My dog has to experience what its like to be a mother!!” but if they’re not used for breeding you’re gonna have a  male dog that’s constantly horny which makes it unsafe to have around children and other pets cuz they’ll try to fuck anything. Females will also bleed everywhere and all their “motherhood” will result in eventually getting their puppies sold as soon as possible. I also saw an episode of Its Me or the Dog about a guy that refused to neuter his husky that then proceeded to try to violently hump his girlfriend and she could barley defend herself + it was aggressive af, the dog trainer demanded that he neutered it for the gf’s safety and said something along the line of “Isn’t it crueler to let it mate once and then never again?”.

And idk what animals will die if they don’t breed (expect for a few guys that insist they will I guess?). Also my cat was much happier after she got neutered cuz then she wouldn’t have to scream about not getting laid once a month :/ I have also been attacked by horny dogs and its humiliating and disgusting + I was a child and left me traumatized since the owner just watched while it tried to violate me."

therapy,fl4yqb7,t1_fl4vonz,1584824567.0,"Thats an old argument, those who diagnose it at a ”ridicolus rate” do so because they are specialists, or atleast have the proper education and experience with Dissociative disorders and/or trauma, and any decent psychologist would refer their patient to get assessed by someone that is actually qualified to do so.

I don’t know where you learned this and why you feel confident enough to make an assumption that my personal psychologist would diagnose my  friend, and two strangers I barley know, because she wouldn’t. Diagnosing someone with DID takes time and there is a lot of things to rule out, such as other conditions, if its influenced by outside sources or caused by drugs. It took me around a year to get properly assessed by a psychiatrist and two psychologists specialized in psychotherapy and trauma, it isn’t handed out like candy."

Few people that have DID seek treatment knowing about it (less then 10% if I remember correctly) but its worth pointing out that self diagnosis can be necessary to get the right treatment since most theraphists don’t seem to know enough to recongnize the symptoms and specialists can be difficult to find."

Dogfree,fl15zv7,t3_flx5sj,1584722666.0,"Omg what a disaster and sadly enough I see posts like this so many times that I decided to write about why Pits aren’t suitable as pets.

Reason 1: Genetics, a lot of people say “It’s the owner not the breed” like it’s a biblical law. Border collies were specifically bred to herd animals, Retrievers fetch, Bloodhounds track scents and Pitbulls were bred for bloodsport and fighting. 

Reason 2: “Gameness”, In dog fighting breeds gameness is valued as it gives the dog the ability to maintain the attack despite ripped flesh, dehydration, exhaustion or broken bones. ""Game is the dog that won't quit fighting, the dog that'll die in the ring, the dog that'll fight with two broken legs."" They were also bred to not display warning signals before attacking since that would give them an advantage in fights and that’s why they are frequently known to attack “without warning.”

Reason 3: Despite only 6% of all registered dog breeds as pets are pits they account for 73% of fatalities. Statistics don’t lie (although a lot of people claim that “media is biased” and that you can’t recognize the trademark blockhead of a pit) any reliable source will tell you that they account for the most attacks and fatalities. 

Not saying that Pits can’t be sweet, loyal or affectionate it’s just that there’s enough stories about how sweet pits suddenly turn and attack and due to their size, strength and gameness they will cause much more damage than other breed."

You can try wheeling her into the ”Collies herd” argument and show her youtube videos of puppies doing breed specific things and if she still insists that her ”Staffie” dosen’t pose a risk there’s plenty of more horror material on r/banpitbulls + I think someone recently posted a link to a video on pitbull puppies ”playfighting”. They’re not outright mauling each other but you can clearly see that the way the play is violent and different from other puppies.

Also, Pits were orginially bred to kill and distract bulls (Pit-against-Bulls) so they had to be able to lock down on an animal twice their size and not let go, then they bred them with Terriers to get the ”Lock down and shake” bite and when people started using them for fighting they bred them to not show signs of aggression/generally have a more confusing body language (also seen a video demostrating this on BanPitBulls) so others wouldn’t be able to predict when its gonna attack.

I really do hope your friend will listen to you cuz otherwise she’ll be risking her childs life by refusing to aknowledge that she has an animal that was bred to have a high pain tolerance, jaws that lock down and won’t let go and can attack out of nowhere + they don’t discriminate, I’ve seen posts and news articles of them going after infants, cops, elderly, disabled, horses, owners, complete strangers, other dogs, livestock etc."

The breeders in Puppy Mills want to maximize profit by producing the highest number of puppies at the lowest possible cost, the dogs are kept in small, stacked, wire-floored crates or in outdoor pens covered in filth and develop health issues like parasites, parvo and pneumonia. These dogs eat, sleep and give birth in confinement and the female dogs are bred at every opportunity, even if they are sick, injured, exhausted or have genetic traits that could be damaging to their puppies and are killed when they can’t breed anymore.

I guess its useful for nutters since these puppies get shipped to pet stores and are sold cheap, I think its a pretty big contributer as to why we got a shitton of neurotic dogs and the ”Rescue” trend were aggressive dogs fill up shelters looking for their ”furever home” that can’t be shared with other animals, children, disabled or old people."
