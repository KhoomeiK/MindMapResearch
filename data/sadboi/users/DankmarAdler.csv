1. Lock everything down 
2. Extend the lockdown a month
3. Extend the lockdown another month?"

It’ll be funny to see how this backfires in her face when public opinion turns on her because people are tired of being fed doomer rhetoric."
Anxiety,fo7yjw8,t1_fo7wev6,1587586757.0,Can one opt out of being tracked and traced by the government for having an infection they had no say in contracting? How does that work exactly? I know “we’re already being tracked anyways” but I’m curious to know how invasive these measures are because I’m not too keen on the government tracking people and potentially punishing them for it.

Most don’t have the luxury to take a post-lockdown sabbatical because they are scared."

He states many times over in this interview that the reason for such drastic measures at first was because of astronomically wrong predictions based on limited data."
