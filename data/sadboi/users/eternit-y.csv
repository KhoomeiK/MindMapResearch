I go to therapy for this. And I think you should too. If you have body dysmorphic disorder, no amount of plastic surgery will ever make you love yourself. You could look like *[insert favorite model or celebrity here]* and you would still dislike yourself and find something to fix.

I know this may be a big leap for you (as it is with many), but I would delete social media. My mentality improved a whole lot when I did. We're addicted to social media...and we don't even know it. Half the images on the platform are fake or edited. r/instagramreality

I edited your photo (obviously, a photo cannot accurately replicate the results of a rhinoplasty, so the editing is only used for reference) and I didn't think it improved your appearance.

- I wouldn't mess with the bridge of your nose, as you already have that ""scooped"" profile that people pay thousands for. 
- I wouldn't mess with the tip of your nose, as it is already turned at a desireable angle. Any more upturned and it does not look as desireable, particularly due to probable nostril exposure.
- You dislike the width of your nose, but I actually think the width provides balance to your face, creating a comfortable transition from eye to nose to eye. Any smaller and it looks too small and the eyes look too far apart. With how it is now, it looks balanced.
- The asymmetry of your nose is a valid concern, but I did not notice the asymmetry until you pointed it out. Considering everything else above, I don't think a rhinoplasty is necessary for you."

I'm gonna be real with you: *you should not get any cosmetic surgeries.* You have great features and are quite the beautiful lady. I'm no professional, but it sounds like you have body dysmorphia, a disorder marked by an intense obsession with real and/or imagined flaws, many of those flaws greatly exaggerated. You say you spend hours in the mirror each day, which is already one of the telltale signs, and the way you speak about your looks is degrading and obsessive. Please do not get any surgeries; get therapy instead. It makes me (and many others) very sad to see someone like you feel as if they are any less than beautiful."
