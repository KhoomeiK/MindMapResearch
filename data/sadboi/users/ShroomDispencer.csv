backrooms,fpjcqxc,t3_gdpu44,1588663811.0,"**Level -3.5** is an abandoned city, devoid of any plant (at least in the surface) or animal life. The ground is completely covered with metal scraps, ripped from the buildings by titans.

 > Titans are bloodthirsty creatures that wander through the city. Their only known objective is to prey on humans and will attempt to do so by any means possible. The titans rip senselessly at the walls searching for humans to fulfil their appetites. They are likely to eat animals as well and such is conjectured to be the cause for their extinction from the Level.

The city has a day and night cycle, though the sky is nearly always obscured by a toxic fog, fog which — if a human were to venture too high — could kill almost instantaneously. That has made this level very unsatisfactory for wanderers looking to settle down or even explore.

The soil is extremely fertile, however even the minimal amount of fog that is on the surface is enough to kill any and all fauna that tries to grow.

Needless to say that there are no colonies here, though there are a few heavily protected outposts underground and near the exits. They mainly use the underground soil as fertiliser and bring it to separate bases. A few groups do this, such as:
 - The Major Explorer Group
 - The Wild Wanderers
 - The Blackout

------

The picture was just so oddly inspiring so I had to do something with it. I really hope -3.5 isn’t already a level.
