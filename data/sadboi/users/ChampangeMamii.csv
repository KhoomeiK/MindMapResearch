Assistance,fkdhbr7,t3_fhir5z,1584078787.0,"Hello I‚Äôm a mom to a 6 year old and a 2 month old baby. This week was spring break and we got the news today that the school will be closed next week as well. The past few months have been hard since having the baby. Me and my husband both had strep throat this past week so he‚Äôs missed some work.

I tried to add a variety of items. Anything would really help us tremendously
