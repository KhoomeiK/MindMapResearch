Mankind’s feuds with Top 2 Rock and Austin are both higher profile stories than their respective feuds with the Undertaker. His title wins were HUGE moments that are still replayed. Plus, Foley’s book and other work outside the ring propelled him to way larger mainstream fame than Undertaker. 

So, yeah - I’d say Mankind, surprisingly."
