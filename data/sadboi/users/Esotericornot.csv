offmychest,fmqluxw,t1_fmpibje,1586302172.0,"I'm not sexually active at this time and I don't plan or wish to be. I was considering joining communities centered around this sort of thing at first, but I was turned off from it rather quickly. It's somewhat complicated for me to explain.  


I do want to state that while I by no means think cutting is okay nor do I believe it's a small deal, I don't cut for pleasure often and I don't go deep. Usually, I cut on my thighs where there's just enough bulk to avoid going too deep, and I wait until the scars are mostly healed to do it again."
mentalhealth,fmqlgf6,t1_fmqj6i1,1586301947.0,"There's physical, and then there's imaginary. I try not to cut too much, and I most certainly don't go dangerously deep (-usually I go for my thighs where it's a little safer, not that I think this isn't an issue). I don't often put myself through physical pain beyond that, most of it is kept to my imagination where I'd imagine myself dying or severely injured and find pleasure in it. I'm careful to avoid being reckless when I do hurt myself, but perhaps it really is time to seek help. Thank you for your kind words."
offmychest,fmpd6an,t1_fmpcg5b,1586278735.0,"Don't worry, I'm not going to be offended if others see it as a minor deal. This is simply something I don't know how to face. I don't know if it's good or bad, if I should be open or keep quiet about it, so on. Maybe it's no big deal and I'm worried for nothing. I'm seeking guidance on the internet for that very reason.

It's reassuring to hear that it wasn't an issue for you. That gives me some hope."
mentalhealth,fkw6dag,t1_fkw12f1,1584584502.0,"This is relieving for me to hear. Currently I'm in a position similar to OP, just a couple of years behind and still mid-addiction, though it's not gaming for me, rather one specific area in study, which I do all day while also watching YouTube often for fun. That's great, sure, except I don't want to do anything else. I don't want to get a job. I don't want to get new hobbies. I don't want to make friends. I just really hope that what you're saying is right and it will get better. I just think I'm lacking a reason to want to do anything other than studying something I don't want to do anything with but study."
mentalhealth,fkw5p3t,t3_fl0977,1584584052.0,"Please accept my sympathy. I really do wish I could express how much my heart aches thinking about you and your situation right now through text. Just reading it broke my heart enough to send me right into tears, and even so I can't even imagine the pain you're going through despite how deeply hearing of it troubles me.  

No matter what happens, please just try to remain as strong as you can and see it through to the end. Crying is nothing to feel ashamed over, either, I'm not a crier but even I believe it's there to relieve the built up or sudden stress. On an ending note, care for yourself to the best of your abilities as well. We're all scared and panicked, and it's okay."
mentalhealth,fksdlpx,t1_fksbuvs,1584487704.0,"Usually, it involves putting the back of my fingers against my cheeks (from knuckle to fingertips), putting the palms of my hands against my cheeks, or putting a folded hand over my mouth. Just holding it, sometimes massaging my cheeks.

I do pop pimples, but that's an entirely different issue and pretty separate from my concerns here. That's more of a cutting alternative for me."

mentalhealth,fkq0yze,t3_fjz7mw,1584426081.0,"Huh, there are some people that I want to act childish around, because it's stress-relieving. Keeping up with all the responsibilities you catch as you grow to be older gets stressful, and there's something about just acting like you're a kid again that makes me feel relieved. I like just stopping and playing in a particularly welcoming patch of grass like a child when I otherwise wouldn't, making kid sounds and talking nonsense, and just allowing myself to act like I've got the mind of a five-year-old time and time again, but I don't think it's problematic nor do I think it's abnormal. Life's stressful, don't let one of those silly vents that you don't even realize are relieving you get plagued by the stress as well. I believe that it's nothing to worry over."

mentalhealth,fhro2nr,t1_fhq0dh4,1581832081.0,It's hard to find motivation in a world that seems like it works just to crush it. I'm right in the same boat.
mentalhealth,fhrnxl1,t3_f4hsk6,1581831945.0,"No expert here, but it sounds like it could be any other phobia, like how lots of people experience the same with blood or height or spiders or whatever else might freak them out for no particular reason. I don't think it's much of an issue or something to feel ashamed over; and it can probably be either worked around or worked through with things such as exposure therapy."
