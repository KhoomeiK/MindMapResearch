AskGirls,fr3pxhm,t3_gm8co0,1589863130.0,As a shy person I’m generally attracted to the loudest in the room.. the person who knows everyone & can carry small talk with anyone. That’s never been me no matter how badly I wanted it to be me.. I’ve never been great at small talk so I generally rely on those types of people to draw out my talkative side or carry the conversation if I’m not as interested..

LSD,fquc461,t1_fqubcc2,1589656090.0,r/unclebens is great they have a step by step on an easy way to grow. Super cool to look into. The fact that you can just grow these lil things for yourself is so cool to me! If you have any other questions feel free to message me. I’m not an expert but I have done a bunch of research.
LSD,fqubvp4,t1_fqubcc2,1589655958.0,"That’s fair! It does seem a little sketch but visit r/shrooms they have tons of advice. They sell them for microscopic use only but that’s kinda the only way to get them. Also shroomery.com has tons of info on their site. They can ship anywhere except CA, GA or ID because spore research isn’t legal in those states unless you live in one of these states it’s completely legal to purchase spores. There’s one more page I want to recommend for advice on growing but let me check the spelling real quick."
LSD,fquah1m,t3_gkut7t,1589655177.0,Have you tried shrooms? They are not difficult to grown yourself & could have similar/same effects. I’ve heard a lot of good things with shrooms & depression. May be worth a shot.

I don’t know as a woman primarily interested in men I always ask about tattoos & if they are on the arms, touch them as I ask about each tattoo. Humans are incredibly responsive to touch so a light touch on the arm is generally not too invasive especially if the person is in to you. Flirting with women I haven’t figured out tho.."

So one day I pull up & see a guy cutting meat through the window & im like “damn who’s arms are those?” The shade were pulled down far enough I couldn’t see his face.

AskReddit,fqopjxn,t1_fqna339,1589521164.0,Yesss! I’ve gone to the bar one time when I had just had an bad/stressful day & it’s the only time alcohol has changed my mood. But 99.9% of the time it just amplifies what I’m already feeling.

askseddit,fqck0oj,t3_gi0umx,1589260243.0,"Everyone who is saying no- why? What is the worst that happens?

Don’t say that! Don’t tell ME you’re available! Haha! That’s about a hundred different ways I could take that!” I politely smiled & continued ringing him up. He goes “oh! She didn’t like that one..
