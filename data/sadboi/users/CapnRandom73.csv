>This album smokes two packs a day. Buy it a whiskey and a beer, and it'll tell you how once, in its youth, it was dragged through the desert, by its ankle, with a rope, behind an amx. How could it not? Between encouragement by the members of My Morning Jacket, and what I can only assume is Ray's growing love of psychadelics, Ouroboros will kick dirt in your face and insult your lover with its dying breath.

Mornings - ick.

Thrifty - My local thrift shop's employees know me by name. Also, in my line of work, they either get your soul or your wallet. You can't keep both (or sometimes either).
