there are tons of stories there ranging from fanfics to original fictions. You have star wars / mass effect / warcraft / litrpg (where the main character gets a ""level up system"") / DC universe / Marvel universe and many more.

 I never do understand why people keeps associating fanfics with porn or hormonal teens. Just filter them by word count. Those that exceed 150K words tend to be pretty good.

Single player games.... well, I'm a big bethesda fan but the best one with good story, characters and quest I'll say is Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and it's sequel.

Graphics is pretty dated but the banter and the different ways you can go about finishing quests are awesome.

it is absolutely horrible and there are sites that allow you to roughly get a sense of what the person is like as it searches through the user's history.

Obviously, people with newly created accounts are red flags. I always believed that if you have nothing to hide then talk to others using your main account. Is looking for new friends shameful? Why do you feel the need to hide behind another name?

I never dated before, never done anything, tried my best to not be an ""incel"" / ""redpill"" / ""pickup artist"".

I read a bunch of stuff that basically says ""do not circle your life around someone else, build up yourself up instead""

So I gym, tries to pick up new hobbies and honestly, I always thought that one day I will just ""naturally meet someone""

I text a bunch of people from dating apps but it's always ""very casual"". I find it hard to flirt because it feels scammy to do so. I don't even know if I'm into the person. What if I give the wrong signals? Isn't that basically leading her on?

But then, how am I suppose to know if I'm into her if I never try? Recently, I've asked around and got some advice to start calling instead of just texting and then moving towards face-time and hopefully meetups in the future. I've texted someone... I guess for nearly a year now from okcupid. We don't have deep conversations, just minor small talks. I can't honestly say that I want to date her. She's just someone to talk to in the afternoon when you got nothing to do. Pretty sure that works both ways too, it ain't like I'm ignoring her messages.

Heh, come to think of it, I am always the one to initiate a new topic, then we will message for a bit before it dies down again.

I'm just unsure about making the first step and then again, don't people always say, ""if you have doubts then you aren't ready / she is not the one""?

I think I'm terrified of being the ""bad guy"" more than someone rejecting me. 

What should I do? I keep wanting to do the right thing but I don't know what it is and I end up doing nothing.

then now, apparently people are “shocked” from govt response, saying that it’s too harsh, we should allow one to one meetups

fuck la

last time say millennium exploit the less than 10 gathering loophole by meeting up  more often in smaller groups.

now say too strict, should allow max 2 person meetup.

knn. govt can never win liao issit. Do anything also wrong. why not you be govt la. Run your party and say “I’ll allow people to gather in groups of two if you vote for me.”

it’s one thing to say “I’m really worried about how this will affect my bgr” and another to say “govt is going overboard.” 

ugghhhh"

Ugh, I feel like such a fking kid. Apparently, first and second base is pretty common ( supposedly ) in the first two dates and then sleeping together on the third/fourth date.

I can’t even comprehend it.

it’s not if I’m attractive or not. It’s just that I find it too fast.
