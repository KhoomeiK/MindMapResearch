mentalhealth,fqbf68c,t3_ghrmqw,1589235848.0,Iâ€™m terrified of no one making any changes. I am a graphic designer and I can work from home completely - yet most jobs still require you to come in 40 hours a week. Iâ€™m not saying I have to stay home all week but dang the fact that so many companies are inflexible makes me dread the future. Why canâ€™t we have the chance to take care of ourselves better?

Another thing I figured out after this post was that they are very selfish, there are not many things I can thing of that are done just because or for me. Itâ€™s to keep me or gain something. Or itâ€™s just totally obvious. And always the bare minimum. It pisses me off when they call it care because itâ€™s not."

I think irony and tragedy do make for interesting stories because if they are done well it really hits you hard. I think some people get so uncomfortable by the ending that they dismiss the book and don't like it. (which isn't bad or anything, just interesting to see different reactions).

I think she nailed it too. I also think she did an amazing job writing the increase of urgency throughout time. And then the way it all came out at once on the ride to the train at the end, and it made them crazy and reckless. 

I also don't think I like to put blame on any of the characters. They all had their issues making them unhappy and they all made choices that led to what happened. It breaks my heart that it ended that way but..it was still a very interesting book and has stuck with me for some time."

And I'm a skeptical person too. It's always good to be as long as we don't let it push the good away. It IS foreign and scary. 
Also, when we look at ourselves we are way more critical. I usually tell him if I outwardly spoke about myself the way he speaks about himself he'd yell at me hahaha. (although I have my moments).

Not that she should've been outright rude about you but like..maybe she wanted the point to get across...because it obviously didn't work the first time.

I make dirty jokes with my guy friends without being sexually attracted to them. Some people are just open about that stuff. She probably didn't feel like it was a threat/insensitive since she already rejected you and thought you got the message.

Just get over her, seriously. Go to work, keep your distance. Stop trying to justify every single thing you did as if it was totally okay. You both behaved immaturely and unprofessionally. Focus on your work - go out and meet new friends."

I'm thinking of maybe asking if she believes in loved ones coming to your dreams and if she's totally like ""nah"" just tell her really fast and leave it but if she does maybe tell her a bit more detailed and let her handle it how she wants (with my support if she needs of course)"

If you can- be kind and let her know you definitely think she's cool and you like talking to her. But only give it one (or two at the most) more tries, especially if she's nervous. I get that way too. But also, it could be way worse than just ""shy"" and in that case..there's only so much you can do haha.

It did feel like in the dream he wanted me to help even though I'm afraid it's not my place. I've known him and her for a long time, so I could understand why he'd come to me. He was a great man, truly! And I do want to help him but now I feel stupid from what that person told me haha.

relationships,eumehut,t3_cgw45v,1563914687.0,"My friend went through the exact same thing - I believe it was the same diagnosis as well. She was hurt a lot! He would ignore her for days at a time at one point and it really got her down. But she never did give up - she felt the same way you did about your boyfriend. I'm not sure what caused his mood alterations - brain inflammation or the medications but yeah.. there are times he snapped out of it and they still had good times together. When things wore off or got a little better he would be slightly back to his normal self. Also, she thinks he kept ending things because he wasn't sure if he wanted to put her through the pain.

If you want to see this through whatever happens it will be tough emotionally but I suggest giving space sometimes. His mental health is probably suffering as well. If he can talk to a doctor to help him deal with all the emotions (like CBT, not more medication) I'm sure that would help as well. She used to keep in touch with the family as well to know how he was doing while giving him the space he needed. 

It really is hard because I'm sure he's not doing these things on purpose. I think him knowing you won't give up on him and that you genuinely want to go through this with him might give him some assurance. And you know if he does something harsh to you and you need a day or a few days to stay away - you can do that too (hopefully someone else is helping you?). Taking care of yourself while also being there for him. 

Also doing some of his favorite things did help him when he was terribly depressed (but at those times he was more stable with his emotions - just FYI if it's an outing) Help reminding him of the things that are important to him, maybe writing little notes for him to find when you're not around. Like thoughtful things. Depending on how you two have interacted. Anything personal and thoughtful. 

And again - don't forget to take time to care for your own emotions during this time. Sending you lots of love and hope I could help at all!"
