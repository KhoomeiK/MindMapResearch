PuertoRico,fcbrlik,t1_fcbg2qi,1577590191.0,I don’t know.  People’s behavior in the barrio near me as well as the animals have been really intense.  Unsettling.

BreakUps,fcahzec,t3_egnr90,1577569567.0,"Good lord it does.  7 months here and I think about her everyday.  Why I wasn’t good enough.  Why I was replaced.  I hate it so much.  I can’t kick the thoughts either.  It’s such a depressing feeling.

Suicidal too :("
PuertoRico,fc6omtj,t1_fc5cc43,1577485590.0,No defiantly some kind of animal.  The neighbors were freaking out too.
PuertoRico,fc6olh5,t1_fc59wea,1577485562.0,Hell no !  My aunt has lived here for all her life and she was freaking out.  This is my first time here and whatever it was it was huge.  Like a wolf and moved fast.
PuertoRico,fc6of9w,t1_fc5aolu,1577485440.0,No pienso.  Oye algo como lobo or perro largo
PuertoRico,fc6odqx,t1_fc58x69,1577485410.0,I made one but it sucks.  All it shows is my aunt terrified and I’m not going to put that online.
PuertoRico,fc6o9ss,t1_fc5dh8l,1577485332.0,Around us.  The neighbors were terrified and so was my aunt.  It was huge and moved fast.  I heard it run right through all the shrubs and trees like it was grass.  I took a picture of the damage it made.
PuertoRico,fc6o3qr,t1_fc55pi4,1577485214.0,Whatever it was it moved REALLY fast

Defiantly not parranda.  The lady I live with was terrified."
PuertoRico,fc6bsch,t1_fc5dh8l,1577476893.0,"The neighbors were freaking out over something around the the barrio.  

I couldn’t understand them.   Everything is calm now.  The lady I lived with said it was an huge animal walking the streets"

BreakUps,fbymrme,t3_eeyn7p,1577220883.0,Fuck No!
BreakUps,fbbkyq8,t3_ebxchx,1576702611.0,"What would you recommend to do if I was the dumpee?  I failed to change for my ex and she dumped me.

She is incredibly happy now and with a healthier, happier person and all though I’m happy for her, I wanted to be apart of that.

I’m stuck letting go and not forgiving myself for my failure and losing weight, hobbies etc don’t take away the reality of what I lost.

I’m just horribly depressed and hopeless I’ll ever feel better. I’m even considering suicide. Its been 6 months and I actually really miss her even though I should just worry about myself.

I just wish I had the willpower like you to move on. Find better.  

I just hate myself so much."
BreakUps,fbbji5r,t3_eccd7a,1576701754.0,"Some strategic advice on how to let them go would be nice. It’s 7 months now and I’m still attached to her. 

She’s dating someone far better looking than me now.

I really fucking hate who I am."
BreakUps,fbbj4ey,t1_fbacwoi,1576701534.0,"It’s seriously one of the worst feelings. As if you never existed and they are so much happier and better off.

I went to the moon and back for her and after 3.5 years, she’s now with someone doing better, happier.  I was tossed aside like a fucking used rag.

Whatever you do, don’t settle.  Make sure who ever you find, you find them being the best version of yourself, the person she couldn’t get.

I know for me, it will be years.  

Lastly, the good news is that it doesn’t get any worse.  This is the last phase of finally moving on.  Basically the most painful, but once we get use to it,  it’s officially over."
BreakUps,fbbhq38,t1_fbb5q6z,1576700712.0,"Thanks my friend.  Shit cuts deep seeing that smile she has with another man.  


Figuring out how to let go has been incredibly difficult.

Just all around sad as fuck."
BreakUps,fbbgv7g,t1_fbbgmx3,1576700194.0,"Lmao...  it’s so hard not too.  

I feel like a failure and watching someone be what I’ve been working so hard to be is a really shot in the nuts.

I basically put on like 15 lbs getting out of the military from the stress and transition. I’m 5’8 220.

This guy is 6’5, shredded and looks like everything I failed to be."
