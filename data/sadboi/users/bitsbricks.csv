Yes, it’s hard to live with the burden that someone died and it’s remotely related to you, and I understand that cause I am a doctor, but that wasn’t your fault. You were doing your job. The people at the nursing home or the hospital were gonna die when their time comes anyway, with or without you or this pandemic. Alcohol isn’t gonna fix it or help you go through it. I wish I could tell you to reach out to a therapist, but due to your financial situation, how about you reach out to an online service. Working and powering through what you’re feeling is actually a good idea, but please also allow yourself to feel the pain and sorrow. Feeling them and crying hardly over them will help you get them out and off your chest. May god heal your soul."
