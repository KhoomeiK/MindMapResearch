What I would suggest is that fantasies are always neutral. We can't pick our fantasies; they're somewhat analogous to a sexual orientation, they just kind of happen to us. Your fantasies are there for your pleasure, not anybody else's. You deserve to enjoy them guilt free (unless the guilt is a part of the kink).

Note this does not mean you have to act out this fantasy. Fantasies are not reality. You can use them to inspire your sex life, but they are not a script that you are required to fill. It's possible to have fantasies that you never act on. It's possible to have fantasies that are impossible or impractical to fulfill.

> How could a man want to watch his wife be intimate with another man? How could he want to watch me be with another man?

It's actually a pretty common kink. I suspect lots of couples talk about it, at a minimum.

Here's where you should start: You don't have to participate in anything you don't want to. If you don't want to talk about this with him, you don't have to. If you don't want to entertain this fantasy, you don't have to. ON THE OTHER HAND, you should recognize that him sharing this fantasy required some vulnerability on his part, and the proper response to that is something like gratitude and kindness. 

What I would recommend is approaching him, and saying something like ""your idea of wife sharing surprised me, and I wasn't prepared for it. My initial reaction wasn't ideal, and I want a do over. Tell me again about this fantasy. I can't promise you that I will want to indulge it, but I do want to honor the trust you showed by sharing it with me.""
