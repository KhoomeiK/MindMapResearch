BorderlinePDisorder,fgoljpr,t1_fglgb9d,1580974758.0,"From what I gather your mom may have BPD along with some codependency issues. You can‚Äôt sacrifice your needs in an effort to appease and keep your mom happy, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve realized that you literally can‚Äôt make her unhappy when she‚Äôs dealing with a lot of inner turmoil. If you‚Äôre able to separate yourself and move out, this would be the first step in creating boundaries, but once you start creating them, the hardest part is sticking to them because if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll never pull yourself out of her control. I would say find a therapist, one that can help you through this process because doing it alone is damn near impossible otherwise it would‚Äôve been done already.

There‚Äôs hope, you‚Äôre just going to have to deal with a lot of uncomfortableness, but keep your eye on the prize, which is putting yourself and your wellbeing first. You can‚Äôt will your mom into getting better, but you can work on yourself."
