leagueoflegends,foydtzp,t3_g98qdm,1588170705.0,"""While if you play a mage, even with dorans rings + Lost chapter, you hard lose your trade vs any assassin with a dirk."" 

This just isn't true and assassins would be worthless if they couldn't win early tades, there'd be no point in picking them. They get outscaled by everything in the game, mages, tanks, bruisers, adcs, all of them.  If they didn't win early or win late you'd be wintrading to pick them. 


""The assassin will have a huge kill potential with just a 1100 gold item component, with 1 round of spells, while mages with 1300+400 gold item could barely pose any threat with 1 round of spells.""


What are you talking about man? Any decent mage right now like Zoe, Syndra and LeBlanc 100% have kill threat on you with this. 


""For instance, if you get hit by a Zed WQE, you‚Äôll be at 30% HP, and then you have to either back or wait to die, since post lvl 6 Zed can engage on you from 1000* unit away."" Same shit with Zoe or Syndra?
