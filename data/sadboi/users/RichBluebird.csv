confession,euga046,t1_eug1uh8,1563803555.0,"> You may not see it now, but any man who judges you on your past sexual history is not a man who respects you.

I understand OPs concerns and issues with her upbringing, but this is the simple truth here. Not all men are like that."
depression,eu0p8lw,t3_ce9wp5,1563352240.0,"Yeah, the real me is weak and pathetic, the fake personalities are smarter and more confident. When you show people the fake things they want to see, they will feel disappointed about the real thing."
mentalhealth,etwrtog,t3_cdw5xx,1563282287.0,I feel the same. I got better at dealing with life but it didn't change the fact that I still don't want it.
UpliftingNews,ettcwaa,t1_ett3gze,1563173679.0,"> You’re hurting yourself trying to be someone you are not. You try to create a life and a family based on a lie.

Well yeah, that's my decision. It's what society and my family wants. And if it's too much, no big loss, there's more healthy and sane people out there than me.

> They’d be consenting to die, but they are not thinking about what’s best for them

Living a life you don't want to live is never ""the best"", regardless of which ideology is forcing it upon you."
mentalhealth,etl2scx,t3_cc7a79,1562918701.0,"> they just see me as insane and disapprove 

I'd think it's insane to want to accurately assess someone in a 10 minutes talk while therapists need months to somewhat understand you."
SuicideWatch,etbqkzz,t1_etbovgu,1562657128.0,"Thanks. I'm not even sure what they're supposed to do honestly. I just dislike myself and nothing they do can change anything about it. I don't even want to get better. I just don't want to make my parents sad or disappoint them, but I know this can't go on forever. It's difficult to talk to psychiatrists because I often act cheerful and confident and claim everything is fine, so when I suddenly start talking about anxiety or depression people probably think I'm just messing with them. I have many fake personalities with fake feelings that are better than me in every aspect that showing the real me makes me feel deeply ashamed and I feel people won't even believe me."
mentalhealth,et9tdo7,t3_canfmi,1562604958.0,Probably not a good advice but I just gave up on trying to do things that I don't really need to do. I don't know if it's ADHD or depression though.
depression,et7mtb8,t3_cab776,1562534016.0,It sounds like she might have some serious problems herself honestly.
