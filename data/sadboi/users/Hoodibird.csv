Why shave the Semi? Because her back hair is course and sparce. It does not keep the dog warm so you'll need clothes. The hair will get very itchy under the clothes because it bends in all directions and the dog will be uncomfortable and constantly scratching herself. Buzz the hair and keep your Semi happy!

What helped me was putting up baby gates, closing doors and putting on calming music for them. Also chews are available at all times. On the furniture she chewed I sprayed bitter pet repellant from the pet store so she wouldn't chew on that again.

Don't leave the dogs alone for too long in the beginning and increase your away time slowly over the months. Practice staying alone every day (with and without the other dog) by going outside for short time to take the trash out or to go potty with one dog then the other. I always go with both at once but in the evening before bed I go with them separately and the other has to wait their turn in the apartment."

This is what you're supposed to do in the beginning, along with turning around and building distance if the dog starts to growl and bark.If she sees a dog and does not bark I give extra treats and praise. She used to growl at people too but now she is only wary of them entering her personal space. She even lets strangers give her treats and pet her sometimes. Progress is slow but steady!

Yesterday we faced another problem... I let a friend walk my puppy in front and she started barking and lunging at a calmly passing dog while I was behind with my other dog. In that moment I think it was just too close for her and she got nervous."

So far I know that with Cresties they may react badly to antibiotics, grains, too much protein in the food, wool, too warm clothes or too itchy clothes. They also suffer from dry skin so you shouldn't use too much product when giving them a shower or bath.

A friend of mine suggested to wipe down the dog every evening with just a wet towel if he has skin issues. And you can use baby lotion and baby shower gel on the dog, but stay away from cheap products.

Also make sure the hairless dog gets enough veggies or has a higher than average percentage of vegetables in his kibble. Too much protein can cause akne, that's why breeders recommend to start feeding adult food to puppies 4 months+, since puppy food has too much protein."
