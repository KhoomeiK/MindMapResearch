I just finished a container of the vital proteins collagen and my results were mostly positive but I do get what you're talking about.

The thing about collagen peptides is that they have a wide amino acid profile, and some of those amino acids, for instance like l-arganine, can act as vasodilators.  So you're taking a pre work out, that by itself could increase your anxiety, and the collagen could be increasing the physical feelings of anxiety.  I don't know about how it effects serotonin levels as someone else posted but I didn't really feel a big change in my mood other than more energy.  I'll try to look into it deeper though. 

One thing's for sure though, ill spare the details since I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to post them, but my girlfriend of 7 years loved what the vital proteins brand did for me and was regularly comparing me to a gorilla with a warm metal bat until I ran out.  So the vasodilation and physical energy boost is definitely real in my experience.  

Another Important thing to mention however is I would typically only use 1 scoop (half serving) with a wpi meal replacement powder and coffee in the morning and 1 after work with coffee or whatever else I was drinking, and I did that just to try to make it last longer since it's expensive.  However, after I figured out the physical benefits, If I knew I was about to go to bed with my chick I would use 2 scoops an hour prior and the physical effects would be notably higher.  If we weren't getting it on though, I could totally see it manifesting into anxiety if I didn't have somewhere to put that extra energy.

After running out I tried switching over to Bulletproof brand hydrolyzed collagen this past week as it was less expensive per oz and the only other one available at the store, and I'm realizing the amino profile is not exactly the same. I'm definitely not getting the same effect, definitely haven't been in ""pet gorilla mode"" like before.  I actually might be experiencing higher anxiety with that brand, but i also have been taking the full 2 scoop serving every time I've used it.  Joints feel fantastic though.  So I still gotta experiment a bit to figure it out.  Feel free to dm or respond to me in the future if you would like to know how that's going.  


TLDR; and in conclusion; as someone that uses collagen peptides as well as a person that needs to manage anxiety, my suggestions are either to cut your dose in half, to try another brand, or to cut out or lower your pre workout/creatine/caffeine intake.  Unless you just want to stop taking one of them altogether.  Im benefiting from using it for sure, but if you are using it in combination with the wrong things, i could totally see it giving you a dysphoric effect like heightened anxiety.

Hope that helps at least a little!  Try to not fret, we are in an odd part of world history right now but we will be out of it before we know it."

ArenaFPS,fcaer7i,t1_fc8umz6,1577567980.0,"So for qw's movement style and weapon set you can get away with tighter turns, and more open areas since there's no rail.  I've never played q1ctf but if there's one thing to consider it's the fact that the grapple gives a lot of leeway when it comes to map size as you can build up speed fairly fast, but it's also good to have some verticality because of the grapple as well.  

So the big things to keep in mind are the movement and the lack of a rail gun.

 Also default pentagram of protection ie invincibility is bullshit and does not belong in a competitive arena map.  Keep the quad in a choke point and the ring of shadows more out of reach.  

Mega and heavy armor should be in a hard to reach chokepoints in a duel map and perhaps less hard to reach chokepoints in standard dm.  For ctf I typically keep a mega in an out of reach area in each base and keep heavy armor in a central chokepoint.  

That's all I got for now as a noobish unreal mapper."

Nootropics,ewnnes1,t3_cp4u4g,1565583560.0,"Yeah this happened to me last year.  

Basically I was under a lot of stress dealing with both my cat dying, my girlfriend developing seizures, and my coworker friend that I got hired suddenly decided she was going to start showing up an hour late every day dressed up like an 80s goth hooker wearing liquid paper white makeup and big hair. so like the idiot I am, I decided to combat it all with alcohol and red bull on top of drinking undiluted cold brew coffee.  the stress I was under was so much it threw my hormones out of wack, so badly in fact when my Cortisol would spike from the stress levels I started developing hyperglycemic symptoms.  I went from being able to tolerate it all to suddenly having blood pressure readings of 180/110 just walking around my job.  So after seeing a doc and finding out about the blood pressure issues I was giving myself from the vodka intake I cut it out along with the red bull and coffee.  Unfortunately that's all the docs could tell me, and I had to research everything else.  

Why am I telling you this? Because one of the side effects of the whole cortisol misbalance was not being able to deal with coffee in the slightest.  I became so caffeine sensitive a cup of green tea felt like 2 shots of espresso and coffee brought on full blown anxiety attacks.  

After doing a bit of research back the I came to find that there's something about coffee that helps it bypasses the lining of an internal organ or two that makes it hit a lot harder than other forms of caffeine.  

So I stuck with the green tea for a while and ate low carb to keep my blood sugar even.  It took a few months but I'm back to drinking coffee again.  No more red bull lol.  

The anecdotal advice I can give you is just lay off the caffeine in general and just figure out an effective way to chill out until these symptoms fade out.  Find a shrink if you need to.  You may be struggling with something subconsciously that you would need a professional to diagnose"
