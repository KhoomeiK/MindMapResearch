Anxiety,f61soss,t3_dq5hh6,1572646070.0," In reality, you are not losing control, you are just thinking too fast. This will eventually pass as you slow down your thoughts. It's like a movie that goes by so fast that you catch only a few scenes, and thanks to low self-esteem, you formulate something that doesn't correspond with what is actually happening. You're not crazy, just exhausted. And you won't lose control because although you feel vulnerable to everything, you don't see it as a total reality, it just sounds like a painful thorn, but I guarantee that as soon as you slow down your thoughts, the relief is so great.

So stop blablabla about me knowing the difference. The point here is that I need to sleep, sleep as fuck, deeply and comfortably. And I know, morphine is perfect for that, but I just want to sleep and I don't want again opiates, but I love them hehehe"
