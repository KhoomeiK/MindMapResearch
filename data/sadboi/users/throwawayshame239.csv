Anger,foavkez,t1_fo6e25l,1587653136.0,"I appreciate it, I am trying really hard but am having a hard time believing that I deserve forgiveness.  I love my baby girl more than anything and I would give my life to be able to clean up some pee and poop mess from her again.  I took it for granted and I let my emotions make me do a horrible thing.  It breaks my heart into a million pieces.  I want to forgive myself but I can't stop thinking about how horrible it was.  I try and focus that this is a temporary life and I will be able see her again some day.  I just want to take it all back but I can't go back in time, I can't. :("
Anger,foav8og,t1_fo7pnnh,1587653018.0,"Thank you for responding to me, it's super nice to talk to people on here.  I appreciate that you care, and yes I try so hard.  I watched so many videos and read so many things about learning to forgive yourself and understanding that ""you deserve forgiveness"".  I have a hard time believing I deserve forgiveness, it is very difficult.  Thank you again"
