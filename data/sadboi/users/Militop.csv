When you start posting your CV, don't be afraid of rejection. It's part of the game. You'll receive many unnecessary feedback, just ignore them. You should keep your motivation high, plus it happens to all of us.

learnprogramming,fn2tal2,t1_fn2rvu6,1586602443.0,"Okay, I see. When you don't have specific experience in a field, a company would look at something else.
The issue is, you have to show them something so they know you can do the job. You're competing with others, therefore any comparison with others will be rough.

I think focusing on one solid project that you finish should help you. Take 3 months for instance to do something, then consider working for any companies, IT related. You're building a career. 

Any years spent in a company will matter, then the need to obtain a degree will fade. In the world of work, experience always prevail for obvious reasons.

Example: You have two employees that work in the same field (in a bank for instance)
One is bringing millions over three years, but has no degree, the other brings some thousands, but has plenty of degrees
