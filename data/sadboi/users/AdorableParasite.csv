morbidquestions,fqa9a0s,t1_fqa7zb8,1589215091.0,"Who defined things like a job or a career as important? Other people. And you know what? They don't know anything more about life than you do, they just act like they do. 

Life isn't about checking off a list. There is no overlying set of rules, and being alive does not come with any strings attached.

You exist. The rest is up to you. And no one else, absolutely no one, no matter what society tells you, can expect or demand anything from you. It's - your- life. And success doesn't equal living.

I am very sorry you are feeling the way you do. Believe me, you are not alone in this. But it's not because you are failing to meet society's expectations, it's because society itself is failing you and others like you. It's flawed, opinionated and built on made up values that should never give you the impression you or your life are worthless.

Fell asleep behind the wheel once, in the middle of the night on a highway, and was woken by the horn of the truck driver behind me. I remember jerking the wheel around and generally missing any sense of orientation for a second, which could have ended very badly. Fortunately at that point I was down to 40km/h and alone on the road, apart from him, so all went well.

Abortion is a very difficult topic, especially when you are made to feel like it is wrong, directly or by implication.

Your motives are valid and understandable, and I hope you acknowledge and feel proud of the courage it took for you to make this decision.

(lightly) pinching to strain and stabilize the skin is the only thing that works for me.

And if the itch is directly on the nipple it's even worse.

In my experience breasts and balls dont behave that differently, although with balls you got more loose skin to work with, so I imagine that makes it a little easier for guys to scratch that itch. Then again I don't envy you for the task of shaving all that loose skin, so I guess it evens out."

My recommendation would be to talk to your partner and get his perspective , as that might put your mind at ease, and dig a little deeper to find out what exactly is the thought process leading up to your reaction. Once you understand it, you can work on it. 

As many others already pointed out, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the situation, and most people would probably view as a rather vanilla act. That doesn't mean your feelings aren't valid, and you shouldn't do anything you don't feel comfortable doing, but rest assured, it's a perfectly normal thing to do.
