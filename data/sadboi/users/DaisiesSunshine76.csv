The wait times of specialists on universal healthcare, from what I understand, aren't much longer than ours. I completely understand why many don't want government to have control over healthcare. Quite frankly, our federal government is very inefficient and slow at times, so things would have to drastically improve for it to work. I just wish that the Republicans in office would have done something about healthcare by now. Sure, Obama's plan wasn't great and charging fees for people who can't afford healthcare is criminal, but it was at least an effort to fix the system.
