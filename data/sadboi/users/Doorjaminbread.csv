Sending you all the love and all the healing. I hope creating this at list have you a glimpse of peace. Reading what you wrote made me cry with/for you. 
Maybe that is why this sub is so powerful. To have so many people who will love and lift us up even as strangers."
bipolar,fh85vrm,t1_fh82l70,1581352714.0,"I am so sorry. It can be very frustrating. I was first diagnosed as a teen back in the 90s and I always tried to explain to my parents when I got in trouble (a lot) that I didn‚Äôt really remember the things that I did past a certain point. I hope March goes well for you. The one thing that I think helps when first being diagnosed is to be completely transparent about every single thing you feel, see or hear. What you take as normal every day behavior might be a symptom. The first time I told someOne how I always heard far away chatter and music, they looked at me like I had sprouted a third eye.... I assumed everyone did. Shrug."

bipolar,fh80fck,t3_f1hwri,1581349221.0,"Always. I was in a full manic swing this last week. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. Was making everyone crazy. Word vomited at like 10 people, then I had to play a show (I‚Äôm a musician) and it went swimmingly until I completely crashed after the set and several shots. Lucky for me my nearest and dearest are aware. But I was at a venue crashing and quite literAlly put down my cigarettes and was like...please just get me home. Hid in bed all day wondering who I offended and if anyone got any pics or video.... it‚Äôs the worst."
bipolar,fgnve5y,t3_ezez1b,1580953737.0,Mine is also music and sometimes I think I hear crying (I‚Äôm a mom but not of young children anymore)... sometimes it‚Äôs high pitched rings and tones. I also hear  noises in things that don‚Äôt make noises... like the fan or even the window sometimes. Honestly it is the main reason I hardly sleep.
bipolar,fgiqmb3,t3_eyqkbs,1580828695.0,The problem is this is the number one thing that keeps me from falling asleep usually.
bipolar,fgiqjn9,t1_fgim8n4,1580828644.0,Yes I also could use tips.
IndianCountry,ffse94t,t3_eutrvr,1580179591.0,This just makes my stomach hurt so much. I can‚Äôt look at these children with out seeing the faces of my own children and it makes me tremble. Truth is so so so hard to see sometimes. Nothing that is done now will ever overcome that trauma.

But more Moderation of everything."
ketorecipes,fehywgb,t1_fehyr7a,1579126665.0,My sister said really good stuff about that bread. I haven‚Äôt seen it here. It is chewy. But toasted in butter it‚Äôs not too bad truly.
ketorecipes,fehysg3,t1_fehyo9j,1579126599.0,Maybe I‚Äôll try that next week... the stores are literally an exit apart.
ketorecipes,fehy052,t1_fehxszz,1579126127.0,"I think that‚Äôs totally fair. I‚Äôll be the first to admit I am not the master of strict keto. I keep my carbs in check but as someone who has always been behind an oven, I guess I am just really willing this to not push me away from goals because I just love French toast."
ketorecipes,fehxes1,t1_fehws2z,1579125776.0,"Ok I think that is a super legit concern. I read the label and just willed it to be the real deal. Here‚Äôs my quick 1-2. I started keto on December 26th 2019. So right over 3 weeks. Down 18 pounds and haven‚Äôt gone over 23 g carbs. I‚Äôm gonna eat this bread every day for a week... toast, French toast, grilled cheese whatever. I‚Äôm gonna see what happens with my urine and my weight. If it goes well I‚Äôll
Post again in a week and then at least I‚Äôll have an idea if I can keep buying it. That being said, for reference I‚Äôm over 40, wanting to drop 35 pounds total and have made a shit ton of kids so I‚Äôm no spring chicken. Anyhow, I don‚Äôt mind being a trial and error person... I‚Äôm
In this for the thrillüôÑ"
ketorecipes,fehwvqr,t1_fehwj3n,1579125472.0,Ok I have the lakanto syrup that I really like. But I also do this think where I take a couple table spoons of butter and kind of make a reduction with liquid caramel the sugar free stuff that is used in coffees. And I heat it over a stove with a bit of vanilla bean... actually makes a pretty decent texture if you cook it on low heat slowly enough. Shrug. I guess it‚Äôs all about preferences.
ketorecipes,fehw4tp,t1_fehvr1w,1579125048.0,"Ok here is my take away. It‚Äôs a little spongy but not dry. Definitely dense and it tastes better grilled they just plain like a sandwich. Very filling. Doesn‚Äôt seem to have any aftertaste that is weird. As a person who grew up in kitchens and worked with food most of my adult life, I would give this a 9 out of 10 for something that is keto and still ‚Äúbread‚Äù. Actually the more I think about it, would probably make amazing croutons and well as fully toasted and then crushed as bread crumbs .... for 7.99 it is worth every penny and I will be buying it from now on. Hope that helps."
Instagramreality,fehv7x3,t3_ep6fux,1579124530.0,Oh this is just so uncomfortable to look at
ketorecipes,feht7s8,t1_feht2kq,1579123396.0,Ok so it was 7.99. In the cooler next to the bread section. But I had it as a grilled cheese last night just to try it out.... it legit tastes like bread.....like real bread.

NativeAmerican,fdqzqhy,t3_emnpo1,1578677531.0,"I don‚Äôt know if this will help at all. But I found some of my grams old jewelry. Some she made, some she was given. Anyhow. Something about seeing tangible heirlooms and even things I had idea where it came from made me feel connected. Maybe seeing tribal art? Photographs? Maybe that would give you some connection or a small path to lead you closer to where you came from who you are? Your ancestors stories or even images. I don‚Äôt know if that will help, but the internet can be such an amazing tool. I wish you so much love and so much peace. Also I will say one last thing that I have felt. once you have been removed by a couple generations and have been living in the American landscape that isn‚Äôt your tribal traditions, I feel so nervous to reach out to family even distant on the reservation and surrounding areas because I feel like they have carried a burden that I haven‚Äôt. And they have had traditions I don‚Äôt know or understand. I hope you don‚Äôt feel this way. Everyone one deserves to know where they came from and where they have blood."
NativeAmerican,fdqyu13,t1_fdqamop,1578676990.0,Oh wow... your story sounds so much like mine except my parents rejected it even more. Y‚Äôall should be pen pals!!!! There should be more pen pals! More connections. So many of us are just lost. Also OP‚Äôs word estranged penetrated my heart.
keto,fczg5r0,t3_ejp1db,1578100525.0,"If you live near an aldis they have a bag of spinach for 1.29, 2 pack butter for 1.69 or coconut oil for 3.69. They always have some type
Of protein on sale and under a dollar frozen veggies. Not super exciting but when you add some
Condiments and peanuts or sunflower seeds for
Some crunch, you can stretch it. You can do this at other stores too they just have killer prices here in our area. Also you can splurge on those proteins and get salmon when it‚Äôs on sale. Also as boring as it is I love to wrap spinach around cheese and add a bit of bacon  in it with some mayo and a thing of bacon costs about 3.50 there. The key I think is to make eating keto easy and available in the beginning especially on a budget. There are tons of options with few ingredients. Speak from experience. Good luck you have this! I also do not like eggs alone"
OldSchoolCool,fcza141,t3_ejnes3,1578096702.0,Looks like a Vidal Sassoon ad! Perfection! They just airbrushed the senior photos here for the kids and cannot compare to this!
keto,fcz0l94,t3_ejl4ob,1578091237.0,"As I stay at home mom of 7, 5 still home, as well as a home school mom, man do I get how hard it is to cook and bake each and every meal and live every waking moment with things you enjoy just out of reach! Sweets and candies etc. the one thing that has helped me so much is having those types of treats that are keto friendly. I make a pan of peanut butter Choc fat bombs and have them frozen on hand. I also definitely buy several keto friendly snacks, Amazon has an amazing selection of keto gummy bears and chips. 
My husband has no interest in keto and definitely is a carb fan because he is an avid distance biker, but I had to say our loud... I don‚Äôt want to change you but I need you to be aware of me. He was also snacking and such during our movie nights etc. and even though I feel like I have good will power the crunch and smell was almost over powering. Funny thing, once he realized that was so tough on me he just flipped his snack to things like cheese, and jerky... things that if I felt the desire overcome me I could have. Best thing ever! 
You deserve to grab your health and happiness tightly in your hand and not let go. You said he was supportive otherwise... my guess is he just doesn‚Äôt realize the situation. 
In every loving relationship the fear of a health scare is a powerful motivator... maybe an honest approach and and an open playin field on the snack couch will make it work for you and sooth his fears!! 
You got this!!! And cheers!"
