Your contract is a Standard Contract because when I tried to join it said it was in a different league. Good luck!"

depression,fab80bz,t3_e8anzg,1575919147.0,"The last time I remember relating to people my own age in general, I was in preschool.

After that I was the child who hangs out with the adults or older kids. But I honestly think that has less to do with age groups than being with people who are just what's expected of them. In the end the friends I have made through the years have been older, my age or younger but it's more about not seeing age as having any real part of it. Friends come from shared interests and while some of that is cultural and community based, I think the more real stuff is just person by person, based on their experiences."
depression,f9vwav4,t3_e6wilf,1575681495.0,"The last few months every morning is like this. If I can, I go back to sleep, because why bother getting up? My kitties are old and honestly sleeping together is basically our main past time at this point so I don't really feel bad about it even from that perspective. If anything in my dreams we play and we're home with the people we've loved and even if it's not those dreams it's not this life. A lot of days it feels like this is the nightmare and sleep is the real thing."
Needafriend,f92an65,t3_e35blh,1575021054.0,"I just moved back from London, but it was the only place I've ever really felt like I belonged. I made friends for the first time there through Meetup.com and I really recommend looking through it, finding any that sound like what you like and giving some a shot. 

I know with the social anxiety its hard. The place I made my friends, the first time I went, I walked in and immediately walked out again. But I was desperate for friends (I'd found Meetup by literally asking Google, how do I make friends in London) and I told myself I'd never have friends if I kept living like that and those ended up being the happiest years of my life. 

I was in my mid-30s when I finally made friends, it's never to late to try. And there's so many people in London, from everywhere and with so many interests and you guys have an amazing transport system that makes it so much easier, too. 

I wish you luck, a lot of the friends I made through my Meetup also suffer from social anxiety and other things. I wish I could be back there to invite you on a hike. I loved hiking through the English countryside around London. If you have any questions or want to chat, feel free to ping me, but I'm on PST now. >.<"
Needafriend,f929vuc,t3_e3a9al,1575019854.0,"Keep trying and putting yourself out there. I think we're all meant to have friends, but I know what you mean when you see the pictures of girls with their squads. I was engaged and one of the main reasons I didn't want a wedding was because I had no friends for a wedding party, no one to be my Maid of Honor or a bridesmaid. I found a place where I made girl friends and even then I still couldn't imagine having that girl group, though I wish I could. I didn't find those friends until I was in my mid-30s and had moved half-way across the world and now I'm not there anymore, but I know if I need to talk I have friends who will be there for me, when they wake up >.<. I hope it doesn't take you as long or as much effort. 

But I don't think its good for us to rely on our husbands to be our only friends. Also, if we can be friends with our husbands, we can make other friends. And I think we can still have friends, need friends, even if it won't be like other people. Hopefully, the little one will help give you a reason to get out there. You'll both need friends. 

I'm new to posting etc. but if you ever want to talk I'm here. This making friends thing is just so weird I don't think I'll ever really get it, but I'll keep trying and I hope you do, too."
