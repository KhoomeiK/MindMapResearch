There's no happy medium with all of this. As soon as people heard the state of emergency they instantly thought ""GOTTA GET THE BREAD AND MILK!!!!!"". The stores are empty, and everyone is angry at the media for saying something in the first place. The panic lingers in the air, and it's quite eerie. 

But then you have the other people who think that this is all blown out of proportion. They'll be fine, so who cares, right? More people die of the flu, people should just get the vaccine. Learn to kill your own food if you're really that worried about it. The National Guard isn't involved yet, so it can't be that bad. They say ""Just go back to work!!!""

School is closed for 3 weeks, restaurants have to offer take out or delivery only (no dining in), work from home if possible, close if you can. This takes into effect tomorrow, so I don't know who is going to stay open and who isn't. Most of the places in my area are thing's that have to stay open. I work at a local hospital and my department (food service) has no back up plan, or if they do, they haven't told us anything. My co-workers and I are left in the dark and are slightly concerned for us, as well as the safety of the other hospital staff and patients that we see daily. 

It's all just an odd feeling to me. All we know are the unknowns and people are taking this as an opportunity to be selfish, whether it be panic or neglect."

One of the cooks kept asking me for help with prep, and I didn‚Äôt mind at all! It was something I already had to do for myself, so why not just do an extra one. Team work right? 

About 2 weeks later of helping out this cook with the littlest stuff I got pulled into the office and was screamed at because the cook was taking advantage of me and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to help anyone any more because my niceness was hindering other workers. They‚Äôve also told me my niceness in preventing me from moving up at work, which was another awesome conversation to have."

Ps, when it rains, nothing helps. Have fun! :D‚Äù"

work,etmdm62,t3_ccaj1j,1562957552.0,"I work food service/customer service. I work with one other coworker alone 90% of the time. This woman is the most miserable in the world, I swear. She hates dealing with customers to the point where she‚Äôll let them know with her body language. Rolling her eyes, huffing, mumbling under her breath. We have a system at night where I deal with customers and she does whatever she does. And even then she has issues with the customers. She always tells me I‚Äôm too nice or too sweet, almost like they don‚Äôt deserve good service. And watching her take care of customers hurts my heart. She‚Äôll lie to them saying we‚Äôre out of something just so she doesn‚Äôt have to do it. (One time I didn‚Äôt know, I served someone something and she called me a bitch for opening that door instead of leaving it shut). 

Not to mention she‚Äôs old. She absolutely hates my generation. She hates cell phones and computers and thinks all the young kids are too sensitive and politically correct. And she‚Äôs racist. It takes everything in me not to scream at her in front of people.

Also, we work in a hospital. She hates the nurses. She thinks all they do is sit on their phones and ignore patients. She thinks they make way too much money for ‚Äúhow little‚Äù work they do. 
It‚Äôs not just one thing, this is a continuous thing that happens. Every. Single. Day."
AskReddit,et6kpvc,t1_et5yjmf,1562514606.0,"Just to add, the stress from all of that effects your physical health as well. Because when you neglect all of those things, you don't sit around in relief going ""ahh, I didn't have to do *that* today so I feel sooooo relaxed!"". You sit there and stress *because* you know you have to do it, but you can't. And that can cause your immune system to weaken, making it more easy for you to get sick, or stay sick longer. Or you end up getting shingles at the ripe old age of 17 and continue to have nerve damage almost 10 years later..."
work,esyrqmf,t3_c9fj7h,1562348243.0,"This is my boss pretty much too. She only targets the ""weakest"" which she describes as the shy and sensitive. Which apparently is me. It's awful. I have no other choice at the moment but to work in my department (trying to save money to move on). She's nothing but a narcissistic bully who preys on the quiet and reserved. She's threatened to make me cry in front of the entire hospital (I work food service there) and she has a great way with twisting words around. Gaslighting is something shes awesome at. I get called into the office more times than I should just because she needs a punching bag. The only reason why I stay is my co workers. I love them all, without them I would have quit two months into my employment and now I'm going on 2 years. 

Currently having an issue with her because I'm out on medical, and before I left she said I was milking this whole situation. I had surgery and she was mad that I wasn't going to be back after 48 hours. I'm terrified to go back because shes going to harass me. And HR has done nothing to help, so I get that too. I'm looking for ans and easy second job so I can get more money faster so I can get out and move away from that toxic place. 

Good luck on your adventures away from there! I hope it works out for the best!"
