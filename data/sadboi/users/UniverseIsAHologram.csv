The first daughter is named after the father's mother, the second after the mother's mother. So big Italian families would have all the grandchildren running around with the same names. The tradition was kept even in the US, and it led to bullying and a lot of mispronunciations and even misgendering (her male cousin was named Adrian). My mom's generation is the one that finally broke it because sometimes traditions die and there are some names you don’t want your kids having. My mom's father actually told her to never name her son after him because he hated his name (which is kinda funny cuz she made it my brother's middle name and his friends loved it so much they used it as a nickname for a while).
