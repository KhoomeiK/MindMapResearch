NarcissisticAbuse,fr430tc,t1_fr36bzs,1589874092.0,"I relate to this 100%. I begged for him to just love or care for me. He was just incapable. I wish I would’ve known so many years ago how toxic that motherfucker was. Years of my life he stole from me, wonderful years with my sons raising them while that fucker constantly beat me down in a million different ways. 

The silver lining is that he’s dead and I’ll never put up with that treatment again."
NarcissisticAbuse,fr42kvk,t1_fr3m3mg,1589873666.0,"Honestly giving you the ‘out’ of him cheating might have really benefitted you. My husband cheated on me and after a few years of it I was finally able to leave, and his cheating gave me a justification that he could understand. It was a brutal BRUTAL divorce with a restraining order and police involvement... just brutal. 

When the next woman he dated tried to leave him.... he literally stalked her and killed her in a rage. When I talked to him when he was in jail, he told me he just couldn’t understand why she would leave.... that he understood why I finally left but he couldn’t accept or understand why SHE would leave. I will always be grateful to the cliche receptionist he cheated on me with, and then murdered. She gave me an out. 

I too cannot trust men.... it’s been 12 years since the divorce and 9 years since the murder. My sons and I are all incredibly successful people, running a successful business and we are super close, but I can’t imagine putting myself in a vulnerable position again with any man. That man brutalized me physically and emotionally and I have nightmares years later of him stalking me or chasing me down. That fucker damaged me and I’ve worked so hard to move beyond it. It’s been very, very difficult. He committed suicide while in jail, the complete turning away of everyone in his life just devastated him- even his own mother wouldn’t visit him. Thank you for reading this. I’m sorry if this was off topic. Thank you all for sharing your story, it’s been years of trying to understand and unwind what happened to me and my family. I cannot tell you how much his death has benefitted me."

Private catholic school is a waste and there is a finite amount of money. Spending those tuition dollars on undergraduate education would be a much probably better use of those monies. 

This completely is Independant of the ridiculous focus on a storybook of fairy tales that those kids are spoon fed every day of the lives, on top of needing to ‘confess their sins’. Pffft. SMH.

I personally believe that indoctrinating your kids into catholic school is a form of child abuse, those kids are taught every day to fear the boogeyman watching to make sure they don’t masturbate or think impure thoughts. It’s really damaging and can take years to unwind the dysfunction from that experience. Even worse if a kid is ... wait for it.... gay, trans, different, or a variety of different things. YEARS to unwind that damage. 

Good luck to you and your family. Taking on 4 kids even in the best of times is a huge undertaking."

I’ve honestly found I am much, much happier without having an overgrown man child to have to deal with. I don’t have to deal with the snoring, farting, nasal issues, dysfunctional step kids, financial problems, draining ‘crazy’ ex spouses, infidelity, anger management issues, constant messes, the list goes on. 

I’ve found that men and women look for very different things and I personally have not found a man who is remotely worth the work of carving out a space in my life for. I have great male friends, wonderful people. But bringing one into my life as a partner? Pass. 

I am very fortunate that I am also very capable and manage a fairly successful small business in the US. I straight up do not need a man to support myself and truthfully have not found that the benefit of having a partner is worth it. I have worked my tail off for years and would much rather be successful in business by serving my customers and community than have to rely on a man to support me. 

I’ll be over here eating croissants with my kind, loyal, accomplished, hard working and very impressive female friends.

It’s just not worth the aggravation.... the inevitable disappointment..... the tax on my mental health..... the mind games..... the lying. To say nothing of the baggage that comes with step kids who have their own massive issues themselves that need to be dealt with and managed. 

I want to clarify that I am highly, highly successful and have great, very kind and productive grown sons. This is not an issue of me being a spinster that cant find a man. 

The issue is that for the most case, what single men have to offer me is just not worth the risk and aggravation. I’ve selected to become my own best friend and have amazing female friends that are highly accomplished and have my back. 

Good luck out there- don’t mean to be a downer but seriously - taking yourself off the dating scene and being a happy and productive single woman is just about the best thing ever.

Edit- the final nail was when a man who I was head over heels for.... well I went through images he had sent me of himself and zoomed in.... and saw a wedding ring. That one ate up about 2 years for me and was really difficult to get around. After that one, I pivoted and made a conscious decision to just not even get out there.

HarveyWeinstein,fge7v9m,t3_exg5ph,1580693359.0,Ronan Farrow is an American hero. Thanks for the suggestion- when I get time I’ll listen to his podcasts but even a quick read of his Wiki page shows what an absolute unit of a justice warrior he is.

getting_over_it,fg9dm5z,t3_exje5f,1580637415.0,"I’m very sorry this happened to you. My husband suicided when my kids were little and left us alone, exposed, and in a very vulnerable situation 9 years ago. His suicide was very public and our entire community knew what happened. It. Was. Awful.

That being said, I’m no psychologist, only a layperson who has been on the other side of this. I really hope you can back way WAY away from your Dad.... his toxic, selfish behavior is inexcusable. What he did to you is really unforgivable. What. A. DICK. 

Truthfully I’m happy for you that in the face of being raised by someone who is so incredibly narcissistic and self absorbed, that you seem pretty ok. You’re clearly a strong and capable person.  I hope you feel better soon. 

If it’s any consolation to you, my kids and I are all highly successful people in spite of what their dad did. I seek out - continuously - different professionals to learn and develop strategies to stay positive and strong.  I also have a therapist I see regularly who is super sharp and has been very supportive. 

What your Dad did to you would cripple most people... and look at you now... going strong, making good stuff happen, and reaching out to learn how to live life better. The trauma that guy put you through is absolutely inexcusable. 

Good luck to you, feel free to DM me if you want an ear to listen to you."
cancer,fg9a8xi,t3_exkls7,1580636173.0,"I am so sorry you lost your Mom. She seems like a very special person and it sounds like she loved you a lot. I am very, very sorry for your pain. My husband died when my kids were 9 and 12, so my sons grew up without a Dad, too. I understand your sadness. I wish I had better advice to help you, all I can say is to spend time with your Dad if he is good to you and you like him. Hopefully you have aunts or cousins or a nice grandma?  I will keep you in my thoughts and I’m sending you hugs over the internet. May peace find you and your family."
datingoverthirty,fg98g5j,t3_exgod6,1580635540.0,"Well... I’ve perused your post history. Posting pictures of people who are trying to find connections via OLD, and making fun of their appearance kind of makes you seem like a total dick. Maybe I’m wrong but seems like finding a well of kindness and compassion for women... even ones with questionable eyebrows, is something you could work on. It seems to me that you are just not a very nice person. 

Straight up, reading posts from men like you is why I have removed myself completely from the market. I very rarely come across a man who holds a candle to most of my female friends, who are generally both attractive and very, very accomplished people. And who don’t spend time having a laugh at someone else’s expense, and sharing embarrassing photos of them on Reddit. 

I don’t know but if it always smells like shit, you probably need to look at your own shoes."
VACCINES,fg8x6ls,t1_fg8o7ev,1580631010.0,"That’s classic fear mongering....noeone has died from my super healthy sons staying unvaccinated.... you’re just parroting what you hear over and over from the media or whatever source you use to digest information.  Good luck to you, my involvement with this conversation is done."
VACCINES,fg8nzq6,t1_fg8m9xs,1580626052.0,"Politely, we can agree to disagree. My decisions for my precious and beloved sons was the right decision for us.  They are now 18 and 22 and both are  healthy, happy and mentally well. I also absolutely do NOT get flu shots either. Shockingly..... I’ve never had the flu. Shrug."
VACCINES,fg8ljeq,t1_fg8gmxq,1580623394.0,"Shrug. You do you. I personally know a family who suffered terribly from vaccine injury. I chose not to vaccinate my sons, who are now adults, very healthy, and highly, highly motivated and successful. We made the right decision for us. 

Truthfully I believe that my youngest son would have been negatively impacted had he received his massive amounts of injections.... starting from before he even left the hospital after I gave birth. The doctors wanted to give him a hepatitis vaccine before leaving the hospital. Just friggin ridiculous. A perfect, beautiful and healthy baby needing to get an injection to protect against..... hepatitis? Smh. No thanks. 

Good luck to everyone out there."
