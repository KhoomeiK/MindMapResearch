BPD,filvpnd,t3_f8gl6u,1582511482.0,"I’m a radiation protection technician at a nuclear power plant. I like the job but it’s difficult at times. 
There I times that I need to be more assertive when I’m covering a job. I still really struggle with that."
BPD,fhlgai7,t1_fhee578,1581700363.0,I wish I had the ability to stick up for myself. I avoid conflict at all costs.
BPD,fhlf230,t3_f2z7up,1581700008.0,"I feel exactly the same way. I’m an actor in the play of life. 
I’m a reasonably successful person with a good family. 
I objectively give and do more than I should around co-workers or strangers so they can SEE that I’m a good person in hopes that I receive acceptance and approval. 
I can’t say that I’m nearly as good to my family as I am to strangers. 
And I have no idea who or what I really am."
BPD,fhlavtt,t3_f3t9yr,1581698089.0,"For me it was a combination of hating myself or my inability to communicate my feelings properly and in a fucked up way also another attempt to physically show the depth of my pain to another person. 
Like I can’t understand myself or my feelings much less explain what’s going on inside so maybe carving it into my skin will help them understand?  
Then I was ashamed and also knew it was a manipulative action but I’m confused and in pain and desperate for understanding. 

It’s not dumb. Well it is dumb, but YOU are not dumb. I wish I had some great advice for you but all I have to offer is some understanding. I don’t self harm anymore. Well not like that at least. I hope you can find your way out of the dark. We’re around and we hear you."
BPD,fhl8tz0,t3_f3gzvk,1581697135.0,The worst part is when somebody takes offense to the things you’ve said by misinterpreting it. Then they’re mad at you. Or maybe I’m just reading too deep into it. I should just stop talking. Why do I even try. I just want them to like me.

eczema,f5fy2yp,t1_f5fl201,1572187849.0,I do something similar. I mix eczema cream in a travel size of Vaseline. It keeps it from drying on my face and and looking even worse. It helps keep the moisture while also applying the medicine. I generally have more of a psoriasis issue on my face but I find this helps me.

ChernobylTV,f3b7eq5,t1_f3arzm3,1570803574.0,Also realize that contamination is physical radioactive material and not radiation. Contamination is dog shit... radiation is the smell. It’s a lot easier to clean a plant than it is to clean the natural environment.
ChernobylTV,f3b79ab,t1_f3b1cck,1570803466.0,I think that was for the workers building the sarcophagus. Not sure if that’s what the plant workers did.

Something must be wrong with the Bluetooth though. My wife and I both got iPhone 11 pro max phones and I can’t connect and trade to my Nintendo switch with either phone."
PokemonGoSpoofing,ezzugtm,t1_ezyd4pn,1568293121.0,"I was going to purchase two. But then it only asked for one Apple ID even though I put quantity as two. The shipping cost 1/3 of the product cost so I wanted to get one for me and my wife but I don’t that I trust they’ll give me what I need to connect to the TestFlight beta app for another id. 
I might just decide to figure out cydia impactor and whatever and use ispoofer. 
I just wanted to find something safe enough to use my main account on. But if I’m going to use an alt I might as well get the extra ispoofer features."
PokemonGoSpoofing,ezztu2l,t1_ezyo1wz,1568292867.0,"Do you think it would be better to just use ispoofer?  I’d like to use something on my main account and itools mobile seems safer. But honestly I was going to start an alt account anyways at least to begin with.  So maybe I should just try ispoofer out instead..?
I would have purchased itools mobile months ago if their website wasn’t so terrible. It doesn’t inspire confidence. 
You can’t buy multiple products in a cart. There are a ton of ghost links that you can’t get to from the main site. It’s like a webpage in 2001 if I’m being generous."
PokemonGoSpoofing,ezzt7ao,t1_ezz9jfr,1568292590.0,So you use it on one and then connect to another and hit the raid up?
PokemonGoSpoofing,ezym903,t1_ezyd4pn,1568270640.0,"Yeah and I would have to get the lightning extended cord with it so i could charge my phone with the dongle but also not have to worry about breaking it. 

I could just see myself walking away from the device and it reverts back to my phone gps. 

I heard when you unplug the dongle it takes awhile for your phone gps to kick back on. Is that true?

I’m hoping some more people comment so I can decide."
ChernobylTV,eqqo7hb,t3_bmljfn,1560226520.0,"It’s like a factory. But a lot cleaner. Security guards with assault rifles (even though I don’t like that descriptor usually for a rifle, but as to not get too detailed).
Different maintenance departments and work planning. 
Ops pushes water around, makes steam, runs the plant. 
Radiation Protection surveys rooms and documents dose rates and contamination levels. Assists during valve breaches or any other opening or maintenance on contaminated systems. 

And human performance is highly stressed. Kind of like when you see pilots using a checklist and verbalizing what they’re doing. We take huge steps to prevent any human errors and ensure every action is purposeful and intentional. 

I’m overall pleased and lucky to be a part of the industry."
