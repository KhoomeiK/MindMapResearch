I know you mean well, I do. But I've seen my future. And it won't get better, it took me 26 years to find the love of my life, only for life to tell me ""No, it will never happen"" - My grandma supported her children by herself, no family to aid her, no family to support her. My mother, supported me, my disabled brother and my mentally unwell aunt. No support from family when my grandma died, and no support when my aunt died. There's a trend here, Grandma, Mom, all dealt with life *alone*, and somehow found the strength to keep going. I inherited my father's cowardice, I'm not strong enough to deal with my mom's eventual passing, nor do I have any real financial support. I dropped out of school due to my depression and anxiety and I can't get a good job.  

> but you must remember hope is your greatest weapon

I had hope, I had hoped that the love of my life would see me as I do her, but she can't, and She's tried.. so hard to return that love but can't. We spoke a day ago about it, and it was pretty final. There is no chance of something happening, and honestly, that's what woke me to reality of me facing loss and death alone. And I don't want to. 

> Do not be afraid of the pain and suffering that will come, for it is nothing compared to the pain of the consequence to your actions that will be bestowed upon your friends, mother, and little brother. They will feel distraught, miserable, and, like you have now, lose hope. Please, don’t kill yourself.

But I am afraid, I'm simply not enough. Not for love, not for enduring hardships. Deep down? I am a coward, and I run at the first sign of trouble. But this isn't normal trouble is it. I'm faced with certain pain and loss and I rather not face it alone. I'm trying not to think about the pain my friends and my family will face at my passing, but I **know** that they are strong enough to endure this. They will recover, they will survive me. 

I'm planning on staying awake all day, my friends usually get on discord around ahh 11pm.

> You saying it feels like you were fated to kill yourself hit hard. I don’t know if I feel like I was born with that as my only path but I definitely feel like the only way I’ll ever die is by killing myself or leading myself to death such as alcoholism.

I feel the same, I honestly believe the only thing that will kill me is me. No freak accident, no natural death, just me. I will cause my death. And I relate to the alcoholism; I don't drink as much as I feel I should considering how fucked I am, but no, my vice is smoking. So, Cancer, really. And that runs in my family. I find it somewhat morbidly funny, my friend, E. She was going through cancer before I lied to her. It'd be poetic if I got cancer and died from it. I died from cancer and my friendship was killed by me being cancer. 

> I’ve gotten to the point where I’m really hoping there’s no god because what sick fuck would seal me to this oblivion.

There is no God, only Death. Closest thing we have to a God is death. Since it comes for everything. But if there is an actual God like most religions like to vomit on about, then.. there's a moral/ethical issue with a being creating us this way."

SuicideWatch,f9v74n0,t1_f9tvt7o,1575664299.0,"> I get it, I feel the same way, like I’m in a cycle that will never be broken, like I’m so trapped with no escape from this despair. I constantly just sit there wishing I was dead. It makes me want to scream, or cry, or anything but instead I just sit there with a blank stare. I feel like I can’t tell anyone but at the same time it feels like I need to get the words out. It’s a weird feeling and one that unfortunately you and me are all too familiar with.

yes! this! exactly, fuck. It's not a feeling I'd wish on anyone. and it does bum me out that I'm not the only one who feels that way. And it was only recently, that I figured out that fact; I am in a cycle, a never ending one.. seemingly

> On the bright side, you said you’re afraid it will cause you to kill yourself meaning that you want to be alive.

I think you're right, I guess it probably stems from that small spark of hope. Hope that the things I want could materialize, forgiveness, a opportunity to fix my wrongs, gain back what I've lost, break this stupid, shitty cycle. But I'm so fucking sick that a major part of me wants that hope to be snuffed out. Just so the mental confliction dies, and I'm free of that pain. 

> If you have a certain pill bottle or method that you’d kill yourself with, maybe write a note to yourself so that you don’t make any hasty decisions.

I do, I'm stockpiling pills, I don't have enough. I've done research on the amount it would take to kill me. I've read cases of overdoes and deaths on this particular med. I set a deadline, Sometime in June. So it coincides with the day I lied. as a means of cementing the idea that what killed me was *my lie*. So, I have until then, assuming I have the right amount at that time. Hell, I even managed to innocently ask my docs to change my meds from one a night to two a night. this is the most serious I've been about killing myself, it's so.. premeditated, it's scary. I write often in my journal, so there's several notes. 

> You want to live but feel like you can’t escape the guilt. You’ll find a way, don’t give up on your life if you want to be alive because you can work past this. It’s not the end, so don’t let it be.

I just can't let go of the idea, that corrosive, damning idea that *this should be the end*. Because I feel like I will lie again, to new friends, to family. It'll never end, unless I make it end. Sometimes, I feel like, from birth, I was fated to kill myself. Of course, that's bullshit nonsense, but I'm so ill that *it feels true*. And the concept that I could beat this seems.. folly. impossible, fuck, I am really really sick."

I know, and you're right but I can't. Everytime I interact with my friend, or my parent, or even a doctor. I wanna yell ""Help me, I need help"" but I don't, I really do need to get past this but I just can't. And I'm scared, scared that what I've said is true and that no matter what I do, I won't ever get this cycle broken. I'm scared I'm actually going to kill myself. 

> I’m in a similar situation, holding on to something that I just can’t get past and it’s ripping me apart. I need to listen to my own advice and move past it. We both need to move on from what has happened or else we’ll always feel this despair.

That's what I'm afriad of, that this despair will only grow and eventually kill me. But there's nothing I can do. I need help, but won't ask. I don't know if that's me, or that's just the guilt 

> Dark feelings seem to flow in and out from day to day, week to week, month to month. You’ll get past this. We’ll find a way for both of us. Somehow we will.

I hope you do, as for me? my own fear feels like a confirmation that the only way I'll find a way is by OD'in, finally killing the monster that I am"

She used similar words last we spoke, and I don't know why it's such a issue to me. It's something.. I don't know! I'm stuck on it. and on the other hand.. I'll be honest; a massive part of my guilt has been lifted. It's like, since both wronged parties have now addressed the incident, one forgiving me and the other not. It's like, it's not such a huge burden anymore.
