Does she want to go through this virus alone? That's odd to me, why wouldn't you want the support of your partner during a time like this? 

I think roots are likely deeper and reasons miscommunicated. 

One possibility but something you should certainly bring up with her if you think it's the case, is that to whatever extend -big or small- she sees you as adding to what she has to ""handle""

If she feels burdened, (harsh word) or that by being with you she had to put more effort into things, maybe this virus,  the distance and lack of knowing when she will see you. She could have looked at it as a means to an end, that when she finally met you something would change in your dynamic that makes maybe the general distance easier. 

If you've not met yet this is more likely because of the uncertainty and societies expectations and input. 

I'm only guessing based on things my fellow LDR friends have expressed in their relationships. Although the main thing I'd recommend is ask her what's changed, where her minds at. 

Encourage honesty and do your best to listen without judgments."

Now, you gotta queue even in store and only walk one way. like pick your stuff up along the way and please don't double back because it inconveniences everyone +keep distance.

NEET,fjcmtpj,t3_fcr1ge,1583227113.0,"I live with my parents and since I was a kid, our dynamic has never changed. 

My father stopped trying to have a healthy functioning relationship with me when I was 11 after my sister was born. I suppose he decided to choose favourites.  

My mother never liked my company growing up and we didn't connect, talk or bond until after my nan (her mother) died. I'd just turned 17. 

My nan was the primary person I depended on, but her favourite was my brother, very obviously her favourite with how much I couldn't do/have in comparison to him. 

When I became neet, it didn't change anything in my family dynamic really. Both my parents have never worked whilst I was alive and so it was the most normal thing to me. (We have neetbux due to disability) 

Whilst my mother (or any of my family) has never said ""love you"" it's done through acts of service or just acknowledgment i suppose. So my mothers the only one I've got a bond with in terms of parents. 

My father and I have a very stagnant and nonexistent relationship.  He's very entitled and expects everything his way or he will legit throw a tantrum. He once stole my milkshake and held it captive because I evidently ate a fruit that was sitting in the -everyone pile- because it was his. He wanted me to walk several miles to a closing store to buy him a new one without money because he wouldn't eat anything else. 

Plenty of other food, he wouldn't have eaten it right now anyways. He just loves complaining. -_- just imagine swearing and condemning his daughter's existence for days over some fruit HE misplaced. It's been a month and he still brings it up. 

Eh... and I hate to be self reflective and aware, but I've certainly got some of my fathers traits. (Minus the captive milkshake, that was fucking ridiculous) 

I don't think my parents are supportive in any emotional way. They'll help me with general tasks by doing it for me (my mother when I say they) so I've never had to do it myself and when I'm expected to, they've never put me in a position where I've been equipt to do so. 

I was an accident, but all of us were. Doesn't really matter besides context that my family were never really prepared to have 3 kids."
INTP,fjclr6u,t3_fcri4k,1583225633.0,">but, then I realized I really don't have any redeeming qualities.

This is a real callback to my teenage years, man I was unhealthy also back then and still am working on my ""victim"" mentality. 

One thing I found that helped me develop out of it, was understanding my unhealthy impulses and tracking down the thinking pattern, then employing a -way I'd like to think- as a default that I'd reinforce time and time again until it became second nature. 

My Fe learned a lot because I'd constantly ask for feedback on how people felt, how people would see my actions so that I could grasp the different aspects of my own behaviour better. 

Restructuring thought patterns is time consuming.  My current boyfriend -INTJ checked out some of the old posts I made on social media. 

He remarked about how much I changed in a year based on what he read, like he nearly didn't grasp how someone could be like that, and then be like this without it being all a facade. 

So its effective if you understand the fundamentals of your mind and can actively implement them into your daily routine.

They may forget to see you as a normal person, or someone whom can think rationally because they're looking at you always a bit cynical of ""are you over reacting again?"" 

I think sometimes you have to remind some of these friends that whilst you may struggle more than most, it doesn't mean you're incapable or blind to your own behaviour or situation. 

It can be tricky from both sides, for you whom has the condision to feel a certain way, possibly being critical of yourself already, only to then have the people around you openly question your intentions. 

To your friends trying to conclude between how to help you best, assuming this is your condition, or believing you intent the worst because their view isn't always the clearest either.

As women can orgasm during rape. Whilst its unwanted and by all means traumatizing. The body can respond and I suppose some can derive pleasure from it. 

Due to gaining pleasure from it, I think this adds to the guilt factor a women may feel.

Yeah I communication to feel at ease. 

I want to talk to people, express myself here and there. I mostly listen to other people express myself and that gives me satisfaction. I'm female btw. 

I've gone about a month without communicating more than good mornings and good nights with my family. Very passive talk and completely forgetting to talk to my primary social group that was online. 

When I get carried away with a game, I'll vanish off the face of the earth for weeks as I play every scenario of rimworld known to mankind. (I have about 2 thousand hours on rimworld) 

I do think women have more opportunities to socialise than men. We are simply expected to and pursued for that purpose more. 

My male friends can game and do their own thing without being messaged more than twice a week. Whilst if I was to observe female friends,  I'd estimate their communication with others as more than twice that. Expression levels much much higher. 

The stoic nature of what men are expected of deprives them in many cases of intimate friendships and relations. 

Whilst women are perceived as nearly the goal to gain such intimacy. But women being such a focal point means they're getting this need met more often than their male counter part. 

I find it interesting how the two work, why they work. Because human nature is incredibly intriguing. Understanding its fundamentals means we can navigate through the harder aspects."
NEET,ff1s4c4,t3_eq9ux6,1579484956.0,"Female NEET here. 

I used to comment a fair bit on this sub, but after getting into a relationship some months back, I got quite side tracked from most media I'd use. 

I think the reason the population of men being neets is so high may contribute to the fact women aren't as badly stigmatized when they're neets. 

Women can be housewives and in some cultures that's their primary purpose. 

However men, from my understanding its entirely their purpose to provide for their families. 

The nature of humans can be unfair asf. 

Women are attracted to men whom can provide. 

Thus a man needs to work to provide.

Men are attracted to women whom show the best health and potential for birthing the best offspring. 

Thus men tend to look for looks.

This is overly simplified as to how attraction works but even this effects a lot in society

Basically what this suggests is theres more focus on men being productive than women. Whilst its stigmatised either way for most, men will have a harder time. 

But yeah, neet female.  Its stigmatised where I am in the uk. But I can say for sure I'm pretty lucky."

So some innocent looking stranger might pass this simply normal human until they see slight lip movements, grins, smirks of amusement and an evil glare that just flickers up... notices the now stunned women. Head turns away with a blank, expressionless indifference.  

God forbid the thing looks behind her, because I sure as hell still have my eye on her. 

Learning to I hermit facial expression backfires, because we just don't know when the right time is to practice it 😂"

Many of us are neets due to disability or mental health.

Which in turn can be stigmatized, looked down etc. Some peeps just cripple in work settings and depend on their families for support. Lucky buggers get welfare. 

However. Being a NEET isn't inherently bad like many of the comments suggest. It's how you live the NEET existence and whether it's for you or not. 

Personally I like being a NEET, it truly is a sense of freedom for me. 

Alike anything in life, it'll have it's negatives, but that's where you go about fixing and balancing out those aspects. 

You can have a job and no friends, which could be shit. 

Same with being NEET. 

So long as you manage your life respectfully within your own needs, wants etc and awareness. 

Enjoy~ 

Btw~ sorry you only got 1-2 of free time, I can't imagine how exhausting that is!"

RimWorld,erm3ydx,t3_c2r7sb,1561005296.0,"Consider playing in temperate forest. 

Usually picking -All year growing seasons. (Don't have to)

Don't recruit more than you can feed unless it's a necessity. 

Make a fridge and stock up!  (Make a room and coolers. Red end facing out and blue end in. Then set them to -5c bigger the room the more coolers )

No more pets until you have enough food to feed them/your colonists. 

Build base kill box/defences for your base. 

Keep a close eye on your colonists needs and when you get that extra time, spend time on it. Once ""very low expectations"" is gone from their needs, you'll need to manage it in other ways. 

Set restricted areas for your colonists when attacks or emergencies happen by using (zones) and just restricting them when need be to the relevant locations you need them at. 

Build your base primarily out of stone. (Non flamable) 

Consider getting a nutrapaste despencer. Or put your cooking station close to the fridge. 

Manually set priorities, 1 is being most important in order of left to right. Best to use one specific colonists to do a certain task. No multitasking when possible, have them specialize. 

This should sum up most of what I'd assume would be relevant for beginners 🤔 

Hope it helps."

NEET,er5aobk,t3_c0gs6m,1560521947.0,"Being a NEET has both pros and cons. 

Personally I'm a NEET whom enjoys many elements of being a NEET. 

It may not be perfect, but no job is perfect either. Everything in life has good and bad associated with it. 

Back in high school and collage, managing people, my emotional and mental state was pretty difficult. It lead me to feeling numb from having so much go on around me. 

It stressed me to the point I wasn't living, just surviving. It took all the joy and fufillment out of everything I did. 

But since being a NEET, it's removed the stress. I get easily anxious and paranoid, always have done. Whilst my paranoia has gone up, my anxiety has plummeted and isn't nearly as bad. 

I suppose I fear going back into that state where I have to be so on task that my mind shuts down again. 

It never helps when the people around you consider it normal, or simply a trivial thing because they don't experience the same reaction. 

It invalidates the hard work you put in, it does not get recognised. 

I'd rather do what I know benefits me emotionally and mentally. so long as I have food and a roof over my head, my family as company and internet to ensure my social skills don't degrade, then I'm good."
