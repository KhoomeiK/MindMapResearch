I've noticed some blotches and bleeds specifically at the gold part of the right cape piece, around the buckle, the gold at the arm, the blotch at the back of the cape, and around the sock area.

The face piece isnt glossy and cheap looking like from what I commonly see in bootleg, and most of the main pieces feel quite substantial and legit. The sword at the hip seems to fall off a little too easily, but it's not too big of a problem and it may just be a design fault.

2. Suffering from a disorder that is completely separate from BPD has naught to do with this. See how you're trying you make this about you? Much as you have my condolences for the shit your sister and you are going through, it has nothing to do with the case at hand. It's a fucking post on the im14 subreddit. Most of these people are going through a phase in life. What, didn't study this in your college course?

3. I'm mad at uneducated pricks like you trying to act like smartasses and spreading misinformation about mental health. I never ruled out the probability that she suffers from a mental disorder, but why not propose every teenager who's going through their identity-confusion stage suffers from ASPD? You don't just say hey maybe she's psychologically ill based off of one text message.

4. Don't try and utilise an appeal to pity. You weren't asking for empathy for anybody, you were just projecting your own problems.

5. Many people see psychologists and undergo counseling sessions despite not suffering from any disorders. You don't need to be mentally ill to meet a psychologist.

6. Just-world bias. If the parents brought her to multiple psychologists, she must have psychological issues. That's not how it works. A lot of parents are just concerned about their children and possess no knowledge on the field. It's really not that difficult to believe parents send their moody teenagers for counseling sessions out of concern.

7. Stop resorting to situational attribution to justify yourself. Why indeed is it that everytime you suggest someone on the internet whom you've never met or talked to suffers from a psychological disorder probably without even consulting the fucking DSM, someone calls you out for it? Has it occurred to you that maybe it's because what you're doing - playing the online psychologist is irrational? We're not talking about depressive disorders or anxiety disorders. BPD is relatively rare - what are the odds this random 14 years-old person you know naught about has it?"
im14andthisisdeep,fbwqino,t1_fbweipo,1577156763.0,"1. Sounds a lot like someone's projecting their relationship insecurities onto someone else here.

2. Do you even know what BPD is? Going on Psychology Today and listing me the symptoms isn't an exhibition of your understanding, by the way. Do you know why psychologists don't diagnose people under 18 with most disorders? It's because adjustment issues are plentiful and common throughout a person's childhood and teenagehood and it's easy to force fit most teenagers or children with adjustment issues as victims of psychological disorders. Furthermore, we still have a lot of neuroplasticity then - relative recovery is very much possible.

3. Regardless of whether or not you do, the instant anybody attempts to make a diagnosis on the internet without even ever having talked to the subject in question, they've basically invalidated any future say they have in anything mental health-related.

4. Advising caution based off of your observation? What bloody observation? A DM screenshot? ONE DM screenshot? Bruh.

5. She's likely 14 or somewhere along the line. It's called a psychosocial developmental stage. Many people were at one point overdramatic edgy candidates for this subreddit. We either successfully resolve said stages and grow out of them, or we fall to and end up with issues. Also, you've failed to provide a reason for me to trust your irrational diagnosis over the several psychologists she has allegedly met.

I hate to be the party pooper, but the albeit fun exchange we've been entertaining ourselves with above is NOT quantum mechanics. I'm no expert myself, but quantum mechanics relies greatly on mathematics, statistics, theorems and other really boring stuff I think most of us or even the world wouldn't be able to fathom or work out - when most people talk about things QM is most known for like superposition, quantum tunneling, multiverse, etc., they are generally discussing philosophical and abstract interpretations of really long-ass equations and theorems. What's being discussed above is NOT QM but rather PHILOSOPHY or at least the philosophy of the former. There is absolutely no harm in entertaining ourselves and engaging in thought-provoking discussions of philosophical nature, but I urge you not to mistake it for real QM. Real QM doesn't talk about things like ""what is consciousness and do our consciousness jump to a parallel universe when we faced with a life-death situation"", they Math things out in a fairly boring manner, unfortunately. Again, these conversations may be fun to partake in and may provide a highly abridged and rudimentary INTERPRETATION of what some aspects of QM are. That said, don't let me stop you from watching those videos or commenting yourself. Have fun!"

Your Rick Sanchez genius ass: ""Go ahead and ignore facts.""

Holy shit wow you've officially just won the argument. 

2. I've read the fucking article - you're not proving anything by quoting it again because I know what conditioning is and I've fucking studied it. Pavlovian conditioning IS classical conditioning.

3. Learn to differentiate facts and interpretation. Facts are raw data (ie. the results of the experiment). You thinking that the exact same principle applies to loli or shota hentai is an INTERPRETATION.

4. Amongst many other factors to consider, classical conditioning in the case of random objects and children are very fucking different. Seeing real life children paired with erotic activities is likely to induce cognitive dissonance and considerable discomfort in most people as most of us are socially predisposed to look down upon paedophilia, not motherfucking penny jars and other ""random objects"". You can't just say ""Men see gun and porn. Men horny when see gun. Ergo, if men see animated cartoon children and porn, men horny when see real life children"" because the two are fucking separate and to apply the same principle caveman-logic-style is fallacious in too many ways. Needless to say, not only does your argument fail to adhere to simple logic as real life children and animated cartoon children are different, you've also succeeded in cramping in MORE informal fallacies by not knowing horse shit about the science you're trying to use against me and consequently misinterpreting them. Go back to Psychology Today and do some more reading or something.

P.S. Nobody calls it ""Pavlovian Theory Conditioning"", most people either call it Pavlovian or Classical Conditioning. Just a tidbit for you to keep in mind next time you try to Ben Shapiro someone on Reddit so you don't make it seem as though you don't know jack shit about what you're saying and end up sounding like a kid trying to explain quantum mechanics after watching Rick And Morty. 

5. Sorry I forgot to take your sub-par literary capabilities into account and used high-school-level vocabulary. I didn't mean to be insensitive towards the mentally challenged. I use ""big words"" to make sure my message is conveyed accurately and to give people like you no room for misinterpretation. Clearly, you're far too stubborn to accept your own mistakes and refuse to employ logical reasoning into your arguments, so I suppose my efforts were wasted. That said, feel to leave one last irrelevant comment about how I'm a retard or something to make yourself feel good and give you a false sense of victory because I can't be bothered to correct someone who isn't willing to be corrected and realise their own errors and I'm not going to respond to you anymore. Have a good day/afternoom/night, snowflake."
Lolitary,f97thuk,t1_f96l5bw,1575170069.0,"Correction, you're the fucking retard. Do I really need to deconstruct and spoon feed where you're wrong? Slippery motherfucking slope fallacy, dumbass; ""If A then B, then C, then D. Ergo, if A, then D."" You proposed that masturbating to loli or shota hentai will lead to the person thinking ""it's just a cartoon, I'm not attracted to real life children"", which in turn leads to ""it's just porn, I'm not attracted to real life children"" and that you've ""seen this mentality develop"". Fun fact, personal anecdotes are the single weakest and worse premise to use in an argument. Do I need to explain that it's because it's highly prone to cognitive and observational errors and biases and that the sample size may not be representative and fair? 

Secondly, supposing that you really have ""observed this mentality develop"" and interpreted long term psychological changes accurately and correctly like the distinguished cognitive psychology Ph.D. graduate you are, claiming that a trend you see shared by a sample size in true for the entire population is a fallacy of hasty generalisation. Clear enough, wanker?

Your argument is literally on par in terms of soundness to the overblown ""video games cause violence"" bullshit because it contains the EXACT same fallacy, along with several others. ""Violent video games cause players to romanticise or idealise violence which in turns facilitates violent behaviours. Studies have found a potential correlation between the two."" Sound familiar? Correlation does not imply causation. If it isn't obvious enough, the research results were far from conclusive, though it did present an interesting to topic to explore in future studies. Not only did you fail to substantiate your argument by ingeniously citing a research paper on classical conditioning about fucking jars and guns which is, fun fact, a different ball game from paedophilia, the results merely indicated a possible correlation and as such does not constitute as conclusive evidence (even the bloody website disclosed it at the end, ""more research needs to be done""). TL;DR: you're doing what every smartass 14 years-old do when arguing online by Googling up research papers and psychology studies, skimming through them superficially and then saying ""hey look I found conclusive evidence to support my argument"". ""Research papers like that are fucking ubiquitous - if what you did is all that's needed to prove an argument, then just about every-fucking-thing is carcinogenic as there are countless papers showing albeit insignificant, some degree of correlation between cancer and substance from MSG to salt to sugar to permitted food conditioners. You know why doctors and professionals don't cite them? Because they're fucking inconclusive and do not meet the criteria of being good evidence.

Had you stopped being such a stubborn ignoramus and made an inductive argument as opposed to a deductive one, you would've totally been in the right; or at least not in the total wrong as inductive arguments are infalsifiable. You could've just said ""it MAY engender paedophilia tendencies and we ought to be wary"" instead of ""I've seen this shit happen it will happen"" and indirectly stating that shots and loli porn objectively facilitates real-life paedophilia."

2. You should read more carefully before jumping into conclusions. I did not imply that depression's a ""simple ailment"" which can be ""easily stabilised"". My core message was that there is a science behind mental illnesses and psychology, and that said illnesses ""can be stabilised to an extent"". For instance, a person suffering from a depressive disorder will severely lack serotonin due to reuptake at the neuron terminal. Antidepressants inhibit this reuptake, but that alone isn't always enough, which is why we have therapy.

3. Psychology may have have biological backing, but treatment for mental illnesess don't work the same way as with other strictly physiological illnesses like pneumonia or influenza. There isn't a determined list of steps to take that'll magically cure victims in a day or two; everybody is different and what's effective therapy is different for everybody.

anime,epdx7w3,t3_bumdqn,1559175737.0,"I beg to differ. I feel that JC's made multitudes of blunders in the production of the series. The overall pacing is utterly atrocious; it feels as though they were trying to force-fit as many panels as they possibly could into each episode, completely disregarding pacing and directing as a whole. There was little to no effort put within the animation either; the episodes have hitherto been nothing more than carbon copies of the manga panels. Lets not get into the SFX and that one time they fucked up 
Suiryu's nody proportions. It isn't the worse show in existence, but it certainly doesn't qualify as being decent in my book. Just my two cents, obviously."
