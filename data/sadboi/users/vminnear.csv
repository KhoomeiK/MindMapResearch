AskReddit,fquqyi0,t1_fqujp94,1589663234.0,"DnD is a table-top role-play game.

The Dungeon Master (DM) creates a world that works within the rules set out in the game guides, and creates and plays all the NPCs. 

Each player creates their own character that lives in that world, with a race, class and sub-class of their choosing. Character's stats are determined by a mixture of dice-rolls and the various features that the player chooses. 

During the game, the DM describes the environment as the players move through it, and players each describe their actions within the world. If necessary the DM can have them roll dice to check if they succeed or fail at a certain task, such as swinging a sword to hit a goblin or trying to pick a lock. The game can be more linear or open-world, depending on how the DM prefers to operate and what the players prefer to do. 

A large part of the appeal is it's an excuse to get together with your friends and work as a team, solve problems, fight bad guys, joke around and generally have a good time. It exercises the imagination - you're putting yourself in the mindset of your character and collectively creating a story of your choosing. You have the opportunity to be whoever you want in a world where anything can happen. And you don't have to pay money to do it, which is always nice."

I thought the podcast did a great job of toeing that line, especially when it shows us how Debra's mother forgave her son-in-law for murdering her daughter.. it's a commendable thing to do, but also strangely naive. How many times should you forgive someone before enough is enough? How much should you be willing to put up with?

I'm hoping the supermarkets make more delivery slots available soon, too, currently they are prioritising the elderly and vulnerable. In any case, they seem to be working hard to address the issue, so just need to have patience."
