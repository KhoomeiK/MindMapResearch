Short-term, ED seems to make us miserable in a way that is annoying but hard to break out of. Long-term, it can absorb so much of your time that you miss out on the things that bring joy and meaning into a life well-lived: open honest relationships, a worthwhile vocation, traveling this big beautiful world, etc. By some level, it's not what ED *does* that's always so damaging. It's what it prevents you from doing.

I was a SMART member and facilitator for years until this week (see my last post in the sub for that story...). That change has given me the opportunity to start a free-to-enter peer support meeting called ""Recovering Joy: peer support for a resilient recovery"" every Wednesday 8-10PM ET.

How is it like SMART? It's free-to-enter, not religiously affiliated, and won't tell you what to do or think.

How is it unlike SMART? We focus more on positive psychology and adding meaning/passion versus subtracting. We directly address concurrent issues with food. Also, we decided together that it's okay to mention other groups you belong to (as long as you don't tell someone else they ""should"" join one of these groups), and we review a journal article every week to talk about a new evidence-based self-help intervention for creating a positive life in recovery.
