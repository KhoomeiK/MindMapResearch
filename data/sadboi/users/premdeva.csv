Not me but; ended up being mine lol

I was into spirituality heavily, my family owned a haunted hotel with psychics and I was working there. 
This woke wook dude was REALLY into me and he was really sweet but I had a partner at the time. 

Well I was complaining on fb about having problems sleeping and meditating, so he messages me and says he has a deactivated iPhone that has meditation apps, binaural beats etc on it that I can have. 

Okay cool! He meets up with me at the hotel and starts showing me the different frequencies for different purposes in this app, totally thinking he's cool and teaching me something, as he's scrolling

The phone freezes. 

Stuck on the meditation to help with 



Impotence.

I ended up grabbing the phone and pretended not to notice, but I haven't seen him since.
