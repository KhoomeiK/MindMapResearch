Yeah, there's bs attached to the job, but I don't think any more than any other job. It's a more genuine environment than others in this field I think and the impact you make (in my opinion) can be far more significant. It all depends on the district, the students, the standards, sure. But in the end, you don't teach for the money, you do it because you love it.

It's just been really intense out there compared to other places. And it's like anyone I ever ran into was that way. I know they're the bad apples, but it seems to me as though a massive chunk of people out there are that way. Like the other guy said though ... it seems to (mostly) be out past the Islip area. To me, though, it's anywhere past Seaford, mostly starting in (my least favorite area) Farmingdale.

Nassau is not a bad place to live, though. I agree with that.. which is why I mentioned areas in Nassau in the first place.. but I'd say it's still not a place I'd recommend to anyone unless you're looking at specific areas, like the ones I mentioned.

Rockville Centre, Merrick, Mineola, Oceanside, Floral Park, Lindenhurst aren't bad areas though. You won't get as much space and ""pristine suburbia"" though. That said though, they have really nice neighborhoods. Just stay out of Suffolk. The culture in NYC is starkly different from that of LI. Lots of Italians in Oceanside though! Long Beach is one of my favorite place, lots of Italians, pretty diverse overall, and it's a big beach locale with a surfer-ish, boating culture.

If you're willing to shell out some decent money, Glen Cove, Hewlett, Manhassett, and Great Neck are pretty nice. More of an ""open"", liberal vibe but pretty snobby.

Here's my two cents. I constantly struggle with the same thing, I'd say most of us do, at least at some point. But what keeps me going is this lame little thought:

I may never be known for my music, my music will not make it into the ears of the vast majority of the people in the world, that is a fact. But I hope that someone out there can really gain something from it emotionally, to peek into this little world I made just for myself and, in that moment, to share with them. I think about the future and imagine young students, kids even, doing a research project that has them dive through the 400 or 600 year old internet archives, and I imagine them finding my audio files and feeling .. something .. something totally alien and primitive to them, yet familiar. Like finding a really compelling painting, or a really compelling ancient story. There's something special about encapsulating moments that will never happen as long as the universe exists, and that's what art is about, isn't it? Create a world within a world. That's all I strive for anymore. It's not for anyone, it's for me. And if at any point 1 person finds comfort or significance in it, even if for just 2 minutes, it's done its job. Hell even this lame post of mine will have the same destiny!

You have to live for yourself and make the world you want for yourself. If you're constantly looking for external approval or praise than you're wasting your time and your energy."

Personally, I agree. I've seen so many messy, crammed cv's/resumes trying to abide by this one page rule and it looks sloppy and is hard to read. I get that it's supposed to be a brief overview of a person's experience, but I find that keeping it within *two* pages makes more sense.

I'm assuming that most will disagree with me, but I find this to be a pointless staple in the professional world.

EDIT: I'm going to make some additions.

Knowing people in charge of hiring in other professional fields, they've mentioned nothing about keeping it short and to one page. Again, it limits information about all the relevant experience you may have.

Also, have you ever looked at a PhD student's or professor's cv? They're normally well over 4 pages long...

Again, I just think that the one page limit is like shooting yourself in the foot.

You need to learn how to keep it concise and minimize useless information and experience, but if you need 2 pages, use the 2 pages. As you gain more experience, if you need 3 , use 3."

AskMen,fmj4v7g,t3_fvct6j,1586123070.0,"I can't handle my partner being with other people. Polygamous relationships are increasing in popularity, and I won't say I'm necessarily against it, but I think it stems from a fear of commitment and devotion. Research shows that these couples are actually more open, comfortable, and supportive in the long-run, so there's definitely something there, but I wouldn't doubt that it's a minority of them. Most people would probably struggle emotionally with that sort of thing.

So no, I wouldn't do it. It's a gamble that's super dependent on a number of different factors, which vary from relationship, to relationship. All I can say is that my girlfriend right now is my best friend and I've never met anyone like her. Sure, I could probably go out there and get some more action, but to do that would (in my mind) be throwing away this special bond we've built with each other. That's a lot more sacred than sporadic excitement. It's like kindling a fire. It's not out of jealousy or lack of confidence, it's out of respect for the special thing we share, for our respect towards one another for always being there. It's like rock climbing on El Capitan - that's life - and it would be foolish to swap your most trustworthy carabiners for a new shiny one that's hollow inside and that would leave stranded on the side of the mountain or, worse, let you fall.

It's about **hedonism** versus **stoicism or seld-restraint**."

AskMen,fmbz7jx,t3_fu72a7,1585935928.0,"Girl I dated my junior year of high school. We hit it off, I guess I was attracted to her personality but she was also pretty cute. Things took off pretty quickly between the two of us, two weeks of action. Then I got sick of the way she smelled, I don't know why it was such a turnoff. It wasn't like she smelled bad, it was just this... particular.. smell. 3 weeks later it was over. She was cool though."

povertyfinance,flyuv27,t1_flybm29,1585609572.0,"oh my god every. single. time.

I recently got the biggest tax return I've ever gotten. I usually owe money, especially when I don't have enough. This time around, I was able to get enough to help payoff some loans. 2 weeks later my car has the window bashed in and my backpack with my laptop, all my classwork, research, etc. was stolen and I had to replace everything for about $1000. There goes a bunch of that.. Then coronavirus hits and now the leftover money needs to be saved for emergencies.. then I lose hours.. now I'm pulling money from that return to pay bills.. now I have $200.."
