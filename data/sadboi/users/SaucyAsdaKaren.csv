People that are in that state of mind are so far gone they have limited consideration for the way their actions would make others feel, even if they do, they have gone past caring. I dont agree that suicide itself is selfish, but i do feel that it is extremely unfair on any family members left behind that a person was allowed to get the point of taking their own life.

No one who wasnt aware of their own actions would react in such a way.
