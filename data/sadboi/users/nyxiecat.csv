It does have a distinct smell, but I don't come across it often enough to recognize it, and it might not be obvious in a lot of food anyway.

Burgers should be easy enough to find places without seeds on the buns, and at least it's obvious when they're there. But yeah, gotta keep your eyes open and ask questions.

I've been having a really really difficult time just to find a psychiatrist. They either don't take my insurance or they don't have room for new patients or, despite calling repeatedly, leaving messages, emails and voice mail, they just never get back to me.

And god I've spent so much time trying to learn to forgive myself for my broken brain, only for everything to be undone immediately by someone telling me I'm just not putting enough effort into whatever meaningless fucking task it is.

I'm hoping some day I get to try medication, just to see if it provides at least a little bit of help. But right now I can't. I can't even find a psychiatrist that will see me.

Just read ingredient lists and ask people, keep your allergy meds with you. Beware of chocolate desserts because people like to put nuts in them for no reason, but even then, ask before assuming.

Like, you want to do a bunch of things, you logically know you -can- do them, but somehow it just never happens? Or things have to be just right for you to be able to, or you need some kind of outside prompt that triggers the action?

Idk, it's just a thought, cause that's how it's been for me like, all my life. Of course you could also just be super depressed, that will definitely fuck up your ability to do stuff, find motivation, and things like memory and focus. But yeah honestly you should definitely see a therapist again, you shouldn't have to feel this way. The right therapist can be super helpful, and probably provide better advice than reddit. (I am of course a total hypocrite who does not see a therapist and instead struggles through every miserable day on my own. Don't be like me.) Could also be factors in your life that make you miserable that you just haven't realized yet.

It helps sooo much more when someone is willing to just listen to your tormented thoughts and feelings and then show that they understand, and that they love and accept you anyway.

And I think even for yourself, when trying to fight depression thoughts, it's better to approach yourself with compassion rather than trying to force the thoughts away. Cause like, the more you focus on something, whether in a good or bad way, the more it will get stuck in your mind. Plus, most of us are depressed for actual reasons, whatever those may be, so telling yourself that everything is fine when it clearly isn't is just gonna feel wrong.

So maybe instead it's better to talk to yourself the way you would to a friend, and be like, yeah I feel crappy right now and that is understandable, but maybe I'm an okay person anyway. I'm doing my best, and things won't be like this forever.

Idk, I'm not really trying to give advice, just rambling a bit. It's worked for me sometimes. I think this approach is closer to DBT and 'radical acceptance' than CBT, and I never liked CBT much. Always felt like it was too similar to 'just think positive' which just gets my hackles up.

Also yeah, I've had the same issue with a lot of people in my life. Currently my spouse who, while meaning well, just doesn't get it, and it's so frustrating. Like all attempts to explain in the world aren't working. You'd think if someone loves you they'd be able to just listen and take your word for what you experience and that what they're saying is the opposite of helpful, but nope. For some people it just doesn't get through."
depression,evdggl6,t3_cjcntr,1564437649.0,"I keep wondering this too. People never seem to get it when I try to explain how it feels, well, except a few select friends who struggle with the same thing. Otherwise people tend to go 'well we all lose motivation sometimes! do you think I wanna go to work every day?', and god, it's so frustrating. My lack of motivation is on a completely different level. It's like a black hole that sucks all meaning and reason out of every aspect of life.

But there are a couple of things I do that work, at least some of the time, because there's nothing that will work all the time. Sometimes all I can do is sit and wait out the worst depths of the depression until I start feeling slightly more alive again. 

So, there's caffeine. I won't solve any problems on its own, but sometimes it makes me restless and jittery enough that I can't sit still, and as a result I'll start going around doing things. Can be especially effective combined with music, and as a stimulant caffeine helps with the executive dysfunction of my ADHD.
There's eating something tasty and stimulating. Even when I'm super depressed I can usually enjoy sweets, and it may not be healthy, but sometimes it will give me enough feel-good brain chemicals to make me able to at least get something done.
Animals. Doesn't work for everyone, but I have pets, and being able to spend some time with a pet can really help. It produces good brain chemicals and reminds me why I stay alive. So I can take care of them, if nothing else.
Repetitive, fast-paced video games. Repetitive so it doesn't require much brain power to play them, but enough action to keep me going. I don't necessarily always enjoy it, but video games are full of positive reinforcements, and can sometimes trick your brain into feeling like it's accomplished something. Which can help me feel just better enough that I can move on to accomplishing other, real tasks.

So I don't know if any of this is useful for anyone else, but they are at least a couple of practical things that can be worth trying when thinking 'I should just be more disciplined!' doesn't work."
SwagBucks,eunf4nm,t1_euh6kqj,1563927988.0,"Yeah I agree. Like, it's not the people in-game stealing that's the actual problem, the real crime is what a shitty cash grab the whole game is. By making the gameplay frustrating like that they're just encouraging people to spend money on shields and upgrades.

Microtransactions are a damn plague. And most of the games end up just soulless carbon copies of each other, at least mobile games."
SwagBucks,eune35i,t1_eugc5nb,1563927608.0,"I never understood how it works and not sure I really care now, but thanks anyway. Also requires that find a guild that isn't crap. Meh. Almost done anyway."
SwagBucks,eud83qc,t3_cfwdlz,1563706680.0,"Seriously. I'm doing it right now, and it's almost exactly like World War Rising except somehow worse. I could tolerate a lot of the game mechanics, but the PvP is absolutely the worst. Dumbasses who keep attacking you for no reason. And everything takes foreverrrrr.

But yeah, I'm already doing it and should be able to finish soon, so might as well stick with it. And like someone else said, don't 'use' resources in your inventory until you're ready to spend them on upgrades and stuff, and try to grab all free gifts you can. I'm in an alliance and I've no idea how it's supposed to help, and I don't care enough to find out at this point.

But yeah, seriously not worth the 10 bucks you get for it."
SwagBucks,etg61f7,t1_etf1vgo,1562784508.0,"lol, yep, can't disagree with that"
SwagBucks,ete5acb,t3_cb8btz,1562723272.0,"I just did one of those, I don't actually mind them too much. But yeah like others have said, it's likely to see how you subconsciously react to certain brands and phrases. If it takes you a split second longer to hit the 'positive' arrow for a positive word following a brand name, that might be an indication that you don't really associate the brand with anything good.

Mostly it annoys me how the 'positive' key is the down arrow, and the 'negative' key is the up arrow. Feels backwards."
SwagBucks,erohzsf,t3_c303g7,1561079513.0,"I did the survey but didn't get credited, and for some reason support hasn't been answering my tickets today. They usually respond immediately but all I've gotten today is the auto replies that the tickets were received. Wonder why.."
SubredditDrama,ernu3l7,t1_ermvwl9,1561061107.0,"I always assumed it's some kinda... alpha male, leadership, strict hierarchy fantasy thing that they associate with wolves. Even if incorrectly.

But I suppose it could be all of those things."

learntodraw,eqycs1d,t1_eqwot2b,1560381192.0,"Yeah, I really feel this. I've been trying to treat it as a kind of self care, something that I need to do to preserve my sanity and lower my stress and anxiety. That way I can kinda justify it. Like, the more I feel mentally okay the more other, important stuff I can keep up with.

But it's not easy. It's not a 100% effective method."
FoodAllergies,eqq4gt9,t3_bz2szq,1560211914.0,"It depends, but usually I have to ask what's in the food anyway, cause a lot of the time it won't be obvious whether there's something in it that will kill me just by looking. If people are offended by me having allergies, well, that's their problem and not something I can fix for them.

Besides, if someone is close enough to me that I care about their feelings, they're going to need to know about my allergies sooner or later anyway."
secondlife,eqln3d9,t1_eql507c,1560147050.0,"lol, ngl that would be fun.

But yeah there isn't really anything quite like SL... You could try Sansar I guess, maybe SineSpace. I haven't done much more than taken a quick look at them, and mostly they seem kinda like SL but with fewer people and less freedom. But maybe there's more to them for someone willing to explore further."

SubredditDrama,eq99jv8,t1_eq94j7c,1559894828.0,"I don't follow the discourse all that closely, but yeah, being bisexual I also feel like there are similarities and I'm all for including them under the LGBTQ+ umbrella.

Still, I know I have seen accounts online of assaults where the asexuality supposedly to play some part, at least. Seemed to be stuff like, rejected dudes who were angry about being rejected, or abusive entitled partners and stuff like that, IIRC.

So idk, those aren't unique situations obviously, but there may still be a debate worth having there. Preferably by smarter people than me though, lol."

SwagBucks,eq8585d,t3_bxjuxu,1559858928.0,I had the same problem and was hoping I'd find an answer here. Thanks for sharing how you solved it!
SwagBucks,eq77n8t,t3_bxitsu,1559841930.0,About 200 sb per day I think. Depends how many surveys I get and how dedicated I feel.
SubredditDrama,epxovdw,t1_epvjcg9,1559606737.0,"They'll be fine even if you do it when they're older, as long as they get pain medication afterwards and the vet handles them correctly and all. It's not like they'll KNOW they're missing an organ when they wake up from anesthesia . I think they heal faster when they're younger though, so there's that."
SubredditDrama,epxn5lo,t1_epvqrqf,1559605347.0,"That's interesting. I don't think spaying and neutering should be AS necessary with dogs as with cats, because dogs are generally easier to contain. Even indoors-only cats are often good at escaping and can be hard to get back inside.

Still, even for large (especially female) dogs from what I've read it's more a question of WHEN to spay than IF. There's the risk of cancers, but also pyometras which can get really bad really fast."
SwagBucks,eprqn4c,t3_bvnln3,1559429433.0,"I agree and I also find it kinda hilarious. It's like my worst social nightmare. Successful, well-adjusted people staring at me, half laughing and half condescending pity, lol."
