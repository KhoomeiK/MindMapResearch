OMG, she’s married? Do I have to see her again? Why won’t she take my calls? I’m not sure how I feel about her. I slept with one woman who told me afterwards that she was gay and in a committed relationship. All guys SHOULD have these feelings. I’ll grant you that not all do. This is life. It’s complicated.

The Pacific Northwest? There could be a population there.  I’ve heard people talk about “psychic impressions” or “inter dimensional” beings, whatever the hell that means.
