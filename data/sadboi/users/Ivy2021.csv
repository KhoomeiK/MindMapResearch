socialanxiety,fcbbzgj,t3_egry6m,1577585007.0,"I have social anxiety disorder so I understand. It sounds difficult and stupid but it really does help if you expose yourself consistently to social situations, your anxiety slowly lessens every time over a period. When I isolate myself and then have to go somewhere with a lot of people, all of a sudden the anxiety hits me 10 times harder. Try to make it a part of your weekly routine to have regular social interactions, no matter how small."

I completely relate to this, I've been smiling and laughing and nodding along during Christmas dinners but really feeling empty inside. My parents get mad I don't do anything but I have no energy and I don't see the point. I feel as though none of my friends even care about me or how I'm doing, like if I stopped messaging them they would forget I exist. New Years is going to be another sad one waiting around for 12 alone and wishing it wasn't another year of this shit."
