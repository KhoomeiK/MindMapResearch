Yes,its partly our own fault we got scammed,people will be always clumsy,why not just eliminate the problem with just a better trade system? then it would be 100%.

I mean,i had learned my lesson,im pretty positive that i wont be scam anymore given that i took sometime to learn how they scam but we need to think about new player who already being flooded with learning the game mechanics they simply don't have time to learn how to detect a scam.

It's just my opinion tho,and im just dont understand why people are defending scammer instead of crushing them down completely. However even what had happened,im still having fun with this game and try to not care too much about scammer,as they exist in every F2P games."

Imo the 2 main problems are that new player like us don't know how to detect scam like this in the first place,nobody told us to learn about how scammer rob others thing off,there's just too many ways for them to scam,and the 2nd problem is current trading system is really bad,1 way to deal with scammer is to have 2 different trading system,Free trading and Fixed trading,trade from [poe.trade](https://poe.trade) should be fixed,meaning that whatever you are buying from that site,the seller have no control over what to give you and the system will do that automatically because the deal is already been done on [poe.trade](https://poe.trade) / or atleast their official trading site since [poe.trade](https://poe.trade) is kinda 3rd party site. And for free trading player still able to trade with friend.

I din't know they were so many sneaky way to scam until i watched a few videos on youtube.
