tifu,fnsuzbs,t3_g3hmo4,1587229300.0,"I missed the first part but had to comment at people saying they were afraid to touch their pets now.

Back in 2014 a stray kitten from an unfixed female in the neighborhood chose to stay on my porch. We gave him food, and made a small shelter as it was cold, and gave him a chance to leave. He did not.

I sat outside with him one day and he demanded all the cuddles and love. I knew he needed a good home and decided to take him in.

Cut to maybe a month later, I have developed a few spots of ringworm. Grandma has developed a few spots of ringworm. My cat with a compromised immune system has developed bleeding sores from ringworm. Only my oldest cat and the kitten were clear. Shit.

When I had first taken him to the vet, except for some strange fungal infection on his front paws that the doctor assumed was a mild yeast infection, his testing wad clean. (FiV would have meant he couldn't stay since one of my 2 cats was too susceptible) adorable little shit was a typhoid Mary.

Creams for grandma and myself, and diligence for my immunocomprimised ads who spread a new patch of the shit every time I scratched.

Pills for the cats. 2 dollars a pop. Half tabs for a month for kitten, 2 month supply for middle cat, 1 month supply for oldest (part cause to be safe, part cause she finally developed physical symptoms) vet visit for middle cat to officially diagnose, visit for oldest cause they wouldn't pill her without a visit as it had been over a year.

Coupled with FiV test, vaccinations, fixing and vet fees, I spent around 500 dollars taking that kitten in. That had been my PS4 savings :(

I would do it again in a heart beat. I just wish I wasn't such a piece of trash... due to a stunt my grandma pulled with the help of her shitty children, I ended up jobless and living with my mom for a short time, and that ended with losing him, as he made her cats stay marking in the house.

I had him for 2 blissful years, and then I failed him. I failed all my cats... I miss them so much... but at least with the girls I know where they are and that they're happy. Especially the middle fatty. She adores little old ladies. Grandma was mean to her about her adoration. New old lady loves her to bits. I miss my oldest and the little boy so much though it physically hurts...

But uh. Depression induced sads aside, I took him in and had a 500 dollar issue over it that involved ringworm and it was worth every penny and scratch. Shit happens. Don't hold it against fur babies. Give em love!"

Once when she noticed my new middle name she, firstly, said it was stupid, but then asked why I had to change it, too. Because unlike my first name there is no way to say it's masculine? I dunno.

She thinks I changed all of it as an insult to her. Yeah mom. I'm trans out of fucking spite. Has nothing to do with how much better I feel or how much so much of my life clicked into place when I finally figured it out. Allllll spite, yeah."

But if friend spoke about dysphoria, especially relating to genitalia, or taking hormones, her girl would get super angry and dismissive.

I knew it just wasn't gonna work. Girlfriend was hetero. Couldn't change that for my friend. But it's hard to argue with a person in love about who they love. Love truly is blind, especially when it comes to red flags.

At one point during a fight my friend flushed all her hormones after a fight and I was so upset for her.

I finally convinced her to have a discussion, to really sit and hash things out. They broke up. But now she's with someone who loves and accepts her for who she is, and they're super happy together.

OP, if it ends in separation, I'm sorry, I understand you've been together for a long time. But know that many out there will love you for you. And never feel like you can, ""change yourself"" or go back to pretending to be someone you aren't. Neither of you will benefit from that. Both of you will suffer and hurt, and it's not fair to either of you.
