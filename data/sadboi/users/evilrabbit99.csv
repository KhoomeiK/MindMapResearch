However, this is only a small part of the experience. The mental aspect is the real trip. Psychedelics put you in a very different headspace which can feel extremely spiritual/beatiful.

However, this headspace can be overwhelming. It feels like you entered a whole other world. Things can get confusing or you might get the feeling that something extremely bad is going to happen along with other delusions. This can cause a lot of anxiety and even panic attacks which can do lasting mental damage. 

Benzo's basically dim these feelings of anxiety and panic. When you use a benzo to trip kill you will calm down and the psychedlic headspace will feel a lot less intense than before. However, you will also lose that sense of spirituality.

It still feel feel unconfortable, your body will still feel very wierd and it almost feels like someone took advantage of you without your consent. It is hard to describe but it is quite a dirty feeling in my opinion. However the feeling isn't nearly as close as traumatising as a trackwreck trip, so I would highly recommend to get some benzos for your trip (unless you have an addictive personality, benzos can be quite addictive)"

Drugs,fg34lmg,t1_fg09b9h,1580470067.0,"Tbh whiney people like you are also not good for this sub. I actually enjoy reading those drug rating posts so speak for yourself. 

Besides I think having a lot of teenagers here is actually good because at least they learn some harm reduction. What is the point of a sub full of harm reduction tips if only the drug nerds browse this sub? They know that shit already, these stupid teenagers do not."
europe,fg346fz,t1_ffix093,1580469538.0,"Many overdose on laced drugs which exist because of the stupid laws. Besides there is a huge difference between drugs and I'd argue that there are many ""good"" drugs out there like mushrooms"

There is so much commercial bullshit out there espescially in EDM. I hate artists like David Guetta en Tiesto because they absolutely did not stay true to themselves but became sellouts to the mainstream. They pretty much let their original fanbase down in trade for fame and money.

I still remember when Axwell and Ingrosso teased the track 'Dreamer' and it was an amazing progressive house song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjmrBhg7Gus). You know, the genre that actually got them where they were and what their core fan based liked. Now when it got released the song was completely different to appeal to the main stream. Pretty much a huge fuck you to their fan base.

Make your own style. At least the people that listen to you will really love your music instead of being people that actually don't care about music but just listen to the latest pop garbage. If I were to become a famous produder I much rather have 10k followers and make something unique I love than have 100k followers and produce the most generic mass appealing shit there is."
AskReddit,ffj4h06,t1_ffixhdv,1579990158.0,Honestly a test kit is a must for pretty much any illegal drug besides weed and shrooms. Why would you ever trust a dealer with your fking life. Test kits are extremely cheap and testing is super easy. ALWAYS test your shit man.
