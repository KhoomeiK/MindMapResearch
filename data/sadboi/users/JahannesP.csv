I got order confirmation on January 28 and shipment confirmation in March 5. I had to pick one of the faster shipping methods because it was the only one available for my country but it took only 4 days from shipment to getting caught in my country's customs, which was extra 2 days until I actually got the package."

Initial activation isn't ""drag tip along the screen with no force at all"" levels, but it's a big upgrade over my last tablet. Pen tip is also much more sturdier than my last tablet, don't really know how it compares to other high end tablets. The tip just barely goes any down when I press it the hardest with my finger."

There is a little offset (1 millimetre at worst) when I tilt at the most extreme angle possible where it's still possible to press the tip on the screen. Other than that the cursor stays precisely under the tip. The stylus tilt function works like expected on Clip Studio Paint.

I am left handed and the support for left handed use is bad. Huion's answer is just making the entire display upside down, which means your main monitor will also become upside down."
