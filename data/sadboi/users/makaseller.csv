I struggled with bipolar and derealization disorder for like 10 years and then with anxiety disorder after I first got my job. Hopefully, I had my family and a true friend who always supported me. There were also people who said stuff like ""well, it is all in your head"". I know how it makes one feel. People just don't understand that it is an illness. I hope that you can find people supportive of you and soon get better. Cause I think that it is possible to feel good again. All the best wishes."
