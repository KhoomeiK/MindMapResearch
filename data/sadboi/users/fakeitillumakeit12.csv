Advice,fnsfhen,t1_fnscygq,1587220494.0,"Sounds fake to me. How do one get raped without making a noise? Hows that act of sexuality even possible if youre defending yourself. What about sueing? Everything seems wrong.

1- What does noise have to do with anything? It could have been an empty street or a deserted place. She could have screamed her lungs out and none of that would matter. She could have been under gun threat, or simply her ""flight or fight or freeze"" instincts kicked in and froze out of fear. 
2- i hope you're not serious about this one.. i mean how can someone kill you if you defend yourself? how can someone steal if you defend yourself? it's the same shit. You can defend yourself all you want, if the counter party is physically stronger and has a weapon, it will happen no matter how much you try. 
3- You need physical proof to sue someone for sexual assault. She probably doesnt know his name even, given the fact that it's a stranger. the process will take forever and eventually be dismissed due to lack of evidence. Not to mention that she barely has the strength to tell her family, do you expect in her mental state, she would he able to tell it to the police/lawyers/..? 

4- your level of naiveness is actually scary. you're blaming the victim and pointing accusations out of merely knowing the story.. i really hope none of the women in your life (daughter/mother/gf..) goes through this, bc i know for a fact you won't be a credible source of support."
