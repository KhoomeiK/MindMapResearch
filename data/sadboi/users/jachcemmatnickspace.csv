Since it is a phobia, it is irrational but this guy, crawling on my wall near the staircase which I needed to pass through was an unbeatable obstacle. I dont mind small spiders chilling in their webs. Although preferrably outside and on a different continent."

After a failed suicide attempt (ate 27mg of Xanax with wine), i woke up in a intensive care unit and then, later, in a psych ward. I was one of the fastest to recover and was let go after 3 weeks.

I live in Slovakia and hospitals are usually not in a very good state here. This hospital also wasn't anything remarkable but i would rate the stay 10/10. Almost like a vacation or a school trip.

Doctors and nurses are very caring. They check you everyday, so they can set up drugs better than a psychiatrist you see once a month. I went through 3 or 4 different medicine setups.

When something happens, everybody is there for you. Anxiety? Diazepam injection to the butt. Bored? Here is a cool activity for you! Wanna stay up late and watch TV? No problem.

I would also applaud the people. I was in the ""light"" category and most of the people had anxiety, panic attacks, depression, had suicide attempts or were experiencing a tough stage in their life. Everyone was so helpful. We talked, played cards, helped each other, it was amazing, made some bonds and even I was able to help someone which filled me with happiness.

Head doctor of the ward even let my family bring me a notebook in (phones and etc. are not allowed but people often smuggle it in during visit times) and work.

The only problem I had is that there were no therapy, but all the doctors and nurses were very skilled at this kind of talking and I didnt have a single bad experience.

Now I have a job, I am independent, money is steady.

Don't be afraid! It is not a prison, fuck the stigma. It WILL help you and I personally can say that it was one of the best working institutions in my country (and those are rare)."

You are just as human as everyone else, dont forget that. You deserve the same treatment as others and it is not your fault – as long as you fight it.

But I cant promise anything good for you, sorry... Episodes of terrible sadness, anger and total meltdown are probably awaiting and others will probably never feel the same. Find the right meds and therapy asap – but I am not able to do that even after a year and trying 10+ different meds. But love is fucking beautiful and everything will be intense. Best of luck."
