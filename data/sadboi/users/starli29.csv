Fate:
 I might lean on possibilities and random outcomes. If fate exists, fuck this world. Fate is another fantasy thing I might think of when I daydream, but I know it's not true.

Purpose of life:
Ooh this one is a big one. I think life is shitty because honestly the real purpose humans were created to live for is to survive, create children, and die. That's what many animals have come to be.

NintendoSwitch,fj912wy,t1_fiw39n0,1583128284.0,I played RF2-4 way before Stardew and I have to agree... It's Stardew but not Stardew *1000%
coolguides,fisvf2n,t3_eqxs03,1582694510.0,"I have a huge water bottle that, well, carries a shit ton of water. I noticed that if I laid the bottle sideways or had it on the outside perimeter of my bag, I felt unstable. I could literally feel the water sloshing around and making walking up 6 flights of stairs a pain in the ass.

Now I can carry a shit ton of stuff and still walk up with more. Not as extreme as training at all, but for my lazy ass it was pretty annoying to get a hang of."
announcements,fiq9xmy,t1_fiofqds,1582639264.0,"It's hard to explain why it's morally different, it just isn't the same. As you said, it's not the same but probably close enough that maybe you should keep an eye on it.

Most of the times, harmless fiction using those characters are out of admiration or creativity and doesn't quite border ""pedophile love"" and is more ""they're pretty/hot/etc""

I do get your point though."

mentalhealth,fhztky8,t3_erbb2h,1582011172.0,"I am extremely jealous of those I know who complain about treatment. There is one particular person I know who told me how they purposefully used their 504 plan to not turn anything in. She had a B for turning nothing in, meanwhile I received a D even though I struggled really hard. And I didn't want a 504 because I felt like others would see that I was treated differently.

It's a hell of a ride without proper help, but that's what I have for now. And I hope others out there will get the chance for it."
mentalhealth,fhzr9pj,t3_dijt4y,1582008473.0,Yes yes yes. I've had many friends that I've accidentally pushed away. I have this one friend that is always by my side. She doesn't even get hurt when I need space. She isn't the type to comfort me like a therapist or ask me about my day. She's always there and we laugh about the dumbest shit ever.
depression,fhzogah,t3_f5c12v,1582005595.0,"For me, it was more like a huge ass paper cut. Like the type that would hurt and you look for the cut and you don't see it till you look for where the pain is coming from. It makes me very angry whenever I realize that I don't know where it's coming from and why."
depression,fhzobj4,t3_f5kmc2,1582005471.0,Happy birthday! I love you!!!
depression,fhzo9et,t1_fhyxpu8,1582005416.0,"I read this story (a manga actually) that involves a boy who ended up committing suicide. This god makes him deal with the issues he has caused in other people he had known after he had died. Plus how much people had actually cared for him, even just a bit.

Yeah that made me feel guilty."
depression,fhzo2wd,t3_f5fyi1,1582005244.0,"Nope. Yeah. When I was asked by my doctor, I couldn't explain this. No I don't want to know how mangled my body is or how painful it is. Imagine falling asleep and staying nice and comfortable in a dream or staying in the sleep.

Just to not be here. At this moment. At this time. At the future. Not here anymore. But I try to this of it as ""if I can last past this, I'll be fine"""
depression,fhznv9n,t3_exo6f1,1582005045.0,"Really trying to get a therapist/psychiatrist. Kind of procrastinating on calling my insurance card if the clinic my doctor recommended could be paid for. Honestly kind of trying my best to not accidentally push anyone away. Lack of sleep makes me extremely moody. Honestly the occasional episodes I get really makes me pray that I don't end up giving up.

Anyone out there struggling, I hope you can also sleep ok at least for tonight."
AskReddit,fhawmm5,t1_fh6f1j1,1581429067.0,No lies here. Passed out like a baby after even though I slept at 3 am. Good shit.
elsword,fdkqfop,t3_elpq2y,1578509004.0,Made me shit myself more than it should've. I wish I could gold.
movies,fd6310v,t1_f4z5tv7,1578184852.0,Right. I caught that and I just laughed at it.
movies,fd62b99,t1_f5mmco0,1578184575.0,"Just my own take on this conversation, but I don't think the other person said anything about brown people. 

Though I do agree that because they're oppressed the fey are less civilized, but I do feel like they have a point about Maleficent being the only special fey. Kinda wacky but in the end it's just a few minor details."
