ADHD,fr2srvp,t3_gm2r6y,1589843184.0,"I had never thought about it that way. That makes so much sense.

You mentioned that some people lack the concept of time, but I have an annoyingly accurate internal clock. It's usually correct to within 15-30 minutes. But I'm also not always paying attention to it, and it's still very easy for me to lose hours to something because I'm hyperfocusing.

I don't know about anyone else, but I have to actually distract myself from the desire to fall asleep in order to fall asleep. Sometimes sleep meditation helps with that, but I have to be doing *something* or I don't get sleepy. Just laying there doesn't do it.

But yeah, typical, widely accepted sleep advice and recommended ""sleep hygiene"" is pure trash for me. I was an insomniac when I was a toddler. It is hardwired in me. Long before constant access to screens was a thing. I have struggled with this for 40 years. The only thing that reliably sets my sleep cycle to a socially normal window is medication. It's so irritating when people try to give me advice about this."

I thought maybe it was because of the focus on older movies (she's 10 years younger than me), but she doesn't like RiffTrax either. 

She's never really been able to articulate exactly why MST3K doesn't do it for her. My best guess is that she just prefers to make the humor her own, rather than relying on someone else to feed it to her who is getting paid for it, when it comes to ironically enjoying things."

One time a driver had an order that wouldn't scan on his phone when he dropped it off. When he called support his English was so poor that he couldn't explain what the issue was, so I did it for him and made sure he was squared up so his delivery was recorded on time.

Every once in a while a driver has a car problem and I don't get my stuff at all. I have to call customer service and get a refund and get it reordered and wait a few more hours for my cat litter and ice cream.

But, uh. That's life? No one's perfect. People make mistakes, even when they're getting paid. God knows I do. I've actually only had like two legit bad drivers in over a year of weekly deliveries. I'm really sorry that you guys are having to deal with such shitty people right now.

I used to go to the Hallmark store and laugh out loud at the sentiments in the Mom cards because they were so far away from the mothering experience I had. 

I actually don't have a single memory of anything I ever did for her for Mother's Day. I can guarantee you that I tried to make her happy, because that's the kind of kid that I was.

When I got older and do have some memories of it, only now that I'm describing it do I realize how absolutely bizarre it was. My dad would pick out the card and all of us kids would sign it. We didn't do individual cards, and there was a reason for that, but I don't remember why. (Other than that obviously in retrospect my dad wanted to control the message we sent to my mom on Mother's Day.) He was also the one who gave her the card, so we only got acknowledged after the fact. If there were gifts he picked them out, too, but I honestly can't remember if there were or not.

She wanted to sleep in, she wanted my dad to take her out for breakfast or lunch or dinner or whatever. Our job was basically just to do our best impression of not existing and not needing her for anything.

And then when I was an adult, I was NC with my parents until I was about 22. Once we started talking again, there were several years I tried to give her gifts, but she was always so indifferent to them, or clearly unimpressed by them, that I gave up. Sometimes she didn't even answer the phone on Mother's Day, because it's still all about my dad catering to her and making her feel special. So I don't call anymore either, because she clearly does not desire a call from me. She never mentioned it when I didn't call, and she never seemed enthusiastic when I did. And now we're NC again and I really couldn't care less anymore.

We also never discussed this. So I've never heard her convoluted logic about what she thinks Mother's Day is supposed to be about if she doesn't want her children involved in it at all. Although I suspect that my youngest sister, the GC, is involved in it, gives gifts that are appreciated and/or makes calls that are answered.

I dunno. I guess to me Mother's Day was supposed be not just about your mom feeling special, but about getting to celebrate how special she is with her. And apparently my dad was the only person allowed to make her feel special.

In conclusion, Mother's Day sucks, and so does my mom. Cheers."

I would vote for a baked turd on the sidewalk before I would vote for Trump, but Biden has the best chance of actually winning against him. Because young voters love to talk on the internet, but they don't actually go out and vote. Which is why we are here now.

Most of the people that work there are great, but every once in a while I'll get a dude who thinks that I must have no clue what I'm trying to accomplish. You know, the ones that answer ""where is X?"" with ""Well, what are you trying to do?"" They're usually much younger than me.

The last company I worked at issued cell phones and laptops to many of its employees and they were absolutely shocked, *shocked,* I tell you, when they found out that all their personal pictures and videos and everything else were going to be scanned by software that was intended to find copyright violations (i.e., pirated movies and music). These people also had 30 days notice to remove their personal stuff off the devices, and they still didn't do it. And btw you would not believe the amount of porn they found when they did that sweep.

Do not ever use a company device for your personal business or entertainment unless you're totally okay with your employer seeing every detail. If you value your privacy, do not *ever* agree to use your personal device for your job. They will install shit that lets them wipe your phone, all your contacts, all your photos. If they demand that you have mobile access, you demand that you get a device from them.

raisedbynarcissists,fp0yjnc,t3_gajo4e,1588219865.0,"Oh yes. I used to get myself into trouble a lot for asking actual questions. Asking for any kind of clarification. Like, for example, if I loaded the dishwasher and put something on the bottom rack that they thought belonged on the top rack and got in trouble when one of them unloaded it, I would ask why, trying to understand what rule set to use to do things ""their way."" Back in those days I was naive enough to assume there was some kind of logic to the things that would make them super angry, and if I could get more information about what that was I could avoid doing the things that made them mad. Silly me!

And also, this was like playing Russian roulette, because sometimes they would actually give me an answer, but then sometimes they would fly off the handle and become furious with me for asking."

politics,fozfuzq,t3_ga9jpd,1588189958.0,"I just want to point out that this isn't just a Republican or conservative side issue.

I had to ask for my father for help for a couple of months several years back because I was laid off and unemployment took several weeks to kick in. (And if you're curious why I didn't have any money saved up for exactly this kind of situation, it was because my entire emergency fund had recently been depleted by medical expenses.) At the time, I was paying $1100 a month for rent. A little more than average, but actually a good deal for the part of town I was living in at the time.

He told me that the only way he would help me is if I found a new place, and he thought that $500 a month should be my target rent price. Average rent in Houston at the time was about $950. 

My own father, who currently pays something like $8,000 in rent in a very fancy place, and before that lived in a $2 million home, thought that I should be able to live comfortably in a place that cost $500 a month in a city where the average rent is almost twice that.

I'm not a snob. I don't need a fancy place. But I do require a place that I'm reasonably certain isn't going to get broken into and where I'm not going to get mugged or worse in the parking lot.

So not only did he want me to rearrange my life in order to accept his financial help, which was very temporary, he also seemed to think that I should somehow be punished for being in a difficult financial situation I had not created.

Don't even get me started on what he thought the rest of my bills were ""supposed"" to add up to.

My parents are deep blue liberals, but apparently when you become some level of wealthy you either forget or stop understanding what things are important and necessary for other people to live a not-miserable and functional life. And you stop having empathy for people who can't make ends meet. I have absolutely no idea where he got the notions he had, but they were disappointingly and appallingly out of touch."

raisedbynarcissists,fovktwr,t3_g9i0zt,1588103013.0,"Yup. When I was in my late twenties a close friend and I went to stay with my parents for two weeks on vacation. We stayed with them because I figured I was safe if she was there. I didn't do anything to prepare her because I knew my parents were going to be warm, kind, generous, etc with her there.

We got to the day before we left and then something happened that caused them to show their true colors. My parents are masters of being deeply cruel and shitty while coming across as being perfectly reasonable. Sometimes even I don't realize they're doing it until afterwards.

It took my friend weeks after the trip to wrap her head around what had happened because the cognitive dissonance was so strong. She kept saying that they must have had a reason for acting the way they did. Nope! That's just how they are."
TrollXChromosomes,foveoju,t1_fov90ky,1588100054.0,"I'm not the person you replied to but I can speak to the other side of this:

I like kids just fine. I'm good with them. I talk about parenting with my friends frequently, and I don't feel like I'm ""left out"" of anything socially because I don't have kids. (Which was never really an issue for me, but definitely is for some women.)

I think it's maybe kind of good to kind of step back and reevaluate every few years on this issue, especially if you're not sure. I know I did, not because there was some part of me wanting them but because there wasn't, and I was kind of worried that I was maybe in denial or something? But I have always ended up confirming that no, I do not want them myself.

I'm in my 40s and there is absolutely no question in my mind that I made the right choice in not having them. I don't feel like I'm missing anything without children and I don't have any regrets."

ADHD,fosjtum,t3_g93akk,1588032114.0,"I once had an interview with a guy who was a real weirdo and he told me that I needed to pass a test in Excel as part of the interview. Which, fine, I'm an expert in Excel, I teach other people how to use Excel. I had used Excel daily for 20 years at that point. 

Dude did not tell me until I sat down at the computer that it was on a Mac. I'm not a Mac user.

That really wouldn't have been a problem. It might have taken me about 3 minutes to figure out how to navigate through it on a Mac ... but it works the same.

Except this guy decided to stand behind me, without explanation, the entire time, so I couldn't even take that 2-3 minutes to figure it out before I started. I don't even like people I know standing behind me when I work, so for a strange man, who I was alone with in an office by the way, to be doing it, was really not okay. 

Unsurprisingly I did not get the job.

And also, I show people how to do various things on computers as part of my job. There's definitely a big difference between inviting somebody to watch what you're doing and somebody standing behind you looking at what you're doing without telling you."
