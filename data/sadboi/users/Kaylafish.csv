Things got better, as you said, and we had our new normal. I thought about him all the time still, it just didnt hurt like it once did. That is how I have been for a long time now. Until this morning. I saw a video of someone's cat being loopy and having a hard time walking. It reminded me of my last day with my boy. He had been sedated because of his condition (he was very close to a urinary blockage, which ultimately did arise and kill him), so he was very loopy. He kept trying to get places, and I felt bad hovering and moving him constantly. So, I let him try on his own for a while. I feel guilty though, for letting him struggle to walk. I should have scooped him up and laid him down with me sooner. That wave of guilt hit me and I cried for him for the first time in a long while. 
Losing them is horrible, and it is never quite the same. You aren't alone, this is the right place to come. I hope the good memories of you and your kiddo will help carry you through the tough times."

Second, people like the idea of ""Murica"" and ""I do what I want"" which means putting others at risk so they can maintain their lifestyle, even among a crisis (that for some reason, some people still think it's fake?). Third, not everyone has good health insurance or PTO, which leads to people going to work even while sick, spreading disease more. 
I think this is something we shouldn't need, to your point, but that I think we do- until people can stop putting themselves first and doing what is being recommended by experts. 
That said, I do realize it will suck for a lot of people and punish a lot of those who were already doing what was necessary. However, I think when it comes to something this unprecedented, we don't have a lot of choice.

TNR does work, it just takes time. It also needs to be accompanied by education of pet owners.

In all these cases, people are the problem. People need to do the work to fix it, not kill animals for being who they were made to be. 
Just because we can mass kill, doesnt mean we should. We should search for the solution with the least amount of suffering and cruelty. Shooting, poisoning, or whatever other methods of extermination are not humane nor compassionate. I get they are problematic in some areas, but that should not mean a death order.

To kill these cats for simply being what humans made them to be and doing what nature dictates for them, is cruel. We are the reason feral cats exist. They should not pay the price for our lack of responsibility. TNR and educating pet owners should be our goal. 
TNR allows them to live out their lives without continuing to populate. Simply killing them does not fix the fact that they are very prolific breeders. They will keep making more cats. Eventually, with TNR, the population will decrease and those they prey upon will increase in numbers. This is about a long term solution, not a ""quick fix"". Additionally, through this process we are able to compassionately let go those who are suffering, and rehome those who are friendly. The unfriendly ones will remember being trapped and stay away from humans, hopefully increasing their chances of survival and not being killed by people like you.

Compassion is the sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings and misfortune of others. Personally, I do not believe you can uphold that definition and send a cow to slaughter, or send a feral cat off to its death without definitive proof of suffering that could be eased. It's just a lack of caring about their individual needs and circumstances. 
That is not empathy talking, you are anthropomorphizing. Animals do not know the difference between being sent to a clinic for a sterilization versus an abdominal surgery for a foreign body.

aww,f76deen,t1_f75y564,1573426700.0,"Simply exterminating them isnt going to solve this. Cats are insanely good at reproduction. If you can stop the reproduction, their territorially will keep others from moving into the area and continuing the cycle."
aww,f76cyhl,t1_f75n73b,1573426560.0,"Taking them off the street and killing them doesnt accomplish that. Then the ones that have yet to be killed, still reproduce. Cats are very quick at repopulation. They are also territorial. Fixing them allows them to keep others out of the area, without growing the existing population. At least one way we aren't exterminating someone for simply having the misfortune of being born an outdoor cat. 
That said, I hate people who allow their cats to roam, fixed and unfixed."

I had a third who just passed away, and he did look black until he was in the sun, then you could see he had a nice chocolate color. It is interesting how their coats all develop so differently!"

blackcats,f5ali8y,t3_dnclnk,1572109681.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. My 5 year old boy left us last month due to complications from a urinary blockage. He was gone within 26 hours. We had him from when he could fit in one hand, bottle fed him, etc. We never thought we would be saying goodbye so soon. 

It is horrible losing them, especially when there is nothing we can do. But, the thing we do know is that we loved them and that they knew kindness. I try to remember that when I get sad, thinking about how much I miss him. 

I hope you can find comfort in knowing she knew a loving home and was treated like the princess she was. I hope you can find peace."
Petloss,f50nocr,t3_dmdhpf,1571930161.0,"I lost my little boy last month. I saw the signs of urinary blockage and I took him in immediately. Even then, it wasnt enough. No matter how they leave us, there are always a lot of what-ifs. But the one thing we can all hold on to and know for sure, is that our babies were loved. I think that is a powerful thing. 

I am so glad your little girl knew love and kindness and and lived a full life with you. She was a lucky girl. I hope you begin to find peace and soon can look onto your time together with a smile."
Petloss,f38zczt,t3_dfy8l3,1570741802.0,"I have felt some guilt over the same thing. It has been a month since I lost my cat, whom I was very close to. I have two others, who I love very much, but it has been hard to bond with them lately. I do still have a lot of laughs with them when we play, but it definitely isnt the same. I keep going through the motions, playing, feeding, etc. I think it is helping. 

You aren't alone. It is a weird and heartbreaking transition to go through. I wish you the best."
Petloss,f34p7e2,t3_dfjkyy,1570657519.0,"I am so, so sorry for your losses. I lost my special needs cat suddenly a month ago, also due to medical complications. It all went so fast, it is hard to catch your breath. 

Though I still cry over him and I think of him daily, I have found comfort in watching videos of him and seeing photos. I think about our 5 years together, from when he could fit into my hand, until I held him as he passed. It breaks my heart, but it also comforts me to know he was loved that whole time. He was my world. 

I hope you will be able to find peace in your memories together and knowing they were very, very loved. They were very fortunate to have you."
Petloss,f33e28y,t3_decm6f,1570636859.0,"Thank you for giving him such a kind and loving home. I lost my 5 year old boy a month ago and it is devastating. They are such special souls, so pure, so innocent. My heart goes out to you all and I hope that you can find some peace. 
Even now I find it hard to see his things, to go about my routine without him doing his. His other cat siblings still expect him sometimes and it breaks my hear to see that. One day though, we will all be more at peace, though our pain will never truly fade."
Petloss,f33dj51,t3_deoxko,1570636575.0,"I am so, so sorry. Losing our companions is rough, losing them young is even tougher. I lost my 5 year old boy a month ago due to a medical issue, no amount of money could have guaranteed his life either. He was fading fast, so we had to say goodbye unexpectedly. I am so, so sorry you had to go through that too."
Petloss,f33b46t,t3_dfcvvf,1570635250.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. I just lost my little boy a month ago. He was with us since he could fit in the palm of my hand. We did everything with him. We took him on car rides, to visit family, on vacation, everywhere. He was /is our little boy. We taught him how to eat solid food, drink water, use the litter box, play, etc. He also had some health issues that continued to develop as he got older. We took him to all kinds of vet specialists, put him on medication to keep him uncomfortable, bought air filters for his asthma, feliway to stress, you name it. We put our hearts and souls into his sweet little self. He was our whole world. At the young age of 5, he got a urinary blockage and he was gone within a day. I have two other cats at home who I live dearly, but it just isnt the same without him. I would do so much to get him back. 

Anyway, a long way of saying, I know a bit of how you feel. No one really understands just how much they influence our lives, how much we depend on them and bond and live them. To have it all ripped away so quickly is devastating at the least. 

You try to go about your normal routine, only to be painfully reminded over and over that nothing is the same. They aren't there when you wake up, going to sleep, or anywhere in between. Where they once filled the day with feeding, medicine, playtime etc, there is nothing. 

I hope you know that while we dont know you and Salem personally, we do understand this horrible journey you are on. You aren't alone and we are so sorry to be sharing this heartache with you."
Petloss,f0nsc9l,t1_f0n6kzd,1568779113.0,"Thank you for this comment. I know I'm not the OP, but I just lost my little boy almost a week ago and I am devastated. It helps a little to remember that other people know what I am going through. Not that I want anyone to feel like this, or to have to lose a baby like this, but just knowing others are on the same kind of journey, gives me hope for the future."

I find it hard to explain to people just how much he meant to me and just how horrible it feels to be going through life without him now. 
I am so sorry you have had to do it so many times, and so close together. I sincerely hope things get better with your piggies and that you can finally have a chance to start healing."
