It sounds like they have been creating vacuums of power along their path. Just cuz they dethroned some rich dude doesn’t mean the next guy who takes over the region is going to be good. 


The kid who idolized them realizes after experience the atrocities of a more ruthless leader that they left his village vulnerable. He overthrows the leader and some how comes back into their life now at the head of a generation of hardened warriors who have spent their lives fighting evil that came to their land because of the opportunity the band created by overthrowing the local power. he feels the  need to hunt them down/punish them  because they are just leaving people with broken power structures where ruthless agents take over a squash the people.

Wattson either forgot her guns or didn’t have em. 


The fight with G was risky when you dropped down. They wasted a clip spin shooting. You could have used the  Roof angle for cover but hey you got her so.

I liked the charging battery  behind cover next to the death box cuz you could hear bloodhound coming. Picking up the armor would have been the real smart move since it is full and quick.

If he had a full rez that might have turned out different."

Here us why I think  it did work.

I think he was already outside so it wasn’t a flank maneuver where he left his team to do it. If you notice in the beginning of the video his team is just barely signaling that people are there. Then bloodhound uses tactical. If he hadn’t already been outside of the tunnel that would have been really dumb to run all the way around.

His grenade disrupts vision so him continuing to move was critical to not getting pinned down behind with a 3v1.  I think overall his continued movement is why it worked.

Coming from behind also worked because he got that first guy down quick. He had clear shots and didn’t miss it.  Nor did he try to duck behind cover he just pushed through. Not letting the enemy really lock down where he was. That adds to the confusion of the gas and direction of bullets. 


Moving to his teams side gave him options he could have healed up. He chose to push back into the fray and finish the caustic.

- Edit: I think the quality for me in this sub is in the comments. Even tho people post their glory clips I read different opinions and hear about ideas of what should/could have happened. 

This sub is where I learned that I should be using combinations of guns that play off each other’s strengths. How to use cover. When to look down sights. I wasnt even using light ammo guns before I joined this sub cuz I felt like I never had success with them. Little did I know..."
apexuniversity,fpoydaq,t1_fpo7gw8,1588792780.0,This is where communication is key. If your team knows you are flanking the. They don’t push too hard and use grenades to keep distance a bit. Then you all go in at the same time. When you are out of sync that is what you said happens.
apexuniversity,fpoxm84,t1_fpkmwtk,1588792410.0,"I have to say that I started off doing just that and it works great. I also found this that having 2 in reserve allows me to create a line of gas to stop enemies from escaping/pushing. I’ll drop at the rate of recharge for 1 canister without enemies known in the area. Once I know we got baddies nearby (at least hearing shots). 

Too often I fortify a building to move into another one  while looting and have only one canister able to go when we get ambushed."

apexuniversity,fpe1fw6,t1_fpdhtgp,1588538456.0,"I decided after a couple games as Crypto to put my EMP on a hair trigger.  Here is my reason why.

Surprise is the biggest reason my drone doesn’t get shot. Most decent teams can shoot my drones pretty quickly in an open space if they don’t have enemies pressing on them. 

Hitting them early even if they can recharge before we can engage them gives my team time to position. Those extra 2 actions of using a syringe, all getting to the roof grabbing a quick grenade, all happen because a team isn’t quickly coming in after getting their shields knocked down half way. 

Teams spread when they see a drone because they know it hits in a circle.  If I hit all of em more likely I hit the one of em that hasn’t been gathering batteries. 

Waiting to use the ult til the perfect moment is always subjective. I never know for sure when another party is going to appear and the longer I am in my drone the more likely I am or my team is gonna ambushed from a team where my drone isn’t. 

I find it much more effective to just ult when I see a group, park my drone and then move with my team to a better position (200m is not too far) than it is to try to fly my drone again after the fight begins. It only does 50 damage to shields. 1 shot to someone’s head and I do more with my gun. I cant shoot if I am flying my drone waiting for the “right moment.” 

The emp is not strong enough to warrant a lot of focus.  One clip of most guns does 4x+ damage. Flying in my drone takes away my ability to  really add to my teams damage output."
