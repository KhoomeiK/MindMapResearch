Whatever proprioceptive ""sense"" of what looks good in synchrony with music that most people have just isn't there for me. And my friends have poked fun at me/girls have lost interest in me after sensing my awkwardness so many times that I now have somewhat of a phobia of dancing... or even of being in a place where I'll be in some way expected to dance, for that matter. I also know it's not just social anxiety causing this because I couldn't do it even with my last girlfriend, whom I was very relaxed around.

I've also tried to just embrace my inability to dance and make a joke out of it, but that was when I learned that there's a difference between humourously awkward and cringy, lol. So fuck it, you'll find me at home now."

russian,fqbu4iz,t1_fqbhi9p,1589243958.0,">That's interesting, I never would've guessed that the paucity of neuter words was so drastic that it would lead to *significantly* weaker recognition and faster semantic satiation for native speakers. But that's why I needed people like yourself to answer this kind of question, that's not the type of intuition that can be taught in a class. I think I can speak for a good amount of learners to say that endings in о, а, я, е, ё all simply sound like singular nouns."
russian,fqbcu57,t1_fqb5q5m,1589234647.0,"I understand the argument for the ambiguity of the original form and the lack of the root in any derived terms. *But,* why does this not also apply to feminine and masculine loanwords, which similarly lack a true Russian root? How is ""-"", ""a"", or ""я"" (most of the time) seen as a discernable suffix on which declined forms can be built, but not ""e"" or ""о""? It seems to me (a learner) that by the logic you presented, either *all* loanwords should be left indeclined or none should, with said exception of final ""у"", ""ю"", etc. By the same token, I see why an erstwhile-novel loanword might have been frozen in its full form back when it was first getting incorporated into the Russian language and then kept in that indeclined form by literary presctiptivism. But again, how would the incorrect ""нет кина"" have been any more ambiguous than ""нет шоколада"" back when these words were true foreign borrowings? Either could be interpreted as M or N genitive forms. You provided that the models for dealing with neuter nouns are more tenuous than those for M or F, but to me, they all seem equally regular (with the only exception being the 12 neuter nouns ending in ""-я""). Tl;dr it still seems like the neuter gender was, to some extent, arbitrarily singled out as a closed class.

Aside from these few points though, I do appreciate your thoughtful response."
linguistics,foxbtld,t1_foxb7m3,1588139342.0,"Perfect, thank you. Are there any sub-categories within elipses? Because there do seem to be a variety of possible ellipses with different parts of speech as their antecendents, especially across languages."
linguistics,fox0ogh,t1_fov8p2d,1588131300.0,"Please explain. I've never heard the term ""inflection class"" in anything I've read on the subject of Russian, nor have I in the time I've spent learning the declensions found that there were over 100 variants of anything. In fact, I find the nouns quite regular, and the irregularities manageable. This is largely because the nouns with stress shifts, irregular plurals, and degenerate cases tend to be the more commonly-used nouns.

As for what you said about the responses being impressionistic at best: I agree, but for all intents and purposes of this thread that's okay. I was just hoping we could bring some obstacle that we've faced in language learning or study to the table, maybe learning a thing or two in the process."

BPD,ff0dn25,t3_eqrdtd,1579467927.0,"Yes, with everything, I agree. The most painful part for me is knowing -in every new romantic dynamic that I have going- that it's only a matter of time until the inevitable happens and they decide they don't want to be around me anymore. That is, when they realize what I'm really like and that all the confidence and laid-back ways they associated with me previously were just part of a front. Happens *every* time with girls whom I'm genuinely interested in, and I seem to be incapable of behaving any other way. The fear of being left is insurmountable.

It also doesn't help that I'm a guy, so this behavior seems even *less* becoming of me. (I just feel like worrying and being emotional is generally lent more clemency in women, I don't mean that to offend anyone)"

I didn't mention kratom because I 1) didn't want to get anyone who didn't know about it hooked like I got and 2) didn't know if you guys would be familiar with it. Kratom isn't as bad, but I'm still physically dependent on it. However, I'm definitely for its being legal, leaning on *it* instead is better than potentially OD-ing on heroin."
linguistics,feandi1,t3_eo3ut9,1578950544.0,"What sound in a language you've studied has posed the most difficulty for you to pronounce?

The sound could be a consonant or vowel. In Russian, I've noticed that I have a great deal of difficulty pronouncing ы in isolation. I can get it pretty close, but when I hear native speakers pronounce it, it's markedly more tense and undiphthongized. In Pirahã, I find the /t͡ʙ̥/ sound to be outright unpronouncable, not once have I been able to pronounce it in a way I feel is correct. It's a bizarre, almost unnatural coarticulation to me. Similarly hard to pronounce is the voiceless uvular trill, /ʀ̥/. It's so close to the fricative version that I'm not able to distinguish them well, and if I can ever pronounce it, it seems to be more by luck than anything."

My goal is to just exercise strong self control and text less, it's just not me to avoid it altogether. I think doing it right and swallowing my need for reassurance is within the realm of possibility, I just need to find a way to get there and stay there.

Anyone who texts ME too much without my initiating it, I ironically find incredibly unattractive. I am attracted almost exclusively to girls who are independently happy and content and not looking for someone to lean on like I am."

Yeah, not everyone is going to be compatible with me and rejection is something we must all grin and bear at certain points, I agree. But when their interest in me is fizzling out at the exact same stage every time, that can't be mere coincidence. Plus what seem like justifiable things to say in the moment are obviously uncalled for and, well, cringey once some time has passed and I can view the situation with some objectivity. Not to mention the feedback I get from my friends the few times I've given them even a watered-down rehash of what I did.

I will give thought records a try, they actually sound promising. I have to ask though, do you ever struggle with trusting your own opinion when reading your prior thoughts?"
