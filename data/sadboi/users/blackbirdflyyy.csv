Just because you have interests in something doesn't mean you would necessarily enjoy a job in that field in the long run. My suggestion would be to just try to get experience in different types of jobs and see which parts you like. What makes you feel fulfilled in a job?  Do you like working 9-5, M-F or do you like shift work? Do you like working at a desk or on your feet? Do you like interacting with people a lot? Do you like working from home?

You don't have to know everything you're going to do now. Just figure out the next thing you want to try. It's really a process of getting to know yourself better and learning. Adults at any age are often still going through this.

One other piece of advice I want to give that took me a while to figure out: pick things that you enjoy the process of doing. Not the things that you like the idea of, that sound cool. If you want to be an Olympic figure skater, do you enjoy and find fulfillment in practicing skating hours upon hours every day? Or do you think it would be cool to just be an Olympic figure skater? The thing that will keep you going is enjoying the process, and the day-to-day."
HealthAnxiety,fo6pb8e,t3_fj9h57,1587564067.0,"One thing that has helped me, is learning that shortness of breath is a later symptom of Covid-19. You don't just start with it. It's a result of the pneumonia. You're going to have things like cough and likely fever way before shortness of breath shows up if you do actually develop it from the disease. So if you don't have a any other symptoms of pneumonia like cough, the shortness of breath is not caused by Covid-19."

One book I've found incredibly useful is The Courage to Heal: A Guide for Women Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis. Even though it's technically geared to women, I think it's useful regardless of gender. It's like a big reference guide that reviews all the ways childhood sexual assault touches your life and helps you understand and process your experiences. It includes stories from others as well, and some instructions for therapeutic activities. 

One free online resource I can think of is Mood Gym. It's like an online self-help workbook for depression and anxiety. It's not PTSD-specific, but I found it helpful with some of the anxiety-related aspects of PTSD. It uses principles from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to help you adjust your thinking patterns to more healthy, productive ones.

However, then they did exclude the people deemed non-compliant (and gave no measure as to how they did this), they said the masks were 80% efficacious, but gave no indication of what their measures were or whether these were statistically significant. They also made no mention of how this compared to the control group. Additionally, there's an obvious confounding variable with the study including people with different illnesses that have different methods of transmission. We would need a breakdown of who had what to see if this impacted the outcome.

After removing over half the people from each experimental group, that's fewer than 100 experimental subjects, which is quite small. Even if you could draw conclusions from this study, it's done on people wearing masks in their homes to prevent their children from infecting them - where they are in close quarters for long periods of time, and this is not generalizable to wearing masks in public."

While yes, it is an added barrier, the only way it would help is if an infected person were to cough or sneeze directly on your face. And even then, your eyes are not protected, and are an entry point for the virus. In a health care setting, masks are generally used with eye protection for droplet precautions, as workers are often performing procedures that put them at higher risk of exposure, requiring this level of protection. This is unlikely to be a problem if you're going about your day and can avoid people coughing on your face.

The biggest things you can do are to wash your hands and avoid touching your face. It is very common for diseases spread by droplet to be passed on via contaminated surfaces.

I appreciate your sourcing! Here's a good resource for people on the use of masks, and tips for prevention:

When you go for biomedical sciences, what you major and minor in specifically don't really matter much when it comes to finding work. Most related jobs I've seen would just look for someone with a bachelor of science, with a focus on health. Experience matters way more than titles. Choose what you're most interested in for your major and minor.

I did a biomedical sciences undergrad (in Canada). I majored in Health & Disease and minored in psychology. A lot of people I went to school with originally wanted to apply to med school. When we eventually got to that point though, a lot of people changed their minds and were interested in other things. I found that in high school you don't know about very many jobs, so you try to pick from what you know. You'll eventually get exposure to more types of work.

I completed my undergrad and then did a 2-year nursing degree to get my RN. I worked briefly in front-line nursing, and then made the move to health informatics, which I'm really excited about. 

There are a lot of directions you could go with biomedical sciences. There's going on to become a registered health care professional (e.g., Social Worker, Doctor, Nurse, Dietician, Speech Language Pathologist, etc.), working in research, health care administration, health policy, quality improvement, health tech, etc. 

And if you don't like your program after your first year in school, it's pretty easy to switch. Focus on getting good grades for now to help get you into the school and program you want. I hope this helps!"
