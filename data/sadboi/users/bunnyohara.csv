The situation doesn't make any sense, period. No matter what he's doing, it's not going to be good, he's lying about what he's doing. Whether he's cheating or not, he lied about being on a trip for two days to you. What if there had been an emergency in those two days? I don't mean to sound harsh, I think you're just heavily in denial.

Agoraphobia,evwkd3v,t3_clnbui,1564866324.0,"Hello! I've been on Klonopin since 2012-ish, and it has helped me tremendously with day to day anxiety! Absolutely no side effects - definitely very sensitive to medication and share the same pill phobia!

1. Absolutely. It does not make me feel loopy or sedated whatsoever. You can always start with half the recommended dose and see how that works for you, that's what I did at first. 
2. Never experienced ANY side effects, even after it wears off. You're more likely to experience that with shorter acting benzos like Valium & Xanax - with those two I did experience rebound anxiety, but not the case with Klonopin. It's been extremely good to me and I've only had to increase the dose slightly after all these years. 

Good luck, always feel free to PM me if you'd like to chat!"
Agoraphobia,ev9v24y,t3_cimg0x,1564331975.0,"My BIGGEST problem, by far!! It took me 10+ years to realize that my experience with such severe derealization stemmed from childhood sexual abuse and the disassociation I used to protect myself when I was little. My therapist and I realized that is likely why we have never been able to use CBT on it, like we have my other panic sensations. I started EMDR therapy to help with my trauma. 

I am housebound. But when the panic hits, everything starts looking different, time feels off, none of my surroundings make sense. It feels like I don't know where I am or what's happening, realistically I do, but it FEELS as though I do not. It is, to me, by far the scariest and most intense panic sensation I experience."

BPD,esjw36g,t3_c80zzz,1562043547.0,"I understand. 10000%! So my relationship is going on 7 years now, for a long time I would have what could only really be described as temper tantrums when I felt insecure probably once or twice a month. I still feel icky when I think about how everyone is better in every sense and he must realize that too, though I've gotten a lot of these feelings under control in the last year or so. Starting couples counseling to help me with my jealousy issues and to help with our communication in general has definitely helped, having him do DBT work with me has helped as well. It also helped when he stopped giving in to my fits. I was receiving something from them, I'm guessing attention, feeling wanted, feeling needed, but something clicked eventually and I realized how draining they were on us. He decided he was going to be more social and I'd have to get over it. I really felt like I despised him (extreme black & white thinking!), I couldn't understand how he could be doing this to me and wanted badly to end our relationship. Him being more forceful about reasonable social outings was like exposure therapy in a way? It made me gradually feel more and more trust for him. That combined with joint and individual therapy has really helped. With enough time, pressure, the right partner, it's possible to manage these feelings. 

I also just want to say I think it's great you can realize this before even getting into a relationship. I would really use DBT techniques (workbooks on Amazon are pretty affordable) now to see if you can alter your thinking habits."

It's like there's a switch that gets flipped and suddenly the person that I love, admire, trust no longer exists, it's all coming from within me and I know this, but something just takes over. It's indescribably frustrating for me and I feel terrible that he has to deal with what are essentially temper tantrums. However! We started therapy a couple months ago and I really do think it's helping. We also do DBT worksheets every couple of days. We're 7 years in and I've gotten so much better. If you haven't tried counseling with her, try it! Would also look into DBT workbooks on Amazon. It really helps break thought patterns. 

He's traveling out of the country alone in a few weeks. Me 3 years ago would have been a wreck. Me today am happy for him, there's a little bit of anxiety but it's really manageable."

If he's waiting for you to relapse to leave, I would seriously consider starting the decoupling process now. I would see a couples therapist, not to save the relationship but to help you start the process of leaving. They help greatly during these transitions, especially if someone is high risk. A long term relationship ending is a huge trigger for relapsing,  unfortunately."
