That was my personal interpretation.  I really loved how you incorporated modern technology into your imagery and it flowed so well-the one small thing I would change is the rhythm of the first stanza, but otherwise this is extremely fantastic"
poetry_critics,fnrlozl,t3_g3f67f,1587192985.0,"I really liked this poem- the repetition, themes, and imagery are fantastic.  While this may be a personal preference, something about the line last line of the second stanza( the one with deaths as the last word) feels a little bit off- who’s deaths do you mean?

Not “can I have your phone, I need to search something and my phone is a crappy flip phone” -  instead it was just “give me your phone”. “Ask your brother if he likes me” “ text your mom to ask if I can come over”.  That was one of the more insidious things about the abusive relationship.  I didn’t realize why her requests left such a bitter taste in my mouth until I realized how much of my consent she was leaving out of them.  It was humiliating, honestly"

There’s nothing wrong with being in love.  You don’t have to hate yourself for not cutting your best friend out of your life-  that sounds like a huge deal, and from what I read you really need that friendship in your life right now.  I don’t really have much advice to offer about meeting new people or trying to find love with somebody else- I wish I did.  But I want to tel you that there’s nothing wrong with you and there never has been.

If you don’t have that friend group, then follow the advice of people on here and try to insert yourself in social situations like clubs, or activities.  The other thing is that you’re probably going to experience several failures before you’re successful(this the friend group I talked about earlier.). I totally understand how it can be harder to date as a not so good looking guy, and you might run into a lot of obstacles.  Also, make sure you try to boost your own self esteem/self confidence.( I know that’s pretty generic advice, but it’s true)If somebody doesn’t see past your looks, fuck them- they’re not worth it anyway.  Try to remind yourself that you are human, you deserve dignity, and that people who make fun of you are simply wrong.  Lastly, you seem like a really nice person, but remember not to fake kindness towards somebody.  If you feel like you have to always act nice around somebody, then they’re personality probably doesn’t fit yours anyway.
