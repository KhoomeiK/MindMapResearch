They picked on me and avoided everyone else but every time I tried to defend myself I just couldn't. They drove around like lunatics pulling up manholes and flooding my poor little town. Next thing a I know drones are delivering drugs, to me. Why me? I honestly don't know ha. All I know is I woke up, completely disoriented and punched the headboard of the bed.

No way, under any circumstances should he have been let go. If anyone making these decisions cared enough about what Arsenal are, they wouldn't have let it happen.

Yes, he wanted to be paid similarly to Ozil. We, as a club could afford it and should have made it happen, simple. We've lost Jack, Theo, Santi, Alexis, Koscielny, Monreal and more over the last few years. Ramsey had his injury problems but when he played he influenced everyone else. He worked his ass off. He wanted to win because he was Arsenal. He should be our captain realistically. He's what the picture of Arsenal should be, classy, no controversy, humble.

Try. Every single day. It gets better and someday you will see the struggle was worth it.
