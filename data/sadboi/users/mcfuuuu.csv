Maybe suggest that to help with her boredom. No one really enjoys cleaning as much as I do, but, there's just something really satisfying about cleaning up. Maybe that will help with the boredom, and keep her busy so you can work?

My husband (we're in our 30s) has been working from home since March. Has it messed with my routine? Yes. Am I unable to clean and blast music? Yes. Am I bored to death? Oh yes.  Do I have change my plans to accommodate impromptu meetings? Yes. Do I like this bs? Not one bit.  However, I am doing best to make sure I'm quiet, not disturbing his work, and accommodating to his needs, especially when it's time for meetings.


It's a respect issue, if she can't respect your work and appreciate the sudden changes you made to accommodate her, then I do agree with others that you need to reevaluate your relationship. This kind of behavior gets worse, wayyyy before it gets better. If she's not willing to work on things to be better for you and your relationship, then this will continue to be toxic to your work and general well-being.

They actually track all of our off Facebook activity for ads, if you opt out of that you will start seeing less ads that are not relevant. However, Facebook continually adds whatever they want to your ad preferences based on likes, shares, and comments. Clearing these categories out something I do about once a month and I end up deleting a lot of stuff. Not so much now that we can opt out of tracking off Facebook activity.

science,fnp377s,t1_fnoq5tc,1587138427.0,"Idk about how they make money, but what I do know is how to take control over the ads you see. You can't completely remove ads, but you can make sure the ads are relevant to your interests. It's work, but worth it:

You can hide ads you don't wanna see so there's more room for those you DO want to see. At least on Facebook there is a way to hide/block ads from a specific company by **tapping the 3 dots or arrow** next to the post. 

There's also **ad preferences** in the settings you can change by deleting the random things Facebook adds to your list of preferences. There's gonna be a lot! They literally add random words like sock, doll, or sweatpants. That's a few random as hell things I seen in my preferences that don't belong. If you delete them periodically you will see less and less of ads you don't want to see. But, Facebook continually adds categories based on comments, likes, and shares. So, it's something you gotta do regularly or you will get more and more bs that doesn't relate to you.   


As of recently we've been given the option to opt of out **off Facebook activity**, this feature helps A LOT. Turning this off prevents them from tracking all your activity elsewhere and finding more ads that target you and your browsing.

I ordered some pet supplies (added 1 for new cat to sub and save collar order) around 11 am, was told 4/28, it's already changed to arriving Tuesday. They might be a priority, x 3 Seresto flea collars at $50 each.

Edit: fixed typo, added words."

I was so pissed bc it's 420 all month and I wanna make butter before 4/20.  It magically arrived on 4/6. Sooo, I think they're overestimating shipping on non priority items to make it look like they're delivering faster."
