lonely,fp8vqp1,t1_fp8vdcs,1588404659.0,"Since I've started my new job I work nights so days when I'm off I can't sleep at night so I have alot of time to my self to just think. Thats what I'm hoping, that we aren't alone"
lonely,fp8v9r0,t1_fp8utjg,1588404174.0,"Yea, I thought that this quarantine would be easy because I'm an introvert. But its been rough. I've thought of just going out in nature to relax and kind of just center myself"
lonely,fp8br8x,t1_fp8bcqn,1588388381.0,"I feel that. Whenever I'm around other people I always wonder ""do these people actually hate me and just not tell me"", or ""maybe if I just don't talk maybe they'll like me more"". It always just feels like I'm a burden to others. I cut out so many toxic people from my life thinking it would help, but then realized they were the only people I really knew or hung out with. Then I just became more lonely."
lonely,fp8as8o,t1_fp89sb6,1588387720.0,"They are totally overrated. Whenever I think about hanging out with them, I just get anxious and then when I do hang out with them I just think the whole time like, man I should have just stayed home"
lonely,fp6y7i2,t1_fp6vn26,1588360668.0,"Yea man, I've had to tell people we are no longer ""friends"" because they never contributed to the relationship and they get all offended like i did something wrong. Like you I also only have like two real friends"
depression,fp6i09l,t3_gb5r8l,1588352678.0,"I've done that, if they can't even respond trying to help you out. You don't need them, only the realist of real friends will help out"
depression,fp6h9by,t3_gaymww,1588352311.0,"I was bullied from 6th grade up until about my senior year in high school. I can only remember bits and pieces of those years but they are very blurry. Then not long after I graduated, I was diagnosed with cancer. I beat it, but I don't remember anything during that time aswell. I was extremely depressed and not in a good head space. And tbh besides the scars from my surgeries, it doesn't even feel like I had cancer. I can hardly remember doing any of my treatments or anything"
depression,fp6elz3,t3_g9ndgw,1588351012.0,"I feel that. I haven't felt alive in years. I died on the inside when I moved from my home town 10 years ago. And I thought when I moved back about a year ago. That I would start feeling better again, but honestly it made it worst. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Nothing ever makes me happy, I can't ever seem to enjoy anything. My social skills are subpar and not getting better, so it's hard to make friends. Let alone get a girlfriend. Everything feels pointless, like whatever I do it doesn't matter. I just... I just don't know what to do anymore"
DestinyTheGame,fg2fxbl,t1_fg2fcjv,1580444245.0,"Yea, that could be. I only tried it the once and it didnt work I  just did it legitimately. But maybe next time I'll try it again"
DestinyTheGame,fg1da4h,t1_fg00mev,1580425080.0,"I'm pretty sure they patched that awhile back. Because one of the last times I went in to that raid, I tried doing that. And when his shield went back up. They launched off of him"
DestinyTheGame,fg1cc8q,t1_ffzvze8,1580424611.0,"The exact reason why I hate doing lfgs, if someone is being toxic or is insisting or demanding we do it his way and it's my group. I kick him quicker than you can say good bye. Lol"
DestinyTheGame,fg1c2gn,t1_ffzx534,1580424485.0,"I did it on my tenth run, but tbh. That raid is stupid easy"
DestinyTheGame,fg1buha,t1_ffzwsm9,1580424366.0,"When I'm looking for a group on lfg, I usually usually put ""x raid fresh, kwtd 5+ clears"" because with at least five clears you should be very comfortable with what to do and should know all the different jobs or at least know a specific job for each encounter really well. And I literally never actually check to see if they have 5+ clears because injsut assume they do if they dont already have the emblem or whatever"
