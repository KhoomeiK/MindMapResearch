By age 20 I had taken 2 years off after high school to hone my art skills in order to go to college to train in becoming a concept artist and industrial designer. I had been getting pretty damn good to, I reckon if I kept at it id probably be a professional now. On top of that I was in the best shape I ever was, working out everyday, eating right and had a huge social circle of great friends. 

One week before my 20th birthday my mother dies abruptly after spending almost 3 months in the ICU for an absurd amount of damage from drug abuse. This absolutely destroys my passion for art and I just couldn't pick up the pencil anymore, I haven't touched a sketchbook ever since. So I get a job at a start up company working as a kind of community advisor, I deal with clients and make calls on behalf of the owners, basic stuff. They let me go after 3 months because business is slow. So still majorly depressed I kind of just sit around for another 7 months until I enroll in school for general science classes at my local college. I never took any academic subjects in high school because I wasn't encouraged to do so. About year into that I abruptly had to get a major surgery that left me in recovery for a month and had to drop my last semester, I just needed 2 more classes than I could apply to university. But these 2 classes were only offered first term meaning I had to wait until the next summer to take them, another year. All this is happening while my friends are moving on with there lives and I'm trying hard just to get moving on from high school. Eventually I recover and get my courses under my belt and apply to university. I get accepted into my desired school for my desired course, it was my biggest achievement.

Two weeks into class and I get swamped with major anxiety and depression. I wasn't doing good before this but I think the stress of it all put me over the edge. I had to drop out the semester because I couldn't get out of bed. Over the last 2 years (I'm 23 now) I had lost most of my friends, stopped working out to focus on school and gained a ton of weight. I had been depressed for a while but it kind of just caught up to me. That summer I took a road trip to Florida, it was absolutely the only thing I had to look forward to in 3 years. On the way back I had a psychotic break from reality and completely lost touch I barely made it home before I completely lost my mind and had to be dragged out of my house, beaten by police and locked in a flouresent room for 4 days before they'd let me go. 

This was 1 week after my 24th birthday. So here I am still living at home with my dad a 24 year old man with less than 2 years work experience, no education, no friends, no girlfriend(never had one) and basically just a broken shell of a human. I'm trying to learn to code on the side thinking about maybe going back to college for programming but at this moment having to start over for a third time I honestly don't know if I want to do it. I just don't have it in me. I spend 70% of my day smoking weed and laying in bed until It gets late enough that I can down some sleeping pills and alcohol and sleep for 11 hours. I there hasn't been a night in months that I haven't cried myself to sleep before passing out. I honestly pray to God that I don't wake up, I don't want to anymore. 

Maybe I could fix my life. But I've been hit with so many curve balls and my life has been stunted so much I just don't think it's worth it.

I'll be 30 by the time I finish a bachelor's, that's even if I do. I'll be 35 by the time I have my first relationship, that's even if I ever do. I'll be 30 by the time I have my first real job, that's even if I ever do. There really isn't a point. I'll be pitied, lonely and unremarkable for the rest of my life and there's nothing I can do. The only thing I want now is to die with some dignity but I'm not even allowed to do that. I wish I was never born. I have nothing to offer anyone."
