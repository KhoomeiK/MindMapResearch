todayilearned,f7oy6un,t1_f7nubmx,1573937334.0,"I think the issue is you're taking it really, really far over there. No one is suggesting that they're creating their own language, or at least I'm not.

I don't mean to imply that this dog was like ""outside + water = beach, EUREKA!"", but more like... ""it's fun 'outside' in the giant bowl of 'water'"". Like, you say it's natural instincts for a dog to put together how to get out of whatever it's trapped in, why wouldn't it be natural that they realize there's a big thing of water outside and that they like it?

I firmly believe that they are much more intelligent than we understand. I believed that before I had my Kelpie, and now that I have him I have no doubt in my mind that we are not giving them enough credit. Not all dogs obviously (I have a Lab that's made of love and drool and nothing else, lol), but still. Like you already believe that they can think ""I'm stuck, how do I get out?"" Why can't they think ""I like huge water. That's outside. I want outside""? 

I wish you could spend a day with my Kelpie. It was definitely 100% intentional.

I think if we stopped measuring purely with ""human beliefs"", we'd get much further. By that I mean that just because we as humans can't comprehend it, or don't yet comprehend it, doesn't mean it's impossible or even improbable. It's one thing to try to understand what's around us using the tools we have, but our limitations do not dictate what nature can and can't be."

This idea that humans are the only ones who can think and learn is so ignorant."
todayilearned,f7nbimn,t1_f7n1mz8,1573893857.0,"I dunno man, have you ever owned a seriously highly intelligent dog? I have a 5 month old Kelpie/Aussie mix (read: escape artist) that keeps getting out of our fenced and reinforced yard, so we've resorted to keeping him on a lead til we can get the ""electric"" fence up.

I came out to bring them in one day and there were a bunch of leaves all around the stake in the ground. I poked around in it and saw that this puppy had figured out that the thing he was attached to was attached to this thing that's in the ground, so if he dug it out, he'd be free too. Then he buried his handiwork.

I don't see it as too farfetched to imagine a dog who's been trained to communicate this way over x amount of years to put existing ideas together on their own. This dog probably realized that ""beach"" brought him ""outside"" where there's ""water"". Not really that hard..."

todayilearned,es8qgt0,t1_es7ay18,1561709210.0,"I drive an SUV to and from work. I'm not gonna get my husband and dog and whatever else I'm apparently supposed to always have in my car at all times, and have them sit and wait for me to get off work cuz I'm not supposed to have an empty SUV. 

My husband drives a big pickup that he'll use for gigs and, especially in the summer, hauls trailers full of audio equipment to various towns hours away from where we live. 

Should we buy a third car so he doesn't drive his pickup around town when he needs to go to the store while I'm at work?

But how can I be at work if my husband is never supposed to be alone in his pickup? How is he supposed to go to the store while I'm at work if he's supposed to stay in my car to make sure it's never empty? 

There are people all over the world who only eat once every couple days, don't have a roof over their heads, or very many articles of clothing and they manage. Why aren't you living on the street when it's so much cheaper to not have rent or electric or internet to pay for? How naive to think people would want to save hundreds of dollars a month...

I'm sure you'll pull the apples and oranges card but do you realize how retarded that all sounds? Probably not since you went ahead and made the comment anyway."
