dpdr,fqxq6h6,t1_fq5agk9,1589736179.0,"That is very good to know. I did mean it more like a waiting room, not in the context that I now know it is used in the DID/OSDD community. I definitely see how that is confusing! I‚Äôm not as well versed in DID since this is the one major dissociative disorder I do not personally have experience with. I plan on updating a lot of the labels on this after reading the comments."
dpdr,fq5idq9,t1_fq4vski,1589106581.0,What is it that you don‚Äôt agree with about it? I‚Äôm honestly just curious because I‚Äôd like to get other people‚Äôs perspective.
Depersonalization,fq56cs9,t1_fq55qfo,1589093963.0,"I guess my idea of it is that the ‚Äúreality‚Äù we normally live in is the tangible, visible world and the ‚Äúexternal reality‚Äù is like another layer of reality or alternate plane of existence. Sounds kind of crazy, I know, but I feel like with my experiences with dpdr it feels like I‚Äôm seeing a deeper level of reality. Like I‚Äôve stepped into another dimension and that actually seems more real than the ‚Äúreal‚Äù world everyone else is in..... but that part is really open to interpretation I guess. More of just an idea than anything based on current science."
dpdr,fq45vc8,t1_fq37ft6,1589073973.0,"Thanks! I actually did do some illustrations of schizophrenia (and a few other related disorders) based on this concept, I just want to do more research before posting anything since I don‚Äôt have first-hand experience with schizophrenia. Thank you for the suggestion to look into ipseity disturbance. I actually had not heard this term before so I‚Äôm going to do some reading now!"
Depersonalization,fq2ulqf,t1_fq2u1ru,1589059887.0,"Omg my OCD started around 8 too!! And that‚Äôs when everything kind of fell apart for me. I definitely think there is a strong link between dpdr and ocd. Yes, please message me!"
Depersonalization,fq2nt9x,t1_fq2mbjd,1589057924.0,"That‚Äôs awesome! I would love to see what you have if you want to share. I am very visual and think about philosophical things metaphorically a lot. I‚Äôve had dpdr as long as I can remember too. My memory really only goes back to around 5 years old but my mom said she remembers me having ‚Äúcatatonic‚Äù episodes as early as 3. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through a rough time. These days I rarely have it, but it does still creep up on me when I‚Äôm going through something particularly stressful or if I‚Äôm at a really low point. I hope it gets better for you soon!!"
Depersonalization,fq2l7a0,t1_fq2k26s,1589057222.0,"Thanks! And yes, I agree, I could do depersonalization and derealization separate. I have experienced both but the derealization is more frequent and intense with me. They‚Äôre similar but also very different. I‚Äôm going to work on conceptualizing them separately! Thank you for the input!"
Depersonalization,fq2jroi,t1_fq2gycv,1589056805.0,"That‚Äôs how it feels for me too, if I‚Äôm understanding you correctly. I guess that‚Äôs what I was trying to illustrate with the barrier between ‚Äúexternal reality‚Äù (which I feel like is an outer layer of reality, a zoomed out view of the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù) and ‚Äúreality‚Äù as a normal brain perceives it. With DPDR I feel like the sense of self is still tethered to the actual self somehow but it feels like it‚Äôs in a separate plane of existence. I think we‚Äôre talking about the same thing? My sketch just might not communicate that part of it very well."
depression,foist0h,t1_fohebj0,1587795857.0,"Same here! My appendix ruptured, I had complications (which were ignored by the hospital staff until it got really bad), had an emergency response team come in because I was in septic shock, I also developed ARDS (the same thing that kills people with COVID-19) and was basically put in a medically induced coma and was on a ventilator for 4 and a half days.

When I woke up, my memory was wiped, either from dissociative amnesia or from the extremely powerful drugs they had me on. I had no idea where I was, how long I had been there, why I was there, nothing. The last thing I could remember was crawling to open the door in my apartment while I was on the phone with 911. I was around 8 weeks pregnant when I went in to the hospital and when I came off the ventilator I asked if the baby was ok. I had to be told I had a miscarriage because my body was shutting down, even though I was apparently conscious when it happened and in a lot of pain. I found out my entire extended family drove across the state and had been staying at the hospital, people that I thought probably gave zero shits about me were all emotional telling me how scary it was to almost lose me, everyone at my work helped my boyfriend move us into our new apartment, people at work donated money and gave me a $1500 check to cover bills or whatever I wanted to spend it on, pretty much everything I had been stressing about had been taken care of and all I could just relax. It‚Äôs truly how amazing how kind people are to people when they think they‚Äôre going to die. 

When I came off the ventilator, I felt like shit, could barely walk, still had to be on oxygen, was on a feeding tube, had a catheter, all kinds of tubes coming out of me, was constantly being monitored and I really couldn‚Äôt do much on my own. In recovery, I had hallucinations, night sweats, fever, abdominal pain, it really sucked. Even with ALL of the shit I went through, I STILL often wish I could do it again just to get a break, and maybe partly to just have people love me without conditions. It was so nice being taken care of and not have to meet anyone‚Äôs expectations. I think back to how everyone was so caring and supportive and I didn‚Äôt have to try to even put on a happy face or go through the motions because I was sick and no one expected me to act any certain way. I feel extremely guilty for wishing to go back to that sometimes because of all the pain it caused my family, my boyfriend, my lost baby and me, but sometimes it seems like that is the only way to get a break and for people to actually accept that you really need it. People with depression just need a to have time to reset sometimes and I think it‚Äôs normal for us to just daydream about any way that could possibly happen."
dpdr,foftesb,t3_g6qrml,1587742498.0,"It would typically last 15 minutes to a few hours when I would have the attack like episodes. I very rarely have those anymore unless I‚Äôm going through something in my life that‚Äôs causing extreme stress or grief. Now, I will sometimes get longer periods of DPDR but they are more of a vague generalized detachment than a sudden separation from reality.

For me, it was more terrifying having it as a kid because I had no clue what was happening and had no education on mental disorders whatsoever. None of the adults trying to help me seem to understand what was going on or how to help me either, which is really scary when you‚Äôre a kid and think adults know everything. I thought I was dying and I think my parents did too sometimes. It was the 90‚Äôs when it all started for me and there wasn‚Äôt much knowledge of DPDR disorder (it was still just depersonalization disorder then) at that time. There are still a ton of mental health professionals today that don‚Äôt know what it is today. It was really hard going through it alone, but I think because I was so young and my brain was still developing so much, I was able to learn coping skills and figure out how to control it a little.

Anyway, I hope you are able to figure out what works for you! It sounds like you‚Äôve learned some ways to handle it already. Be patient and just don‚Äôt lean in to it too much. It took over 10 years for me to get a good handle on it, but now I rarely have to deal with it. So hang in there!"
dpdr,foeh648,t3_g6qrml,1587703669.0,"This is how I feel during my episodes of DPDR. It started when I was very little, I remember periods of feeling like I was in a dream world and everything was fake when I was as young as 5 years old. It became more frequent and intense and I had my first full on ‚Äúattack‚Äù when I was 9. I thought I was dying and crossing over to the afterlife or something. It was the most bizarre and terrifying experience of my life up to that point. I taught myself grounding techniques before I even knew that was a thing. I would try to find a place away from people and just sit and stare at my feet. I would just focus on how my feet were real and the ground was real and try to push out any other thoughts. It wasn‚Äôt an immediate fix but it sometimes helped me slowly pull myself back. Then after a while I would just suddenly snap back to reality. How long does the dissociation last for you?"
dpdr,focu0kr,t1_fockxiv,1587675862.0,For real.... it feels like my DPDR experiences are a portal into an outer layer of existence where all of the stuff he‚Äôs talking about makes sense. But then I get sucked back into ‚Äúreality‚Äù and realize it was all just a lapse in sanity...... right?!?? üòï
AvPD,fo9gdse,t3_g67ueq,1587618779.0,"Yes. It makes me even more anxious though anytime someone asks me what kind of music I like, especially if they want to know specific artists or songs. I feel like I always have to keep a mental list ready for when this comes up. I‚Äôm this way about a lot of things actually. It‚Äôs pretty ridiculous."
dpdr,fo96qyl,t3_g43tfd,1587611840.0,"This is truly amazing. This is the first time I‚Äôve really been able to grasp the concept of a 4th dimension, at least in terms of logic. I think you communicated this brilliantly. My experiences with DPDR have always felt like being hurled into an alternate reality or another dimension outside of the ‚Äúreal‚Äù physical world. Reading this from my DPDR perspective, I can actually visualize a 4th dimension. This is the first time I have seen this ‚Äúplace‚Äù I go to examined scientifically. I‚Äôm absolutely stunned. Thank you!"
dpdr,fo65325,t3_g46siv,1587546813.0,"I‚Äôm 99% sure you have sleep apnea. I have it and sometimes wake up like this multiple times in a row when I‚Äôm really exhausted and drifting off, just right before crossing the threshold into sleep. It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre actually not breathing and your body jolts you awake to start breathing again. While you‚Äôre not breathing, your blood oxygen levels drop and your heart starts beating faster to circulate more oxygenated blood but there‚Äôs not any. At some point your brain‚Äôs like oh shit I better wake up and start breathing again so we don‚Äôt die. Then, you suddenly wake up gasping for air in a panic. You dont know what‚Äôs happened but it feels like you had been stuck underwater for a long time and were about to die but at the last second you managed to get your head above water. It‚Äôs scary af but you‚Äôll eventually relax again and start to fall asleep again, just to start the whole process over.

All that said, I also have DPDR.... so maybe there is some connection haha"
dpdr,fo62t3c,t3_g489b4,1587544385.0,"I‚Äôve had lived with depression, anxiety, OCD, and DPDR since I was a child. My mom told me I would go catatonic, like I was in a trance, as early as 3 years old. It‚Äôs hard for me to even fathom the idea of living effortlessly. I do know that I envy people who don‚Äôt carry around this crushing weight and would love to know what it‚Äôs like to have that freedom. At the same time, I think if I had that at some point and it was taken from me, I would probably be devastated and might be in an even worse place."
dpdr,fo610by,t1_fo5zk4a,1587542479.0,"This is a perfect description of my experiences. Like spot on. I am so shocked and relieved that other people get this.

I‚Äôve compared it to suddenly feeling like you‚Äôve stepped into another dimension that you weren‚Äôt supposed to have access to and you can see that everyone and everything, even your own physical self, is a simulated copy of something..... it‚Äôs like everything is just a representation of something real and it‚Äôs all being controlled from this other layer of reality that you‚Äôve somehow traveled to. Everything is right there in front of you physically, but you‚Äôre somewhere else far away. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve seen behind the curtain and know that someone‚Äôs pulling the strings but have no idea who or how or why, you just know that everything is hollow and lifeless in the world you had been living in.

I still feel strange saying all that but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not completely alone!!"
dpdr,fo5yntw,t3_g51v8w,1587540083.0,"I don‚Äôt necessarily experience dpdr because of OCD but I do have both and think there is a very strong link between the two. I think my OCD actually developed around the same time that my DPDR experiences really started to ramp up, when I was 8 or 9 years old. I feel your pain.... it truly sucks living both of these afflictions."
dpdr,fo5uo9n,t3_g5s5g6,1587536266.0,"I have a lot of visual triggers similar to this. Driving or being out in an open area when it is very sunny or being in a room with bright fluorescent lights often triggers DPDR for me. Also, I am very sensitive to the color tone and darkness of sunglasses as certain variations can trigger DPDR and others can improve it. I was thinking about this phenomena today actually because I recently bought a pair of sunglasses that have a rosy tint to them and I can‚Äôt wear them because it immediately freaks me out when I put them on. Guess I don‚Äôt like the way the world looks through rose-colored glasses ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
dpdr,fo5sumz,t3_g5akrk,1587534603.0,"THANK YOU!!!! I always thought if i told people I felt this way about my DPDR experiences I would be written off as a total nut, but this is exactly how I feel about it. For me, the ‚Äúknowing‚Äù is the most terrifying aspect of it. So glad someone brought this to light."

confessions,fnkmyaj,t3_g27dtv,1587033230.0,"Your parents seem like ignorant assholes. I definitely feel for you. I also have dissociative disorders (started experiencing episodes of derealization/depersonalization as early as 4 years old), severe OCD that started around 9 years old, depression, generalized anxiety and a host of other mental health issues. I‚Äôve also attempted suicide with near success when I‚Äôve been off meds and landed myself in the mental hospital for emergency detainment on multiple occasions. Believe me, I understand how infuriating it is when people undermine the seriousness of mental health issues, or just don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. Most of the time I think this dismissal is due to pure ignorance and lack of education..... other times I think it‚Äôs the lack of the ability to comprehend or accept anything outside their own little bubble.

Hopefully your parents are just uneducated and actually do have the capacity and willingness to learn the scientific FACTS related behind your issues. If they are actually stubborn, stupid twats and have made up their minds that your psychological and physiological issues are not real, I am really sorry for you. I would suggest finding an online community (or in-person community if we ever get out of fucking quarantine) that offers support from others coping with similar disorders. Also, can you maybe see about contacting your therapist/psychiatrist yourself? Maybe they could provide sessions without your parents involvement, or at least intervene and try to reason with them or give you some kind of guidance on what to do. 

Mental illness is a silent battle that we have to fight every day of our lives. It‚Äôs easy for people to reject things they can‚Äôt see or that aren‚Äôt affecting them personally - shit, it wasn‚Äôt that long ago that the ‚Äúpresident‚Äù was telling everyone the Coronavirus was a hoax and look where we are now. Just please know that even though it feels like you are completely alone and that no one around you gets it, there is still hope and there are still some others out in the world fighting through it with you. I know we don‚Äôt know each other, but please know that there is an actual living, breathing human behind this post and I am here for you if you need someone. Don‚Äôt give up!"
