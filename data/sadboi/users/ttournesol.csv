Idk, obviously people are more outspoken on twitter about any jokes that seem insensitive so when you add that to the fact that Matty is someone they prob really admire & he has created a progessive community/culture with 1975 fans it's easy to see why they feel the need to comment when he does or says something they dont agree with.

It's so hard to change the way you've lived for years and it's like a way of protecting yourself, so putting yourself out there is a huge step.

Going to therapy will help you to find ways to make changes but if that's not a possibility for you, I would say try to think about things you enjoy doing and see if there are any classes for that. Exercise classes would be good to begin with, as theres little personal interaction, but then you can build up to more group activities. Also, when you feel up to it, just head out by yourself.

If 2019 was not good to you, 2020 can and will be better. Look after yourself and focus on what will make you happy."
LetsTalkMusic,fckxrid,t3_ehplge,1577735465.0,"Oh for sure! People looked down on the Beatles because of the frenzy and ""Beatlemania"" that surrounded them. 
But at the same time teenage girls tend to be the tastemakers. They made justin bieber and one direction two of the biggest artists of the last decade, just as they boosted the Beatles.
