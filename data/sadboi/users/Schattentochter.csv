Nowadays I know the people around me were just jerks from start to finish but back then it felt like a trade - I do the thing you expect of me and in exchange you stop treating me like dirt.

It started with the cool girl. ""Pff, catcalls are a compliment, what are those drama queens on about?""; ""Yeah, I totally don't care if someone rips on me."" (spoiler alert - I very much did care). I even *apologized* for not liking beer. Because, ya know, how could I dare and break the rules of what the best drink is? (Whoever wonders - yeup, toxic group of guys and the few girlfriends all were trapped in that whole spiel)

Later came the mpdg - I was still pretty lonely but I had a friend, Miry. She *IS* that trope to the core - and what I noticed was that people liked her. They liked her quirks and her attitude and her sunshine. So I thought ""If I go a bit more in that direction, that'll help.""

In reality, both tropes are a part of me to an extent. I'm no longer auto-sexist, but I'm definetely more on the laid back side (and these days I enjoy a cold one :D) - and I've always been quirky.

AmItheAsshole,fr0si43,t1_fqyfo4x,1589805626.0,"See, I think you are misreading me. Because my actual point is ""If it's all that harmless, why didn't they just ask? Why did they decide to do something that involves my very personal belongings without giving me a chance to agree to that or prevent it in case it makes me uncomfortable?""

I see a stomped boundary the second someone touches it without asking permission. If they do that without giving me a chance to be a part of the decision, what else do they do? Do I have to lock my medicine cabinet now in case they get curious what medication I own? 

And that wasn't the reach at all, but if you read it like that, you do you. And if you properly read what I wrote, I told them they have every right to do what they want but that they simply shouldn't assume this for other people - because me not touching anyone's bra without consent doesn't lead to harm but someone stomping this boundary for someone like me would indeed cause harm. It's a very normal ""better safe than sorry""-thing.

And that's really all I'm gonna say to that because quite frankly, you kinda took from that what you felt like hearing and didn't give me any benefit of the doubt (as opposed to u/psychlolo who very much came from a place of empathy and understanding) and I don't have to own every weird opinion someone forms about me.

therapy,fqxk63v,t3_glgrk7,1589733552.0,"The most basic root of this lies usually in self-worth so there's no easy solution that can just make it go away - because only if we don't think of the worst meaning as the most likely one we can start to instinctively have brighter thoughts upon what we hear. - So, if it's an option for you, therapy is definetely recommended because somewhere at some point something hurt you deeply enough to set this line of thinking in motion.

That being said, here's a few things that have helped me in the past:

1. ""What if it isn't, though?"" -> So, my mind goes on a rampage, saying things like ""What if they think of you as the ultimate failure now? What if they hate you? What if tomorrow you have noone left?"" - and I fire back ""What if that doesn't happen? What if they genuinely empathize and love me? What if they're thinking about how to help me?"" -> The idea is basically to break the pattern by introducing positive ideas as equally *possible*.

2. ""You don't get a say."" - this is something that CBT (Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy) and a few other systems like to work with. Essentially, the nagging voice is called ""the inner critic"" (or something similar) and as such given its own place in the collective of our thoughts. Said inner critic can be helpful (""You can do better here."") but with low self worth, it usually isn't. So - visualize this inner critic sitting in front of you just spilling one cynical, annoyingly pessimistic phrase after another like a teenager who doesn't want to go on the family trip and *let it know that it needs to get its shit together*, so to speak. ""If you do not have anything helpful to offer, you are not who I want to listen to right now.""; By creating a distance between you as a person and the intrusive thoughts, you can get a chance to *argue against them*, question them and question the general purpose of the thoughts. So they are there - but they don't get the talking stick right now.

3. ""What is the purpose?"" - I'm not a therapist, but I do have a certificate in systemic coaching and this is where I got this one from - every single urge and worry and doubt we get come from a place of wanting something good for us. Anxiety is our subconscious trying to keep us safe, distrust and paranoia often happen because our subconscious is trying to keep us from being hurt again. Constant self-doubt is often rooted in the wish to achieve something, to ""prove our worth"", etc. - So it can help to ask yourself where the criticism is coming from and what it actually wants. ""They totally judge you right now."" - this is a fearful part of you speaking, scared of loss and the potential loneliness following. And behind that sits a simple desire for comfort, safety and wanting to belong. This is a completely normal desire in a human - and by showing compassion to yourself about it, you can work with those thoughts the way they are intended. 

4. Defiance. That one is tricky if self-worth is low, but if not overdone, it can really help (or at least it helped me) -> ""If this person really, actually and in full posession of their mental abilities decides that I am utter scum simply and only because I am going through something, then this person is fricking awful. Just what the hell?"" -> Now, if it's a good friend, you get the immediate reflex to defend them because most likely they are absolutely not ""fricking awful"". On the other hand, you question the toxic idea (that is most likely solely in your head) and get to decide that it is not right, that even IF those people thought all those horrible things, that would be *them* doing a bad thing as opposed to you.


Sorry for the novel - and again, I really recommend trying to dig beyond ""this just happens"" and down to the why of it all - but I sincerely hope that maybe you can find something helpful in the stuff I shared. :) Good luck."

I kinda disagree on the ""less creepy reasons"", though. As I see it, the act is creepy no matter the reason with the only exception being a fictional and extreme example like ""the person's life depends on it"" - just like how violence is just bs unless it's self-defense. 

And I don't know what all you do when peeps aren't looking but personally, I act pretty much the same except for a few quirks like singing in the shower or dancing with my vacuum cleaner. I've often had the urge to snoop but I most certainly never did and I hope my friends are the same - which is not to accuse you of anything (!!!!), I'm just saying that while I can fully relate to the urge, I just think people can definetely be expected to have enough self-control to respect this boundary until they've been explicitly told by someone that they don't have that boundary for themselves."

So instead of arguing with the group of people who actually fails to recognize and acknowledge the issues men face, they argue with people who are fully aware and struggling too. It often reminds me of the habit in right-wing parties to try and create a downward-kicking-hierarchy - like propagating racism so people think more about ""immigrants taking their jobs"" than companies hiring cheap workers from foreign countries and undermining unions for their own benefit.

PublicFreakout,fqwyw56,t1_fqwmt3b,1589721622.0,"The burden of change has been pushed onto the consumer for decades but the reality of it is that this is a tactic used by the companies actually responsible. (I saw a documentary about the whole thing about a year ago.)

Companies who pay their workers not enough for them to even *consider* switching to electric cars, companies that sponsor political candidates who have anything on their agenda but building more charging stations for e-cars or expanding the public transport network, companies researching and producing products that strictly rely on the resources  *they* offer (oil and gas) and so on - those hold far more influence in *one* place than an average person can ever achieve.

So, yes, *theoretically* if everyone joined forces, boycotted those companies and lived with the sacrifice, we could budge them. But that means that people need to risk losing their jobs or their comfort or something else that means a lot and while it's very easy to say ""Yeah, and they should be willing"", we all know it's never that simple.

It would, however, be *VERY* simple for CEOs like Nestle's to just fricking get themselves a spine and *do better*. The leaders of those companies hold the power in their hands right now and aren't using it - the general public is expected to have faith in their ability to affect everything when said ability would solely come through solidarity while at the same time our system is very much built stable enough to keep us in certain tracks (you can decide to boycott cars as much as you want - if you show up late for work, you're getting it)."

Women are most certainly capable to be creeps and it doesn't even matter whether they're being creeps because of a sexual interest or just a lack of understanding of boundaries - people don't touch people's intimate belongings, full stop.

Besides, she could be a lesbian and a creep. What would make such a woman different from a heterosexual, male creep?

It's one thing to forgive the urges because curiosity can get strong - but forgiving the act and relativizing it based on a benefit of doubt towards women is a generalization of genders and relativizes creepy behavior in women way too much.

It starts so slow, so breezy and nice, but the second they start with the abuse, there's no going back and there's no keeping it mild. It *will* escalate. And you want to be out long before he has a chance.

He made you USED TO bullshit like ""I give you my permission"" - don't wait until he takes away your concept of normality even more. Don't wait until he breaks you to ask yourself whether any feeling of love can ever be healthy if it leads to you going through things like that.

Remember what normal is. Normal people don't say shit like ""I give you permission""; normal people don't freaking *spank their girlfriend* because she wants a fair share of Netflix decisions. NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T PURPOSEFULLY HURT THEIR LOVED ONES.

If you do the talk first and the calling out second, she can't wiggle out of it. ""We have talked about this. We have told you about the boundary. You have crossed it again.

family,fqpan72,t1_fqo9rb7,1589540861.0,"I'm not sure if I agree. She uses excuses to touch his body and thus desensitize him for the natural ""don't do that""-reaction he obviously has - and if you ask me, it's quite obvious what she is aiming for.

She almost touched his butt - sure, it would be a debate in front of the law whether that is ""serious enough"" to qualify as assault, but ""hitting on him"" is definetely too harmless a phrasing for what she is doing. There's sexual harassment in there with all the comments - especially considering the fact that she has a bf and the guy she is trying to get with has a gf so there's a reasonable premise of ""no interest"" - and in my opinion, the definition of grooming does apply.

Nowhere in the definition does it say that only kids and teens can be groomed (but even then, the bf counts as a 19 year old) - and if it did so, that'd be awfully wrong. And grooming doesn't always have to be sexual either - you can groom someone into a soldier as well (done to way too many children all over the globe)."
creepyPMs,fqp9n8h,t1_fqntdtt,1589539922.0,"Probably quite a few more considering that the tactic was used by ancient peoples too - and usually failed.

The only exception I can think of is Vlad III who, as far as sources go, quite effectively lowered the crime rate in Walachia through his more than cruel methods - but if you decorate your country with impaled people, I don't know if you really should get a sticker for that.

Afaik, it's not a proven story, but there's this ""myth"" that at the peak of his reign, he put a golden goblet that was covered in jewels on the well of a city and used the fact that noone ever took it as proof that noone dared to commit crime in his country anymore.

Anyway, sorry for the tangent - in general, as far as I've read, only the peoples and rulers who went completely batshit actually managed to deter people from committing crimes - and that usually just lead to them sooner or later forming a rebellion instead and commit treason instead of theft."
niceguys,fqp92wp,t1_fqnkhgv,1589539375.0,"I'm a bit confused. Why ""*especially* small women with tiny/fragile/disabled frames"" and what does ""fire they need to burn"" refer to?

Edit: Also, how do ""tiny"" and ""fragile"" connect to ""disabled"" exactly? Sure, some disabled women are petite and with some disabilities you can be ""fragile"", I guess, but in general those two don't automatically go together. (And I can say right now that people would most definetely rather be in a fight with me than my sister.)"
niceguys,fqlqzby,t1_fqlpptn,1589464392.0,"Ohhh, tell me about it. I'm not disabled myself but I'm a wheelchair user's little sister. The amount of people trying to baby her is ridiculous.

My favourite was when we went up a mountain and she decided she wanted to struggle up the steep, rocky path herself. I got glares from everyone who walked past us for just walking next to her and at least 8 people tried to just randomly jump in and push her - to which they got a very displeased reaction from my sister.

Point being - we fricking need to stop seeing ""disabled people"" and start seeing ""people who happen to be disabled"" or the ones like this girl you've mentioned (oof, that made me all kinds of uncomfortable while reading) will never stop getting their fix on it, I fear.

And if I ever meet someone who wouldn't grab the coffee without asking in that situation, I'll definetely question their social skills. What the hell was this dude thinking that he assumed he could just... debate his way into this? You said no, that should've sufficed to begin with."

Obviously there's more to the story than ""I watched porn"", but I can most definetely say that porn didn't fricking help.
