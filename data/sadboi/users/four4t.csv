The LG doesn't as much. But the Nexus still does and I got the phone a year after it came out. No it didn't get 10 but it was 3 or 4 years old by that point. It was also less than half the price with 3 major updates. 
Not 2 updates for double the price."

Tell her that she could possibly take that dress back to the place you got it and have some alternations made. It might make it a little different from the other. But it'll be cheaper than getting a new dress if that is what she's worried about."

I'm not a fan of apple but they normally get a few years of updates.
The phone can still run higher os's give them to the people. I paid 2k nzd for my phone to be told it won't update next year. I have 5 months left on my phone's 24 month contract not gonna be buying a phone this expensive again for it to work for 2 years. 
My LG g2 min still works reasonably well, and so does my Nexus 6p in comparison to the price of this one."

Coz she expects stuff to be done for her. 
I got her a full time job and she lived with me while there for free and wouldn't help out. She did buy food occasionally but it was normally for her. But if we had some that was okay. We were expected to cook, clean, wash her clothes, hang out the clothes etc while she was there. It's what she does to my parents. But they think the light shines out her ass."

My sister demanded I clean up coz she needed the bench in which I took up less than 30cm and they have another 2m of bench she could have used.

We we're lucky that with my grandfather, his car broke down so we just said we couldn't fix it. It was fixed and sold though. He got the money. We just paid for taxi chips.
