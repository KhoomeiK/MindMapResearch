If anything, he may play it off like nothing happened and that is more ""abusive"" to her since her feelings are going to be invalidated. I'm just drawing conclusions here though, none of us know the full story. In any case, she did the right thing instead of being passive aggressive about it later.

mentalhealth,fgkd01k,t1_fgkbjdn,1580862702.0,"Thank you for words of affirmation. I see your point that some people seek validation but I'm still going to push back on them too. Call me a bad guy, call me self righteous, whatever. I have no gain from it other than the fact that I may be of service to someone who needs it. And frankly, sometimes people tell us not what we want to hear but what we need to hear and it makes a world of a difference. I understand that some people have severe long term depression but I dont think it's an excuse to accept your circumstances and move through life not challenging yourself to heal. Of course, this isnt the case for everyone, just a subset of people. From my experience, many people in this subreddit seem to assume if you're giving advice on mental health, you didnt once suffer from crippling depression yourself and you're looking at them from ""above"". Some people figure out how to help themselves sooner than others and then it feels good to be able to tell others THERE IS HOPE. It's silly to be upset with people for doing so. Its literally all an attempt to help someone. It may not be you but it may be someone else. 

And honestly, theres always room for debate but I sincerely believe suicide is never an option. Your life is too precious and unique to be thrown away because of circumstances. Theres literally only ONE of you. You really, really can change your circumstances despite what you FEEL are your limitations. 

I'm in university now and in an honors research program that I never thought I'd get into. We have professors come to class twice a week and discuss what they work on in their labs as well as how they made it to where they are. Its so fascinating hearing all these extremely successful people level with us undergrads and tell us they had no idea what they were doing either; they were miserable and scared but just kept pushing and taking on new opportunities and eventually they made it. It's so influential to me to know that these successful people were people like you and me who didn't feel like they were good enough or smart enough or whatever. Half of the professors who lectured talked about their crippling ""imposter syndrome"". Some even still experience it despite running a massive, successful lab. And see, just listening to other peoples anecdotal experience honestly gave me a lot of peace of mind moving forward. No one knows where they're going to end up, you just keep moving forward, facing challenges, taking opportunities as they present themselves, and you eventually end up somewhere you like. If not, you backtrack and start over. Theres no point in giving up. We ALL get sad and disheartened, it's a natural human state of being. But I genuinely am sorry for the outliers who genuinely have genetic dispositions for depression and other mental circumstances that hinder their progress. I still believe in you though, I know you can be successful as long as you continue fighting and moving forward."
mentalhealth,fgk9fbi,t1_fgjucjb,1580860367.0,"That's what I'm saying, yet it's being taken out of context. Of course I encourage open discourse about any topic, especially mental health, but it makes me sad and uncomfortable when I see people suggesting that suicide is an option for some. Many of the people who commit suicide dont exhaust all their options before doing so, they just feel like the have had enough. If I can make a comment, such as an anecdotal experience or some poetic analogy, that makes people reconsider, I definitely will. As I mentioned in another comment, this subreddit is not an echo chamber. I refuse to allow it to be one. 

I'm glad you're still here, though. I'm glad you didnt go through with it. The world needs you here. 

P.s. I'm also dreaming of doing grad school at stanford ... university....if that's what you're referring to haha."
mentalhealth,fgk8hfs,t1_fgk7j8c,1580859762.0,"Theres a website called meetup.com. I know its active in America, I'm not sure if it is elsewhere. But what I'm about to suggest is just one option. 
There are group hikes you can join. A significant amount of people attend. Typically, there aren't restrictions on who can join. Sometimes theres all female ones but you can find inclusive ones too. Its nice to get out with a group and be in nature. Most of them are usually friendly and it's a great way to make platonic friends and do activities regularly. And, it's free! Also, people who tend to be depressed, myself included, try to stay home as often as possible. It's important to get out, get sunlight, get fresh air, and interact with others (even if it's just passive in the beginning).

You can also volunteer. This is a great option! I read an article at some point in the past regarding people who have less depressive symptoms after committing to volunteering for some period of time. I imagine its because you start to feel like you're contributing to society as well as getting out of your own head. If youre busy doing something, you're not really thinking about things that make you sad. I could be wrong though.

There are sports teams you can join, fun active or artistic classes in college (if you're low income you can apply for grants and not pay for college -- that's what I did), etc. 

If these dont work for you, I can brainstorm other options. But they're pretty great ways to get involved. I've done all of these personally. I feel my best what I'm being altruistic so maybe it could help you too. 

Goodluck!"

If you're being dealt bad cards, change your hand -- move, find a new job, get a pet, do SOMETHING. *I did*. Dont leave yourself in the same place you've been that's been making you depressed.  ‚ÄúWhen a flower¬†doesn't¬†bloom, you fix the¬†environment in which it grows, not the¬†flower."" 

My friend was just telling me last night that his brother had gotten divorced after a 15 year marriage and his life was in shambles. My friend kept pushing his brother to make a change in his life because change tends to bring with it growth. He said his brother bought a ticket to Africa and left the next day. While in Uganda, he found the woman of his dreams and my friend tells me the woman is a saint and they just welcomed a new baby. Sure, he was dealt shitty hands but he decided to shuffle the deck and get a new set of cards. 

People, dont victimize yourself. Honestly, there's no  benefit. We all get dealt shitty hands sometimes, some worse than others. Seek help and perturb yourselves, put yourself in a new environment in which you can blossom. Keep exhausting your options. Suicide shouldn't be the answer when you haven't really put the effort to make significant changes. I know it may FEEL like you've tried, but I'm talking big changes that really make someone uncomfortable. For me, it was moving out of my parents home to a new city and going to university for a difficult major. 

Also, as a side note, it's really eerie to see people normalize suicide. It's not okay. Someone is reading what you write and is being influenced. Use your words with care and consideration."
