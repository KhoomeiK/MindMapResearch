snes,fqqyg6t,t1_fqqjrnd,1589574245.0,OMG forgot about Turtles in Time was obsessed with that gem when I was a kid.  Would solo it all the time!
snes,fqp7ccg,t1_fqnp77t,1589537625.0,Sunset riders is an underrated classic
SkyChildrenOfLight,fqjnzuo,t1_fqiwave,1589412681.0,Hey! I actually ended up running them today solo but will do it again tomorrow if you’d like to join
TwitchStreaming,fqitsc8,t3_gj3v0y,1589400788.0,Thr is is incredible!!! Keep up the awesome work!
VALORANT,fqi4g2a,t1_fqhx1g0,1589389920.0,It’s not that I’m upset my whole thing is is A do you need to talk shit but 2 if you’re gonna talk shit at least have the game to back it up
VALORANT,fqgybja,t1_fqgqm7g,1589361390.0,Dude same.  I just got out of a match top fraggers were cool lowest player other team starts talking shit after the game. like you're 5 and 20 bruv
VALORANT,fqglwj0,t1_fqg3wg2,1589349858.0,Dude yeah. Like...I  don't think it was that EZ for u buddy.
VALORANT,fqfaz3p,t1_fqf9tfc,1589321705.0,Agreed! So much! Like make a call out bruv don’t be an asshole
VALORANT,fqf9kpb,t1_fqf94mz,1589321011.0,Agreed.
VALORANT,fqf9f59,t1_fqf8jq1,1589320935.0,Hahaha
VALORANT,fqf9ccj,t1_fqf90mg,1589320897.0,Sure I can understand where the frustration comes I’ve been there before but like that’s gonna happen. But I also don’t believe if you’re too frag you’re actually helping your team. There’s so much utility in the game that you can helping your team win in other ways.
TwitchStreaming,fqf7pbw,t3_ghxlyi,1589320104.0,Great game!
gamers,fqe99gw,t3_gicg49,1589303824.0,This gets me!
earthbound,fqasc0l,t3_ghocga,1589224433.0,Wow that’s really good for a doodle!
earthbound,fq6ubd0,t1_fq6t8yf,1589137946.0,Daaaaang I guess that’s not so bad. I’m pretty slow I guess. It’s been pretty fricking fun though in the meantime.
retrogames,fq6u6w6,t1_fq6tbkr,1589137902.0,So if this post was deleted what other was ? I mean it’s sad that this what you’re spending most of your day doing and even if there is another post that’s deleted which could be i don’t keep track of this nonsense who cares. Like the guy who commented on this post commented on the other. And there’s a bunch of people commenting with good feedback and interactions so isn’t that what Reddit’s all about interacting with people. If you want to be a troll be a troll I guess
earthbound,fq6qdp5,t1_fq3thtj,1589136404.0,Noted thank you!!!  That’s really helpful. Out of curiosity how long is this game? Like a typical rpg length assuming 60hours?
retrogames,fq6oquj,t1_fq5hhse,1589135612.0,What are you talking about?  Deleting what threads. I removed one thread. You should probably stay out of conversations that you don’t know about
retrogames,fq5cjnm,t1_fq3siyu,1589100205.0,"Not all of my post are copied and paste but yes people have told me that they have come from subs and I do get an analytics report saying where people have come from and it specifically says reddit. 

Also to be fair the other sub that i was posted is getting a lot of comments and interactions without people complaint it’s been really nice meeting, talking and getting helpful advice from them. So you must not be part of that sub."
retrogames,fq3o1g1,t1_fq3nj3q,1589068328.0,I mean I don’t know what to tell you but people have come in from this sub reddit to play along with me. And people have messaged me about where they can go to watch. So if they’re asking I figured it might be easier to just post a link this time.
gamers,fq2a9l9,t3_ggennn,1589054246.0,Hideo hands down!
animation,fq28mib,t3_ggf5fi,1589053814.0,So like what did you use to make this?
snes,fq27fuz,t3_gfuyf9,1589053509.0,Woah what am I looking at right now?
retrogames,fq26w9f,t1_fq0hsxm,1589053370.0,I’ve already responded to your dumb accusation in another post you decided to respond to. You can have a look there.
snes,fq23u2y,t1_fq0i91x,1589052581.0,"Woah that’s not true at all I did have people give me advice and help me out. And people did ask me to come join because they really liked the game. So I don’t know where these unclaimed attacks are coming from

I literally just had a bunch of people sending me posts about where to go and helping out in the game. And just because I was thankful and wanted to show some appreciation to a sub for helping me. Doesn’t make it ingenious at all. 

Also if you look at the truly small streamers it only has like 5 people in it who aren’t very active. Like seriously that’s what you’re going after. How much deep digging did you have to do to pull that up??  What’s wrong with you?"
snes,fq233b1,t1_fq0b1iy,1589052399.0,The mushrooms when they infect you is so annoying. But at least you get money from them which is nice
snes,fq22nah,t1_fpxzvem,1589052284.0,These teddy bears have been uber helpful omg. Especially in this early game thanks!
snes,fpxtc4f,t1_fpxt420,1588989158.0,I did end up figuring out how to get the bike. Suuuuuper helpful. Thank you!
snes,fpxskk4,t1_fpxsai0,1588988720.0,Good point. I’m thinking I should help Apple kid because people keep talking about him
snes,fpxpqvh,t1_fpxppgt,1588987106.0,That’s the one. CAn I help both out?
earthbound,fpxm25w,t1_fpxluma,1588985134.0,A Hahahaha of course duhhhhh! Thank you!!!
snes,fpxm0z2,t1_fpxkx2q,1588985117.0,"Anything really if there’s like oh man I should get this now or do this because it will help later on that’s fine too or any cool Easter eggs that I should check out. 

Last time I had some peeps come join me from the community they helped me through while I streamed which was pretty fun too!"
earthbound,fpxlsvg,t1_fpxj15o,1588984994.0,Where do I get that?

VALORANT,fpptfiv,t1_fppt7vr,1588808801.0,If that’s the case then is t all comp just milestones rather than skill because what about people who get carried
depression,fpptagw,t3_gea6mo,1588808724.0,Woooooaaahhh that’s not true all. Look maybe if a person doesn’t consider you their best friend doesn’t mean that you don’t it means that you can reevaluate your relationship with that person. And then decide what to do from there.  There are lot people out there man. Just remember that
VALORANT,fppt12h,t1_fppsekj,1588808580.0,Well i understand that and that the ranks don't mean anything.  But they are fundamentally designed to represent a level of skill based on whatever they're parameters are.  So given their ranking system still holds value. So bronze means a you're a bronze skill level a platinum means you're a platinum skill level. based on that they can still at least even out the teams
jackboxgames,fpoyg5h,t1_fpnk3kh,1588792819.0,Daaaaang that’s annoying. But yea I get that this is an opinion but a few of these I agreed with looking for some more packs to get
