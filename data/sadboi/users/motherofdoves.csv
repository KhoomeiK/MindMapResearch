There was other family in the house but they escaped. Its so tragic and confusing. Though with this woman, it was a little different because her dad was never really a good guy.

Not wearing clothes/undies doesn't mean you're looking for sexy time. Its whats comfortable, or in your situation it's more like necessity or practicality. That's not sexual and its kinda gross to me that he made it into something sexual.

mentalhealth,flaj1fh,t3_fnk22w,1584984858.0,"That's dumb on their part, loneliness does not mean the same thing as sexless. Hell, you could even be in a relationship and feel lonely. When I was with my abusive ex, that had to have been the lonelinest I've ever felt in my entire life. I'm sorry that their stupidity invalidated your feelings.

I've been where you are. I had meaningless sex with dozens of people because I craved intimacy in any way I could get it. And for me it never made me feel any less lonely. Because when the sun came up the next day, they'd be gone and besides that, I could never share anything real with them. I couldn't tell them about my feelings, or just sit there and play video games or go hiking or any of the things where we just enjoyed each others company. Hook ups don't fix loneliness. Hook ups are easy, meaningful relationships are not.

There's a few comments about getting physical with the bullies but I honestly think its better to just report them. ((Unless they are physically attacking you, in which case they opened the door to violence and I would say you should definitely fight back)) but when the bullying is strictly verbal/ online stuff I feel like it's way better to just document that shit and report it.

 I did that in high school and all the bullies got a warning, they had to sign a document that said they'd leave me alone and if they didn't they'd be suspended. They all ganged up on me that same day. My friend took me to the principal's office and we immediately reported it and they got suspended. The bullies were just shocked. And some of them bothered me when they got back and got suspended again. Then it all died down because they realized they couldn't be awful to me without a consequence.

relationships,fdhsim7,t3_eld5bs,1578429335.0,"Your story resonates with me, my father went sober almost exactly 2 years ago. At the time he went sober our relationship was almost nonexistent. I had a lot of resentment towards him for things he did and said to me when I was a teenager. Part of his 12 step program was to make amends. It was about a year and a half ago, he sat me down and apologized to me for all these things he did when he was fucked up. And it shocked me because I didnt even know he was fucked up when he said those things to me. 

The apology didnt sit right with me. I resented him for not doing it sooner. I felt like he was only sorry because his program told him he had to be. If he was actually sorry he shouldve apologized years before. After his apology, I told him I appreciated it, but that his words dont have the power to repair our relationship all these years later. If that was going to happen, it would take time for us both to heal. To find what our common ground is. I basically told him he has to start being my dad again and time would tell if we could be close again. 

And today, we are closer than I ever thought possible. Him going sober was the best thing to ever happen in terms of our relationship. I have so much respect for my dad. I am so grateful he got clean and started being a father to me. Yes, it would've been great to have him there in my teen years, but it's better late than never. 

I just wanted to share my experience with you because I know stuff like this is going to take time. You're really going to have to rebuild those relationships from the ground up. It's not an easy thing to do, but your kids will be grateful you did one day. Now that you're sober, you can be a better parent to them, it will certainly take time to figure out what ways you can do that, but you will. Just stick to your sobriety program, be patient with yourself and hopefully your family can be patient and supportive of you as well. Best of luck!"
MomForAMinute,fd0eg84,t3_ejiwfo,1578117655.0,"Hi Sis,

I'm so sorry you had to experience something like this. It makes me angry that someone would hurt you this way. I had a very similar experience myself about this time last year. I understand how difficult it can be to overcome. I know what you mean when you say it's difficult to distinguish those affectionate touches from the others. I think time is very healing, but in situations like this, sometimes time is not enough. If you are able to get into some sort of therapy to help you process this, I think that you might find it helpful. And if you are up for it, try learning martial arts. I started doing it over the summer and it has really helped me to regain my sense of control. Plus I met some very lovely people along the way.

Please remember you are not alone. You have people who care about you and want to support you. I am so sorry this has happened to you. Dont forget to be kind to yourself, what happened to you is not your fault."

When I broke up with him he broke into my house and then days later he was calling me and threatening to kill himself. 

I told him that wasnt my problem and he shouldn't tell me about it. I knew he was bluffing and just trying to manipulate me. He accused me of not caring if he killed himself. I told him it's not that I wouldn't care, but because of his actions, it was not my responsibility to talk him down. 

He ended up showing up to my moms house, showed her some cuts he had on his arm and she said pretty much the same thing. And she told him if he was really struggling, he needed to go talk to his own mom."

mentalhealth,fb1dsmj,t3_eawvd1,1576435462.0,"I was 51/50 at age 14 for attempting suicide. Got sent to a mental hospital and it was terrible. But I couldn't be released for 72 hours. The therapist there was awful. He would sit there in the office and say ""how are you doing?"" And then expect you to fill the silence for the next 20-30 minutes. He tried to get my parents to leave me there longer as I was ""still depressed"" since I never talked. I'd just tell him I'm doing okay, cause you know, I'm alive. And then sit in silence because I didnt know what the fuck else to say. 

There were some wonderful staff there. It was the nurses/aids. The ones who were basically just there to keep an eye on everyone. They had such big hearts and really cared for us. But the therapists who lead the group therapy and the guy who did the private sessions were awful. We were afraid to be honest about still being depressed because they'd try to keep you there longer. And if you mentioned having thoughts of suicide then youd go on a 24 hour watch. You couldn't sleep in your bed that night and had to sleep on the floor with a security guard watching you all night. One time a girl was freaking out, I assume she was having a panic attack. But the poor girl was just falling to pieces and crying and I couldn't really understand what was going on but I heard the staff almost threaten her. ""Do you want to sleep on the floor again?"" And i dont know what the situation was with her but i just thought it was messed up that she had to push her feelings away because she didnt want to sleep on the floor that night. 

I didnt realize how bad that place was until I progressed on my mental health journey and learned what effective therapy was like. I also just think it's so twisted that everyone there needed help with their mental health and all we were really taught was that there was consequences to sharing your most authentic feelings."

creepyPMs,faokpvm,t3_ea4qst,1576266525.0,"I worked at this smoothie shop when I was 17-18. My manager at the time left me alone in the shop because we were out of strawberries or something and he had to run to the store across the street to grab some. It was early, like 8am in the winter so I didnt expect anyone to come in. 

Guy walks in and orders. I'm using my friendly, smiling customer service attitude when I take his order. Then i go in the back and make his food. When i bring it out he doesnt sit down with it or walk out. He just leans on the counter and starts talking. ""You must be new"" 

Me: no, I've been working here about six months
Him: oh well you must not be here that often. I've never seen you before
Me: I actually work here full time.

I started feeling weird cause this guy was acting like he was a regular, but I knew all the regulars and I'd never seen this dude before. I also regretted telling him I worked there full time as soon as I said it. I think he made a little bit more awkward small talk before he leaned in and said ""are you working all alone?""
That sent shivers up my spine. I was super freaked out. I was alone and it was obvious because I took his order and made his food. I said ""yes, but my manager should be back any minute. Which is good cause I need help putting our food order away"" trying to act super casual. 
I told him I should go back and start working on it. And say thank you for coming then awkwardly walk back there. There was no order coming that day which is why my manager had to get strawberries. Theres a big window so we can see into the lobby from the kitchen. I pretended to be busy while I watched him through the window until he left and then my manager returned a few minutes later. I told him everything. He said he'd keep an eye out for the guy but we never saw him again."
unpopularopinion,faoi2q4,t3_ea64or,1576264831.0,"I dont disagree. Women can be mean and definitely notice these things much more than men. However, I also think a big part of this comes from a womans internal dialogue with herself. 

I've met lots of girls who are like that, very concerned about their makeup and not rewearing outfits and things. But I'll be completely honest, as a woman, I will not notice if another woman wears an outfit twice. And if I do notice, it's because the outfit is so amazing it stood out to me. In which case, I'm glad shes wearing it again! I think that a lot of women think that everyone is going to notice this and that about them but really that's just coming from an internal place of insecurity and doubt. I also say this because, even though women can be so mean and critical of each other, that shouldn't influence how you dress. 

We should all have the confidence to wear whatever we like. And if someone says something rude about us, screw them. That says far more about them as a person than anything else. The fact that anyone wastes their time concerning themselves with what I choose to wear is not my problem."
AskWomen,fao84bt,t3_ea3iup,1576259118.0,"When we moved in together. We started dating in high school and then moved in together after I graduated.

But then we lived together, both attending college. And he quit his job, never did anything around the house and cheated in classes. I felt blindsided by his nonexistent work ethic.

Women should be able to do whatever they want. If they want to reject what is traditionally considered feminine, great! And if they want to embrace what is traditionally considered feminine that's great too! It should be about our rights to be whoever we want.

KindVoice,fa9eg65,t3_e819sk,1575870624.0,"Hi there, 
(I'm 20F) I understand how you are feeling. Trust me when I say it, I've been there. I want to make it clear, you are so brave and strong to have gotten out of an abusive relationship. That is a very difficult thing to do. It took me several years to leave my abusive ex boyfriend. 

I'm sorry most of your friends didnt support you. But it's also good that one of your friends did. I think moments like that can be really telling of who is and isn't in your corner. Not everyone can be or is in the place to offer such sound support. One good friend means much much more than 10 people who won't step up when you need them. 

As for your ex and that relationship- please dont ever blame yourself. There is nothing you couldve done differently to avoid that outcome. Abusive partners will typically start off very loving and then at some point or another, their abusive nature comes out. And that has nothing to do with you. It is entirely on him and I'm just so sorry you went through that. I know how difficult that is.

Sorry if I'm rambling but one last thing... please dont end your life. I know that feeling all too well. It's a terrible place to be in. But it's worth hanging on. In my experience things got generally much better after high school, and I'm sure everyone says that and it's hard to look ahead when things are so difficult. When I feel really depressed I like to make lists of everything that makes me happy. The simpler the better. ""Petting a dog, warm sunny days, etc"" or sometimes I make lists of simple, silly little happy memories. It just helps me change my mindset and pull me away from that dark place. 

As difficult as this is for you, and trust me I know how painful it is, you have the strength to pull through. You will look back on these moments one day and see that have shaped you to be a much stronger person. I wish you the absolute best, beautiful life and if you need any support along the way, I'm just a reddit message away!"

I'm assuming if your dad was abusive towards you that him saying your mother never cared about you is not true. It sounds more like a manipulation tactic. 

I'm really sorry about your mother. I couldn't imagine what that must be like. Maybe you could open up about this to your foster parents? It sounds like you like them and maybe they have some parental love they can offer you. I know it's not the same, but maybe that would be helpful.

In my rehab I met a girl who had lost her father, and she found it helpful to write him notes. About anything and everything. Just to tell him how her day was, what she was accomplishing, or how much she missed him. It might be helpful if you put your feelings on paper.

But like someone else said, it's people like that who make you feel lonely. His response to you telling him that his joke made you upset is worse than him making the joke in the first place.

He is showing that he doesnt care about upsetting you and that's very alarming. My ex did things like this often. And if your situation is anything like how mine was... my best advice is to get out now, it only got worse and worse for me.

For a while I was all alone an it was hard. But in times like that people have a funny way of showing up for you. I found many people coming out of the woodwork to support me. Including long lost friends, my coworkers and my classmates.

You can do it! It takes a lot of strength. But I swear it pays off. Dont be afraid to be alone. Find good company in yourself. You are, and always will be your own best ally!"
