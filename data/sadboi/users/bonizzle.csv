NoStupidQuestions,fqo7ekv,t3_gj8mcn,1589509101.0,"I used to be very lactose intolerant but it’s gotten much better as I’ve gotten older for some reason. From my understanding, lactose intolerance is when your body does not have the enzymes that break down the lactose. You can buy the enzyme supplements that you eat with dairy foods. And i don’t know if this actually works, but i feel like it worked for me, but if you’re taking the enzymes or something else, some say you can ween yourself onto more lactose and the goal is to help your body start producing the enzymes again. Again, I have no guarantee that works but that’s what I did and I still drink lactose free milk but i eat cheese and ice cream and whatever and i get a lil gassy but i don’t get the gnarly pain anymore. I could probably drink normal milk again but I just am scared to try it lol. Also a fun fact, the more fat that is in the milk or dairy product, the less lactose is in it, so if you do drink real milk drink whole milk. Learned that one in chemistry."

Those relationships rarely start for the right reasons and I don’t think it’s a healthy thing to continue without making sure it’s not toxic and it’s not a power and control grab for you. You guys are both older now, buuuut i was in relationships like that when I was 15, was trapped in it for years because he was very manipulative, and I was traumatized and didn’t realize it until i was like 20. I was trauma bonded for years and still have a stockholm syndrome kind of thing and it is something that is very hard to realize. She’s def old enough now to make her own choices but if there was that age gap when she was 15-16, that’s really not a good start.

I used to have really bad dental hygiene, like not gonna lie i rarely brushed my teeth, like maybe once a week or less. I met my bf 3 years ago and now i brush my teeth at least once a day, usually twice. Which is a big improvement. My fiancé just wouldn’t kiss me if my breath was gross and if i didn’t brush my teeth, because he is kind of a germaphobe with spit. He explained to me that plague is literally a living thing, it’s a living bacteria that just feeds off everything i eat. Which i never thought about especially cause i never went to the dentist. Also my teeth always hurt when i eat sugar or something cold. So it didn’t offend me at all or make me sad, but it did motivate me to start brushing my teeth. We live together, and bed time is the hardest, so now he always reminds me at night and then we go brush together. The real kicker for me was when my friends breath smelled literally like dog shit, and i flossed, and smelled the plaque between my teeth in the back, and it had the same smell and it smelled like dog shit. So after that i was disgusted with plaque and the bad taste in my mouth. Now whenever i brush my teeth more often, i notice the bad smells in my mouth more and so i’m motivated to do it consistently. So maybe just have a serious talk about it and educate him why it’s so important to have good dental hygiene and why it’s gross to not. At the very least, mouth wash or flossing if he can’t brush his teeth at night. Even steps in the right direction are good."
TrueOffMyChest,fq42jhv,t3_ggrjq8,1589072960.0,"When I was 13 I had already attempted taking my life twice and was in a psych ward for 2 weeks. Not even my family gave a shit about me.

I didn’t think I would live past 18 but i’m so glad i did because even after all the bullshit i went through my life is a lot better now, i have a new appreciation and understanding of life, and a depth that most people don’t understand. I don’t know what advice I can give you other than just use your resources, depend on the people you have, try not to become your own enemy because it’s really easy to do but it’ll make things a lot worse for yourself. Try using self affirmations every day and write out letters to people you hate or just write out your feelings and then you can rip up the page, burn it, whatever it does help. Seek out medication or therapy if you can. Just try not to feed into your depression more than you have to, force yourself to shower and get sunshine and do things that are hard when you can. Pick up hobbies to occupy your mind so you don’t spiral. I played guitar, and then got into weight lifting, now i really like other art like embroidering, painting, drawing, and video games. Just make sure you do things even when they’re hard but it’s okay to take a break and be sad sometimes. Just don’t give into it and don’t let the depression become your personality."

Last 2 was long distance. Dan realized he didn’t want to be in a relationship with her pretty soon after they graduated, they were just different people and he just didn’t have any feelings for her anymore. He broke up with her and we met 6 months later and have been together for 3 years now, we’re super happy. I’d say it’s rare for first relationships to actually last and make it. Some do for sure, but it’s not a bad thing if you have to break up at some point. I’d say do some soul searching, and just remember if you do have to break up with your bf, that’s okay. We’re all constantly changing and sometimes people change and grow apart and become different people. It happens. Just make sure if you do want to go for the new guy, make sure to really look in the long run if you’ll still click with him after the infatuation of the risk and excitement goes away. I’d say it also depends on how your current relationship is going and if there’s an underlying issue or reason your becoming interested with someone else. It’ll be a big decision, but i don’t think there’s a right or wrong one."

Not saying you’re a shitty person like my ex was, but I can guarantee she isn’t mature enough to handle an adult relationship. I’m 20 right now and i can’t even imagine dating someone that’s in high school, it grosses me out. Most likely she is acting a lot more mature than she is because he likes the idea of an exciting relationship and the attention she gets from an older guy cause she feels “special”, but i don’t think she wants the same things you do. She’s going to pretend, but you guys are not on the same page. Dating her and having sex with her is 1. illegal (depending on where you are) and 2. is very likely to cause deep emotional damage for her that will set her up for failure. Teenage girls are fucking stupid, it’s the adults job to know better and make the responsible choices because she isn’t mature enough to know any better. And again i’m not saying you’re a shitty guy, i bet she’s really cute and flirty, but i’m pretty positive she’s faking how mature she is and moving forward will not end well for both of you."

I struggled with this with my SO about this time,  and we’ve been together for 3 years and live together and we’re doing great. In my personal opinion, how i came to my decision, is that he doesn’t annoy me like other people do, i can spend a majority of my time with him and not get tired of him, we still have a healthy sex life, we agree on the important things, and we have complementary strengths and weaknesses, and we just work really well together and we don’t fight because we learn how to communicate with each other. I did soul searching and realized all my doubts were just from my past and insecurities, and he is the best person i can build a life with, because even when we’re not feeling the fairy tale love (which of course sometimes we still do), i’m content and stability and contentment is happiness for me personally."

My moods just get much more erratic, i get more suicidal, and it’s sort of a depression episode but not like stay in bed all day, more like i’m going to yell at my fiancé and slam doors and cry over things and start self harming again and get decently close to killing myself. Keep in mind this was me off both lamictal and zoloft usually. But yeah, lamictal also helps me dissociation issues for some reason. Medication is really all about the benefits being higher than the risks. My very personal opinion, is if you’re going to taper off and see how you feel, do it slowly, lowering it a dose once a week at a minimum, and do it when you don’t have too many responsibilities or risks if you do get a little worse. But if you felt the same benefits at a low dose than a high dose, maybe a low dose might work a little better for you. But it depends how long you’ve been on it and on the increased dose.

AskDocs,fpqecrj,t3_gey44g,1588820893.0,"Honestly it’s probably the depression and the lack of quality sleep at night. I would maybe try something to help reset your sleep schedule. You can either take melatonin and then immediately go outside in the sunlight when you wake up if possible or at least turn on all your lights. You can also do the thing where you stay up for 36 hours and then most people will get a good nights sleep after that. With either of these, also have a big breakfast, drink a full glass of cool water, and/or exercise when you wake up which tells your body that that’s the time to be awake and will help kick start your day. I suffer from PTSD and depression and i’m tired and dissociating basically all the time, and unisom is the best thing to help me get a good nights sleep but makes me very groggy the next day, but i’ve been finding some success stepping outside every little bit to get some sun and let it wake me up. Try and keep curtains uncovered. Do a couple jumping jacks every few hours."

relationship_advice,fplvv8t,t3_ge8dae,1588720470.0,"he has some self esteem issues, seems like there’s a bigger problem on his end. Masturbating more often can SOMETIMES make them last longer, so maybe if you guys wanna have sex he could masturbate a bit before. I feel like there’s a lot of options that he could be doing, like foreplay and making you cum first and then having sex and then he can finish. Like there’s a lot of options you guys can do if he’s insecure, so i would try and sit down and talk to him about his insecurities and say either we need to have sex more often or i should be able to masturbate, cause that’s not really fair if he can masturbate but he gets mad when you want to? That doesn’t seem healthy. And just tell him you miss your sex life and you want to be able to have sex with him regularly again. With me and my SO, sometimes neither of us finish but we like to do it because we get to just spend time with each other and be really close. A lot of time he’ll eat me out so i cum and then we have sex and he cums and it works out really well so i recommend that. But yeah what he’s doing right now isn’t healthy and isn’t fair for you, so i would tell him that."

relationship_advice,fplt903,t3_ge7u4m,1588719030.0,"Here’s my take: I think you should wait a little bit to tell her, after you two get to know each other a little better. You’ll probably have to open up to her about it when she tries to have sex. As someone who’s had trauma and a lot of issues having sex, i definitely understand, and it’s gotten easier to manage as i deal with my trauma and am in a long term relationship. So when the time comes just make sure she knows it’s not personal, you just have a lot of things in your past that you have to deal with and it’s something you’ve never been able to do. But if you’re comfortable with it, you guys could do more things just focused on her, you can eat her out and finger her or whatever, and if she really wants a dick maybe you guys can invest in a dildo. And maybe in the process of her orgasming, maybe you will without having to touch yourself at all. This is something that is probably going to come a lot later if the relationship continues. But i think it’s probably your best bet with a compromise, and a good place to start. I would try your best to get to know her first, and maybe just let out small information slowly, tidbits at a time if she really pushes. I’m sure she’ll understand if at first you just tell her “hey i have some trauma and a lot of bad things have happened to me, so sex is really difficult for me”. This is what i had to tell my boyfriend and he was really understanding and we really eased into it and found things that work. It’s not unusual for people to have sex without having traditional PIV sex, and other methods are usually a lot better for the female anyway. But really it’s ALL about what you’re comfortable with, don’t push yourself too far, and be patient with yourself. Look into therapy for your trauma. If anything else, I’m sure you guys could be really good friends if the romantic relationship doesn’t work out. I just really hope for you that she is a really nice girl that will be understanding. If she isn’t understanding, if she doesn’t validate what’s happened to you, if all she wants is sex, and whatever else, she probably isn’t someone you want to be with anyway. Lots of people can have successful relationships without having sex at all, so it’s all about finding a good compassionate person that works with you. Best of luck my friend."

relationship_advice,fpjebs0,t3_gdt697,1588665391.0,"I was a 15 year old and an 18 year old was super abusive and controlling and he groomed me and gaslighted me and manipulated me into losing my virginity to him when i really didn’t want to but he shamed me into it. After that i was just a sex object to him. I don’t think 15 year olds are ever mature enough to be in a relationship with any adult. Especially 22. There’s a lot of growth and maturing that happens when you reach 18 and become an adult, and I don’t think a 15 year old should be with someone that old, because guys that old that want to be with girls that young have some issues, and most likely just want to have a sense of control and they will most likely manipulate them with the fabrication of “true love” when 15 year olds have no idea what that is and it’s definitely not being manipulated by a full ass adult and being coerced into sex way too young. 15 year olds don’t have even close to that sort of maturity to be with a 22 year old, and any guy that is 22 and going after high school girls, I want nothing to do with him and he is a sexual predator"

relationship_advice,fpfmiy0,t3_gd6mck,1588575941.0,"My fiancé (us also 20 and 22) doesn’t watch porn anymore because he looks at my nudes i’ve sent him in the past. Maybe try working something out like that, where he masturbates to your nudes and maybe videos or something. Or maybe see if he can try different types of porn, like the only porn i ever use is reading it. I don’t know too much about masturbation (never done it and can’t bc trauma), but this is what my fiancé does and it works well for him. Maybe see if he can masturbate with you involved and maybe when he’s in the mood for it you guys can try and have sex in those moments. Other than that, maybe a therapist would be able to help him more. 
As for insecurities, i don’t think it’s about how anyone looks, idk what he is into, but usually it’s just the fact you can watch sex in action. The girls on there are very fake and all of it is really unrealistic, my fiancé always tells me he likes my body more than the fake ones. So more than anything, i would just keep open communication with him and see how he can reassure you, just let him know how insecure it’s making you and come up with a plan to help, even if that’s therapy for him. And maybe in the mean time you can try masturbating more too, which could help your sex drive and your self confidence."
