A lot of people are asking about my necklace, so my boyfriend gave me the heart one, he gave it to me on our 1 year anniversary and I never ever take it off. It‚Äôs so amazing and perfect because blue is my favorite color and it has a rose on it which is my favorite flower. The lock one doesn‚Äôt mean much at all, I found it online and just thought it was a neat necklace almost edgy? Idk was just trying to be fashionable! I believe the heart is from Amazon? I could be wrong.  

I am totally floating because of all your kind words. To any one who said I inspired them I just want to take the time to say how meaningful that is to me. 

It‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôll be taking WAY more pictures now. My confidence is soaring. I have extremely bad anxiety and depression, and some days/most it would most definitely get the best of me, but yesterday I felt good, and decided to share that to you random redditors and I honestly couldn‚Äôt stop smiling, and I‚Äôm still not smiling! I love you all! Have an amazing day üíìüíì"
