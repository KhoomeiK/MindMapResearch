Would be awesome to see her go around hunting inquisitors and irking Palpatine and then eventually going after Luke's New Jedi Order. Becoming an enemy of all.

I started growing the idea I wrote in answer and realized that the most logical would be that she founds a dark order trying to find knowledge overall, she still sees the sith as too dogmatic in believing themselves superior and the Jedi too narrow, also obviously having a vendetta with them. 

Her ambitions will grow as she builds her own order and it all will lead to conflict."
StarWars,fr2kts9,t1_fr2is9a,1589839052.0,"I want to avoid sounding like the people you fear but I also want to try and give an answer and it probably won't be to your liking.

Its alright. I as an individual do value representation and its worth for people, when most characters basically since the inventions of movies have almost always been white male. It makes sense that groups of people want to at least have some characters to represent them, not because they are that but because they are human. We want to see characters on the screen that can tell us that this could be us sort of. It is not only people of minorities that feel like this, in a sense if you look at the backslash for Finn and Rey a lot of it seems to steam from just white men not feeling that they can identify with them because they are not white men.

But in the end representation doesn't matter unless it is done in a well written way. The character shouldn't be defined by that trait, but having that character be a woman, poc or whatever, however it helps a lot of people to be able to relate to characters and it doesn't even have to be due to race or gender but can be due to personality and so much more. We can create heroes and villains that people love but let more people get to have someone like them on the screen.

People are asking for representation because they rarely get positive representation in media it isn't meant to be a demand, more just a request. White men have for the most gotten characters to identify without having to ask.

Lets just have a hypothetical, in a society were women were the priveleged group and most movies were made by white/black women with white/black women in mind, men would want representation in the same way.

This is not saying that we shouldn't have white men. Nor that we should force it in but I don't see the inherent wrong in wishing that there were characters that were of a certain gender or race. In the end the importance is that they are well written. However writers should be encouraged to try and create characters that aren't the same old, we should try and let as many characters exist of as many possible definitions as long as it fits inside the universe. Star Wars have canon humans of all race and gender, they don't need to be associated with real world cultures but the characters should reflect that human can and look different.

I feel like the idea of forced inclusiviety or calling for it is hard, especially considering that there is a neutral and because everyone besides white men are considered the ""other"", everytime they get a spot its easy to see people talk about it like its being forced, even if the writer wanted the character to have a certain appearance culture. The reason that I feel people think its forced is that it differs.

But honestly my main request for this is that I want more characters that don't fit the cliches. I want characters that are new and different. Maybe its selfish but we have hundreds of great male villains, I just wish we could have a female villain sometime that was equally badass. In a universe like Star Wars were there already are so many characters it would be nice to add because it will give the character a difference.

In the end however it comes down to good writing, and I think people would care for something new and nuanced. Yet ultimately my desire to have a good female villain isn't just because of representation or calling but because of the fact that there is none. I think that is the important part of it all, I want them to explore new avenues. To go against norms and try things that make the cast of characters you can love be more varied. It would also allow writers to try new things that they haven't done before.

I don't think anyone will read this from Disney and be like ""yeah we should do this"". Its not a demand that I want this to be a thing. Its just a dream I decided to share that would be nice if it happened.

Sorry if I made you realize I am like the people you distrust or act sarcastic towards. But hopefully I make some sense. :)

Addendum: I still want people that don't share my skin or gender to have characters they can look up too. I can still love characters even if they aren't the same as me and identify with them. I don't see it as limiting and even if the group in question calls for it, why shouldn't writers be allowed to try out new things?"
StarWars,fr2httl,t1_fr2bh3g,1589837536.0,"I do not really understand why she would want to destroy the force, I agree that it is an interesting character but it feels more like the set up for a anti hero than a villain I guess. Don't get me wrong that would also be appreciated.

Your concepts sound great though! They would make for a good story I think. I like the idea of having another Jedi in love and how to deal with that, especially the killing her Master thing out of anger yet not becoming an inquisitor or going against the order.

I guess what I was thinking was more a Sidious like villain or Vader like that is a major threat. So my concept would be more like the following: 

For example I guess if we jump forward a few centuries, lets say Rey's Jedi Order is well established and there are many Jedi. The order would be considered more Grey as it is not too strict as the Old ones but there is a Jedi who is ambitious, she wants to create a better world from order. The current regime is still decentralized in a sense and she starts studying the old Empire. 

When her best friend and fellow apprentice falls ill, she refuses to let go. He friend has a family and children who would become the protagonists later. The woman finds her way into the archives and studies everything, finding mentions of Darth Plagueis somehow preserved. Trying to find out more about the sith teachings in saving life she continues down that path. Presenting ideas to the council, trying to get approval to let her study it more. They of course refuse fearing she will fall and her friend ultimately succumbs to her illness, breaking her heart in guilt and anger at the Order for not doing enough. 

Eventually she finds herself falling more and more into the Sith teachings after her friends death. The new Jedi Order do allow limited study of Sith texts to try and prevent the outright ban. It did have limits as too how much they could be studied at a time to avoid indulging in it. She finds herself more and more compelled to continue this, but ultimately she is found out and put on trial. She is exiled from the order after refusing to give up the practice.

 Her hatred for the council grows as becomes a passion project to create a perfect society and a new order not constrained by the Jedi's morality.  She starts on a world currently in a civil war, gathering a following as a strong force wielder cutting down the opposition and starts her reforms. Bringing any force sensitive youths to train them to become members of her order. When the Jedi Order learns about this they ultimately send an army of Jedi alongside the government to hunt her down and stop this before it becomes a threat, she is chased off the world. Losing an eye and an arm in the battle. She is presumed dead but flees to the Outer Rim/Unknown Regions. Gradually taking in apprentices with the few loyalist she have left. 

The story could then follow her return, trying to take revenge against the order as the children of her best friend now Jedi will rise up to stop her. Or something like that."

Even though if the creator does make that choice I will see people rushing to say they ""forced it in"", something male villains rarely have to deal with because they are always considered the neutral.

I just hope that some writer will take inspiration to do this in a good way and shouldn't bar themselves from doing it. Like the question of Rey, I don't think it was forced to have her as the main character, even though it might have been a point that they wanted to have a female main character as all the previous once had been male, the main issue is primarily how she was written. What I mean to say that as much as it shouldn't be forced, it should also not be avoided because people might perceive it as forced regardless what the writer thought. If I make sense."
StarWars,fr21qkj,t1_fr2141q,1589829657.0,"I mean of course good writing is the most important part but in my opinion it is fun to see more characters that aren't exactly the same as previous ones. For example I also want more alien main characters, prefeably not Disneys brown flat faced snout aliens.

I just think representation matters of both real and fictional identetities, it gives the universe more a feeling of being alive but also shows that characters that aren't just male humans like Dooku, Vader, Sidious and Kylo can be evil characters. It gives more diversity in the cast of characters that makes the universe feel more alive overall. I mean despite being a galaxy far far away, most main characters are always human when there is a plethora of species to choose from. That is in my opinion a loss of a lot of potential, there is this big universe and you limit yourself artificially to just one species."

Its understandable that she had issues between Kylo and Luke as she didnt truly know either of them. I think however that a core tenent should be that she always tries to do the right thing regardless if it fails or not.

She should have had more training in TLJ + actually built her own light saber (double bladed). I feel like the Palpatine twist could work but it should have been revealed in TLJ and it would explain her more raw force powers.

She should have been a character built around raw force usage which due to lack of training could hurt her friends. I would have loved if Finn also trained as a Jedi and she represented the force and he the lightsabers.

She shouldn't have been a good pilot, never having touched controls but a mechanic. I also think force healing etc shouldn't have been something she could use.

I still like the dyad thing but the romance needs to go with the Reylo. Probably have her doubting herself and at one point rescuing Finn and him rescuing her. Show that teamwork is necessary to wind and she isnt an unstoppable force.

I also enjoyed the duel of the fates narrative where she was blinded in her fight with Kylo. Maybe have her at least lose one eye or limb to show that she is not immortal and avoid the trope that women are unscarred."

But I realize that a way to salvage it would have been to use the above. They should have tried to create their own path. Have Rey and Kylo fight with broken down equipment a decade old cause. It should have been about moving on, letting the past die as Kylo said. Symbolize the fading of the old. Both the First Order and New Republic tried to emulate the past. A better way to end it would have been that they found a new way made by themselves and not trying to emulate the past.

Personally I would also alternatively have loved the Duel of Fates version of IX. Idk I don't like how the sequels felt like just OT again and more.

I am honestly not against Palpatine coming back but I wish they had done something more with that.

What could have been a stunning ending would have been to have Kylo and Rey reject both Luke and Sheev. A Skywalker and Palpatine would lay down arms and create a new order not fearing the dark side but pursuing balance. It would have also made the whole dark side Skywalker light side Palpatine theme have more meaning.

**What character(s) are you happiest with the growth of? This can be anyone**.

I do enjoy Faye's Character development a lot. Especially the old stuff about the father issues but also just coping with alcohol and going away from it considering this series has a trend of MC's usually getting drunk.

**What character(s) are you the most disappointed with the growth of?**

I think Dora needed some more time to deal with her control issues, or at least something about that comes up before the wedding. I feel like it was glossed over.

Also Marigold and Amir + their relationship.

**What characters do you miss the most?**

Whilst I think Steve should have had more time. I would like to see some of the older characters like Angus and Penelope.

**Which characters are you happy to say ""good-riddance"" to?**

Whilst I am fine with most characters and don't really care, I think Melon and her robo friend and the Professor Robot hasn't added a lot. I would honestly don't mind if they cut Yay Newfriend...

**How do you feel about Marten no longer really being the main character?**

I always saw QC having started late as a story of several characters, Marten was more pronounced in the beginning but it makes sense that the story would branch out more. I would like to see more issues surrounding his passivity, however I don't think as many here that Claire as a person is the issue. I however think he should deal with that.

**Do you believe the current comic lacks real problems now? Ex.: Faye's alcholism, relationships, jobs, struggles.**

I mean I like the May story arch and the alcoholism is interesting but there hasn't been any mayor conflicts as of late. However in the past there were long periods without serious drama as well from what I remember of reading so hopefully it will have something soon.

**What sets or locations do you miss the most (like coffee of doom, Marten/Faye's house)?**

Coffee of Doom would be nice to see more of, I think Marten/Faye's house would also be nice.

**Do you think the comic has shifted characters and has essentially moved on to a phase 2 Sci-Fi plot?**

I agree with many here that there is a super big focus on robots right now. And in universe three years from pintsize robos to androids seems like a huge leap now that I think of it. However May and Roko are still interesting characters. I would prefer a more limited focus on robots.

**If the above question were true, how do you feel about this? Are you a fan of the shift to a new comic?**

I don't mind the shift, I started fairly late and I am just happy to see things grow.

**Does QC still make you happy to read every week?**

Eventually the robot would drift into its own person but starts out thinking it is you. For example just realizing there is two of ""you"" would make both realize that they are seperate."
falloutlore,foht9yb,t1_fo7m2l9,1587772216.0,"The problem is for example if you transfer one copy of you onto a robot shell that has everything the same. The moment that transfer ends both become different individuals. Every reaction from there on out is not necessarily the same. The original will most likely only still perceive their biological body, not the robot one. So you will still die but the copy of you will live on."
theouterworlds,fogvauz,t1_foga72k,1587757374.0,Hallo :)
theouterworlds,fofrmof,t1_fofr4v4,1587741596.0,Kronor which is the swedish currency. Crowns in English
theouterworlds,fofnz4a,t1_foff3m4,1587739706.0,Outer Worlds is still an AA game with less resources and time available but yes you are right. Quantity wise 76 beats it.
theouterworlds,fofnvfv,t1_fofg8tc,1587739650.0,I disagree in regards to writing. At release FO76 was barebones. But I like and return to both. Outer Worlds scratches that story itch for me more. I mean you like your stuff. People here like theirs. Let it be.
theouterworlds,fofn3vn,t1_fofmup4,1587739235.0,I am not really into the whole comparing thing but as a fallout esque game it is more in my taste than Bethesdas. I just found it funny that it and New Vegas showed up when googling Fallout 5.
theouterworlds,fofm0w5,t1_foflxsk,1587738654.0,Hello :)
theouterworlds,fof7qi8,t3_ds598a,1587728844.0,New Gary situation.
theouterworlds,fof3iut,t1_fof14tm,1587724722.0,Oh I agree. I dislike Bethesdas way of handling things overall. I just found this funny.
Starfield,foezvg8,t3_g3lmok,1587720806.0,I would like at most 2-3 planets with smaller asteroids/stations to avoid risking it being bland and dead. I could see the story taking place in one solar system.
fo4,foa9x3o,t3_g62584,1587642815.0,"I thought it was going to lunge at you. It was being excited by you approaching it God. What if there was an actual enemy like that in FO4. You killed it and thought it was dead but you notice the body just lurking around, potentailly killing you."
PrequelMemes,foa78j5,t3_g6j272,1587641326.0,Now we just need one where their lightsabers also multiply. Eternal arms race
wow,fo7jul4,t1_fo7jkjx,1587579563.0,My sexuality doesn't have anything to do with it. Although I prefer to avoid homophobic jokes. It is more about presentation and not having to worry that the people you play with will become hostile the moment they learn that part of you.
wow,fo7jqt7,t1_fo7jd53,1587579511.0,"Its more if it ever comes to voice chat and stuff like that. I am quite self concious about my voice and overall its more for my own mental health to not have to be paranoid about being called out about it if its revealed. 

For me its not really about sexuality, albeit I dislike homophobic jokes etc. Its more that I am trans."
falloutlore,fo76ntq,t1_fo4sxk2,1587573169.0,I think they said Fusion was invented very late. Possibly even during the Sino-American war. That might be why China never invented it before the nuclear war.
falloutlore,fo76f1l,t1_fo769s9,1587573050.0,I remember reading that the Prydwen was using the stolen nuclear reactor from Rivet City. I am wondering if the loss might cause the Capitol Wasteland to overthrow the BoS
commandandconquer,fo70owh,t1_fo6o0zv,1587570180.0,"Yeah they are referred in the original design documents. EA didn't actually invent the Scrin, they were always meant to be the origin of tiberium and introduced in even the original CNC3"
AreTheStraightsOK,fo6tbtn,t3_g5el7b,1587566338.0,I have never seen anything like this before and I am not sure if I get it. Is this person actually having a BF that is acting like that? Wtf?
imgoingtohellforthis2,fo6t1lm,t1_fo516d8,1587566182.0,You are pathetic.
imgoingtohellforthis2,fo6sls0,t1_fo4w2w9,1587565934.0,"Yeah your kid would be right to hate you, you would be doing them a favour. Hopefully you'll never have a child."
AreTheStraightsOK,fo6rrlx,t1_fo6ost9,1587565468.0,I want to know too
Xcom,fo6ghmh,t3_g5gszl,1587558139.0,Goddamn Weebs
AreTheStraightsOK,fo6ft3x,t3_g5re5e,1587557588.0,"I really wanna read the comments just because I know they will be disgusting. But I will end up feeling suicidal most likely.

Fuck transphobes and fuck people like this, why the fuck do they think this is alright?"
commandandconquer,fo4ya0p,t1_fo4y85z,1587513597.0,The tiberium universe would make great material for that.
worldbuilding,fo2j3mm,t3_g57gpm,1587464359.0,I was looking forward to more on this and this is still the same equally intriguing and super creepy thing as the other ones you did! Keep up the amazing work!
TwoXChromosomes,fo0mnlo,t1_fo090oy,1587415866.0,"The same people who would probably be ""muh free speech"" when hating on lgbtqi+ people and then first to ban when doesnt fit their view."
stevenuniverse,fo0kxbo,t1_fnzi5sj,1587414989.0,"Parry, Parry BANG BANG*"
gorillaz,fnzj9xo,t3_g4rzif,1587395145.0,First canon image of Phase 8 confirmed. 2D is now more pants than human.
RWBY,fnx0b45,t1_fnwyadj,1587328974.0,"I agree that letting him take over the White Fang without big opposition and the way it was portrayed in V5 felt like their threat was downgraded. Vol 1-3 indicated that the White Fang had chapters for each Kingdom and it mainly Vales faction that was ultimately under Adams command.

I think those points were problematic but I don't see a problem with his V3 and V6 activity. :)

I wonder if the mistral arc was rushed. But it might also be that the Kingdoms started cracking down harder than before on White Fang activity but I wish that had been brought up."
worldnews,fntbdc5,t1_fntaouu,1587238275.0,Sorry if I misunderstood but what do you mean?
worldnews,fnt9beh,t3_g3opk6,1587237115.0,American Big Corps and the culture of anti unionization baffles me. But then its not like they care about their employees.....
transgender,fnrrvmx,t1_fnr49ie,1587199218.0,Yeah it shouldnt do that. It should just increase pressures. For them to change. I overreacted. Good luck with your studies!!
Fallout,fnqnwwi,t1_fnpej1h,1587168421.0,I think its a scummy practice to squeeze more money out of the players. The game is a lot better now and I have trouble putting it down. I mean though my economy is not the best but I wouldn't say its worth it.
transgender,fno1vl2,t3_g2re3q,1587109049.0,I doubt we will see the EU throw out Hungary... But God I hate the nations government....
Fallout,fnmqica,t1_fnmjv9g,1587076235.0,I was massacred by one guy as I had a public Workshop. But usually people stay away. I think its worth it.
Fallout,fnmqbd9,t3_g1zrrw,1587076134.0,Got a free copy on Steam despite refunding. Probably due to preorder and I hate to say it but I agree. I still think Bethesda has been acting scummy but this was a step in the right direction.
