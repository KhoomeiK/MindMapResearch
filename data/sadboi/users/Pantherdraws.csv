(Also, speaking of Hebrew... again on the Sangheili side, there's Mahkee 'Chava - ""Chava"" being a Hebrew name meaning ""life."")

On a purely meta level, it's likely just the authors going ""wow, cool name!"" and running with it. In-universe it can probably be explained by xenolinguistics specialists looking for social/historical/cultural parallels when translating things that don't necessarily have a straight nonhuman-to-human language translation.

That's something that *real life* translators often have to do, because most languages just can't be translated word-for-word. There are complexities and layers of meaning that have to be worked around and figures of speech that only exist in one language and letters and sounds (like glottal stops, for example) that non-native speakers can't really manage well, and all these things *and more* have to be taken into account when translating, and sometimes you just have to guess at things. And that's all just between *contemporary human languages* - alien languages (especially languages like the Jiralhanae's, which heavily incorporate sounds we wouldn't consider ""words,"" like growls and roars) would no doubt be considerably trickier.

...sorry, I went off on a bit of a tangent there lmao :')

TL;DR Translation is finicky, messy, and relies on a lot of guesswork."
HaloStory,fmpbczk,t3_fwmbxn,1586277820.0,"To be fair, you do run into that issue with the Sangheili, too.

For example, Rtas '*Vadum*, the Shipmaster of *Shadow of Intent* \- ""vadum"" is Latin for "" shallow place, stream; ford, shoal; channel"" (his home Keep was on the shore, for context.)

So I think it's definitely a matter of [Translation Convention](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention) at work."

HaloStory,fmmhep7,t1_fmm53ll,1586205311.0,"As far as I can tell, one (or both) of two things is happening here:

a.) You're thinking of BLADEMASTERS, who are SO Elite that they are *literally banned from marrying* and are instead allowed to bed any female they please in the name of furthering their ""superior"" genes

and/or

b.) You're looking at THEL 'VADAM, Kaidon of the nation-state OF Vadam and basically *royalty*... and deciding that, because this guy who is all but a KING has multiple wives, then virtually *every* Sangheili male has multiple wives. Which is kind of a huge leap of logic and absolutely not supported by any lore that I'm aware of (I mean, we have MULTIPLE NAMED husband/wife pairs throughout the EU, and never once is it implied that they're ""not REALLY married"" or polygamous or w/e. Meanwhile, we have exactly TWO named males with *multiple* partners, and they're both extreme outliers rather than ""common men"" - Toha 'Sumai, the Blademaster who was Usze 'Taham's father, and Thel 'Vadam, whose mysterious wives are obliquely referenced once in a 12-year-old book and then never again.)"

Out of all of the ones you named, Thel 'Vadam and Rtas 'Vadum (the Shipmaster of the *Shadow of Intent*) probably come closest - Rtas in particular, given that he bested his second-in-command Bero 'Kusovai *at least* once in a practice duel."
