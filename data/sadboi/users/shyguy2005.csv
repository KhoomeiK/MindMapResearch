I've been single for way too long and feel like there's no hope in finding someone who can love me. I know that sounds lame and I'll probably get shit about it because guys are just supposed to be able to get laid all the time whenever they want. That's kind of difficult when you hate yourself and have zero self esteem. I just want to not exist. I don't necessarily kill myself, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up to this pathetic life."
