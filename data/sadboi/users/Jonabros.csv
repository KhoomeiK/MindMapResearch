And since Karma and WondaMike seem to get along really well, I wouldn't be surprised if this CLT team (if they stick with WondaMike) continues to be a top competitor in the Rival Series next season üëçüèº

I also think that Rogue is making a great move bringing Turinturo in, the guy was one of the very best players in RLRS for two seasons straight and definitely makes this team a playoff/top half contender. They have one experienced icon and two young speedy talents.. This is Rogue's time to really make a push towards the North American elite."

If a team has 10 or less tournament results, every result up until then will show up, but teams like C9 and G2 have played in a lot of seasons/tournaments, so only their most notable results will show in the achievements tab on the team's main page.

C9 has placed top four/top two in way more tournaments (they have also won more trophies) so you will see those results in their achievements tab. G2 hasn't had equal as much deep tournament runs, that's why their RLCS Season 8 run is still one of their 10 most notable results."
