Like if you're In a grocery store you're not gonna buy the box of fruit snacks that are already open. You push it to the side and get a better box. Thinking of it like this helps me understand why people have a tendency to avoid or ignore me. It's okay I guess, it just means I don't have to waste what energy I have on people who basically see me as less than human. Not that anyone actually puts any effort in to talk to me. So I don't put any effort into socializing either. My family ignores me in the same way. Even if I did want to talk or open up to someone, I wouldn't exactly know how. I have like 0 social skills. 0 self esteem. My family leaves me to myself, like you're better seen than heard. Like I'm only kept around to make everyone else feel better about themselves. My sister was just married and is expecting first child. My younger brother is about to get married and is also expecting his first child. I'm the oldest. And already hailed as the greatest failure in the family. I'm positive the only reason I haven't been kicked out on my ass is because my mom knows I would kill myself...to love an be loved, is that really to much to ask for?"

It wasn't until I was like 25 to realize it. The neglect was almost unnoticeable, because of the constant fear of being whipped with a belt or paddle. I just did my best to stay quiet and out of sight. I kept the same mentality into my adulthood, and it really fucked me up.  I'm a barely functioning adult. Never learned how to be one. I'm so socially awkward, that I don't put in an effort to meet or talk to people. I try talking to women here and there, but they don't see past the surface. No one wants a broken man as a boyfriend or husband. I guess I can understand that. I think actual love, would bring me up to levels of happiness I never experienced before. At the same time I don't know if I could love, because I don't know how to reciprocate it, so it's awkward or weird. You should talk about it more with her.
