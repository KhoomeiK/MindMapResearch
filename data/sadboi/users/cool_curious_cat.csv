BPD,ffejfx3,t3_et2e3b,1579850504.0,"100% to 0% to 100% is the mathematics of bpd.  It's a dialectic, or extreme opposites.  Landing on one or the other depends on my mood and/or if I'm splitting. When I split and hate everyone, it goes to zero. Also, if having empathy conflicts with getting my needs met with attention, then my mind has no interest in empathy for others.  I need my emotional CPU to focus on my own suffering while I ride out the waves of negative emotions. If someone wants to say that's being a piece of shit, then so be it."

Do you mind reworking your request using DEAR MAN format and posting it here?
