I told him that while it sucks, the fact that the country is willing to call this terrorism is further proof that the lack of safety we feel isnt blown out of proportion.

tifu,fr6681l,t3_gmhtel,1589920623.0,"As a female, I feel the need to reassure you that honestly, dick size isn’t as important as you would think. My understanding is the average dude‘s penis probably measures no more than 6 inches or so, and for good reason because when a woman is fully aroused we can only comfortably fit about 6 inches up in ourselves so if I had to choose I would much rather have an average size dick if not even a little bit smaller because tbh it is just more comfortable for sex. My boyfriend is average if not a little girthier and I have made the mistake of having sexy times before my body was fully ready and he’s hit my cervix before by accident and let me tell you, shit hurts really bad. I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to actually have a 9 inch dick and have to constantly  worry about trying not to push too much of your length in there so as not to hurt her. The way I look at it, evolution must have known what it was doing when it gave a man no more than a 6 inch dick as an average and a woman no more than 6 inches worth of space in her body to accommodate it when she’s aroused.

I hope that maybe that helps you see penis size a little differently and not be insecure about it. Dick measuring contests are something I never understood between dudes, and I think unfortunately it’s not unusual for men to exaggerate the length of their dick by an inch or two and suddenly a 5 inch sick becomes a 7 inch dick and then women start thinking 7 inches is the norm and because we’re not taking a ruler to every cock we see we just say okay and go with it. (I mean I couldn’t tell you the exact size of a penis just by looking at it that’s for sure.) It’s a self perpetuating cycle that leads to a lot of male insecurity that doesn’t need to be there imho."

AskWomen,fq6numl,t3_ggnj46,1589135127.0,"For me personally its a mixture of things. First and foremost you don't go in looking for a relationship to complete you, because you're setting yourself up for failure from day one. Second, maintain your own opinions, hobbies and friends outside of whatever shared interests you have - while shared experiences and activities are vital to a relationship, separate ones help make you and your partner healthier and honestly I like the difference of character it makes my life more exciting and exposes me to different things. And having a list of dealbreakers and not being afraid to adhere to them. I'm pretty much flexible on all things but I have some things that are absolutely a no-go and I will end the relationship over them. (Mainly controlling or abusive actions and stuff like that.)

My partner and I have been with each other for going on 9 years and we have a bit of an unconventional history. We met long distance when we were 20 (we lived in different countries) and were long distance until 2017 where I moved to be with him and I've been with him ever since. I was young and made stupid decisions like everyone but me being LDR really helped me learn how to ve independent outside of a relationship before moving to be with my partner. I'm really happy to have finally closed the distance and I have zero regrets for moving, but I also made care not to have him be the center of my world when I moved because it's easy to do when you move for a relationship. I was pretty quick to look for other friends and activities outside of my relationship with him to keep things more rounded. He's a great man, never bashes my hobbies or aspirations and whenever I say I want to do something he always says, ""Go for it."" He supports me as an individual and that does wonders for my mental health and we're better off for it. We have our ups and downs like any couple but I wouldn't trade him for the world because he accepts me as I am and it makes me want to be a better person for myself, not for who he wants me to be!"

I am a very irregular user, no more than 7 days out of the month MAX (usually more like 3-4) so YMMV, but part of the reason I am so irregular is because personally, I found when I started to make it a more regular habit my mental health decreased and anxiety increased pretty significantly.

Partner does most of the shopping and stuff since he's laid off.) 

To top it off, my job is very stressful, and without that strict divide between my work and home life, I find my anxiety and depression a lot higher than it's been in a VERY long time. It's tough when most of your hobbies deal with your computer, and yet now you're stuck on your computer for 8 hours a day building up a lot of stress - takes what used to be an area of relaxation and taints it with bad juju, so to speak and now I want nothing to do with my computer once my shift is done.

CanadaCoronavirus,flc8awx,t1_flc7hwd,1585022565.0,"I don't disagree with ya, I guess my driving point is there are a lot of employers who will take advantage of a vague description to do everything within their power to keep a business open, because some businesses are in denial like that and prioritize profit over the employee's health, which means more likelihood to get sick and that puts everyone else at risk too.

I can't completely knock my employer because they are letting most of us work from home and those who need to stay in the branches to take packages and load trucks in the warehouse, they've dropped hours so they can lessen staff, which means less bodies to contaminate. The issue is, they are so determined to stay open that their game plan is: ""Well if any of our branch staff get sick, we will get the place profesionally sanitized and bring in the work from home folk since they will have been healthy due to working from home, and will be able to cover the ones out sick."" Add to this the fact our clients are essentially praising us for helping them stay in business and putting our health at risk, it's not exactly comforting - it's just giving us a chance to get sick too, especially since a lot of us take public transit. We already have 5 staff out sick in my branch, but because they're pretty sure it's not a ""confirmed COVID-19 case and is probably just a normal cold or flu"" they haven't sanitized.

So in the case of my employer, they'll take advantage of a vague description to stay open, no matter the cost. I can make an arguement for pretty much anything on the list, but wish that it would be more precise so employers won't take advantage of technicalities in the description, and keep everyone safer."
CanadaCoronavirus,flc6i73,t1_flc5c6o,1585021184.0,"My job does fall in the category, under: ""Businesses providing mailing, shipping, courier and delivery services, including post offie boxes"" To clarify, our job model is to take small to medium sized business owners packages (think Etsy sellers and the like) across the border into the US to ship from there, since Canada has notoriously high shipping and it saves the little guys the money to be more competitive on their shipping rate.

We have the odd large client, but many of them own store fronts and are taking it upon themselves to close down so we won't be shipping their stuff anyways. Under this mandate, a service like mine would be considered ""essential,"" but I don't think that us helping ship tiny hand-made earrings and artisan enamel pins and your mother's embroidery side-job is really considered an essential service. 

I think the issue is that the list is way too broad, and many jobs that genuinely aren't essential fall into the cracks of how vague some of these listings can be.

Monday morning I woke up with some hecka peculiar symptoms - #1 symptom was joint pain and body aches very similar to a flu, some nausea, my inner ears felt weird (sort of like they do during a cold), I had some mild shortness of breath and a dry cough. I still have these symptoms today, but because they are so mild and I don't have a fever, I'm hesitant on going and getting checked as I heard fever is one of the staple symptoms of COVID-19."

cats,fj8e9xy,t1_fj89a4u,1583111380.0,"Taking your idea, I'm moving myself to the couch when I am on my laptop for things that aren't necessary to be at my desk for. She seems calmer overall when I am anywhere but my desk, so maybe if I put myself on the couch where she can be more at my level she won't feel so anxious. Fingers crossed!"
cats,fj8d165,t1_fj89j20,1583110545.0,"That's a thought! I'll be honest and say that I'm not sure if it would work since I recall once a couple of weeks where my boyfriend was on vacation and I was working and he was staying home with her and giving her a ton of attention and she was soaking it up. But the moment I walked in the door she suddenly acted like she was starved of attention and like my boyfriend had been ignoring her all day. She seems to have a thing about MY attention specifically where she values it over others - it was just her and me for about 5 years before meeting my boyfriend so I guess she's just extra attahed to me. The only time she calms down significantly is when I'm home for a long period of time, such as when I'm on vacation or sick. So I'm wondering if she would be receptive of another person coming to check on her but it's definitely worth a shot, even if for a month!"

My desk is extremely small and I have no way of putting a little bed on it, otherwise I would in a heartbeat. I also have no way to put a cat tree right beside my desk as it is pushed up against two other pieces of furniture, and I have nowhere to move said furniture as our apartment is tiny. I will maybe try and devise some way however!"
cats,fj7xtq6,t1_fj7wxl0,1583100647.0,"Hey, thanks for the great points!

On point # 1 - oddly enough, the morning is typically when my cat is most low-key and not worked up. She gets two feedings closer to each other in the morning than the rest of the day, so it could be she's so food-coma'd that she doesn't have the energy to get all worked up, not sure. She never makes a fuss about me leaving, it's usually when I am back for the day that she gets worked up.

I do try and implement the rest of the points as well, but it's hard to totally ignore her when she's literally climbing all over you to get your attention. I will need to find some way of getting her off my lap/desk/etc doesn't essentially give her the attention she is looking for."
cats,fj7xegl,t1_fj7x1rf,1583100369.0,"I probably should have mentioned it, but we thought about the 'second cat' thing and decided it's probably not a good idea at least at this moment in time. We live in a very small apartment that is probably barely 500 sq ft (it is tall however, so we have implemented shelves for her to climb and she does), and no real way to do a safe introduction between the two as our apartment is open concept and don't have a way of confining one to a bedroom or something like that. I do agree my kitty is probably lonely, and it makes me feel bad, but it's probably not realistically in the cards to do so until we move, which we are hoping to do soon."

Both my partner and I selected ""myself"" and then put each other as a common-law partner and references each other's incomes and etc. I suppose the second one is called a 'coupled return' and helps maximize benefits and the like? We didn't select that option. Hopefully that's acceptable."

Algonquin_College,fivobb3,t1_fivihlk,1582764462.0,"Ugh, that was my fear was bad presentation more than anything - I'm fine with having to do extra legwork to figure a problem out, but not if instructions are poorly written, which I've gotten from a couple of people now. I'm familiar with front-end development myself, but self-teaching beyond that was going pretty slow for me so I wanted to round out my knowledge by going back to school. I do prefer formal learning environments where available precisely because I like the structure to it, so if the structure in this course is really that bad now I'm second guessing it.

As someone who has experience already, do you happen to know of any other online classes that offer programming or software development outside of this as a diploma? It seems everything swings one way or another - either a certificate or a Bachelor's degree, and as I may have a job lined up at my current workplace if I can demonstrate that I can do programming well, it's why I was keen on doing a diploma as I do not feel I need a bachelor's degree and it is somewhat time sensitive."
Algonquin_College,fivh0ax,t1_fiqnnat,1582760135.0,"Thanks for the reply!

This is helpful - it sounds to me like most online courses I've encountered, a lot of having to teach yourself. I'm actually okay with that as I am homeschooled (long story) and essentially had to teach myself, and have done online courses in the past where I had to teach myself as well, so this isn't anything new.

I also feel like being able to Google or read your way out of confusion and into an answer is probably beneficial for a profession like a developer or programmer (I'm familiar with front-end development and am self taught so programming isn't entirely new to me), but I was mostly wondering if the material so far seems to be solid, as I can work with everything else!"
Algonquin_College,fivgl3a,t1_fipegil,1582759919.0,"Hey, thanks for the reply!

I do work full-time, however I am well aware that most tech related fields are extremely demanding so I do plan to drop to part time at my job should I go through with this. Probably down to 25 hours or so - I'd like to go lower if I could, but that's the bare minimum I can go and afford living at the moment.

I didn't realize that the course was so new! I guess with it being so new, it's hard to ask a lot about it but have you heard any feedback from anyone regarding it? I haven't gotten a lot of feedback from others yet (probably because this course is in its infancy), but so far I've heard from people that it's pretty vague and you have to do a lot of teaching yourself."
learnprogramming,fgjdyzi,t1_fgj0a0r,1580842044.0,"I know what you mean. The main issue was that my last class wasn't able to be covered by financial aid because I was taking only one class so fell below half time. I was working full time for $9 an hour when I took that class so I didn't have the funds to pay for it out of pocket to take it and moved before I had the chance to get the funds to finish. I'm a lot better off financially now and the class is offered online, so I might be able to look into doing that. :) The class was a couple thousand if I remember right."
CharacterDevelopment,fg56x5n,t1_fg3mllf,1580519786.0,"Thanks for these answers, I love the one you gave for the 'how are they alive' one! I never thought about a mana element to this whole thing, so it gives me another spin to think about!

The primary reason I chose human out of any other form is because of the fact that in my mind, they aren't inherently a human form, but instead can take the form of sentient creatures on whatever planet they're visiting. Their society has laws and rules like any other civilized, sentient species out there and I figure that there are are intergalactic rules that govern the cosmos and Earth just isn't aware of it, and I'd imagine one of those rules to be something like ""Don't go making yourselves known to those who don't know of your existence because you don't want to go inciting a planet-wide mass panic"" or something along those lines. And I figure he might have broken a law severe enough that he was essentially 'exiled' to life stuck on a planet where he can't take to the cosmos like his kind are meant to do, and because he's a star thing marooned on a planet in a makeshift human body, he suffers a lot of pain and the like because it isn't exactly compatible and the marks on his body are essentially physical manifestations of his status as an outcast (heavily inspired off crop circles). The methodology of how they can change shapes is a whole 'nother store entirely though - I dunno, probably magic or something! /s"

ADHD,fe5cgyp,t1_fe4wwrp,1578867701.0,"Hey, thanks so much for the feedback.

I think ""reactive"" is a good way to describe my job, as there is very little I can do in the way of planning how my work is going to be like throughout the day. (I can't plan how many calls I'm going to get, when I get them and how long they're going to take for example, and the same to can be said about my e-mail tickets to some extent.) I have done actually nearly the exact steps as you in eliminating visual disturbances on my desk, and I only check staff memos and my e-mails at scheduled times each day, otherwise I just ignore them because if I allow myself down that rabbit hole when I don't schedule it, I'll be down there forever and not getting my work done.

A MASSIVE issue with my office is it is actually an addition that was built inside of the warehouse back in 2018. It has a door at either end, so literally the warehouse staff walk right through it, and sometimes stop to idly chat with my coworkers because why not. We also share the office with one other lady who is part of a different department, so a lot of her coworkers come in to talk with her about stuff pertaining to their departmnent. Add all of his on top of the fact that the room is small and we're crammed close to each other, I find I can't really tune out a lot of visual and audio distractions which doesn't help my efforts any.

I think if I could do either just the phones or just the e-mails I could handle my workload a lot better. I find the biggest issue the constant switching of workflow between e-mail and phone calls for sure. Perhaps I will bring it up to my lead as food for thought, as she is aware of my ADHD struggles."

I am from a region of my country which are notoriously called 'flyover states' and no one really blinks an eye at them because there seems to be nothing there. But when you meet the people, you notice how polite they can be and how mindful they are of others. Some say it's superficial, and maybe for some it is, but I really love how friendly and curious everyone is where I come from. We also have the world's best zoo which prides itself in animal conservation which is awesome.

In my current country, I live in a city whose metropolitan area is *significantly* larger than where I grew up. One thing I am most proud about in my current city is how multicultural it is - over half of the people in the city were born from outside of it, and so it means I am surrounded by all different types of accents and languages on a daily basis. It was a bit of a culture shock coming from a region that was notoriously one or two ethnicities, but as someone who moved into the country myself, it has made my transition into life here a lot easier due to their overall acceptance of other cultures."
AskWomen,fde2gn0,t3_ektm7z,1578329684.0,"I think establishing a routine is what helps me feel organized - when I get into a routine, it doesn't feel like a chore to do things and I mentally check them off each day as I do them, which means I don't really keep a list or planner or anything like that. Work is a different story (I use an electronic calendar for that), but that's how I organize my home life anyways. I have ADHD on top of depression and anxiety, so it's easy for me to fall off the bandwagon and for things to spiral out of control a bit, but if you can struggle through maintaining a routine I find it not only helps with organization but the mental health issues too."
