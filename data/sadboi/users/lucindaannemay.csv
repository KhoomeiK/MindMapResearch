SuicideWatch,f9afh2w,t3_e4bb4e,1575201963.0,"It's ok, you are not worthless.  I have never personally met you, but in a way I feel like I understand. What do we do when we are our own worst critics? Personally I always come back to the thought of myself as a child. Her little hands and knees always covered in dirt and scrapes.  I think of her innocent eyes widening at hearing terrible things for the first time.  The joys and sorrows of early life.  When were we taught to hate ourselves?  When did the world break our hearts? When did we grow so afraid and so OK with being afraid... All I can say, is reach down to her,  and comfort her.  You are beautiful, Because you are alive, and life as terrible as it can be, can also be so beautiful. Be there for her, and don't let her think she is worthless, because she cannot be. Impossible."
EatingDisorders,f8hlfzy,t3_drfx5c,1574576420.0,"I've been there, but I pushed through all of the annoying comments and stigmas to reach a healthy and happy weight. I get less attention for my body now,  and less ignorant women telling me how they wish they had my body.  The western society is honestly sick, it wasn't until I started traveling in South America that I realised how people glorify unhealthy body shapes in western culture. Yes,  Colombia does have the second highest plastic surgery in the world, and yes, people are people, and people are superficial and sexual even in South America,  but they glorify fat!!  The bigger you are the better!! And when I experienced that,  I just realised how stupid people are in general and how their opinions don't even matter.  Who cares.  Get fat!!  Get curvey!! Get full!!  And most importantly, get content. You are beautiful no matter what you look like.  Either tell those women the hard facts,  or just stop talking to them.  Move to South America where you can eat as many empanders as you feel and just get sexier."
AWLIAS,f7kk6f3,t3_dueb8r,1573814808.0,I think the point is to learn. What is the best way to learn and grow?  Experience my fellow sentient being. The more life we experience the more we understand about life. Imagine having lived the life of a penguin in the Antarctic? Or maybe the life of Hitler. Imagine what you would understand about the thinking of animals.  Maybe we are actually highly intelligent kangaroos and we wanted to see what it would have been like for homosapiens to evolve instead of kangaroos. To see the world smoke up in flames because of climate change. Maybe this is school.
