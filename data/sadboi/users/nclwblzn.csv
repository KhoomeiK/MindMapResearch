vegetarianrecipes,fbeagex,t3_eckc6j,1576781823.0,"first off, good for you for being such a supportive parent! i personally started pursuing plant based eating by becoming pescatarian when i was around her age and it meant a World of a difference that my mom supported me both through buying groceries that i could make dietarily complete meals/snacks with and defending me against my family members who thought it was all good and harmless to make fun of a literal child for caring about animals/personal health/the environment or whatever the reason. especially my own dad and brothers, so i have a lot of empathy for your situation. that said, some of my favorite veggie meals (some with fish and some without) were:

Rice and Beans- 
it’s a really filling and cheap dish to make,  there’s endless recipes online with all sorts of different spice variations so it never gets old, and the hardest part of making it is knowing how to use a stovetop, so your daughter will likely be able to make it herself after not so long. And this specific combination of plants (rice+bean) forms what is known as a “complete protein,” which is important to take note of, especially if your daughter decides to cut out fish eventually too

Tuna Salad or Chickpea Salad-
the prior is pretty well known and self explanatory, but again there’s a ton of online recipes, and the latter is just boiled (just till softened) chickpeas that you mash and then use as the “tuna” base as you add the mayo, celery, onion, etc to make a fish free “tuna salad” full of protein and tastes pretty close in my opinion. you can pack it in Tupperware with crackers as a snack or put it in a sandwich with cheese and there’s lunch lol

Mac n Cheese-
so obviously this one’s already vegetarian but the boxed stuff we usually resort to is not very nutritious, and a plant based version actually exists that replaces that powdered cheese stuff with a blended sauce made of boiled vegetables (carrots, onions, potatoes) and cashews, if you’d believe it! i found this recipe on youtube and it’s super yum, plus gets in plenty of veggies/nuts in a pasta dish! ( https://youtu.be/ZCK6RZH2fgI )

Salmon Caesar Salad🤤-
the salad is super easy, just mix some caesar salad dressing into some lettuce (romaine has the most vitamins/nutrients as far as lettuce goes, but you can also try other leafy greens if she’s open to spinach, arugula, or kale- all really really good for you) and top with a fillet of grilled salmon (not sure how familiar you are with fish but the fillets are usually available precut at the grocers refrigerated or frozen, and a short sear on each side with a little oil is all that’s required!)
this was my All Time favorite but i already loved fish so if she’s not then maybe wait awhile to pull this one out

snacks are much easier as a lot of plant based eating can be done raw! a couple that come to mind are:

-sliced Bell Peppers and Ranch

-Carrots and Hummus (big protein, great to have in the house when you don’t want to cook)

-Fruit! grapes, blueberries, pomegranates, you know the deal

-Smoothies, a great way to hide the pungent taste of kale/spinach and/or get a lot of fruit down in a less common way (i have a ton of great recipes/combinations but this comment is already getting too long (sorry lol) so i’ll withold them till your request)

-Nuts!! worried about your kid not getting enough protein? nuts and lentils are the way you remedy that, lentils are more of a cooked dish so not really snack-y, but a little container of almonds, cashews, pistachios, etc are a great and nutritious bite to eat. if she thinks nuts are boring, find blue diamond almonds in the grocery store- they come in so many flavors i can’t even tell you, but my favorite is the smokehouse flavor. almost as much flavor variety as chips, and a much better alternative.

i could go on and on but this should be a good start, again thank you so much for being supportive and considerate of your daughters interest in changing lifestyles and i wish you all the best! please feel free to pm me anytime for more advice or just to vent, it can be a struggle but you’re already doing great:) good luck!"

however that talk goes i hope you find what you’re looking for, whether it’s him or not. best of luck!"

you deserve a partner you can trust and will respect you, and after this you must strongly consider whether he can ever be that again (i say this gently because it’s your life and your heart but Every Bone and Muscle in my body is screaming for you to decide that he simply cannot)

i would also strongly recommend therapy, not for anyone else’s sake but your own- get yourself a confidential, trained support system. i swear once you find the right counselor it will make Such a difference in the process of healing from this. please allow yourself to grieve this tragedy, and begin healing through eventual acceptance... sending all my love and support❤️"
