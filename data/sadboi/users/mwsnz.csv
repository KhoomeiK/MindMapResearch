musictheory,fr0jzq4,t3_glydh7,1589798363.0,I've recently stopped playing in structured boxes up and down. I will play the pentatonoc for example focussing on starting and landing on the root note and playing random notes from the scale in between in different positions . I will then try landing on a different interval temporarily before resolving a phrase back to the tonic. I've started to really hear the qualities of the different intervals this way and it helps me learn to apply the scales to the harmonic context in which it sits. Way more enjoyable and productive!

explainlikeimfive,fqptwye,t3_gk7znw,1589553903.0,"A computer program is like driving a car through a busy city. As it runs it makes lots of decisions about what way to go based on what is happening around it, where it just came from and where it is headed next. Most of the time the car knows exactly where it is and exactly where it's going. Sometimes the situation might cause the car to go down a different road, one where it's never been before. Maybe a sign was pointing the wrong way? Maybe he missed his exit? Maybe there was a traffic jam or maybe he misread a street name? All of a sudden the program is lost aimlessly driving about different places but not really knowing where to go. It might drive around in circles, go somewhere it shouldn't, go completely off the map or even crash! Turning our program off puts the car back at the start or in another known location and gives it the chance to try again. If the traffic is just right this time, and all the road signs are in the right places, and the car makes all the right decisions , it should get to where it needs to go."

PersonalFinanceNZ,foj45e6,t1_foj0wv4,1587807639.0,Almost correct. When you purchase the house with the 100k revolving portion that will be sitting at -100k and you will be charged 4.45% interest on it. If you transfer your 100k of savings into that account you won't be charged any interest on that portion. If you only transfered 50k into it then you would be charged interest on the -50k remaining. The key thing is that it starts at the negative amount because that's what you borrowed for the house. Anything put into that portion since will reduce the amount of interest your pay.
PersonalFinanceNZ,foiytdy,t3_g7p12p,1587801766.0,Your offset account will begin in -100k and your will get charged interest on that. As you put more money in that account you will only pay interest on the money owing.
PersonalFinanceNZ,foii1eb,t3_g7lkkb,1587787148.0,"Generally most people will fix their entire mortage to take advantage of the generally lower rates compared to floating. Now, often this is split up so maybe you split your 1 000 000 into 2 fixed portions of 500k each. you might secure the first one for 1 year fixed and the second for 2 years fixed. Why? It might help spread the risk. When your first term comes up for renewal you could re-fix for another 2 years so that each of your fixed portions come up for renewal every year. Because interest rates are low at the moment this could be used to reduce the risk that a spike in interest rates affects you all at once. I think that is the main point of how you structure your mortgage, it is all around your personal risk appetite.

The floating account is used to offset the mortage. Say my first fixed portion expires in a year and I think I can save an extra 20k this year. I might instead structure my 1 000 000 into 2 x 490k fixed portions and 1 x 20k revolving credit portion. You only get charged interest on your revolving credit that is actually in debt, so as you save up your 20k for the year you pay less and less interest on that portion which tends to have the highest interest. The benefit of this is that you still always have access to your ""savings"" at any time if you need it. If you lump-summed all that off your fixed portions you would never have access to that money again.

Now by the time your fixed portion rolls around you might transfer that 20k to pay down the fixed portion, in preparation of saving another 20k next year. Or, maybe you want to keep that portion as an emergency fund, so you increase your revolving credit to 40k but still only 20k in debt now. Now you can achieve the same thing over the following year, offsetting the extra interest as fast as you can. What you do at that point might depend on the interest rates or how much risk you can afford. The revolving credit is a means of paying down as much of your mortgage as you like, while still having access to that money if needed. The banks provide that facility, counting on people not being good savers, and thus earning more interest on that portion. You can use it to your advantage to offset your interest instead though.

Now, the 5% repayment limit only applies to fixed portions. say instead of 20k savings, you managed to save 25k before the year's end. Instead of having your revolving credit in the positives, you may as well lump sum that 5k into your fixed portion prematurely so you're getting charged less interest. Or maybe you invest it in the market instead while mortage interest rates are low? Maybe you want to keep it in cash because coronavirus might put your job at risk? Lots of scenarios that depend on a lot of things so there's no one best way of managing it. The 5% just has more impact as you get to the latter years of your loan. A this point you might have to do more clever management of your fixed portions when they renew, Making a larger portion revolving credit so you can effectively pay down greater than the 5%.

Ultimately there is a lot of flexibility in how you structure your mortgage and it all depends on your personal risk, your savings goals and how fast you want to pay down your debt."
PersonalFinanceNZ,fodrug1,t1_fodjhk3,1587688947.0,I think this is a good strategy. Put it into an offset mortgage account so you get the benefits of less interest charged but ensure you still have emergency funds available. This is what we are working to but still getting there. Are you with ANZ? I think they might have his fee structure? We were just going to wait until each fixed term rolls around to pay down a chunk but will be much easier if we can just transfer extra payments continuously so long as it is still under the 5% per year.

However, I can't understate the value of your personal time and enjoying yourself in and out of the workplace.

newzealand,flmta1y,t3_fpn5v8,1585295710.0,I wish they told people to visualise their nearest park. You can probably go there to walk/run. Anything further you're adding unnecessary risk. There is no one size fits all as every street and suburb in nz is different. If the government gave clear boundaries then people will try push hem rather than staying as close as possible to home. Jacinda has given her intent and we need to work to that.
newzealand,flg5dxr,t1_flg55an,1585131342.0,Thanks. I'm still not sure though based on this article. https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=12319577
AskReddit,flcbada,t3_fnszg7,1585025024.0,Got told to practice our business continuity plan Thursday to get feedback and improve . Jacinda announced the 4-stage response system Saturday.  Stage 3 with effect Monday and now stage 4 full lockdown from tomorrow night for a month. 0 to 100 real quick here in NZ!
orienteering,fkixnsu,t3_filp4e,1584231090.0,"You could look into adventure racing if you're talking point to point and multi-day journeys. Orienteering is usually a multitude of checkpoints and people pick which ones and which order they get them all within a few hours usually. Adventure racing has all checkpoints compulsory and in a fixed order so the element of head-to-head competition is there along with route choice, sleep strategy and getting totally lost sometimes.

I've done [GODZone](https://godzoneadventure.com/) myself and the website there has the previous courses under the history tab. You could follow that and head on over to [NZ Topomaps](http://m.nztopomaps.com/) to correlate the route choice to maps. I can't find the course checkpoint history but if you search ""Godzone race report"" you will get a multitude of stories from competitors about their route choice, pacing, sleep strategy, getting lost, running out of food, finding water etc..

Alternatively you can look up any race on the adventure racing world series calendar and get a number of stories in different environments. The reason I suggest multi-day adventure racing is that there are more stories out there to reference and more course information compared to small single-day orienteering events."

unpopularopinion,feodemo,t3_eq2knz,1579298659.0,I remember going to Oz on a boys trip and stacked up on duty free. Someone got a couple bottles of bundy that no one liked. Last day came and we had a full bottle left. Woke up the homeless guy who was out front of our hotel and gave him a present. We thought he might be offended but he was stoked lol.
