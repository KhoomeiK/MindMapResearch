He’s putting your family and the rest of the people he interacts with at a great risk. Maybe his friends could let him stay there for the foreseeable future ?

I’m 34 f and I look back at my 16 year old self who was also a bit wild and think .. Jesus. Why did I do that? You’ll regret it and it won’t work out. ( that’s for sure ) men who are 10 years older than teenage girls and pursue them are definitely best to be avoided. If I were you i would block / ghost him immediately and confide in a friend / family member that this has happened. Good luck love
relationship_advice,fj0tmqk,t3_fax9yx,1582907497.0,It totally depends on the context. Maybe he was just chatting casually and felt comfortable enough to make it a passing remark.
