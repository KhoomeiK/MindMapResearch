HelloInternet,f889rx1,t1_f87axdt,1574351050.0,"Calories are but a measurement of energy contained in the food, just because you eat as much, does not mean it‚Äôs good for you. Fat first makes it way to protecting the organs (and also is under the skin obviously). I think the challenge is it‚Äôs about weight and not about health. 

I‚Äôve had an eating disorder the majority of my life, in which I learned a lot about the relationship between fat and health. It‚Äôs easy to point to dirt industry, it‚Äôs almost a billion dollar industry, and every diet goes through a phase of being a big deal, there was low fat in the 80‚Äôs, found out that doesn‚Äôt work, then paleo, Atkins, keto, and now plant based diets. This is named ‚Äúyo-yo‚Äù dieting, as people often will keep trying different diet. And I guarantee that you are able to manage you weight for the time being.That does not mean it‚Äôs healthy. In a lot of Linda bacons research (she started as a researcher who was very pro-dieting) but she she made a promise not to accept money from diet culture, giving her unprecedented freedom in her research., the group on the diet loses weight, and is sometimes able to mantain their weight, however after a year or two, all participants regained their weight. While again in the group that did not diet, however changed how they viewed their bodies, their health indicators improved just as much as the diet group. How ever, the non diet group was able to maintain that improvements while the diet group, health indicators got worse.  

There is also ‚Äúthe fuck it diet‚Äù by Caroline Dooner.
I book by someone who has gone on many diets and summarizes a lot of the research in the HAES field. 

Their is also food psych, both a blog and podcast diving into the negatives with diet culture.

There is also body respect, by Linda bacon which really takes a analytical approach to HAES.

Diets also come around to institutionalize racism and sexism. Back in the 1800‚Äôs, folks who are black are disproportionally in a larger body. This was used in culture to describe people who are black as ‚Äúsavages‚Äù as they aren‚Äôt able to adhere to western beauty standards, pointing to their weight as a ‚Äúuncontrollable appetite‚Äù and dieting was seen as an issue of morality. 

Now it‚Äôs used as a means to be pure. To be better then another person."

In fact they are actually more able to survive, because they process food efficiently. People are the size they are, and this focus on being thin is only helping the diet industry make money. 

It‚Äôs more that we are the size we are, fat protects organs, and help keep us warm while also storring. The body does not know the difference between let‚Äôs say the keto diet, and starvation, to the body, it‚Äôs just starvation. There was the Minnesota starvation excitement during ww2, in which they had a study the effects of the subjects being subjected to 1600 calories diet, along with daily exercise, the effects where drastic, damaging, and many of the subjects still faced long term health effects unless they went back to eating what they want when they want it. At first they binged, because again, the body does not know the difference between famine and diets, but I eventually it returned to the previous to before the diet meal plans.

Most of the time when people say that a certain food is more healthy, and their health indicators improve by a diet, that evidence usually correlated on not causation. It could be because of the effects of meditation, getting a moderate amount of exercise. In research done by Linda bacon phd, discovered that while health indicators can improve on people who go on diets, that when you look at the long term effects, is that those people on a diet, would lose weight, and then after a year regain it back making their health worse then before going on the diet. While it participants did not go on a diet, meditated, moderate exercise (2-3x a week)  that their health indicators improved even past those who went on the diet before they regained the weight.
