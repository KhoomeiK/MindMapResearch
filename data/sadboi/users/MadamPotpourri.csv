EatingDisorders,fo4lv64,t3_g59ymb,1587506776.0,"I had no idea what I was doing was disordered until I had time to reflect. 

I exercised obsessively, to the point where when I allowed my one “rest” day per week I’d feel anxiety about it for pretty much the whole day. I calorie counted and if I had so much of a bite of apple I’d write it in my notepad.

This all seemed perfectly reasonable to me until someone pointed out I was getting extremely skinny and I realized it has been months since I’d allowed myself to go out to dinner with friends (for fear of blowing my daily limit.) 

So I don’t personally feel that your mindset going in is the determining factor. It’s more is this attitude and lifestyle bordering into the mentally and physically toxic. It can be very subjective. While some cases are arguably quite obvious and undeniable, there’s gray area where what’s harmful for one is healthful for another."
Adopted,fliscee,t3_foxhjm,1585189543.0,"I am so sorry. 

My dad (adopter) and I are pretty close but my mom and I aren’t. I can absolutely relate to feeling more connected to my mother in law. I’ve been married to my husband for more than 10 years and she is basically my surrogate mom.

It sounds so dumb, straight out of a hallmark card, but it’s true: family is where you find it. 

I call every every single day. Every day. I talk to my mother maybe... once a week when my dad sticks her on the phone with me?

You are a wonderful and valuable person. Just because the people life throw us in a pot with don’t always see if, that doesn’t mean anything. ❤️"
MomForAMinute,ffzuzgp,t1_ffzihka,1580393597.0,"Same. I wouldn’t say that they don’t want love, in my mother’s case anyway, she was driven by anxiety and that was her toxic way of showing love. Caring too hard and too aggressive and oppressively.

However, what I will offer, OP: may you reach a point where you can see the behavior for what it is and feel more comfortable rejecting “loving” behavior that doesn’t suit you. 

Just because it’s the only way a person might be able to show they care, that doesn’t mean your obligated to contort yourself to accept it."
MomForAMinute,f7x1bki,t1_f7x12v7,1574043622.0,"Sounds fucked, but by your description it might be best in the long run. Didn’t sound like he contributed much in the way you’d want a father/husband to. 

While, of course, there aren’t many who would want the rug pulled up from under them in such a time, and the the hope is he was at least decent enough to be missed by his fiancé, maybe he was an even shittier human than you knew."
MomForAMinute,f7x0z8r,t1_f7x0rkh,1574043364.0,Someone absolutely cares. Please hang on. Today might feel like a pit you can’t crawl out of - but you will. There’s always a way to get to tomorrow.
MomForAMinute,f7x0rzz,t3_dxu9dy,1574043212.0,"I’m so sorry I haven’t provided you with the strongest example, and that you feel you need to lie to me to keep the tenuous peace we’ve found. 

But you’re right. You’re a woman now, one who seems to be perfectly willing and able to make the best decisions for herself.

Is it possible the truth will rupture this calm between us? Yes. But if it does, please don’t let it affect the bond you’re growing with your husband. Let it be a lesson, a comparison of what deep and respectful love looks like and what control looks like.

We will always love you, in our own way, even if the way we show it isn’t what you need. 

No matter what, I’m so proud you’ve grown beyond what we could give you."
MomForAMinute,f7x0frd,t3_dxvvoh,1574042960.0,"Sounds like you’re doing all the right things. Getting ahead of it with her therapist, giving her a physical space to record and reflect her thoughts. 

Death is complicated. You’ll see how it plays out with her and you’ll react the best way you know how. It’s all any good mom can do. She may surprise you, you may surprise yourself. 

How are you holding up about it?"
MomForAMinute,f7x08av,t3_dxp74x,1574042800.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. It sounds like he was an incredibly special person. That’s the legacy of a truly great person, isn’t it? The weight of their absence. 

As much as your mother’s heart is hurting it seems the legacy of their love is there to keep her going until she can find her feet again.

Deepest condolences to you and your family."
MomForAMinute,f7wzwku,t3_dxw4ug,1574042550.0,"Sweetheart, whether or not I’m saying the things you need me to say or doing the things you need me to do, believe that I love you with my entire heart and soul. I promise you that no matter what you need from me, I will walk over hot coals, all the way to the ends of the earth to keep you here with me - in whatever physical form that needs to be.

I am so sorry I haven’t been supporting you the way you clearly need me to. Please know that if i was aware of the seriousness of your suffering, I’d never let you walk this path alone. 

Even if I fail you, even if somehow you are unable to get through to me, you are not alone! There are so many people out in the world, organizations, individuals, other souls who know exactly word for word how you feel. Please find a way to hang on until I find my way back to being the mom you need me to be.

You are a beautiful, wonderful, precious person. Whatever journey you’re on, you will get to where you need to be and I pray that I’ll be with you, cheering you on all the way."

EatingDisorders,f7uigzw,t3_dx5nx5,1574015089.0,"For me, it was intuitive eating. It took a while of removing the judgment from food, but honestly, once o stopped seeing things as good/bad/forbidden, and allowed myself to have anything I wanted all the time it quickly lost its choke hold on me. 

Now I can keep all manner of foods in the house and even forget I have it. 

It’s a process, and it may not work for everyone, but it definitely helped me. 

Best of luck!"
MomForAMinute,f7ui2xf,t3_dxl7gx,1574014970.0,"Hi sweetheart, I am so sorry I didn’t appreciate how monumental an action that was. I take for granted that I always find you beautiful and precious even when you’re at your lowest. Perhaps I’ve been too immersed in my own struggles to truly understand the depths you were in and the significance of this act.

I am so proud you’ve taken this huge step towards fighting for yourself. The world has missed you and it’s so ready for you to come back to us. Keep fighting! Keep rocking that newly brushed hair and shaking away that miserable bear of depression."
EatingDisorders,f1cvxj5,t1_f1b0mue,1569367249.0,"It might take a while for your hormones to reset after the implant, especially since you continued with a different hormonal BC after the fact. 

Not saying that’s a bad move! You do what you have to, im just saying you might need to wait out some time while your body finds it’s new normal. 

I was on meds for a year that made me gain weight, weaned off, and it took legit 9 months for my metabolism to recoup. For the record, I weaned off with doctor supervision for reasons other than weight. Just saying it can take a while. ♥️"
EatingDisorders,f1acszs,t3_d8c6o2,1569290636.0,"Im so sorry! I am also really sensitive to hormonal BC. I’ve tried two types of pill, Nuvaring, and now I have a copper IUD because I have no desire to fuck with them anymore.  After having kids, even my regular PMSing is off the charts, so going on hormonal BC again was not something I was interested in. If you’re not comfortable with an iud, I personally found Nuvaring to be a pretty decent option. It’s just pricey. 

Have you considered removing the implant? For me, the only thing that got me off that hell ride was ditching them completely."
CaregiverSupport,et72u3u,t3_ca9bze,1562523581.0,"In my experience with three older family members, there isn’t a whole lot I’ve been able to find that will change their habits. My mother brags that didn’t even take her meds when she was in the hospital under a 48 hour psychiatric hold. 

My father is generally more compliant, but like yours, he fancies himself an expert. I will admit that a combination of bad experiences with dosage and contraindicated combinations has made him understandably wary. I mean, it was pretty bad, there was such poor consideration for their existing medications that they’d get pretty messed up from the conflicting effects. Now he takes them all to his pharmacist to double check before starting anything new. 

That said, I had to let go of his tweaking a long time ago. I have no leverage. With my mom it different because her issues are primarily psychiatric in nature, so in her case they had to hide her meds and have them measured and administered to her on a daily basis. It was a battle but she accidentally ODed once and that scared my dad straight to take over. 

So like the other poster mentioned, it might be some event scaring him straight, unfortunately, or a nurse coming in and administering it through a home health agency if he qualifies. I don’t know if her defy a professional to their face."
CaregiverSupport,errcc1b,t1_err5r2u,1561166345.0,"I understand. My aunt is in that situation. In her case I wouldn’t say it was karma. She was a good person who was the sole caregiver for her mother for over a decade until she passed. 

She doesn’t deserve to be alone, but she married an asshole who didn’t want children. She has a tortured  relationship with her sister, my mother (don’t blame her, I have a tortured relationship with her too), which just leaves me. Unfortunately, I am a working mom so my hours are limited as well. 

There are definitely those who are alone in their time of need because they burned their bridges. There are also those who, due to a myriad of reasons out of their control, are in the same lonely boat."
CaregiverSupport,erqx79o,t3_c11fs2,1561154351.0,"I can tell you from experience that there isn’t a whole lot id be willing to do for certain members of my family.

I commend those who are willing to see past the abuse they suffered from people when they were still well, but I’m not and I feel zero guilt about it. 

This is coming from the perspective of a caregiver and a therapist who sees patients at home. 

Active abuse is one thing I can’t condone, not only as mandated reporter but as a human being, but I’d never fault relations for not stepping up not knowing their history. 

My grandmother tried to set my mother on fire when she was a girl. I felt zero judgement towards my mother for not participating in her care as a hospice patient."
CaregiverSupport,ep37lan,t3_btdwin,1559019033.0,"You are a saint. My father and I are close but he also has mental health issues that causes frequent friction between us. 

I would never be able to deal with him coming and going as he pleases, especially in my home where I’m doing all the heavy lifting as a caregiver.

You might be sharing it with your mother in her time of need, which is amazing. Most people I know would not be willing to do so. But it’s still you and your husband’s home.

Keep up the good fight. I know you know what’s best and you know how to get it done."
CaregiverSupport,ep36dea,t3_btc7pj,1559018313.0,"Caregiver burnout is so common. It’s a slippery slope between taking care of your loved one and finding some balance for yourself.

Have you talked to a social worker? They might be able to allocate resources and services to take some of the burden off your shoulders.

I’m so sorry, even with extra help it’s still a lot. I know you’re doing your best and your best is absolutely good enough."
