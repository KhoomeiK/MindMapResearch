JoeRogan,fqpm94e,t3_gjtpz0,1589549626.0,"I actually left a comment on one of his videos a few days ago about this issue. His show used to inspire me, have me challenge my thoughts, listen to different perspectives. Now hes just ""fuck the news, fuck the WHO, fuck china, and haha look trump owned someone"". I hate using broad terms like this, but; his material has become majority ""right wing"" (if you look at it from a certain perspective). I dont mind listening to different views but I'm tired of him ""whining"" like you mentioned OP. Hes just bitching about everything, not taking the time to research anything, he doesnt look into things, he just assumes everyone is wrong. Hes letting his ego, bias, and ignorance gradually take over his show. 

I'm not bashing on anyone's political views; but you can see through his content how he USED TO view things objectively. Back in the day Joe would be terrified of the way journalists are being silenced. Joe would call out all politicians from both aisles for lying and being corrupt. Lately you see hes inviting Navy Seals, ex soldiers, people who all have a similar ""right wing"" view. I'm not a ""liberal"" (I dont think in these broad terms, I'm just using them to help explain my point) I'm neutral in between and I have liberal and conservative views. Unfortunately Joe hasnt been so neutral lately and I've stopped watching many of his videos.

Dont give me hate I'm just saying what I'm noticing. Maybe his content is your cup of tea; good for you."

BPD,fpwy3ge,t3_gfyltf,1588972084.0,"I dont enjoy attention seeking people but I dont enjoy kicking someone when they're down lol. 

I'm often on the opposite spectrum with posts on here because I'm ""cured"". I'm reading through these comments and it's sad to see you guys encouraging bad behavior. 

Yes it's ok to ask for help but doing so in a manipulative manner is not fair to anyone else. People are not stupid and eventually see through that kind of behavior. It's not accepted in society for a reason; because its unhealthy af. 

I'm seriously not trying to put you below me so please dont interpret it as that. I'm mature enough to recognize when I'm being manipulative and I avoid that behavior. I've grown up with alot of ""friends"" who ended up being manipulative or in general had a bad grip on their issues. They aren't in a good place now, many of them will never reach their full potential. 

So in conclusion to be frank; being manipulative for attention is harmful to yourself and others. Theres a mature and respectful way to ask for help. This world is filled with people who have their own problems, not everyone has to cater to your issues. However theres alot of caring people who just need to get the message from you in the right way. When people see manipulative behavior you cant blame them for hating it."
