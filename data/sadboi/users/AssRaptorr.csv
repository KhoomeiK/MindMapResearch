The only one who ever came to visit me in college was said girl, had great times with her. My best friend who I‚Äôve been through thick and thin with never came to visit once, even though he took a year off and constantly complained about being lonely. Fast forward about 8 months into college when that girl broke up with me saying the distance did too much. Kinda expected it. Came back home after college to find out that my best friend has been seeing this girl when I was gone and actually tricked her into coming to his house for a ‚Äúparty‚Äù (there was no party) and when she was too drunk to leave he took advantage of her.
