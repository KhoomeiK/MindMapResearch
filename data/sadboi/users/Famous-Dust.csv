relationships,fnkly6b,t3_g21ik6,1587032137.0,"First of all, I am so sorry for your loss.
Second, you need to get out of that house ASAP.
You deserve as much time as you need to grieve and your parents are being incredibly unhelpful in the process.
Is there any way you could go back to your apartment ?
I can't see a way of reasoning with them, from what you've written they dont seem like the type to be responsive."
EatingDisorders,fn6po1b,t3_fyasfr,1586704805.0,"I think it can be useful to ensure that you aren't undereating but I think in the beginning stages it's best to set out a food plan and go with that, then soon enough you'll be able to swap food in and out so you're just like okay I need some cards, some veggies and some protein at dinner but I can source them from whatever I like etc.
I know it seems counter productive but routine can be really helpful while you adjust to the extra food"
EatingDisorders,fn6pbd6,t3_fz1mh0,1586704590.0,"So, I know for sure that if I move a little bit I feel less stressed about food so say on the days that you can't get out you do a 30 minute home workout? There's loads of dance ones on YouTube and they're FUN which might help you de stress a bit.
I've found journalling has made a difference for me so that I don't slip into old habits.
Write down your feelings and work through it, try and remember the positives to recovery and focus more on that than calories etc."
EatingDisorders,fn6ot0z,t3_fz1pyj,1586704281.0,"So happy to hear that quarantine actually helped you break the cycle, WELL DONE!!
In terms of how to celebrate, what sort of things do you love doing?
For me fresh sheets, fresh pj's and a face mask while watching a movie is a sure way to chill out. Perhaps something like that? Or maybe journalling if you don't already, like write out positive things that you've achieved and benefits to it so you can look back should you reach a point where you need to"
EatingDisorders,fn6nxk9,t3_fzu2nw,1586703744.0,"Keep reminding yourself that only eating more isn't the solution recovery isn't just having a healthier routine with food or regaining weight, its taking the focus off food and your body altogether.
You are still sick all the while food rules your day, don't forget that.
Recovery is about getting to the stage where you no longer have to plan your days around meals"
EatingDisorders,fmsbjqn,t3_fx3tsb,1586351841.0,"Totally get where you're at rn love, a lot of stress can bring up old bad habits and unfortunately this is our way of 'dealing with it. I've been going on walks and listening to podcasts, I've started journaling again and I have made sure that I let myself have proper chill out time since we so rarely get to do that, its important to allow yourself to relax too xx"

ED recovery is so hard and when you gain weight people almost always act like you arent still sick or struggling, it's possible he meant it in a good way and it just came out all wrong but it isnt something I'd risk my mental and physical health over (I say this having gone through and come out the other side, it does get easier) x"

The only person that should be worried about how you're spending your work time is your boss and I'm sure he knows that employees arent as busy because of the situation.
Maybe start by trying to figure out why he was so mad, is it because of work ethic or is he just frustrated at having just as much work as he normally would?"
