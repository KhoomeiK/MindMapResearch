After she and her bf kill her mother they go to hide at his parents home which I forget for how long but it's quite a bit. She's mentally ill, it's plain for anyone to see, but I don't think that excuses what she did to her bf"

While I do get that terrible, terrible things. She had a chance to be different. She had the internet and other sources. There are so many other things she could've done instead of manipulate someone mentally weaker than her. Instead she choose to do that and I while I can feel sympathy for her I don't feel like she's absolved from blame."

If they can't afford to move out then they definitely can't afford a baby and everyone telling op that the baby won't be her responsibility have never been in the same house as a baby. What's worse is that ops immature daughter would probably act like an ass if she had a kid and Op didn't help out. Kinda how like she's acting like an ass now ignoring op who is doing the small little deed of PROVIDING HER WITH A HOME. Honestly this makes me want to not have kids...

Got out of a terrible relationship, i had a lot of family stuff going on (hence all the court talk) and it was really a time that I needed her to be there for me. She didn't even have to be that involved just a ""hey you can talk to me"" everyone once in awhile..or at least once. Instead it was always me comforting her for her problems and assuring her that they would be solved and not to worry too much about them. Anytime i'd even bring a spec of my problems into light she'd tell me to get over it and then proceed to berate me for something that she didn't like that i did a month ago (that i already apologised for *when i really shouldn't of* but whatever) I got tired of it and called her out. She denied it, kind of accepted it, then would play the victim and say i didn't care about her, at one point threatening suicide just so i could give her attention and make her feel good (she actually admitted it!!). Yea so I broke it off and left for a month but she kept texting.

I, being the idiot i am, decided to try to get things less rocky. Surprise, surprise! Went right back to the way things were dialed up to awkward and petty. I told her that it wasn't working and that i'm going to move on with my life and stopped texting back. The following ensued."
