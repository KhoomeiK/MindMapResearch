Advice,fqh7dtd,t3_giru8n,1589370102.0,"I have a few things that could help

-Take care of your mental health. 

-Take care od your body. 

-When you dont have motivation, have dicipline. 

-Embrace everything. Failures, wins, breakups, dates, fears, etc. 

-Know that life is not fair and you will likely fail often. But when you fail, get right back in the horse.

-Dont overthink things you have done, because you dont want your past to be your anchor.

However, i believe the two most important thing, is to be humble, and that you never give up."

Advice,fnwyfva,t3_g4b4ly,1587327916.0,"What i do:

-Wake up early and do some stretching, then i make coffe
-I also do intermittent fasting s√• i dont eat before around 2pm.
-I will work out, every, single, day. Bodyweight, Mountain hikes, runs, weight lifting, swimming. You name it. 
-after that i will make myself a good 3 egg omelette and have some Milk for to break my fasting. 
-Make dinner at like 5pm. I will have a good 1500 calorie meal with, well whatever i desire to be honest. 
-After a while i will work out again if i feel like it, but usually this is when i meditate.
-Dont go looking for happiness, but appreciate every moment of joy, and you shall feel happy. 
-I hang out with friends and family, and i tell them they matter to me, and that i love them. (in my own way, but i think they understand) 

In addition to this i have school and work. 
So i reschedule my plan above so that it suits the chores i have to get done. 

Worth to keep in mind:
-Meditation helps with mental health. 
-I work out because i love it, so consider it my hobby. 
-As you can imagine there is sparetime between all the things i do, and thats when i do school work, or play games, chill out or prep the next meal etc. 
-My rule is to do this everyday, but there are no rules without exeptions right? So let yourself go for Just a moment if you need to. But then get right back at it

And i cant stress this enough... 
Motivation is nice, but you cant rely on it. It comes and goes. It's more of a feeling, than anything else. 
Dicipline however, is going to get you further. Because when the motivation runs out, you can choose to have dicipline. 

A short summary would be: Have dicipline, and do the things you love to do, with those you love. 

Good luck, and i hope this helped in some way!"

You can DM it to me here on reddit or i can give you my mail. Your call.

The reason this transformation took 2 years for me was because i am quite stubborn. I wanted to be good at lifting weights and doing bodyweight workouts. But on top of that i do/did running cardio, mountain hikes and swimming. And as you may know, lifting weights and running slows one another down quite a bit. You burn muslce while running, and you make it harder to run when you gain more muslce.

But in the end it is definetly worth it because you will be athletic and way above average at almost everything.

In PE there were those that ran faster than me, and some did more weight in benchpress or squats than me. But there was not a single person who beat me in both strength and endurance. And that has always been a dream of mine.

Allow yourself to feel, and take your time. Dont compare yourself to others, as we all go through stuff differently. And if you feel like it, talk about it. Its healthy to get stuff off your chest. 

But dont get so caught up in it that you dont move on. You dont have to do that yet, but sooner or later you gotta move on. This is the price to pay for loving someone, and although it hurts it is worth it.

And when you get the strength to move forward, dont ever forget her. Dont look back and dwell to much, but remember where you came from!

Someone once asked me ""Do you hold on to the dicipline, even when it hurts? Even when there seems to be no hope or reason to?""
My answer was simply ""Especially then""

I believe in you guys. Even though i am quite young and it is far worse for a lot of you guys than it was for me, you can still break the sycle. It all comes down to heart!"

I might no longer fit in this sub
But there was a time i thought i'd never have this

I had a girlfriend, we have only Just broken up. We were not oficially boyfriend and girlfriend but i mean, we did all the things a couple do and had been ""together"" for months.

Anyways. Cuddling someone is the best fucking feeling that exists. Even better than sex if you ask me. And i hope all of you here in this sub get to do it sometime in your life.

The way i stepped out of forever being alone was to work out a ton, so i got a good body. I gained confidence and i got more diciplined. I k ow this wont work for every one, but i am really proud i made it after so many years of being a zero...."
