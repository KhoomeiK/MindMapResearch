And the things that make her happy could make other people happy, lots to see and learn. Especially with self care and emotional regulation, a therapist can truly help with that and to solidify good habits. We are all human and its ok to not be happy with ourselves but thats just it WE are all human we should take it easier on ourselves were no better and we all deserve better."

mentalhealth,f4umql2,t3_dlvxvy,1571818294.0,"Its good your letting it out. While you’re young its good to develop healthy habits and a mental health professional can definitely help you with coping mechanisms. Schools should provide some kind of counseling. Or you may be able to find some free services wherever you are. But definitely do something about it. Theres a lot to learn about and not just typical studies, theres also life experiences."
mentalhealth,f4kjjjq,t3_dkudp8,1571652580.0,Is this about control? Or like a power thing? Or like a coping mechanism for feeling hurt or powerless. Just curious. Or a level of appropriate reaction to over reaction?
mentalhealth,f4kcmkn,t3_dkuqt1,1571645889.0,Its as if your kidneys are complaining... and your body is telling you its hurting. I just thought this seemed provocative juxtaposed between balance and chaos and what feels good and what doesnt. Its not magic. But is it? You can get happy juices from everyday things. And when you get too high you start craving it tho.

mentalhealth,f487kws,t3_djoftx,1571433768.0,"The “suck at talking bout my feelings” part could be the reason why you are depressed and not the other way around. And also the “being perceived as weak/crazy” can be related too. Communicating emotions and needs is a skill along with everything else, being a skill. Yes theres always hope being hopeful is also a skill. Sometimes were dealt a really bad hand and its not our fault. Then again its our life, just the same line of thought that no one can dictate who we are and what we should do, then we are also responsible for making our lives better. So yeah loneliness sucks and no one else is gonna fix it.

You could try expressing your self on different mediums. Also happiness is important but its not everything in life there are other things that you could throw your energy into or you could be passionate about."

Also the ego can be very strong in some people and can overshadow other parts in terms of being able to relate to others. Its up to you tho to decide where you want to develop yourself"

mentalhealth,f2v46gu,t3_dedwi9,1570445016.0,Everything is gonna be ok! Friendships are only one facet of life. Focus on what you love and eventually youll find maybe a few people into what you love. Colleagues are made thru mutual experiences not just a flimsy promise. Band of brothers stuff and such.
mentalhealth,f2v4050,t1_f2uz9yg,1570444766.0,"Dude... honestly i dont think you should be telling people something so harsh. What society are you talking about? You sound like you know everything. Lots of different kinds of people out there. Good people can do bad things and bad people can do good things and then children grow up into adults you know what i mean? Sometimes we think were so important and sometimes we think we are insignificant, maybe identify when we feel too much one way and then balance them or pull from one side or the other for motivation. Even then who you are is up to you, regardless of what has happened to you or how people treat you, meaning you decide who you are not what other people have done to you. Maybe think outside of your experiences and be weird or go out and have an adventure. There are people you can connect with even if for just a moment because thats all those people can afford, we are a community. And when we find the right frequency or vibration with someone sometimes we become friends, speak naturally of your likes and dislikes and be open to opinion maybe? Anyways, you have control over your life even if its just the little things like basic needs and those healthy habits add up to alot more than people realize. It may take time and experience tho to realize that everything is going to be ok."

Also alcohol doesnt change your personality... some would say it makes things come out. 

And i am sorry you have to go thru this but in all honesty you only have control over yourself and what makes you happy, as in preferences. 

Dont be too hard on yourself, and dont be too hard on her. You guys probably have been good to each other and nothing can take that away. If the bond is deep then it will survive in some shape or form. Only time will truly tell and in the mean time, there are like countless things that you may incorporate into your life. Life isnt just one thing."

Fitness,f0y9gt4,t1_f0y2str,1569064499.0,Over a long period of time it can help. Yoga also develops the control muscles around problem areas and increases flexibility which all help relieve ankle knee and back pain. Helps you walk easier which gets you up more often. Its all connected blah blah blah. Its a long term solution if you know what i mean. Oh and it may not build stamina unless your heart rate is at a certain bpm for some people. But it can easily bring you to optimum weight loss bpm without too much effort.
love,ez7s0sb,t3_d02asq,1567727649.0,Hmmm love yourself first bro! Integrity is a difficult concept with many layers. First layer id say is your own personal life.
mentalhealth,eyzzr4r,t1_eyxug0j,1567627517.0,"Theres alot more to it, always a good idea to seek some help understanding our mental health. There are probably reasons why you have anxiety that you dont realize. Not sure if anyone can ever reach the point of never using a distraction or refocusing, tho. And im just assuming here but there may be some acronyms involved in your family. Not sure which ones because that would need an actual diagnosis from a therapist. Being able to identify these acronyms in my own family members brought me a lot of relief, helped me move on from some trauma, and to realize i have to take my health seriously cause im the one who has to deal with it. Some people just wont understand and thats ok.

Overall tho, it sounds like your taking steps in the right direction!"
mentalhealth,eyvn80f,t3_cyzpgt,1567502987.0,"Sorry that you have to go thru that and its wrong of your parents to be neglectful, if thats ok for me to say. You could try counseling at school. Also, theres alot of random things that happen all over the place and most of it will have nothing to do with you and yet it may seem terrifying or anxiety inducing. Sometimes we dont believe we have control over our lives and that also stresses us out, but imo its best to maintain an internal locus of control and do our best even when its difficult. Go easy on yourself tho everyone needs to develop those much needed skills to cope with the shit that goes on around us. Personally i learned about projection, mental states, meditation as a skill, freeing myself from expectations and getting what i want out of life, and lastly coffee!"
mentalhealth,eypga3u,t3_cy1oj1,1567299254.0,“Healthy” is subjective and up to individual standards. A person could have some kind of illness or trauma and still be healthy! Depends on what that person does with their health.
