Llooking at your requirements you are searching for a jack of all trades and master of most so you're more going to be looking for a standard phone rather than a gaming phone. That being said I'd recommend either the OnePlus 7T or 8 as even though the cameras are just okay and there is no headphone jack, it's probably your best choice."

Me and family were on holiday together and we went to a car sales place. We wanted to get another car for some reason, even though we already had one. Then, as we drove into the car dealership parking spot our car suddenly accelerated on its own and rammed into the car sales building. It destroyed most of the building and the top floor was crumbling. The used car salesman (who I will call Greg) thought we were trying to insurance scam him for some reason. 
There were two levels to this car sales place and we stood on the second floor which was almost collapsing. 
We looked down at ground floor where there were employees working on computers. We were looking at all of them becuase we thought one of them had remotely controlled our car to crash into the building (for unknown reasons).
I shouted a random name because I somehow knew which employee was responsible and his name. The evil employee started running. I made chase , then a captain America fighting montage happened with no context to the story. ( Literally I disappear and captain America is chasing him) . 

Now it completely changes time and place. I am watching from a helicopters perspective as this entire row of houses is getting flooded by tidal waves that had somehow been caused by the evil employee as a distraction to cover up his plot. (Now I'm back) I was fighting police, trying to get evidence that he had done this accelerating car thing as an insurance scam. 

Then I became this semi invincible guy who was fighting these people with guns. Like my head would be blown off then it would grow back.

I was doing this fighting to give time for Leonardo di-caprio to save Greg's daughter from drowning in the flood that the evil car dealership employee caused, which also for some reason destroyed his own house. Leonardo said he knew he had to save her when he ""kissed her little chops"" as a baby. He said he couldn't forget the love he felt. But for some reason it was a wet baby seal he was holding when it did a flashback to him kissing Greg's daughter as a baby. This was completely normal to me.

I was very pleased Leonardo DiCaprio had fell in love with this wet baby seal, which had at some point metamorphed into the girl he saved from drowning. It was all televised and stuff too. Not sure what happened to the evil car salesman employee or what his motivations were becuase I woke up."
