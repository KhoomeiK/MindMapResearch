mentalhealth,fllhi87,t1_fllhbru,1585260432.0,"Yes. It looks, smells, and tastes like normal weed but it doesn't have really any thc so there isn't any paranoia or head high. It works wonders. If you can get it where you are I highly recommend it."
mentalhealth,fllgsbf,t1_flld8fi,1585260040.0,It did but it took a while. I used the tincture if that's what you're using and had a similar experience. If you can get your hands on the CBD bud that's what I use daily. It's pretty instant and has the best effect for me and a lot of others.
mentalhealth,fllc26d,t3_fpix5v,1585257478.0,"From my experience, weed can definitely cause anxiety. I used to use it but I had a similar experience to yours. I had a major panic attack that lasted hours and after that I was anxious for a long time and any time I would try to smoke the feeling would come back and I'd be back at square one. It goes away, I'm happy to report. CBD helps me with my anxiety also."
mentalhealth,fk4y8tq,t3_fgexig,1583869904.0,"Yes. 
I dunno, anxiety is pretty cool?"
