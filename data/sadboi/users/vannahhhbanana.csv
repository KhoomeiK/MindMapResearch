depression,f6y8bxi,t3_dtq9q1,1573270785.0,Honestly I felt the same when I was in school 2 years later you will be in a totally different spot trust me things will come your way you never even expected. Everything will come together at once and make sense you just have to keep looking forward to that day. If you hurt yourself it will only  pass on to another person. you have so many silent lovers in this world that you dont even know about. Just hold on. sending love.  and not everyone in our generation is all that bad I think I'm pretty great if you need a friend hmu
