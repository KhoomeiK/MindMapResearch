The cooling trains, testimonies, people working for months trying to find body parts, families mourning. Could you explain how it's a false flag? This conspiracy sounds very insensitive, because that would mean bodies from MH370 were scattered across the field on purpose.

Our broadcasters showed detailed documentaries about the process of repatriating the bodies of the victims and there were testimonies of people living near the crash site, talking about how a body fell through a roof and that they kept it in the room.

Was this really planned?"
