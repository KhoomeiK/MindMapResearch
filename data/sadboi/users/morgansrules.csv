shrooms,fqug4s6,t3_gk7pys,1589658397.0,Have you tried therapy? Or if not are you open to that? I do get the appeal of shrooms and the idea that you can deal with all the daemons of your mind in one episode but I feel like depression is more of a long term game. And it will creep back into your life if not treated. There are some good options for online therapy as well. I am in therapy with someone I found using an online service and I feel she is really helped me a lot. Would you consider giving it a shot?

I mean I took my time before reaching out to a therapist because I just didn't have the energy to search and talk to people and see if we fit. And also filter through all the fake therapists out there, just thinking about doing that made me give up. But I finally found a therapist through a free online service that found me someone experienced with depression. I mean the therapy isn't free but my insurance covers it partly."

I do get her life is not the easiest either and people with BPD can easily trick an inexperienced therapist. Which is why she is getting no help in her therapy, just spinning things in order to blame others and not acknowledge her side of the blame. She probably doesn't even realize it. Regarding therapy for you, I would recommend hellodowntime.

But I like that I have enough time to get into deeper conversation and my therapist follows back with me with older issues I mentioned and so on. I used hellodowntime to find my therapist, they provide free matching between you and a therapist. I just filled out a form on their website and they did the work. Therapy, however, is not free, the cost is around 100$ for me but I am thinking you could mention your budget restrictions in the form? Most therapists do offer a sliding scale. It can seem expensive, but for me, it came to a point where my health had to come first so I found a way to make it work. I thought of it as actually investing in myself and it made all the difference. Also, it kinda forced me to take it seriously. If I was dishing out money every week, then I was going to make sure I was committed to the therapy work. With insurance, it's usually more affordable.

heryerdeonline,fqpvo7u,t3_gjeha0,1589554821.0,"I am still in online therapy at the moment and I think it's really helping me. Well, it was a bit of a trial and error at first. I went for some online platforms that everyone recommends but doing therapy via text and short 30 min calls didn't really work for me. So then I wanted to try something more like a traditional therapy session that lasts at least 50 min and that I can do online. I was really dreading looking for a therapist among the millions of ads for therapy that flood you when you start searching. I ended up using this free online service that matches you with a therapist based on a form that you fill out on their website. It's called hellodowntime.

I really like the therapist they matched me with and to me, it is worth it. Now, the price for therapy is kind of steep but I already knew that (around 100$). Most therapists offer a sliding scale.

I tried Better Help but I felt like the sessions were too short (30-40 min). Psychology Today is pretty good but I like how HelloDownTime does the search for you.

selfimprovement,fp9oxu0,t3_gbms4o,1588431431.0,"I think mental health is above anything else, and dealing with that first will help other aspects of your life fall into place as well. Have you been to therapy before? 

 I tried a service some time ago it's called HelloDownTime. It's basically a free matching service between you and a therapist. You just go to their website, fill out a form where you describe a bit of what your problems are and they match you with a therapist that has expertise in that area. Hope this helps!"
selfimprovement,fp9ok5i,t3_gbzsfm,1588431191.0,"I went through a similar situation after college, going back to live with my folks. The guilt of feeling I didn't meet expectations and also the social shame of telling my friends I am back in my hometown living with parents took a huge toll on me. I mean, looking back at the situation now (10 years passed since),  I made the right choice going back because I had no money to sustain myself from a junior job and also be able to focus on improving my skills on the side. But the anxiety, shame and guilt clouded my judgement soo much I just couldn't see past that. 

My advice for you is to take things one step at a time and try seeking professional help for your anxiety.  Because getting a grip on that will make your life much easier. I tried Psychology Today and HelloDownTime. Psychology Today is pretty good but I like how DownTime does the search for you and matches you with a therapist.  Hope this helps!"

therapy,fp9k7ml,t3_gbj4u7,1588428281.0,"I get you, and I went through a lot of anxiety and inner struggles back when I was 21-23. I was an overachiever who chose the wrong Uni program because I let my parents influence me way too much. So a lot of anxiety kicked in when I wasn't doing good in school and also wasn't at all interested in the classes much.

Looking back at that time, now I think my anxiety amplified the gravity of my situation by 300%. If I could only see things more clearly I think I could have made better choices. So my advice to you is to take things one at a time. Start by seeking out professional help for your anxiety. Because getting a grip on that will make your life much easier.

I always thought I was in control, I can totally let go of work whenever I wanted to, I just didn’t want to. But when my SO finally convinced me to take time off after 2 years and go on a nice holiday together I found it soo hard to not work. I was feeling guilty and just restless altogether. I would sneak around him in order to get a few hours of work in or at least check my emails when he was in the shower. I just couldn’t stop. So yea, when I got back from the trip I was even more tired than before I took the “time off”. I decided I needed help but I was dreading going through all the process of searching and trying out therapists.
