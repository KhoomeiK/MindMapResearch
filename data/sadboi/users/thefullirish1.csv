To say the only thing he in interested in from you is sx basically... that he is uninterested in you apart from sex

I totally understand the mind fuck of wanting to see him despite all this. It is the trauma bond. You’re addicted and going cold turkey on am addiction of any kind no matter how toxic is always hard but none more so than at times of distress

But you did all this by yourself and you amassed your savings in the first place and you are strong and if you can do it I promise you that in a matter of weeks you will begin to feel better and it will get easier every day you stay away."

Codependency,fn2qseg,t1_fn2pqdu,1586599549.0,"Seems to me that Op kind of brings it up in Saying he has only begun to think of men and women are the same when it comes to abuse

So op is fighting his own taken for granted assumptions about abuse and gender, namely that it somehow hurts less if a woman does it to a man..  women are somehow weaker so somehow they ought not to be able to hurt a man... men are stronger so should just take it... 

this argument itself originates in the notion that men are stronger / harder  / dominant / superior 

When one realises men and women are the same really one sees the abuse perpetrated by women as being just as bad as that perpetrated by men and one would never then mock or dismiss or undermine male victims

This is what is happened for op"

One was very like this, saw himself as helper / saver / business adviser (and took credit for his ex’s business success despite failing at his own business)

Other was much more nasty and didn’t have this in him. He dreamed of being in power so he could run the country as a police state"

changemyview,fmza14g,t3_fy2zy2,1586512360.0,"Storytellers write what they know

What do we know about the odds of diverse storytellers getting their stories made and voices heard?

What do we know about the odds of privileged homogeneous storytellers in certain geographic areas with certain demographics getting their stories onto the big screen?

For example Salman Rushdie is arguably one of the world’s great storytellers but only one of his books has been turned into a movie

And if you like hard data, just one in ten hollywood writers is a person of colour (source: https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2019-2-21-2019.pdf)

Our societies and cultures are rich and complex but there is a selection bias not just in casting but in story telling too

So whilst I accept your framing I think you are overlooking an important trait of hollywood storytellers - their own lack of diversity"
