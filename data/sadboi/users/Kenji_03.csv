I have to disagree. Any company who runs a multiplayer game needs to be able to revert to a backup. Bethesda themselves did this during the Christmas item theft glitch, where they reverted players to a save from 3 or 4 days prior.

Bethesda has 76 in maintenance mode when it comes to support, meaning they have a 3rd party handling support and haven't given them tools to do their job properly (either because they don't have those tools available at all for the ancient gambryo engine, or because it'd be too expensive to pay for a 3rd party support service that can be trusted with that much control over the game proper).

Bethesda doesn't care about retaining it's players, as it thinks it can always get new ones cheaper than keeping it's current ones."

The fact Bethesda is both so blatantly -- and so poorly -- trying to force their properties into MMOs (like Elder Scrolls Online and it's complete lack of anything new to bring to the table other than being an Elder Scrolls online game) is disheartening... but while I did enjoy my time with Fallout 76 post wastelanders.
