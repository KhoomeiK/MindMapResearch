I‚Äôve been with my psychiatrist for a about a year. Im really eager to try the cbd pen I got, but I‚Äôll wait until Monday when I can call my doctor up and ask about it."
CBD,fqn5v5e,t1_fqn5qof,1589489190.0,I‚Äôm planning to ask my doctor about it next month. He said that he hopes to get me off of my medications once I‚Äôm out of college which is now.

BipolarReddit,f57ll72,t3_dmyttx,1572038643.0,I was experiencing what felt like the worst depression ever and then feeling like everything was going to be just fine the next day. I was rapid cycling. I was also spending recklessly. I went to my psychiatrist on one of the days where I spent over $100 and he diagnosed me that day with bipolar 2.

BipolarReddit,f36mta1,t1_f36me5j,1570714612.0,Thanks for putting it that way. I have kind of narrowed down to a few interests because of the wide span of things I tried. Hopefully I can get back into one of the hobbies I like.

bipolar,f33t96j,t3_dfi6cr,1570644693.0,It only seems to happen to me when I‚Äôm in my depressed state. I can‚Äôt stand my partner when I feel like that. I feel like I‚Äôve fallen out of love with him when I‚Äôm there. But now I know that it‚Äôs just the episode that‚Äôs causing it and I do my best to not cause any damage to our relationship. He understands that I‚Äôm going through and episode and really accepts me. I wish you luck.

BipolarReddit,f28q8l6,t1_f28pu3b,1570068019.0,I impulsively got a cat last year. Luckily she was an adult so she is much easier to take care of than a kitten. I also took on a stray kitten but had to put him up for adoption because I was being way too impulsive and had no idea of how to take care of such a young kitten.
BipolarReddit,f28m9j7,t1_f28llno,1570065135.0,"It was one of the reasons I was diagnosed too. On the day I got diagnosed, I had spent over $100 on clothes right before coming to my psychiatrist appointment."
