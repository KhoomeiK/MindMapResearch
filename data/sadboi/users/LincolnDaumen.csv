The more I reread my words I realize I share the most with myself and here because it actually feels like all of us here who ache with this hear me more and understand more than those I interact with. I’m pretty isolated. I have like one of my own friends and the rest are “friends” by proxy of spouse. She’s a socialite. I herb up before I go on stage = life.  You sound like a really sweet person that the world doesn’t fully know how to respond. We are the hawks and eagles and ospreys flying high above. People see sides of us only in passing bit we remain part of a different world. Clumsily said but those are watercolor words."

Our friend battled a very real and present threat that couldn’t be fought off by any amount of likes or flippant comments. S/he was crying out for help as life was leaving her/him and we couldn’t hear it. We missed it, see. You not only embarrassed yourself with your poorly chosen and inelegant prattle, but you’ve also obscenely shat insensitivities and offended family and friends.

So, I come here. To my anonymous other consciousnesses, my devils and angels, sisters and brothers, strangers and friends, trustworthy and unreliable.
