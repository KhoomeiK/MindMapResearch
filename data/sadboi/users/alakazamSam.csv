I can't stand seeing bugs killed or killing bugs to the point I think it's the main part of my phobia, if I was to accidentally smush a bug I'd feel this horrible overwhelming don't wanna breath crawl out of my skin sense of dread and it's just plain disturbing to me to the point i guess I scared myself into being afraid of contact with them because I don't trust either I or the bug. I cannot stand people who kills bugs like it's nothing without a care in the world, not a second thought, not a change in perspective."

I just started getting ectopic beats which was once at night for three days and the third day it just turned into palpitations, one of my most frequent symptom is palpitations and they usually pop up after stress, triggering food, or laying down, I try not to think about and dread when a next beat may be because I'm sure it makes it worse but I'm sure those three won't be the last"

Anxiety,fhfutd3,t3_f2z7su,1581551811.0,"My parents said they noticed a change in middle school when I started to worry more and about ridiculous things and became very worse case scenario negative. I noticed it more in highschool slowly getting worse to the point I figured  something might be wrong with me, lots of avoidance, bad attendance, skipping lunches, not talking to friends if they didn't talk to me, not asking for help, skipping assignments, wearing the same hoodie everyday and being afraid of taking it off even in summer, dread and nerves and restlessness most of the time and ect ect. Then I graduated, combined with isolation from friends or socializing and unsure what to do next in terms or job or college and then the death of my childhood cat it became worse, more noticeable physical symptoms finally caught up with me and my first realized panic attack (I'd had panic attacks before without realizing) was because I felt faint and my heart started racing because I thought I was gonna pass out, kept having this for a couple weeks, then after a while it was just faintness with no full on attack, then it was palpitations and chest pain and that caused a couple more panic attacks and finally a hospital visit and doctor's visit where they found nothing wrong. So now I just need to figure out who the hell to talk to and if I need meds or not."

Funny though this subreddit is the first one I posted in since I made a reddit account, actually i think this is my only frequently posted in one. I feel less anxious here because everyone else feels the same. For some reason replies have been harder, especially nice ones, I feel like I should say more then thank you or might accidentally come off as rude or something ridiculous, like I don't know how to show my gratitude without being awkward or stiff."

I hardly talk to people online anymore and haven't made any online friends in a while, it's hard to keep conversations up even with someone I know In real life, I'm afraid I'm bothering and sometimes avoid starting conversation for weeks or just not reply yet hoping they just think I'm busy. I still haven't replied to some nice comments on a post i made a while back and it's sits in the back of my mind but it's too late to reply because it's been so long I guess. text notifications are usually like jumpscares lol. Coffee really helps me turn into a chatterbox but caffine is also worsening my anxiety issues so..I gotta find another way. I wish I could at least enjoy the internet but I feel isolated either way and it's awful and I need to fix it."

Also I haven't been replying to nice replies to my comments out of fear that I won't say something right or make it sound awkward instead of thankful or something I don't know, but it usually adds to the back of my head worry that they said something nice yet I haven't said anything back yet."
