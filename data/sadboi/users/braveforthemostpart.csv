This is definitely something to look out for but it seems like this is a very healthy thing if their relationship is otherwise independent. When you constantly live with someone and care about their wellbeing I can imagine that you'd want to help ease their suffering and it looks like they coexist very well together. That's the perspective at least.

Also, on the note of codependency, I very much understand anxiety surrounding it and think everything you said here is extremely valid and worth contemplating. Just wanting to make sure you know I'm not booing anything."

Even if i liked them enough to call them friends I'd hate how I have no space. Living in a loft has pushed me towards wanting a private bedroom just so i can close the door and no one can bother me. Also the walls are SO thin. If you talk loud enough the other bedroom can hear you. If you're on the phone anyone in the kitchen will hear. Also the sink isn't in the bathroom which is disgusting unless you force everyone to agree to use their elbows to exit the bathroom. I don't even cook when too many people are home and the last time i did it ended up being 5 people talking in that space and me having to say excuse me every five seconds.
