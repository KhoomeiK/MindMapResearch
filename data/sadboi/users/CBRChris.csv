CrohnsDisease,fquc1nd,t3_gktmy9,1589656052.0,"I had an ileostomy. It does present its own challenges but it can really change your quality of life. Much less pain, no uncontrollable urges to run to bathroom unless bag is filling up and even that you don't physically feel. No more diarrhea!!!
One of the big benefits is it gives the rest of your GI tract a chance to heal.
Would recommend. Plus it can be reversible if you decide to go that way!

Make sure you research all the pros and cons, and if you have anymore questions feel free to reply here or pm!"

Nope. Not even close. On so many meds my head spins, also waiting for the recurrence is a worst fear which nobody understands. The mental aspect of cancer is not appreciated... especially at a younger age.

Taking care of my girlfriend, calling my mother (while sober), opening a dialogue with my father (was not existant - only anger), and doing the best I could be as an role model for my 5 year younger brother....
I found these things were most important to me and gave me some purpose and meaningful ways to use my time to have a positive impact in others lives.
Soon I would like to volunteer for others in need, as I set myself in order first.
Just some thoughts on my way out of nihilism. Oh and of course the biggest relationship I had to work on was with my SELF.

SuicideWatch,fn9hf7k,t1_fn9fijo,1586773123.0,"This is very well written and for me the take home message is that as you mature from 18 and on, is you learn!!! I didn't know how to take care of myself at 18, let alone grocery shop etc! But now I'm 31 and have lived though hell with Crohns disease for 15 years and am currently going through cancer. And guess what.... I'm still here learning and growing. Even on those days where it would be easier to just say fuck it and end it all.

But what I have found is that growing older has made me so much more grateful for the small things in life. It sounds cheesy but its true. I never used to value family dinners, but now they are so special to me because it's a moment everyone comes together and you don't know if that will come around again. 

Bro I started out eating a loaf of garlic bread for supper or KD lol. Then you make small changes at a time and,  while we may never be 5 star chefs, we can certainly learn how to pick up a salad and start cooking chicken to gain more protein etc.

You just have to start somewhere and say.... what can I do tomorrow that will make my life .01% better. For me,  that's taking a shower and doing laundry. 

Also remember you are so young and your prefrontal cortex has not even had a chance to fully develop yet!  

Life is suffering dotted with sweet precious moments. 

Hope this helps somewhat. And remember,  people DO care about you. You opened yourself up on here and the quality replies and people behind the screens are a great example of the good in life.

My therapist told me this after every session and it took me quite a while to figure it out. But eventually it started to click. You have to show your self compassion and love.

So I drew a line in the sand. I forgave myself and I discussed this problem with friends and a therapist and the biggest thing I took away from it was that it means I have GROWN as a human being. If I hadn't then these things wouldn't bother me. 

So I look at it as a growth mindset and have extracted the lessons learned so that way I can apply them to the present moment. So far it has worked, I don't feel chained or embarrassed about my past because how else was I supposed to know any better back then!?

It's what you do today that counts and in another 10 years you'll look back and see how far you have come even since this point right now. You are doing the right things... keep it up!"
CrohnsDisease,fmbrm1e,t3_fu8i56,1585931935.0,"I had an ileocecal resection and had an ostomy bag. I debated long and hard.
It was the best decision I ever made, when they took out the part of my bowel it was severely strictured as seen on CT scan, but the color of it was so dark purple/BLACK it was essentially dead tissue.

The ostomy that comes with it has its own unique set of challenges as it heals. It will hurt, you will have leaks, you will have blisters all around once the stitches start to disolve, and you will have skin problems all around the site where the sticker from the ostomy bag holds onto (yeast infection etc). Depending on how fast things move through your body you will want to be +100% ready to change the bag so your friend doesnt decide to be active and start moving things through. 

Make sure you have lots of paper towel on hand.

ALWAYS fold the tab/seal/exit on the bottom of the bag BEFORE you put it on your body. I'll never forget I did a perfect bag change, right before my ostomy starts shooting out and all of a sudden I've got shit running down my body into the floor!!!! Lmao. After that.... every time I got a new box of supplies I would immediately open it and start closing all the tabs lol.

I wish you the best of luck in your decision and hope that didn't scare you off but they are realistic things that may or may not happen to you. That was just my experience/2 cents so take it for what it is worth. I advocate for surgery.
There is no better feeling than eliminating those gut wrenching pains and rushing to the bathroom."
