ask,fpqcall,t1_fpq9pl8,1588819614.0,Thank you so-so much. Although I tried explaining this they‚Äôre still pretty adamant I‚Äôm wrong. But I‚Äôll show them this and the calculator in hopes that they‚Äôll at least allow me five hours per day.
ask,fpq816m,t1_fpq3z0d,1588817032.0,"Thank you!!!!! I would only run it probably 5-8 hours a day depending on the heat. That‚Äôs far less than I thought, because people here were making it to be like a hundred dollars or something. Now I can actually show them this to prove it. You‚Äôre saving my life here."
SuicideWatch,f0k2vj0,t1_f0jzret,1568668951.0,It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm feeling a lot better now. ‚ù§Ô∏è
SuicideWatch,f0if7ft,t1_f0hm4d5,1568640839.0,Anyone to talk to is welcome right now. I feel so awful.
AnxietyDepression,exdv311,t1_exdv0ku,1566187656.0,Oh thank you so much. I will do that.
AnxietyDepression,exdu3q6,t1_exdtzkn,1566186771.0,Just knowing someone is willing to listen really helps.
AnxietyDepression,exdslxw,t1_exdsg85,1566185474.0,"I wish I could do that, but I have a full-time job. And because I can get so easily depressed I have to be careful because it can turn into suicidal thoughts. Right now I just feel numb and I‚Äôm trying really hard not to feel any of this because I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll have a breakdown."
AnxietyDepression,exdrpxz,t1_exd3uh6,1566184741.0,Thank you. Right now it just feels like my world is over and it‚Äôs so terrifying.
AnxietyDepression,exdpbfi,t1_exdlqzp,1566182821.0,Thank you. I really needed that right now. üòî
BreakUps,excdhrj,t1_excd76v,1566148169.0,"Thank you so much for taking the time to say this, it means a lot. I‚Äôm just beyond grief right now, but it helps to talk to people. Thank you for your words of encouragement."

hellblade,ewut78o,t1_ewudd6h,1565791079.0,"Thanks!!! I seriously thought I was just going crazy or just becoming completely incompetent. It happened when I was live-streaming which was hella embarrassing, but at least I know now that it‚Äôs not just me. üòú"
depression,ewu5130,t1_ewti65l,1565764705.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I want to tell you it gets easier...I believe it can, but healing can take so much longer than we realize. That‚Äôs one thing I find so frustrating about our society. People expect others to just get back up on their feet too quickly. There‚Äôs always this pressure and expectation to be okay. No...you know what? Sometimes we just aren‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs okay."
depression,ewtd3w2,t1_ewsumrg,1565742475.0,"‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm just tired.‚Äù üòï"
depression,ewswf3m,t1_ewrxq0c,1565736773.0,"I struggle with this, I hate it so much, because I‚Äôm actually such a nice person and I really like people, but anyone that meets me at first thinks I‚Äôm just super mean. It makes work so hard, because where I work we‚Äôre supposed to be happy, bubbly, friendly and outgoing. I can‚Äôt tell you how many bad reviews I‚Äôve got just because I can‚Äôt keep that mask on all the time."

hellblade,evu3kas,t3_ckyism,1564784788.0,"I appreciate it, but no thank you lol. I did see it, but I struggle with his films; they always seem to have themes of heavy loss and grief. As someone who has experienced heavy and sudden loss it‚Äôs just too close to home for me. 

I realize how contradictory that sounds because I love Hellblade, but I just loved the idea of Senua finding redemption by traversing through Hel to rescue the soul of the love her life."
TumblrInAction,eudux9c,t3_cfy834,1563728150.0,"Yeah I was gonna say, this post seems very unproblematic for this page lol."
