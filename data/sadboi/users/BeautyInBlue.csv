depression,fqufogw,t3_gkix6s,1589658134.0,I got my cat in the summer between my sophomore and junior year in college and I truly mean it when I say that he's saved my life. I developed horrible anxiety and depression after moving away from home and going to college (it ended up being way more than I could have ever anticipated). I adopted him and he has been my emotional support animal ever since lol. He is everything to me and I honestly don't remember what life was like before I had him. Animals are so special and they give life purpose and meaning!
aggies,fqfesoo,t3_gidqrl,1589323615.0,"My roommate and I used to rent a duplex in one of the neighborhoods over by the one on longmire. That store was hardly ever busy and we loved shopping there (because of that). Of course it's generally more expensive to live in college station than it is in Bryan, but if you're planning to live on campus I would recommend transferring to the one on longmire.

Of course after you transfer and start college, you can look for other jobs that are more related to your degree. But since you already have a job and have the ability to transfer I would absolutely do that. That way you don't lose your income."
personalfinance,fpxf6xg,t3_gfwr2u,1588981519.0,"I just want to pop in and say

DON'T USE SALLIE MAE.

You will get a million and one things in the mail from them and make you think they are the best option for student loans BUT THEY ARE NOT. I graduated only to find ALL OF MY LOANS WERE ON A 5 YEAR REPAYMENT PLAN AND THATS THE LONGEST REPAYMENT PLAN THEY HAD.

I'm sorry, but who comes out of college and lands a job where they can pay over $1000/month in JUST student loans? (And those were only my Sallie Mae loans...I had others as well.)

I actually think it was a couple grand a month and...it's just...ridiculous. I got mine refinanced through Wells Fargo and now I'm only paying $1000/month for ALL of my loans ðŸ™„

Learn from me and PLEASE FOR JESUS' SAKE DO YOUR RESEARCH."
aggies,fpxd3uc,t1_fpw5iuo,1588980316.0,"I had to switch majors (because my grades were dropping and if I didn't I was going to be put on academic probation) and it set me back. I ended up having to take a victory lap (whoop!) and even graduated with a couple of D's. I believe even one semester I dropped to part time so I could get my shit together but still get financial aid. 

Your story is meant to be your story. Your struggles aren't going to look like someone else's struggles. Shit, if I graduated from A&M, YOU can graduate from A&M.  And I mean that very sincerely - I was a basket case and threatened to quit every day...made mostly B's and C's because I had horrible, horrible anxiety. Would literally freeze up while studying because I was too overwhelmed...exams were even worse. Had panic attacks during classes and exams, fun times. You are absolutely capable!! You can do this!!"

I feel bad kinda but at the same time it's true? There are times where it feels like the life is being sucked out of me so I know how you feel. I had a few good weeks after I got into my second trimester but at almost 18 weeks I'm back to throwing up every day. 

I will be right here to commiserate with you. This is my first and I NEVER expected pregnancy to be like this! No one tells you about all of the shitty parts of bringing a baby into the world."

aggies,fnww901,t3_g4bczk,1587326681.0,"Class of '15 here - I just gotta say that I can't imagine what y'all are going through and how rough it must be taking ALL of your classes online. I occasionally took ONE class online every couple of semesters and HATED it. 

So, yeah, I completely understand where you're coming from where you're wanting to take a break before starting upper level courses because they can be more intense in some aspects. Personally I would email my advisor and see what their input is. I was that person who talked to my advisor every semester and it really helped, but I also had really awesome advisors (WFSC). If they are really going to make you reapply to get back into the university if you take a gap semester, definitely enroll part time and maybe pick harder classes because you'll have more time to dedicate to those classes (or if you're a procrastinator like me, pick easier classes - although you 100% will screw yourself over in your last semesters lol)

Anyway, much respect to y'all. Stay safe."

That vomiting though - that sounds horrible, I'm so sorry. Mine isn't that bad...at least not yet. Definitely going to try the cold food thing though. I already have started needing my drinks to be ICE ICE COLD which is different from normal. My husband had been thrown for a loop with that haha. He'll bring me a drink without ice and I'm like ""um?"" So then he has to go back and put ice in it ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
pregnant,fim4396,t3_f8kxt1,1582517605.0,"I'm still in my first trimester so I hope my feelings change, but YES. I AM SO MISERABLE. The puking. The nausea. The heartburn (already!). I'm exhausted. I don't want to move, ever.

AND THE SMELLS OMG. EVERYTHING SMELLS. BAD.

And I'm terrified of eating because I don't want to throw up but that's a double edged sword because if I don't eat anything then I'm going to get nauseous. So then I have all of these anti nausea drops and things to take but after using them for 3 weeks straight I don't like them anymore and can't stand the taste of them.

I swear if this ""morning"" sickness doesn't go away by the second trimester, this kid is legit going to kill me."
relationships,ff7kdf2,t3_erze6t,1579651612.0,"Your engagement is really the time for you to determine if y'all are compatible. Yes, you love him. Love is something that keeps us so blind in some ways. But while you're engaged you really need to figure out if your lives are compatible with each other. Don't settle for something that is going to give you heartache in the long run. I will say that for me, personally, I'm the type that believes marriage is sacred and is a life long commitment. If you believe that too, then you need to make sure you marry someone who is going to make sacrifices for you and that you are also going to be willing to make sacrifices for that person. Marriage is NOT easy. But when you marry the right person it is one of the most amazing things you can experience. Just please don't settle on the things that are most important to you. That will probably make you miserable. And resentful."
