The mental gymnastics you do to justify your world view is golden. I love how you bring in socialism and “extreme feminism” to justify your worldview, random... How is letting a woman have a choice over her body tyranny? Tyranny refers to government and ruling systems, not letting a woman decide what she wants to do, that’s called autonomy.  Tyranny is what Christians have always done to get their way and control people. As soon as I read that tyrant bit, I knew for sure this was all disingenuous.   When you argue with people, try not to arbitrarily (used correctly here) pick words and redefine them to your hacky benefit.

exchristian,fi0mqst,t1_fi0kajc,1582040462.0,"It’s not arbitrary or discrimination at all, the fetus is not self aware.  It has no experiences, no ties to reality, no investments in life, and no idea about the concept of suffering.  Once you have a child, your life is no longer about you.  You have to be prepared to take care of it and give it the best life you can.  Many parents don’t do that.  Those that heed the advice of the pro lifers shit out babies without any regard to their quality of life while growing up, that’s the Christian way of life.

Removing it from the world isn’t murder, it’s an act of mercy. Compared to a victim in war, it hasn’t truly begun to experience life on earth. Abortion isn’t a violent act for the sake of violence or death, it can be liberating for the would-be mother as well as the would-be person.  Existence is suffering, even if you’re born into a well off family. Preventing someone from having to deal with the struggles of life can be liberating.  The real injustice is that the government at the behest of dipshit Christians is controlling what women can do with their bodies. 


In case you haven’t noticed, the US military industrial complex goes to war with more than nations, typically they’re militias with their own agendas that use guerilla ware fare and are intermixed with the civilian population.  Just in the same way we can, and should, to let a woman choose what she can do with her own body, we can choose not to go into endless wars with no point other than for corporate profits and imperialist hegemony. 

Thanks for making my argument for me, in that the pro life movement prioritizes ruining other people’s lives and forcing people into an unstable and miserable existence, while ignoring truly preventable death and suffering by war. Not just deaths of foreigners, by Americans too (in my case, anyway).  That’s right, the pro life movement would rather see full grown service people die in pointless war than see someone try to make the best of a tough situation and make a better life for themself.

Also: a fetus is not a person"

Fuck god and Abrahamic religions, they’re a cancer on the Earth.  God doesn’t deserve to be capitalized because he isn’t real, and every time I see him or his capitalized, it looks like the person who wrote it has shit grammar.  

Christ didn’t do shit for anyone, there isn’t even solid proof he even existed.  Even if he existed, he was just a human.  It was said his crucifixion was short,  so if it happened as written, he likely just went unconscious; as in, his resurrection is something only ancient people with limited medical knowledge should fall for something like that. 


The Bible is a self referencing piece of garbage and can’t be used as evidence.  Most Christians cherry pick the Bible and even the self identifying literalists and fundamentalists will ignore things like wearing mixed fabrics, eating shellfish, and of course the no murder thing other than when dealing with pagans and witches.   The Bible contradicts itself all the time and doesn’t have consistent morals, just authoritarian dogma.  The only good the Bible is for is kindling for starting fires.  

It wouldn’t even matter to me even if god existed, because that would mean one of three things regarding how he handles all the horrible things that happen to people for no reason or justification:  he is not aware of anything going on, he is unable to change anything going on, or he is unwilling to change anything going on, in any case Christianity is a worthless religion with a powerless god that deserves no worship, and Christianity should be taxed out of existence

The moderator would let Charlie speak for 10 minutes at a time and then Kyle was allowed like 5 seconds to respond each time.  When he was allowed to talk he always cut the chase and pointed out the bullshit.  I don’t think he lost at all, he just had to deal with long monologues that diluted his rebuttals"
