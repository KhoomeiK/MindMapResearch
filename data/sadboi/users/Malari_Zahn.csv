What are you talking about?? With each patch you get a new bonus hard mode! 

No stam regen in pvp on your stam character - woot! 

Magicka skills pulling from your stam pool in a dungeon on your healer - hell yeah!

Randomly losing the ability to barswap or even use your skills in Cyro. Being in constant combat so you can never mount and have to run to the next keep. Freezing up and crashing if you run through that little area between Winter's and Chal. Lag when more than 3 people are in a keep. Emptying your ult pool but not actually giving you the ulti.

This. A hundred times. This.

It's gonna look scary to be in the middle of the fight with the rest of your team. But, that's where the heals and buffs are! That's where you have personal guards, that you can kite in between, that can trash the person that is trying to dizzying-swing you in the back. That's where you have the best shot at catching a res when you die.

Not only ask that, but you'll learn the mechanics so much faster because you'll automatically start to copy your more veteran team mates moves. This is where you'll start to learn who to target in a group, since you will probably be hitting the same person. 

If you roll around with someone good, that is in your same class, try to stick with them and watch when they throw down their casted abilities, when they throw out the stun, when they execute and when they buff/heal. Even if you're not using the same sets or skills, most likely you will benefit from using their same rotation of the above categories.

And while having one person to follow and kite around is really helpful to you, it also means that you can provide backup on whatever target they're hitting. You get more benefits from running close to your pack, and they will too!"

**Barbed Trap** - grants you Minor Force

**Blockade** - sets concussed enemies *off balance*, if you're using a shock staff. Deals additional damage to burning enemies, if you're using an inferno. 

**Purifying Light** - Heal over time, as well. I actually prefer the stamina morph though (**Power of the Light**), on my magplar healer, as it is super cheap to cast and provides Minor Fracture and Minor Breach.

elderscrollsonline,fjgz5sg,t1_fjgosal,1583338372.0,"My main is a 9-trait, titled Grand Master Crafter. She's the one that makes the gear and takes care of most the master writs. 

I currently have a total of 6 alts that I use weekly. At the very least, I want my alts to be do 4 things. 

1) Make their own food. This means they each get a purple max level tri-stat recipe to learn. If they're vampires, they also learn the two Mara recipes; if they're a werewolf, they learn the bone pack leader. They also snap up and learn every recipe they find in guild traders for under 100 gold. A bit expensive, but worth it to not have to keep track of each character's food stacks. Also, they can make food for guildies in a pinch and it saves me from having to constantly switch back to my main. 

2) They each have to be able to make their own pots. Again, I don't want to have to keep tabs on everyone's potions and they can make pots for guildies.

3) They each need to be able to get the highest level mats from deconning the trash they accumulate. When I just had one alt, it was reasonable for them to put blue and purple trash in the bank for my main to decon, but I would run out of bank space too quickly without them each being able to decon stuff themselves. One exception: jewelry - it takes forever to level jewelry enough, so I only have a few toons that I decon blue and purple trash with.

4) Each toon will research the top 3-4 traits that they may need to use for transmutation purposes. Again, I don't want to need to switch to my crafter so that a helm can be transmuted to divines or impen. That involves unequiping the armor, putting it in the bank, switching toons, transmuting, switching, grabbing the gear back out of the bank and re-equipping. I'm embarrassed to admit the number of times I've gone without a piece of gear on a toon because I forgot to grab it out of the bank after my crafter transmuted the trait - so now they each focus on learning the traits that they may need so each can do their own transmuting. And, since I'm a pvp-er, I end up with a lot of transmute crystals and do a lot of transmuting in the course of my play.

Ideally, I would like for each alt to have their initial crafting passives to be at the max to reap the better hierling rewards and have better chances at master writs, but that's a ton of skill points on toons that aren't created to do story content (the story lines contain quite a few skill points) - my main is a pot-head, so I'm definitely not missing out on the beautiful world that the story lines create.

Sorry for the novel, lol! Hope this helps!

Ninja edits to add - 

**Alchemy**
maxing out alchemy is needed to unlock all three passive points for *Medicinal Use* - get this passive! It will extend the active time of a pot past its cooldown time. This means you can, in effect, run pots 100% of the time.

**Provisioning**
Maxing out *Chef* and *Brewer* passives allows you to create multiple servings from singular mats, thereby saving you a lot of material over the life of the toon. And some provisioning materials for the better recipes are quite expensive - looking at you *Arteum Takeaway Broth*."

elderscrollsonline,fja2jkl,t1_fj7t4wl,1583165024.0,"The unlocked cp campaign still has a day or two left on it. That's, more than likely, plenty of time to grab tier 1 on multiple characters (of course, depending on your available play time).

Type lfg (looking for group) into zone chat once you're in Cyrodiil and riding along with a group for around an hour should get you to tier one. If you don't get added to a group, which may happen if there aren't a lot of players in the campaign, you can check out the map to find the action and then kinda tag along with other players as they head out to the next spots. Ways to spot the action - look for flagged keeps or resources and head to them, or look for keeps of the other team that have resources captured by your team (this means that your team will probably be hitting the keep). 

Bring siege - regular ballistas for the doors (5ish), rams (2 or 3, you probably won't be expected to have any, but it's always a nice surprise when the new person does!), oils (around 5), wood repair kits (25 - 50) are pretty much the essentials. You could also get some meatbag catapults (my preference) and lightening ballistas to use against players. I also highly recommend purchasing some recall stones - they're 20k AP each, but more than clutch when needing to catch up with your group (and all the AP that they're earning!). 

Since you will need to slot each siege item type on your wheel to be able to use it, I'd say to keep your types of siege down to 5 item types at most, just for now. I personally slot regular ballistas, an anti-personnel siege (cold fire, not available to purchase with siege merchants, or meatbags), wood repair kits, siege repair kits (great for making sure my group is able to use their cold fire siege for a long time, as seige breaks down over time), oils and camps. Camps are clutch, but also very expensive (20k AP) and not usually expected from lfg's.

Repair doors on your way out of the keep. It helps make sure that your team retains the keep, but also, it will give you marginal AP for the repair itself and can possibly give you a defensive tic that can equal 1-2k AP.

I make both sets in purple for the extra training percent and survivability in Cyro. While both of these sets are theoretically available to everyone, a freshly made account is not likely to have the 6 traits needed to craft AD, much less the 9 traits needed to craft NMA. They also are going to lack some of the materials that are needed that my cp 900 has amassed over time and has an abundance of.

My pvp guild has roughly 20 active members and we have five 9-trait crafters among us! And let me tell you, us 9 traits are fighting over who gets to craft the gear for our guildies, lol!

I will frequently switch her between heals, dps or a hybrid of the two - just depending on what my guildies need at the time and what is being run.

For my skill bars, I never run one bar only deeps or only heals.

I am a care-taker, by nature. I love to help out my guildies. I enjoy being able to craft them things that will make their gameplay more fun. 

I just joined a pvp guild and have only been pvp-ing for a month or so. I'm not the best in Cyrodiil, I kinda stink at BG's and IC always kicks my ass. But, I can craft all the gears for my pvp peeps! 

One of my guildies was giving me shit yesterday (all in fun!), saying that he only joined the guild was because I told him that I'd craft him some training gear - **hells yeah! I brought in new blood!** This is how most 9 trait crafters will view you joining up just for the crafted goodies. :)

And, don't be too surprised when we start to drag you along to fun content that you haven't been able to run yet. :D

You, and others like you OP, are why we put in the energy to grinding out our Grand Master Crafter title and have researched all the traits. Don't deny us our joy! :p"
elderscrollsonline,fi0kid0,t1_fi0gf3w,1582039070.0,"While yes, you can transmute the traits, it's pretty expensive to do so, at 50 crystals each. And you need to have researched the trait that you want to put on the piece.

For MS, I honestly don't think it's worth transmuting the traits on most of the pieces, aside from, of course, the inferno staff and jewelry (as they will only come in arcane). Most of the pieces traited with divines are generally not too expensive at guild traders - less than 5k gold for the smaller pieces, around 10k gold for the chest and legs. I don't even sell any that I loot anymore since there's not a ton of money to be made with them and just save them to give to friends/guildies.

If you're willing to look at other traits than just divines, then you can pull together a set for fairly cheap. Infused is a great trait alternative to divines, but sells for a lot less. Well-fitted for feet, waist or hands is also not a bad alternative - if we're strictly speaking about putting together the set for the first time.

OP, you're newly max level, you have a lot of time still to find the perfect pieces. I wouldn't sweat it too much that traits aren't all BIS at this point. It's better to have the full set, with some off-traited pieces than to wait until you have all pieces in divines to be able to use it."

For me, my big goal for my first 9 months of play was to be able to make everything pretty! So, for my house that meant knowing all the furnishing plans and being able to purchase all the pretty achievement furnishings. For my crafting station, that meant unlocking all the pretty dyes and motifs (and yes, I pushed for emp just for the red dye, lol. It was worth it!). 

These may seem like superficial goals that would limit my interaction with the world that eso provides, but in actuality, it made me dive deeper into the gameplay than I might have otherwise. After completing Lair of Marselok (new DLC dungeon) I could buy all the pretty blue glowy plants! I had to level up all my crafting to be able to make all the pretties for my house. I've completed all zone quests/dolmans/world bosses etc just for a color at my dye station. Hell, I got the pvp Emperor achievement because I really wanted the Ruby Red Throne dye color - and I'm closing in on the Legate pvp level for that deepest black dye known in all of Tamriel (the Legate level requires a crap ton of leveling in pvp and will prob take me another 4-6 months to earn). Now, I'm parsing on a trial dummy everyday to break my dps plateau of 40k so I can get all the end game skins.

My point is, decide what makes you happy in the game. Then pursue all the things you need to accomplish to get to that goal. :)

elderscrollsonline,fhb9t99,t1_fh8yp3g,1581437838.0,"Your magicka sustain will come from a couple different sources - your gear weight and sets bonuses, it's level and its enchants (glyphs) and their levels and their traits; your pool vs recovery; your passives; your champion points; your mundus; your food; your pots; your skills, damage and your outgoing damage expense. Before farming new gear, consider the following aspects of resource management and you'll probably find you don't necessarily need new sets. 

**Your gear** - for a magicka based character, you want to be in at least 5 pieces of light gear to take advantage of some passives that aid magicka based players. As well, the set bonuses on light gear will predominantly benefit a magicka user. You've got the light sets, so that's good!

You don't mention your level, but make sure that you haven't outgrown your gear. Once you hit cp 160, you want to make sure that you're replacing any pieces that are lower than 160 - all gear will be maxed level at 160.

**Enchants (glyphs)** - Each piece of gear can have an enchant (glyph). These enchants can be easily changed out!! You can get a wide variety of benefits to your build through enchants - larger resource (health, stamina or magicka) pool, higher resource regen, increased spell damage, added elemental damage, etc. If you're not familiar with enchants, please make sure to read up on them - they can really change the feel of your build and help you customize it for your needs.

Enchants will have 2 levels to pay attention to - their cp level and the quality (white, green, blue, purple, gold). The enchant level will need to match your gear level to be usable on that piece, and not your character level. You may be level cp 200, but if a piece of your gear is cp10, then that piece cannot be enchanted with a glyph with a higher level than cp10. 

The quality of the glyph will boost its stat. A green glyph may provide 400 magicka, while it's purple counterpart will provide 550 magicka. For the glyph level, your enchant must be the same or lower level than the gear, but you can use any quality level. So, you can put gold glyphs on blue gear. Also, if you level up the quality of a piece of gear from green to blue, this will automatically level the quality of your glyph from green to blue. 

Make sure you have enchants on all your gear - although, set pieces that you pick up in gameplay will always have enchants on them.  

**Traits** Each piece of your gear will have a trait (divines, invigorating, sturdy, etc). You're going to be pretty stuck with the trait your gear has, as it's expensive to change it and requires that you've completed the research on the trait that you'd want to change it to and transmuting the trait will bind it to your account, meaning that you can't have a crafter switch out your trait for you. For light gear, best in slot is *divines* - boosts your mundus stone effects. *Infused*, paired with a good glyph, is also decent for light gear - will boost the enchant on the piece. You may be missing out on a lot of magicka pool and recovery through your gear traits.

**Pool vs Recovery** You'll want to find a good balance, for you, of how much magicka you have in your pool and how much you recover per second. But, a higher magical pool will increase the damage a lot of your skills put out, as their damage level is based on your max or available pool of magicka.

Make sure you're putting skill points into your passives that boost your magicka pool, decrease the costs of your skills or boost their damage. You'll have passives in your class (Necro), light armor, weapon and vampire lines that will help you manage your resources. 

**Champion points** Check out your champion points, if you've leveled past 50, and make sure you have them set up to optimize your play style. You can look online for guides to start you out in the right direction, and then tweak them from there. Redoing your champion points is easy and relatively cheap (3000 gold), so don't be afraid to test out different setups. Point to note - cp percentages round down. So, an increase at 13.05% and one at 13.98% will both be effectively 13%, although you may spend 4 cp going from 13.05% to 13.98%. Just keep that in mind when allocating your cp and if you don't have enough points to boost you to the next whole number, then consider dumping those cp into another cp passive. 

**Mundus** Make sure you're wearing a mundus stone and that it's the right one for you. Mundus stones are easily changed out, and free to do so. To equip a mundus, just walk up to one and select it. They're found in the wild, 3 per base zone and there's 13 total to choose from. You can only have one equiped at a time. 

**Food** Food, or drink, is a necessary buff. Make sure you're always using food and that is the right food for you. Some food will give you buffs to one resource, some will give buffs to two and some to three. These buffs can be an increase to your resource pool, or offer extra recovery, or both. Try out a couple different kinds - you can find them in guild traders, craft them yourself or use the crown meals from your daily rewards. You can only use one food or drink at a time, they don't stack and most will last for one or two hours.

**Pots** Potions are an important part of sustain. Pots will last only a short time, as in less than a minute, but can offer huge buffs to your resource recovery. They also can offer pretty nifty benefits - invisibly, immovability, extra spell and crit damage, etc... Adding skill points into the Alchemy passive, *Medicinal use* will increase the uptime of your pots and is pretty required to take advantage of these buffs at the higher level content.

**Skill management** Some skills, just by being slotted on your bar, will offer boosts to your magicka pool, recovery or damage. Some skills will offer these buffs only when activated. If you get familiar with your skills and their added benefits, you'll be able to more easily control your resource pool. As well, some of your class passives will buff the skills that you have slotted.

**Damage** Finally, manage your magicka expense. Some skills are pretty expensive. Usually though, these expensive skills offer damage over time and don't need to be spammed - if the duration of the skill effect is 8 seconds, then you really only need to use the skill every 7 or 8 seconds to take full advantage of it. Use your cheaper skills during that 7 seconds. 

And start practicing throwing in a light attack between each skill. Light attacks are free! They give time for your magicka to regen. And they can be a pretty big portion of your overall damage. You'll have an enchant on your weapon that will be proc'd by your light attacks, adding even more damage potentially, while also possibly boosting your recovery (absorb magicka enchant, for example).

Use heavy attacks to regen magicka. Enemies that are ""off balance"" and then hit with a heavy lightening attack will provide even more magicka regen. 

Hope this helps. I've probably forgotten some things, but there's lots of guides out there that will go into much more depth. I'd highly suggest checking them out. Just be sure to check that they're more recently written. And have fun storming the castle!"
