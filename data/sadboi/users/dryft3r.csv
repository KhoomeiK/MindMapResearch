In the right relationship what your boyfriend is doing could be totally fine, with someone who would enjoy a joke like that, but this is not the one.

If he doesn't know how badly it affects you, then you need to tell him. 

If he does know, or should because you've explained it to him, then this is unacceptable and he needs to stop or you need to do something about it. 

If you never explained it and just assumed that he would get it from your reaction then that's not enough because he clearly didn't get it. 

If you have then you need to think about how you can improve this situation or remove yourself from it because this is not okay."

And it's a pretty simple issue to deal with once you get used to it. It's not fast, but once you get started it's something where you see constant progress that keeps you motivated.

Additionally, you could only remotely have a point if you're talking exclusively about porn featuring those actions, rape, murder, etc, which is by far a minority. That doesn't explain how the rest of porn is ""bad for the brain"". Yes it can give people false expectations but that doesn't mean it's ""bad for the brain"", whatever that is even supposed to mean.

I'm not putting any words in your mouth, I'm drawing simple logical conclusions from the ridiculous stuff you're saying, but keep saying me uneducated while simply claiming you are right anyways.

""Porn causes rapes and murders"" this is almost dumber than blaming it on video games. You know that people have been murdering and raping long before porn was a thing? You realize that we live in the safest times humanity has ever seen?

BPD,ew6bys0,t1_ew6bojm,1565162086.0,"Just because you're unhappy about me calling you out instead of giving you an echo chamber doesn't mean I'm not being constructive, it just means you're dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with you. 

All you've talked about is how you want to talk your boyfriend into not watching porn with no real reason other than your issues with it which seems to be based purely on jealousy or insecurity. If it's not that please explain why he can't ""spend his own energy"" getting off to whatever he wants. When you try to say that masturbation is fine as long as it's to you then that leads to a very simple conclusion, offhandedly mentioning ""spirituality"" as an excuse doesn't change that.
