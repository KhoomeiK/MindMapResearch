Dear_Mr_Atheist,fqghapz,t3_gimi85,1589346258.0,"Woah that takes me back. It seems to be a trailer of the second movie of the ""God's not dead"" trilogy (or at least I think its a trilogy last time I checked). Got forced to watch them as a group activity at school once since they are some super religious people.
I think the first was about a college student 'proving' how his atheist teacher was wrong.
It had a bunch of dumb arguments they tried to present and showed atheism as simply people that hate god if I remember correctly.
It's pretty ironic that it showed up on one of Jimmys' vid tho"

mentalhealth,flurrjc,t3_fr3hp9,1585508667.0,"Can totally relate. I feel like I'm being overly dramatic when I consider stuff like dinamite exploding infront of my house and getting traped in a classroom when a gas bomb was thrown at my school, to be traumatic. Like I didn't even see the dinamite being thrown or the small explosion, I just heard the sound of them blowing up, same with the gas bomb, I only felt the tear gas approching and ran to the rooms with my classmates.
Logically I know events like these are not normal for a child to experience but still... it feels like something I should just brush off and get over with cause other people have had it worse. It's a hard feeling to get rid of but the important part is to try to accept that what happened is not okay and that it's OKAY to NOT to be OKAY."

atheism,fkezjce,t3_fhw6qx,1584123961.0,"What made me turn to atheism was the fact that after being shoved from one christian church to another and being fed a bunch of contradicting bullshit I ended up as a miserable kid that found confort in the idea of  *Death!* I was fucking 9 years old and the church just complemented my thoughts of a better world for me after death! It was a rough journey but only once I escaped all those toxic thoughts did I really begin to live and be happy with myself and who I am. Sure I still have some things to work through but I am way better now than I ever would have been if I stayed at the church.

TL;DR  I tried a bunch of different christian churches. They were all toxic. I was a messed up kid. Turned to atheism and am now leading a healthier lifestyle."
