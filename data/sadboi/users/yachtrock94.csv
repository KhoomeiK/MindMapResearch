But now having played in a few, I have to admit they were very stressful and not totally how I imagined them to be honest. There can be a lot of drama and arguments, and you're often putting in a lot of work and money for very little reward. 

I guess it depends if you're with the right people and in the right place at the right time. A harsh reality of being successful in music is that a lot of it is luck."
