However, on round 5 when there's time limit, I can't win because it already takes me a few seconds to safely bring down the ball and by the time I start hitting the circles...well let's just say I always lost on round 5. But I still managed to get some books :)"

HPHogwartsMystery,fp1fk4a,t3_g8ss7n,1588233826.0,"Anyone like me having ball problems?

I had around 100 tickets and tried this event because I'm pretty good at  quidditch matches but I kept losing at the first stage because whenever  I touched the ball, for some reason it moves upwards and hits the  circles which gives me 4 red yikes and I end up losing the match. Anyone  has a solution for that? 

It also happens when I play the friendly quidditch matches, however, the circles are much higher in them, so when the ball moves upwards, it doesn't touch the circles so I can win."

SuicideWatch,f8bbkl9,t3_dyc4yh,1574432795.0,"I did it everyday for a few months last year after a really bad break up (6 year live-in relationship). Then I met someone new and thought she was my soulmate. Turned out after 9 months, she didn't want me either. Now I'm back to square one thinking about the above question everyday. No one will mourn, no one will be sad, no one will feel a void in their lives. Everybody's life will carry on just as usual. Since yesterday, I'm thinking: What's the point of living a sad lonely miserable life? Isn't it better to just die and hopefully start a new one afresh?"
