I know that I’m very privileged since I can keep my job post and continue with my university classes online, but thanks to that I’ve been thriving during the social isolation time. And it makes me even more anxious about the return to normal life.

I‘be been exercising daily or every other day. My eating habits have not been this good over the past ten years (I have severe anxiety and I usually starve myself until I come home in the evening). I can focus on things that I enjoy doing - photography, writing, reading, catching up on movies and series I wanted to watch. Nobody expects me to leave my house unless it’s really necessary, nobody pushes me to join them at the parties. 

Now I fear that I’ve become far too comfortable at my own place, having myself as the only companion. I’m anxious about the return of my crowded commute, disordered eating habits and everyone expecting me to be constantly meeting them or partying with them."

childfree,fadn3rm,t3_e8mpht,1575979746.0,"THANK YOU! Damn, this has been bugging me for so long.

First of all - how can I use my maternity leave having no baby? A girl joined our work at a similar time as I did (ca. 5 years ago). Guess what, she spent basically four out of these five eyars at home. Since each of her pregnancies was complicated, she was put on bed rest and obviously did not work (which I do not blame her for, nobody wants a complicated pregnancy). Then, we have a relatively long maternity leave that you can combine with your due annual holiday leave, which resulted in her being absent for about a year following each birth.  I want this paid time off as well.

Her kids are relatively small but we also have a colleague who has a boy and a girl, aged 12 and 7 respectively. She presents motherhood as a string of tedious chores, keeps on updating us all on her sleepless nights (your kids are 12 and 7 Susan, I'm pretty sure there's no need for you to stay awake and wait for the laundry to be done) because the work gets in her way of completing all of household chores. Sometimes I wonder why she insists on working since she could easily stay at home with her husband's earnings. She keeps on leaving early because she has to ""take her kids to karate, French classes"" and all other stuff that could easily be done by her husband but as a CEO of his own company he clearly cannot be bothered with such mundane stuff. Recently she said that our other childfree co-worker was really rude taking a day off on Christmas Eve because **she has children** and there's a lot of preparation when you have a family. I mean - come on. I couldn't believe in whatever she was saying.

I don't blame her for kids being sick, leaving work to pick up a child that ended up in A&E for some reason or whatever else - just please do respect the fact that the whole workplace does not revolve around your family life."

Most of her skaters gain fame and best results prior to puberty, with their bodies not subject to hormonal changes and typical adipose tissue development. But as soon as their bodies start to change and they need to adapt to that new situation, there's little support.

I know it's going to sound harsh but it seems like figure skaters are a disposable good in Russia - whenever a skinny girl gains a bit of weight and loses her jumps, she is replaced by another younger talented skater with a body of a child. That's why most of them retire by the age of 17, as compared to their European or North American counterparts, who have generally longer careers (e.g. Kaetlyn Osmond who won the Olympic bronze at the age of 22 and retired at 23 - the only Russian skater right now to be still in the circuit and be this 'old' is Tuktamysheva).
