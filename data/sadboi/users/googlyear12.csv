ptsd,fqmieye,t1_fqm6abe,1589477963.0,"I actually just got a link from the hospital i was at to fill out a survey. When i talked to my therapist she said that her behavior was unethical. Im just worried that because it was just the two of us in a room with nobody else that they wont believe me because i came in for a psych eval. And who are they more likely to believe, someone who had a psychotic break or someone whos seemingly perfect. But i dont want this woman to dk this to anybody else."

rapecounseling,fdfjnzu,t3_ekocr1,1578363275.0,Im currently experiencing the same thing and my anti depressants dont help the situation sexually at all. Currently ive just been getting drunk if i want to have sex but obviously this isnt a fix. Im mad too. I feel your pain and i am so sorry its like this.
ptsd,f88wmsu,t3_dz7956,1574362743.0,"Yes! Theres this book called Life, Reinvented by erin carpenter. Theres a section in there just for friends and loved ones but the whole book goes in depth on what ptsd is and how it works which i think makes ot helpful for not only your loved ones but also for us."
ptsd,f7ypv2x,t3_dy3w0c,1574098939.0,"A really good book i have is Life, Reinvented by Erin Carpenter. It goes into the science behind PTSD, a guide for both survivors and loved ones, and it talks about domestic violence and r*pe trauma."
