Also, he won't have debt from his program because they pay him to be in it. He also seems to have a lot of time whenever he wants to do something but most of the time he says he's busy whenever its something I ask him to do."

And I \*sometimes\* do chains, but I give treats for ""lay down"" since that's one he doesn't like to do. I mean, I can have him lay down or sit and will give him a treat then I might do another trick or have him repeat the trick and he will just stare at me even though I'm 100% certain he knows how to sit or lay down.

I usually have the treats in my pocket or on a counter and get one when he does it but he usually sees me put the treats there and if he doesn't then he sometimes does it but like 75% of the time he doesn't want to. 

I don't always reward with food. When I plan on taking him somewhere I have him wait at the door while I open it then say okay and his reward is the car ride. It's usually food though.

I try to switch up the order or tricks when I have him do multiple so he doesn't just think it's one big trick."

I'd also have to drop out of school meaning the last 4 years would have been a waste of time. I also have a tendency to get arrested when I'm drunk, so I would automatically go to jail since I'm on probation for the next 6 months.

After tracking my moods for a couple weeks I had another hypo episode where I got all paranoid so I went to a mental health urgent care clinic. I told them how I had been feeling for a few days and that I was depressed a few weeks before that and remembered having this kind of cycle before. I showed them my mood chart and they said that based on that and what i said that i could be bipolar so they prescribed me some meds and told me to see a psych.

I got really depressed and went to my campus counseling center and they made an emergency appointment with the campus psych. She said that I could be bipolar and changed my meds a little. I started seeing a regular psych and she said I was bipolar and I saw her for a few months. After being stable on meds for a little bit I started questioning my diagnosis and told my psych I wanted to stop taking meds and she said ok. 

So I was off meds for a few days months and was fine for a couple then started rapidly cycling and went to see a therapist and psychiatrist again. After a while they both told me they're pretty sure I'm bipolar and that I shouldn't come off of meds again."
