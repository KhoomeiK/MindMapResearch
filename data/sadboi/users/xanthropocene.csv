Climate change currently affects public health, waste management, urban planning, food production. 

In my province the agriculture sector lost something insane like $700 million in 2012 due to increase ice storms destroying crops. 

Extreme weather has increased. Disaster are become more frequently and more costly, but less deadly thanks to mitigation. This is why climate related mitigation is important. Governments spend millions per year in emergency management and those costs have increase. Agencys like FEMA and the EPA have expanded over the past decade to meet those demand.

If you're truly interested in understanding the complexities of climate change I suggest you do your own research from places that aren't opinion based.
