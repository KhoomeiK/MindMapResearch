It’s normal. You’re given basically a creature to tend to at its beck and call. No satisfaction. I read that when mothers breastfeed certain hormones are meant to go into effect that makes you feel love. I have yet to experience it. 


But, it gets better and now I am enjoying seeing the world through his eyes. Something I do daily could be life changing to him. It makes me value life a lot more."

My cat used to frequently go out into our yard and come back. It was late night, and I heard her hissing outside. I was the only one awake so I peeked out my window which faced the yard. I saw somebody staring back at me. I immediately ducked down and felt scared. After a few minutes I looked again. Still staring at the window. I assumed he didn’t see me since it was really dark in my room. 


Many years later it dawned on me, we often left the door open so our cat could come back in. If he wanted to. This guy could have easily gotten into our house. To this day I don’t know what he was doing there or what the intention was.
