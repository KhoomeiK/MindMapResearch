bipolar,flu3xe5,t1_fltp9ec,1585494664.0,"Of course; if there‚Äôs one thing we need the most, it‚Äôs knowing we aren‚Äôt alone and crazy. I‚Äôm still feeling this out. And starting on a new medication. And I‚Äôm trying to acclimate and accept the diagnosis amid this damn pandemic too. I really need to go back through my DBT course and start doing some CBT on my own too. I‚Äôm just too dang tired lol

Also I don‚Äôt know anyone else In real life who is bipolar either. It‚Äôs a whole new and scary place."
HelpMeFind,fltnhqy,t3_fr3wk0,1585480428.0,"You can make a crepe cake! And you could always make one in a dome shape (making them a little smaller as you stack them), then cut a hole in the center and put a Barbie legs down into it. Then decorate the cake with the candies. Happiest of birthdays to your baby girl. She will remember her mama doing magic to give her a birthday :) 

Another option is to make the crepe cake. then take a picture of Barbie, cover it in clear packing tape, then lay it on the cake. My kids loved when I did this for their cakes."

bipolar,fltmzrj,t3_fr3wty,1585479830.0,"I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed til our kids were 9/15.  If I was diagnosed earlier in my life, adoption would probably have been a bigger option. But I don‚Äôt regret having my babies. I work at staying healthy, active and commit to my medication and therapy *for them* ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt hide any of it (I mean, we are open with them to the point where it is age appropriate). I loved the experience of being pregnant as well (though one could surrogate and have the experience without potential genetic issues).  Is it ethical? I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs a hard question. But I understand not wanting your child to personally experience one freaking moment of this disorder. That‚Äôs a thought that never leaves my mind."

To my knowledge, as long as you don‚Äôt need respiratory help, most can just ride it out in their own isolated home."
