Alternatively, maybe try and use a specific sub-type of weapons. That can give your character a character trait- preference. Like a Mage who likes using Tomes and doesn't like Staffs because he believes that with Tomes you show your true power without external factors.  
Just thinking of a story for your world and character can go a long way.  
   
Finally, you can try and build the hardest-to-craft items in the game, like the Cell Phone or Ankh Shield. These 2 require items from most activities, from defeating enemies to buying from merchants and even fishing. So maybe that can help if you want to concentrate on experiencing as much as you can."

None of them have used a computer and they have ADMITTED IT. The freaking principle has too. That's because this school was for traditional art until they had to implement 3D modelling, knowing that people like me will bite the bait.  


Second: Offered help is useless when a person isn't looking for it. Otherwise there wouldn't have been grades lower than 4 in any school globally.

There are no better schools that have 3D modelling, but this one has it simply because it's part of an innovative program, not because they care. So people like me go there for the 3D modelling but instead are forced to draw humans and what not.  
I'm saying this because the reason I argue with my teachers about proportions is that in 3D modelling the things come out naturally. You just look at XYZ and do your shapes. You don't need proportions because they are there to begin with, but apparently I have to make them or it doesn't count.
