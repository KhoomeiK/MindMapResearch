AskReddit,es2b446,t3_c58940,1561518857.0,"Not feed me. I didn’t get breakfast until I was around 5 years d and it was a single offbrand pop tart. I got 3 peanut butter crackers (made with saltines) and 4 baby carrots for lunch every day. Even to take to school. Until I was 14 and I told my dad I didn’t want him to make me lunch anymore bc I got teased for it. He refused to sign the forms for free lunch. If we didn’t eat at my grandparents houses for dinner we would eat like a bagel and some breakfast sausage for dinner. Snacks were not a thing that I could have. . 
Now here’s the thing- this was not bc we were that poor that I couldn’t have food. We had money for food. My dad had cereal, he had milk, and chips and ice cream and cheese and things. I just wasn’t allowed to eat those things. Ever. If I drank any of “his” milk I’d get screamed at and spanked. He would weigh the cereal. I’m not kidding. It was a weird control thing, he just would not let me eat food. I weighed 97 pounds when I was 16. I am never ever ever doing that to a kid. I will be hungry before I let a kid go hungry. I’ve gone hungry to make sure my cat got food ffs. I am always hungry now I’m an adult and I can just eat and eat and eat and never feel full."

AskReddit,erfvchy,t3_c1qokc,1560818918.0,I don’t bc I’m an alcoholic. And I would like to not ruin my life.
AskReddit,eqo3h2v,t1_eqlve16,1560183629.0,"You can do it dude! I’m 45 days in on my sobriety, it is possible! Check out r/recovery if you need some support but don’t wanna tell your friends yet (which I get- not all of my friends know I’m in recovery yet- some of them would be like “But why?!?” So I just haven’t told them) Good luck and know a fellow recovering alcoholic is rooting for you."
AskReddit,eqo2345,t3_byqxiy,1560183105.0,"Fake beer or ginger ale, if the people in with are all drinking mixed drinks I just get the mixer plus soda, or if they get shots I do a “shot” of the chaser. I’m a recovering alcoholic so I don’t go to bars much but having something that looks like a drink keeps my friends from making a big fuss about it and I feel like I’m hanging out like a normal person. Plus who doesn’t like sparkly juice? There’s one bar that I’m friends with the bar tender (and it’s a fancy cocktail bar) and she makes me fancy mocktails that look super pretty and taste really good."

 Or here’s all my money plz let me go."
AskReddit,eoisp10,t1_eoirbfy,1558626520.0,"Also I dunno if this will help- but when I get a flashback what can pull me out of it is to recite to yourself the day, your current age and location and the year your in over and over to sort of reorient yourself in time. Ir helps me remember that I’m an adult not a kid, I’m safe in my own house, I’m not near my abuser, I just have to ride this out and it will be ok. My man has gotten really good at knowing my triggers too, and if I start a flashback (usually I start shaking and crying and get this weird stare bc it’s like I’m looking into the past at something that isn’t actually there but my brain thinks it is) and he will start me on the mantra “Random29girl it’s 2019, it’s ok, I’m not gonna hurt you just breath” and that helps a lot."
AskReddit,eoirbfy,t1_eoi9hux,1558625725.0,"Oh my god I’m not the only one!!! Childhood trama PTSD here, I had an awful flashback in an argument with my man and ended up panicking and crying in a corner trying to shield my face and head with my arms while begging not to be hit anymore and that I was sorry. My poor boyfriend felt so bad. He had slammed a door and yelled while walking toward me while waving his arms around. Brain broke. Thought I was nine again."
