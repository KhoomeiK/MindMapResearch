This ties back to JBP‚Äôs stance on truth. He defines truth as that which is useful. He sees Jung‚Äôs teachings as useful (they may very well be to some people) and therefore true. For the rest of the world, this is not how truth is defined. Thus Jung‚Äôs teachings can not be considered true because they have yet to be verified to match reality (something that perhaps should‚Äôve already happened were they to actually be true). 

Of course it‚Äôs useful to be aware of one‚Äôs negative sides. Does this mean we all have a shadow? No. Does it make more sense to talk in terms of a shadow than mere negative sides? Imo, no. Do we all have archetypes in us? Probably not. Those who say we do can go ahead and prove it, as this has yet to be done.

From the brain‚Äôs perspective this means that it doesn‚Äôt have to do anything about it, because it‚Äôs just another thought and thoughts come and go by themselves all the time. Oftentimes, it‚Äôs how we react to our thoughts that keeps them around, much like running from a wolf will cause it to chase you. If you can go into a mode where you hold the thoughts as just thoughts (may take some practice, preferably with neutral thoughts at first), there will be no reason for your brain to react to them and no reason for them to stick around.
