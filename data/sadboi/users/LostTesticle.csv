Jordan_Peterson_Memes,fh7x7px,t1_fh5bqnj,1581347036.0,"Jung’s teachings are not widely accepted in the psychological community, for many reasons, one being that they are not yet verified and perhaps even proven wrong. This ties back to JBP’s stance on truth. He defines truth as that which is useful. He sees Jung’s teachings as useful (they may very well be to some people) and therefore true. For the rest of the world, this is not how truth is defined. Thus Jung’s teachings can not be considered true because they have yet to be verified to match reality (something that perhaps should’ve already happened were they to actually be true). 

Of course it’s useful to be aware of one’s negative sides. Does this mean we all have a shadow? No. Does it make more sense to talk in terms of a shadow than mere negative sides? Imo, no. Do we all have archetypes in us? Probably not. Those who say we do can go ahead and prove it, as this has yet to be done. 

JBP isn’t very scientific despite him being a professor. This isn’t very surprising given him leaning towards the psychoanalytical side of psychology. Also his stance on Christianity and religion (remember his definition of truth)."

The trick to this is to start viewing the thoughts as something separate from *you*. From the brain’s perspective this means that it doesn’t have to do anything about it, because it’s just another thought and thoughts come and go by themselves all the time. Oftentimes, it’s how we react to our thoughts that keeps them around, much like running from a wolf will cause it to chase you. If you can go into a mode where you hold the thoughts as just thoughts (may take some practice, preferably with neutral thoughts at first), there will be no reason for your brain to react to them and no reason for them to stick around.

In your opinion, who bears the responsibility in the following situation: At the beach, women are wearing bikinis, skin is showing and sometimes even nipples are seen through.
