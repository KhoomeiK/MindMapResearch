nfl,fcj1t1z,t1_fchz36w,1577675154.0,"Part of the appeal to me as a Brit was learning about how the NFL functions was the massive focus on parity. I love Brit football too but our sport has no real attempt at parity. Sure, club m
and team management both matter. Facilities matter too. With enough money you can land world class staff and build those facilities though. You can also spend what you like on players if the funds are there, and there is no wage cap. Club reputation can be a limiter for smaller clubs, but again with enough cash you can always attract players, managers, staff, etc., who are above the level that club currently operates at, so they still improve.

The Draft system & salary cap kill that model, making it a much more even game. Of course its a different sport too, and that affects how it can operate. It works very well imo, making the game much more about players and coaching. Now Im getting more into it I see there are other influences too though, front office etc"

Ive been an athlete for most of my life since childhood. From ages 24-32 i was in combat sports, off periods were training 4-5 days a week, 60-90 mins per session. On periods were 5-6 days a week, often 2 a days. At 32 i retired, followed by a relationship break up which completely altered my life. I didnt train more than 3x a month for the last 18 months, and had done perhaps 1 a month most of this year. Am stoked to say that after 3 weeks of regular training ive noticed massive changes. Last month i struggled to run 3km at once, benched 40kg, and could do 15 press ups. After 7-8 sessions ive ran 10km without pause, got bench up to 60kg (i weigh 64-68kg usually), hammered 5 sets of 20 on the press ups, and look massively different. To me this means big improvements in cardio, strength and endurance with a max 3 sessions on any one area!

Never have i been so grateful to have put so much work in during the past. It feels like having a superpower and i hope it lasts forever!"

confidence,ev2zbus,t1_ev2ij1v,1564186389.0,"Ah, that should be standard really. Theyre humans too, they like pretty things and also get horny. My point of view is, thank god they dont get as obsessed by them as some men do! A good woman is much more than a pretty one, and some of the most beautiful ones become assholes because that beauty is overvalued by society and its conditioning (in my opinion).

So hey, at least they care about other stuff. Things that dont fade. Being funny, or caring, or just a shoulder to lean on. Maybe doing well career wise or getting into fitness. Not just to look good, but with real enthusiasm. This is why i suggest working on your strengths. Women love enthusiastic go getters because its a survival trait. This is why sometimes theyll go with way older guys and settle, or somebody not great looking, or overweight, or sick/infirm/poor/no family/socially awkward, etc etc.

Doesnt matter what you DONT have. If you focus on that, youre doomed. Show them what you DO have. Develop yourself so they see the value. Do it for you and theyll like it even more. Its like a sale. Believe in your value and convince them its there."
