Just calling it lazy is someones disinterest in helping them cope during the lapse of state. Alot of basic mental issues are disregarded by many even some that have them.

Rejection without explanation sucks, so getting your answer in the following week will spare you any deeper pain or future drama and issues.

dating_advice,fr0iv3e,t3_gly4us,1589797244.0,It's super fresh. It's normal to be insecure and feel out people. He might have been cheated on by the looks of his questions. Being polite and hosting people is fine also. Sounds like he likes you and gets rusty. Plus you guys should just talk...its all new for both of you so if your hating on him and hes afraid of asking for details then it might not work but hey at least you had fun.

survivinginfidelity,fqtydvs,t3_gkviak,1589648490.0,Trust me mate. The trust is just slowing deflating and the respect is next. Find yourself a new place and get out of that relationship. If she keep going on in the relationship like it was nothing and used that way and made excuses it's not worth a second more of your time. Shes hiding apart of herself which is also a big red flag. Just try your best to avoid her and be private about your life till you can get out.

survivinginfidelity,fqlcvd1,t1_fqlci5c,1589454271.0,"Yeah I feel that. Learning it, learning that woman you saw wasnt actually her completely, learning about all the steps that were taken behind your back, the conversations, the planning, then actual DDay and her (potential) thoughts and actions. Time helped me discover how to spot that state people go into when they are lying. It messed me up worse than the actual act itself. The damage was taking the blame and visualizing all the lies and deceit. I never got the truth, she vanished from my life one day before I turned 30 and I had 3 paintings I did for it her arrive at my doorstep. That memory will haunt me for the rest of my life and she thought in the moment it was empowering.....crazy to see how blind and unaware people are of how much damage they cause with cheating. Be strong mate, I know its gonna be hard for you but stick it out. Fall apart, try new things, change it up, try and find faith in people. It sucks big time I know....but you survived the cheater. You didnt do anything wrong."

I still took her back only to be called the bad guy, blamed for her cheating, blocked, number change, she would show up after hanging with her new friends at 3 am high on something looking for sex. She was very hurtful and disturbing. She even exclaimed that it was I that cannot be trusted because I'm always asking questions, the wrong questions and jesus Murphy did I buy into all that act."

But their allowed that's the game. So avoid the game completely.  That's what I did. I totally feel you on this and relate to this post whole heartedly. Being cheated on and lied to sucks. When I was cheated on I still took her back, but I was the liar in the end and I was lying to myself. I had no respect left for her and was mean and a jerk.

survivinginfidelity,fql8prn,t3_gjexiu,1589450206.0,"I get flashbacks, super random triggers, nightmares.

Dont do it. 3 months is way to long to discover how cheating is really damaging and trust me man, the trust will never comeback. Shes also likely to do it again. Shes in the past, keep it that way and save yourself another irreversible moment of emotional pain. She is the example of bad news. Btw it's been 5 years since dday for me and I still haven't forgotten, that shit haunts me. Cheating is bad news."
