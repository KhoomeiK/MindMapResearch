also you can keep them in your pocket if you want when they are little to keep them warm. or i usually get a hot water bottle and (not so hot tho) put the baby possum in a beanie hat ontop to simulate the pouch and she will be comfortable. and you can cuddle the beanie hat to keep her warm too. or place the hat on a low heat electric blanket."

AskReddit,ffg3xzc,t3_etg2n9,1579897932.0,"i will start. one summer day i was sitting outside and on that day hundreds of beetles come out of the ground on the lawn. 

my indoor cat come out to sit in the sun. 
he walked out onto the grass not noticing all the beetles around him. he got a good 3 feet from the house onto the grass and sat down to notice some beetles in-front of him. 
he was entertained. at first. 
then 
he saw how many beetles there was around him. he jumped up made an alarmed noise and looked absolutely disgusted by all the crawling beetles all around him. 
he then just made a dash for the house. he went inside and shuddered. 

anyway thatâ€™s the story that comes to mind for me. what about you?"
