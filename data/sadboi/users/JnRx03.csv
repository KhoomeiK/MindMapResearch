Seems like it's easy to just get caught in the 9-5 with an easy job, and a nice little paycheck, I've been there, i'm still there. 

But on the brightside, you're 37, not dead, you can still go back to either college or a trade school and find a much higher paying skill that'll satisfy you personally, and keep you a float 

Not to mention you have a fiance, so the life life seems to be going great. I think you just have to change your perspective, you're almost 40, you're more mature and focused and you have tons of experience, that's valuable."

buildapcsales,fq5mnak,t1_fq50ir0,1589111059.0,As of right now. If you're looking for a good 144hz IPS 1080p monitor the meta is either the AOC 24G2 or the ASUS VG249QR with the latter being easier to find as it pops up more often.
buildapcsales,fq555n4,t1_fq50g5q,1589092852.0,"Please stop misleading people, do some research first. Response time (1-5+ ms) refers to how long a pixel takes to turn from one shad of grey to another or gtg, it has NOTHING to do with input lag.   


When a monitor takes too long to change from one shade to another you get ""ghosting"" which is where you still see the original image after movement has occurred in the picture like a...ghost.   


Most advertising intentionally seems to purposely conflate response times with input lag to take advantage of people who want the ""fastest"" monitor since it response time and input lag do sound similar."

But as I said before. The panels are both the same one just had a better stand and wider color gambit.  So one isn't better than the other unless you're specifically looking for a stand and slightly better color gambit.

I was wondering why my other post were getting downvoted but I realize upon clicking your link you were showing the AOC monitor.

So to summarize. Same panel, different stands, slightly more saturated colors on the AOC."
