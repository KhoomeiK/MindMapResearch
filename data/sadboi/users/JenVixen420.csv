I developed massive tumors, lived in constant pain. Getting my hysterectomy/removing 5lbs of fibroids last year changed my entire life. Endometriosis is horrifying. My self worth was destroyed due to my disease process. Check for any underlying autoimmune disease. Find a super supportive OB/GYN. Help with pain management/nausea/any symptoms related to her suffering. In my opinion this is crucial for survival and being able to make it to surgery if needed.

Mental health care I cannot stress enough here. Watching others be excited/have children and living with infertility is devastating emotionally. People say some suuuper cruel shit. 

My parents dipped as soon as they found out no grandchildren would ever come from me. She's a beautiful soul that deserves love,  no matter her abilities to carry a pregnancy.
