Old clothes become rags, hair bows, bags for groceries.

I really do think you can just repurpose those forever 21 clothes and other cheap clothing you used to have instead of buying expensive and sustainable clothing.

My grandmother constantly falls or does strenuous things during odd times like at 3 am when we are all asleep so we are not aware of the accidents she makes. Besides injuring herself, she also has the habit of peeing in corners of the room and other areas of the floor. We cannot detect where she peed the next day but simply that she did because of the smell. 
Due to all of this, constant surveillance seems reasonable. You cannot rely on someone who has Alzheimer‚Äôs to tell you what happened because of the disease. Often, when we ask her how she got the injury and where in order to appropriately treat her wounds she would say that large men attacked her which we know isn‚Äôt the case. When and where peeing occurred can‚Äôt be asked either. 
She‚Äôs in her late stages I believe so maybe the situation is a little different."
