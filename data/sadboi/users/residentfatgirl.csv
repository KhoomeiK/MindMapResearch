depression,fqw5a6q,t1_fqw1uvk,1589693252.0,"So there is something called adipex that you can only get from your doctor. I took it in 2 rounds last year and lost 60 pounds. It basically kills your appetite and gives you an energy boost. I was definitely an over eater and an emotional eater. Once my appetite was gone, and I realized I didn't NEED to eat, the w e.r ight just fell off. I didn't change what I was eating at all, I only changed the portions. With that being said, I think a combo of speaking to a mental health professional along with this medication is the best route. I still find myself sometimes eating because I'm bored and I have to consciously will myself to stop. I also stopped drinking pop and instead of eating fast food once a week or once every 2 weeks, I try to only eat it once a month. Although if I'm really craving a pop I will have one because denying cravings is the quickest way to ruin a change in diet. Hope this helps!"

mentalhealth,fqw0pg0,t3_gl8wp4,1589689689.0,"Hi there ðŸ™‚
Your post really resonated with me because when I turned 20, I began to panic about being alone so I literally married the person I had been seeing for less than a year at the time. Surprise surprise, it didn't work out. At 23 you aren't even fully you yet. There are so many experiences still waiting for you that are going to shape your idea of the relationship that you want. Personally, I had to come to terms with being single ""forever "" before I was able to really refine the relationship that I want with anyone else. The situation you are in with your girlfriend is unfortunate and I'm sorry you are going through this but life is too short to be arguing with anyone 5 or 6 days a week. It sounds like she is considering the possibility of being with this other guy and you should consider just breaking things off. I know.... easier said than done. Heartbreak is something we all risk to be in love and as painful as it is, it also helps is grow. You both need the space to grow. Furthermore, just because you think you are ""below average"" as it pertains to your looks doesn't make it true. We are always our own worst enemies and it's impossible for us to read anyone else's mind. I don't know if any of this was helpful because no words are going to heal a broken heart but please think about what I have said here. You are already a whole person and when you realize that, someone else will come along that is also whole on their own and that shared wholeness will be so complimentary to each of you."
mentalhealth,fhavqvm,t3_f21lg0,1581428385.0,"In my opinion, your parents are not doing their job and that sucks. They are invalidating the emotions related to your assault and that isn't helpful. When I was 17, I was sexually assaulted but too embarrassed to tell my parents. At the time I was going to a catholic school and decided to tell the priest in the sacrament of reconciliation because what is said during that time is confidential. I knew he couldn't tell anyone else and that helped me to feel a little better. I am agnostic at best now but if you are religious, maybe you should talk to a person in your faith that you trust. Have you told any of your friends?"

TrueCrimeDiscussion,fbjudrj,t1_fbjjjpc,1576940187.0,"From the article, it sounds like he was offering these things in exchange for sex with ""exchange"" being the key word. That turns it into prostitution which is illegal. Had he never mentioned the gift cards or offering to fill up gas tanks, and instead just did it after as like a ""hey go get yourself some Arby's because you look hungry"" he would have been in the clear. Although having sex with a student at the college he teaches at isn't a good look."
scarystories,f9ge48r,t1_f9gcysn,1575297850.0,"Well if you had read my response to her, you would have seen that I encouraged her to keep a journal with the dates and times of any incident, including the original encounter. That way, when she is ready to make a report, she has established a pattern of behavior. I also told her that my brother is a police officer and if she wants, I'll put her in contact with him anonymously so he can walk her through the process of filing a complaint. She might be more willing to go to the police, above her mom, if she knows what the process entails."
scarystories,f9g9zyz,t1_f9g71ed,1575295926.0,"Wow Chad, you sound upset. Take a few breaths and calm down. I never said she should ignore the situation. She told her mom and her grandma and got exactly no where with those efforts. Maybe you should hop on over to me direct response to the op instead of drawing your own conclusions about what I am saying. I am glad you understood the reference to the Gillette commercial though. If I'm being honest, I didn't think you would get it. Part of toxic masculinity is making statements to victims such as, ""if you don't say anything, more bad stuff will happen."" You have no idea what this child is going through so I don't think the most helpful advice is making her feel responsible for someone else's sick actions."
scarystories,f9g2zzs,t1_f9g22x4,1575292413.0,"I knew I'd be talking to a brick wall when I read your first comment. It's relevant to the op because, once again, you were putting it on her shoulders to speak up even though she is clearly not comfortable. Whether she speaks up or not, she has no blame in this situation. So to sum up, neither the OP or your girlfriend bare any responsibility over their respective issues. I think you need to watch that famous Gillette commercial a few thousand times, Chad."

I don't care how many times you say ""dont respond"". Just like the wicked witch of the west, you have no powers here. Second, you said it kept happening because SHE didn't say anything. She was a child and bears zero responsibility. I'm not trying to start any fight. I saw an opportunity to educate you and let you know that your own words are placing blame on your girlfriend, whether you understand how they are or not. Third, I am uneducated? You can't even construct a grammatically correct statement. In closing, I still feel bad for your girlfriend."

You deserve so much more than that. Please hang in there and know that you are worthy of love. Pretty soon you will be able to leave all of that behind and you can choose the relationships and people you want in your life. I agree with other responders as far as the counseling goes. Reach out to your school counselor and when you are older, continue to see a professional that will give you the tools you need to close that chapter of your life."
scarystories,f9f82rh,t3_e4jk9v,1575262136.0,"I agree with everything that is being said here. This sounds like a very dangerous situation and the fact that he sits in your driveway is unnerving to say the very least. I have a kid around your age and if she told me that someone was playing with themselves while watching her, the cops would be called to a homicide because I would kill that individual. The reaction you got from your parents is troubling. I don't want to jump to conclusions because not everyone who drinks has a drinking problem but maybe you aren't in the best environment to begin with. Have you talked to any aunts, uncles, or grandparents about this? If the adults that are supposed to protect you aren't doing their job, then you need help from somewhere else. Please keep a little journal of every incident that occurs. It helps establish a pattern for when you are ready to file a report. As far as your friend is concerned, she sounds like she isn't a very good friend. I know that friendships are important but not all friends are meant to stay in our lives. This entire situation is very serious. My brother is a police officer so if you need help or advice, let me know,and I'll get you into contact with him anonymously. We don't live in the same state so he would have no jurisdiction but he could help talk you through the process. Stay safe little one."

Honestly, you probably have the same information that any person not directly involved with this case has which doesn't necessarily increase the validity of your ""research"". This case is at best suspicious. That's all I'm going to say because I also did not work on it. It could have been an accident, it could have been murder."
