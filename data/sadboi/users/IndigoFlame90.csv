If you're a five star facility it's only Med A on day/swing, they eventually get a new ice machine after a year of breakdowns, alllll the calmo you want as long you you personally request a reorder (b/c the other nurses' fingers are broken?), and there is a long-suffering (and one of my favorite people there) nurse in her seventies who gets running a six-week CNA class added to her usual responsibilities a few times a year so we get infusions of fresh victims from that."

Like when the roads are impassable from ice or when a coworker (recently diagnosed with Bipolar 1 w/ psychotic features in a massive clusterfuck) got a phone call from his wife like ten minutes before he would have ridden his bike home  say that she was across town (he wasn't yet driving again).

It was a weird Thanksgiving. My mom was sort-of-but-not boycotting her family's b/c her sister's kids weren't failures and this took place en route to my dad sister's where I had the best thing I ever eaten, a turkey my cousin's husband had marinated in white wine and cooked for 21 hours.

Really, at the time it was was at least better than not taking it. The real mindfuck was **not** taking it. My mom forgot (For several consecutive days. You have ONE KID) to send it to me at college.

And then potassium for the diuretic). It was the first 'bipolar' drug I took (I cross-titrated with fluoxetine) when I was 22. Helped me in all of the ways that an SSRI/SNRI never could (I came to the realization that I was no longer being told that I was speaking too loudly/rapidly before I was aware those were were even bipolar symptoms). Added lithium about five years later but if I had to pick one to keep it would be the lamotrigine. For anyone curious, 600 mg of the lamotrigine and 900 mg of lithium, but I'm someone whose meds stay about the same and the doses slowly creep upwards (in conjunction with blood work, of course)."
