lingling40hrs,fmaj7ah,t1_fmaizrs,1585895966.0,It's only worth it if you count on watching the master classes quite seriously^^ 200$ is definitely an investment^^ but having watched multiple classes there I found it great and a good complement to my regular classes (both for violin and business) ^^ tell me if you end up getting it!

lonely,fjcre6m,t1_fjbz0p3,1583233505.0,"Being isolated is really hard! I fully understand ! After I moved to South Korea from France I needed to rebuild my entire life and friendships, but it's hard to make friends on a deeper level when we don't speak the same mother tongue! I just want you to know it's possible to get out of that isolation ! 
Try joining a group for an activity you like (music, art, sports) there's always that one super friendly person that will come towards you and you'll naturally make friends/meet people with the same passion as you ! 

I know you can do it ! I believe in you both !"

If you really feel lonely try joining a group that does an activity you like (hiking, painting, music etc...) You'll naturally make friends that share your passion! 
Good luck I believe in you or as they say in Korea: Fighting (ÌôîÏù¥ÌåÖ) !"

fuckeatingdisorders,fh9xfaf,t3_f1sc5a,1581391857.0,"Yes, 100% see a doctor, by what you are saying I'm afraid it's not only bulimia but a physical condition as well.   
Having gone through Bulimia for 4 years and being ""clean"" for 2 years now, I can definitely tell you ""random"" throw up is not a part of Bulimia. If you need support with your Bulimic episodes feel free to DM me, I really want to help other people going through this!"
fuckeatingdisorders,fh9x0j9,t3_f1zk3z,1581391575.0,"Hey! I want you to know you are not alone! The fact that you are conscious that you do this is already a massive step towards recovery! It took me moving across the world to realize that I was doing something wrong.  

I went through the exact same thing about 5 years ago and did it for nearly 4 years, this is how I finally made it out of what I now know was Bulimia:

\- First: completely stop weighing yourself, Numbers are your worse enemy 

\- Second: try pilates, yoga, stretching, skating (this is by far the most expensive option but worked miracles for me starting to appreciate my body), or ballet. Generally speaking, sports that mix flexibility and strength. Which avoids having your muscles gaining volume but nevertheless burn fat.

\-Third: don't diet, this might seems like the weirdest advice, but don't just stop eating the stuff you love, eat what you love and serve them in smaller plates (tricks your brain in thinking you ate more than you actually did), and if you feel like cookies, candies, chocolate do eat some (just don't overdo it), if you try to cut out all the things you like, you'll get cravings and then that's when you are like to just eat a ton of them.

\- Four: I don't know if generally speaking you drink sodas and carbonated drinks. If you do that is the main source of sugar you should cut out or at least limit.

\-Five: Keep track of your mental state in a journal, keep track of how often you throw up and of what you eat. (if you see a specific food/throw up pattern 100% see a doctor, you might have an allergy which would make you throw up regardless of how much you eat)

Off the top of my head, I'm not sure what more advice I can give you, Just know you can always feel safe in DMing me if you need to talk about it! 

Good luck! Or as they would say in Korea - Fighting!"
lingling40hrs,fgzc2ns,t1_fgyft3d,1581192810.0,"Sure ! Cello version of czardas is great, Cello Concertos (generally speaking), I love the Unaccompanied cello suites- N1 G major, N3 Cmajor etc... (played by yoyoma), sicilienne Faure (played by cello and piano), Vocalise Rachmaninov.
And I have an absolute love for ballet music especially Dance of the knights Prokoviev but that's more orchestral"
lingling40hrs,fgvqto7,t3_f0mbt9,1581151966.0,"Maybe you could try new fun stuff with your instrument, either 

\-Play a piece you love listening too and puts you in a good mood (any kind of song/piece really) Like your happy piece, my personal happy pieces are most of Mary Poppins OSTs 

\- Give yourself a fun motivator/challenge (lingling challenge style, or a piece of chocolate/ candy cake for every XYZ that you do) 

\- Play with friends (regardless of their instruments)  and have a good laugh, exchange instruments with them and try the ""learn  in an hour kind of challenge thing \^\^)

Good Luck !"
lingling40hrs,fgvnnyr,t3_f0lhyx,1581151048.0,"Try listening to Cello concertos, pieces in general, they are a lot softer on the ears and do not require a 'Ling-Ling / Hilary Hahn' level to be nice to listen to. Could give you a bit of a break from violin while still listening to classical music (i went through a similar phase with flute/piccolo and violin) I ended up listening more to alto and bass flute pieces, as well as cello and it, definitely helps. I still love practicing both Flute and Violin though \^"

Please don't cut it ! What you can do is hairstyle it to look like a shorter hair cut, just practice thoroughly with YouTube tutorials there are a ton out there. 
If your hair is bra strap lenght you can definitely do these tuck under styles , maybe this could be the Compromise ?

Flute,f1uizz4,t3_daowuf,1569759476.0,"There are multiple reasons why you keep the right pinky down, first especially as a beginner it helps you hold and balance your flute properly, second sound is cleaner with that pinky down but that you only notice above a certain level. Finally, tone, if the pinky isn't down you will most likely be a bit out of tune unless you already learned how to  ""fine-tune"" with your air :) I hope this answers your question :)"
