Hungergames,fqyvqui,t1_fqyljvn,1589755381.0,"I got excited briefly in Catching Fire on the “Commander Thread, welcome to District 12—“ (SACKED) scene thinking they would have done something as I feel the making of Katniss’s friends and acquaintances into avoxes was a huge part on the mental warfare Snow deployed against her. Snow threw more at her in the books than in the movies. So much more mental torture than the movies even really showed."

I always told my husband I think calling each other daddy or momma or whatever appalled me if used in a flirty or sexual nature since it’s like a fad to call your main male SO “daddy” but I’ve always found it disgusting and now he knows why it sickens me more. He was disgusted and doesn’t use such language in that manner.

Well, he is deceased, now, and I bet she has found exactly what I was talking about amongst his things and in his computer history, but of course she would never fess up."
HIM,fpvu9xe,t1_fpvtzaf,1588951952.0,Many didn’t. Idk wtf their issue was. HIM is notorious for being able to keep their style while also changing their sound. I don’t think there’s a single HIM song I’d skip if they’re all playing on a single playlist.

My anime “husbando” is Korosensei because he’s my absolute favorite male anime character. There is so much substance and so much heart to his story. The man was the most dangerous person on earth (for the most part) and was cold hearted and tho his danger level increases exponentially, you see how he repented and just grew into such a loveable figure.... shit, I’m getting the sad again.... I can’t even listen to some songs anymore and even the word “Sakura” (despite me loving cherry blossoms) can sometimes make me sad. I feel weird and pitiful sometimes being so  sad over an anime character but I put time into watching all the episodes and I’ve seen people just as invested in things like game of thrones, so why would this be any different?"
Korosensei,fp9o9xa,t3_gc5wqa,1588431008.0,"Honestly, you’ll never fully heal. Might be extreme to say this but you may hold the death of Korosensei like the death of someone you know. The character of Korosensei is one that is easy to just love overwhelmingly. There will always be a pang in your heart when you think of something that reminds you of him. But it will get easier. I finished it almost 2 years ago and if I see the death clip on YouTube, I still cry. Just hang in there."
