I personally believe that some of the greatest art comes from the darkest places, but that's just me.  I feel like we live in a society that still believes it's taboo to demonstrate/illustrate/exhibit suffering for fear of judgment, which is crazy because all of us, in some shape or form, experience suffering at some point in our lives.  I have the utmost respect for people who step outside of traditional social norms and basically say, here it is or here I am.  It will definitely evoke a visceral, emotional reaction, especially amongst those who have been there, although they might not come right out and say it.  But that's okay.

What I do in day-to-day practice is really where the fun is, and what I believe would capture the attention of a larger audience around the world, but it would be drifting from 'becoming a psychologist' to 'being a psychologist,' which could work, now that I think about.  I could still make make the Q&A videos from time to time.  I am definitely going to check out the videos you suggested, thank you for taking the time to share them.

The fact that you added Fitness Pal to the screen and used markers for your tips.  Given that the vid is quite long, you could list your tips in your description with the time markers.

I also might add a link to Fitness Pal in the description, but that's a personal decision.  

The first thing that came to my mind when I saw your thumbnail and title was gastric bypass.  Clearly, that's not the case, but I think making it clear you achieved this amazing accomplishment through diet and exercise, NOT surgery, may be compelling to people.

I'm literally sitting on the floor filming on my iPhone, lol.  During my early videos, someone commented on how poor the audio was and sent me a link to a cheap microphone, which I got.  I don't have any lighting gear, so I time my filming for when the sun is brightest in my apartment, hahah.  The difference between the angles in the two videos was not on purpose, just how I set up my mini tripod.  I'm actually moving in a few days, so that will be the last time I film here.   I think lights will be my next splurge if/when I have one.   

I will definitely work on my posture and speech, as well as eye contact.  You should see my first videos, lol, I'm all over the place.  :)  I'm somewhat quirky IRL, so it's hard (but great practice) for me to be serious on camera.  Extremely helpful tips, thank you so much!!

I really liked the sound, too.  The female's voice was perfect, which could have thrown the entire thing off, the music was present, but not too distracting, although I wouldn't associate it with anxiety (more like depression), and the sound of the water in the shower.  

I apologize, but I was not a huge fan of the cinematic effects.  The colors were too much for me, and I wouldn't have watched it for very long under normal circumstances.  While I fully respect and appreciate that it's art, they were too bright.  Again, I might not associate that with anxiety, but more like a psychosis in that a person's perception of reality is completely distorted, if that makes any sense.

ForensicPsychologists,fiw6ra6,t1_fivp8r6,1582776583.0,"While I don't have experience in forensic science, like working crime scenes with dead bodies, blood, guts, etc., I can say that we don't have that level of intensity/exposure in forensic psychology.  If you're working with patients who have been charged with violent criminal offenses, which is frequently the case in forensic hospitals, there may be photographs of the crime scene, as well as descriptive reports on the details of the crime, autopsy, police reports, etc.  That said, the people we work with are still alive, and they are the ones who have committed these crimes.

Being able to work with people who have committed some pretty horrific crimes is one of the most important things to consider.  Can you handle working with a person who has abused, molested, raped, or murdered children?  Can you work with a person who has butchered his entire family, then set them on fire?  When I ask if you can work with these types of people, I mean can you put aside your personal feelings about what these people have done and provide them with the same level of care that you would for a person who has never gotten into legal trouble?  We provide the same standard of care to all patients, regardless of their past or current crimes, which can be hard for many people to do.

If you, a family member, loved one, close friend, etc. has been the victim of a crime, it's important to address any feelings or issues that may come up.  As I mentioned in another post on this sub, a trauma history, mental illness, or history of addition, among other things, aren't necessarily dealbreakers, but these are things that should be addressed and managed prior to entering the field.  As an example, if a person's sister was raped and murdered by someone, chances are high that this could come up in that person's work, especially when working with murderers, and possibly more so if the circumstances of the crimes are similar.  We may have a bias, and this bias may be negative or it could resemble overcompensation for said bias.  By this, I mean, while you may recognize you have a negative bias towards murderers, you may treat them differently (e.g., most likely better/more lenient) in order to compensate for the negative feelings you may harbor.  Life happens, bad things happen, we all experience trauma, but being proactive in acknowledging, identifying, addressing, and managing these feelings/emotions/reactions is key.  You have to be self-aware and open to dealing with anything that may come up.  Of course, there are other areas within forensic psychology that are not criminal, but as I mentioned earlier, they do involve the legal system.  Once you gain more knowledge and experience, you can start to find your niche.

Now, here's where people start to reconsider their pursuit of becoming a forensic psychologist.  SCHOOL.  FINANCES.  TIME.  I won't go too much into detail about these potential deterrents, but they are definitely important things to consider.

SCHOOL:  You definitely need to like school.  I realize you're still in high school, and college isn't the same or as much fun as grad school, but you're going to be in school for a good bit of time.

FINANCES:  Graduate school can be extremely expensive.  Also, at the end, you won't be super loaded, but you can live comfortably.  If you rely on student loans, things might be more tight, but if you attend fully funded programs, that's awesome!

TIME:  If you're still in high school, you're looking at more than a decade more of schooling to become a doctoral level forensic psychologist.  You will make a lot of sacrifices, some of which may be relationships with friends/partners/etc., but you have to weigh those against the achievement of your professional career goals.  The primary focus of your life will, more than likely, be about school and that degree.  Of course, if you have a family/kids, they are important, too, but they should know that you will have to sacrifice time spending with them on your work.  There will never be enough time in the day.

Real talk, this is a challenging and difficult, yet fascinating and extremely rewarding field.  Once you get through it, the majority of people will say it was worth it.  As someone who has been there, done that...and I still have one more obstacle to tackle....it has been and will continue to be worth it!  I LOVE what I do, I LOVE the challenge, I LOVE helping people in society who are ignored/dismissed/silenced because they are sick, I LOVE educating anyone who is interested and/or will listen to the importance of this work, and I LOVE knowing that I have the ability to effect change in the lives of my patients, as well as society as a whole."
ForensicPsychologists,fivogjl,t3_f9h6fm,1582764552.0,"It's fantastic that you have an idea about what you may want to pursue as a career, especially when you're in high school!  

While forensic science and forensic psychology sound extremely similar, they are different fields.  Forensic scientists deal more with crime scenes, and forensic psychologists are more involved with answering specific legal questions from a psychological framework.  Both fields are involved in the judicial process, though.  

Which field are you most interested in pursuing?"

John Jay has a great reputation, and I've worked with psychologists who have graduated from there.  I'm familiar with GW in terms of its Psy.D. program, which is really good, as well as the DC area.

I'm not sure how it works with state law enforcement, but from my experience with federal law enforcement, I just had to disclose the therapists/doctors I'd seen within the last 7 years, and they had to complete a form stating that I was fit to work in that position.  They also wanted to know if I had any psychiatric hospitalizations.  I don't think that has ever been asked for any state gov position I've had.  With any position (state or federal), you'll, of course, be drug tested, and there will be a background check, but as long as you don't try to hide anything, you should be good to go."
ForensicPsychologists,fhfuo5e,t1_fhdqghw,1581551715.0,"Great question, and it's one that is thought about much more than asked.  To answer your question simply, absolutely not.  Suffering from a mental illness, having a history of addiction, and/or seeking therapy are definitely not dealbreakers when it comes to becoming a psychologist.  I've been to therapy myself, and that has never been an issue.  In fact, seeking therapy is frequently encouraged, especially if you've got something going on in your life.

Of course, if a person with a mental illness that isn't being properly managed (with therapy and/or medication) or is in the midst of an active addiction, that can definitely interfere with a person's ability to function at work, regardless of his or profession.  A lot of patients prefer to work with someone who has been there or, more or less, ""gets it.""  There's something to be said when a person has 'life experience,' and hasn't just read about things in a textbook.  

In terms of working full-time while pursuing a doctorate in psychology, I wouldn't say it can't be done, although I'm not sure if many would advise it.  I can't remember if my program had a rule against working full-time, but I know lots of people worked.  I personally did not work, it would have been too much for me.  The people who worked did great, though.  Depending on the hours a job requires, and if those hours are flexible, it may or may not be easy to schedule classes around them.  In my program, almost all of my classes were scheduled during the day, and there were only a couple sections for each course.  Also, during my first two years, I had very little flexibility about what courses I could take, as they were all pretty much set by the program.  After that, we had bit more flexibility, which was somewhat determined by the electives we were allowed to take.  I would say working a 9-5 job and going to school full-time would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, but that could vary by program."

If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask."
ForensicPsychologists,fgukbnv,t1_fguebjz,1581122946.0,"This is actually an excellent question, and it's a question that comes up quite often.  This is something that is discussed when the issue of criminal responsibility comes into play.  You have probably heard the term ""Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity.""  The phrasing may differ by state, but it can also be referred to as mental status at the time of the crime.       

People commit crimes for all sorts of reasons.  Some of these perpetrators may suffer from mental illness, while others may not.  Like you said, there are people out there who commit some of the most heinous, horrific crimes, and there's nothing psychologically (or clinically diagnosable) wrong with them.  

When we think of mental illness in general terms, the anxieties (GAD, social anxiety, panic disorder, etc), the depressions (persistent depressive disorder, MDD, etc), the phobias, ADHD, etc., those aren't the illnesses that come up when a triple murder happens.  Of course, the perpetrators of multiple homicides may suffer from some of these conditions, but these illnesses do not diminish a person's capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong.  

While not everyone who suffers from a psychotic disorder has a propensity for violence, when it happens, one of the important things to assess is the content of a person's delusions to the extent that they contributed to his or her behavior.  By psychotic disorder, I'm referring to schizophrenia, schizoaffective, delusional disorders, some of the bipolar disorders accompanied by psychotic features, etc.  When I say delusion, just in case you or anyone else who might read this are not familiar, I'm talking about a firmly held belief that is inflexible and extremely difficult to change, despite the presence of evidence to suggest otherwise.  That said, just because a person may be psychotic, that still does not necessarily mean his or her psychosis was a factor in the commission of a crime.  

When a person's mental status at the time of the crime is so diseased or defected that he or she cannot conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law, it is that disease (or mental illness) that renders a person not criminally responsible.  The perpetrator does not intentionally or willfully mean to commit those crimes, and has no understanding of what he or she is doing.  This is a very difficult answer to determine, and it takes a very skilled forensic psychologist to successfully extrapolate the critical/essential data to answer this question, especially when it will be scrutinized in a Court of law.  This is why so few pleas of Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity are successful.  

In the Slenderman case, one of the young perpetrators was found not guilty by reason of mental disease.  I didn't follow that case closely, but this would be a successful example of that.  I know the question of insanity was raised in the James Holmes case, the guy who shot up the movie theatre at the Batman movie, and it was rejected by the jury.  Holmes had clearly planned out the attack, along with many other measures, which is not something someone who doesn't know that what they are doing is wrong will do.  Clearly, there was something with this guy, but was it his mental illness?  According to the forensic evaluator, as well as the jury that was presented with all of the data, no.  

Being mentally ill does not predispose a person to a life of crime or violence.  Other factors, such as a poor upbringing, exposure to violence in the home or on the streets, experiencing extreme physical/mental/emotional/sexual abuse, etc., may be taken into consideration, but there are plenty of people who come out of these situations who never engage in criminal activity.  There are also those who were born with silver spoons, and end up being career criminals with extremely violent behavior.  

It's fascinating to think about what leads people down certain paths.  

I'm not sure if this fully answers your question.  It was a great question, though!!  Definitely pertinent to all-things-forensic-psychology!!"

In my the line of work, I've encountered sooooo many situations and events that have made me question what type of God could/would allow these things to happen.

When I would ask other people these questions, I was never satisfied with the answers I'd get.  At the end of the day, I don't know if an answer that I could fully wrap my brain around even exists.  I just have to accept the fact that there are things that happen far outside of my ability to understand or control.  That there is nothing I can do or say that will make people believe otherwise.

I haven't always been as tolerant as I am today.  I'm a psychologist, and cultural sensitivity and working with diverse populations was really ingrained in me during grad school.

I actually pulled the text out somewhat recently because someone on this sub asked a question about necrophilia.  There was barely any information on it.  While it's definitely uncommon, I imagine a lot of necrophiliacs go unnoticed because it's not like their victims(?) report it...they're dead.  I don't know if there is an underground community or if it's even discussed amongst themselves.  Probably, but who knows?  Interesting question, though.  It made me think.  I wish I could have come up with a better answer for you."
morbidquestions,fg84olj,t1_fg82joi,1580609450.0,"I've worked in multiple prisons, and murderers, more often than not, have status.  If they were raping and killing children before murdering them, that's a little different.  Violence is not necessarily frowned upon in prison.  In fact, it's frequently encouraged.  Of course, the security level and other circumstances would factor in, but not necessarily if someone's reputation were at stake, a debt went unpaid, being disrespected, etc.

I don't think there is any scientific research that would be able to accurately answer your question, as the necrophiliac population is super small.  I'm not comfortable saying anything with any specificity because we simply don't have the data, and since I have not worked with any confirmed necrophiliacs, I don't have very much insight into how they think.  I would venture to say there might be less stigma, but it could very much be an individual thing.  A person's past experiences may influence their feelings about it.  If someone is having sex with dead people, I find it somewhat harder to believe that this person would have any moral judgments against others for doing the same thing, albeit with a minor.  People could, though."

Something you might experience may or may not be as or more traumatizing to someone else, if at all.  There are also different levels and types of trauma.  Regarding psychological trauma, I'm more inclined to say it is possible to self-induce than not.  As someone else mentioned, viewing graphic materials online could do it, if you're wanting to traumatize yourself.  Traumatizing someone else who wants to be traumatized could be traumatic for both.  I've worked with perpetrator-induced trauma, and it's very real.  While their intent wasn't to traumatize themselves, their intentional actions against other people, like involuntary manslaughter stemming from a punch that resulted in death, was traumatizing."

In your question, the two populations (or communities) you're trying to extrapolate from are very different: the necrophiliac community and the general population.  As a member of the necrophiliac community, I imagine a person may be more accepting of engaging in sexual acts with corpses of any age than a person from the general population would be concerning pedophilia.

I don't want to assume, but from what you shared about your patient, his behavior seems like may be on the younger side?  Whatever his age, I'd try not to infantilize him while reaching out, be it through phone, email, or text, apologize for the oversight, and ask how he feels about coming in for a final session to discuss what happened.  He was clearly looking for something from you that you didn't give him.  I'm not one for pushing/pressuring patients, but I think reaching out would be appropriate.  If he says no, respect his wishes.  If he accepts, I'd hear him out and be humble.  If he decides to resume therapy, I'd make a mental note to check to see if he's out there waiting, as he might try it again.  You're in a tricky situation, but it also sounds like he could really benefit from therapy, which is why I'd be a bit more proactive than I otherwise might be.  I'm an outsider looking in, though, so you will obviously know what's best."

I can't say that I've been in your situation, as my patients have essentially all been mandated to see me for treatment, but your patient's behavior/reaction is interesting.  Obviously, he was testing you, which you know, but do you know why he might have been testing you?

Your patient abruptly ending therapy with a doorknob confession (I forgot the correct term) at the close of your session may also be a test.  A test to see if you reach out, apologize, and ask if he will reconsider resuming therapy.  It sounds like he has a hard time trusting people, and he was hurt by what he perceived to be abandonment, perhaps?

You might want to inquire with the receptionist about why he/she did not notify you of his arrival, and share what you learn with your patient.  If you want him to come back to therapy, you're probably going to have to make the first move."

TalkTherapy,ff78v9g,t1_fexxg74,1579643420.0,"Definitely agree with this!  If the OP had been 12 or 13, and the perp was a friend of the family, a family member, babysitter, or neighbor, and the abuse/assault was repeated, that would prompt me to say something to the OP about reporting.  Knowing the perp's age would also be important.  On two occasions that I can recall, as a grad student, I've had to go back to a patient (after discussing with a supervisor) and inform them that I need to report.  With one patient, after learning that it had already been reported, I didn't have to, but with the other, I did have to report, despite the patient's wishes.  I, personally, still don't agree with that reporting, but I wasn't about to go against my supervisor's instructions.  Those patients were at different places, but through those experiences, I also learned that a particular agency may have rules about what must be reported.  I haven't had to do this in a while, but if a patient starts to go down the path of disclosing an assault, I'll jump in and say something like, ""Remember during our first session, I told you there were a few reasons I'd have to break confidentiality?  You're kinda heading down that path, and I just want to give you a head's up.""  More often than not, I'd end up having to report it anyway, but I wouldn't have the information CPS needed to go full force into an investigation.  I don't like the idea of allowing and/or convincing a patient to disclose all this information, and then turning around and saying it needs to be reported.  It takes control away from the patient yet again, and has the potential to blow up his/her life."
