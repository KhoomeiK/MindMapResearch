ferrets,f9253ou,t1_f8xkm9h,1575012998.0,I donâ€™t know about her ferret but my ferret is deaf and he has no trouble keeping up with the others. The worst part is finding him because he cant hear me calling and I have to bang on the floor to get his attention. He also makes noises all the time because he doesnâ€™t realize how loud heâ€™s being. Sometimes when he doesnâ€™t know weâ€™re behind him and he turns around he lights up and goes like oh! Hi! Youâ€™re here! Itâ€™s super cute. Mine doesnâ€™t have a problem with biting too hard when playing but I heard deaf ferrets van because they canâ€™t hear the others make noise.

bipolar,f22ql9q,t3_dblqtw,1569894631.0,"I wish I knew what to say that would stick however, my suggestion would to be delete the app, turn off your phone (if realistic) and either take a dose of allergy meds to help you sleep the feeling off or curl up and watch a favorite show away from some of the triggers.

bipolar,f1owd7d,t3_dada7y,1569664870.0,"Usually thereâ€™s warning signs before someone with bipolar switches from manic or depressive, itâ€™s really rare (forgive me if your bipolar is different subs) for you to snap unless youâ€™re already in a episode. You can always feel it coming, also Iâ€™ve never felt like controlling people only that I needed things to be perfect and Iâ€™d spend hours trying to get it so.
In short in my opinion she doesnt seem to have symptoms of bipolar but Iâ€™m not going to diagnose or attempt to I can only give my opinion"

BipolarReddit,ev3908z,t3_ci6kk8,1564191178.0,"I like to tell myself that  my brain didn't get fucked all at once so I can't change all at once. This doesn't give you an excuse not to try but its a reason to why I might be having a bad week with anxiety or depression. 

Also I have to remind myself that people show love differently wether it be telling you or getting you something or trying to check in with you, not everyone is going to validate you in the way you might want but look out for the ways people are trying to tell me they care."
BipolarReddit,ev37mfk,t3_ciax8u,1564190553.0,"Im 18 and I can understand this, I got diagnosed 2 years ago and those years were the roughest of my life, I lost all my friends, lost my job, failed all my classes, everything. I managed to graduate on time but I still have no friends and it's really hard to make them. Being a friendless fuck is indeed a huge bummer. 

I got a job a couple months ago but I always get the impulse to quit and thats really stressful on my mind. 

Also I believe my sister and grandma (the two who i live with) hate me and are disappointed in me. It sucks balls because I dont even know how they look at me anymore, everytime I see them I see them judging me or that theyre going to talk about me later when im out of the house about how dumb and frivolous I am. I dont like to leave my house ever and if i get into crowds i panic really bad. I feel like the whole world is just looking at me and picking me apart.

One thing thats helped me is my emotional support ferrets, I know that they arent going to judge me and they constantly give me some of the love and attention I've been lacking. I really would suggest your own animal if you do not have one. Also, bit by bit i've been trying to get out in public with my sister and taking walks around the neighborhood alone and its  been helping too. 

sorry if this is rambly, im free to dm if anyone wants to talk about our shitty lives"

Its just an impulse now so i dont even realize im doing it until my friend points it out to me, its her way of seeing im anxious."
