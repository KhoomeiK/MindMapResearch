You know that shallow, fast breaths in the chest, as If you're anticipating something? And yes I was yawning ALL THE TIME. 

When you catch yourself breathing shallowly, slowly switch to deep breathing using your diaphragm, feeling your belly going up and down and inhale and exhale for a 4-5 seconds each. It will be unnatural in the beginning, but soon it will become your default state, don't worry!"

Anxiety,fdjbnvp,t3_elokpy,1578464420.0,"It shall pass. You just need to give it time. I was in your exact situation for about a year straight and nothing could help. I was afraid to go to my bed, to be alone in the dark, i would be too aware of my breath and then start to hyperventilate. If i relaxed enough to start falling asleep, i'd start to choke, panic started to flash, or i would lose my breath as if i just stopped breathing alltogether. I had MANY sleepless nights, to the point I would pass out from exhaustion. If i managed to fall asleep it wouldn't be before 6-7 AM. I refused to self medicate, except i was drinking alcohol on the weekends because i didn't know what else to do. I thought i'll stay like that forever.
Long story short, i stopped giving a fuck. After a year of sleep deprivation and all kind of anxiety symptoms, there was nothing else there that i didn't experienced, and i kept myself in constant alarm but nothing ever happened. I stopped giving a fuck. I didn't care my heart is pounding. I don't care its palpitating. Idc i feel panicky. So what if i don't sleep, AGAIN? I will be able to function tommorow, its not my first time. So what its 6 AM right now, been there million times.
It's the opposite of what you want to do, that is the catch.  There are no quick fixes, no cures, but you will get it one day (or night lol). It will just click. You just can't explain these things, you need to live them yourself. BUT I ASSURE YOU YOU WILL SUCCEED. You will not die, you will not get sick, you will not lose your mind. You are just bewildered. I strongly recommend you to read Dr. Claire Weekes. The path she provides you with is the best one i found, and believe me, i searched the whole internet and every GAD/PD/Insomnia article and video.
Stay strong. It gets better.
