holdmyfeedingtube,fr5rfv7,t1_fr3atmy,1589913407.0,"Speaking of being a trooper let us not forget Mick Foley (playing persona ""Mankind"" in the match [""Hell in the Cell""](https://youtu.be/4aK9mNayugs)
in 1998.

*""During the bout, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. Journalist Michael Landsberg called it ""maybe the most famous match ever.""

Foley was thrown from the top of the cell through a table on the arena floor in a planned stunt, and later fell through the cage at an unplanned moment.

*""I'm the planned drop he was thrown from a height of 16–22 ft (4.9–6.7 m), if including the angle of the fall, and sent him crashing through the Spanish commentators' table, which triggered commentator Jim Ross to famously shout, ""Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him!"" and ""As God as my witness, he is broken in half!
 Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while the Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Foley's longtime friend Terry Funk was the first person on the scene, followed by WWF's resident doctor, Dr. Francois Pettit, and various others, including Vince McMahon, who broke character by looking legitimately worried about someone (Foley) that, on-air at least, he was supposed to dislike. Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out of the arena.""*


Now here's where the fun began.

*""Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cell, climbing to the top of the structure, with the Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cell surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and the Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night). With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.""*


The U breaks a hold and choke slams Mick. The chain fencing breaks and down goes Foley in an unplanned fall.

*""Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage, causing one panel to give way completely, resulting in Foley falling through and hitting the ring canvas hard below. In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, ""Good God...Good God! Will somebody stop the damn match? Enough's enough!""; along with color commentator Jerry Lawler adding, ""That's it. He's dead.""*

Wikipedia goes on:


*""The cage giving way completely was unplanned by both Foley and the Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall, yet he was able to stay in character. Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, ""Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes.""[12] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly, as he had been too exhausted to lift his body weight in response to the chokehold.[13] In his memoir Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly.""*


Foley went on to complete the match and was even chokeslammed into thumb tacks.

In the video it can be seen where his detached tooth is imbedded in his lip

The injuries Mankind sustained that night were: two missing teeth, multiple stitches below his lip, dislocated jaw, concussion, bruised kidney and a dislocated shoulder.


I'm not a fan of wrestling anymore really but I do occasionally watch every once in a while. I can say this though. Anyone that still things wrestling is fake is bind.

It may be scripted, it may be planned but the fact remains that the stunts are real. Just like stuntman and the like of Johnny Knoxville (Jackass) they do in fact get hurt. That part is very real.

Mick Foley was one of those wrestlers that bled the craft from his soul. 

Here's the match. I'm sorry it's so shitty but it was the only one I could find at the time when I was searching besides broken up ""part"" videos.

Wrong.

It was great and a few scenes had me dying including the part when Franco handles Kim at the end.


The weapon montage leading to a boner in underwear immediately preceding the sex scene had my nose exhaling rapidly.

Good movie. 

See it if you haven't.

Shhhhhhh...."
Bad_Cop_No_Donut,fr58dyx,t1_fr4dbov,1589904291.0," I'd like to add never look down a barrel when you go to clean your gun without checking the chamber first. I know it sounds kind of obvious but I lost a friend when I was a teenager this way.

  I know this probably falls under the ""don't point at anything you don't intend to shoot"". He had been hunting since a child so he knew gun safety.

  I'm guessing he got compliant. After all you aren't trying to shoot something while cleaning a gun but you should still play by the same rules. Treat it loaded.


 Now for my incident that happened before my friends death. Which leads me to also say never trust another person telling you that a gun is unloaded. Always check yourself.

  I go over to friends house who's dad was TDY in another country. Friend shows Dad's gun collection. He picked up a law 12 shotgun and told me to handle it.

 I had some experience with weapons at the time and I knew always to point the weapon down when holding it in the ready position, especially around people.

So anyways here's the layout. In his parents bedroom, standing at the end of the bed facing the headboard.

Two friends standing a few feet (maybe 3) in front of me, one slightly to the left or me, one slightly right. Like a small ""Y"" with me the bottom of the ""Y"". 

 My friend was telling me how bad ass the gun was, assured me 100% it wasn't loaded and also told me it had a hair trigger. For those unaware that means it takes just a slight amount of pressure on the trigger to fire so this example is part of the ""don't get near the trigger until ready to shoot.""

Even though I had the gun pointed at about 45 degrees downward, centered on between my friends I decided to place my finger on the trigger. You know, to get the full ""I'm holding a cool gun"" experience.

I swear on my life I just put the tiniest of pressure on the trigger. Not to try and dry fire it but to just get a solid feel.

*BOOM*

Ears instantly begun to ring and I literally felt like I was in some sort of warzone.  We are all going ""ahhh! My ears."" basically.

Hearing my friends shouts I instantly assumed the worst. ""OMG I shot someone.""  I thought to myself.

 I was still in a kinda daze so I couldn't think right and was scattered brained.  Now understand I wasn't planning on shooting the gun so I was casually holding it. When it went off it kicked from recoil and the front of the barrel shot upward when it fired about 45 degrees.

We started to come back to reality and actually everyone one safe and no one was shot.  So anyways like I said we were facing the bed. The bed also had a window right above the headboard with curtains pulled shut.  We all looked at the bed, which was a water bed BTW and we saw nothing. No holes, no damage, nothing.

  The 3rd friend (not the kid who's dad owned the gun) says: ""Did it have blanks? There's no damage.""

Before anyone could say anything I saw spots on the comforter start to appear and get wider. It was the appearance of darkening due to becoming wet.  The bed had got hit with scatter and began weeping water from the bed.

 I looked up at the curtains to take a more detailed look. 

Holes. Lots of holes. Tiny ones that were kind of hard to see. 

 I told them to look and they turned. That's when I saw black marks on both of their arms, the ones that were closest to the barrel when the gun fired. 

 As you might guess they were close enough they got some kind of powder burn or remnants of the wad but I'm only assuming.

 We were on a military base and the house had his younger siblings inside playing in the living room. It was base housing so neighbors were close and my friend knew MP's would be coming. He told his siblings who were rightfully startled that it was a firecracker and told me and my buddy to just get out of there and he would take care of the aftermath.

 We left and I never saw him again. He wasn't a close friend and was more of an acquaintance who just happened to invite us over when his parents were both gone. He had also dropped out of highschool before the incident so I never was able to see him in school again. Mind you this was like 1990 so there was no text or social media.


I shit my pants that night and gained an all new respect for weapons. In fact I didn't even touch any weapons for 10 years after that because it shook me so much.

 I don't believe this needs to be a TL;DR but I'll list one anyways.

TL;DR: don't trust no one's word a gun is not loaded and never look down a barrel of a gun while cleaning unless 1000% sure the chambers empty."

 ""It was an amored chariot that roared like a lion. 4 shields surrounded it and it rolled like a chariot without a horse.""

Looks like a replay of 1918 with the anti-mask league.

Fun fact: some strip clubs have the ladies attach a nipple cover that looks like a nipple so they can appear topless. This is in certain places where nudity and alcohol cannot be combined due to laws. So some strippers you look at can sometimes have fake nips.

My problem is that I used Jackson Hewitt for my taxes and opted for taking my preparation fees out of our refund. That caused my problem because the IRS had the DD info for a middle man bank where they took out the fees and then deposit the rest in our serve card so most of those stimulus DDs bounced back. 

 There is a theory that when they bounced back they defaulted into sending you a check because by the time you were allowed to enter the DD on the portal the failed DD had already happened.

 Not sure why all three made the same noise regardless of being engaged or not. In the end it didn't matter so I stopped being OCD about it. I understand the concern though. Sometimes they are finicky.

 I can't remember which phone I was using at the time but I know I saw reports of the OIS sticking on some people's phones and they couldn't get focus to lock. They tapped their phone in their palm sharply and freed up the OIS and then they were able to focus again. Might have been the Note 9 but not sure.  Not that this has anything to do with OPs issue but just adding my experiences with OIS.

legaladvice,fo6fidl,t3_g5tnd0,1587557338.0,"Just a similar experience I had. Neighbor signed for mine. Not sure if the driver went to the wrong door or the neighbor was standing outside or something.
Idiot used his real last name signing. So when I saw my package was delivered with his name I knocked on the door. He claimed to know nothing about my package.
 
 He got pissy so I went back inside and called the police for advice. Once I told them I had a screenshot of the neighbors signature they decided to send an officer over.

I got my package. Neighbor got away with basically stealing a package because he told the officer he was merely being a good neighbor and accepted the package for me. A case of he said she said etc.

Bullshit.

Neighbor was a shady dope dealer of the powder kind.

I hope everything works out OP.  Fortunately in my years I've only had a few hiccups with shipping so my experience hasn't been too bad. I mean hundreds of packages. I think 2 times I had a major hiccup.

Other than occasional delays for obvious reasons I've always had good experiences even with expensive items.

Oh I forgot my third hiccup and fortunately that didn't end badly.

A USPS worker left my package on top of the outdoor mailboxes. I guess that sat it on top while they put other mail into other people boxes and forgot to place my package in the larger delivery box. You know the kind when your package is too big so they put it in a larger box and just leave a key in your mail box.

Anyways long story short it was a 1200$ camera lens and I was watching the tracker like a hawk. When it said it was delivered I ran down to find my package just sitting there all itself in top the box.

I got lucky.  I was upset but wasn't furious or anything so I called the post office and politely explained. They didn't believe me at all. 


TL;DR: sometimes shipping sucks but mostly it doesn't. Sorry for the long winded post I'm just extremely bored during lockdown and just needing to participate somehow."
homeless,fo6czn6,t3_g5s1mh,1587555099.0,"Hey OP anyway you can cook the steak and keep the veggies in some foil or something close to the heat? Might not get searing on them but still would be two birds one stone.

Speaking of bird I remember one technique I used when I was homeless occasionally if the circumstance fit.
 I'd have a campfire for warmth/coffee and maybe some quick breakfast in the morning. After a while I would remove a large rock from the fire ring and let it cool for like 5 minutes just a little. I'd wrap the rock in a couple bath towels. I'd take a well wrapped Cornish hen in foil and place the chicken and the hot rock in a back pack and shove some other fabric in as added insulation.

 Depending on how got the rock is it would cook my chicken in 2-4 hours. Almost like a slow roast.

Just a modified version of burying a pig in coals I suppose but it was quick and easy.

Also another live saver was cowboy coffee. For those that are unaware it's coffee made without a coffee maker or instant coffee. Adding cold water after brewed gets the coffee grounds to sink the to bottom and then you can pour into a cup and mostly be coffee ground free .

Use a sauce pan or whatever and just bring your grounds and water to a low simmer for a couple minutes, remove from heat and let sit a minute, pour in a coffee cup worth or cold water slowly, 30 seconds and then pour slowly out into cup.

Seriously this makes a great cup of coffee. My technique might be shit but it works for me. Some folks swear by cowboy coffee.

 Honestly it was the one thing that really made my wife feel normal and comforting while we were homeless.

 Morale is important and it's even better when it's good food. Glad you eating good OP.

Sometimes it's truly the little things.

Stay healthy, stay safe."

stimuluscheck,fnw03ir,t3_g47t01,1587308665.0,"JH filer here. Used Serve card without refund advance for last three tax years. Filed taxes around the 17th of March. Refund deposited on Serve card March 23. Quickest refund I've ever had. 

 Anyways I was lurking a FB group that started a few days after announcements were made about stimulus deposits beginning to drop. This was before the payment portal ever went live.

Numerous accounts of JH customers calling customer support and being told everything was alright. Nothing to worry about and you would get your check.

 Well a few, and I mean very few, started reporting receiving pending deposits to be released days later. 
Rumors went around saying if you got a refund advance your refund went to an intermediate bank to remove refund advance fees etc. So in that case they were saying IRS didn't have your DD info.
 
 Then it was said that if didn't get a refund advance that you were good to go. 

No.

Seems if you used your taxes to pay your preparation fees the same thing happened. Goes to other bank first for free removal.

The day the payments were suppose to clear in bank accounts was when most folks realized they been lied to and people were told though the FB group to go see if the IRS needed their DD info at the payment portal.

 Tons of folks needed to update their DD including myself. I got in very early the first morning the payment portal was opened up and I updated my DD info successfully without any problems. I began checking once or twice a day to see if it the status was updated. For two or three days it just kept telling me that they would deposit my stimulus into that bank account and that they would give me an update with the date it would happen.

Then like with countless others people it told me that my stimulus would be mailed out on the 24th.

I did everything correctly like a lot of others. I entered my DD info on day one and it still happened to me.

Now rumors are saying it's a glitch in the system and it will be fixed Monday. But yeah... It's a rumour so who really knows. 

Some have also received a status update saying it will be in their account Wednesday. Most people are getting the BS ""checks being mailed"" though 


Nothing from JH about this but I did get an [email](https://i.imgur.com/GZQE2EW.jpg)
I think a day or two ago from Serve.

I had taken care of that issue days before the email though.

We'll see Monday if it's really a GliTcH or not. I hope it is because I don't think I'll have enough food to wait for a paper check.

It sucks and people are pissed but it is what it is unfortunately.

Hopefully you won't have a problem but don't depend on it.

Coronavirus,fnq9r2v,t1_fnpplqm,1587160418.0,"Montana here. My town looked like things were back to normal after Trump's announcement last night.

Half the local comments I see online are from people who don't even know the details of opening up. It's just like ""wooo... Git'r done. Open this bitch up!""

I'm at a complete loss and I'm starting to question my own reality."
Futurology,fnq7pgc,t1_fnpg57z,1587159277.0,"I live in rural Montana. People here have been almost split 50/50 on the whole thing. Meaning that half agree doing the right proactive things and the others think it's no big deal because we're Montana. One gas station has sanitizer stations out front and employees have masks and gloves. The other has nothing. It's like this a lot of places and the ones that are doing nothing are just literally shitting on those that do.

Ok so people have been low key mostly in public still. 

That is until today....

After Trump's announcement last night about opening the country back up it looks like things are back to normal out in public. Like this whole thing never even happened. I witnessed a women walk into a small gas station with all four of her children.  People coughing without covering their faces. People talking about protesting their rights to freedom and have their businesses open.  The people I've seen online locally don't even seem to understand the phases in opening. It's just like ""git'r done, let's open this bitch!""
I had a strange vision while witnessing the activity down town while I drove through. It was literally like I was looking at the walking dead. I'm sitting there like ""is this real?"" ""Is this a dream or something?""

No it's not. And this scares me. It's like the country is dividing into two factions. Those that want freedom and money, and those who value life.

Sad thing is that those looking to rush opening the country without proper mitigation are just going to make things worse for themselves. There will be more restrictions for a longer amount of time.
 
Not to be gloomy but next thing you know will have some kind of violence. A stand off, vandalizing of business's refusing to remain closed.  Perhaps a bit of vigilantism even. I'm seriously not trying to fear monger at all. This is a completely plausible possibility in my opinion and that scares the fuck out of me. I mean what would be next? Martial Law? Civil war?

My anxiety level just keeps rising weekly throughout this. I wish is was just all some dream but sadly I cannot wake up from this one. Reality hits you hard bro.
