I’m kind of an old school weeknd fan and I was looking to buy triology in a music store when the guy behind the counter said they had just gotten in his newest album, Kiss Land. I knew nothing about this album, but I knew I liked the weeknd so I bought it and put it on my 2006 cd player (lol this was 2013 and I still used that player) the minute I got home. And it was a masterpiece for me at first listen. It was honestly an experience. Everything was just so well put together and consistent and unique and personal and visionary.

Little backstory; I grew up in an abusive household, was sexually abused as a child, was diagnosed with ocd, bipolar and an eating disorder as a teenager and in my early twenties. Spent months in clinics, had manic episodes which lead to drugs and more sexual abuse and basically destroyed my life over and over and ruined every opportunity I got, despite being born in a developed/rich country and having top grades in school. I’m 24 now and I’ve been dedicating the last two years to rehabilitation, healing and just accepting things that has happened to me and focused on moving on. I never thought I could do that, 15 year old me would’ve never believed it. But currently things are good and they have been for a while. I’ve craved stability all my life and surprisingly I found it through challenging myself and trying a bunch of different things until there literally was nothing more to be scared of.

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fol7e44,t1_fodvcmi,1587856343.0,"Hello! I’m so glad you found this helpful. There are so many great responses here.

I think one of the major reasons that we’re so courageous as children is because the world and society hasn’t «gotten to us yet». Like I mentioned, the more I personally realize about the world, the more scared I become, and therefore I tend to pull back in fear because I don’t want to be in a position where the world/society can get to me. «Ignorance is bliss» you know, and the more you ignore  whatever happens around you, the happier you’ll technically become..but
that same happiness can be hollow and empty, if you’re at heart somebody who really cares. We need to choose what’s most important to us, instant happiness or happiness with ourselves/who we are. 

I’m sorry to hear about your situation at work. It’s cruel and you deserve better. Building the confidence and strenght to acknowledge that you have the power to speak up is however (as you and I both know) very complex. But if your coworkers are targeting you based on you being a minority, I hope you live in a place where you have the upper hand and can find the courage to report discrimination or any other behaviour that makes you feel uncomfortable. Have you ever tried to mention it to your boss? Or do you have meetings/surveys or anything that could be used to report it?

I’m sure you already are, even if you don’t always speak up. I’ll share something personal with you and that is how my mother is heavily affected by social anxiety, she’s been this way all her life. But even though she’s very much afraid of confrontation, she has so many other great qualities that I admire. We are all different, and like someone else mentioned, it’s also okay to be quiet and choose our battles. 

I am like you sometimes too, I feel like a child because I don’t speak up. There’s another quote that goes «feel the fear and do it anyway» and I think that’s very relevant for all of us, because when you think about it everyone is afraid. 

I think working on ourselves and becoming more confident in order to speak up when we feel the need to can be very helpful for our personal growth.

Gilmore girls is essentially a very relationship based show, it’s all about the people and the community and who you are/who you want to be. I’m sure it can be a very healing show to watch while analyzing your own life and personal relationships. 

It’s interesting because I grew up watching this show (my older sister watched it) and I find that whatever state/age/situation I’m in while watching, I relate to different characters or side with different characters. For example my tendency to favour Rory with Jess was a pure reflection of myself, as I identified with him a lot as a teenager and wanted him to be understood, because I myself wanted to be understood. It is, like you said, very well written and you do get very emotionally invested. 


I’m so glad you found some comfort in this show and I truly think you’ll be okay. In GG everything does not necessarily work out the way the characters want them to, but everything is still okay. Sometimes things aren’t that great, but they’re still yours and that’s valuable. I hope your relationship with your ex has thaught you a lot, keep growing :)🌻🌻🌻"

relationship_advice,fng28n3,t3_g15i07,1586920618.0,"Bipolar here. My father is also bipolar and we have a long history with this disorder. Your mom leaving the kids with you is extreme mania, it’s almost on the verge of psychosis. If you seek help from professionals they will have to give her some kind of treatment because of the severity of the case. And because she put other people in danger by leaving her kids. That’s the criteria for treatment, putting yourself or others at risk. 

I’m not sure where you are from, but where I live this sounds like a case for the police, cause it’s actually an emergency. If you get in contact with them they can find your mom and further the case to social services. A police report may also help with your mom’s potential treatment. She obviously needs treatment, but most people with this disorder will refuse. However (depending on where you live) if you «cross over» to full mania/psychosis you will most likely be sent to psyciatric hospital and then eventually a clinic. In the hospital she will most likely be medicated against her will, but if she’s sent to a clinic she will have the option to be medicated or not. Speaking from experience here, but it might be different where you live. They might offer a deal where of she goes through some sort of treatment plan and if she follows it she’ll get to stay with her kids and if she doesn’t social services will get involved with the kids. 

I’m really worried about you and your family. I hope everything will be okay. If you get too overwhelmed I hope you find the strenght in your heart to keep pushing through this. You’ve done an amazing job so far."

Many «witches» you hear about that were banished or burned alive or executed in other horrible ways were actually mosty just women of a certain power. That power could be of a sexual nature (men would blame women for causing their «sin» aka lust) or power that seemed foreign to the general population and went against religious beliefs (like natural medicine aka women who knew science were «witchdoctors»). Women are in many ways a man’s biggest weakness, so it was very easy for a powerful man in a patriarchal society to blame them."

GilmoreGirls,fmcnn9q,t1_fmbazgk,1585949171.0,"Hi, this is long, sorry about that, but I’ll try to give my best answer. 

The key difference for me would be that Jess’s character in itself was kind, while I didn’t get that impression of Logan’s character. Rory cared about humanity and wanted to be like Christiane Amanpour, showing that her root cause was to always be one with the people. In my opinion, her relationship with Logan destroyed that aspect of her because he was never about humanity and global causes, he barely cared about anything at all. The good thing about him was that he was honest and gave Rory some challenges when it came to who she was and wanted to be. He had integrity and confidence, but he lacked the passion, vision and depth that Jess had. Of course I don’t hold Logan responsible for Rory’s bad choices, but I never thought he was a good influence on her either. If Rory ever were to reach her full potential, she needed to be with somebody who matched her ideal (or just be single, as most ambitious people probably should be). However the show pretty much established by the end that her character always was a bit shallow and that her ideals as a teenager might not have matched her ideals as an adult, which is fine cause that happens in life. 

Anyway, Jess and Rory actually remind me a bit of Gatsby and Daisy from The Great Gatsby. Because Gatsby is this hopeless romantic with a tragic past, but he loves his passion and he loves this girl and he thinks he can have her because it seems so perfect, but then in the end they live in different worlds and because of that it can’t ever work out the way they want it to. A bit of a dramatic comparison I know, but just an example for emphasis.
But all this is of course just my opinion. I think what defines a relationship as good or bad is very personal and a reflection of oneself, so everyone is going to have different perspectives on this. 

As an example one could say that people who thought Dean was perfect for Rory valued loyality and safety. They wanted Rory to be stable, live close to home and have a family life with family values. While the people who thought Logan was the perfect boyfriend valued confidence, honesty and being spontaneous. They wanted her to live life to the fullest and have many opportunities. While people like me, who mostly valued Jess’s intelligence and passion wanted her to be ambitious and challenged. My point is; there’s no right or wrong. It’s all just a reflection of who you are and what you value. That’s why I appreciated the show’s take on this whole love triangle thing and the fact that it had an open ending so the audience could question her future."
GilmoreGirls,fmas9g2,t3_fty998,1585905792.0,"This was an act of desperation though, it doesn’t define Jess’s character as a whole as he obviously always cared more about her freedom than her being with him in the end. Jess was in no way «toxic» compared to Dean or Logan in my opinion. The biggest problem with Jess was that he didn’t trust anyone and was too proud to be vulnerable, aka he wasn’t ready or emotionally mature enough to be in a relationship. 

I think this scene is a great visual representation of how he sees Rory as the only one who ever understood him, that’s why he wants to be with her so badly. Young love is usually selfish like that because both have to work on themselves and might want different things in life. Jess also had major problems with people abandoning him (his parents and probably every girl before Rory) and feeling unwanted, so that might have contributed to the desperation in this particular scene. It’s a combination of fear from being abandoned again and losing the one person that you feel like understoods you.

In the end I think Jess really wanted Rory to be the ideal version of herself (the intelligent, adventurous, world travelling writer) but she herself really just wanted to be like her (role model) mother, living in a small town and raising a child of her own."

halsey,fm0a9fg,t3_frhqpx,1585650854.0,"I’ve never actually cared much about her before Manic came out. I liked «Is There somewhere» and a couple of songs from Badlands, but when she released Manic I was hooked and started to really respect her work because of her dedication to represent bipolar disorder (which I also have and have suffered from quite heavily) in a genuine and positive way.

I had heard Nightmare and thought it was awesome, but I really felt it when she changed the sound and tone of her album because it didn’t fit her idea of mania. That made me respect her even more because she didn’t represent mania in the way that popular culture usually does, instead she showed the vulnerable side of it and described very clearly that that was what she was doing. I was actually so impressed by that, even though I’m just a casual fan. So Manic definetly didn’t ruin anything for me, it’s my favourite album from her by far. I’m more exited to hear from her now than ever before. 

I’ve paid more attention to her lately and I’m just surprised that she manages to deal with anything at all considering her disorder. If I get even slightly overwhelmed I end up in the hospital so yeah..🤷🏻‍♀️ I think she should take more breaks in general because it seems like she needs it. There’s also a global pandemic going on and things aren’t exactly easy for anyone right now. If she wants a break from the whole circus of touring, social media, media in general etc. than she should totally do that. 

I can understand the frustration that comes with the merch issues of course, you have every right to be pissed since you should receive what you paid for. Maybe they have issues we don’t know about yet or something went wrong, it’s however really really unfortunate. I’m sure you’ll get what you ordered, but you probably have to wait for a long time if you haven’t already. Least they could do is to make a statement about the merch and also update the fans on what’s going on with the corona virus and cancellations. Other artist have already done that a long time ago.

Anyway, what I’ve noticed about her team is that they have a tendency to overcompensate, like not only with merch but with everything. And sometimes that’s a good strategy that works (like when she had one album out and mostly a cult following but sold out MSG) and sometimes it‘s not. I guess overcompensating overall is a good thing, but they shouldn’t be hasty and also consider that Halsey is not Taylor Swift, if you understand what I mean by that."

You need to be confident to create the art and vision you want, can’t let insecurity stand in your way. Try pretending that the people in your house are a live audience, or better yet ask them to watch when you record, that will make things less weird and you’ll get good practise. I do understand insecurity though and If you absolutely can’t do it in your own home, you can always rent a studio or book a practise room if you have that where you live/close by. Practise rooms are cheaper than a studio and soundproof, so no one else will hear you (that loud anyways, but you won’t know themso it doesn’t matter)."

AskFeminists,fi8auif,t3_f6x55c,1582236689.0,"I’m norwegian and I’d like to say Norway, but I also want to mention some things about Norway that aren’t that great for women. Compared to the rest of the world it’s good, but it’s not perfect even though many think it is. We actually even have a word for it: the equality complex (likestillingskomplekset). It basically states how women in our country aren’t equal to men, but people don’t pay attention to it because they think it is (because norway is known for being one of the best countries in the world). 

However, women don’t really hold top positions here, they don’t have equal pay (people can say whatever they want, but I’ve literally studied this in university and it’s a fact. For example women who work as therapist in a public sector earn 80 000 kr less a year than men, that equals around 8600 dollars). 

I was also really surprised by my professor in social science class, because he stated that India has a much better system when it comes to the balance between men/women in different types of positions. In Norway it’s very «gender based», like women work as nurses, men work as doctors. I found this especially interesting because I’m actually Indian too (half norwegian/half indian) and I’ve noticed this «balance» myself as I’ve spent a lot of time there. 
In Norway people can be very judgemental about countries like India because they only know it from what they see in the media, so they don’t really know how things actually are there. Most think you get raped by walking on the street after five minutes, so it was so refreshing to finally be able to hear someone from Norway acknowledge that women’s rights actually are quite prominent in India too. Indian women are really really strong and intelligent, but they are strangled by their environment.

Other than topics related to work, in Norway we have a problem with rape and sexual abuse. It’s not taken seriously enough and the offenders usually get to go free without jail time or anything. They also get their identity protected so they could do it to again with no problem. We actually had a huge thing that happened a couple of years ago with a young girl who was raped by a group of older men and literally nobody cared. So she exposed their identity herself because it was the only way to get some sort of justice and protect others. The thing is though that she got in trouble with the law for exposing them...Amnesty also had a report in 2019 on how rape and sexual abuse in norway is almost «punishment free».

So yeah, I’d like to say Norway and I’m sure we have it ten thousand times better than other countries, but it’s not perfect. I sadly don’t think any country is perfect for women. 

This was hella long btw, I’m just really interested😅"

unpopularopinion,fi6ipmg,t3_f6nti5,1582196757.0,"I’m a sociology student and can confirm that «illegal immigrants» shouldn’t really be offensive because it’s one of the official cartegories of immigration, just like social/economic immigration is. My father for example is a social/economic immigrant that got to stay in our country (he’s asian, we live in scandinavia) because he’s an engineer and this was during the 70’s where more workers were needed. If a person gets smuggled across a border, they are illegal immigrants because it’s illegal. It’s not an offensive thing to say because it’s true. I can understand that it’s a sensitive topic because of the terrible conditions these immigrants go through, but theoretically speaking it’s a form of illegal immigration and therefore should go under that name. 

I think people aren’t familiar with the different types of immigration and that’s why they call it offensive. They see it as a personal attack because of the topics sensitivity, when it’s actually just categorization. There are five different types of immigration or something, one of many terms. But then again, some people with racist motives will use the term and go out of their way to offend somebody, and that’s when it becomes dangerous for society to use the term as you no longer try to categorize people for informational/factual reasons, but try to separate people from eachother on a social level."

Sex is the one thing everyone is interested in (unless asexual), so it's kinda like the color red - your eyes automatically gets drawn to it and corporations and the media knows this and take advantage of that. I can't help you much in the real world, but online at least I recently downloaded a ""filter"" for my browser where I can basically make any unwanted content disappear.

AskReddit,fh9u17q,t1_fgsvrqi,1581389595.0,"Interesting question! Sexual attraction and being in love with someone are two different things though. 

I’ve thought about this before because I’m a lesbian and I’m sexually attracted (on a physical level) to masculine girls, but when it comes to who I’m in love with, masculinity doesn’t matter at all, as I’ve been in love with the same girl for over ten years now and she’s not maaculine at all. She’s one of the most feminine people I know, and that’s saying a lot since I’m friends with people who do beauty pageants haha.

Anyway, a lot of people find themselves attracted to people with a touch of sexual ambiguity because it triggers feelings/sensations within their own human sexuality. Being with a masculine woman can for example give the sensation of mystery and the feeling of curiousity, as ambigious people in general are very attractive because they defy our expectations. Examples are David Bowie and Ruby Rose, whom most people would agree that are very attractive because of ambiguity. In a lesbian relationship (assuming that one is more masculine than the other) the masculine/feminine aspect might actually be completely random because of this. What I’m saying is basically that everyone, no matter what sexuality, will be attracted to ambiguity in some way or another because of our psychology, but for straigt people this won’t be acted on because of lack of sexual desire (straight women won’t be turned on by another woman) and the dynamic of gender roles in a heterosexual relationship. These things don’t matter to lesbians, which might be why the masculine/feminin aspect becomes more visible there. Keep in mind that this is just a theory though, don’t mean to come across as I know shit cause I really don’t. I’m a psychology student btw, so it’s not my theory :-)"

Advice,fgey0o9,t1_fget3ls,1580714595.0,"* (edit: setting this up here instead of at the end) Sorry for the super long reply, you don’t have to read everything or respond if you don’t want to. I’m still lying awake, but at least now I don’t think as much about what happened earlier so thank you, maybe I’ll get some sleep eventually :-) 


Wow, that’s what I call a response, thanks for taking the time to write this. I also appreciate the inclusion of both negative/positive replies, most people don’t do that, it’s interesting to read and makes one think a bit. 

First of I should probably mention that I have my fair share of mental health issues. I just don’t really correlate them to this, but you’re right about the fact that it’s probably a part of it. I’m bipolar (it’s better now than before, as I used to be in therapy and a clinic two years ago). This is direct, but I was also sexually abused as a child by someone close to me, which I didn’t admit to myself until I was 21 back when I was in therapy. There’s been some other issues with bullying and insomnia, so that probably affects my mindset and sleep habits too. So maybe I’m biased, but if that’s the case I feel like it’s just because I don’t want others to feel the way I have. 

About #3, I’d say that I consider the situation before I decide to take action. I know there might be two sides to a story, but I wonder if this is the way one always should think even when a potential problem appears right in front of you. The man and woman on the train for example, there might be more to that story, but what happened happened right in front of me, I both saw and heard it, so I feel like I should be alarmed by that. I didn’t step in though, because I was, you know, trying to mind my own and not get into trouble, but I sometimes think that what if everyone always tries to mind their own business, and then nobody would end up getting help? It’s a bit of a «choose your battles» scenario though, I know that. And it’s not like I’ll save anyone by doing it (most likely), but I think it’s better to care a lot than to not care at all. Maybe not stress so goddamn much about it as I do and get into trouble because of it, but at least not completely ignore it. 

About #6, I’m etnically ambigious and grew up in what is regarded as one of the best countries in the world (Norway) and one of the world’s big, development countries, India. So I’ve had my fair share of clashing opinions of what’s right and what’s wrong, considering that these two countries are very different. I’m also a former anthropology student, so this was often something that came up. I understand that what works for some people might not work for all, but with that being said, I won’t change my opinion if I truly believe something is for the better. But not in order to be right, but in order to raise understanding of what would benefit most people and the world in general. However I don’t speak up about things I don’t know much about. For example, I don’t know very much about gun violence other than what I read in the media and what I’ve learned in class, so I don’t have first hand experience like you do. I would say I’m against guns, but I can understand why people feel the need to have them in certain areas. That doesn’t mean that I support the use of them, but I’d say the issue is a little more complex than «who should have guns and who shouldn’t». To me it would seem like an issue that would need to get cut off from the roots, which in your example could be poverty and crime. I’m also used to living in Norway, a country with very few cases of gun violence and where it’s also impossible to buy a gun, so then again I acknowledge the fact that Norway is not a poor country in any way and generally has a very low crime rate. So it can’t be compared. As a child in India I grew up very differently than I did in Norway though, I’m pretty sure that the contrast might have affected me a lot. You see things that you can’t really unsee in a country like India, and you compare that to a place where that would never happen and it makes you very angry and sad that such a contrast even exist. You immedeatly want to change things because you know that change is a possibility because you’ve seen it in another country. It might be a long way to go, but it gives hope of change not being impossible. I don’t consider myself self-righteous because I truly feel like I respect others point of view, but as you said there are blurred lines between what’s right and what’s wrong and that might be the biggest issue here. I think that’s hard for everyone though, accepting that you can’t change everything and ending up depressed because of it. 

I also like what you said about staying focused, because I feel like this thing I have has me running in all directions. It also takes a lot of my time/makes me tired. Actually really helpful response as I’ve been told a million times that I need to focus more on ONE thing and not the whole world, but never in this context. I’ve never actually thought about that might being the reason for the insane overworking. I find that when I focus on one thing (like when I got my new job and had to learn everything in 2 days, it’s a therapy center for people with disabilities) I actually forgot about everything else while still doing something good for people who need it. 
So that’s a really good point and I thank you for bringing that to my attention."
