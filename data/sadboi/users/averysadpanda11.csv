MomForAMinute,fgjpiqv,t3_eysddn,1580848838.0,"My aunt gave up a child at 15. Her mother was dying from cancer and she just couldn’t care for the baby as well as the child deserved. She gave him up and even though she has kids today, she thinks of him every day. She loves him, and wishes she knew him, but never doubted the choice she made. She mourns him and celebrates his birthday every year. He’d be mid-twenties now, and I hope he knows how incredibly loved he is. I believe you’re loved too, so much. Though I hope you’ve never doubted that, you’ve been given the chance to be loved by two families who wish for your success. :)"
caloriecount,fgfkd72,t1_fgfk0l5,1580741100.0,"That’s okay! But still, you should really aim for at the LEAST 1200. 
Have you ever researched TDEE? If not I’m happy to give you a run down :) just remember-being overweight doesn’t mean you can’t have an eating disorder. I know. I’ve been there. Counting calories is the only real sustainable way to lose weight, but it can also become a dangerous obsessive habit that starves you if you’re not super careful. Feel free to message me about TDEE or whatever, I’ve got a lot of science backed info-but also, don’t be afraid to talk to a doctor about nutrition plans. Mine gave me something as simple as “eat two apples and drink 8oz of water before lunch and dinner.” Because you just won’t eat as much. And I have BED so that’s an issue for me. 

Just be safe out there ♥️"
caloriecount,fgf9dqe,t1_fgev3j0,1580731053.0,"Just make sure to talk to a medical professional about the amounts you’re consuming. I don’t like to assume peoples relationship with docs, but generally 1200/day is what is considered a minimum to fuel your body. If you’ve been advised otherwise for some reason, that’s okay, but if not please just be careful. An apple is like ~80, green tea is less. You can cause your body to crash horribly eating this way and run the risk of getting into eating disorder territory. We just want you to be safe and healthy :)"

I’ve seen some people put litter pads and such down-but also the human “pee pads” for elderly are MUCH CHEAPER than the ones you buy at the pet store, if you ever need use."

jobsearching,fej8kir,t3_ec0pvb,1579161541.0,"I think it depends on experience/area. Around here (Dallas area) it’s very difficult to get a job making over $40k/yr without a degree or years of experience in very very specific fields. 
I’ve worked in a laboratory environment for 5+ years and am having trouble finding anything over $37k. 

Im in school now and have even more trouble because people don’t want to hire students. It’s very frustrating"

Which is dumb I know, but if i have the energy to cook i have to cook for 4 people and I don’t generally have leftovers and normally the two at home all day don’t want to wait until 930 when i get home during the week to eat dinner. I’m just also lazy i guess"

I took phentermine from my doc for a while for weight (wasn’t crazy about the idea of a diet pill but he was interested in trying). It really didn’t help me lose weight but HOLY COW I was so functional on it he immediately put me on vyvanse long term to treat ADD I discovered. 


I am really bad about taking my meds on the weekends. I will make a better effort to take them and hopefully it’ll help a lot!!"
