USMCboot,f1nndnv,t1_f1nmt7p,1569621245.0,Would an example of that be a Marine going some where on RA prior to MCT? I know Marines have been sent on RA during the Holidays if they were awaiting class up?
USMCboot,f1nm7yt,t1_f1nlo3e,1569620418.0,"Ok, so do Marines rate perdiem on top of this / or is this referencing how perdiem is actually calculated?"

USMCboot,f1naahx,t1_f1n8i7l,1569612578.0,Agreed. Maybe uniform allowance with the pay from meals and per diem for the day of travel in between duty stations.  Nuff said check the LES ON MyPay
USMCboot,f1n6fxn,t1_f1n4grt,1569610059.0,"Maybe if this Marine got married recently or has a dependent then yes. He would of had to jump through paperwork hoops and would be very aware of this extra pay.  Otherwise, you do not just randomly get BAH. You also don't randomly get BAS.  That requires paperwork and routing through your chain of command. So NO. Stop spreading false information."

USMCboot,f1mil44,t1_f1mft1p,1569594755.0,"Correct, no per diem when on leave.... nobody is talking or referencing getting per diem on leave. But as you said reimbursement for the cost of travel for the mileage plus meals, which is part of per diem.  If this Marine traveled home and went on leave and then to SOI on his own dime, then he gets mileage cost plus per diem rate for the days of travel."

USMCboot,f1loikg,t3_d9to0h,1569561547.0,I'm pretty sure you got paid per diem between boot camp and ITB.  Pending on where you traveled from and how many days travel you were authorized on your orders.  Look at your LES on My pay.

He saved my life and gave me a second chance and extended and showed His amazing grave directly onto my soul. .That's the only way I can explain.  He gave me the water so I'd never thirst, and the bread of life that I would never tire or feel exhausted. Some days are ups and downs. It didn't happen over night. It was baby steps. Those initial days after August 3, 2008. I just focused on breathing and eating. I'm going to be 36 in two days. I'm just now dealing with the sexual abuse trauma from when I was 5-10.

How much do you know of all their is to know in the universe??? Stop assuming then and start searching for answers.

Coping mechanisms? Primarily has to do with starting positive to tell yourself positive things and not believe in the lies. There are alot of lies.  Most coping mechanisms that would have a positive impact I would say, is get time doing self care. Things that you like or love to do that are healthy.
