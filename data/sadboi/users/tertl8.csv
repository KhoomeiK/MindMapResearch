I was thinking of using keys for a mech keyboard and just getting them etched or whatever, but I think chunter16 has  a point, what would we print on them?  it would be so small to no be able to read.  Renoise really has a shit ton of shortcuts..maybe some color coding could be useful but idk, everyone uses renoise a little differently. check out the ableton one...
