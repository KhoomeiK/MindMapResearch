science,fr0cxig,t1_fqzsi82,1589791192.0,"Coming at psychs from the point of view that their effects are somehow mediated externally is missing the point entirely.

You don’t need to bring anything in from the outside, the change of how the brain is working is enough.

And the dream thing would maybe have some credence if anyone actually brought something back from these ‘different’ dimensions you could measure, but again dreaming is a change in how the brain is functioning due to effects on consciousness.
