OpiatesRecovery,fr62pj4,t3_gmpwqb,1589918875.0,"I personally think it has something to do with certain memories being more vibrant when tied to the excessive serotonin boost that drugs cause when they get you high. Most of my 'good' memories were when I was high as hell...simply because I was high as hell... but I know realistically that I was a complete wreck during all of them. Your mind makes you forget because all it cares about is the fact that it made you feel happy, and warm, and good. I felt good, but I wasn't in control. Our bodies are going to miss those feelings of being high, and make us yearn for those feelings, especially if you're still dealing with depression and low levels of serotonin from PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome for those that aren't as well versed in what comes after coming off of opiates). This will continue to even out as your body keeps returning to normal, and it WILL get better as more months go by.

Basically, what you're going through is completely normal and what you're feeling is a result of your body attempting to get you back on whatever it was that was making you feel so 'happy'. Memories can be purposefully vague for this reason.  But we both know better than this, the 'excitement' may last a few hours and then you'll need more and more and more. I'm proud of you OP for realizing what you have now is better than the drugs. 

Stay strong and don't give in. If you have yearnings, talk to friends or family if possible. You've got this."
OpiatesRecovery,fq8lxjy,t3_ghe8nx,1589169323.0,"I've been addicted to pain pills since I was 15 years old after having brain surgery. I'm 28 now, and the last few years I've been trying to get clean have been hell... and I'll tell you right now that I've relapsed many, many times. However, I didn't give up because giving up is what your mind wants you to do to give in and take more drugs so you can feel better. Relapse is honestly normal for many people, but the main difference is deciding to learn from what happened or not.

Each time I relapsed, I tried to understand why it happened for THAT specific situation. Writing it out and finding possible solutions is a must IMO. What lead up to it? If it's because you were in pain, talk to your doctor to come up with a plan. If you were anxious, figure out something that could help you stay distracted. If you were depressed, come up with a plan for emotional support from friends or family. Whatever it is, write it down and don't give up. Come up with a plan for the next time it happens, and try your new method of coping. Getting through withdrawal is going to rely heavily on learning new coping skills for the pain, the stress and anxiety and depression we've been covering up with opiates.

&#x200B;

The best thing you can do for yourself is to keep working forward and be kind to yourself. Remember to think about what went wrong this time, and do what you can to eliminate it the next time. But above all else, do NOT give up.

&#x200B;

Edit: I would also strongly recommend detox or rehab if you have the options available. My biggest break through was after I was successfully and mostly painlessly withdrawn at a detox center. Since then, I've had only one minor relapse and nothing else. 

PS: Deleting your dealer's number is absolutely amazing, but you're going to want to go above and beyond and block it as well because if he still has your number, he can still contact you and you'll know who it is given the context. Take steps now to keep yourself from relapsing in the future. Good luck, OP, you've got this."

CPTSD,fmdwdfp,t3_funt41,1585980137.0,"I used to be angry toward people like this, but instead I learned to empathize with them. I've been through countless traumas myself, going through brain surgery, working crime and trauma scene clean up, losing my grandfather to suicide, losing my father to suicide and finding his body, and so much more. These situations helped me understand things better and empathize with others more, but at the same time it made me realize that if I hadn't gone through these experiences, I would have shrugged them off like I've been guilty of doing in the past. Why? Because people are self-interested and typically only reach outside themselves when they actually experience something. What is traumatic for one person may be a walk in the park for another, but to that person it's one of the hardest things they've faced at that time. This doesn't make their trauma any less, you only know what they've decided to tell you and not the full story. You don't have a right to judge them.

Talking about 'pretend trauma' makes you sound like a huge asshole and you should feel bad about it. Stop talking to him if it bothers you so much, instead of 'laughing at him behind his back.' That is what makes you a bad person. Act like an adult and talk it out with him. He can't read your mind if you don't tell him what bothers you.

I personally wouldn't wish my trauma onto anyone else, and I'm GLAD they don't know what it's like. It's not a competition."

AskWomen,fkgleov,t3_fhzzxk,1584163641.0,"I grew up in an extremely dysfunctional home, both my parents had genetic brain diseases, one of which my mother passed onto me. So I had brain surgery when I was 15 and when you're focused on not being in pain every day, it kind of kills your libido. I genuinely thought I was asexual for most of my life. 

I was also dealing with my grandfather killing himself, and years later I was forced to watch my father attempt twice, with the second attempt being successful. I'm always worried the people I love are going to leave me or die so I'm hyper-focused on the relationships I have left with my family... which working crime and trauma scene clean up hasn't helped much. 

I worked crime and trauma clean up way before my father killed himself, but it didn't prepare me for it. I'm aware I need intensive therapy, but another part of me literally doesn't care for another person at this point...I'm genuinely not lonely and get irritated when people won't leave me alone when I get exhausted or am in pain.

I've also noticed when I get bad dizziness during episodes not caused by a seizure, it usually happens when I've got bad computer vision syndrome from staring at screens too long (I can usually tell the difference because with a seizure I tend to get a migraine shortly after).

I started keeping a diary that helped me learn to differentiate different triggers for my dissociation and I'd honestly recommend it. Sometimes even things that seem inconsequential can have a huge impact, such a not enough sleep, too much sleep, migraines, headaches, not eating enough and having low blood sugar, anxiety, etc.

It's also extremely possible your dissociation is causing you to panic, and triggering an anxiety/panic attack, symptoms of which include dizziness and blurred vision...and worsened dissociation, ironically."
OpiatesRecovery,fk9cdr1,t3_fh5ex8,1583973194.0,"Like another person mentioned, learning how to cope with stress is absolutely essential to staying clean. Cognitive behavioral therapy techniques can come in handy during this time, and while they may seem simple ways of rewiring how you think, making it stick takes a lot of practice (for example, learning to think positively in times of high stress is a coping technique easier said than done). 

Making lists does help, and gives a sense of accomplishment. Even if it's just brushing your teeth, taking a shower a day, making yourself food, etc. Then slowly adding on more tasks when you feel like you can tackle them. You have to slowly integrate yourself back into a normal 'life' load. Just throwing it all back on is extremely stressful and can cause relapse easily.

Most people will be able to put two and two together, which raises more awareness without stupid people thinking you're trying to ruin someone's reputation...again, as stupid as that is, some people will believe your abuser. 

Also finding ways to get involved in criminal justice/legal system reform can give you a sense of purpose and liberate you. Even if you do not have justice for yourself, it can often help knowing that you can assist in finding justice for future survivors. 

Even just joining a group with others can be helpful, as you're helping in their healing process, as well. Learning to get past the trauma and live a happy life is one of the best 'fuck yous' I know of.

I believe many people addicted aren't just afraid of boredom but of their thoughts. Especially those of worthlessness. It's a horrible cycle that keeps going on and on until you break it.

The only thing that helped me break the cycle of using the internet/computer to distract myself was to start off with making a list of things to do that needed to be done. I'd make it a goal to finish at least 3 things on my list. Even if it was just brushing my teeth, making my bed, and taking a shower, I did them, or I would take my laptop and lock it in my safe.

After a week or two, I added more tasks. And then more, like going on a short walk, or looking up a recipe for the day and trying to cook it. If I procrastinated on doing it, the laptop would go in my safe. I'd make sure to accomplish one big goal each day, and x amount of little ones. 

As long as you always have something to do or a goal to work toward, no matter how small, I've found it makes a huge difference. You realize you are accomplishing things and it feels good. Use actual computer time to plan new goals, print out a bunch of flash cards and learn a new language, even if it's just an hour a day.

It's the main reason I'm such a strong advocate for using a fitbit or something to measure your heart rate when you work out. Especially when I've seen how many people actually UNDER report on burned calories during a workout...If you're already on a 1,200 calorie limit and burn 400-500 extra calories with your exercise, you're literally only getting 600 or so calories to fuel your actual body. It can be even worse when you realize some people might even be under THAT if they've miscalculated their TDEE and their activity level is actually higher than they thought (which happens a lot, actually). That would peg them at...yeah. Barely any calories. AKA starving themselves, so it's no wonder so many people report being so hungry.

It's literally eating disorder territory at that point and very unhealthy for no reason other than losing weight a little bit quicker.

And even though it's not always 100% accurate, it's still something people should do regardless of height. You'll genuinely feel better if you're eating the correct number of calories for fuel. That's literally what a TDEE is, the number of calories needed to fuel your meat sack. While you might burn off a little extra weight quicker not eating burned calories back, you're still more prone to binges when you're literally fucking starving.

If you're not comfortable eating back all of them, then eat at least half of them. People that refuse to eat back calories when they're already on such a low amount (especially short people who will have to maintain at such low calorie amount) are absolutely crazy to me."

I personally think it's because my body can tell it's starting to feel bad, and is looking for a while to get a quick rush of feel good hormones from the chocolate (a common reason so many women crave it during their periods, too, as it can help you feel better). 

Anyway, I'm glad you were able to figure it out!"
dogs,fhabga8,t1_fha0d5a,1581403350.0,"This is wonderful advice, OP. I completely forgot about the warning signs but yes, my dog did the exact same thing and would start acting 'strange' before a seizure would take over. 

As for my dog personally, he would usually start feeling better within a few hours but I distinctly remember his very first seizure being especially hard on him since he wasn't on medication. It took days for him to be back to himself, and even then he was still different personality wise for almost a week, wanting to be left alone, etc. 

Like mentioned, make sure your dog drinks water. Squirt some water down his mouth if he'll allow you. Seizure medicines for dogs are often the same kind humans take, and can dehydrate you terribly and cause kidney issues. If he doesn't get better, another vet visit won't hurt to check for dehydration if the lethargy doesn't go away."
dogs,fhab554,t3_f22dbl,1581403020.0,"It's normal, unfortunately. Some dogs can apparently 'grow into' their epilepsy and start having seizures as they get older. For other dogs sudden seizures may be a sign of other health issues, so hopefully you were able to get a full blood testing done. 

 I had a German Shepherd Lax mix dog that was hit by a car and start having seizures similar to what you're talking about. After that moment, he'd act lethargic for a while and then the seizure would hit. We would have to hold him in a blanket to keep him from hurting himself, as he would constantly try to walk around while having a seizure and hurt himself, or get stuck under chairs trying to find a 'comfortable' spot during his confusion from the seizure. Please make sure they did a full scan on his head to make sure there are no tumors. Otherwise if you've already done all of this, unfortunately this will just be something you have to monitor and deal with day by day.

&#x200B;

My dog's seizures were almost completely stopped with the seizure medicine, and after a while the medicine itself stopped making him so sleepy. He still had seizures here and there, but it was manageable and we invested in a good, thick blanket to hold him in during them. Keep in mind he was an almost 100lb dog, and we were still able to do it safely. So if you're comfortable holding your baby during the seizures, I'd recommend it (but absolutely do not hold him without a blanket, since they can bite unknowingly during the seizure, even if they're normally wonderful). But it's absolutely normal, due to how much it takes on you physically. I have seizures myself and it can take a few days after a bad one to feel better.

I'm so sorry your baby is having to deal with this, but outside of giving him medication and properly making sure he doesn't hurt himself during the actual seizures, there's not much you can do beyond that. 

PS: I had to give my dog his pill every single day until the day he died, 16 years later. If I missed a day, he would almost always suffer a seizure. I would genuinely suggest getting a 'Did I Feed My Dog Today' reminder board you can find on Amazon and use it for remembering your dog's medicine. Dogs are for life, and unfortunately ours just need a little more love."

socialskills,fgv0dwd,t1_fguzb7a,1581133666.0,"Personally, I think it depends on the amount of people you're around which usually plays directly into how big your store is. Kmarts were usually pretty big in my experience, and while I remember being helped, I don't think I really remember people catering to my needs or needing to follow me around to basically assist me while shopping. The store I worked at was Hot Topic and because the stores are usually so small, we typically would have only two people working during a shift (unless on weekends, we'd sometimes have three or four people). 

So we were expected to make each visit personal to drive sales up higher, interact with customers to find out what they liked, and then bring them items and basically be their personal shopper. It was honestly pretty competitive, especially once they started tracking individual sales per person and giving hours out based on how well you did to bring up the average amount spent per person. 

With big volume stores, I don't think it's as necessary or even possible to assist customers the way smaller stores do, so it really makes sense that it was easier for me. 

Regardless, you did wonderful doing what you did and it makes me happy to know retail helped someone else break out of their shell. Even just small talk is amazing, IMO."
socialskills,fguwrw9,t3_f0flm0,1581131179.0,"You're on the right track, OP.

A few months later, I realized that I didn't have the time to worry about looking like a fool in front of people with customers constantly needing attending, and just...forgot about feeling awkward.  After that, I was able to talk to rooms full of people, carry on conversations, dance outside and joke around to bring customers inside, and more. 

Getting yourself over social anxiety really does stem down to putting yourself into uncomfortable situations a LOT. Exposure therapy works so damn well for a reason, but you shouldn't beat yourself up for not realizing sooner.... who wants to be uncomfortable?

My shortness of breath turned out to be from my neck pain, which was being caused by my jaw pain (caused by jaw clenching and lip biting), which in turn was caused by my anxiety (made worse by bad sleep and caffeine) that triggered me to constantly bite my lip. It was a vicious cycle.

Over a year of my TMJ, the neck pain got so bad I started getting migraines, dizziness, mental confusion, etc. I was finally able to get it under control by keeping track of my symptoms in a journal and narrowing down what I was doing, then slowly eliminating each thing until I saw results. Obviously everyone is different, but a journal is a great starting place to figuring things out and it changed my life.

You have a giant muscle that runs along your ear, jaw and into your neck. Even something that might seem small to you can exacerbate your TMJ, so please make sure to take note of whatever you can think of to try to get to the root issue. Like I said, I 100% recommend keeping a journal these next few weeks while you wait to be seen. It can help your doctor from running around, too, as so many TMJ symptoms can mimic other illnesses. The journal will help you prove which TMJ symptoms are causing other symptoms, and in turn offer possible solutions.

I've worked crime and trauma scene clean up and it's never depicted correctly; I have so many people absolutely gobsmacked when they lose a loved one and realize police don't do everything for them, that sometimes they have to pay thousands to have someone clean the crime/trauma scene if insurance doesn't cover it.

If you stick to around 1,200 calories and get 10,000 steps a day in, you should have no problem losing weight pretty consistently... You'd lose even quicker if you were to stick firmly to 1,200 and not deviate to around 1,400 unless you can burn off those extra 200 calories.

I'm 5'2 and still losing weight on 1,200 calories a day with minimum exercising; you're taller than me so it should definitely still be working for you, too. I only lose about a lb a week, about 4lbs a month, and I'm currently at 139lbs, down from around 160ish lbs. Again, your weight loss is just taking longer because as you lose weight, your maintenance calories get smaller and so does the deficit needed to lose a lb of weight a week (which would be 3,500 calories a week, or 500 calories per day).

As another petite woman focusing on 1,200, I'm sure you've already heard it before but I'm going to absolutely stress that you buy a food scale and learn to measure your food if you haven't already. It's literally been a game changer for me this time around. In the past I would always lose the weight I wanted, but put it back on because I wasn't measuring and eating a lot more than I thought (seriously, finding out how small an actual serving of peanut butter is was literally heart breaking for me). Eye-balling food is not good enough, neither is taking packaged food calories at their word. 

Not counting calories correctly seems to be the biggest flaw most petite women run into, as even a small amount of calories over can add up over the week and cause a weight plateau or gain. 

**That being said,** honestly, the best workout depends on your personal preference and how you want to end up looking. Using weights will help you look thinner even if you weigh a bit more, as obviously muscle is heavier than fat. I'm personally doing about 2-3 days of weight lifting/strength training a week, and alternating every other day with cardio (averaging about 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity cardio, so 30-45 minutes of cardio 3-4 times a week). I typically play DDR to get my cardio in and have been using free hand weights. I've already noticed this time around of losing the weight that my body looks smaller due to the muscle I'm building. I'm also doing what I can to incorporate more protein in my diet with protein powder meal replacements, and it's not only helped with staving off hunger, but for the first time ever I can actually see arm muscles, haha. 

If you need help getting started with weight lifting, r/xxfitness has a lot of great help and resources. I've personally been using \[this site for some beginning tips\]([https://shefit.com/blogs/shefit-blog/kettlebell-workout-for-women-a-full-body-routine-for-beginners](https://shefit.com/blogs/shefit-blog/kettlebell-workout-for-women-a-full-body-routine-for-beginners)) but there are a ton of really good ones to incorporate into your routine.

Sorry if I gave you any repetitive info, but hopefully you can do this! Just remember to stick to it, as petite girls tend to lose weight slower....really, really slow. \*sob\*"
GriefSupport,fej3ad3,t3_ep39f8,1579155286.0,"I lost my father a few months ago to suicide and I'm the one who found him. It was all so sudden...I firmly believe the way you lost your mother was in ways similar to my loss, as we both didn't have time to come to terms with it. There was no time to say goodbye. This makes grieving very difficult, more so than normal. However, I'll let you know that it does get easier. 

Do what you can and focus on getting through the next few weeks. You're not going to be able to sort your emotions because you're going to be hit with so many, you won't even know what you're feeling. Save the sorting for later. Right now, let yourself feel and cry and mourn. Everything will remind you of her, and it will be like that for quite a long time. It'll get easier to cope with once you've had proper time to process things as it was so sudden. 

Also, I'm not sure about your religious beliefs, but if you're planning on having a funeral, focus on taking part in putting together the ceremony. I personally did what I could to pick out flowers, pictures my father would have liked displayed, putting together a memory book for guests to write memories of my father, etc.

PS: something else that also helped was starting a fundraiser to donate to charity for suicide prevention/support for families affected by suicide loss. I'm not sure if your mom had a certain illness that caused her breathing issues, but if so, a fundraiser for awareness can help give you something to do that will help tremendously with coping.

I would also recommend finding a support group and looking into coping skills for dealing with sudden losses... losing a family member/loved one is hard enough, but grief becomes a lot more complex when the death is sudden and/or out of nowhere.

I'm wishing you the best during this dark time of your life, OP. I hope you find strength and light by focusing on the good memories of your mother."

1200isplenty,fehru3a,t1_fegr5qv,1579122620.0,"Do you mind if I ask how much time it took you to lose that first initial weight of 150 to 110? And did you exercise at all or was it strictly from counting calories? I'm about 140 atm and just started properly calorie counting, but I'm not sure if I need to up my physical activity or not as I'm pretty inactive. I just wanted to get a guesstimate on how long it will possibly take me, so I don't get discouraged if the weight doesn't come off as quickly as I'd like. Losing weight seems easy at first, but there's really a lot more to it than I first thought, haha."
AskReddit,fdpb6bj,t3_emjmh5,1578624263.0,"High on opiates and feeling deeply ashamed, since I just got through detox about two months ago.

I'm being monitored atm so I'm not worried about a full blown relapse, but it still sucks.

CPTSD,fdhgaij,t3_el6or3,1578422021.0,"Sorry in advance for the long response, but it gets better, I promise. After years of suffering from my CPTSD and my father abusing me mentally by threatening to kill himself, he finally went and killed himself and blamed me for it. My life spiraled for a long ass time and so did my health, mental and physical. I got severely addicted to drugs and went to rehab recently, I'm sure the drugs didn't help my stress/skin. I couldn't even get out of bed, my face was sunken and bruised, my eyes literally looked like someone had punched me in them from how tired I was...literally always tired, no matter how much sleep I got...I didn't leave my house for almost two years before starting therapy. I finally found someone that specialized in my kind of abuse, and after starting cognitive behavioral therapy with a therapist I actually clicked with, I started gaining back motivation and lessening my stress levels. Stress and depression ages your skin, so fucking much it's insane. However, thankfully, a lot of it can be reversible. It took me months of learning to rethink positively to actually get my stress levels down, but it worked and I honestly recommend CBT to people any chance I get. It seems simple in retrospect, but in actual practice it takes time and patience but the results are...yeah. Worth it IMO. I had to slowly work my way back into a simple care routine (depression made it hard to even bath every other day), but once I did I started feeling my skin change and my motivation come back. I honestly didn't realize just how much looking bad made my mental health worse, but it did.

I'm still working on reversing the effects my severe stress has had on my body and health, mostly my skin, but it's happening and my skin looks fucking awesome in comparison now. I still have enlarged pores and have to force myself to drink more water, but it's gotten easier. Drinking green tea helped me with my skin AND stress, especially once I started forcing myself into a routine. Doing that routine felt like an accomplishment and I started adding other things onto it, slowly. I got into korean skin care (although the 9+ step korean skin care routines are just ways to get you to buy tons of products, they have a great subreddit for taking care of your skin) and right now I'm going to stress that you GET SUNSCREEN. It works miracles for men AND women, lol. Getting a good face serum to put on problem areas is key, too. I had a ton of wrinkles that turned out to be from severe dehydration, that are now gone after consistently drinking enough water. Drinking well for a day or two isn't enough, it can take weeks to fix the effects of severe dehydration, so drink, drink, DRINK.

TL;DR: It's going to take time, but please don't give up. Start a simple routine, even if it starts out with just 'drink water, take a shower, do one chore'."

HealthAnxiety,fcjl6c0,t3_ehfe0p,1577692141.0,"Sounds like what I go through when I have panic attacks. With panic attacks, the best way to get through it is to learn how to calm and ground yourself and come to terms with the fact that you're going to feel the anxiety. You have to go through it to feel better, and just know that once the anxiety goes away you'll be fine. Which is easier said than done, especially for us folk with health anxiety that keep dreading it to happen again. But you're safe and you're okay, panic attacks cannot kill you. I'm so sorry it happened to you all the same, I've had some triggered from dizziness myself, I usually realized I was dizzy, felt a shot of panic that something might be wrong with my health, and then bam, panic attack. The more you realize what's going on, the less they'll happen."

AskWomen,fc5xwp5,t3_eg7srq,1577468191.0,"I went from being ignored or bullied to people literally stalking me for attention. When I was young and fat, it was like I was invisible. When I finally dropped weight and started dressing well, it was like a switch got flipped and I was suddenly getting attention. For a while I still thought men were making fun of me, but I started getting people bringing me things like gifts, food or flowers at work and it suddenly clicked that they were actually trying to woo me. I still struggle with accepting it, however, as I have a lot of guys that obviously don't want to get to know me and I'm hyper aware of the fact that if I were heavier, they wouldn't be giving me the time of day. Obviously not all guys, but a lot of the ones I've had the displeasure of knowing have been like this and it sucks.

Something else I noticed is that I get approached by mothers a lot, too. I went swimming once and had a mom approach me and make up some excuse about her son being shy and needing me to 'show him around'. He had told his mom he liked me and she was trying to play match maker...It was awkward as hell. So I have that happen a lot, along with a lot of older people more prone to approach me telling me they think I'm beautiful or just talking to me out in public and feeling like I care about their day. It was cute at first but now it's annoying because I can't leave my house without someone trying to talk to me.

I also get a lot of free items when I've been shopping over the last few years. Stuff that I know wouldn't happen if I were still younger. 

Edit: I've also noticed that I get better care from doctors than I used to, as I've grown up having brain surgeries and have been in and out of the hospital most of my life. I've also gotten hit on by EMT's, to where I checked out of the hospital early because of one guy stalking me and asking me out. Looking back on things, it was really, really weird..."

She'll stop mocking you real quick if it's going to make her look silly, haha. I used to do this to my cousin when she would do this to me and she stopped real fast. But other than that, it does sound like you're extra frustrated at her due to your situation. I was the same way when living in a two bedroom apartment with over 8 people.

I'm so sorry for your loss, OP. It really does truly fucking suck ass."
