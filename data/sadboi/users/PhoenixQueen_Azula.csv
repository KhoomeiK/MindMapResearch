The marshall one actually seems like it might be useful though. The hipfire is surprisingly accurate on it. I guess you could technically do it after scoped shots too, though the benefit seems pretty minimal in that case."

It might even be beneficial for her to remove her armor like against lancer for more mobility and evasion. Vader's not Anakin, while he does use heavy slashes he is a very methodical duelist and his style is far more nuanced than that. While he couldn't just choke her or toss her about due to the magic resist, he is extremely strong in the force and could likely have some effect, even if it's something like tearing the ground shes standing on out from under her."

However, he really has no defense if she unleashes Excalibur. His suit has been shown vulnerable to regular electricity, I’m not seeing him withstand that blast. He’d have to find some way to avoid it, using shirou as a human shield or something but that’s not a straight duel at that point"
