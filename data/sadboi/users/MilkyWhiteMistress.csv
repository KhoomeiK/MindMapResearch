I think that continuing to seek out professional help is a good way to go, to help in the long run. In the short term, helping her find outlets for her emotions can help as well. I was really into art and music and those things helped me to express my feelings enough where those urges would become less and less. See if there are any clubs or sports she would be interested in.

It's okay if you're just surviving through today. Focus on getting through an hour or two, take things a day at a time. Feel free to send me a message if you need to talk."
CatAdvice,esev8p5,t3_c7fwhz,1561910379.0,"I'm American, and though I don't speak for everyone, I think of myself as a good cat owner.

There are plenty of cats that don't want to be outside or feel anxious outside. My boy won't even try to escape with the door wide open. There are also areas that have high feral cat populations so having indoor cats helps with keeping those populations down.

While declawing used to be relatively popular, numbers have declined. There are very few vets that will perform this procedure anymore.

I personally don't have a collar for my cat, but I know people who do simply because they allow their cats time outside and don't want their pet to be considered a stray and taken to a shelter. A lot of times they don't even mind having one on, as every cat is different. My boy hates them but I know other cats that don't care about them at all.

I'm not going to comment on the shooting thing because I feel that's ridiculous.
I also don't know enough about cats and bird populations, as my cat is exclusively indoor so it's not something I've ever thought about.

As for feeding them ""pebbles"", the dry food I feed my cat is made from meat products. I also feed him wet food that is just meat with gravy. There are plenty of food options available that are healthy for cats to eat.

There are plenty of good and loving cat owners here in the US. I feel that generalizing an entire country is unfair and a lot of these statements only account for a small fraction of people/owners here."
