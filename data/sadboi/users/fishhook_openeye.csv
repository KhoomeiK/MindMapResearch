predaddit,fizbi13,t1_fik35hx,1582858694.0,"^^^^This 1,000x over! I'm a new mom (6 month old) and the father has not been around hardly at all to help with raising our child. He provides financially but that's it. BE THERE IN ANY WAY YOU CAN. It makes a world of difference. Our relationship has dwindled because of his absence and seeming unwillingness to help with the basics of parenthood (just being around). Be there. And even if she doesn't get romantically involved with you again, think of the amazing bond you're going to have with your child by being a stable figure in his life."

emotionalabuse,fcwab4p,t3_ej4e5z,1578020776.0,"I could have written most of this about my current SO! Him intentionally pissing me off by teasing me in ways I've said for years hurts my feelings and then him telling me I'm not allowing him to be himself/forcing him to live a humorless existence/crushing him as a man. He's accused me of gaslighting him when I don't remember things or an having trouble following a story he's telling. Anytime I say my feelings are hurt, it turns into an argument in which I am ripped to shreds. Me telling him that he's hurt my feelings makes me the bad guy. He always goes on about how I'm not meeting his needs (only brings this up during arguments).  And I've turned into a person in not proud of. My temper in non-existent with him and I'm rude as fuck when we argue sometimes. I relate so much to your post and YES, IT IS EMOTIONAL ABUSE. YOU'RE FEELINGS ARE VALID."

BPD,fcomn0b,t3_ei67xo,1577836050.0,"You are not alone in feeling this way. I'm sitting next to you in that boat. My outbursts are minimal. I go to therapy weekly and here I am, still experiencing inner anguish. I can keep it from bleeding onto other people but then I'm left wondering why I'm hiding my emotional bloody mess? It's painfully isolating but at the same time, there's a comfort there bc I know I won't experience emotional upset. You're not alone. And I hope peace can find us both. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

Sometimes I can feel it start to happen and literally say to myself, ""Here we go again..."" and watch the whole thing snowball. I don't even feel like an active participant in it, yet I emotionally feel like I'm being burned alive. 

Any advice that helps you personally?"
BPD,fcof329,t1_fcoarqn,1577830695.0,"My last relationship burned me pretty fucking bad on regards to trusting online acquaintances. I was so blind. My ex was CONSISTENTLY sexting multiple girls throughout our entire relationship. I didn't connect the dots until about 1.5 years in. I feel like it has permanently scarred me on top of having lifelong trust issues with anyone, not just romantic partners. 

I get so hung up on my idea of perfect, too. I'm the biggest bully to myself. And have these unattainably high standards for myself and myself only. Ughhhh."
