Anxiety,fpbprrf,t1_fpavv6w,1588475684.0,"Aw yeah, that’s not helpful at all (your therapist). Is there anyone else you can see? A therapist outside of your school? One of the most important things with therapy is to find someone who you feel comfortable with, who understands you and helps you in a way that works for you. Sometimes it can take a while to find a good therapist... but it’s worth it."
Anxiety,fpab4xv,t3_gc37dc,1588444506.0,"I completely understand this feeling. It’s so easy to think negatively about ourselves and immediately jump to the worst conclusions. It sounds like you’re trying to socialize sometimes, and that’s good! It takes a lot of practice though and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone. And that can be really, really hard - not gonna lie. It will feel uncomfortable and weird. You will doubt yourself. But it will get just that tiniest bit easier each time. The first step is just making yourself do it. 

People may feel uncomfortable around you because they can sense that you yourself are uncomfortable. So if you practice socializing, even just saying hi to people, it can help to slowly build up some confidence. This sounds cheesy, but you could try having pretend conversations in the mirror or writing down topics to talk about, so you feel more prepared to talk to people. I always feel better when I have some idea of what I want to say to people. 

Are you in school? It sounds to me like you are, correct me if I’m wrong. If you have a school counselor or other mental health resources available to you I would recommend using them. It can only help. Social anxiety is really hard to get over, I struggle with it every day, but therapy has helped me. Hang in there!! We are always here to help."

Just reminding myself that I’m here in the moment, and I’m safe in my body, and that this feeling may suck but it’s temporary."
Anxiety,fkzpkse,t3_eupik4,1584676785.0,I just found out that yesterday I was briefly in the same room as someone at work whose relative tested positive for COVID-19. Apparently he saw the relative on Saturday and just found out today about them testing positive. While the risk is probably low for me (I was on his floor/in his area for literally a minute or less) I’m still feeling worried about it. I’ve been washing my hands at work whenever I touch something outside of my cubicle or if someone hands me something and I’ve been keeping to myself so I hope I’ll be okay. My boss is having me stay home tomorrow just in case. They were supposed to have a laptop ready for me today so I could start working from home but that didn’t happen. I’m mad that my coworker came in to work even though he has the ability to work from home. I’m anxious that I won’t be able to visit my parents for a long time and that I might miss my mom’s birthday next week. Bleh :(

Anxiety,fknpv19,t3_fjl86j,1584371383.0,"I’m sorry that you’re having such a hard time. One of the things that anxiety does is tell us that we won’t be able to cope. Try to think back on other hard times you’ve had and how you copes with them. You got through that, and you get through this! You said that you spoke with a psychologist on your base - maybe they would have suggestions on where you can go to get some quiet time alone. An empty office or meeting room or something, where you can close your eyes and breathe. You may feel trapped, and maybe you won’t be able to leave the base, but you will get out at the end of this. Just try to take things one day at a time."

Personally I’ve mostly just been reading this thread and also keeping my eye out for local updates.

But all they are are thoughts - not the truth. It’s your brain being mean to you. My suggestion is that if you’re able to afford therapy, 100% give it a try. A good therapist will help you work through the negative thinking you are experiencing, especially with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). But if you can’t afford therapy or even in the meantime, maybe look into some CBT apps or even youtube videos. It’s all about recognizing your negative thoughts and challenging them. 

I hope that you can be kind to yourself instead of beating yourself up. You have so much life ahead of you and you CAN work through it and overcome this rough patch. But I’m not gonna lie, it will take hard work on your part. Sometimes it really sucks. But the results are more rewarding than the pain of not trying.

To me there’s nothing worse in a job than feeling like you’re worthless there. I would say definitely look for another job. As far as it looking bad on your resume goes - prospective employers won’t necessarily think that, especially if you have a good reason to leave like in this job. If they want to know more about your short tenure at your jobs they will ask, and so be prepared to answer honestly. Imo people can’t be expected anymore to stay at a job just for longevity’s sake.

Anyway, I fully support you in finding something new, but in the meantime I hope you can hang in there. <3"
Anxiety,fgeake8,t3_exx6jc,1580695151.0,"Yep. It sucks because I tend to get anxious at work and my workplace can get pretty noisy. When my anxiety is high it’s very difficult for me to tolerate all of the noise around me! Sometimes even trying to listen to music or podcasts irritates me too. Usually when this happens I try and find an empty meeting room or even go in my car and do a crossword puzzle or read for awhile. If I can’t get away, I have earplugs AND noise cancelling headphones on hand if I need them."
Anxiety,fdasbmw,t1_fd93rnt,1578249468.0,"Hey. If your anxiety over public speaking is causing you to suffer, it doesn’t matter if it’s “bad enough” of an anxiety. It is causing you distress, and that is what matters, not comparing yourself to others. Treat yourself with a little kindness. <3

I also wanted to say that showing up buzzed or drunk to your presentations is not the way to go. Relying on alcohol to ease your anxiety is not a great coping strategy. Not judging you, just warning. I don’t want you to hurt yourself. 

I read this website about public speaking anxiety and it seems to be really helpful: https://nationalsocialanxietycenter.com/social-anxiety/public-speaking-anxiety/. I have troubles with public speaking too, but luckily I rarely have to do it. What I have found most helpful is to practice a LOT, with myself and also in front of a willing person who is safe to you (friend, family member). Writing down your worries might help as well. Also learning some breathing exercises for beforehand or even just noticing your breathing during the presentation to make aure you are taking even, deep breaths. You got this. I hope that you can work through this. We are all here for you."
Anxiety,fb3bzjx,t3_eb4sb7,1576469099.0,"It sounds like you are having a really hard time. I’m sorry that you’ve been dealing with so much. Anxiety over health issues is a tricky beast. I haven’t had quite the same experience as you, but I have had several episodes of health anxiety in the past. One time I was convinced that I had Celiac disease, and even though the blood tests came back clear, I still went through with an intestinal biopsy which came back clear as well. So I had to come to accept that I just have general IBS and learned to avoid/eat less of my trigger foods. A couple of years after this, I thought for sure I had sleep apnea. I was always tired and falling asleep at my desk at work. I did a preliminary test at home that came back inconclusive, so I did a full overnight sleep study. Which came back negative for sleep apnea or any other sleep disorder. Looking back on this time, I realize that I was really depressed and the exhaustion came from that. 

I’m not trying to say that it’s all in your head, because it’s always possible that there is some underlying health condition causing your symptoms. But it also could be anxiety and/or depression causing your symptoms. I really understand how frustrating it can be, not knowing one way or another. 

Are you currently seeing a therapist? You mentioned a psychiatrist but if you’re not also in therapy I really, really would recommend it if you are able to afford it. Being able to talk to a professional has helped me immensely, on top of taking medication. It really sucks to have such anxious thoughts, especially to the point of not wanting to be here anymore. But I really hope that you can find some support and some peace of mind. We are always here on this subreddit to support you too!"

Anxiety,famnrhg,t3_e9xkgv,1576208293.0,"HUG!!!!

Is there anyone else that you can tell about your anxiety? Another family member or trusted adult? A school counselor? It sounds to me like you would really benefit from having someone to talk to. You might even try to bring it up with your mom again. Maybe try writing out your thoughts and show her how you’ve been feeling. I hope that someone in your life will take you seriously because mental health is just as important as physical health and just as deserving of treatment. Just know that your now isn’t your forever. You can work through this. Anxiety tries to tell us that it’s hopeless, but it’s really not. There is always hope! We are all here on this subreddit to support you as well. 

Also, it’s totally normal to have fears, even if your brain tries to tell you they are embarassing. I don’t much like the dark either. Even as an adult I sometimes have to sleep with a lamp on because my mind won’t stop telling me there’s something lurking in the darkness. It’s just something that I deal with. I look at it as a fear of the unknown. When you look at it that way, it’s completely understandable! The unknown can be scary! But if it bothers you enough to cause you distress then it’s something that you could also talk to someone about as well. Sleep is really important and I always find that my anxiety increases with lack of sleep. These brains of ours just need some rest!"

It’s okay to not be okay. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious and overwhelmed. I get anxious/depressed around this time of year too. Currently going through it. I try to remind myself that my today isn’t my forever. These times will pass. Even though it fucking sucks and I don’t want to be feeling this way right now, I know that it will pass. Please try and be kind to yourself. Reach out and talk to a loved one if you can. Watch some calming youtube videos. Get some rest - I know that my anxiety always gets worse when I don’t get enough sleep. I know that you can get through this, and people on this subreddit will always be here to support you too."

Other than that... try to breathe. Search youtube for mindfulness or grounding guided videos and try one.

We did an exercise where we started with a list of 54 values and had to narrow it down to the six most important to us. It was surprisingly hard! But it makes sense to me that if you focus on living your life based on your values then you will tend to have a more fulfilling life. And to think to yourself “Am I living in accordqnce to my values?” when faced with a struggle. For example I have major social anxiety but one of my strongest values is friendship/close relationships with people. When I find myself anxious and wanting to avoid social interaction, it helps to remind myself that I value friendship and interpersonal connections, which I can’t do if I avoid people. So I have to be prepared to experience some discomfort in order to live my life based on those values. 

Our therapist leading the class also showed us this video which I thought was helpful in explaining it: https://youtu.be/T-lRbuy4XtA"

I stay up late a lot because I’m too anxious about the next day, or even if there’s nothing in particular happening the next day I worry that I’ll “waste” the current day by going to sleep, if that makes any sense. The only success that I’ve had is to force myself to go to bed. Pick a bedtime and try to stick with it. Try to read or something else low key and hour or so before bed - not on your phone. If you have trouble falling asleep there are a lot of relaxation apps that can help. I always find that white noise helps me.
