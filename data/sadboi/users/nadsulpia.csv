I think some people believe being pale is a choice. Now when people make comments about needing more sun or suggesting I should try tanning I usually just say “I’d rather not look like a leather hand bag by the time I’m 40.” One time I told a man at work, who said I needed more sun, that I was a ghost because I wanted him to be weirded out and stop talking to me."

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fhua44n,t3_f4oyds,1581883918.0,"I’ve been in this type of situation twice. The first time was at an old job I had. This guy I worked with wouldn’t leave me alone. I made sure to never give him any reason to think I was interested in him. He made me uncomfortable but I felt like it wasn’t fair to say anything to him if he just had a crush on me. Eventually people I worked with started to notice and told me he would talk to them about me when I wasn’t around. He looked at my work schedule to see when we worked together. He even messaged some people we worked with to tell them I got a haircut. It was weird. I eventually told my manager. HR got involved and he was fired. I felt super guilty because I just wanted him to leave me alone, I never wanted to have him fired. He was fired because apparently it had been an issue with other girls before I started working there and he had been given some warnings. 

The next time this happened to me was at school. It didn’t last long because I put a stop to it right away. It was a guy who was in my program. I met him on the first day of class and by the end of the week he was asking to phone me to just talk. I tried really hard to make it clear I wasn’t interested in him. He would text me non stop and if I ignored the texts he would question me about it. He would try to isolate me from meeting other people by asking to sit with me far away from other people in our class. One day we were at school and he told me he was going to go get some lunch but when he did it he touched me arm in a really creepy way. The way you would touch someone if you were dating them. I felt like yelling “I DONT GIVE A SHIT IF YOU ARE GETTING LUNCH DONT TOUCH ME”. When he came back I told him I didn’t want to be friends anymore (not that I ever considered him a friend). It was hard to be that honest to someone’s face but I’m glad I did it. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings but some people don’t know how to take a hint."

So I’m only considering the cost of gas. Parking is free for me. With some distances transit is cheaper but most of the time it is cheaper to just pay for gas. I don’t think it should be this way.

Transit is more convenient for where I need to go but the prices are way to high. I have class once a week downtown and it costs me almost $7 to get there and back. If it weren’t for the price of parking it would be cheaper to drive, even with the ridiculous gas prices. I’m sure a good majority of transit users have monthly passes but for people who want to use it occasionally it is not worth the cost. If we are wanting to move towards less people driving for environmental reasons transit needs to be more financially appealing so people can’t justify the cost of driving."

She put all the kids into a playroom and left and spent her time in other parts of the house where kids weren’t allowed. There was a baby, maybe one year old, in a car seat. I loved babies when I was that age so this is why this memory has always stuck with me. I remember some of the other kids turning over the car seat while the baby was still strapped in. I remember telling this woman what they did but nothing ever happened. I don’t think she believed me. 

Now she is no longer doing daycare. She isn’t allowed. She had a baby die at her daycare due to neglect. She went to prison.

I honestly can not think of a single woman I know who doesn’t love when their partner does stuff on their own. Women like free time too.

I can guarantee you there are adults on this earth that produce enough waste equal to what a group of kids do and those are the people that are the problem.

They are not going to be King and Queen and yet they spend money like they are. Harry grew up in that family and understands how the relationship between the media and his family works but with Meghan wanting so much privacy (when it works for her) it seems like she only wants the benefits of being royal without giving anything in return.

pics,f0o3y2o,t1_f0noikg,1568793783.0,I don’t disagree with you but if I were an innocent person that was going to spend the rest of my life in jail I think I would prefer to just be killed. I can’t even begin to imagine how frustrating it would be to be innocent and in jail.
WhatsWrongWithYourDog,f0o1edy,t1_f0n4htn,1568789762.0,"You say in your experience abused dogs attempt to escape their owners? How do you have experience with this? Dogs are extremely loyal animals even when they have abusive owners. 

Obviously we will never know how this dog was trained to do this but even with positive reinforcement this is abuse in my eyes. Most decent dog owners would know this is not good for a dogs hips and that the dog is likely not getting any enjoyment out of it. I hate to sound like some crazy PETA person but animals are not meant for entertainment."

MasterReturns,eznlxe9,t1_ezlbyi7,1568007931.0,If you can afford it you could find a dog daycare. I’ve sent my dog to a daycare for a few nights while I’ve been on vacation and the place he goes to posts photos everyday on their Facebook page so the owners can see their dogs. They also just do regular daycare too for people who work away from home. It’s nice because I can tell from my dogs face in the photos that he loves it which makes me feel better leaving him there.

IWantToLearn,ez3ntt7,t3_czm2ah,1567671286.0,Pay attention to how the person treats everyone in their life. Someone might seem really nice but if they are constantly talking shit about some other people it likely means they will do the same to you.

AskWomen,ez24sso,t1_ez0ls7h,1567652582.0,"I come from a family with large age gaps and I love it. You got to spend most of your daughters childhood just focusing on her and enjoying that time of her life, now she will be growing up and you can focus more of your time on your son. If the timing works out for the woman to have large age gaps I think it’s great!"
AskWomen,ez230az,t1_ez0xdbt,1567652397.0,I’m tired of questions like this too but mostly because I want to do more with my life than just have a career. I don’t know why we are supposed to be excited about being a slave to a job for the next 40 years. I guess some people really enjoy their work but I think the majority of people are in a job purely to pay the bills.
AskWomen,ez21vcx,t1_ez0qurm,1567652058.0,I think sometimes you have to be brutally honest to people to make them realize they shouldn’t always ask those types of questions.
