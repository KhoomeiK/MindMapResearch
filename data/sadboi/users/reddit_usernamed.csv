In terms of side effects, I got a really bad tremor in my hands but then I stoped splitting the dose and taking it all before bed. That helps kinda sleep through the worst of it. I also get pretty bad “brain fog” but it’s hard to say that Lithium is doing this and not my antipsychotic.

I had my first depressive episode around 12. Then my first manic/mixed episode at 14. Not a lot of symptoms through teenage years that didn’t just appear to be a teenager with “issues”. 

Then I joined the military and Jebus, was that a wild ride! By the end of my enlistment I had a doctor thinking I was bipolar, asked me questions, but never gave me the diagnosis.

Meanwhile, I’m ruining my life every few years. Lots of drinking and drug use to get by. I left the military and went straight to college because I didn’t know what else to do with my life.

Made it through engineering school and started working for a big tech company. I was so restless and hated the job. So I jump to another job then another, always paranoid of getting fired or pissing people off.

I move to a smaller company and the biggest depressive episode of my life hits. I start seeing doctors and getting the same runaround, childhood trauma, blah blah, take these SSRI’s. I get to a good doctor and have open dialogue. I start doing my own research and holy shit, I’m bipolar. Brought that to my psychologist and she agreed 100%.

2) not really a good way to go about this. Encourage him, but never ask if he’s taken them when he’s acting out. I know, that is exactly when you wanna ask, but just don’t. My wife and I have a mental check-in twice a day near med time, that’s when she asks but that is the time I said it was ok to ask me. 

3) Mania can last several weeks or just a few days but not always followed by depression, but usually. I’m Bipolar 1 so mania for me can last weeks and hypomania for months. Depression for me can nearly last a year.

4) Best advice, educate him and yourself about Bipolar and the treatments for it. Tons of books out there like the ‘Bipolar Survival Guide’. 

He has to be able to accept that he needs meds and therapy for the rest of his life. He’s gotta treat it like someone with a heart condition that needs meds to keep living. 

Bipolar doesn’t define who he is and he will need to learn how to live with it. Therapy is huge! I can’t stress that enough. Meds will level you off and you can continue on but you’ll still have problems until you learn the right tools in therapy to handle whatever life throws at you.

Tell him to join r/bipolar and r/bipolarreddit, they’re very supportive communities."
BipolarReddit,fcl1ag7,t1_fcl0zs4,1577737641.0,"I have had a GP prescribe my antipsychotic before. It was like a 1 time deal, and he said he wasn’t comfortable doing it since I should have been under the care of a psychiatrist, but he understood the situation and did it for me. 

But you’re right, they generally don’t do that. But it’s worth a shot, right? What’s the worst they can say? No, then you’re still in the same spot you’re in now. It won’t getting any worse."
BipolarReddit,fcl0q4z,t3_ehr4i7,1577737291.0,"It might be easier to get in with a new primary care doctor who could temporarily prescribe for you. It’s easier to find a GP taking patients and have earlier available openings than trying to get in with a new psychiatrist. 

The uninsured part, do you qualify for government assistance? That might speed things along. 

I wish you the best of luck!"
BipolarReddit,fcl0e5l,t1_fckzb5i,1577737085.0,"This doesn’t always work and can be a very expensive means of doing so. But hey, we need our meds and if this is your only option then do it, for sure."

bipolar,fcabsde,t1_fcabipa,1577566337.0,"Thanks! I’ve gone over 20 years misdiagnosed, trying this and trying that but never an actual combo made for bipolar. Like I’ve had antipsychotics but not mood stabilizers. SSRI’s make me straight manic, it’s been a rough life. I, too, have quit on meds many times.

Best of luck to you!"
bipolar,fca3a9h,t1_fca2ve8,1577562457.0,Thanks!
bipolar,fc9yxp6,t1_fc9xwas,1577560295.0,Thanks! I’ll check out Dailyo. I like the idea of showing the doctor something because I usually feel like I’m not communicating with them well anyways.
bipolar,fc9wzsa,t1_fc9wo48,1577559440.0,Thank you so much! I’m new to this stuff and I’m thankful for all the tips I can get.
bipolar,fc9vmsv,t1_fc9vczw,1577558873.0,"I’m just terrible at remembering to even enter the stuff into eMoods! I should turn the notifications on, might help 😂"
bipolar,fc9v4xc,t1_fc9tglk,1577558666.0,"Thank you, this is really helpful. I started doing some journaling when I went through IOP, I don’t know why I didn’t think to include some mood/symptom check-ins for myself, that’s a great idea."
Traeger,fc0iwvl,t3_efie2d,1577291839.0,Is there a glaze? If there’s a glaze I probably wouldn’t wrap it. Otherwise when trying new recipes I tend to just stick to the recipe.
bipolar,fbzm6ji,t3_efca7c,1577251459.0,Thanks! I haven’t thought about the Stoics in a while and I like how you brought in the CBT. I hope you can get some sleep soon!
BipolarReddit,fbvddea,t3_eeok5p,1577129195.0,"I’m really sorry you’ve been going through this, I can relate after being misdiagnosed for about 20 years before finding the right doctor and the right med combo.

My only suggestion would be to get together with your pill doc and lay all of this out for them and let them know what’s going on. You might just be under medicated."
bipolar,fbu88vx,t1_fbu7vgh,1577109657.0,"Me too, I’ll cycle through half of my Steam library during an episode."
