And that says nothing of all of the shady business practices it promotes.

Wanna tax rich people more? Then tax rich people more. This roundabout business of taxing corporations ends up impacting poor people, too. If regulating businesses requires tax dollars, then charge them excise fees equal to those costs."

It's clean. Traffic is never stop-and-go outside of accidents during rush hour. Costco, Walmart, and Whole Foods equivalents are within a 5 minute drive. A few top quality mom and pop restaurants within 5 minutes, and the popular (urban) restaurants/events are about 20 minutes away thanks to the excellent freeway. I can own and use a grill whenever I feel like it. My back yard is large, which has been great lately. I have two big dogs. I can yell at the top of my lungs in my house and my neighbors can't hear me. Can't smell my ganja, either.

My neighbors are all middle class, so our walking-distance schools do well and crime is low. The last time I was stolen from was 12 years ago, and that was in a curbside car with the doors unlocked for a whole weekend. I only see beggars when I head into the city. It's about a 30 minute drive to reach the desert where it's legal to shoot my guns willy-nilly. About an hour to reach great campgrounds, the ski slopes, and hunting/fishing spots. If I don't want to see or hear another human being, all I have to do is not walk out the front door.

Downsides: Strip malls, maybe? That's where the delicious mom and pop restaurants are, though. Most neighborhoods have a strip mall within walking distance. HOAs sometimes suck I guess, but my last place didn't even have one, and this one hasn't spoken to me despite setting up a swingset and a gazebo in my back yard."

Just cut taxes, increase spending, and blame immigrants, democrats, and the ""main stream media"" (which is defined by and excludes the most popular news network, of course).

I'm hopeful that the moderate rebellion will be enough to give Biden a landslide just like it did with Democrats, so that they can learn from this mistake, change their primary rules (away from winner take all), and avoid another inept crazy person hijacking their party."

It's the difference between putting Fauci up at the NIAID and putting fucking Ben Carson up at HUD, or a dumbass like Rick Perry up as Secretary of Energy, or your god damn son-in-law in charge of middle eastern diplomatic initiatives.

Obviously there are different political opinions, but there is a fundamental competence that *should* be required for these positions, and a level of intelligence that we *should* expect from people being put in charge of programs worth billions of taxpayer dollars."

AOC,fod3oln,t1_fobmvzu,1587679447.0,"Biden has moved even further left now that he's won, perhaps to the point of hurting his chances in the general. He keeps doing it, too. I mean, look at what he's supporting:

* $15 minimum wage
* Climate change legislation
* Stricter gun control
* LGBT rights (he was the first major pol to come out in favor of gay marriage)
* Free community college
* Warren's bankruptcy plan (he endorsed it)
* Public Option

Those are all extremely progressive, and that's just off the top of my head. I don't even know how you can look at that and think that progressives are being ignored by the Democratic party. Pretty much all of those ideas were openly mocked by both parties in 2008. This is a massive overton shift to the left and treating it like a loss or a betrayal is just not backed by evidence."

Mick Mulvaney was our one-man executive branch, and now that he's gone, it's just a fat, narcissistic dumbass Tweeting out military orders while Manuchin continues to ""fairly distribute"" tax dollars. Reminder that the $2 trillion bailout splits out to about $6000 in debt per taxpayer. So glad to write him that check.

I long for the return of qualified technocrats. Retards humping doorknobs was funny for the first couple years of this administration, but it's fucking old now. Presidents are delegators because their presence is too valuable for mundane administration. They're not supposed to be their own fucking Press Secretary."
