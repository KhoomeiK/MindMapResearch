AMA,fpb5aab,t1_fpb4m6z,1588462402.0,"Bipolar disorder is basically you having extreme periods of depression, then extreme periods of energy (called mania) at times. So one week you can't get out of bed next week you have basically learned 30 new skills (this is an exaggeration but you get the point)

ASPD is sociopathy. Basically feeling a lack of empathy and emotions in general. So when you see people sad because someone died or lost a pet you don't really feel sad for them (or any different between what you feel under two very supposedly different circumstances like these). Being on the spectrum is different, however, because there are some specific things or people you feel this 'sadness' towards."

AMA,fpas5wg,t1_fparj74,1588454587.0,"Neither. I am sitting in my home right now.
I had to fight my way through everything. My mother was insanely disregardful, especially after I lost my father to suicide and she blamed me for it.
However, I live in India. So I saw a clear way out of it by the time I was 17.
Got a well paying online internship in a foreign country (USA. Understand that this is a huge thing in India), published my own book, aced basically every exam they could throw at me, and established myself at s power position it becomes impossible for anyone at my house to abuse. At this point I am viewed simply as some sort of weird genius, and it makes what I want easily achievable without them interfering. Although it can be really lonely, there's ways to work around things.
And rn all I want to focus on is help people in similar circumstances. Not out of empathy, but I believe people who have suffered mental illnesses are way more intelligent and efficient than neurotypicals."

Not trying to promote myself, but I am really glad to see a fellow writer who does this in midst of all the hysteria surrounding writing communities on Reddit."
