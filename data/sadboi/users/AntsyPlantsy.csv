AskReddit,eyy9oqq,t1_eywilqe,1567576652.0,"I just paid $100 for one lab manual and $60 for the other. Both created by professors on campus. I’m trying to figure out if it’s more important to eat the next few weeks or get text book which is $275. Our professor doesn’t teach in class, only does group activities during class periods and exams are 100% from the book. This is just for one class out of my 5. I seriously can’t balance working full time to make rent, pay for upfront college costs, and live and I’m panicking about this month. I took a year off to try to deal with mental health and thought I was getting better, but I don’t know how I’m going to get through this. But if I don’t graduate I’ll still have $60k in loans and no way to pay them back. So looks like I’m going to finish or die trying. But student loans don’t go away, and I can’t bear the thought of leaving my parents with that. I feel so trapped."

waterpolo,eu57yv0,t1_eu3mozm,1563471816.0,"A player should bring an athletic/academic/extracurricular resume. It should be between 1-3 pages depending on how much you have/how much you want to include. If you're doing three pages, the first should be athletic with some information about you. Height, handedness, what club team you're on and cap number for JOs, maybe even the times of your games on the first day since the schedule is out now. Swim times like the 50/100, or endurance are good to include. Also what high school team you play for and for how long you’ve been playing or how long you’ve been starting on varsity. Any awards like all league, all CIF, etc. are great to include. Your coaches contact info, your contact info including address.Academically: gpa, SAT, ACT, AP test scores. You can also include any extracurriculars, like music groups or clubs you have leadership position in. Maybe your intended major as well. basically what you do outside of the pool.

If you have a third page it should be a copy of your unofficial high school transcripts, especially if you are looking to go to an academically competitive institution. This can all be condensed or expanded upon as much as you want, but those are the things that we are looking for.

&#x200B;

edit: What coaches are allowed to do on the deck depends on what division they coach and how old the athlete is. For all coaches, we are not allowed to talk about recruiting at all until after your last game of the day, but we are allowed to say hi/introduce ourself/say good luck if a player comes over to us before the game. Now for the differences between the divisions.  

D1: At any time they can send non-recruiting material like questionnaires, school brochures, information on camps, etc. Or June 15th after Sophomore year they can call/text/email and send recruiting materials to athletes, but cannot communicate in person unless it is on the institutions campus. D1 coaches cannot have off-campus contact with athletes until after August 1st going into their Junior Year.  

D2: At any time they can send non-recruiting materials, but on June 15th after Sophomore year they can have electronic communication, on-campus contact, and off-campus contact. So, D2 does not need to wait until August to talk in person to athletes.   

D3: At any time they can send recruiting materials, have electronic communication through call/text/email. Can have on-campus contact at any time, can have off-campus contact after the athletes Sophomore year of high school."
waterpolo,eu2irpj,t1_eu1vw1y,1563391054.0,"Stats per season don’t really matter to us. It’s all kind of relative because high school teams vary so much in skill level. If you really wanted to do stats though, average per game is better than season stats. 
Swim times are nice. Like 50/100, or endurance.   
What team you play for and for how long you’ve been playing or how long you’ve been starting on varsity. Any awards like all league, all CIF, etc. are great to include. What hand you are. What tournaments you’ll be attending, your cap number at high school and at club. Your coaches contact info, your contact info.

waterpolo,eu2hz0r,t1_etz0inm,1563390540.0,"For some coaches it might. Some may only want kids from CA/international. I recommend looking at rosters of schools your interested in to see where their athletes are from. If they have a few from around the country, they’re probably more interested in a diverse team. If they only have CA/international players, they may not be interested in out of state players. Personally it doesn’t effect our interest. If an athlete is a hard working, coachable, dedicated team player, I’m going to be interested. And if they also stand out on an east coast team I’m really going to be interested."
waterpolo,eu2hiff,t1_eu1sww5,1563390248.0,"Summer their sophomore year is over they should be reaching out. Coaches can start electronically communicating then. And that’s how you get on their radar early. They probably won’t get a lot of love from coaches until after their Junior year high school season though.  
I like having my high school athletes have a list of 20 schools after sophomore year, 10 after junior year, and 5 at the start of senior fall semester."
waterpolo,eu2h70y,t1_etxw9qo,1563390049.0,"It really depends what we’re looking for. Realistically just about every kid on those high level teams are looking to play in college. So in that sense it’s easy to recruit at big games because they’re all interested in playing. However, a lot of them will be wanting to play at a big name D1 school, so I tend not to waste my time at those kind of games unless I’m already talking to/recruiting an athlete on the team. I tend to blindly recruit the middle of the pack teams, looking for the players who stand out there. Meaning if I’m just looking for who is good in the water to find more recruits I’ll go to those games. But most of the time I have an idea of who (which athletes) I’m going to go watch before I plan out which pools I’m going to in a tournament. For the big four schools this answer will be pretty different. They will for the most part recruit high level teams, some random players from out of California and international players. If you want someone to come to your game you have to reach out to them in advance."

waterpolo,etxhhvn,t1_etxgpxg,1563299452.0,"We sit on the pool deck, generally away from parents. Sometimes by the scoring table, sometimes on our own. But coaches will always have team gear on. So if you see someone with college gear, by themselves, generally with a notebook or something to take notes on, it’s usually a college coach. You can always go ask if they’re the coach from _____ college and introduce yourself. If not, no harm!"
waterpolo,etxfoub,t1_etx89iz,1563298347.0,"YES! I cannot emphasize enough that kids from outside of NorCal/SoCal need to put in a lot more work than kids from these hot zones. I myself am not from California and had a difficult time with the recruiting process.  

  

The recruiting forms are incredibly helpful, and provide so much valuable information for us as coaches. My institution has a low acceptance rate and rigorous academic standards, so including as much academic information as possible is great. Typically including a resume including the following will give us a holistic view of a player:  

\-GPA/AP-Honors classes & scores/SAT/ACT scores   

\-Extracurricular activities: music groups, volunteer work/hours   

\-Athletic info: swim times, handedness, position, awards/recognition/links to news articles if emailed

 As far as game film goes, we would rather see a full quarter of play than a montage of them shooting. We expect that they should be able to shoot if they want to play polo in college, I really want to know if they can get back to defense and be a team player/set up their teammates well also. 

Along with what you are currently recommending, I would also suggest they create profiles on NCSA/BeRecruited (I have no affiliation with these companies) but I do generally go to these websites a few times a year to look for kids who may not be on our radar. Not only that, but when a player emails me from a school/area I don't know I'll usually do a quick google search ""Player Name water polo"" to see if I can find anything on them, like an external recruiting profile, maybe some local news articles, or an all state/league nomination/award. Those are the things that tell me that this person is someone to be more serious about, because it's others who are recognizing them.  

&#x200B;

If your athletes are playing at tournaments where college coaches will be present, they should introduce themselves before the game and include their year/cap number so we can look for them/take notes during. Its unfortunate when a kid who is super interested in your school comes up to you after a game, and you weren't really watching them because you didn't know. After the game, have them go back and thank them. If its a tournament they most likely won't be able to talk about recruitment in person until after their last game of the day. Then the athlete should send a follow up email thanking the coach(es) that night for watching them, and give an update for their next games also."

AskTrollX,epc0daj,t3_bugbjy,1559148835.0,"I was on it for anxiety/depression. Worked well for the first few months, it actually allowed me to see what a semi-normal life would feel like. But then I began to lose all interest in everything, and had me contemplating suicide daily. Really pushed me into a deep depression, worse than I was feeling before. But it did seriously calm the anxiety. I guess if you don’t care about anything you’re not going to be anxious about it. I eventually quit (cold turkey—I would not recommend) and haven’t taken anything else since last August. Therapy has helped me more than anything."
