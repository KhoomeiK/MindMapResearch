OurPresident,fmgy541,t1_fmf5nmm,1586061031.0,"So a majority of the US healthcare bloat costs can be attributed to administrative costs, i.e. the private health insurance industry. By removing this aspect of the healthcare system, we would save money; [multiple studies have shown that M4all would save trillions of dollars over a decade, including a right-wing study](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/484301-22-studies-agree-medicare-for-all-saves-money)

There are tens of thousands of people who die every year due to being uninsured or underinsured. M4all would save roughly 68,000 lives per year as per the Lancet, one of the top respected medical journals, and they source where they draw their conclusions from 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33019-3/fulltext

In addition, it would improve the quality of life for many Americans who are uninsured or underinsured and can go see a doctor or a dentist for something that is bothering them. [A healthier workforce is more productive, as seen in this article published by Harvard that tracked companies with stronger healthcare plans typically perform better](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/ecpe/the-business-benefits-of-a-healthy-workforce/)

""the benefits of a healthy workforce show up elsewhere in a company’s data – in increased productivity, lower absenteeism, improvements in talent acquisition and retention, and other areas not directly reflected in health care costs.""

If we can increase the general healthcare and well-being of the US population, we would very likely also see a strong increase in workplace productivity across the US. 

So that's some numbers and studies, so let's tackle the issue of government regulation.

I would actually also consider myself a Libertarian, but moreso in this sense; the government should be instituted to operate in the best interests of the people, but stay the fuck out of their personal lives and decisions. One of the reasons I legitimately put Bloomberg on the same tier as Trump in my mind while he was in the running was due to regulating soda sizes all the way to implementing stop and frisk, along with other authoritarian policies. I don't think anyone in government should have that power over our decisions.

Right now, the concept of ""choice"" in our medical system is being lauded as one of the big reasons against M4all, where the general population would actually have more freedom and more choice under a single payer system, as they would no longer have to worry about monetary obligations when going to get treatment. A single payer system would allow everyone to have more decision making capacity when it comes to their own health. 

As a more personal example, aside from every other societal benefit that would come into play, I have bipolar 1. Without me having gone on medication 4 years ago, I probably would be dead right now due to the lifestyle that came with the unmedicated bipolar antics I was doing. I was lucky enough to have been born into a family where my dad has very good health insurance, and was able to get the treatment and medication I needed to be able to improve my life. Many people aren't so lucky. In fact, there are people on the bipolar subreddits that can't afford their medications, and they make posts about it... And then disappear for months, coming back with stories of how their lives get ruined by their depression and mania. With a single payer system, anyone with mental health issues could have access to the medication they need to be able to improve their lives.

And, as a very prevalent example due to our current pandemic, there are people already being shafted with bills due to having come down with Covid-19. While these bills may be mitigated later, we don't know how the government is going to handle that tbh, we can also look at people who may avoid going to get treatment due to fear of getting a medical bill, which then puts the rest of the population, including those with insurance, at further risk."
