I think its really sad to hear your friends just abandone you when someone else is showing up. These friends are not worth it, you dont need them in your life. I had to learn that some friendships are pretty much onesided and it seems like the same here. Dont feel bad not talking to them, they dont deserve it. It really rough to loose people who support you vut if they are not faithful with you, its useless. There are  poeple out there taht just want to bad mouth someone else. 

can you maybe go to antoher college? I was suffering from the people and teachers on my old school when I changed school a lot of things got better."

They are 2 match ups I always dodge but never ban because they are rare picks: Illaoi and Nasus. I think even Darius is more of a fair champion than them. Nasus needs a complete rework how is anyone enjoying this champ.

when teamfighting let your teammates kite him out, cc him from distance. 

great ways of this are lux q, fiddle q, leona ult etc. your job as camille is to quickly finish off people. so when darius is ccd you go for a q2. dont e on to him. 

remember camille is like a tanky assasin. you should rather flank with her and focus the adc."

It still haunts me and I visited  a psychiatric clinic.
One patient there told me:

Whenever I am around people I ask myself, do I wanna be alone? Or do I wanna hang out with these people?

And this really got me thinking. I was alone, but I didnt wanted to be with fake friends or stuck up people. So I broke up the contact with everyone that made me feel bad.

You should do the same. These people may be unfair to you. Ditch them. Do another hobby. Dont let people close to you that dont see you as a real friend.

When I reached 11th grade i switched school, and found very good friends. After six years I still have contact with them. Maybe switching your class or club might help."
