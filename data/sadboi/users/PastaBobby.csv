DnD,fqkkebc,t1_fqjphmu,1589429278.0,Thank you for the criticism! :)
DnD,fqauoma,t3_ghudah,1589225592.0,"Do the dwarfs know each other? Or are they from the same town? Then they could be miners or something like that and they discover something in the mines, which could be a portal or a magical trinket or something of that sort"
DnD,fqau8sg,t3_ghue28,1589225375.0,"I made this as my first longterm digital art project. The style is obviously inspired by darkest dungeon, which I played a lot during quarantine (not actual quarantine, but, whatever you know what I mean). This is the same dwarf paladin as before, although not quite as dark and brooding. He's right now returned from a quest where he had to play a diplomat to help some lizardfolk regain their territory... A quest which had gone painfully wrong (it's safe to say he isn't welcome there anymore). His party members were somehow all more succesful at convincing the other tribes to help the lizardfolk, at least that went well. Even if he got laughed at."
DnD,fi701np,t3_f6qhx5,1582211400.0,But what about mantaur paladin?
DnD,ffevsd6,t3_et1mgv,1579867635.0,"Ok but this is really cool! I love going to the attic with my dad, you never know what he's gonna bring out next!"
DnD,fdr2m4r,t1_fdqpltx,1578678687.0,Sounds interesting and yeah sure a lot of people enjoyed the piece and like the style so I'm not really sure I want to really change that much about the style
DnD,fdqj2vr,t1_fdq7iwv,1578667903.0,"I guess I can't really disagree with you, I'll just have to take your advise as it is. It seems you really made an effort to spot everything that went wrong and I can't argue with your points. I think it looks good though and am pretty proud of it, even if it has a lot of issues concerning how realistic everything is (or rather how unrealistic it is). Thanks for the advice in any case, I'll look to it that I'll make some more realistic details."
DnD,fdqimx1,t1_fdq2uhv,1578667595.0,Then I did it right it seems :)

DnD,fdoqmr1,t1_fdoptzz,1578610657.0,"Both are very nice for getting out of sticky situations, but personally I would go for misty step since it's a sure way to get 30ft away quickly and without the danger of opportunity attacks. This could also be used for a surprise attack. In summary I think misty step has more utilities."
DnD,fdopm21,t3_emhakq,1578610035.0,"Honestly, you're already good with eldritch blast but what really matters is that you get creative with your spells during combat/ solving puzzles."
DnD,fdooub0,t3_emh6e5,1578609570.0,"This is the first time I really took my time to flesh out a detailed character drawing with everything that is important to him. His name is Halgor the Angry. His name already suggests what he's like most of the time; and not only his enemies fear his righteous anger. His party members respect him even though he's by far the shortest of the bunch with only 130cm in height.
He's by far the character I had the most fun with while playing, I even did a grumpy, deep voice for him. And the intimidation checks were never easier. 
He's always got a bunch of javelins on his back as they are really practical for a guy with such short reach (and a movement speed of 25ft. ...)."
