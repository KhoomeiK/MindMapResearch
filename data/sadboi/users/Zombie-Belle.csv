Seems it must have been a credible tip as they had to go to a heap of trouble to hoist a man upside down, down into the well, which wasn't even in the same village/town she disappeared from or where the first set of remains/body parts were found?? This has to be a very important part of the whole case imo and I wish there was more information about this part of the ""search"" and how it came about????

Another thought - Geographical profiling might give some important leads in this case to pin down the likely radius of location of where the unknown suspect might live or work. I wish a geographic profiler could have run this case through their algorithm back then as it has known to be highly successful way of locating a known  radius of where an unsub lives or works but it seems it wasn't invented until about 1991 and expanded for LE (mainly US) use till 1999."
BDSMcommunity,fnoec86,t1_fno1ijv,1587122277.0,"Yes but if they stop the performance they would be worried about being 'blacklisted' as either a diva / not a team.player or not a good actress/actor or not being paid or a myriad of other things so i bet in most of these cases where the actress or actor has to keep performing these scenes they didn't realise would include violent acts or extreme bdsm or even things like humilation or multiple use or rape scenes, no protection or consent for parts or all of the acts etc happen way more than we realise (i know i have seen some 'after' scene talks with performers who seem very upset or angry or regretful or traumatised or shut down especially ones that seem exactly the opppsite in demeanour or enthusiasm in their beforehand talk  and yet they still have to (forced or pretending) say they ""enjoyed it"" even though its blatantly obvious that they must not really feel that way from their words, demenour or facial expressions or bodylanguage etc or not wanting to be after interviewed at all).


So they are not being blackmailed most times up front but i assume a lot of them need the money but are not told exactly what they are getting in to or allowed to safe word out or wont safe word out because of the reasons described above and so keep filming or go on to film more bdsm porn.


I also don't doubt a lot of these things happen to bdsm performers especially because it is assumed or demanded or coerced that they will put up with any thing because it's just ""expected"" of them if they are known to perform bdsm/film bdsm scences in the past.


For non-kink and/or bdsm unexperienced performers (on top of the issues raised above) it must be a lot of undue pressure and probably traumatic but as bdsm porn probably pays better or may make them more famous / give them more opportunities to work and these are added pressures that probably makes this porn even more exploitative imo especially if they dont know about negotiating limits and that safewords should be a thing!"

They have done studies that show opioid tolerance basically can just keep going up, it doesn't really plateu so it definitely depends on his tolerance levels as to whether that is a valid argument or not. Dont get me wrong i have severe doubts that the last 4 lines of the note were written by Kurt and find it odd how he would have pulled the trigger with his sneakers on. Also i have never seen the practice handwriting sheet and that is extremely incriminating in my opinion. Apparently there was also no legible fingerprints found on the gun, pen or the shotgun shell box either.
