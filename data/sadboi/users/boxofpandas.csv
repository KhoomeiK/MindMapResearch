CPTSD,f02q4xr,t3_d35sof,1568335827.0,"My mom told me not to tell anyone about what happens at home or else I'll be taken away from her. She was all I knew, so I kept my mouth shut when social workers came by.

That was dumb. Now I'm just extra alone."

domesticviolence,eybmrmj,t3_cwhm6i,1566987944.0,"Sounds like what I went through until he eventually threatened to kill me, and I believed him. Called the cops and left. 

I'm really sorry that happened to you. Not only is this domestic violence, but the psychological trauma is profound. I hope you get out and find help."
AskReddit,exsnm3l,t3_ctxfzk,1566550816.0,"The way we build houses is unsustainable and using up the Earth's resources faster than every other industry. The only way to make a sustainable home is to use rammed earth- the materials are local and those walls will last a thousand years. You won't have issues like mould or mildew, trees falling on your home won't crack them, and I'm willing to bet that it will stand an earthquake well enough too. Rebuilding homes made out of wood every 30 years is the biggest waste of material I have ever seen."

The magnet didn't release because the working cables snapped, which should be built into the safety attachments in the spring box."
yesyesyesyesno,exniybh,t1_exm24sc,1566457265.0,"I used to work for a travelling slingshot ride in Canada, and let me tell you, we do safety inspections every single time we put up the ride. Inspectors come to each province and look at the welds, and we legally cannot operate without the proper documentation completed. Every morning there is a safety done. 

HowEVER. This is NOT NECESSARY for amusement parks that stay PUT. Moving rides are always double and triple checked because we move them. Every single bolt and nut is investigated, deeper inspections of weld integrity and framework are thoroughly looked at. When a ride is stationary, there are daily, weekly, and monthly inspections. These are usually repeated by the same people, who eventually become lenient and complacent in their work ethic, thinking they know the ride better than everyone else. This is when things get brushed off. This is how accidents happen. Amusement parks don't have the same safety standards as moving rides, which undergo extreme scrutiny."
BPD,exad33g,t3_crthps,1566104917.0,"This is exactly what just happened to me. I went into the doctor's office and he said, ""You seem like you're doing really well, why don't we just continue as is?""

I have never felt so fucking invalidated. What's going on inside me will kill me one day."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewyq9z7,t1_ewv2dc1,1565885195.0,"I just want to point out that living with someone with a mental disorder is an abusive environment and you likely sustained years if emotional abuse.

There is no ""level"" of abuse that is worse than the other. They are all equal. Every abuse results in trauma. Trauma is what happens inside you during the abuse, and no one can measure that against another."
FriendshipAdvice,ewxgw2h,t1_ewt0kgy,1565856832.0,"Yeah, but it fades and I found a consistent answer to give people. I would joke that I was on a media cleanse or take it seriously and say I needed to spend more time with myself. I had an ex girlfriend call me once to check if I was still alive! Eventually people just get used to it and the ones who matter remember that you don't use it- so they find other means to contact you."
FriendshipAdvice,ewrkmwx,t3_cpo1sp,1565707705.0,"If you've thought about it this much, yeah, you probably should cut them out of your life. Every body deserves friends that build them up, treat them with kindness and respect. I recommend deleting social media and only keeping the people you want to hang out with in your phone, texting them on a regular basis. Your interactions will become more honest and genuine, it will improve the quality of your friendship.

When I started doing this, I lost a lot of my friends but in the end- the important ones that mattered stayed with me. I'm a lot happier with my support circle now. 

I even started to go as far as cutting out toxic people in my family, and it works like a treat. But that's for a more experienced person who is willing to face the guilt for that one."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewnsl0q,t3_cp2z98,1565588932.0,I deleted all my social media except reddit. I text very few people. I have two major trustworthy friends that I text and these are people I let into my life very carefully. Keep your circle tight. Be judicious in who you spend your time with. I promise you quitting social media will change your life.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,ewnrg4o,t3_cp3h5i,1565587653.0,"My brother did this when he was 5 and burned the entire house down, promptly after receiving a lecture from firemen coming to daycare to explain fire safety. Anyway, he hid behind his bedroom door while my Mom ran around the house frantically calling his name, but he was afraid he was in trouble. Finally, he stepped out and said, ""I'm sorry"" as she rushed him out of the house. When she opened the front door, all the windows exploded.

 If she hadn't gone back in for him, he'd have died in the fire too."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewai1fj,t3_cliuno,1565244119.0,"I developed BPD from watching my borderline mother attempt suicide repeatedly as a child. I always swore to myself I'd never grow up to be like her- then I tried to kill myself when I was 15 when my best friend ""broke up"" with me. I fell into a deep depression after that, having felt like I'd failed myself. 

 I vowed once more to not self-harm, but it didn't take long before something triggered me again and I'd be cutting my legs open instead of slicing my throat. I had to get sixteen stitches in my thigh once because I got so enraged with myself I wanted to tear my own skin off. By 22 I felt so defeated, overwhelmed and exhausted by the constant rollercoaster of love and hate- I decided to kill myself on my birthday. I hung myself and a brave stranger found me in the park and cut me down. I once again was forced to be alive and deal with my disorder.

I spent the next years in an abusive relationship that went up and down so often, I felt at home. After he strangled me and threatened my life, I ended up calling the cops- completely distraught that he didn't love me. An hour into my statement I was sobbing and begging for them not to arrest him because I loved him so much.

So, yeah, I absolutely wanted to give up at that point. I knew I couldn't kill myself because I'd be just like my Mom, but I dreamt of it often. After coming to terms that I had BPD- I suddenly realized I'm not alone. There are other people out there who get it. I may be crazy, but I'm not the only one!  Hell, even that didn't stop my suicidal ideation, but all I can say is it won't be like that every day. And even if ONE day isn't totally fucking shitty- it will be worth living. If you get that one amazing day where everything is starry and you are laughing with your family or friends, it is absolutely worth it to keep working. Why? Because you DESERVE it. You haven't been kicking your own ass your whole life just to roll over and die. You get to have your cake and eat it to. Why? Because you are a fucking CHAMP for coming this far. Normal people don't have the resilience you built up to keep maintaining. Does it suck? FUCK yes it does- and you will cry so hard some days. You know what the best part about crying is? You're letting yourself feel everything you've been holding back and it's YOUR BODY and you GET TO FUCKING CRY. It feels so good to empty yourself of all the pain you've endured. You deserve to feel those emotions and the joy of releasing them.  So, if there's one more good day coming (and there is) keep on trucking, my dude. You are a goddamn warrior and you do not get to just give up because you've worked your ass off to come this far! If you need to feel shitty and cry all day - you stay in bed for a fucking week if you have to goddamnit! BUT you get to keep living because you fucking DESERVE it. That kind of self talk will generate self love over time and just know it is not a linear path. You won't be happy every day. You don't have to be. That's the beauty of it babe."
BorderlinePDisorder,ewafhce,t3_cn3262,1565242617.0,"I experience psychotic rage when I'm really triggered and envision beheading people in the street. I often fantasize about strangling my Mom to death, but she's the only specific one and the source of all the abuse in my life. I'd like to say this is normal of BPD but I honestly don't know."
raisedbynarcissists,evca8en,t3_cj452d,1564410420.0,"Recently broke up with my Mom, pointing out her emotionally manipulative behaviour, mistakenly thinking she may see her actions and change.

Nope, I have members of the community asking me why I pissed her off so much, which just tells me she's throwing a typical tantrum when she doesn't get what she wants.

Sigh.

At least the block button works."
TalesFromYourServer,esmp676,t3_c88lbs,1562111045.0,"I once had a lady stare down the chefs (open kitchen) while they prepared their food, and at some point she called me over to just say, ""Are they... touching the food... with their hands?"" and I looked over and said, ""Well, yeah. They wash their hands all day long. It's like this in every single restaurant I've worked in."" I walked away and she looked shell-shocked. I broke that girl's brain.   


I also suffer from severe OCD about totally inane things (cleaning the shower every single day, wiping the taps, making the bed/remaking the bed). Some things are likely permanent for me, others I've changed in time. Working in restaurants has made me better about my food consumption, though."
