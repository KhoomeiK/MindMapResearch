childfree,fpordx5,t3_gef9h9,1588789351.0,"I feel exactly the same way. I am a doctor so whenever people hear I don't want kids I get the knowing looks of ""Aah, career lady, got it"" etc. But honestly I am a doctor purely because it pays the bills and funds my hobbies. If I could I would spend all day gardening, reading, skating and gaming, but nobody will pay me for that (and if I did do my hobbies for a living I doubt I would still enjoy them). So instead I work in a job that is difficult but well paid, that will allow me to live comfortably while working part time, and retire early. Remember, the fewer kids you have the earlier you retire. 
I think we all grow up being sold the idea of a dream job but that just isnt the case for the majority of people. Work is work. If it was fun they wouldn't have to pay you. Don't focus on a mythical job that won't feel like work, focus on enriching your life outside of work. No kids means you'll find it easier to go part time, take up hobbies, or holiday more!"

DesignMyRoom,fnn5qt4,t3_g2qkvp,1587084999.0,"Ditch the dresser and possibly the freestanding bookshelf as well. Your guests are unlikely to ever stay long enough to unpack their suitcase and put clothes in it. Plus there is a wardrobe and built in shelves so if they do want to unpack they have options. It's taking up space in what looks like a very small room that's 90% bed. 
Some colour and personality in the room would help a lot - paint if you can, or put some art on the wall and get a bedspread to match. Put some books or games on the build in shelves so they aren't just bare, and so your guests have something to read or do.

It's hard to tell but it looks like the bed is currently in the corner, move it into the middle of the wall if you can so couples dont have to climb over each other to get in and out."
childfree,fnn08ai,t3_g2it7q,1587081668.0,"One of the only times I used to picture myself with kids was when I was thinking ""when I have kids I'll raise them bilingual"", or ""when I have kids I'll enroll them in sports and not let them quit"". And it stemmed from the fact that deep down I believed myself to be unexceptional/ uninteresting. 

I am very prone to perfectionist, black and white thinking, but have lacked the motivation and drive to actually work hard enough to achieve the results I want. So for a while I fell into the thought pattern of ""well it's too late for me, I'm a failure, but my kid won't be"". Which is just a TERRIBLE reason to have a child but it is so common. Some people feel they have not achieved what they wanted, but if they have a child, the child's achievements are due to them so they feel good again. And that isnt necessarily bad for the child but it is not what I want for my life.

 Recognizing this has really helped me to try and focus on what I want to achieve and start working towards it again. And spending time on my hobbies has in turn reconfirmed that the last thing I want is a child to take me away from them."
BodyPositive,fngkahu,t3_g19ho1,1586934956.0,"For me what made the difference was letting go of ""exercise"", and instead embracing sport. Instead of the unconscious focus being weight loss or muscle gain, make the focus fun, teamwork or just seeing how far you can get in mastering a skill. There may not be team sports at the moment but you can use this time to think about what you may like to do. 
I chose artistic rollerskating because I'm not a team sport person but there are many many sports out there. 
Dance, soccer, athletics, hockey, basketball, tumbling, swimming, diving, heck even muggle Quidditch. Find something you've always wanted to try and give it your best shot. Even if you get to a point later where you feel ready to do straight exercise, use your sporting performance to motivate you rather than changing your body."

garden,fmrx96s,t1_fmrdypk,1586338858.0,"I made a 3 sided wooden U shape that essentially straddles the fence, the garden is screwed, glued and tied onto the front wooden panel so that it all hangs over the fence. Some plastic lattice supports the bottom half of the garden as it leaves the fence and drapes into the pond. I anticipate in a few years the materials will start to degrade and it may need some repair but so far no issues. 
The garden itself is made from a layer of pond liner, then 2 layers of vertical garden felt. I cut horizontal slits in the top layer of felt to form pockets I can plant into. The pond liner prevents it losing water from the back and forces all the water to flow back down into the pond. 
There is tubing embedded between the 2 felt layers running from the pond, up to the top, across and back down into the pond again. The pond pump is attached to this tubing, forcing water up to the top of the garden where it comes down through drippers and holes cut in the pipe. The remaining water comes back down and drains into the pond again.

hermitcrabs,fi0ltb7,t1_fi00dg3,1582039883.0,"Sure! essentially it's a 4x2x2.5 foot tank, divided into 3 sections. I bought the tank, stand and lid secondhand and siliconed the dividers in myself. On the left is a divider forming a saltwater tank which reaches almost to the top of the tank. This is connected to a 120litre sump tank to make 220litres total volume in the saltwater tank. The sump contains a protein skimmer, an auto top off unit, my filtration material, a chaeto refugium and a heater. There are a few easy corals, some shrimp, a sea urchin and 2 clownfish in that tank. The crabs go in and out via some mesh on the divider wall. 

The terrestrial section has deep sand/coir substrate mixed 8:1 (my crabs are Aussies) with some plants in pots as not to interfere with tunnels or moult space. Thriving colony of isopods and my 2 crabs - I'd love more but I refuse to fund the crab industry so I'll wait for rescues to come up. 
The freshwater section is approx 1 foot deep, with driftwood in and out of the water, with java moss, tillandsia and other epiphytic plants attached to the wood. There are aquatic plants in the water. There is a small submerged pump in the freshwater section, and the output is into tubing that runs up the back wall of the tank and trickles down into a plant wall - still finding out what will happily live in that bit but I have some vertical garden felt with pockets in it, and plants in those pockets which are watered by the waterfall. Living in the freshwater tank are a breeding population of cherry shrimp and many snails. 

No issues with floods so far, I have a false bottom and check it regularly. Temp and humidity are stable, just one small heat mat on the back currently - having the large volumes of tropical water keeps the humidity and temp really good. There are 2 LEDs - one plant spectrum and one coral spectrum. I did have a UVB light but disconnected it as it was sitting very close to my wooden lid and I was concerned the heat may be a fire risk. If I can find a lower profile one I'll put one in again. 

Only pest issue so far has been a few gnats, trying to bait them with apple cider vinegar and feeding dry foods which seems to be helping. 

I monitor the parameters in the salt and freshwater tanks closely and no ammonia or instability even when the crabs poo or drop food in the tank - the water volume is huge and the plants/chaeto help keep nutrients low. Currently I'm doing 1/3 water changes every 2-3 weeks but this is mainly out of caution, parameters have been very stable. I haven't seen the crabs bother any of the livestock or vise versa. 

The tank has been set up for about 3 or 4 months now. It cost me easily a $1000 once you factor in the sand, plants, glass cutting, tanks, coral and equipment. My lounge room was covered in sand and equipment for a long time during the build. 

Was it worth it? Yes. I love my tank and theres always something to watch even when I have pet sand. I'll continue to add to the coral reef, no other livestock are planned. Its not something I'd recommend unless you're experienced in fish keeping and water testing but I have loved it. It's amazing to see how frequently the crabs fully submerge - my big crab goes under all the time, my smaller crab I've only seen fully submerge once but he's more active at night and has been moulting for the last few weeks."

hermitcrabs,ffwis97,t3_evhnqy,1580302406.0,"I have a planted tank. It is hard but has been fun and worth it. 
Things to consider - you will need to plant in some kind of container as otherwise the roots can disturb moults, I use coconut coir pots in the sub, and plastic pots above the sub. Try to keep as much as possible off the sub as it limits moulting space. You need to have plenty of room to moult as otherwise they might feel the need to moult above the surface or in the potting mix. For the same reason consider adding something on top of your plant soil to discourage them to moult or dig in it. Choosing plants that will thrive as epiphytes (attached to driftwood or vertically on a wall) gets around this issue and looks great. 
Consider what you plant in as soil can introduce pests like worms or other pests you dont want in a tank. 
Invest in good lighting 
Lastly try and pick plants that will survive the crabs and the humidity- mine dont damage the plants but it's hard to predict, assume they will be chewed on and climbed on and pulled down."
