I'm glad I had the foresight to get an external hard drive to transfer all my games before my other console kicked the bucket.  It'd been giving me problems for awhile, sticking to the green screen for upwards of half an hour before restarting itself and repeating it over and over again."
xboxinsiders,fgoa156,t1_fgk0atj,1580963561.0,"Before opening it up I contacted them and they said they don't repair XBox One anymore because the model is no longer made.  They instead told me to get it opened up and remove the disc either by a professional or myself.  Seeing as the console stopped working after it made the ugly grinding noises, there's no reason to not just tear it apart.  As for the disc, it was torn apart by the console.  Looks like a cat got to it and scratched it all up.  Thankfully Diablo 3 went on sale shortly after I made the original post."
xboxinsiders,fgjqn3k,t3_ewtcxc,1580849483.0," My  XBox One ate my Diablo 3 disc and then stopped working. The whole  console just shut down. Seeing as I planned on replacing my console, I  went ahead and got an XBox One X because my other console is no longer  being serviced due to being an old model.

But  the game is still stuck.  So I went to Best Buy and they did everything  they could to remove it, but it isn't budging.  It made  ""pop"" sound  like it was about to come out, but then it didn't.

So  I contacted XBox Help to see about getting a digital copy considering  my physical one is no longer available.  Nope!  I'll have to pay full  price for the digital copy, which is $59.99.  I already paid for the  game, as well as for all the DLCs (I know I don't need to buy the DLCs  again).  There's nothing they can do to replace the copy, which is  really frustrating.

I honestly  don't understand why, if a consumer owns a physical copy and it's on  their account, a digital copy can't be provided for free or at massive  discount.  I already have the game, but it's unavailable due to my old  console no longer willing to give it up.

Is  there any way we can, in the future, have digital copies provided to  us?  Digital licenses we won't have to pay for because we already have  the game?  This will prevent so many issues in the future!

Right  now I'm about to just take a hammer to the old console because the  screws that are on the inside are stripped on top and my screwdriver  (regardless of size) can't get a grip on it.

Edit: This was moved from it's previous location on this subreddit to this one as required (I misread the rules).

Edit: About an hour after making the original post, Diablo 3 was on sale in the digital store for less than $20, so I bought it."

Reactions range from a sneer and rolling of the eyes to ""you don't look disabled"" and then outright hostility. One server refused to give me one due to some bullshit policy they came up with on the spot; as soon as I tried to drink from the glass of water there was a mess involving me dropping the glass.  I have tremors in my hands, and even holding that thing with both of my hands wasn't enough to prevent the mess.  The server got even ruder when they started to clean it up, calling me lazy.  We demanded to speak to the manager at this point because I refuse to be treated this way.  There was never a straw policy, that server had been giving everyone who asked for one the very same treatment, and I received a straw and a different server.

Metal straws aren't adjustable.  Sure, there are some with a bend in them, but it can't be adjusted.  Those things are an injury that's waiting to happen, and several people have been injured by them.  Myself included.

She and her office did all the work, helped me find resources to help me while we went through the process.  It was 2.5 years later that we were in front of a judge, and said judge was appalled I was denied in the first place.  

My lawyer informed me that disability cases are approved over 90% of the time if the person applying has a lawyer to help.  Otherwise they're denied immediately after applying the first time.  

SSI will only allow you to have $2k at any given point.  If you have a car, property of any kind, that's considered a form of income and source of funds.  If you're even a penny over the amount they permit you to have, you will be investigated for fraud, funds will be frozen, and you may even have to pay them back.

I had only worked a few years, was denied because I hadn't worked enough (the typical excuse), was never in the military (the military doesn't accept anyone with epilepsy), and told me to basically fuck off.  The lawyer saved me a lot of work, a lot of stress, and also saved my life.

Didn't believe anyone would love me, and now I'm happily married (14 years next June).  I have two cats that purr when they look at me, both insist on sleeping as close to me as possible, and one of them detects my seizures and help bring me out of them.  Didn't think I would ever be free of panic attacks, but now I'm nearly 6 months free (been having them daily since I was 15).  Didn't think I'd ever figure out why I was horrible in so many things, and this June I was diagnosed with ADHD.  The diagnosis has resulted in a change of treatment and wow...so much makes sense.  Since being declared disabled when I was 25, I didn't think I'd ever know success other than succeeding at failure.  I now make quilts and jewelry, as well as paint.  

On my darker days I remind myself if I end it now I'll never get to play the next Dragon Age game, see the coast again, eat fresh watermelon, enjoy home cooking, or play in the snow.

My husband and I had a similar issue with a landlord.  During the hottest summer on record for that area, the a/c broke down.  It's humid af as well, the house has a lot of windows, and most of them were painted shut.  We gave a our 30 day notice, cleaned the hell outta the place, going so far as to rent a Rug Doctor (shampoos the carpet).  They refused to give us our security deposit because they need the money to fix the a/c we broke because we ran it all day.  Um...what?  It's central air, not a window unit, and those things are designed to run all day.  We had the thermostat set at 75 F to save money, but when the a/c broke down the upstairs (where the bedrooms are) got to over 100 F.  

On top of that, the gas had been shut off that previous winter.  The landlord had come over to inspect the place, and informed us the furnace was too dangerous to operate anymore.  Seeing as we didn't keep anything in the basement (when it rained, it poured, and when it poured the basement flooded) he locked the door.  We had no idea what tf was going on, but he told us to get some space heaters and to balance the cost, he took $50 off our rent that month.  

Seeing as we're never getting the money back, we turned to revenge.  The landlord was gonna be outta town the week we moved out (4th of July shit).  My husband worked at a restaurant that used a lot of fish, resulting in the ""undesirable"" parts getting tossed in the trash.  As soon as we finished loading the moving truck, we went to work putting those parts deep in the vents, shoving them back with a broomstick.  We also tucked them in various other spots that would be difficult to find.  

A couple weeks later the house was condemned.  A combination of ""unidentifiable odor"" as well as the house twisting on a collapsing foundation and the landlord refusing to fix the foundation.  I think what happened is the landlord brought in a pro to figure out the odor issue, went in the basement, the pro saw the condition it was in, and reported it to the city.  The house was demolished at the landlord's cost."
