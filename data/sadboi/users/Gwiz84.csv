Try to free yourself from the pressure you are putting on yourself, sit down, relax. And ask yourself. What do I like?

Try to take things down a notch and realize that you are only 14, you are still very young, you don't need to put a lot of pressure on yourself. You can just take things slowly, one step at a time, try out some different things. And be completely relaxed about it all, you have plenty of time."

When I play a game for the sake of nostalgia, I usually play for 30 minutes tops and then I have my fill. But I don't replay Baldurs Gate 1+2 for countless hours 20 years later because of nostalgia, I do it because they haven't made a game that came close to it or is anywhere near as epic as it was and still is today.

Same goes for other types of media from the 80's 90's, it's not just nostalgia. Fx I still rewatch TNG quite often, and it has nothing to do with nostalgia. They just don't make tv shows like that anymore, with that type of episodic format. There is a concrete difference between how they make shit nowadays, compared to other time periods. Just take a look at the newest trek shows (picard and discovery), they are made in that hollywood non episodic style, where one storyline spans the entire season instead. Maybe some of us just love the old format that they have now decided is outdated? And that's why we go back and rewatch the old stuff.

So writing it off as just ""nostalgia"" seems kinda weak to me, there are very concrete differences between how they made games, movies and tv shows in earlier time periods. Formats that are lost now, which many of us still appreciate."
