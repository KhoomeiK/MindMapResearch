>There is no correlation between skin tone and behaviour. There is however correlation between poverty and such behaviour. Broken communities and such behaviour. Many other factors that come into play, none of which denote to skin tone.

This is irrelevant to the topic. And you may be wrong either way. If black people make up a disproportionate amount of these impoverished people from broken communities, and those types of people commit more violent crimes, then there is in-fact a correlation between their race and violence. Correlation =/= causation.

>My comment was specific to it being racist and it 100% is. In regards to racism being bad? Open an American history book and take a look yourself. You should find your answer. Or look to Germany’s history, same thing. Or let’s take it to Africa and look at Rwanda’s history. Then you’ll see if racism is bad or not. Not satisfied? Take a gander at India’s history or even China/Japan’s history. Racism leads to one thing. Every. Single. Time.

Well you just said that it's neither bad or good, so it sounds like you're contradicting yourself. And we're not talking about genocidal regimes or Jim Crow laws. This is about how a private citizen may react to being attacked by violent black kids of a culture that glorifies being a literal thug. Is it bad for her to avoid that type of person from then on? I'd say not at all. It wouldn't make as much sense for her to avoid a middle-class black man that doesn't dress/act like that, but even in that case it'd be normal human behavior to associate people who look like her attackers with violence.

Are you saying that a bad experience with a human would make her avoid all humans? Maybe if she's colorblind. It works with dogs as it doesn't really matter what breed a dog is because they can all do damage if they're big enough. In our society we tend to separate people into 'races', and she will likely associate young black people like them with being violently kicked in the face, because it's not likely for a middle-class businessman to be that sort of threat, for example. And avoiding every stranger is only possible if you're a recluse.

>No matter which way you slice, if you take the actions of one and place them on the shoulders of everyone from a similar race, I don’t give a fuck what the incident was, it is, without a single shadow of a doubt absolutely racist. Simple.

And being racist is always bad right? So this woman hypothetically avoiding people who look like her attackers is a bad thing? I'd say it's a very reasonable thing to do. In her world, (young)black people of a certain culture have been unpredictable and violently attacked her for no reason, therefore she should avoid them. This may be a surprise to you but not everyone is an omniscient being that sees the world in a completely objective and perfectly logical way.

>I’ll give you an example that fits your racist logic so you can see how utterly stupid it is. White kid walks into a school and shoots up the place. Now, that school will always doubt every white kid that walks in there? Huh? Total egghead thinking.

Well I'd say that your example is less fitting than mine. A school is not a sentient being, however the school administrators, staff, and students are. And it would make perfect sense for those people to be wary of suspicious students that walk in the door after having one of them commit a massacre there. That is how humans work. If certain white kids are more likely to do that sort of thing then they'd focus more on that type of person. Naturally. But a school cannot legally ban all white people from entering the building, whereas a private citizen can choose to avoid people of a particular race if they want to.

> Sure you can do it, sure you can claim it’s rational and logical but it doesn’t change the fact that it’s racist.

I feel like you're using the words 'racist/racism' like it's supposed to be shocking, but I don't see it as that horrible in this particular scenario. You might think that a violent-assault victim specifically avoiding young black thugs like the ones in this video is racist, or that a woman who's been raped avoiding large men outside at night-time is sexist, but I would disagree that either of them are bad people because of it. It's perfectly normal human behavior, and rational from the perspective of that person with their life experience."
