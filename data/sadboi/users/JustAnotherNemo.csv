internetparents,fqypij0,t3_glhtck,1589752415.0,"Welcome to this family!! :)

I have been in your exact position. Me and my partner (both men) became engaged and couldn’t really tell anyone but our friends about it. 

We eventually told family, which was met with pretty sad results. My mom told me I was an idiot and demanded I take my ring off. I didn’t. She mocked my partner and I and said it would never be a “real marriage”. 

We still haven’t married in a ceremony, mainly because we want to figure out if there is a way to bring family around to the idea (my partner’s family, not mine lol). We’ve been living together for about eight years now, so it’s not like it’s really a surprise at this point anymore but... family is complicated. 

At this point, I think we’re both done waiting on family to come around to it. We are in love and want to spend our lives together. 

Wishing for their acceptance and love will always be painful, but it’s much more painful to neglect the acceptance and love you have for yourself and your fiancé. You will be stronger for it. 

Your family will have to figure out if they value you and your fiancé as people in their lives, and make their own decisions. Leave that to them. 

You do you! Wishing you a very happy, healthy engagement and a lovely marriage filled with lots of wonderful things. :)"
fountainpens,fqyjvds,t3_glna3g,1589749768.0,"I caved and picked up another Moonman off Amazon. I’ve been curious about pocket pens, but didn’t want to break the bank on something I felt fearful that I would eventually break or lose in the shuffle of everyday life. 

I picked up the Moonman Wancai in Bitter Green and hoped I would not get attached. 

But it happened immediately. I am smitten. 

Tiny, but powerful writer in a surprisingly ergonomic form. When posted, it feels a lot like writing with my Moonman C1, although not nearly as weighty, which is a bit of a welcome trait to me, as I experience hand fatigue very easily and I don’t need something hefty for an EDC pen anyway. 

It’s fun, zippy, and has a very tight, stiff nib that writes wet, but with a little scratch. Writes extra fine compared to the Moonman C1, reducing bleed and showing off the TWSBI Orange’s fire ember high and low lights with ease. (I wish I could photo the TWSBI Orange decently. It’s the most surprising of all the TWSBI inks I’ve tried. Truly dynamic and uncannily embers in pen ink form.)

Anyway this little pen gets my endorsement. It’s not as cheap as it used to be, but comes packed with six black ink cartridges and standard Moonman glass eye dropper so I feel that it is more than a little glamorous for the cheap-o price tag. I picked mine up from Amazon for $20."

fountainpens,fqbcs8y,t3_ghxgl7,1589234619.0,"Decided to give this pen a shot after seeing so much hype about it. I loaded it with TWSBI Pink, an ink I haven’t tried before, and started breaking it in. It initially wrote very dry and I was very disappointed, but after rinsing out the feed and realigning it with the nib I had much better results. I switched to TWSBI Royal Purple halfway through writing and had 100% better results (it was very wet and glided easily), so I think the pink ink might be a little too saturated for the feed of the C1. Ended up switching back to pink to test and, sure enough, it was a dry write again. Interesting results. Overall I really like the weight and feel of the pen. I could see it being an EDC if it had a clip and the cap could post— the two biggest set backs to this pen, in my opinion. Still, it makes a great drawing and desk companion. The flat edge that prevents it from rolling away is a nice touch and the aesthetics are pleasing. Surprised by how sturdy it is overall. It seems like it could take a beating. Has anyone else tried this pen? What did you think?"

infj,foymgyx,t3_ga6ipm,1588175168.0,"The biggest thing I learned from this is that I am capable of calmly and confidently dissolving plans. Before the virus, I was saving up to buy my first home. I gave up almost every comfort to fill my savings account each month. I was getting closer and closer every day. My timeline to buy went from 6 months to 2 months...

And then this all happened. Timeline for home buying turned back into an infinite, unseeable amount of time. My savings disappeared to feed my bills. And that's all there is to that. 

I may not even have a job to come back to when this is over with. My perfect-for-me, extremely niche, hey-i'm-using-my-degree-afterall job. In fact, my entire field might disappear for the next several years. 

And I just feel okay about the whole thing. Because I have to be. Because there is no other way to be. I did what I could and now I have to do what I can.

There's even some comfort in that. 

As disappointed as I was, I have really learned to just let it go. No amount of planning and budgeting and working could have prevented this. Dreams, sometimes, only manifest in the mind.

Aside from that--

I was worried I would get bored during my time away from work and friends, but I've had the complete opposite experience. I spend my days making things, writing, cooking, sculpting, taking care of my plants and animals... Throw in a little video games here and a phone call to people I love there. Life ain't so bad. 

I also learned that I *do* like audio books after all, and that's been exciting! Now I can sculpt freely for 12+ hours to the desert sounds of Dune while happily disappearing into mental static and come out the other side a father of some weirdo creation.

There's some heavy speculation about lifespan for these guys. I see anything from 8 years to 20 years, but I have also seen 17 years referenced and sited heavily. The truth is I don't exactly know. 

I think a big part of the mystery has to do with the fact that they are not yet being bred and raised in captivity on the same controlled scale as other beetles. This has less to do with eggs not being laid and more to do with getting eggs to successfully hatch and getting larvae to successfully metamorphose. A zoo managed to breed and raise them after attempting many times, but they aren't positive about their method.

Generally beetles are not very picky at all. In the past I have been less selective feeding my beetles special diets because most adult beetles don't live beyond a few months. 

Blue Death Feigning Beetles can live to be 17 years old or so, so I am trying to be careful with them and give them foods that are more suitable for them. Their staple diet is fresh fruit and vegetables with cat and dog food to supplement for protein. If my feeder insects die I pass them onto the beetles and they clean them up really quickly.

Wishing you lots of happiness and health, my friend!"
FTMMen,fmp5vew,t3_fwlvuo,1586275009.0,"It can be so hard to navigate intimacy and sex sometimes. Being trans and dealing with dysphoria amplifies many of the anxieties and fears that many people already have about sex. I'm so sorry you are so upset and frustrated. This should feel like an exciting moment for you, but instead it seems like you have a lot of worries and disappointment. I'm sorry for that. 

If I can pass on some gentle words of encouragement, that by no means can cure the pain but might lessen it a little: 

Sex is sex. No matter what way you have it. It's about people and connections and actions and intimacy and so many different kinds of things depending on the person and their needs or desires. If you end up playing with toys, that's great! They can be fun for sure! If you end up playing with just yourselves and what your bodies have to offer in terms of pleasure and comfort, that can be equally wonderful too. Don't discount what you and your body can do to experience something positive in whatever way makes you feel happy. 

Sex should be about what you are 100% comfortable with. If you feel like having a specific prosthetic is part of that percentage towards 100% comfort, hold off and renegotiate what kind of sex you are 100% comfortable with. Touching, kissing, cuddling, oral sex, digital penetration, mutual masturbation, grinding, and all the other endless and creative options for intimacy are before you and can serve you very well! These are still sex, even without the affirming kind of sex you seek.

If you have another kind of prosthetic you'd like to play with that isn't pack-and-play, you can always make that part of the sex too. Wearing the strap on holster under clothes can make for a quick and seamless transition later. Depending on the flexibility of your toy, it can be put in the strap on and tucked under clothes-- although you will seem hard and ready (is that a bad thing?) for the moment. If neither of these are options, you can always make adding the strap on and toy part of the show if you would feel confident doing that or you can blindfold your partner for a bit of sensation play and anticipation while you get ready.

Always be open and honest with your partner about what kind of experiences you want to have and plan a bit together to ensure you are both on the same page. 

In the meantime, consider what kind of toys you are interested in adding to your collection (or which ones will start a collection if you are new to toys) and take your time picking out the toys you need!

And don't forget the lube! (And protection if wanted!)

Good luck and feel free to message if you have any questions. I used to work in the adult sexual health world many years ago and feel like I have help to offer others from time to time."

ballpython,fmd82dj,t1_fmcmize,1585961434.0,"Oh dang! Thanks for your reply.

I can't be totally sure about her age. I picked her because she was the smallest little snake they had and I just kind of tend to go for the runty animals. She was so chill and had beautiful markings. I realized later she might have been starving or stunted and worried she wouldn't eat for me, but she eats just fine. Hoping she puts on lots of weight and grows up healthy!"
ballpython,fmcbycw,t1_fmcbj3j,1585942752.0,"Oh weird. I am using the terms from the seller of the mice and a feeding chart I found. The seller distinguishes the mice as hoppers, then weanlings (they claim they are newly weaned mice), and then adult mice. Sorry for the confusion!

I will do the double prey thing. Thank you so much for all the advice and wisdom. I want to give this snake a good life."
ballpython,fmcay49,t1_fmca5ya,1585942206.0,"The weanling mice I have are about 12g (skinniest little ones) to 18g (fat plump ones). These aren't hoppers.

I was planning to do the mouse scenting thing, but I didn't know about feeding a mouse and then a rat. I was planning to scent the rats and offer the mice if she refused the rats. Thank you for the advice. 

I do have a question about feeding. So far she's a very shy eater. I have never had a snake that wouldn't bite or strike, but she literally won't eat until I leave the room or dim the lights. And when she eats she doesn't strike or coil or anything. She just kinda... Inhales. She's pretty timid. When offering the mouse she doesn't seem very interested, doesn't flick her tongue like my others, etc. She eventually finds it and eats. If I am offering a mouse and then a rat, given that she's a shy eater, should I offer them both at the same time or offer the mouse, wait, and then offer the rat?"
ballpython,fmc9hmb,t1_fmc8wk2,1585941421.0,"Unfortunately the breeder hasn't been available since COVID-19 stuff really started kicking off. I followed up with him after purchase and he hasn't been responsive. Hoping he will follow up.

According to the feeding chart posted in this sub, it looks like she can eat weanlings for a little longer-- do you think I should try to transition her to rat fuzzies or should I keep feeding into adult mice?

Thanks for the information. Your posts (especially your infamous stuck shed posts) are always helpful. Thanks for being active on this sub!"
ballpython,fmc8me5,t1_fmc758q,1585940952.0,"Thank you for the advice! I am planning to feed her the biggest weanlings and move her onto adult mice as soon as I can.

The seller (selling on behalf of a breeder) said she was born ""late in the season"" and that the breeder ""lets his snakes breed late"" which initially made me estimate maybe her being hatched in November. But when I checked the breeders Facebook images I could only find baby photos from July and August at the latest. I can't be sure but one of the hatchlings appeared to match her markings in a photo from July 24th, which made me assume she's about 8-ish months. What age do you estimate a snake her size being? 

She's not very long yet. I'd estimate like a foot and a half, if that."
ballpython,fmc6kpj,t3_fudzm9,1585939853.0,"After anxiously waiting a month to make sure she was consistently eating each week, exhibiting good health, and getting accustomed to handling, I finally moved my new baby Zhora from her little tub to her new home today. She seemed pretty unsure at first (pictured here), but she's exploring a bunch now. 

I also weighed her today. When we got her she was quite skinny at 93g and as of today she is thick and chonky at 128g! Does anyone know whether a weight gain like that is normal? It seems pretty significant to me. She eats a smallish weanling mouse every Monday. I'm unsure about her age, but I am anticipating that she is about 8 months. I think she seems kind of small for her age, but I can't be sure. What do you fine folks think?"
NOLA,fmc5ivb,t1_fmbukk9,1585939293.0,"I'm sure there's many different kinds backed by many different beliefs. Haven't heard of the coffee cans thing but that's interesting!

In old European and early American witch bottles, the common belief was that if a spirit or a witch (or whatever perceived threat) was coming after someone it would sense the bottle as its target instead (hence the creators of the bottle hiding their own urine, fingernails, etc in them) and get confused, unable to find the human target."

Wishing you and the team lots of happiness and wellness! Thanks for wowing the world with your performances and giving us lots of wonderful stories and moments to absorb during this weird and uncertain time.

And thanks for personally making my day!"

I think that's the big draw to puppetry for me-- you can become any character you need to be to make a story or scene happen. It's like magic. I started in animation and illustration, and slowly I'm moving more and more into puppets. No website published yet, but working on one. I'm in the process of independently creating a short puppet/stop-motion film in my kitchen (at least there is something to do during shelter-in-place times, ha ha), apprenticing at a puppet theatre in my city where I get to restore the vintage marionettes of Tom Tischenor (a local puppet legend), and I do short performances and appearances at festivals around town. I really wish I had some work to share with you, but I'm truly just a novice experimenting, learning, and being inspired by great folks that came before me!

I really love the flexibility and humility you spoke of. I think those are real winning characteristics to have when it comes to film and performance of many kinds-- the willingness to be collaborative, to hand the reigns to your partners and trust them, and to do what needs to be done to support the bigger picture is so inspiring and wonderful. These seem like they are big elements of live performance puppet theatre too from what I've observed. Some singular puppets have many different puppeteers and teams behind them.

I'm not sure if you are interested in answering more questions, but if you are:

Do you have a live performance background with puppetry or acting, or have you done exclusively film and TV work? Have you always done work that mixes human actors and puppets together? What's that chemistry like?

Do you still work to ""find"" Ennui in your prep for performance, or would you say he is more ""under the skin"" now? How's your French now? Ha ha

It sounds like it's really amazing to be on set with everyone! How many puppeteers are there? Is there a good place to see BTS of Kidding? (Is there a ""making of"" documentary in the works?)

Thanks again for answering! Have a great day!"
Kidding,fm8u44e,t3_fts9ej,1585856059.0,"Hi there! I love the show and the incredible puppets and sets. I'm an aspiring puppet designer (starting to get more into operating and puppeteering too), and the show is huge source of inspiration to me. 

How many puppets are you responsible for puppeteering? 

Who are your favorite puppets to work with and why?"

bioactive,fm5t3jb,t1_fm59d3f,1585779411.0,"To be really honest I didn’t measure anything. I mixed everything together until it was the consistency I wanted. Whatever you do, I would say go easy on the sand— sand holds moisture surprisingly well once wet. This mixture is definitely more soil heavy with sand as a mix in, if that helps."
