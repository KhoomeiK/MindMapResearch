He had a hard time breathing and could not sleep or eat. He had to stay in one room until he got better. 

He is fine now. We were PUMs after he left but never had to be tested because we were asymptomatic. We just had to stay home four fourteen days. His wife, who was also tested because they live together, never got it.

When we found out he had it, my first reaction was anger to be honest with you. They should not have flown here if he was not feeling well. They should not have explored Manila, possibly spreading the virus to other people."
