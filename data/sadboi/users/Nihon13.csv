calculus,f95ttxr,t3_e32h1i,1575135240.0,"Just use a simple substitution u = y\^2 - 3

then after you integrate in relation to 'u' and return to 'y' you will get :1/

3\* (y\^2-3)\^3/2 ."
calculus,f95s9zz,t3_e3w03w,1575134363.0,"That's equal  = lim n to  infinity 16\^(1 / 2\*n) + 2\^(2\*n / 2\*n)

(1 / 2\*n) goes to zero and (2\*n / 2\*n) equals 1 , so we have  16\^0 + 2 = 3"
depression,f69tvde,t3_cqqe91,1572747335.0,"Same situation here...

 Anxiety and depression made it impossible to me to study, and so I failed in a lot classes(most of them I just stopped going to the classes).The feeling of being 'caged' in this situation made me think about suicide a lot of times.

But in this semester I improved a lot , and now I'm more hopeful about my future.

Hope you get well to!!

Good Luck!!"
