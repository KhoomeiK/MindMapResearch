But anyways, I've had all of my computer's randomly wake up even when I told it not to. Windows just doesn't abide by sleep policy rules very well. Honestly I wouldn't worry too much about it. But if you're still concerned just take it offline and see if it continues to act weird."

depression,f069r9i,t3_d3mqe2,1568432835.0,"I feel the same way as you do. I tried talking my parents about it multiple times, and all they  can say is that its ""too much for them to handle, and that they have to get away from me.""

 I tryed talking to people that I thought were my friends but they ended up avoiding contact with me like I'm some kind of plague. And even my ex girlfriend of 5 years wanted nothing to do with it.  Instead she told everyone that I know behind my back, Friends and family. And so now I've lost pretty much everyone.

 It's rather unfortunate, Just wouldn't think people would be like that,  Not the ones that you love the most."
