I have had a relatively stable mood for quite some time, and it feels weird to be able to make commitments and finally be able to follow through without worries of becoming depressed and hopeless.


It really does take time and effort, but it’s worth it. What helped me the most was taking care of my body. I exercise frequently, eat well most of the time, and typically get good sleep. Those three things may sound silly, but they are fundamental in treating the disorder. On top of that, I work with a psychiatrist for my medication(I’ve been through a million combos, but finally have one that works), and I work with a therapist through my school(if you can’t find one, try the Woebot app. Not as good as a real therapist, but it is incredibly helpful when it comes to negative moods, anxiety, and depression).

There are different ways to can hold your session.

1) Problem solve- come in with a problem you need help to handle, and work it out with them in a healthy and constructive way.

2) Vent/rant- sometimes you just need to talk, and that’s okay, as well! You can do this with negative emotion, but also positive and neutral emotions! Sometimes I just say whatever is on my mind at the time, and this can help process or just getting stuff out of your head and into the open.

3) Challenge negative thoughts/ cognitive distortions- It can be hard sometimes to fight back against negative thoughts on your own, so working through them with a therapist can be very useful, as they see your thoughts from the point of view of someone outside your brain, and can pick up on things that aren’t true or aren’t helpful/constructive

4) Work on coping skills for your mental toolbox!- Your therapist can help you to find ways to deal with mental/physical issues when you are alone and have to work on it by yourself. They can teach grounding, how to deal with anxiety/depression, and just get yourself to a better state of mind on your own.

There are probably many more, but my ADHD meds just wore off, so my thoughts are a bit scattered.

One smart thing to do would be to make notes of things during the week, leading up to your appointment. This could be questions, solutions, things that are bothering you, unhealthy thoughts, whatever! This can help, because you can bring these notes into the session so you don’t forget what has been going on, or what you wanted to talk about! This one really helps me :)

I don’t know if I helped at all, but hopefully this can be a starting point! If you have any more specific questions, I would be happy to answer them :)"

Catswithjobs,fr2q79g,t3_gm4n6v,1589841809.0,That’s photoshop :/
Cringetopia,fr2q30j,t1_fr2ps2k,1589841745.0,"No problem! It was the least I can do, I realized that I didn’t know enough to see the whole situation for what it really was. I’m just glad I know better now!"
Cringetopia,fr2pp0s,t1_fr2p6qn,1589841543.0,"Oh, that’s good news! Sorry, I’m still very new to this and still learning!  So breeding is probably the big problem, lots of black and white, huh? If so, advocating for safe and responsible breeding is probably smart(/already being done?)"
Cringetopia,fr2ogpg,t1_fr2o34m,1589840903.0,"Yes, I was just educated on this over in the banpitbulls sub. I didn’t realize they were specifically bred to fight. I feel awful for the dogs, but I do now see that they have dangerous tendencies. It’s really sad that they were brought into this world and can’t escape having those tendencies, because even as good as they can be, they still are unsafe in the long run. :( just kind of an all over shitty situation"
Cringetopia,fr2n69r,t1_fr2n3zh,1589840251.0,"It’s all good, I probably would have done the same at one point or another. You too!"
BanPitBulls,fr2iq9s,t1_fr2igku,1589837993.0,Gotcha! Thanks for taking time out of your day to help me out :)
BadMUAs,fr2g3q5,t3_gm7vvq,1589836685.0,It’s in her hair!!!
BanPitBulls,fr2eoq2,t1_fr2dwm3,1589835972.0,Thanks! Have a nice day! :)
BanPitBulls,fr2en7o,t1_fr2dsrk,1589835951.0,"I see, thank you! I didn’t realize that there were different types of mouths, so I assumed all big dogs had similar bites. Thank you for clarifying!"
BanPitBulls,fr2csl1,t1_fr2clf0,1589835065.0,"Awesome! That’s what I was afraid this movement was about, and I’m very glad it is not! Again, thanks for being kind enough to give me a chance and educate me :)"
BanPitBulls,fr2bvya,t1_fr2brqc,1589834629.0,Thank you so much! I really appreciate it! So I’m guessing you don’t encourage the type of behavior in the post that led me here?
BanPitBulls,fr2ahsz,t1_fr29orc,1589833941.0,"Wow, you really cane through for me, thank you! I think a lot of what I knew must have been biased beforehand, when I had no way of knowing. The misconception out there is that you guys want to kill them or put them down, which is not the case. I think I support the idea of banning breeding, that is a good step for these dogs, and can also be a good step for many breeds and animals(like how feral/stray cats should follow TNR, trap, neuter, and release to stop the spread of cat colonies that are causing harm to the environment). I previously thought banning meant getting rid of all of them, and again, I now see that is not true. Thanks for taking the time to help me out :)"
Cringetopia,fr28l17,t1_fr28erh,1589833008.0,"Yeah, I see. I can be too quick to get heated, but I’m trying to not let that happen as much. I am the same way, I’ve never encountered one that has shown any agression, so I didn’t realize they posed any danger. Thanks for the stats, I do see there is a trend."
Cringetopia,fr27tui,t1_fr27790,1589832636.0,"I just made a post on their sub, would you mind if we continue our chat there so I can keep track of information? I’m trying to be open about listening to your views before making too quick of a judgement."
Cringetopia,fr26h7p,t1_fr25ywa,1589831970.0,Edit: ‘twas an uninformed comment I now see is wrong
Cringetopia,fr26619,t1_fr264aw,1589831820.0,"Yeah, no problem. I would be a hypocrite if I refused."
Cringetopia,fr25y2k,t1_fr25knf,1589831714.0,"If you are willing to have an unbiased conversation, I do not have discord, so I am unable to chat there, and I don’t know if I am comfortable having that conversation on a sub where everyone is against my opinion, but I will give it a shot."
