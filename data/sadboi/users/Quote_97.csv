Also, when you beat Lambert at Gwent he gives you Triss' card, and when you screw people in the Witcher 1 you get a card of them.

Now I don't really agree with that because the footprints actually lead from her washbasin to her window, where there is other stuff she could've left her washbasin to grab. I also don't think the bottom of Lambert's feet would've been caked in shit if he was screwing her in either the bed or the basin. Also, he was supposed to be in Kaedwen(?) or wherever looking for Salamandra, and if he eventually came to Vizima, he woudl've been helping Geralt.

Triss' card doesn't really mean anything either

It's definitely a half-sword. I guarantee if someone jammed a sword into your gut like that, (without the armor, obviously)and all you were wearing was a light gambeson, you wouldn't be on your feet after your opponent managed to pull the sword out, which I'd wager would have gone out your back as well.

In this picture, my opponent is wearing a brigandine and mail hauberk, so I'm not expecting it to do much damage, but if those were removed and only the Aketon was there, I can't believe someone would be able to stay on their feet. I agree you might not die for a while, but I highly doubt that someone could continue a fight where someone is using all of their power to try to kill you, especially in hand to hand combat.

The half-sword is a technique where you grip the blade halfway up and use it to gain finer control over the point. It has nothing to do with a slashing attack.

If you have evidence I'm wrong, I'd be glad to see it, but from the power and focus I see in that stab, the point of the sword would go straight through the gambeson and through their abdomen. There would be no way someone could still fight after a blow like that."

The scoiatael are really interesting to me in how they present a moral dilemna, like yes they're oppressed and have shit smeared on their doors and have every right to be angry as fuck but then they go and flay people alive apparently and burn down villages and kill innocent people. It doesn't make me hate them but I kill them when I have to.

Plus Roche got a really cute moment after geralt boned Triss and he busts in through the wall and he's like ""wow... this is nice!""

Too dumb to get into a good college

Too weak to be good physically

Too uncoordinated to be good at sports

Too ugly to have a girl not turn up her eyes at me

Too bad with people to be charismatic or have a lot of people like me  


And I've been here before, multiple times over the last six years. Every time, I told myself that there's still hope. I can still grow taller. I can still become smarter. I can still become attractive. I can still be good at sports. I believed I still had a chance to live life like everyone else I knew.  


I thought the things I was doing to not become a human piece of shit were working. I went to a 4-hour class every weekday over the summer and got a 35 on my ACT. In the past five years, I got haircuts, started dressing well, started a skincare routine. I started lifting weights, and I joined a rowing team, and even though I was bad at it, I was okay with it because I tried really hard. I read books, looked at role models. I became confident, became a leader, had people who would follow me.  


This year was supposed to be the year I finally succeeded at something. I was done being weak; I wanted a rowing national championship. I wanted to get into a good college. I wanted a girlfriend. I wanted friends who liked me as much as I liked them.  


Got rejected from virtually every college I applied to. Got cut from my crew team, even after I worked the hardest I'd ever worked in my life for more than 2 months straight; Even though I finally became an acceptably fast rower, with a time that people from my school have won nationals with. Got rejected by my crush of two years. Now all my friends are ghosting me and don't open my texts.  


I tried. I tried so hard, I believed in myself so much, and did so many things that terrified me, but I believed if I did it then I would finally become a good person. If the effort I put in wasn't enough to drag me out of the pile of shit I live in, then I'm done. I can't do anymore. There's no hope for my future.

Rowing,ff30ipn,t1_ff2dfer,1579530395.0,"You might be somewhat right about having a bit too much high intensity, but it’s worked before and I’m not sure I can take the risk of taking out one of those faster pieces in that it could make me faster, but could also make me slower, and anyone asking me why would tell me I’m soft cause I couldn’t handle what everyone else is doing, which is 2 high intensity pieces a week

I’ve not heard of normal rowing workouts going for more than 90 minutes unless someone is doing a marathon or something. Doesn’t the 2-3 hour thing apply to bike rides? Also some more information I should add: I’ve done my workouts the past few days is 50 on the erg and 40 on the bike

Also concerning running, I thought doing really long 2-3 hour runs was to prepare your body for marathons? Seems kind of an overkill distance for a 3K

Thanks for taking the time to write out a reply though"
