NeverHaveIEverShow,fpdukn4,t3_gcl7xw,1588534533.0,"I actually started watching because I came downstairs and saw my mom was midway through the third episode on her own! She offered to start from the beginning and we binge-watched the whole season yesterday afternoon. My dad and brother joined in around episode 7, and we all loved it! My mom found Devi to be a very worrying character to watch just because of the stunts she pulled, and my dad just thought she was hilarious (and Ben is his favorite character). I think it was a really great bonding time for our family."

PokemonTabletop,fnzvfe2,t3_fyq9lh,1587401433.0,"Musician and maybe prism (prism for the big, bright attacks reminiscent of the lights an edm show perhaps)? Get yourself an Exploud (duh), chatot, and a Noivern (supersonic, etc). A lot of the 'sound'/'music' moves are normal type, so, hell, you can even go normal type ace and typeshift the noivern. Drampa gets echoed voices which is flavorfolly nice and synergizes well w normal ace, too."
PokemonTabletop,flh0vz4,t1_flgg314,1585154021.0,Fortress and Berserker are both Game of Throhs! Berserker is a physical attacking build that is ...like if you used taskmaster but on yourself. Basically it does damage if enraged and injured.
PokemonTabletop,flf29zg,t3_f8hlxj,1585096449.0,"Berserker or Fortress, without a doubt. I love zerker because of the ridiculous damage it puts out, and fortress because of the stupid DR it allows one to stack. Playing a berserker is especially fun because you are playing a careful game of taking on injuries without killing yourself."
