mentalhealth,fhfx4ao,t1_fhftj02,1581553384.0,"I agree, this guy sounded so unprofessional, I would also check his licensure. Which is highlighted in the article you attached. 

I would also ask, what kind of patients do your normally work with? While a psychologist may be willing to work with everyone per say, they may have the most experience with PTSD, bipolar, or something else. This can affect how much knowledge they have on other disorders. If they dont see autism regularly, they usually don't have the most up to date information on it. I mention this because the idea of someone can only have autism if they are nonverbal is outdated for years. In fact, even in 2013 updates to the diagnosis criteria and tests were made. One change, is that asperger's is no longer in it's own category, and Autism is now considered a spectrum. 

So, I was diagnosed with asperger's back in 2012. In my recent evaluation they called it Autism Spectrum Disorder: High Functioning Autism Level 1. It's literally the same thing, so I'm not sure why it changed, but it did lol. The title doesn't matter as much as long as they have the appropriate liscensjee and are up to date with the information. The first who diagnosed me was a psychologist, then I got reevaluated and an updated version of the same diagnosis by a liscensed clinical social worker, and then it was reconfirmed by a psychiatrist."
mentalillness,fhfuom1,t3_f2sxlv,1581551724.0,"Yes! It is incredibly crucial to get professional diagnosis! And yes, a good professional takes time to accurately diagnose someone.

Reason 1) so many mental disorders share symptoms. For example, look at the symptom of psychosis. It can be a symptom of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It could be from bipolar disorder, where a period of mania lasts too long. It can happen with untreated PTSD or Depression. It can also be from extreme grief or stress. Even giving birth can cause a period of psychosis (I believe the technical term is post partum psychosis)

When you consider how many symptoms overlap, it can be so difficult to tell. This is why misdiagnosis is common. In fact, I have been misdiagnosed by civilian doctors who had no access to my medical history. After just a few sittings, they believed me to be schizoaffective or bipolar. This is because I was experiencing flashbacks of my my time in a combat zone, but didn't believe me to be a combat veteran due to my gender. However, some of the other symptoms seemed to make sense.

Then, when my paperwork and everything got processed through the VA, I was able to see people who both had access to my medical record and military, and a few who could see me on a long term basis. After 6 months of working with me, they explained I dont have a mood disorder at all, that in fact I have PTSD, which he said can look like schizoaffective disorder. Moreover, he noticed that in my medical history, I was diagnosed with asperger's, which is commonly mistaken for bipolar disorder in females. 

Finally getting an accurate diagnosis meant getting a treatment plan that actually worked for me. I have now been getting treatment through the VA for 2 years. My diagnosis has been reviewed and reconfirmed by a few people, and I have been stable ever since. I even learned the reason my symptoms got so severe was because instead of seeking help I used to just try to keep myself busy and ignore it. Now I was facing the problem head on and healing.

While many people may argue that this is an example of drs. Being inadequate I completely disagree. Like I said, the civilian dr did not have the same access to my history the ones at the VA did. Not to mention, be had to come up with something quickly for insurance purposes. However, I have met drs in both civilian and veteran side who understand it takes a lot of time to get to know someone before an accurate diagnosis is possible, usually six months to a year. While they do tell the insurance what they suspect the diagnosis is, they tend to wait longer to be sure before considering it the ""official diagnosis"" and discussing it with a patient. These are the kind of professionals I'd look for when you first seek a diagnosis. Not someone who gives you one after the first session, then a prescription for pills. One who takes the time to get to know you first.


While some may say, ""well I know myself better than these doctors"", that part can be true. However, it does not mean you know the different kinds of disorders, their overlapping symptoms, and how to differentiate between them better than a mental health professional can. They spend years learning about various disorders, and copious training hours just to get the liscense to diagnose people. Self diagnoses on the other hand are limited to what they hear about and what Google search engines pull up. Unfortunately the results tend to be that you only  hear about whatever is ""trending"" at the time. While some symptoms may match or give you an idea, again there are so many disorders with overlapping symptoms and needs professional help to differentiate. Seeking a professional may confirm or suspicions, or you may find it is something else.

For example, I had an old acquaintance who diagnosed herself with asperger's. To me, it didn't seem right, as she didn't express sensory disorder, no need for routine and patterns, and seemed to just ""know"" how to behave in social situations and would often lecture me if I did or said something I didn't know was ""inappropriate"". However, I'm not a professional, I'm just someone with asperger's myself, I can't diagnose, but I told her she should talk to someone who can. As a result, she found out that she doesn't have asperger's at all, but instead general anxiety disorder and needed medication for it. Now she is happier and healthier and making new friends. 

So at best, when you inaccurately diagnose yourself you are misrepresenting those who have recieved a proper diagnosis, adding to the false narrative society has on it. At worse, those who self diagnose are usually not getting professional help for their distress and the problems. This can lead to their symptoms becoming more severe, and at it's most dangerous the symptoms can get so bad you can experience a mental breakdown or risk hurting yourself and others.

However, self diagnosing is a societal inevitability regardless of the dangers. The main reason is because of how expensive health care is. Then there is also the stigma about it, and how it is treated by society either as something to fear or something that is ""trendy"" ""glamorous"" and makes you ""quirky/special""."

mentalhealth,fh9848h,t3_f1widu,1581375249.0,"Let me start by saying I'm not a professional and I do recommend seeking professional help for a proper answer/diagnoses.

Now again, I'm not saying you have this, but I would recommend looking up mood disorders. I have a relative who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (which is one kind of mood disorder), and most of the time she is very functional. However she has points in her life where she becomes hypomanic where she is motivated to be very productive to an excessive extent, starts more projects than she can complete, becomes more energetic, more irritable, spends more money, and sleeps less. This can sometimes develop into full manic experience but not always. During the fully manic periods, she experiences euphoria, overconfidence, over abundance of energy, constantly works on projects, depletes her savings, becomes incredibly impulsive, and does not sleep. Again, it doesn't always get this extreme, but sometimes it does. Her manic period is usually followed by a period of depression, where she isolates herself, stays in bed, becomes emotional and guilty, and eats very little. Her first episode was at 18. Mood disorders can develop a little later in life. 

So if you are having symptoms of a lot of energy, increased motivation (more than usual), followed by a period of depression, I would definitely ask a professional about it, especially if the problem is big enough to have an impact on your daily life. It could simply be hormonal changes, it could be a mood disorder, increased stress, insomnia, fatigue, or something else entirely. It could even be a combination of things, or it could be nothing to worry about at all. Only a professional can give you a more accurate answer and help you get an effective treatment plan.

P.s. if you are a sexually active female, it could be pregnancy. After all, mood swings are a very common symptom of pregnancy."
mentalillness,fh9547j,t3_f1vtz1,1581373546.0,"You have written such a well thought out essay.

Healthy escapism can be a great coping mechanism, and have many benefits. In the moment it can relax you, and give you a break from environmental stressors. Depending on your preferred form, it can even help you create skills. For example, gaming has been proven to increase cognitive ability and critical thinking. Blogging increases written communication. Travel, art, and hobbies all expand skills and creative thinking. Though when used properly escapism is part of a healthy lifestyle, not many know that it can become unhealthy and ruin your life. I am grateful you shared your experience to help bring awareness to the issue.

One of the examples you have mentioned is social media and online community. Again, when used properly it can be a great way to connect and meet other people.  These online relationships can translate to friendships in the real world, or simply give you people to talk to. However, spending time online does give your brain a dose of dopamine, making it easy to develop an addiction. When social media begins to affect your real life, and you start to obsession, then it's a problem. Moreover, your online presence can become your sense of identity, making you feel like you are only work the amount of ""likes"" or clout you get. You have perfectly articulated the dangers of perusing social media fame. I think many people assume it is fun and easy, not knowing how dark and difficult that road is, and how easy it is to lose your identity and self worth. Your post shines light on this information.

Another aspect that you mentioned that I thought was very insightful is highlighting just how important it is to not just focus on virtual interactions and achievements, but to ensure you can form real world relationships and accomplish real world goals. In fact there has been a few studies done in Japan about how virtual relationships are beginning to have a negative effect on the country. The reason is more people are beginning to turn to dating sims instead of having a real relationship. They say things like ""it's easier"" ""she's always there for me when I need her, is always happy to see me, never argues, never complains"", ""I'm to busy, so it fits my schedule"". This preference for virtual relationships has contributed to decline of human relationships and the rapidly declining birthrate. As a result, there are fewer young people to pay for the taxes and care for the aging nation. On a personal level, its sacrificing their ability to learn conflict resolution, compromise, and other skills you learn only by developing human relationships.

While virtual worlds and escapism can be great and can feel good, as you said, placing too much value on things that are not real is dangerous. It must be hard spending so much time am effort on escapism, only to feel like you have nothing tangible. I dont know if this helps, but in my perspective, you have gained a small something. Your essay shows that you have excellent written communication skills, which you probably honed through your blogging and social media efforts. You were willing to be vulnerable and share your experience. It was this experience, how it effects your life, and how you feel about it now that gives you the unique ability to help others going through the same thing. 

Either way, I am grateful to you for sharing your personal story and hope that it facilitates a much needed discussion about healthy vs unhealthy escapism."

I had a psychotic break because my ptsd and insomnia went untreated for too long. I began thinking the government was out to get me, the world was a video game and I could see it glitch, and there was a man with no eyes following me everywhere. My spouse initially thought I was ""faking"" or ""trying to be funny""so no one knew how badly I needed help until it was way too late. 

My therapist explained to me that even severe grief and giving birth can cause psychosis, but few know that. This lack of awareness is what creates so many problems and prevents people from getting the help that is desperately needed."

I know that it is incredibly difficult for most people, and even for those who have insurance, most companies won't cover more than 8 sessions. However, it is also important to know that in order to get an accurate explanation, and effective advice/treatment you will need a professional. 

It's just like if you notice a strange bump on your body. It could be a cyst or a boil, it could be cancer, it could be something else entirely. You can try to diagnose it with the internet and treat if yourself, and it may work, or if could make the situation worse. 

And again, access to medical care is a huge problem in this country and most cant afford it. The best thing you can do is contact your local NAMI or another program that can get you in contact with a social worker. A social worker can help you find more affordable or even free care.

While I understand you probably want help and answers now, it is important to know the answers you find here will likely be wrong. Regardless, I wish you the best and hope you can find information that works for you"
mentalhealth,fh3e70l,t3_f18jfb,1581268002.0,"Truly, all you can do, and the healthiest thing you can do, is give advice and then let go. Two of the hardest things to accept in life, is that we can only control and make decisions for ourselves and that we are not responsible for another person's happiness, no matter how much we love them. Even if you can prove it is in her best interest, at the end of the day it is her decision. 

So you can give her advice, maybe show her some resources that may help, but if she doesn't take those steps herself, you have to accept that at let it go. She may not be ready, she may be too scared, or perhaps she just wants to figure it out on her own. Regardless of the reason you have to just accept her free will, then support her decision and love her. Accept that it is not your job to make her happy, you can only do that for yourself.

And I do completely understand how hard it is. I have friends who have been in toxic relationships that have taken them years to get out of. Even my husband has been refusing to seek treatment for his mental health problems, despite having so many free resources and a large support network encouraging him. He simply isn't ready. All I can do is make sure I am taking care of myself and I seek treatment for myself.

Another aspect to be mindful of, is that while it is natural to worry about a loved one, if it starts to hinder your ability to care for yourself, work on your own problems, or find happiness in your own life, or indicates a codependent relationship is forming. I'm not saying this describes your relationship at all,  it's just something to be aware of as it can easily happen when a loved one is in a bad position.

Good luck and I hope everything turns out for the best for the both of you. Also, congratulations on your accomplishments and leaving the house despite your mental illness. You managed to achieve something not everyone is capable of doing, which is incredible."
