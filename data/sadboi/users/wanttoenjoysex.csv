-our foods are not regulated enough by the FDA, we have known carcinogens in our grocery store foods

-the culture is so religious that some places don't
 provide proper sex education to students

-the rate of school shootings/mass shootings

-our method for electing political figures needs an overhaul. You end up with two drastically different choices rather than having the ability to vote on each issue separately or at least having many different political parties (that stand a chance at winning)

-path to citizenship is too difficult 

-other countries are more environmentally conscious than the U.S.

Was called a slut by my mom. Turning it around on me saying how could you put us through this grief and we put off important things to attend to this issue.
