DidntKnowIWantedThat,fjszlz5,t1_fjsut8l,1583601881.0,"I’m not dismissing the complaints, you’re dismissing help and whining about an easy to fix issue. It’s about working around a problem: the virtual keyboard. If I could I’d give you a smartphone with a physical keyboard, but I can’t so I’m trying to help you work around it. 


I figured you might need help because you didn’t explicitly say you didn’t need any in your original comment. In fact, you only JUST said so! I would’ve left you alone if you said you just wanted to complain and needed 0 help. All the stuff I mentioned (expanding keyboard, turning off autocorrect, not using STT/VTT, getting a phone pen instead of VTT) would help if you actually used it, but you clearly have not. 


You’re gonna have to get used to the virtual keyboard which I think is the issue here. I can type without looking because I’m used to it. It’s not going away anytime soon. My siblings are your age and have never complained about virtual keyboards. 


If it’s a huge issue, get a flip phone or a slide phone. Sorry I can’t do anything for you but you’re gonna have to deal with it, or contact some customer service line for a phone company that you’d like to see a physical feature implemented or complain that VTT has network issues or is inaccurate. Have a wonderful day :)"
DidntKnowIWantedThat,fjsmter,t1_fjq7shq,1583598694.0,"I’m not missing the point? I was trying to help you out. Virtual keyboards can be just as accurate as a physical one. You’re just more used to the physical keyboard, but you gotta get used to the virtual keyboard too. That’s your issue. 


I don’t use any of those special features or autocorrect and my accuracy is just fine. I have no idea what you’re going on about at this point, but I get the feeling you just want to complain. Those features I suggested would help you out."

DidntKnowIWantedThat,fjq2ehx,t1_fjq0b9v,1583566167.0,"Sorry I didn’t see that! 


You can expand the android keyboard by downloading specific keyboard apps from the google play store. Not sure of the names but I do know they exist. 


Also, swiping to type is an interpretation of what you’re trying to say. It’ll be hard to train it otherwise unless you edit it a lot. But I don’t know the specifics so it might not. 
Though I can’t fix the issue with the work gloves, that is highly inconvenient. I’m sorry you have to deal with that. 


You can also turn off autocorrect in settings to avoid it trying to correct your wife’s name. I suppose there might be a way to add words to the dictionary onto your phone. I know iphone has/had that option but I’m not sure if Android does.

notliketheothergirls,fe6ozgh,t1_fe6ee4x,1578898770.0,"The main flaw in your argument here is that you're failing to realize that condoms break and other forms of birth control do fail. Birth control is never 100% no matter what form you use. 

There is also this thing called stealthing-where a man will remove the condom mid sex and cum inside the woman without her consent. This is sexual assault and not what the woman consented to. Rape is also a huge factor here. 

Medical issues like ectopic pregnancy exist-this is life threatening to the woman and the pregnancy is not viable. The baby will not survive, as the egg is in the fallopian tubes. The egg must be in the uterus to grow and thrive. The logical thing to do is to terminate the pregnancy. Genetic birth defects can also affect a baby's quality of life depending on its severity and what kind of defect it is. 

Before the whole ""just give them up for adoption"" argument-realize that in the US, many people are without health insurance and will get thousands into debt to take care of the baby during pregnancy. There is also no guarantee a child will be adopted, as it costs anywhere from $40-50k to adopt a kid. There are over 428k children in the foster system-only about 135k kids are adopted each year. More than half spend 2-5 years in the system. If you count for the child's first few years, this is a critical development stage where it'll leave the child with a sense of loss, rejection, and lack of identity. It is also very unhealthy for children to be sent from home to home, as it can cause anxiety and depression. However, I do believe for some people, adoption is the right choice. I want them to have that option if they want it. Hence ""pro-choice.""

One thing that people refuse to acknowledge is how traumatizing abortion is. No one WANTS abortion. No one wants to kill innocent babies here, especially not up to 40 weeks. Abortion must be done ASAP. It is not like a shopping trip or another form of birth control like people make it out to be. There are a lot of feelings of guilt and sadness associated with the procedure. In fact, women who go through abortions may experience a form of PTSD. Some women may feel relief and be more open about it. Not everyone feels the same way. Abortion isn't right for everyone, but it is right for some people. 

But you cannot deny something: whether or not abortion is legal women WILL do it. It's easier and safer to have one done in a clinical setting than in your backyard with a coat hanger. 

The logical compromise here is to make it easier to access birth control, increase sex education, make the adoption process easier and cheaper, and create programs to help pregnant women with unexpected pregnancies."

AskReddit,f2uqokx,t3_deemmt,1570425002.0,"Difference of opinion and to say fuck or other swear words like I'm a perfect little drone.
I hate having a fake act around my parents."
AskReddit,f2uqb22,t3_deepiv,1570424586.0,I like to practice mindfulness. I sometimes panic before bed and it helps me relax and fall asleep.
AskReddit,f2upfgj,t1_f2unv5c,1570423627.0,I'm 18 and my dad won't even let me do that. Idk but it seems to me parents are more protective than ever now
AskReddit,f2up5nk,t3_deefmz,1570423345.0,"Depends on the day, but I usually wake up pretty late and I eat a pretty big lunch anyways. Plus I don't like a whole lot of conventional breakfast foods."

FuckYouKaren,f1t4v9k,t3_dafnfs,1569738806.0,"I'm not a teacher, but as a theater employee the lack of discipline for people's kids is fucking astounding. We're always the ones at fault when your kid sneaks into r rated movies and gets kicked out. Like your kid didn't do something illegal. 

I have so much respect for teachers man. The amount of disrespect they receive from students and parents is incredible. Not surprised they want a pay raise, they get paid jack shit to deal with shitty kids and parents."
AMA,ez2s9ft,t1_ez2nru2,1567658351.0,That is awful. I hope things get better for you from here.
AMA,ez2n4lc,t1_ez2l80w,1567656798.0,You did just fine! I've always been curious abt what living as a mute was like.
AMA,ez2k774,t1_ez2io0i,1567656222.0,Definitely! I agree with you there. I'd say it is a disability because what happens when you don't have access of a way to communicate? You're stuck and can't explain why you need help. I hope this AMA helps ppl understand these struggles more!
AMA,ez2h1dm,t1_ez2fucb,1567655532.0,"Thank you! And I totally get that. The bible belt is fucking wild- you don't deserve that pain. You went through something they are privileged enough not to experience. It's terrible they treat you that way.

You and your mom sound like such wonderful people!"
AMA,ez2fc4q,t1_ez2dus7,1567655112.0,"You are so, very incredibly lucky to survive and I'm proud of you for going through this. I had jaw surgery 2 months ago and the liquid diet made me go insane, despite only being a week and a half long. Anesthesia is super fucky so it's really no surprise you couldn't remember anything. 

Fuck is my favorite word to say too! I wish you much luck for the future with speaking. I think it's sweet that you love your mom that much. On the voice, I'm so sorry people judge you. Voices are so incredibly unique and should not be judged. Especially after getting a surgery like this. I hope you have a fantastic week!"
AMA,ez2b342,t3_czmxyn,1567654163.0,"What was the recovery like? What's your favorite word to say? 
Btw I think it's amazing you went thru this surgery. It must've been terrifying to go through."
AskReddit,eyey4cv,t1_eyew5ag,1567040674.0,"Agreed. Although I gotta give them credit-our theater IS super understaffed (not on purpose, but rather most people are here are during college holidays). It's still annoying as FUCK though"

AskReddit,ex0egtz,t1_ex0dk7p,1565911039.0,"I... are you listening to yourself? He can move closer to his job and bring that vacation shit to court. If he can vote, MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR HIMSELF, HE IS A FREE MAN. If you think that's slavery you are pretty privileged and haven't seen anything terrible or you don't know what slavery is. Stress is an entirely different beast and I hope you realize that."
