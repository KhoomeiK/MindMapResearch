HairDye,fr2xx2o,t3_gmda39,1589846034.0,"So I was actually trying to achieve that lavender gray color to use as a base for the dark smokey blue I am planning to put over it (lime crime blue smoke). I started in the front because that section went way more yellow when I lightened but I think I a) applied too much toner and b) left it on too long. I started to run out by the time I got to that back section so I ended up with a nice platinum on one 1/4 of my hair, lavender on on the front 1/2 and a slightly lighter lavender on the last one 1/4. Should I just tone again and mainly focus on that back section? Should i just let the purple fade out? Not entirely sure how long that would take. Or do you think I’ll be ok to put on the blue as is? I just want it to come out as even as possible and I worry having a two tone canvas, I will most certainly not achieve that. Thanks in advance for the help!!"

And yes, I know that getting married and having a family isn’t the most important thing in life, but like many other women I was kind of always taught that having a husband and babies was what I was supposed to strive for. And i just feel so fucking worthless and defeated when I don’t even get likes on dating apps."
