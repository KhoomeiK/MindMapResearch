minimalism,fqw58ya,t3_gkajig,1589693225.0,"I think I gravitated toward minimalism because of my father. Growing up we always had a cluttered home which made it hard for my mom to properly clean. My father would take daily trips to the dump to see what he could bring home. Our basement, garage and yard was loaded with junk. From time to time her would become obsessed with collecting something new-old trains, fishing reels, antique glass- and would waste our money on eBay. I hated it not to mention he was lazy and couldn‚Äôt clean up after himself. I avoided having friends and significant others over because everyone else had such clean homes and I didn‚Äôt."
PanPorn,fqg5xrd,t3_gib4xv,1589338677.0,Did yours kind of rub off your skin? Mine would burn when I would apply it and when it dried it would rub off.

I had purchased it while I was working though a couple other moisturizers so it might have just been old.

My first IT project was a disaster. I was new to SAP so I was relying heavily on the SMEs who just didn't have the answer to the solution. The project ended up getting canceled which was a relief but if I could do it over again I would have held more group design sessions and recorded meeting minutes so people couldn't go back on what they stated."

loseit,foice37,t3_g7bb1x,1587783414.0,"I know that feeling of wanting to make progress but not having the mental capacity for it. I was stressed out from my job and school and I wanted nothing to do with cooking or tracking macros for the longest time. What helped me during that time was finding a small business that made meals with the calories/carbs/fats/proteins on the box. I got 2/day and had the same breakfast everyday. Since each meal was 450-550, I just designed a breakfast that gave me the rest of my calories and that was it. I didn't think about it I just got my meals and ate. Things got better at work and my difficult class ended and I had gained the motivation to try again having made progress from the prepped meals."
loseit,foibf5g,t3_g7k49q,1587782779.0,"I used to track my macros all the time until I got used to eyeing serving sizes and eating the same types of foods in the same quantities. I now have a general idea of how many calories I am consuming and can maintain pretty easily. A popular diet plan -21 day fix might be ideal. You track containers instead of calories. For example, you have so many yellow containers which equals so many carbs. This would put you in a caloric range and wouldn't require you to weight your food or scan anything into an app."
loseit,foiatwa,t3_g7lq77,1587782400.0,"Yay! Congratulations on starting your journey! I would stay away from all types of juice unless you only drink about 4oz a day. They are high in sugar and you shouldn't have more than if you juiced 2 servings of fruit. Fruit has fiber which is great so have an orange and a glass of water:)

I would update your stats in your app to reflect an active lifestyle now that you are working out  5 days a week. Good job!

And lastly, it is true you can't out-train a bad diet. Start small, with the substitutions you mentioned, that's a great start! You want to take small steps toward a 90% clean diet. Focus on eating more lean protein like chicken, ground turkey, and lean ground beef. Also healthy fats like avocados, salmon, and olive oil. Measuring out your food and logging it into your app will give you an idea of how your should change your diet. And the biggest thing that really helped me was quitting sugar. You won't believe how it's just in everything! 

Best of luck!"

Over all, I think it was worth the money but I will be reviewing my products and I will be looking to see if they tailor more to my preferences in the next couple boxes. I‚Äôm glad they are changing the subscriptions to include a bag with the GBP subscription and allowing you to choose one of your items. I‚Äôm hoping they include more high-end products that we won‚Äôt have to question.** 

**ILLAMASQUA Antimatter Lipstick in Midnight**

**First Impression: I wasn‚Äôt thrilled to receive a red in my first bag considering I chose rarely in my survey. The color is nice but I don‚Äôt see myself using this. I tried to dab it on hoping it was creamy enough to give me a hint of color but no luck. I applied it as a normal lipstick and found it to be good enough, kind of like your grandmother‚Äôs red lipstick. This will continuously leave lipstick marks but somehow manage to completely stay on so there‚Äôs that.** 

**WANDER BEAUTY Wanderess‚Ñ¢ Seascape Eyeshadow Palette**

**First Impression: The colors are beautiful but I‚Äôm skeptical of the quality of the shadows. The matte shade seemed good but the shimmer shades have chunky glitter, the formula doesn‚Äôt seem consistent between the 6 shades and the green is a let down from the color in the pan and the actual swatch. I‚Äôm going to try my best to make this work but these shadows will not work at the office or even casual dinners.**

**OFRA x Madison Miller Squad Palette**

**First Impression: I was the most excited for this pallet. The blush shade will probably end up being my go-to this fall. The far right highlighter will probably be the untouched shade in this pallet as the swatch seems chunky. Maybe it can serve as a shadow. I love the packaging however, and the mirror is nice.** 

**CIAT√â LONDON Extraordinary Translucent Powder** 

**First Impression: I picked up one of these in the FFF add-on sale. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to try it out yet as my Laura Mercier translucent powder hasn‚Äôt run out yet. I guess I don‚Äôt go through as much powder as I thought I did lol.**

**PARIS HILTON SKINCARE ProD.N.A. Dual-Action Cleansing Gel**

**First Impression: So I completely expected this to smell similar to her perfume but it smells like a cleanser that‚Äôs going to clean my pores. In other words, it doesn‚Äôt seem to have any fragrence. I haven‚Äôt tried this yet** 

**but I‚Äôm looking forward to as the reviews for it are pretty good and so are the ingredients. Hopefully the shimmer will completely wash off LOL**"
