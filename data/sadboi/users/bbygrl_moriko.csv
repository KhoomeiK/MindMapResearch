BPD,foisy50,t1_foirmwb,1587795988.0,"Let her be however she wants to be. And I’m not speaking for her. She has lived her whole life being her, it is impossible for us to change our mothers. 

When she does this, think to yourself “blah blah blah, this poor lady really needs a listener doesn’t she. Although she’s talking nonsense, I guess I can pretend that I’m listening for a minute.” You don’t have to let her words in because you know it’s not true. Just pretend that she’s one of those weird lonely old ladies in the cartoons who always complain about everything and she probably doesn’t even know what she’s talking about. I find this method easier for me to tolerate my mother’s toxicity and avoid arguments. 

I wish you the best luck getting through this quarantine healthy both physically and mentally! We can do this."
BPD,foir1p8,t1_foip3ue,1587794274.0,"I’m sorry about your situation. I agree that mindfulness is very difficult to start. At first I didn’t think it worked, it took me a very long time to find my inner peace. 
I am temporarily living with my mom who is the major reason of my BPD. Although I spend most of my time in my room alone, we still find conflicts here and there. What I do is when I’m about to flip out, I force myself to stop trying to argue and go back to my room and watch my favorite video of snoopy dance. Snoopy always makes me happy and relax. The point is, when you need to let out your feelings, find yourself a healthy way out. Find something that comforts you instead of people who fights against you. It will be a good start."

It helps you realize about yourself, find your feelings and clear your thoughts. I have been doing very well during this quarantine thanks to mindfulness."

It’s not my job to fix everything and it’s not always my mental health illness. “I AM NOT MY DISORDER”"

The easiest way to deal with Nparents is to walk away, they look for fights and dramas so don’t give them that. Once you engage you are only going to hurt yourself. 

Remember it’s a long way to go to fully acquire the skills and power. I flipped out on my Nmom last weekend and I regretted it that I fed into her needs once again. I could’ve hold myself there and count to 10 but I straight up flipped out. And the result of that?
