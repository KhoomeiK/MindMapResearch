I think the only way to identify anything going weird is already to have a stable, trustworthy perception of reality when sober, which is why I think it’s a bad idea for younger psychonauts to experiment with these substances. It is just not possible to have a reliable perception of reality when your brain is in this critical period of development and when you are dependent on bigger humans for much of your reality, even if they’re not as smart as you are. 

If you feel crazy, I’d call that a red flag in itself. Trust your feelings, because they are all you have and all you will ever know. Psychedelic experiences should not make you feel crazy - ‘awakening’ should not a divergence from social constructs or norms, but rather an understanding of them relative to your own stable position."

You will only realise the dangerous split psychedelics are absolutely capable of producing in the developing mind of a particularly curious, introspective individual when it has already happened. And then it is a complex, traumatic ordeal to piece your psyche back together. If I could go back to being 15 with the knowledge I have now, I would use psychedelics maybe a couple times a year, then reevaluate my usage as I got older.

You assume the existence of a creator first and try to find a logical frame for it to occupy second. This sequence itself is illogical. The logical configuration of your argument would be: *If* God exists, it is likely that he comes from a separate realm, a non-physical one, something that is not bound by any laws whatsoever.

We have no scientific evidence that such a lawless realm exists. In fact, that very hypothesis falls outside of our understanding of logic, which is all the understanding we have for the time being. This renders your argument illogical.

I submit not only that starting help (i.e. First Mover. Refer to cosmological argument. It suffers from the same fallacy I referred to above.) *can* be removed from the equation, but that it is inherently problematic to the equation, as any First Mover must itself have been moved. We always run into the problem that the starting help *must* have had some starting help; either that, or at some point in the chain, there must not have been any starting helper. Evidentially, this break in the chain happens before we assume the existence of a God. We can only assert with certainty that the starting help started with the universe itself.

A narcissistic parent will also manipulate other family members against anything they perceive as a threat to them, for example a son who has realised how much his childhood broke him and has thus turned on the narcissist.

It doesn’t sound like he is angry because he feels like everything should be given to him. It sounds like he is angry because the people who were/are supposed to support him haven’t given him enough. Further, they have now actively turned on him. I too would be angry if my family were the kind to call 911 on their own child instead of taking responsibility for their actions. I would feel abandoned and scared and unloved.

adultsurvivors,fly93y7,t3_frwhui,1585597806.0,"I don’t think you can ever know. I suspect I was abused by my father as a baby/toddler yet I cannot remember and don’t see how I’ll ever be able to remember. Maybe I am who I am purely because of genetics and the other abuse I endured. Maybe I was taken advantage of sexually. I will never know and I can do nothing about it. I don’t find myself dwelling on it but I absolutely don’t blame you if you do. I suspect I dwell on it in other abstracted ways, rather than directly, such as my hypersexualized view of reality, or the paralyzing anxiety and fear of this happening to my minor siblings currently. 

I keep myself away from that environment these days to stop the screams. I take drugs, mostly alcohol these days, to keep the above obsessions at bay. I wish I could help them. I wish I could help you. I feel separated. It seems the suspicion and dread will stick around till something lovely and loving fills me up. I am waiting. I wish you the best."
