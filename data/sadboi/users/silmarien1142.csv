Your boyfriend uses your insecurity to belittle you and put you down. Drives like a psycho and risks your life and other drivers lives to be an asshole. 

That's psychotic and abusive and a deal breaker.

relationships,ew067kt,t1_evp8a1b,1564977018.0,"Ugh, had friends like this and it was very toxic all around. When you have money you spend it immediately, so you never budget or spend responsibly. It takes a lot of self control and dealing with not having stuff you really want for months and months before you build up savings, pay bills, and not buying stuff even though you technically have the money is frustrating and disappointing. Some people can't tolerate that feeling. It pays off though. I understand why poor people behave this way. But it's super irresponsible. You gotta grow up and deal if you ever want to be responsible though."
