thebachelor,fqyofs4,t3_glk0hb,1589751908.0,"I’m glad she’s doing this. She’s been spot on. 

A lot of rich white people have a sense about racism that they’re devoid of being capable of such a “low class archaic thing” when in reality racism is prevalent in every class and is not at all exclusive to poor white people, in fact it’s been rightly pointed out that many poor white people dont start out this way who are racist, they work with and live  around people of color and then some privileged politician comes to their neighborhood and scapegoats entire communities and turns them on each other. 

We all need to be willing to admit that not only have we fucked up inexcusably, but that we have to be willing to admit that, feel regret, and follow it up with practical actions continually making amends and doing the right thing. And not acting like any of this is “normal” or some small minor mistake. It’s not. And don’t pretend that just because you’re progressive now that you’re a clean slate.

thebachelor,fqyn2kq,t1_fqymeia,1589751262.0,"That’s entirely valid. I’ve only recently used it sparingly because some bisexual folks in my life have expressed how the word is comforting to them (much of these particular friends I’m speaking about are not out, sometimes I’m the only one who knows or one of very few) so they’ve found it comforting when we are in private. That’s the only reason I’ve used it, personally, because I still feel it’s a double edged sword and I never want to be flippant with that word. 

Personally, I can’t directly comprehend or compare of course, but for me, I’ve come to realize how much misogynistic language I numbed myself to growing up, and now I’m realizing how hurtful it is to me and so many other women. I’ve had to have some hard conversations with men in my life, but many have understand and changed their language. Once I explained it, they understood. 

Truthfully I have very few gay women in my life who are not bisexual, or Pan. So there’s a learning curve for me in terms of experience as well. 

No group is a monolith, and everyone is entitled, especially with a word like that, to their own preferences about it.

thebachelor,fqymemk,t1_fqy87po,1589750954.0,"that’s the anger I feel for and to some extent with the Black  community is I feel like the gaslighting is so prevalent that many of us (white people) don’t even see it because we are so used to acting so horribly. 

Your emotions are valid and no one should get to say otherwise and it’s incredibly baffling that the attitude of so much of the white population is to the contrary. It’s like someone pouring salt into millions of wounds and then blaming the people we wounded in the first place, then just made that wound worse, for having the appropriate reaction - pain. 

A lot of people are straight up scared of Black anger in any form. Which is wild to me because sure, no community is a monolith, but even when I lived in a Black community, aside from a minority of outsiders who did awful things, the people who were the least angry with me and least harmful to me at that time in my life were Black and Brown. It was the abusive white people that they tried to protect me from that said otherwise and called an entire community of mostly kind and loving people “gangsters”."
thebachelor,fqyln7o,t1_fqyhmd0,1589750600.0,"I’ve wondered about this because I know a lot of LGBT+ folks (mostly Bisexual) and most of them feel proud and okay with that word being used both by them and straight people, but I’ve been confused because I grew up thinking that I should never say “queer” because it wasn’t that far off from the f word or d word."
thebachelor,fqylg1y,t1_fqy0r6e,1589750504.0,"It’s definitely true and before I identified as a feminist I was chastised by a white feminist roommate (I’m also white.. not to confuse anyone lol) for not identifying as feminist (another area where I was stupid and wrong lol) yet she and I had fights constantly about BLM because at that point I had come to actively support that movement, and she felt the opposite. 

I can’t help but reflect now and see how indicative that situation is of the racism within every wave of feminism.  And trans Black women in particular probably face some of the worst exclusion in these circles. 

It makes no logical sense at this point, her position, nor mine, at that time. Both her and I have come around on both issues but the way she was so deeply adamant about it not being right and yet felt it had nothing to do with feminism still bothers me."
thebachelor,fqykzha,t1_fqxx8t5,1589750295.0,"(Not a defense at all just reflecting on my own wrongness and ignorance) 

I’ve never felt okay using homophobic or racist slurs, but I didn’t realize that even when in a car with one friend, a white friend, singing along to rap, I sometimes said the n word without the hard are around him and felt extremely stupid and shitty when I realized I did that sometimes in my preteen years. Part of it was that I realized I didn’t know why I was even saying it and wouldn’t say it outside of that even without the hard r, and I wouldn’t even sing it around anyone else especially not Black friends of mine so it became stupid and illogical. If I won’t say it around anyone else, especially not my Black friends, why sing it at all? I think a lot of white people like myself didn’t realize that even in the context of me being a child and alone with one white friend and not using the hard r and only singing it occasionally, that’s still insanely stupid and fucked up. And you’re absolutely right, I never did the same thing with any homophobic slurs which is a kind of cognitive dissonance a lot of white people are unwilling to admit they’ve ever had. 

It sounds stupid but even though I stopped long before I saw this, the scene in Dear White People right before the big fight where the frat boy is singing along and says the n word, that’s what made me fully realize just how harmful even what I did could be. And I needed to realize it more deeply, and feel an appropriate amount of shame and humility and regret, and continue to try to change and make up for what I did. 

What I don’t understand is, why all the immediate excuses for our (white people’s) bad behavior? Especially using racist slurs. Context doesn’t excuse a damn thing, and I feel like that’s something we all should know as adults at the VERY least, but I hope children are learning this as well, because I certainly was not taught it. Quite the opposite, I was around a lot of overtly racist relatives. 


It’s not the exact same, but it reminds me a bit of the phenomenon of the “myth of a just world” around rape culture where people couldnt POSSIBLY believe someone they know or someone at all would do that to someone else, so they search for rationalizations and excuses for the aggressor and blame and gaslighting for the victims. Seems to me that the Black community has experienced hundreds of years of this sort of behavior and worse, on a nationwide and global scale. 

We (white people) are very quick to excuse the unexcuseable, and gaslight Black people for extremely valid emotions and reactions in response to that word being used by non Black people, because for one, a lot of us are racially biased, and for two, we’d rather believe someone accidentally did harm and excuse it accordingly than hear the rightful anger and hurt Black people have in response because it would logically lead to us feeling empathy and hopefully reflecting on our own bad actions and how we have contributed to the problem in one way or many ways. 

As a white woman, I’ve noticed that white women, especially thin, well-off, generally seen as attractive, women, are given sometimes even more of a pass than anyone else for this kind of racist behavior. It’s the poor, feeble, helpless white princess who needs to be defended because she ~ wouldn’t hurt a soul ~ and her tears are made into weapons against an entire community of oppressed people. 

Amber Guyger and Hannah are not the same, but I think people do not realize that they have overlap, and we all need to confront that reality in each other and ourselves and do whatever we can to right our wrongs and make the lives of the people we have passively or directly harmed better, however we can, with the privilege we have. 

All of this is to say, I’ve fucked up, and I deserved to feel like shit for it. My age at the time or the context is not an excuse. I bristled at my friends, during those same years, who were Brown or White, calling me the n word in a friendly way, because I knew they shouldn’t be. I knew my relatives were wrong. And I still messed up and was stupid and contributed to the problem, and for that I deserved to feel not white guilt, but appropriate shame. Some behaviors we should feel ashamed about. But if we stop there, those feelings don’t help all that much of course. 

My frustration is that I’ve noticed a lot of Black men in my life and in the public eye who are willing to defend things like what Hannah did. Obviously this is not ALL Black men, it’s probably a small, but in my experience, very vocal group that is for whatever reason invested in defending the bad actions of usually white women. 

Hannah needs the brunt of the confrontation here, but the white people who have done things like this, and the white and some Black people who have possibly passively or directly enabled her behavior need to take a look at themselves I hope as well.

Compatability  can include ethnic or racial background and culture and religion of course but it is not the whole picture.

thebachelor,floy31q,t3_fnmj76,1585347826.0,"My family has a lot of interracial marriages, children, and relationships in it. Heck even the fact that my grandparents were different types of White was scandalous back when they got married (legit forced my grandpa to convert from Catholicism to Lutheranism) but not nearly as severe as the backlash to my sister, aunt, and great uncle who married or are engaged to Latinx people and Black people. 

My thing is that I’ve noticed, plenty of people I know including one of the relatives I mentioned here, can date outside of their race and still hold onto subconscious biases. My aunt’s husband was literally called “the dark one” by my great grandma and I got hell for him being my favorite uncle from people at school who somehow didn’t understand that my pale ass had a very dark skinned uncle by marriage and loved him. He was my hero as a kid. And I Never understood why people were so strange to me about it until I got older (naïveté bound in white privilege). My aunt says she’s “colorblind” a lot.. and while I know she loves my uncle, the tone of her comments comes off really performative and biased when you follow her train of thought. 

My concern for my friends and my nieces who are people of color is that many people can love outside of their race, of course! Many can be attracted to other races, and still hold biases that are dangerous. So the trepidation many of my loved ones feel about interracial dating, while at first it didn’t make sense to me and my ego felt stupidly bruised by it for no good reason, listening to Black women who I got to know well through different friendships and campus activism and seeing the debates they had between them and Black men that confused the hell out of me at first, while I don’t fully understand, I see why they’re frustrated. I see why WOC on the show are hurt. 

It seems like the only way for WOC to get screen time is to be painted as dramatic, “aggressive”, or occasionally hyper sexualized. Much of the time it seems production keeps them as cyphers to move the plot forward, or background objects instead of people.

Honestly I’ve never been attracted to a “type” and was involved with Latinx guys a lot growing up because my town has a lot of Latinx folks here. People have preferences, yes, but for me, even when I was far less progressive and in many ways a shittier person, I’ve never had a “type”. Even within whiteness, yeah I’m typically less attracted to super pale blonde hair blue eyed dudes because they look too much like me lol but it still happens. It’s more about proximity and personality for me. Sure I see color, everyone does. But usually I just see how beautiful the person is by getting to know them. And race and culture only add to the attraction potentially. 

Friends I have who have a bound and set “type” in terms of race are often times that way because of fetishes that are not healthy or respectful, or because of shared culture and life experiences. A “friend” of mine is white/Latinx and says she has “yellow fever” and dated my Vietnamese ex boyfriend mostly because he was Asian and was weirdly congratulatory towards me when she found out I’ve dated/been involved with  many kinds of men. It’s not an achievement or a virtue. My horribly racist relative loves to bring up his Korean ex girlfriend. 

Anyways, I know you mainly wanted WOC to speak on this so apologies if this wasn’t appropriate. I just have seen a lot of my fellow pale ladies attack women of color for questions like yours and for many of them being wary of white women who only date Black men or other men of color or other similar issues and I just wanted to say, from someone who was stupid about this issue in the past, that those women lacking understanding and empathy for you is really fucked up and unfair - obviously. And your feelings are valid regardless of what any white person - myself included - has to say about them. I can only imagine how emotionally exhausting dating as a woman of color must be. I want my nieces to grow up knowing that I support them no matter what, and that means supporting women of color."

Even on this show. And even when they get shit for it it’s still a. Not as harsh as when it’s a woman and b. Bound in the idea that men are inherently more sexual than women and thus are mindless sex robots practically who can’t be held to the same standard as women because men are “cursed” with horniness and think with their dicks (which I find to be unfair towards men!)

Yeah a bachelor would be treated differently but shunned? Not sure about that honestly. Some would be harsh on them because of the way people see men as horny animals who are born to be irresponsible and more sexual than women, but some would be harsh on them because men making crude comments sometimes comes from a worse place. Women have been objectified for centuries by men and many men have a habit of reducing women down to solely sexual beings for their pleasure to this day. So it does carry a burden with it. I think men should be allowed to be sexual and open about it, even make jokes of course. But many times those jokes and their sex lives may reveal underlying darkness in how they view and treat women. 

But the windmill joke I think plays fine either way. I don’t see it as being objectifying at all and I doubt if a man said it it would be taken badly. 

Hannah’s comment was taken as a joke and taken well by a lot of people - true. But those who didn’t were loud and horrific. While Pete is given much more permission to be sexual and complicated by a lot of people, she was hated for being sexual and complicated."

There’s also this erasure of the fact that Babs spoke for the whole family - both of the other men in that household (other than peter) felt literally the same way but don’t have the same emotional displays.

Yet no one was bothered by Madison? Who interrupted Babs MULTIPLE times and had a snobby attitude much of the show but especially toward barb and the family? And even toward peter?!

I agree with all of your points for sure. Madi is a social climber whose branded herself with a Jesus / Virgin sign on her. She stepped on everyone in her path and had no care for them. 

Also you brought up a thought for me :

I have seen people reading into and lambasting the Weber’s (ESPECIALLY Babs) since HB’s season for being supportive of their son having an autonomous, adult sex life. Yet mostly, ~ crickets ~ from these people about the fact that Madi’s family seemed (especially her father) absolutely obsessed with her “purity” remaining in tact. And that doesn’t bother them? Talk about a bias...

To use a biblical phrase, Madi comes across to me as a wolf in sheep’s clothing. (But that sheep is now REVOLVE) .

She absolutely tried to shame peter for having sex which is exactly what Luke P did. While he is worse in some areas Madi is worse in others : one being that she is calculated. Every move seems pre planned. Luke is such a vile piece of crap that he couldn’t plan his villainy it just happened"

Hey I’m 23 too and I totally track with you especially with anxiety and ADHD. I don’t want to demonize anyone here. I was off put by Madi more than once this season for several reasons, but I also don’t see things as being black and white. Especially on a show like this. I feel for both of these women to a point"

I’m a psychology student and mental health worker so I’m always curious on how different people react to different things. Believe it or not, one of my first undergrad Psych professors watches the BN shows for this reason and she’s part of the reason I do too. She finds it fascinating in what it says about human behavior. 

I think her presentation is why she has gotten a thousand times more heat than Jim & Jack have, and maybe a dash of sexism for some viewers."

thebachelor,fkdfxhn,t1_fkd6pfy,1584077351.0,"Hard agree. I’m kind of a lapsed(?) Christian and talking to my much more sexually active than me Christian friend I met at a Christian school ( a girl who is typically not conservative in a lot of ways ) legit wanted to argue very heatedly with me about Madi because I dared to say I found her problematic. She has convinced so many people she is “pure” because she’s a Virgin (toxic take) but also that (and I absolutely hate this but it’s so common in the church) she is a “better Christian” for being abstinent/a Virgin. I just don’t get it. I’m abstinent for non-religious reasons and my partner is abstinent for religious reasons mainly and I still don’t understand how she’s getting a pass here. Her sense of moral superiority is just awful and it’s part of a larger harmful culture yet to be meaningfully addressed in this arena. 

I never have had the thought that sexually active people are somehow less “pure” or less “Christian” than me (for a lot of personal reasons but also because why the hell would I???).

My take is : if she didn’t constantly speak Christianese and brand herself a the “Christian virgin girl” no one in the church would be defending her this hard. If at all."

She comes from an echo chamber it seems and does not seem to see that as an issue but instead sees it as an affirmation of her inherent “right”-ness. Honestly she has shown some pretty consistent arrogance this season, intentional or not. With the other girls, with Peter, and now with peters family. It’s really sad to watch people excuse her for all of her choices and lambaste everyone else. 

Also I just don’t get it. I don’t get what’s do “great” about her. I don’t hate the girl, but I don’t get being a super fan either, since she didn’t show anything all that interesting or exciting or unique. But hey I hope I’m wrong. I was wrong about Hannah Ann .. kinda lol."

She always re-routes things back to HERSELF. And has zero perspective on how she has negatively impacted other people. She is no friend of Hannah Ann’s."
thebachelor,fk8dn75,t3_ffvr1v,1583954104.0,"Does anyone else feel 
Extremely conflicted about Barbara and Jim (Peter Sr.) tonight? 

Personally, I’m in my first serious long term relationship with a guy who, in beliefs , is in some ways very much like Madison.  

In short, my family is not a safe and functional family, so him and I agreed that they should not meet him or have access to our relationship. 

But his family is very much like peters in some ways. He actually noticed this himself even on Hannah browns season. His dad is the often quiet type who hates conflict but still has strong opinions when something he cares about comes up. His mom is extremely strong in expressing her emotions and opinions and can be really invasive and overbearing. At times she has been a massive issue in our relationship and I have to constantly monitor myself to avoid hurting her feelings. Her and her husbands opinions on me and on my relationship have at times been an issue. Largely we gel mostly well, but in the past I was blamed for a lot of changes in my boyfriend that have more to do with him growing up than anyone influencing him. 

I feel conflicted because I found myself empathizing with both Barb and Madison. It waxed and waned for each of them, and wasnt 50/50 necessarily. But it was there and confusing.

Because on the one hand, of what Babs said is true, it’s totally understandable why they would struggle here. I also resent this idea that his parents should just “fall in line” for producers and an audience when this is their child. Parents who are overly involved are scary to me to be honest but I’m trying to express that I have empathy for SOME of their predicament here. 

Barbara and Jim (Peter sr) shouldn’t have to lie for cameras and smoothness. But they also shouldn’t demand so much say. However, the things she said seem very true and Jim seemed genuinely concerned. I have to say that’s worth considering here.  That family’s homeostasis is extremely strange to be but because of my family background I struggle evaluating it outside of cursory psychology knowledge I have and experiences I’ve had. Their homeostasis is being very involved. Their homeostasis is their son having them involved in his whole life including romance wise and him living with them doesn’t help. 

But at the same time, he is an adult and should be allowed to make his own decisions. They are entitled to their perspective and feelings and I personally understand where they are coming from and see some of it as valid whether or not i enjoyed how it came out. I got the impression that Madi was not trying very hard with them and was not very warm BUT... at the same time, my ADHD, PTSD and other health issues made my partners family think I wasn’t trying as well. And they also had unfairly High silent demands of me that were leveled against me at times. 

Madi doesn’t need to go back on her beliefs. She doesn’t seem to have perspective here though that she made mistakes too. And her interrupting barb (twice now) and not actually answering to the accusations she made and continually not trying to even address her directly and even seeming to use Peter as a shield rubbed me the wrong way too. But I still feel for her. I know if I were in her shoes (because in some ways, I have been) I would struggle a lot and likely not be at my best. I want to believe that’s the case here, that she is overwhelmed and possibly anxious and doesn’t have leeway to take her time and consider it the way she should be allowed to. 

But peter and Madison pretending that nothing his parents said is important is not going to help anything between the couple nor the parents. 

Personally I think production took a bit of advantage here and crossed the line more than once. They saw barb and Jim struggling and saw an opportunity to milk that for entertainment. 

Madi shouldn’t be piled on even if it’s not intended to be that way. Barb and Jim shouldn’t be villainized even if their methods were ... not great (to put it mildly). 

Ultimately this tension will only cause more issues for all of them. I’ve been there. And I had to compromise more than I should have. But at least we have a stable functional relationship between the family and I and communicate far better now, and this improved me and my partners relationship as well. 

I hope peter and Madison are happy. But being happy doesn’t erase differences this huge. I’ve tried that. It never ever works. Especially with religion and family tied in and lifestyle differences. 

Peter shouldn’t have to live in shame for having sexual relationships. Madi shouldn’t have to live in shame for what she has done either. It seems like they expect the in laws and all their issues and differences to evaporate because of love. And it’s just not realistic. I wish I saw a more hopeful situation here but Jim was right - how a relationship begins is indicative of how it will end. 

His actions with Hannah Ann absolutely made this relationship even less likely to last. 

I don’t understand the unwavering optimism here and the need to pick a side. Absolutely no ones hands are clean here other than probably Hannah Ann tbh. Madi is not a pure and innocent perfect girl, and Peter is not just a puppy of a man hoping for love, and his family is not just being stubborn villains who should be hated for being a “hurdle” to their overly optimistic happiness about a relationship that likely will not last. 

Peter likes hard relationships. He likes the chase. And if he was honest with himself, his romantic life is riddled with examples of him bending over backwards to be the martyr for a doomed relationship  and he thinks he has to compromise 24/7. No one should love this way, or live this way."
