Shamanism,fn3d8u3,t1_fn3254a,1586618326.0,She is local but she studies under the Andien shamans for years before coming back to America. I was lucky finding her. She's the one who took me through my aya ceremony too.
Shamanism,fn2fh70,t1_fn2cvdy,1586587164.0,Thank you! I'm really loving it more than any other platform already. 😄
Shamanism,fn2few3,t1_fn12p1n,1586587100.0,This is amazing! 😍 I have only sat with Aya once and I felt like I went through the pain of the entire collective feminine from thousands of years of abuse and suppression. It was INTENSE!
Shamanism,fn2f7dd,t1_fn285cm,1586586899.0,Whoa!!! This is freaking WILD! 😳😃 Were you nervous? I've done shrooms and 4 aco which is basically just shrooms but only mild doses. Is this how big doses normally go? Like seeing and speaking with entities? 😲
Shamanism,fn2e6ii,t1_fn10wv9,1586585908.0,"No! You're totally good! It's so nice to connect with you and I never get the chance to talk about this stuff and I still keep this side of myself hidden from those around me so it is actually super nice to connect with others on this journey! 🤗🥰 

I've been journeying with a shaman and solo for about a year and a half now. It's one of my favorite practices and a deep part of my personal pathwork. For this specific journey, I was assisted by a shaman and there was drumming for the whole of it. When I journey solo, I have to use a drumming track but it's never quite the same as the way real drumming reverberates through you and assist in taking you deeper. ♥️ The journey above was sober but I've had journeys on shrooms before. I'm as always a little cautious so usually about 2.5 grams. 5 meo dmt, I've done twice now and it almost immediately and completely dissolves the ego. You can't actually hold a conscious thought at all. You're just one with everything but there is no thought and there is no you. You dissolve and all that is left is love. Like the biggest most beautiful unimaginable PURE LOVE. 😍 It's my favorite experience I've ever had. I lost my best friend,  my grandma (who was like my deepest soul companion and fellow black sheep of the family) and my grandpa all in the course of 3 months. I went into the deepest depression of my life, I also had constant existential dread and a total faith crisis, I had honestly lost all will to live. 5 meo saved my life and healed my fear of death and helped me to finally let go of that deep pain from losing the people I loved because I experienced a sort of death and rebirth and I knew the other side was beautiful and the other side was pure love! The hard part is actually wanting to come back into your body. 😄 It's entirely changed my life though. I was so fearful before and now I live in a deep state of love and surrender 💗"
Shamanism,fn2cvah,t1_fn0zq60,1586584673.0,"Of course! I'd be happy to share! This conversation with you today was actually super nourishing and inspiring for me and I decided to connect more deeply with the godess so I looked up more information about her and created an alter and invoked her through journeying and had a huge emotional release. The inspiration from your shared journey, made me want to try embodying the energy she brings. She is so powerful and FIERCE! 😍🔥 I am timid and shy so it was fucking spectacular!

I am new to reddit so I hope I did that right. 😅 I don't see them physically with my eyes open but I feel them in the space around me and when I close my eyes and tap into my mind's eye, I can interact with them. I have like a weird path though lol. It's like a shaman psychedelic shakti tantric path. 😂 Everyone's path is so beautiful and unique though. I'd love to hear more about yours! 😍 I've been shamanic journeying at least once a week for a year and a half and the journeying process assist in peeling back so many layers and opens you to new dimensions so that's what creates the really strong connection with guides for me. It's different for everyone. Do you have experience with journeying? 

If you want to know more about the dark Goddess pathwork, I really think this video is lovely and informative as to why someone might want to explore that aspect of themselves. This gets a little more into the Shakti tantra realm but this is like my current practice till I'm called to something else. For a while, I was connecting mostly with Mary Magdalene and the womb priestess path but it's recently been shifting toward Kali which fits in with the throat chakra so perfectly. 💗

Shamanism,fn0qch1,t3_fyk8r2,1586546736.0,"This is incredible to read! Thank you for sharing! 💗🙏 I felt activations just reading it! 

I haven't had an experience quite like this but I had a shamanic journey once where I was entirely taken apart and then I was reassembled by a team of guides. When I was taken apart, I was consciousness floating above my body as I watched myself being resembled on a large marble slab. They healed me and  fused my body parts back together upgraded, they activated new systems and strands of DNA. They upgraded my chakras and super charged my kundilini. They began the healing process of my autoimmune condition and said it would be complete when I could completely believe. They planted a golden seed in my solar plexus. I remember going through a cleansing of fire and a cleansing of water. There were so many symbolic things happening that it's hard to recall everything and I'm still unpacking it nearly a year later. I have it written in a journal somewhere. I should try to locate it. After this though, I started to have a very intense kundilini awakening that's still taking place. The last year has been full of pain and loss but it's broken through several of my chakras. The heart and solar plexus were the ones that were the most emotionally painful but I also started having very obvious assistance from my guides at this time. Like you explain. It's a deep deep knowing. I started to see them around me when I would be doing the work. What's crazy is my dog would see them too because he would stare right at the spots where I could sense them. It was surreal. I'm now in the throat chakra. That one is challenging for me because through a series of traumas, I experienced voicelessness but my throat has become activated again and now that my solar plexus has healed, I'm no longer afraid. Shrooms and 5 meo dmt were crucial in this process. 🙏 I believe in synchronicity and it's funny because my guides have clearly shown me the kundilini is working through my throat chakra now and yesterday I happened upon a video about Kali Ma and it explained that when kundilini reaches the throat chakra, Kali Ma slays the ego so we can transcend and stop playing small and remember we are one with love and source. I thought it was interesting, your experience seemed very throat chakra related too. 😍 When I heard that though, I for full body chills because I could feel the truth of it deep in my body."

forkingpaths,fme4u3s,t1_fmd8p0l,1585989392.0,"No seriously, it's beautiful. I'm glad my mind got to be expanded by reading this! ☺ It's like brain candy. This theory in particular is maybe extra awesome for me too because I'm super into spirituality and tantra which has a lot to do with the masculine and feminine principles and inner marriage and integration of all the wounded parts of self back into one healed whole. 💗 I mean, I guess that's part of why I'm obsessed with the OA in general. I relate to the character, especially the first season. Going through deep trauma and feeling imprisoned by it and then feeling sort of saved by finding new dimensions within."

Tantra,flkt86x,t3_fp5yoa,1585247243.0,"Yeah I've read Urban tantra and Tantra Illuminated. I would say Urban tantra is mostly about tantric sex and kinks but if you're self educating with this, it may give you a skewed perspective of tantra. With true tantra, sex is only one piece. Basically tantra is life and the ""weaving together"" so since it encompasses all of life, it includes sex and sexual energy as a path to ecstatic states of bliss and enlightenment and deeper embodiment. I would say balance this with the book Tantra Illuminated. The thing is though, tantra is a technology and it is experiential in nature. The experiences take you down a path of deep self love, self expression and polarity play, it retrains the nervous system and I personally believe it's the best path of spirituality because it helps us to become more embodied and not less like most paths. I would say because of the experiential nature, find a local teacher, ask some questions to make sure you vibe and go to a workshop. I'm going to be teaching workshops myself soon. ☺💗"
ptsd,fl019kw,t3_flehpd,1584687483.0,I'm so so sorry you went through that. I wanted to see it but I'm grateful I saw a review that spoke of this exact scene and even the description made me feel sick all day so I knew not to see it. Life is so different after PTSD. I am very careful about the content I consume because it's so easy to end up mentally harmed.

ptsd,fkz2d3u,t1_fkxyvwa,1584661244.0,Ah! I love this! We're on the same wavelength! I love that book and Peter Level and the Holistic psychologist is incredible. I watch all her videos.  So healing. Check out Irene Lyon on YouTube too. I think you'll like her.
sex,fiv9wdc,t1_fitw2yv,1582756588.0,Yeah I'd say shifting the blame to her is just about the LEAST tantric thing he could ever do. Tantra is all about being within your integrity. He probably has more integration to do.
DMT,fiaohj0,t1_fi9qpgq,1582305263.0,I've had 5 meo dmt it's not very visual but it was life changing.
DMT,fi8wm4m,t3_f7359i,1582250042.0,Wow 😍 I've been really wanting experience DMT but just seeing this makes me feel so much. I audibly gasped when I opened this and saw this picture 🤩
5MeODMT,fho8uhm,t1_fhl8hmt,1581745581.0,I completely agree with this 👆
5MeODMT,fho85ux,t1_fhl7p5d,1581744835.0,"No, don't worry about it. If you are worried about it, just do a ceremony tonight with the intention to call back in and retrieve any energy you've left in other places or with other people. I do that before journeying and it helps me so much. 🙏 Most importantly, don't stress! It's gonna be great. 💗"
5MeODMT,fhntnat,t1_fhk2sal,1581732530.0,"I agree with you and the other commenters under your comment but I think it has to do with energy exchange. Like I'm very water energy and my partner is VERY fire energy. When we're intimate, I take on some of that. I find myself a lot more easily heated and angry. With that said, I also practice tantra and believe when two partners are open and emotionally purify themselves before intimacy and create sacred space, deep transformation and healing can also be achieved through sex."
DMT,fh87qc1,t3_f1dikg,1581353869.0,"Woe this is the meanest comment thread I've ever read for something so harmless. I don't get the point in being so rude. It's seriously a harmless, cool connection someone put together that affects none of your lives in any harmful way. This isn't a serious issue. Y'all just wanted to crush someone for putting themselves out there."
DMT,fgptlcc,t1_fgpfw9y,1581011748.0,This is what I was going to say. I've been an emotional wreck the last six months because I've lost so many people I love in a really short window and I'm not religious so I didn't have that comfort that a lot of people have from their beliefs about the afterlife. I also had near constant existential dread. I smoked 5-meO last week and my entire perception has shifted. I am no longer afraid of death. It feels like it's only a transition and what's on the other side is pure love. Using that term just sounds silly but there are actually no words for the experience.
5MeODMT,fgpic9d,t3_ezt1l5,1581005372.0,"I just had my first experience a week ago. Completely life changing. Just come in with reverence and be prepared to go through a death process. You will feel like you're dying but it's only the ego dying. One of the women who helped facilitate me told me was a midwife and she said think of it as your rebirth. When you're first born and you're comfortable and the womb is all you've known, then labor starts and you start to travel down the birth canal and it's dark and can feel a little scary and there's pressure but just remember that's all it is. You're about to be born. It honestly helped me so unbelievably much to surrender to the experience. If you have any questions as it approaches, feel free to ask. It's still so fresh for me so I'm happy to be a resource"

sex,fdhta17,t3_elap7e,1578429759.0,"If you find a partner who is willing to take it really reeeaaally slowly with you, it won't hurt. I was really lucky in that way. My husband took so much time. It was probably a few weeks of him just taking his time barely entering and warming me up with long sessions of cunnilingus and multiple orgasms before even trying to enter. If he can understand it doesn't have to be all at once, I feel like it doesn't have to hurt."

sex,f85q6dy,t1_f85cspq,1574280649.0,"This seems like a sad answer to me. Actually counseling can indeed help. Sex for women isn't just about libido. Our emotions ate our sex are interwoven. When I'm having issues in my life, it 100% affects my sex drive. Women are good at keeping fifty plates spinning but the more stress load we have the less we cab let our bodies relax and get out of our headspace and into sexual surrender. Like we can't let go of all the stress and check lists so that we can be present with our sexual bodies. ESPECIALLY after having a child"

Every second of it is worth it even if we never get more and honestly, you'll want to watch each season more than once. I'm actually grateful there was 2 years in between season 1 and 2 because I would have just binged one and then straight into two but I think season 1 stands alone and deserves to be savored by itself. I watched it 8 times and every single time, I peeled back deeper layers and with every rewatch it healed me a little deeper and taught me. It's a show that is an entirely immersive experience. You want to fall into it's world and let the current carry you away. Watch it. 💗"
