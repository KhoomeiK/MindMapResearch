depression,fj7te2r,t3_fblia5,1583097892.0,How did you see a professional? I am 15 and I think I might have depression but I really dont want to seem like I fake having depression or are just overdramatic so I dont tell anyone and I kinda just put it down as being sad. I think that's what it might be but maybe I need to hear from a professional.
depression,fj7sxwj,t3_fbra42,1583097612.0,Yes! That's why I'm stuck in this cycle where I dont want to be alone with myself so I try to insert myself in everything my friends are doing but it makes me seem annoying so they hang out with me less and so I try to hang out more with them etc.
depression,fj7sonc,t3_fbtpus,1583097450.0,"For real. I see a girl I like in the halls and I start saying stuff to myself like ""you're such a pussy for not asking her out"", ""she would never like you"" and ""you are going to be alone forever""  and then I'm all bummed out for like an hour or two"
depression,fj7sfgd,t1_fiaa1y5,1583097289.0,My problem is I cant tell if its depression or not because I get sad about something real or something I made up in my head and it just lingers around me for a while so when I end up feeling better it's only for a little. Life's like 50/50 of feeling sad and happy and I remember life not being like that.
TooAfraidToAsk,fictsun,t1_ficsd89,1582356631.0,"Thank you so much for your effort and concern in helping me. I really appreciate it :) 
I'll definently consider talking to my step mom, I think I'll be ok for now. Today was just especially hard because I was planning on asking my crush out and was all excited but then I saw her hanging out with a big friend group which is something that I dont have, hence the feeling of being a burden for asking her out. I think I'll get over it and ask her out next Thursday or Friday"
TooAfraidToAsk,fict5li,t1_ficm8b9,1582356330.0,Thanks for the insight. Yea my school does have counsellors but my counselor happens to be my step mom so it would be pretty hard for me
TooAfraidToAsk,ficsv7a,t1_fico8na,1582356015.0,Oh thanks I'm better now
TooAfraidToAsk,ficm11k,t1_ficltep,1582351686.0,Yes
TooAfraidToAsk,ficl9qo,t1_ficka0n,1582350902.0,"Sounds like a good idea but I dont know how I'd do that. Like would I go to my step mom and be like ""I think I have depression can you send me to a different counselor?""
btw I also know all the other counselors too cause they're my step mom's friends"
TooAfraidToAsk,fickn2o,t1_ficj2av,1582350273.0,"Yea I hear that a bit. My problem isnt really with my current issues but the fact that I caused them. Like I dont want to ask out my crush because I feel like I'm pretty bad in social situations, but I think it will only get worse out of high school if I dont get better. 
And to quote an earlier comment, ""Well uh my mom married my step mom who happens to be a school counselor, at my school, and she so happens to be the counselor for my last name. So I'd be asking my step mom to file out a depression form.""

Thanks for your response :)"
TooAfraidToAsk,fickdh0,t1_ficjba7,1582350011.0,"To copy and past what I commented earlier, ""Well uh my mom married my step mom who happens to be a school counselor, at my school, and she so happens to be the counselor for my last name. So I'd be asking my step mom to file out a depression form.
And yea I get that logic with asking my crush out, that's what I was going with, but I'm afraid that she will say yes. I feel like I'm not worth her time. She would probably be too sweet to turn me down or she'd keep going out with me even if she didnt enjoy it."" 
I'm fine with the rejection. It makes me feel excitement that I haven't felt for a while just to think about asking her out. 

Theres several things that get me down, but I feel like they are too insignificant to get worked up about. (I'm not as good at saxophone as I'd like to be but I just lose the motivation that I used to have when I first got it, my grades are getting slightly worse, I'm short, I feel like I'm a boring person, I'm skinny, etc.)

The only other major problem I have is that I dont live with my biological mom who I think is depressed. I found out recently that she had been lying about having a job, and she is just so sweet to me and pretends like everything is fine and it breaks my heart.

And thank you so much for the support :)"
