Don‚Äôt tell them ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a phase‚Äù it gave my depression fuel to continue
People in that situation really appreciate small acts and things, my friend really helped me by listening and being supportive ( it helps a lot because it gives you a motivation to not die due to a person liking you and appreciating your presence) 
Be there for them, as I said smallest things make the difference. 
Keep them away from sources of committing suicide or self harm, like high places that you can jump, razors, knives, bleach, you name it.( in my case keeping me away from knives wasn‚Äôt good because I love cooking and they took one of the hobbies that I really appreciate in the misery I was in. It was miserable, instead, supervise them.)
Even though they might have overcome depression already, it still hurts them in a couple of weeks like, I wasn‚Äôt suicidal anymore, still made me think if it was worth living. 
If possible keep them away from listening to music that‚Äôs too depressing, it will give more fuel to their depression, but it helped me to see that I‚Äôve become that crap (also seeing people with ‚Äúbattle wounds‚Äù made me realize what I was dealing with) and snap out of it, only a lot of time later, in the beginning made me feel like absolute shit. It can also be really risky.

We started tearing apart, he was making it that way, and I was realizing that was about to loose my best friend, me being me, was very sad. We were supposed to have our anniversary of friendship ( call it however you want ) of 10 years."

AskReddit,eryxbte,t3_c4w691,1561419972.0,"I remember that I went to the U.S when I was 8 years old only to visit, little me hasn‚Äôt learned English yet, and in my country taxes are applied in the product so I had exact change, when the money was more than I thought I was in shock, starting to sob. An old lady paid the tax for me and I thanked her with the little English.
If you‚Äôre wondering what an 8 year old was doing in a store alone, I wanted to be independent and buy something for my mom. It was cute."
