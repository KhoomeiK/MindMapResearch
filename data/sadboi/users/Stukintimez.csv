Well my last girlfreind liked quickies, in fact she didn't mind skipping foreplay, i really liked that about her, but was wondering if it's a rare thing, ialways thought that it would ""hurt"" as many times she was pretty dry when i started humping her.

I remember hooking up with a girl and i had to stop because she was ""dry"".

So i wanted to know if it's common or not. Doesn't it hurt ?"
