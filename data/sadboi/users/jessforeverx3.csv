I shop from cruelty free brands who are owned by a non-cf parent company. I read love, beauty and planet isn't really cf. I don't remember where I read this but I saw it when I did my own researching. If you see a small business that you're interested in and it's very clear they don't test on animals, I consider that to be ok as well. And yes, there are a lot of cf products that are pricey. However, there a ton of brands that are pretty affordable. ELF, Colourpop, Milani, Dr. Bronner's soap, Hello (dental hygiene brand), Seventh Generation (if they're still cf).

And I say this to my best friend, if there's somehow no way you can have something be cruelty free, whether for financial reasons or cruelty free options don't work for you, don't beat yourself up over it. I have to use a deodorant from Secret because I haven't found something that works for me. I had to buy Tresemme conditioner because I ran out of my cruelty free one and my local Target didn't carry any options for me."
