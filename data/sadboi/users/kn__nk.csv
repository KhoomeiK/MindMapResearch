LoveNikki,fqtkgtj,t3_gkdcy9,1589640760.0,I didnt expect this to be back at all bruhhhhhhhh I have no dias left
LoveNikki,fqpjkbq,t3_gjyshz,1589547925.0,Tbh I just regret almost every early suit I spent dias on when I started playing a few years ago. I was a V0 at the time but I fell in love with so much so quickly only to never use them again.
LoveNikki,fqpj5ea,t3_gjpu3a,1589547652.0,Come on talent!
LoveNikki,fqpiz9c,t3_gk653i,1589547541.0,The discipline...truly admirable no joke

LoveNikki,fqlm6gj,t1_fqixkdb,1589461509.0,"To add to this, the only stories I read thess days are the side stories they do for events etc. Aside from chapter 15 which was very hyped up I end up skipping through most of the main story. I feel like there's a lot of potential  totally wasted. The side stories range from surprisingly good to intriguing but the main story....? Not as much."

LoveNikki,fqllacd,t3_gj9665,1589460925.0,"It's like the moment you want to craft something the drops are nonexistent. If I go directly from Evolution for example, I wont get the drops I need. But if I go directly to the stage I will magically get drops. The system feels rigged sometimes lol."
LoveNikki,fqlke1r,t3_gj5yto,1589460332.0,"The best advice is to just get out and look for a better one. As many others have said, I was in that same situation to the point where sometimes only I was active. I left and found a better association  and things are much improved. 

Communicate, be active, and make an effort. My association has a discord so that helps with keeping everyone on the same page."

LoveNikki,fpxxkpi,t1_fppe93b,1588991650.0,Ugh ALL my early days playing and wasting precious resources makes me mad at myself. I want to go back in time and take my phone away.

rupaulsdragrace,fprcq29,t3_get9ok,1588850371.0,I found it ironic and eventually could laugh about it during my last rewatch. Rolaskatox rolaskatoxed. She was So ScArEd of repeating the same mistakes and then proceeded to do just that. It was peak reality tv to be sure. AS2 is a forever favorite.
LoveNikki,fppmtlp,t3_geoda1,1588805204.0,Tbh I love the comedy in the main sub and I'm alright with fan art too. A starry corridor sub sounds like a good idea though

rupaulsdragrace,fpemhay,t1_fpejcyd,1588550404.0,"See I understand  this point of view. I love alternative  and new and different and odd _anything_ but I also see so much value in her skill and execution. 

In the past, on the show, alternative style queens have won over more traditional ones (Sharon, Aquaria, Sasha, Evie) because they brought something different to the table. BUT I feel like the narrative around them is always ""pageant is boring and lame and too stiff we want something else"" straight up trashing the competition in question. The moment a queen is put in a pageant box perfection is not enough. 

I would like for the show (and a some fans)to give some more respect to different styles of drag instead of telling them to be ""fishier"" (I'm looking at you Michelle) but I won't fault Jaida and queens like her for that. 

Jaida is not always reinventing the wheel but a fair amount of what she brings is interesting and different anyway. I just feel it's being discounted."
rupaulsdragrace,fpek9la,t1_fpejmiq,1588549172.0,Me too. I want to see them at the very end
rupaulsdragrace,fpek20e,t1_fpei3we,1588549056.0,"I agree that there's nothing wrong with preferring one over the other. However there is something wrong with trashing one in order to uplift the other. Like a person can say ""I love alternative drag"" and not even mention pageant drag or go on to say it's boring etc etc."
rupaulsdragrace,fpegv4t,t1_fpegiy7,1588547294.0,Exactly. She's  given us how many gowns....? Not more than three.

LoveNikki,fowqbbz,t3_g9vdaz,1588124910.0,"I try to always use poc skin at least since well, only 2 makeup so far match mine remotely. 

That said, it's  always sad when I want to use poses and makeup and I can't because only default skin is available. I really wish LN was more inclusive but I'm aware it's a Chinese app originally and that's farfetched. I just kind of accept it and use poc skin tones when I can."
LoveNikki,fowoq6p,t3_g9se0d,1588124003.0,In love with this

LoveNikki,folr6p8,t3_g7u5dg,1587868561.0,Same. I should have known given my usual shit luck with LN but foolishly I spent my only dias and got the only suit I didnt like.
LoveNikki,folr193,t3_g7wuyw,1587868460.0,This was my first response to this suit when I got it. Immediately made it as dark as I could lol

LoveNikki,fo2na98,t1_fo26ofn,1587468624.0,Truuue. It took some time for me to realise that even descriptions on the clothes meant something. There's a lot we miss that I'd appreciate to see put together.
LoveNikki,fo1ruva,t1_fo1qdil,1587440043.0,100%. I was on the edge of my seat reading the Neva scenes
LoveNikki,fo1rns9,t1_fo1pf2o,1587439910.0,"Yesss an archive would be good too if they don't want to go through the trouble of producing new content. I like so much of the story, I just want to read it properly."

LoveNikki,fo1ammg,t1_fo1abqe,1587429182.0,Is there??? I would actually  love to get into it. I have quite a bit of time on my hands these days lol
LoveNikki,fo1aido,t3_g4wcbs,1587429112.0,All the stories have us some nice insight. I'll take any Nidhogg content they toss my way

BlackPeopleTwitter,fnwtz3i,t3_g3zp88,1587325402.0,"Got called selfish yesterday because I hadn't reached out to someone. As someone with anxiety (and panic attacks that can go on for days) who has been struggling every day because of the pandemic and isolation, I know i can't take care of anyone else rn.

rupaulsdragrace,fnvrnkx,t3_g45wum,1587302928.0,Eh...it was fine. Its probably the only drag race season I haven't rewatched though (and I rewatch drag race far too much). It had some if my loves but I'll pass.
rupaulsdragrace,fnuiakq,t3_g3rpwa,1587262750.0,Black. Velvet. I love all of these but black velvet has stayed with me for years. Love!

rupaulsdragrace,fl45k9r,t3_fme6w9,1584806384.0,Just finished the episode and I'm surprised to be this mad this early in a season. That was bullshit. Riggamorris
Anxiety,fkxpfmf,t1_fkuznrx,1584632866.0,Its dreadful (lmao I'm so sorry)  but it does help to know that I'm not alone and that it will end.
Anxiety,fktpa8r,t3_fkayil,1584529889.0,"Idk if this will help but I drink water to remind myself I can swallow and I distract myself with something. It helps to remind myself ""You weren't short of breath while that show distracted you."" Or ""See, your throat is fine."" Or ""For a few minutes after you woke up you were breathing just fine."" My body ignores me of course, but it helps get my mind through it. 

I'm fairly new to having such long panic attacks (day 5 🙃 and counting) and such physical symptoms but it helps to keep my mind as calm as I can get it until my body catches up. Good luck ❤"
Anxiety,fktooqt,t1_fkrtvmf,1584529211.0,SAME. I went to my doctor last week because rationally I knew it was just my sinus draining like it always does (up to last month??? Smh) but I'm still having panic attacks on and off days later even though he confirmed it's just the regular thing. My poor body is either revved up to 100 convinced I'm dying or crashing because I'm exhausted. So glad I can work from home for the next week. Miss Rona has me on edge.

LoveNikki,fkk7xf3,t3_fhk55r,1584276595.0,When I realised I hadn't seen the story into before I started skipping through and not reading at all. Figured it was all spoilers.  The game itself was a lot of fun though
LoveNikki,fkk73je,t3_fj0osf,1584275806.0,This is probably one of the best things I've ever seen made on LN (I'm a big potterhead though so I'm a tiny bit biased). I adore this!
