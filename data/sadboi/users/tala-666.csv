Rabbits,fjbuag4,t1_fjbu3xp,1583201564.0,Thank you so much!
Rabbits,fjbkbuq,t1_fjbjejl,1583195224.0,"Yes Iâ€™ve confirmed that she is, in fact, real. Insane."
Rabbits,fjaqoo0,t3_fchs1b,1583178749.0,Sometimes I have to ask myself if sheâ€™s real because LOOK AT THOSE CHEEKS
Rabbits,fh72u4a,t1_fh71s6t,1581313183.0,I try so hard to hold it back since she always tries to take the whole thing from me and run away with it ðŸ˜­
Rabbits,fh6xe5v,t1_fh6wwk5,1581308549.0,So damn true though
Rabbits,fh6vtsd,t1_fh6unql,1581307392.0,Thank you!! ðŸ’›
Rabbits,ffegrsj,t1_ffegczd,1579847399.0,Lmaooo I definitely forgot to do this somehow. Thank you for the reminder!
Rabbits,ffdlrxl,t1_ffdljfk,1579823584.0,"Yes, I currently do both of those things! Eventually it will work out, she definitely isnâ€™t completely used to the new place either, and she LOVES the carpet so I knew there would be difficulties lmao. Thank you so much! :)"
Rabbits,ffdle93,t1_ffdl6zf,1579823353.0,Ahhh I know itâ€™s terribly annoying. Itâ€™s in the nearest corner and her hay is only accessible in there but I swear sometimes she jumps out and pees right in front of it like she thinks she is not supposed to go in there! Iâ€™ll just try moving the box very close to the door and hope for the best.
Rabbits,ffdkrcj,t1_ffdkk77,1579822959.0,"I tried, and it got a bit better, except the place she likes using is in front of a door unfortunately!!"
Rabbits,ffdko7y,t1_ffdjy09,1579822906.0,"She definitely likes it better without the top, but still not as much. Iâ€™m thinking itâ€™s the spot itâ€™s in but I canâ€™t move it to where she likes going because itâ€™s in front of the door ðŸ˜­"
ClinicalPsychology,fbw3mi1,t1_fbw21fm,1577140313.0,"Many ABA therapy programs in my area hire therapists with just a HS diploma. You just get paid more if you do have a higher ed degree. Iâ€™m not sure if other areas are the same, though."
ClinicalPsychology,fb8znij,t1_fb8w08d,1576625674.0,"I never thought about that, but it makes a lot of sense. Thank you! :)"
ClinicalPsychology,fb4t1ri,t1_fb4gxod,1576515010.0,"Not yet. No, Iâ€™m not limited. I get that Iâ€™ll have a better chance if Iâ€™m open to more locations."
ClinicalPsychology,fb4susq,t1_fb3yrb4,1576514920.0,"Thanks for the info! Yeah, the research Iâ€™m doing is with that population."
BPD,fb3kxxj,t3_eb6mot,1576476814.0,This is huge! Very proud of you :)
ClinicalPsychology,fb3isvs,t1_fb3irl7,1576474560.0,"I will definitely look into that, thanks so much!"
ClinicalPsychology,fb3ha2b,t1_fb3h12j,1576473078.0,"Interesting, thanks so much! :)"
ClinicalPsychology,fb3dui8,t1_fb3dduy,1576470421.0,"Iâ€™ll look into getting more research experience. What kind of research work would need to be done for it to be considered sufficient?

Iâ€™m in California, a doctoral degree is needed here unfortunately."
ClinicalPsychology,fb3d4bg,t1_fb3ckli,1576469904.0,"Thanks for the tips! Iâ€™m still working as a research assistant, and planning on going for another half a year, so a total of one year experience. In my role as one, so far, I have worked on coding data, and will continue to do so and present our data at an exhibit at the end of our project. If possible, Iâ€™d love to get more experience doing research as I know itâ€™ll benefit me.

And I forgot to mention that I eventually want to be a private practitioner, which is why Iâ€™d need a doctoral degree in clinical psychology."
Rabbits,fauq0bb,t1_fasenx7,1576351037.0,"Yeah, was just thinking of metal. Thank you!"
VeganFoodPorn,far3u5k,t3_ea6bnf,1576311850.0,This place is the best. Expensive but damn itâ€™s good.
crueltyfree,eu9l4ai,t1_eu9kfmn,1563583523.0,"Yeah, I was going to say Batiste is the only thing that worked for me and itâ€™s so difficult finding a CF version. Good luck though!!"
crueltyfree,eu9k2gp,t1_eu9jye2,1563582692.0,"Oh yeah, that definitely helps Iâ€™d imagine. What dry shampoo do you use?"
crueltyfree,eu9jno8,t1_eu9jg1n,1563582371.0,"I havenâ€™t! But I heard good things about it, seems a little pricey but Iâ€™m interested in trying it if it really helps my thin hair. Thank you! :)"
