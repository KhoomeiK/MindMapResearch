So after this Covid stuff is over I got to start all over again if I want a quality of life. Something I do not have now being in extreme pain, the current meds for anxiety I have to take after being told to drop the 3mg of Klonopin I was taking, don’t really work. On top of all of that, The doctor at the methadone clinic keeps saying I should be fine on my current dose, yet I go into withdrawal around 4pm everyday and my pain gets so much worse. If anything, going to the clinic has made my life worse (Note: I was not addicted to an opiate before going to the clinic. I actually had to go find some heroin to test dirty to be accepted to the clinic, like pain management told me to, cuz I’m problematic and he didn’t want to treat me.)"

No trouble, they held my dose at 75mg a little bit after I got there cuz it took me a minute to taper down off my anxiety medication, but I’ve been off klonopin for over 3 months, I saw the counselor 2 weeks before I saw the doctor and she upped me to where I’m at 85mg. Which was hard to get them to do. When I saw the doctor, since I was just upped 2 weeks ago by my councilor, he didn’t change anything to see if 85mg would work. It wasn’t then and still isn’t now. Though to be completely honest, Pain Management sent me there. The doctor at the methadone clinic was very adamant that they do not treat pain, but they would help treat an addiction. I’ve been suspecting that’s why they’re reluctant to up my dose. However, as I’ve told them, even if I do not give in, the cravings are horrible, worse since I started methadone. A lot of this is psychological, I believe, because it seems like I should be helping my pain and just isn’t. Around 12/1 pm I start to wear down, depending on what I’ve been doing. Everyday is a calculation on what I need/want to do and how much these will effect what I I can do later. At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon I start withdrawing. Wake up tomorrow, rinse and repeat. I don’t know."
Methadone,fmsbqe3,t1_fmrkbrv,1586351968.0,"I go to a clinic in NW Indiana, and the only rule relaxing they’ve done is to give the people who come everyday because they pop for weed in their UA and feel they’re high risk for getting the virus some takehomes.

But a younger woman with Lupus (causes immunodeficiency), and has a 4yo son and I (about 35yo with asthma and a host of issues created by my genetic disorder, and I live with an essential employee at our local hospital) still have to go everyday. Though I should point out both guys have the only councilor at my clinic who is doing anything for their patients right now, as none of the other councilors see the virus as an issue any of their patients would ever have to deal with."

I keep popping for amphetamines though I don’t use them (I hate the effects), though I realize one of my prescriptions can cause a false positive (Wellbutrin) and my otc sinus medication is probably doing so as well because it contains pseudoephedrine. The only thing besides methadone I should be positive for is THC, which I had no traces of in last months test, though I should have. I took my test today, so I’ll see what happens this month, I would like to get some take homes while the virus is a problem, I live with someone who works at the local hospital and I have asthma. For the past week and a half I’ve been getting run down earlier than I have been. At about 4pm, I start to go into withdrawals, where it had been holding me at least until I went to bed. The doctor says I’m at a good level and I don’t need to go up anymore (it was already hard enough to get to the level I’m at now).

Yes, this even includes people who are at risk for the virus or live with someone who is (those with immuno-suppressant disorders or breathing problems, live with or care for small children or the elderly, those who recently have had surgery or an illness, etc.) The clinic is currently allowing one person in at a time (though this usually ends up being around 4 patients, any and all staff and the security guard, due to space in the lobby) So its a one in, one out situation, everyone else has to line up outside and wait, if you want to dose. Inside they are running the clinic like normal, as if there is no pandemic, so patients are expected to see the doctor, get UA’s, see counseling and receive take homes, if you are qualified to get them. On Monday they threatened us outside if we continued to stand closer than 6 feet away from the person on either side of us, they would stop dosing and shut the clinic down. They did stop dosing for 25 minutes around that point, though some people were saying it was a computer problem (I was not inside, so I don’t know for sure) The clinic will remain open, so we can come everyday to dose. Even with the travel restrictions, as I and several others come from outside the county. Monday I waited for over 2 hours to get in, today (Tuesday) wasn’t so bad, I only had to wait around 45 minutes. It all wouldn’t be so bad if it was warmer than freezing outside.

Calling my councilor won’t work. I’ve seen her once in the last two months, and when I ask for her she’s either not there or too busy. I have only been going four months so far.

I get told I’m too young to be in pain, it took me 3 years to get in to see a different pain management doctor. He just sent me to the methadone clinic and want them to take care of me, even lying, saying he doesn’t prescribe medication (he does the shots for back pain and whatnot.)

I still get railroaded by my hand and wrist pain and can’t really do much of anything because when they get this bad I can’t use a pen or pencil, or hold a drink, let alone clean, cook, properly take care of myself or my dogs. I don’t even know what to do to get any help.
Most of my problem is due to my age and look. I was born with malformed hands, missing 3 fingers due to my father’s exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam.

I was being sarcastic about it going smoothly next month, but at least I see my psych doctor next month as well and can actually talk to her about tapering properly the rest of the way down. My problem was the clinic (who told me I should taper off the benzos 25% at a time, and went behind my back and told my psych doctor to give me me 1 .5mg a day for 21 days, when last month I was taking 3 1mg a day. That is a significant drop, but then after the .5’s are gone I should be done tapering off completely. With no regard for anything else that may happen. But in no way am I against tapering off the benzos, I just want it done safely. Which according to the nurse practitioner and some of you guys don’t believe is necessary, though I’ve been on benzos for over 10 years. Cuz after that what is keeping them from tapering my Methadone from my current dose, 75mg to 0 when they decide I’m done with that too?

So what should I do? 
Edit:/ I’m not against tapering off the benzos, I just wanted to do it safely, and you’re saying that is foolish. So I should just take the sudden 2.5mg drop, although it was not what the nurse practitioner and I discussed and be done in 21 days.

bipolar2,fdk7tcq,t3_elimao,1578498047.0,"I’m sorry, I feel your pain. I once had a psych dr say I wasn’t bp2, or not bp at all because I couldn’t estimate or know when (to the day) I was having manic/hypomanic episodes. Like I was supposed to know in the future, like when a girl tracks their period."

bipolar2,fdhc8ar,t3_eledub,1578419789.0,"I have bipolar type 2 and am on disability. Now I also have a physical disability from my dad being heavily exposed to agent orange in Vietnam. I was accepted right away, which was I believe to do with my physical problems but I cannot work any more with being bipolar 2, than if I could without the physical problems. For psych problems you may have to apply more than once, which is what most people have to do anyway. Just don’t get discouraged if they deny you the first time. Be sure to go see their doctors when they ask, if you jump through their hoops it goes a lot quicker. And I’d recommend if they deny you a second time, finding a social security lawyer (if you can afford it) or a mental health advocate. Hopefully your doctor should be able to help you find someone to help."

dogpictures,fdgyk0a,t3_el9qpa,1578411464.0,"That’s awesome, I’ve adopted a dog that was dumped at the shelter from a puppy mill, she was dumped because she went into heat so soon after weening her first set of pups, she was useless to them. She was underweight at 9lbs. Filled out to a nice 15lbs after I brought her home. She had also scratched off all her fur from being so infested with fleas when she got to the shelter. (She was a beautiful one year old Boston, that my aunt, who was doing dog rescue and called up the shelter to keep her from being put down the night before we could go the 3hrs to go see her) I saw in as bad shape as she was, she wasn’t ready to go, you could see it in her eyes and ended up being one of the best dogs I’ve ever had. She passed on at the age of 16 a year ago, but lived a full life with me. I moved across the country and she came with. When her eyesight started to go we found her two balls, one that clashed with the grass outside, one that clashed with the hardwood inside, so she could still make them out and would still have to get her to stop playing so she didn’t overtire herself. The best $30 I’ve ever spent (she was half off because she was gonna be put down). I know how great these dogs are and how much happiness and love they have to give you. Congratulations on making one of the best choices you ever will. And I’m sure her friend will appreciate it as much as she does."

Methadone,fdffypa,t3_ekzil9,1578360794.0,I was referred to a Methadone clinic by pain management because I’m “to young” (37) to be on opiates according to the doctor.
opiates,fdffl28,t3_ekvcor,1578360539.0,"I’m going to a Methadone clinic every morning because at 37, I’m too young for pain management and this was the doctor’s solution.

TrueOffMyChest,fcvq1kp,t1_fcttmny,1578007520.0,"My entire high school experience was like this. Doesn’t matter if it’s illness, including surgery, family emergencies, the pregnant students childbirth if the father was still involved they were not allowed to leave school property at all, family funerals, college visits (if a senior). You could only miss 2 days per semester/trimester, period. If you missed more than 8 to 10 days (even if you were hospitalized) The school made it a legal issue. When I missed a bunch of days during middle school they threatened to arrest my mom."
askpsychology,fcvkdn7,t3_eiwje3,1578003964.0,"I’ve wondered about this. I remember at least on 5 different occasions, starting at the age of 12 where I had to spend the night talking him out of suicide. And would barely be able to function the next day at school."
BipolarReddit,fcp4te1,t3_ei8b0z,1577850486.0,"I was not on the Lamotrigine as well, but just the Celexa (along with Effexor) made my manic symptoms very intense. I was still in high school at the time and was still diagnosed with severe depression with anxiety issues. However the addition of the Celexa made me feel akin to what a meth binge must feel like. The thoughts in my head were going so fast I couldn’t focus on anything for more than a minute or two, I was so “wound up” it was coming out in my physical behavior. I couldn’t sit still, changing the position at my desk nearly every 2 1/2 to 4 minutes. (One teacher made me sit outside the classroom and I was written up several times for distraction in the classroom). The school red-flagged me for suicidal actions (?) and possible drug use. (This was also shortly after the Columbine school shootings school shootings). My thought speed made it impossible to do any work, or sleep. Thankfully it was noticed very quickly by my mother noticed very quickly And was taken off the Celexa fairly quickly."

DecidingToBeBetter,fb8c5f8,t3_ebjub9,1576610714.0,"I’m missing my pointer and middle fingers on my right hand from birth. I’m working with a thumb, a permanently bent ring finger and a pinky finger. I just grab their hand with my thumb on top of their hand and fit their fingers in the gap and put pressure below with my ring and pinky fingers. I grab the persons hand firmly like that and shake. It’s take a long time to not be ashamed of the way I was born, but now I just offer my hand to shake confidently and if they don’t or freak about it, screw ‘em. They should be ashamed of themselves for not greeting you as a fellow human being."
