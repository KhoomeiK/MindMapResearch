Stop wanting validation and attention from people (dont chase the bag let the bag chase you) i used to care about wanting people to give me attention but now i couldn't care less, and more that i don't ask / care for it people want to talk to me etc. You're still young, move away from the childish thinking of always wanting attention and pursue something thats more valuable (self: love, worth, understanding and care) . remember, you have to love yourself before other can love you & you have to love yourself before you can love others.

mentalillness,fj29yf2,t1_fj1lkzs,1582938293.0,"Damn dude it sounds like youve been through a lots, its very brave of you to share this and I commend you for your pure honesty / transparent sharing of whats going on in your life. My case of scenario making doesn't run this deep into my mind to where i get mad and abusive but whenever my mind makes up a scenario where I'm arguing with a person I'll start to get fired up and feel my heart heat up and anger build in my body. At this point I'm usually at the end of my scenario and snap out of it by slapping my face. Thank you for sharing your story with us, because it's actually quite motivating. To see somebody's heart felt and open comment makes me want to open up more.

Hope everything's going well for you and that your problem is fixed / gets controlled. All the best to you and your friends & family. Have a good day, god bless. ❤️"

Sorry if my explanation is poor but if you read my previous comment you may understand what I'm talking about and what my problem is. Thanks"
AskReddit,fj0hi0s,t3_fanoll,1582900089.0,"I haven't fully stopped this but sometimes when its very quiet and my mind does what to have silence or just to be at peace I create scenarios / false realities in my mind and speak (move my mouth and all) the words that are being said in my head by these fake characters. It gets so bad that I make scenarios in my head that I either
- start laughing out loud, which to people in the real word is weird because why am i laughing at nothing
- I start to speak too loud to where my parents would ask me who am i talking to while im sitting alone 
- the reality in my mind is so real to me that I sometimes getn mad at a person IRL that I was mad at in my head (reality / scenario created in my head). this is the worst one because i love my friends and family and I don't want to he mean to them for literally doing nothing to me IRL

This, making of seemingly real scenarios / fake realities only happens when I'm super bored, very quiet outside/ around me or when i haven't spoken to someone like a friend in a while. Its annoying af because I never notice it until mid way but i now snap myself out of it asap when i realise im doing it.

If anyone knows if there's something wrong with me, in all seriousness please tell me what this means, if I'm going nuts or is maybe a sign of some sort of mental illness.

For now its nothing too serious but you can never be too cautous. Thanks for reading my dumb ass problem , if you have any tips on how to fully stop this, plz say so. Thanks again for reading."
AskReddit,fj0ge37,t3_fanoll,1582899334.0,"Swearing. Everytime i heard myself swearing in a video, i just cringed so hard because its not hard to think of multiple other words to express yourself better than a swear word, it makes me sound dumb when i swear because it used to come out like verbal diarrhea. I still swear every now or so but its now out of damn near extreme frustration or anger (which is rare) but its better then every regular sentence having at least 2 swear words in it.
