BPD,fr2ggao,t3_gm4j3f,1589836859.0,"that exact feeling, that exact word, have been the worst torture i ever felt. it spirals at the speed of light when it hits. even when someone likes me, i don't know why they like me and so i immediately feel like it's only a matter of time until they don't. so unfair that feeling unloveable can be even more intense when no one rejects me. i came to understand these are intense abandonment issues, and that for me it boiled down to telling myself i was unloveable to avoid rejections at all costs. it wasn't simply a matter of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, it's like i'd also be throwing out the wash basin, the sink, the bathroom, the whole house, too, and all in a flash. understanding the intensity of abandonment issues, and looking at them separately as only a piece of the puzzle, helped. it took a long time. this is one of the worst feelings. i see that below your post, automoderator says ""OP may not be seeking advice"". sorry if i'm overstepping but i feel for you sooooooo hard. the other word i seemed to use a lot was 'invisible'. i felt both. both were the emptiest feelings. i did so many bad behaviors, drugs, smoking, overeating, lashing out at someone out of the blue who wasn't the one who made me feel unloveable or invisible--to avoid these feelings at all costs, could not even look at them or what may have been causing them. i hope that you can find your way out of it. take care."

BPD,fqal387,t1_fq103e4,1589220894.0,i think a lot of us gravitate toward therapy because we are looking for answers for ourselves and many of us don't find them with therapists so we go more directly to the source. i think that's because a lot of us don't seem to know how to give up no matter how hopeless we feel. it's like an obsession.

BPD,fq1i4bh,t3_ggem9g,1589045857.0,"i was a technical writer and i think this is an amazing career for someone with bpd. it's about taking things that are confusing and making them clear and orderly. you don't need any technical aptitude to do it because you are writing about how to do something, such as use yahoo mail or google maps, for someone who is not technical and wants it to be simple. but, because it's technical subject matter, the answer, the clarity is there, it's not fluid or changing so it doesn't mess with your mind or your emotions. it's just a matter of finding it. it takes a lot of intelligence and you work with other intelligent people, aka engineers, so that's gratifying. it's very well paid. you don't spend that much of your time working with anyone else so that's nice. you can do most of it from home or you can work in an office so that gels with the wildly different moods caused by my bpd, anything from manic to almost agoraphobic. in a high tech setting, you will work with lots of autistic, ocd, other kinds of non-mainstream personalities because these kinds of people can excel at software progamming and coding, so you often don't feel like the only freak in the room and these other 'freaks' (i say that very affectionately) are more obvious so that takes attention away from any weird behavior that i exhibit and also just makes it a ver accepting environment where the focus is on the work and the product rather than on office politics, etc. the best tech writers are self starters that make their own innovations rather than following the rules or waiting to be told what to do, so this gelled will with my manic tendencies. my documents could be characterized by the bpd tendency to overshare, but i got to edit them before anyone saw them so that worked... i had a long very successful career and became financially independent. I strongly feel bpd actually suited me for this work, made me a better tech writer, not just that it was a career that could work around my bpd. check it out."

BPD,fpxzrmp,t3_gfoeay,1588992940.0,"it's a big problem for me, too. sometimes it's just kind of manic--like everything is so interesting and connected and therefore i have to say it all, usually happens when i feel like someone likes me and like i have to get it all out in case i am never again in the presence of someone who will like me. afterward i feel like doing that made them not like me. sometimes it's weirdly flirty and coy but i can't stop it, i don't know what causes that. the times i hate the most are when it's as if i have ripped off all of my clothes and am not only oversharing, i'm making sure i give reasons and draw conclusions that i fear others won't get and it's up to me to wrap it all up for them while also simultaneously justifying why i am doing all of this. this always has a weird sense of compulsion to prove that i'm who i perceive this person expects me to be, be it soothing because they are upset, vulnerable because they are closed off, in control because they aren't, funny because -- i have no idea why-- smart because i for whatever random reason feel it will help them feel intelligent because someone is talking to them as if they are. it's really out of control and i feel at the time like something has taken over my mouth, not me. as far as i can guess, it's actually a desperate attempt to be hiding in plain sight, and what i'm probably trying to hide is the fact that i have this terrible disease and i don't want anyone to know that they are in the presence of someone this insane. it's all exhausting. it's always, always, always followed by regret and a sense of humiliation, as if i was a big phony, but it's not like i was actually trying to prove anything... the older i get, the more peaceful i find it to be alone, and i like it. it's as if having other people in the picture is disruptive. being alone doesn't make me sad, though. there are people with whom i can like who i am when i am around them. i have no idea what makes someone in that category and what makes them not there."

BPD,fpd357f,t1_fp9o20z,1588518843.0,"wow you nailed it. i've gotten a lot better with this, too, but before i ever was ablet to look at it, not only could i not stop it, once i was mad at some, like i thought i had to have a whole catalog of reasons in order to justify saying anything to them about it. i'd fantasize compulsively the conversations in which i'd confront them and i felt like i wasn't justified expressing anger unless i could sound supremely and convincingly victimlike. Almost always, the confrontation ended in a black split, with me doing the splitting. Once i realized that getting mad would for sure mean i'm ending the friendship, i suffered in silence even more. finally, i began to realize that being this way, with quiet BPD, made me prone to hooking up with unhealthy, extremely self centered people, so that's one of the things i've been able to look at and change, and that has helped with the anger. but a lot of the time i'm severely berating myself for being a drama queen because of this kind of anger and because of how i can't let it go, even when, as you said, the other person apologizes and tries to make it better. i never know what to do with the apology, as if i'm so embarrassed by my outburst that accepting the apology feels--i don't even know what happens. on the outside i seem like the most generous, accommodating, caring, silly, opinionless and go with the flow person. it's really a struggle. the other thing that helped was taking the plunge and telling my therapist the details of the most childish fantasy arguments that compulsively run in my head, how in these i see myself as such a victim. it's all operatic and dramatic. it was extremely embarrassing to reveal that side of myself, but once i heard them out loud, i was able to have more perspective on them when they happened inside my head. they aren't the kinds of things you can tell a friend. i felt so lucky that i at least have the capacity to take a chance on trusting a therapist."
BPD,foh8nqn,t3_g7dt1n,1587761872.0,"i have the same intensity of experience. anything that i start to trust as 'recovery' immediately goes sour and becomes a source of torture, with mocking EPs or whatever you want to call them (voices?) in my head literally laughing at me, saying things like OMG she fell for it again, she actually thought there was hope for her, what a loser! She's hilarious how she falls for it every time. Yet, i fall for hope every time and will probably continue to do so because i just won't give up. 

It has become helpful to me to just decide i'm not like anyone else. I realized all my life i'd gone for some image of 'recovered' or 'healthy' that simply doesn't apply to me. I percieve almost everything differently than the way others do. There are things that give pleasure, things that engage BPD-sized emotions such as 19th century classical music which is both emotionally and intellectually passionate, most art forms, linguistics because probably i'm so curious about how the mind works in all its manifestations aka 'normal' vs 'mine' heh, science and mechanics probably because the solutions are 100% objective and it can be soothing to spend some time in an intellectual environment that isn't shifting and changing so much it's hard to tell what to trust--my eyes, my ears, my perception: are any of these playing tricks on me right now? This disease is still there and still capable of rearing its ugly head at any time but i do have these oases to hide out in sometimes and when they work for me, it's something i can cherish. It seems to boil down to the great pleasure of having a LOT of curiosity, and this is something that I think is definitely present in someone with BPD, something the disease would make us tend to develop by the truckload. 

It seems like many people with DID really don't want to integrate their separate selves. I feel like i can understand why and that this is a good model for me even though I don't have DID. I mean, the adamance to not integrate, not become like everyone else, makes sense to me and i think, it must be people who don't have the experience of DID imposing this standard of what it means to be 'healthy' on them. It seems to me to be completely valid that they can have their own definition of 'healthy'. They're the ones with the experience. 

Anyway, thanks for this very interesting post!"
BPD,foh5wgc,t3_g7878q,1587760891.0,"i grab a notebook and try to write down the cacophany in my head. writing kind of slows it down because the physical act of writing is so much slower than thinking. i'm not going for profound or even for making sense. i'm just writing down what i'm 'hearing', trying to pick one thing out of the barrage, then another, then another so that they go from being a wall of noise to something i can address or at least see...

another simple thing is to say things to myself like 'this is dissociation, this is wht's happening' or 'this is bpd, this is my bpd acting up'. i might have to keep saying it -- not like a mantra, more like because the turmoil isn't necessarily subsiding -- but it can sort of take the dissociation to go off on its own. probably, what i say to myself isn't what will work for you, but you get the gist. sometimes, it's surprisingly soothing to tell myself 'i'm not like other people. i don't have to be like other people.'--for me the key is saying it low key, not like it's an accomplishment or an affirmation, more like it's a way to stay grounded to ride out the current storm. 

good luck. sounds like what you are going through is hard. <3. no matter how clumsy i or possibly other people in this subgroup may articulate it, we get it--we get you."

BPD,fidbmox,t1_fic5dxx,1582365012.0,"I think that if some trauma happened to us too early for us to remember it, like we were babies whose personalities hadn't formed yet, then we weren't able to defend ourselves or even parse what was happening to us. Which is how BPD happens according to everything I have read. So that would naturally make us permanently on high alert and also make us feel like we never know when or where the next attack may be coming from. So, all the time, whatever part of me formed to want to protect me is kind of panicking and looking for possible danger without the maturity to know whether I'm actually in danger or not. It just wants to make sure I won't be hurt again. Other parts of me formed later and are more mature and have better judgement but that protector keeps screaming danger! Danger! And she can either drown the other parts of me out or else be so loud and aggressive that the other parts just can't keep up. she is always demanding to be heard. Probably, the logical parts want to honor her, too, because she helped me survive? Idk. But what helps me sometimes is to sit and try to write the fucking noisy and chaotic argument going on in my head. Writing takes longer so it can help slow the argument down to a speed where I can hear what's going on. It can make that threatened tiny girl in my head feel more threatened or tricked but it can also make her feel real and heard. It might be slowly helping me heal, I hope so, but mainly it gets me through these horrible panics and helps me think I can help myself even if no one else can, and historically no one else could because who could ever understand that all of this could be going on in someone's head."

BPD,fi9lwie,t1_fi7sf5a,1582271079.0,"I was a little so cheated on the night before an abortion. It more than anything else convinced me that I was an unloveable monster and aberration. I went back to him, with similar idolizing him to what you describe, and a couple of girlfriends dropped me saying they could not go through putting a shattered me back together another time when he did the next horrible and degrading thing to me. I'm a lot older than you and have had a few decades to parse it. It does get better. I think those girlfriends changed my life with that honest gesture because nothing less could have opened my eyes although it still took a few years. Two eventual takeaways: that passion, you take it with you. It may have been new with him but it's not tied to him. The other is that he was a crash course, the perfect incubator for learning about myself as a passionate woman, the staying with him was a new experience if me trying to fight for what I wanted. Now I can understand it in the context of being someone with BPD sized emotions, but it's still me. With someone who loved me back I would have been too scared to really feel it all. Sounds sad,. I know, but it was something I needed to learn one way or another, and with him it took only six years rather than a lifetime. It's soul destroying for sure but if you can be objective about what you wanted from it maybe it will help? This guy was a vehicle for finally feeling all of my emotions instead of always trying to hold back because I felt like I would flood the world if I didn't. I had to look at what I got from it besides heartache to learn how to get that with men who were also capable of love... Which took more courage than anything else in my life, ever. I hope you can find some actual meaning in it. Sometimes it helps me to simply remember that I'm not like other people and I don't have to be, especially because I can't be so I may as well stop trying to be. There are definitely benefits to being so emotional even though it can be really hard to see that."
BPD,fh23tmv,t3_f0vt98,1581233952.0,"Yeah when I found this forum it somehow helped me endure that feeling to know others have the same, so I want to speak up right now and say that your post describes me too, pretty much exactly. Every way I ever tried to fix or jump out of or fight back at it just felt so phony. Sometimes I thought I was nailing it and always within a couple of days my brain would literally laugh at me with 'omg she fell for it again!!! She is hilarious, what a loser, she actually thought she could have a personality and make people like her!' and people did actually like me and I had to run away because I had no idea who they saw or who it was they liked and I had no idea how to be her the next time I saw them. Living this way was torture. I had no idea it was a disease and not just me. I couldn't even articulate it in therapy even though I had a great therapist who helped me with depression, saving my life. The emptiness made me feel suicidal. The depression was horrible but when I wondered why it didn't also make me suicidal, I realized that at least it was *something*. At least I was feeling something. It was terrible to realize depression was not as bad as it gets, something could be even worse than that. Anyway, the advice from other responses to your post, that it passes, was also effective for me. It helped to learn to ride it out, like an infection, one with an insidious symptom that this was who you are, you will never feel any other way. It does pass. Somehow try to keep remembering that while it's happening and try to avoid the horror of blaming yourself no matter how relentless that feeling is at the time. Those are honestly symptoms and not reality. I hope you can find ways to get through it when it happens. Fwiw I'm sending you virtual hugs and telling you that even from your post, not knowing any more about you than that, I can see someone, a definite person, not in any way merely some sort of miasma.

It's not a logical disease.  However, congratulations on the promotion, srsly! So many people with this disease can't even hold jobs... If dealing with the kudos and attention gets hard at all, concentrate on the work because you are obviously good at what you do and probably bring a lot of smarts and creativity to it.

The more I read about BPD and the more posts I relate to or read and then feel like I could have written myself, the more I see how BPD is me. My therapist didn't agree because I don't act out or lash out, and she thought that's one of the major symptoms. I've told her that I don't necessarily care what my diagnosis is but that BPD provided an effective framework for me to process and understand what is going on in my head. It also helps me see the enormity and scope of what I'm dealing with.  She is completely on board with that approach and has helped me explore it. I'm not saying this well. The point is that we didn't end up spending any time arguing about my diagnosis and have been able to focus on my healing within the context of BPD and I feel comfortable talking about and mentioning BPD in our sessions. Hope this rambling answer helps..."
BPD,fdoofcm,t1_fdmxabh,1578609319.0,"One astonishingly helpful thing I've gotten from participating in this sub and following links that people often provide, such as the one you included, was simply starting to acquire a vocabulary to help me understand what happens to me when I split, and a framework for putting me dizzying symptoms into some sort of context. Even the term 'split', the concept of it can get me through a terrifying experience. I can remember sometimes to think 'splitting' or 'im splitting' or even just 'bpd, this is bpd' helps me ride it out. For 60 years I lived in so much pain that I couldn't get a handle on or articulate even to myself. Then I discovered this sub and realized I'm not alone and not horrible no matter how much the disease tries to convince me that I am. I have very often felt the same frustration as the op that we aren't prepared by the medical community to do battle with what we have to face on a daily or hourly basis. I don't want to argue with a Dr about my diagnosis and whether my symptoms match the criteria. I just want to help, to learn how to help myself. All my life I've been willing to do absolutely anything to try to abate the pointless torment and finally that torment has a name. It's life changing."
BPD,fdolsok,t1_fdnnadn,1578607742.0,I like your post.
BPD,fdolp2i,t1_fdo9law,1578607682.0,I could have written this. Thanks for nailing so perfectly.
BPD,famhweb,t3_e9pgq9,1576204265.0,"so many ways to agree with you! 1) my mind blocks the thought of getting better because i would have to be a completely different person then. for all the torture of bpd and loneliness, i really do love how active it makes your mind. i love how it makes me see things from so many frikking angles at once. when it's personal turmoil such as does someone love me or hate me, it's torture. but when it's something objective like what a novel means or what's the difference between math and logic, i absolutely love it. 2) when i feel like i'm starting to get better i find myself back at square 1, as if i'd blanked out and fallen back there somehow. there's a feeling, though, that -- i'm so good at faking normal that i panic that that's all i'm doing when i'm 'getting better' and i know that what tortures me is super complex and i panic that i will stop myself from getting the help i need. 3) it feels like so many personalities or persona in me shouting all the time, i think the thought of getting better makes most of 'them' feel like they are going to get left behind so they sabotage it, and then i get scared and frustrated because i know i will sabotage anything and i don't want to try to get help anymore. 4) there's this weird component of picturing myself as normal that seems to negate all the struggle i've had and that struggle is such a big part of me and i am something like very proud of it. ...it's a total conundrum for me how the thought of getting better feels like i would have to be someone else while at the same time i literally have no sense of self. so, here's a question for you: do you have an image of what 'better' means or looks like to you? afaik it's a well known symptom of bpd, that we are resistant to treatment and also to taking care of ourselves in basic ways like sleep, showering, brushing your teeth. i think it's why many therapists don't accept bpd clients. hang in there. great question."

I still struggle but now I *can* struggle instead of feeling nothing but overwhelmed. I also love hearing about never giving up, not because I am or can even tolerate any kind of rah-rah thinking. The struggle is so confusing and so unfair the way it changes symptoms and angles of attack that it takes a lot more than believing in yourself. I like hearing about it because of how breathtaking is feels to realize I didn't give up even without knowing who I am or whether I even had a self to not give up on. I love hearing other people try to describe it, too.. thnks for your post!"
BPD,f6yla24,t3_dtfw13,1573285708.0,"the question i asked myself many times is why am i attracted to the people who don't care about my interests. it's like i keep trying to make myself invisible. i know that that there are people who take more interrest in me but they make me feel like a deer in the headlights. so i ask myself, what would happen if my SO became one of those people? would that make me freak out even though every day i wish he would... i want to learn how to be with people who love me. i'm freaked about how much courage that would require, because it is the most logical thing in the world. this is how i understand bpd. i ask myself, do i want to be rescued, do i want a rescuer? because that doesn't sound like a good relationship either. i want to be able to be my own rescuer."
BPD,f6osb8d,t3_drxby5,1573032200.0,"Absolutely. I want so much to feel and be sincere but it's like these different personae jump out before I have a chance. I watch them thinking wait is this me? I don't have groups of friends, just individual friends and I feel that if they were all in one room they would not think they all knew the same person. The dumbing down is also involuntary. I feel that BPD people are freakishly intelligent and that I feel like people leave or dismiss me because they feel something like intimidated and or they just find it boring to be around so much thinking. When I was single for four years I reached out to friends for help understanding why and they all said I was too intelligent. I was like no, I don't flirt by talking about Kant or quantum physics or Shakespeare. I don't... It's isolating, as if people leave me because of my good qualities not bad ones. I think it's obvious that I can be as goofy, clueless, etc as the next guy. The being different with everyone, not being able to be my whole self with anyone, is what creates the feeling of having no sense of self. It's like everything in me is determined to keep me hidden, safe, which I suppose is an effective response to trauma, except that happened when I was a kid and now I'm an adult but still trapped in this fortress"

However, you do sound like a solid and interesting person. Do you know what you want from friends? It sort of helped me to ponder that. Anything from shallow fun to mutual struggle with occasionally sick but mostly just clever senses of humor, support, shared activities... I looked around at people relating to each other and felt like I needed to learn to be social in all those ways, or couldn't tell the difference. Once I had this talk with myself (over days or weeks or whatever) I could start to gravitate to places where I might be more likely to connect with people. Sometimes only for the day such as volunteering at habitat for humanity so there was activity and I didn't have to concentrate on being interesting or other ways I Excel at being self conscious, etc. I can't say I ended up with a sense of self but I learned about what I don't really want so that was a good start.

BPD,f2u2zh8,t3_de9pfn,1570406013.0,"I've gone through this too. It always has turned out that the people who were crazy girl's friends aren't interested in the more real and probably healthier me. New friends appear on my radar every time but honestly then I can outgrow them, too. It feels like therapy is a commitment to forward motion no matter who or what may eventually fall away. I have gone from friends who never paid attention to me to people who I can actually percieve love me back but it was slow klutsy progress. This kind of person has probably always been around but I couldn't see them or was intimidated by them. I don't drink but I saw it happen very obviously to another friend who got sober. His super fun friends who I always envied basically turned on him, guilt tripped him for getting sober as if they were threatened by it. Maybe I'm just not wired to need connection as much as others but when I look back I see that friendships that fell away weren't healthy ones, that I had to be super entertaining or rescuing etc to keep them. I tended to go toward people who were always in crisis. I probably liked hiding behind their drama because I had no idea who I was.  It's very hard to go through, to think maybe that friend I had for a long time wasn't actually ever there for me. But it honestly always turned out that something better was just around the corner. Do you know what you want from friends? Maybe I'm missing your point just talking about me and if so I'm sorry! :) But this has been a common recurrence in my life."
BPD,f2u1ox0,t3_deasq5,1570405077.0,I'm also hyper vigilant. I sometimes explain to someone what their companion is trying to say to them even if I don't know them and so far I've nailed it each time.

This makes me think it wants help? Wants me to figure it out? I know this sounds crazy because of how I am describing it but this is how it feels. 'it', 'the disease', 'voices screaming at me in my head', whatever you want to call it. Anyway, I just keep going at it from different directions. It's tricky."

This disease is impossible to explain to people--how could anyone understand that someone doesn't have any idea who they are or thinks they are horrible and when you tell them they are wonderful they feel even worse like they have only tricked you into thinking they are wonderful? Reading posts by other people who get that makes me less scared of it. However, the part of me who has always tried to save and rescue everyone,even people who don't need or want it, as if having the role of saver and rescuer can substitute for my feeling like I have no personality or self, she goes crazy here reading about all the pain. That rescuer act is one of the main ways that I 'split' so it can be a black hole for me here."
BPD,f2qhuz9,t3_d7fhar,1570362163.0,"bpd vs did. i posted dae feel like they have did but without the blackouts, etc. a few did people responded and from that what i gather is this: the difference is with did the personalities completely split and become separate and identifiable. they even have names. in bpd, they don't split completely, they stay attached. the image that comes to my mind is hangnails or placenta that doesn't separate during the birth and needs to be surgically removed. relating my personal experience, it feels like the splits, the alters, in bpd, by staying 'attached' cause continual pain. one person who responded to me saying they had both did and bpd. i asked which was more painful and they said definitely bpd, and that made sense to me because no sense of self has always been terrifying to me. in fact, sometimes i feel i am impeding my healing because i will be able to figure out how to get out of the pain but that then i will have nothing left. like i'm buried alive and can get myself to ground level but will then be blinded by the sun and frozen in place. <--not even going to try to resolve that mixed metaphor. it's not a competition who has it worse, i know that. i just have been trying to get the full picture of what im up against here. i've had two fantastic, life-saving therapists but neither diagnosed me with bpd. when i discovered this forum a couple months ago i was overwhelmed that there were people like me. i posted my craziest sounding questions/experiences/thoughts a couple times, thought i may as well jump in the deep end, to see if these people really are like me and the responses were always along the lines of 'i had to read this twice to see if i had actually written it or someone else had'. i am percieving that it's different for all of us and that i am probably very lucky that i'm the kind of bpd who never gives up, i'm like a dog with a bone. it was scary to talk to my therapist about the discovery of what felt like multiple personalities. i told her that i didn't care about the diagnosis, i just needed a framework for understanding and parsing and approaching my disease. that finding out about bpd made me see what a game of whack-a-mole i'd been dealing with my whole life. she was still resistant to call it did or bpd but still helped me so much to pursue this line of attack. like, she runs interference for me, idk how to explain it. but, i think it's difficult for bpd people to realize what they are dealing with is some form of multiple identies because it's such a wall of noise. i always described myself as a wad of bubblegum lost under the bed, and there were dust bunnies stuck in there, maybe a bobby pin and a dime and a marble and other knds of random junk. i actually thought this was a hilarious way to describe it but idk that i ever got any sort of response to it. i always thought other people should find me a lot funnier than they seem to hahahhahaha. or they laugh at my 'b' material, the stuff that's not even that funny or incisive. anyway, i do crack myself up. that's all that matters (i tell myself when no one else laughs LOL)."
BPD,f2qdjep,t3_d7fhar,1570360053.0,Ah. I'm also American...
BPD,f2qdfwj,t3_d7fhar,1570359999.0,"Hahaha I know the fear after posting of wow I'm probably even too crazy for other people with BPD. I also found the perfect career, technical writing, which flourishes under a BPD person's obsession to figure everything out. I did really well in high tech and kept telling people what a great life it is to be well paid for indulging your obsessive personally, letting it run happily rampant. And it was. I retired, sold my house, gave everything else away, and now I just travel the world, sitting in outdoor cafes and writing plus seeing all kinds of crazy amazing places and people lol. I do think I would not have any of this without BPD. Otoh I would not recommend BPD to anyone who wants to have these glorious things like freedom and enough money to wander at will lol. It's fucking hard. 

 After I read your post I realized this is the flair I should stick to because it's overwhelming to read about all the pain. I know how unreachable I was all those years of the worst pain and it's so frustrating to not be able to help and also so irritating to hear so many people seem to be giving up, sorry but it is. But I would have heard anything along the lines of don't give up as 'snap out of it' which was always so demeaning to hear so I just don't say anything, hard for a motor mouth like me. Plus, I still need to learn how to help myself rather than dissipate myself all the time trying to help other people."
BPD,f2qbkmr,t1_f2pwmu0,1570359063.0,"Sad endearing and kinda hilarious. Well, I guess that 'endearing' includes hilarious. I ask them why, to protect me, they have to be so mean. The answer is always basically 'bitch darling, because that's the only way you will hear us. You seem to respond only to unbearable pain.' I do think this is the key. Also I can only respond with hmmm fair enough. I started to notice at some point that for all the years of intense loneliness, it was actually me abandoning myself. I asked myself what someone could actually do to help me feel connected because it seemed like some people wanted to be but I had to keep testing them and I couldn't stop. I realized I was terrified of someone actually seeing me, which is what I was always desperate to feel, that whatever love I could dimly percieve just made me feel like a deer in the headlights. Hence the realization that I was probably the abandoner. Not that I had any idea what to do about that. I felt so depressed. 

They say BPD can be caused by extreme neglect. When I was little, like tiny, I know the neglect and the mocking and publicly being humiliated, especially when I had shone at something like a solo at the Christmas concert or whatever other ways kids get to shine, was so shameful and painful that I consciously decided to never ever show anyone how I felt about anything or that I wanted or cared about anything. In spite of that I went on to accomplish a lot, but whatever I accomplished, I sabotaged at the most important moment. It felt out of control and that was really scary each time. 

If the trauma of neglect, granted, psycho neglect, caused a split, it seems possible that that little me who split has been crying for some attention and caring all this time and so, yeah, I'd scream if I were her, too lol. It's funny because she is me. 

It doesn't get resolved now like in a movie, where we talk about it and there's forgiveness and we go merrily forth. There are major trust issues. But it feels like it's worth a million bucks that I can hear them. I asked how many and they said 183. Idk if I am making that up but that sounds about proportionate to the noise level I've dealt with all my exhausting life. I still don't know how to connect to people but when it first struck me I could have multiple personalities without the blackouts etc, the song from a chorus line was so loud in my head and didn't go away. The lines 'one step and suddenly nobody else will do. You know you'll never be lonely with you know who'. I thought wow either I'm crazy to listen to this or my personalities are both desperate and hilarious. It kept getting louder and louder. That's when I started writing. I suppose this was my equivalent of your dream  It has helped me know when I am splitting. The writing is like, i write something, I feel stupid pretentiousness guilty for thinking I can write this or fix it or understand anything about it, as usual, then i write the insults I'm hearing down, some understanding of them comes into view but is immediately overpowered by new insults and terror and I struggle to express/pathetically defend myself against them, which is exactly like every conversation I have ever had with my parents, until I get what's going on and I write those new insults which brings on more from yet another direction, but I write those too. I've been doing this for a year. I've never before been able to do anything like this for more than a few weeks aka try to see who I am. Now those notebooks are my best friend.

BPD,f2ecqf2,t3_d7tgbf,1570191174.0,"Oh thank you for responding. One thing I wanted to add was that it is possible to find a good career even while you have this disease. That's not obvious at all because it ruins everything so I wanted to stress that. Graphic design also sounds like a great thing for you to pursue even though now you are at the point of loving it lol. I say this because it can lead to something called ux research, ux stands for 'user experience' and it's about finding out how people use a site or a product bthe objective is to help engineers make things easier for people to use. I think it's also a good job for BPD because we have a hyper awareness of how other people feel, everything they feel except for anything to do with if they care about us,v that part makes us blind... I want to impress that when you find the right job in high tech, you don't have to be around people at all. My ex husband worked at Apple and one of his co-workers was agoraphobic, lived thousands of miles from the apple campus and never left his house but no one cared about that, they just treated him like anyone else, admiring his work when it was good and getting annoyed at him when it wasn't. Also, I never disclosed my illness at work.  even though I realized it was safe, I couldn't let myself do it but I still wanted to let you know that there's a place for people like us. Good luck!

I found that odd but I have also noticed in myself a resistance to healing or hearing about possible ways to heal. I wonder whether it's because I'm actually terrified that nothing can heal me so it's better to avoid any possible solutions and not find out that they don't work, or that if I healed'my BPD I just wouldn't know who I am, at least the disease is something even though it's basically completely terrible, or whether I'm just what my voices say I am, a big fat self centered drama queen... I wondered if the positivity, with no sense if phoniness, was scary and that's why no one else responded. Idk but I am glad I'm lucky enough to be in a space to be able to relate to it. Lol"

BPD,f2e6ggp,t3_d7fhar,1570183508.0,"This is brilliant. 

I feel the same sorts of things in a huge way. I have been able to sort of honor my whatever the BPD version of alters is called by writing, like, just writing down what they are basically screaming at me the best that I can. I think the writing is what you said, honoring without reacting to them. It's as if how much more time the physical act of writing requires compared to thinking, which gives them free reign to stampede constantly... The act of writing makes it possible to hear them. It's chaotic and rushed because mine all want to talk at once.  It feels weird as if I am making it up when I write aka I'm really a lunatic, but then I write that down too and it turns out to be another one of them bombarding me trying to be heard. 

No matter how mean any of them is, it always turns out to my continual surprise that they are just trying to protect me. I get mad that they are so heavy handed about it, that what they call 'protection' feels worse than the original trauma but they have actually been able to explain that, too. 

What I wanted to say is that it looks to me like yours felt like it's safe to give you a clue about how to deal with them, which would have to be a clue about how to eventually heal from BPD. That some really hard and earnest work that you had the courage to do made them decide to take a big chance and reveal something about themselves to you, made them willing to test the waters and see if it might be safe to come out of hiding  They decided to reach you in a dream because, at least it's the case with mine, they can't trust you enough to tell you rationally? Or they are too immature to know how to tell you rationally because they broke off early in life when the trauma happened (one by one as different traumatic things happened?) And stayed the age you were when they split from you? These are the things that I constantly feel I am discovering as I write and that I question but also, I keep writing because it's like I have to. I feel like mine want to get back on the clock, the 'growing up' clock that ticks naturally for people who get to grow up without trauma or whatever it is that caused me to split so many times. 

The other thing I wanted to say is that sometimes they are breathtakingly funny or sort of witty. They communicate in the form of a song stuck in my head which I find annoying until I listen to the words and realize the words are relevant to something I have been feeling, but in an oblique or even silly way. Usually just one line of a song which feels more annoying than having a whole song or a verse stuck there. By oblique or silly I mean something like it's a song about romantic love but they send it almost as a pun about me loving or hurting (from a sad love song) myself or something about something my mother, the trauma inflictor, did, so I don't get their meaning at first. I wanted to ask whether you had any similar sense from your dream that your alters also have a sense of humor. I try to be funny a lot, and actually am funny and clever a lot (which otoh I simply enjoy but on the other hand makes me end up feeling like I have tricked people into liking me therefore I don't want to see them again). It's breathtaking, though, to feel like my alters maintained the ability to have a sense of humor beneath all the torture they inflict on me and must be feeling themselves. A gentle sense of humor, as if that's a clue to who I really am. 

Sorry for the avalanche of me me me lol. I've not been able to to talk about this even though it feels so exciting to have made some headway. Interested to hear your further thoughts. Also want to thank you for your post."

The image that helps me get to where I can think it through is: if someone backed their car out of the garage and unknowingly ran over you breaking both your legs, you will limp whether they did it on purpose or not. That at least brings me back to to 'how can I learn to walk like this', rather than wondering whether I am crazy and a big phony because I am limping. Whatever happened, that was my experience and that's what I need to resolve. Idk why we tend to feel so guilty about our pain but we really do."
BPD,f29ev9y,t1_f2912ce,1570094807.0,I relate to this! Especially the last paragraph. You put it perfectly.
BPD,f29etin,t3_dcklry,1570094746.0,"Yes I have felt my whole life like I am shouting and screaming in the library and no one even looks at me. I feel desperate to know what allows them to be silent and what they know that I don't. Thank you for sharing this! The first time a therapist made me feel like ah, okay, so there actually is some sound coming out of my throat when I talk--someone besides me heard it, too! I kind of freaked out. What I couldn't understand was, if he could hear me, how come no one else could? I hadn't been exclusively screaming about the fire my whole life, I'd also said funny, profound, interesting, relavent, and mundane things, etc but always felt invisible either because no one responded or their response had nothing to do with what I had said.  I asked him how it was possible that he heard me when no one else ever had in 42 years, whether I was actually some sort of drama queen who was so busy complaining about feeling invisible that I was the one couldn't hear anyone else. He answered , 'i think this is going exactly how it should. I am able to help you and we won't stop working together until you feel healed' something like that, and I was again a little amazed that that response made me feel heard. And then he did what he promised, for five years, then he died... I still have BPD and I still struggle but he definitely managed to make my life not feel like torture any more."
BPD,f246a8h,t1_f1tqbf3,1569945658.0,"you captured my 20s exactly. they say you can't remember pain--i remember that horrible pain but have never been able to adequately describe it. i'm 64 and i want to tell you it gets better but i don''t know how to do that so you will believe me, esp because i still post about my pain in this group. if someone had tried to tell me in my 20s that it gets better i would have just thought they didn't know what real pain was, that they couldn't see how hopeless i was, what kind of demons a person can have inside of them, and what a catch-22 mental illness is. my 20s were the worst and reading your response has made me see how much less horrible my life has become. each decade actually got a little bit better. in my 20s, it was worst when i had PMS, which i could never identify at the time, but it became clear because often when i got my period, a thought would flood my head like 'oh! i don't have to kill myself!' or 'oh, i won't end up in a mental hospital.' it was as unbidden as suicidal ideation. often i didn't even realize til that moment that i had been thinking about killing myself or that i would be committed, i just knew i'd been desperately running from some fear and when that moment of clarity happened, it replayed in my head like a fast motion movie. finally i figured out that one symptom of my PMS was the inability to realize it was PMS even though it happened basically every month. idk if you are female, but if you are, it might help to look at your cycle when the ideation is the worst? but here's what i really wanted to tell you: as i said, i actually found a career that dovetailed with my bpd and i became very successful and financially independent. i mentored a lot of young people and became really good at helping people get on their best career path. so, i'll take a chance on doing that with you. I think, from what you wrote, that you might do very well as a project manager. it might just gel with the intensity of your bpd and become an outlet for you. this may sound weird, but the way you can see your life going, which is negative, granted (not trying to tell you to be more positive or 'snap out of it!', which i hate when people tell me or imply)--but you followed a solid line of logic and could see many steps ahead. this is a rare-ish skill and well suited to project management, which requires a lot of skills that not many people have. it's a skill to be able to consider what could go wrong and logically see the possible outcomes of that. you are also articulate, which is another strong project manager skill. i worked in high tech and i know that at high tech companies project managers are always in demand and that it is VERY well paid. plus, all sorts of odd people work in high tech--software engineers are famous for having ocd and being on the autism spectrum (not all of them but it's a high incidence). one of my coworkers told me how he had cried without knowing why through his job interview but he got hired anyway because somehow they were able to look beyond his odd behavior to see his passion. i was able to feel like i fit in there better than any other environment i'd ever been in and i didn't discover it til my 50s so it was a loooooooooong search that always felt hopeless. i was a waitress until i was 40. part of the comfort was realizing that no one would think it was weird when i felt like i didn't fit in. idk if you already know any of what i'm telling you but if not, i wanted to present this possibility to you. you gave me something with this description of having bpd in your 20s, i wanted to give you something back. also, you mentioned the fear of your friends outgrowing you as their careers progress. there are lots of different kinds of project management so if one doesn't suit you you can try others. you can start out with a certificate but many go on to get MBAs. my company paid 12k/year in tuition for anyone who wanted to get an mba, which put it in reach for a lot of people. bpd gives people high intelligence, i believe, because we have so much to try to figure out all the time and because all the different voices force us to try to figure out things from so many angles, and the ability to do that is one powerful form of intelligence. this not only makes us good at complex jobs, it also makes being in high tech fun because you're around other highly intelligent people all the time. i hope you will look into this career path and if it suits you or engages you, it doesn't matter how slowly you pursue it. what happens when you find a suitable career path is, if you find parts of it boring, you will actually come up with ways to sort of make the process your own, almost along the lines of moving the field forward a nanometer or whatever. It's subtle but it's satisfying to feel like you could push something rather than being pulled and dragged all the time. getting financially stable, then comfortable, then independent, makes having bpd a lot less scary. you could look at the job pages for google, facebook, apple, reddit, twitter, etc., and see if any of the job descriptions resonate with you, then figure out what kinds of classes or programs and internships you should pursue. just a suggestion. career stuff is the one thing i have really figured out in my life. project management may sound boring before you understand it but it's actually a very creative job because it's constant problem solving and requires juggling lots of variable and possibilities. when you engage in this but not in the context of fighting your demons, it's actually pretty fun and amazing. i wasn't a project manager but i worked with lots of them and each one was so different, most of them were sort of neurotic lol but generally they were admired as they did their thing. you get the feeling that you are creating your own job, which i think is a good thing for someone with bpd. you don't feel restricted or trapped or like you have to be someone you are not. it's like your company and your boss say 'here's what has to get done, do whatever you think it takes to get it done and if you have any questions or problems, we are here to help you figure them out.' i hope this helps or at least gives you some ideas. in case you fear you wouldn't fit it, my company actually had a two-day mental health symposium with presentations by someone with DID talking about their personalities and how they relate to each other how much info they share with each other, etc. (they were a bald male in their 50s with long hair and dressed like a woman. no one bats an eye at people like this in high tech companies); someone with bipolar disorder; someone who had been committed to a mental hospital by his family and wanted to explain that it wasn't horrible because he actually needed to be rescued and what the experience was like--he'd had to take a leave of absence for several months but his job had been waiting for him when he was ready to return; someone with intrusive thoughts who talked about how she'd tink of stabbing a friend or other things, unbidden thoughts that reminded me of suicidal ideation, and how she finally was able to find the right kind of therapist with recommendations for finding your own if it seems like no one can help you; someone with clinical depression for whom no meds had worked who wanted to talk about how psychedic drugs are being experimented with for ptsd and depression and how she was working with her psychiatrist to see if they would help her aka she was taking lsd but still managing to do her job; lots of other individuals, but the presentations that struck me most deeply were two panel discussions: one was given by 4 people with mental illness and their managers, talking about how they revealed their illness to their manager and then the managers talking about how they learned how to best manage these people to make them feel safe at work and also help them be most productive and find job satisfaction and basically work around their illnesses be it working from home some of the time or other things, it was different for different people. the other was given by people from HR who talked about the resources the company provided, on-site therapists, programs that paid for non-onsite therapists, how it was illegal for a company to fire you due to your illness, and disability insurance, which everyone automatically gets but the preso was how to take advantage of it and how to talk to your doctor to have them help you make a claim if you need time off. the insurance pays about 60% of your salary but it's tax free so you bring home about the same amount as when you were working. i was on disability for one year. can you imagine feeling like you can announce to anyone in the company what your mental illness is, that a company would encourage this so that others might feel more comfortable dealing with their disease? idk that i would have had the guts to give a talk but it really helped me to watch the seminar live stream from home. there really are places out there for people like us and the work can be extremely satisfying. this is the world of high tech. it's like hogwarts lol."
