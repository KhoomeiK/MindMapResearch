Back at my first delivery job I worked at a sandwich shop on a college campus that was open until 3:00 am. On this night, I delivered to a sketchy smoke shop downtown and off campus that had an upper level and a basement where underground parties would happen after their official hours. 

I’m taking a delivery to Tyler the creator (yes, no shit and they told me so when they placed their order). The total is $22. and some change and they want to pay cash. They ordered 2 sandwiches and 4 kool aids. 

So I get there and I’m talking to the dude who placed the order and he says to hold on just a minute cause someone else is coming down with the money. No sweat, him and I are just hanging out for a minute and shooting the shit. After a minute or two, Tyler the creator and another dude come out and I hand them the sandwiches as they’re getting money. I shit you not Tyler himself says “we only got a $20, is that cool?” I say “no the total is $22.50.” He asks what we can do about this and I say “I’ll have to take back 2 of your 4 kool aids, would you like both grapes, both cherries or one of each?” They’re all pretty shocked and I kind of am too as I’m usually pretty awkward and not quick witted. Ultimately they decided on one of each and I got a $.50 tip because I don’t carry coin and couldn’t make change for them.

Get some bigger alcohol wipes or Clorox wipes to wipe the bag down afterwards to ensure it’s sterile. Also, make it a habit to wipe down everything you touch in your car after every run to ensure your safety and the customer’s. I’m also dating the bag that all my tips and mileage goes in at the end of everyday and putting it in 4 day quarantine at home. 

Should you have to buy your own supplies to ensure that you and the customer’s safety is maximized within reason? No you shouldn’t, but it’d be kind of dumb not to do at this point. If you’re that broke, ask your manager if you can use a bag of bottle condoms for this purpose. You can also probably keep a sanitizer rag in a grocery bag in your car to wipe stuff down if you can’t afford or find alcohol wipes. Just make sure you get new sanitizer on it every hour or so. 

This isn’t fair. It’s not fair to anyone whose still working and anyone whose sick. But we’ve got to adapt and rise to the occasion. I know it’s against policy, but you can ask for tips in such a way that it’s not pushy and you won’t get complaints. I’m not allowing anyone to touch my pen and am asking them if they’d like to leave a tip on the card, and if so are they comfortable with me writing it in for them or leaving cash under their mat. I always preface that with “you don’t have to leave a tip”. I’ve been averaging what I was averaging before all of this, at least for the last week.

On top of making a decent wage, I have to consider future car repairs since I’m doubling what my car’s mileage would be.
