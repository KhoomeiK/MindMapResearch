BPD,fn70fd5,t3_fzwrh9,1586710874.0,People always fall in love w me so hard and so fkn fast. It's so obnoxious most times. But ive been seeing this girl who really didnt and usually it takes like 2 weeks lmao. But this girl its been 2 months and shes said she loves me but like. Its not the same as it usually is. Its really interesting to me. Although i have made people fall for me out of boredom its not common for me

lgbt,fma48uf,t3_fu03fp,1585883432.0,Same fknn boat tbh my mom used to be all for gay rights. Suddenly found god again and decided god is sending me to hell lmao which is shitty because im religious. She literally went to our preist and everyrhing abt me. She literally used to tell my ex fiance she didnt want me to be with her because we were going to hell. Shits FUCKED. live your life though. It fkn hurts that they wont support you butü§∑üèªsome things you cant control
BPD,fma423i,t3_fu06oo,1585883298.0,I totally relate to the begining of this. The feeling of not wanting them but also like. Wanting them? Weird shit tbh. Idk why I ever felt like that. We were engaged and together for almost 3 years. And somehow i also always knew it wouldnt work but that level of comfort is so hard to walk away from. It feels wrong. But you know logically its not.
BPD,fma3mlx,t1_fm9i6i8,1585882989.0,Ya idk if I'll ever get used to that feeling
BPD,fma3l8t,t1_fm9n2r4,1585882961.0,Good point
depression,fm8yusl,t1_fm8ym1g,1585858552.0,If its connectingg w people go to a nursing home. Theyre really in need and it makes you feel like ur rlly making a difference. Its as easy as calling and asking abt volunteer opportunities :)
depression,fm8ydig,t1_fm8y7wy,1585858307.0,Then find soemthing that makes your brain go jsnnskdjnfnd lmao. Dont let it b a person. Fuck w like volunteering or sum. You can find things in common with coworkers or volunteers that make you feel connected to that job or act and make you rlly wanna be alive to keep doing it. Shelters for example
selfharm,fm8y4nw,t3_ftslqx,1585858177.0,Yess bby
depression,fm8y0ww,t3_ftsqc0,1585858122.0,There is online texting therapy. Ask if your therapist would be interested in something like that ebcause some things have developed and you feel you need help
depression,fm8xnu2,t3_ftsx7q,1585857933.0,Just because you dont have a reason outside of yourself doesnt mean you dont have an obliguation to yourself to show the world what your capable of. Make your reason to wake up to impress yourself with your will to live lmao. ü§∑üèªyour the only one that matters

BPD,fm8qngr,t1_fm8pu1m,1585854215.0,Glad im not the only one lmao. I honestly find its not worth it for me personally. I'm such an emotional person that the concept is terrible. Let alone living it.
sociopath,fm8g86y,t3_ftll5f,1585848835.0,"Depending what the job is for you can go the entirely different route. Stick out by actually telling them, younger along great with colleagues, work ethic is phenomenal and your really excited to just get to work. Explain how impressed theyd be with the work you do and manipulate this information in a way that sounds enticing to take the focus off of you personally. And give them more of what you can do for them. Pretend you feel inferior to them. Get in their head and switch the roles."
sociopath,flhrf0n,t1_fle6d4p,1585168094.0,Love blinds people. They genuinely love you.
lgbt,flch7hz,t3_fnu1eg,1585030741.0,Agreed
aspd,fl9asw5,t1_fl9aojm,1584947423.0,Thanks so much hunüôÉ i try my fkn best lmao üòÇ
aspd,fl9a0eg,t1_fl99pb5,1584946493.0,"Thats great:) the woman im trying to cultivate a relationship with I feel like may look at it similarly. She has said she cares for me and it sounds like im in alot of ways really similar to your wife. Ive been telling her since she told me about her diagnosis that just because she says she ""loves differently"" never means that its wrong. Every love is different. Everythings going well. I just feel like i really needed an insight as to how it may or may not develop. Just other opinions and peoples expiriences who may have similar expiriences as her is eye opening. Thanks for the responseüôÉüôãüèª"
Vent,fl98rv1,t3_fn3tde,1584945123.0,I used to feel this hella hard. Its shit. Work hard on it and it'll improve
aspd,fl8o3us,t3_fn3l7b,1584928209.0,"Do you feel love with your wife? If so, how does it feel for you?"
