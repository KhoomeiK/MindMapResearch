I would fall asleep as soon as I got home because all of my energy had been expended just being out in the world.

Katatonia,foitnnh,t3_g72ajc,1587796644.0,"What draws me to particular Katatonia songs is usually a combination of lyrics with an emotional hook and ""moments,"" like a really heavy breakdown. Doesn't have to have both, just one or the other. However, I generally like their songs that don't have these elements just for that Katatonia sound/atmosphere.

On my first listen to City Burials, the only song that really hooked me was Lacquer. I had it on repeat when it was first released and it was because the lyrics resonated with me. So far, the other songs on the album are good (although I don't care for Behind the Blood as I think it sounds nostalgic for something that I'm not), but there aren't very many ""moments"" or lyrics that really punched me in the gut. They all have that Katatonia sound that I like, so I'll happily listen to them when they cycle through a playlist, but other than Lacquer, they're not instant favourites that I'd specifically play.

The songs will probably stand out differently when I'm in different moods or headspaces, so there may be other favourites on there yet, but for now I'll be happy with the Katatonia ambiance."

Fantasy,fnm4ijv,t3_g2dcab,1587064956.0,"So many, but the first one that came to mind was this scene/quote from The Last Unicorn:

""*When I was alive, I believed - as you do - that time was at least as real and solid as myself, and probably more so. I said 'one o'clock' as though I could see it, and 'Monday' as though I could find it on the map; and I let myself be hurried along from minute to minute, day to day, year to year, as though I were actually moving from one place to another. Like everyone else, I lived in a house bricked up with seconds and minutes, weekends and New Year's Days, and I never went outside until I died, because there was no other door. Now I know that I could have walked through the walls.*""

This quote helped free me from a lot of my anxiety. Society has a lot of expectations around how time works. Work a 9-5. It's only acceptable to do X until or after a certain age. ""Spare time"" is yours, the rest belongs to the cog. When something makes me anxious or unhappy, it's nice to think, ""Wait, I can walk through the walls."" I can work towards changing it. I don't have to follow society's timeline or sit inside any box. This can be larger-scale things, like finding a job that works better for your ideal schedule or going back to school at 40, but even in day-to-day life, knowing that, technically, if something becomes too much, you can walk away, helps me a lot. Sometimes just knowing that you have a choice makes everything bearable.

The other side of the coin is the lesson from A Wizard of Earthsea: ""*To light a candle is to cast a shadow.*"" You can walk through the walls, but every one of your actions has a consequence, positive or negative, so you still have to think carefully about where to tread.

I think together these two lessons help keep me balanced between flightiness and responsibility."

Fantasy,fjdwxxi,t3_fclxza,1583260851.0,"I can relate to a lot of what you wrote! This is a very interesting question. I do think reading and fantasy has shaped a lot of us.

I also had trouble reading, but because of my shyness. We learned how to read in Grade 1, but the teacher liked to make us read words off the board in front of everyone. I still remember her calling on me to read one of the words and I didn't know it. I think I guessed five or six similar words (""cat?"" ""car?"" ""can?"") and she just let me keep getting it wrong until I felt like reading was just an exercise in public shaming.

My mom worked with me at home so I could read in a comfortable environment and then it really took off. By the end of that year, I was always reading way above my grade level and it stayed that way. Reading became my identity. I'd stay up late reading, sometimes with a flashlight under the covers.

I squirreled away my dad's copy of The Hobbit when I was eight and fell in love with fantasy. Then that became an identity too. Fantasy EVERYTHING was my passion. Games, art, writing, all of it. When I got my hands on Harry Potter (also before the first movie came out!), that series more than anything defined my childhood reading habits. I don't think anything will ever capture the sense of excitement on the day of a Harry Potter book release!

I did not have many friends and later, as a teen, I had none when it mattered. But I had Bilbo, and the Fellowship and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and reading was still my biggest escape. My teenage favourites were the Bartimaeus Trilogy, The Name of the Wind, the Books of Pellinor, and the Abhorsen series. My dad is also a big reader of fantasy, so we shared and talked a lot about books, which was a nice way to bond. As a teen, I also spent a lot of time playing MMORPGs, especially Dungeons and Dragons Online.

But that was all before smartphones and wifi.

The biggest bullet to my bookish identity and reading journey has been technology. I struggle with the addictive nature of the internet, so often I'll fall asleep with my nose in a Reddit thread or a Netflix binge instead of a book. I haven't had much luck breaking that bad habit, but I still feel like books and fantasy worlds are who I am. I still read a fantasy book about once a month or two, my travels and university studies all stem from my interest in fantasy/mythology/conlangs/Tolkien/etc., and my early love of reading shaped my career in editing. I can honestly also say that ""reading fantasy has made me who I am."""

She said that at that level, I could be at risk of miscarriages and fertility issues in the future, and she wants to try to bring it down.

Fantasy,feizivz,t3_epcos9,1579151678.0,"**Last book finished:** Ka: Dar Oakley in the Ruin of Ymr by John Crowley

As far as I'm aware, this is a standalone fantasy/historical fiction novel about an immortal crow and all of his exploits in the land of Ymr, which is the world of humans, from pre-history to some unknown modern or future date. It reads almost like listening to a storyteller and incorporates a lot of animal motifs, philosophical questions/debates, discussions of death, and some pretty neat adventures. I quite liked it, particularly Dar Oakley's interactions with ancient peoples, but I lost a little interest the closer he got to the modern era. 

**Currently reading:** Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock

I'm within the last 100 or so pages of this book and have mixed feelings about it. I am in love with the premise, the setting, and the epistolary elements/journal entries as a storytelling device, but so much of it went off track from what I was expecting that it lost a little of its magic for me (e.g., I can't remember the exact quote, but it was similar to ""child-like sexuality""...nope!).

They were solely arbiters of grades and extension givers, and I felt unworthy of talking to them about anything else.

This lasted for four years. When I took a small summer class, my world view completely shifted because our prof sat at a table with us to teach.

As the other poster said, you could also work in related jobs. I think a boarding kennel (e.g., for people who need to leave their dogs while on vacation) would be a big hit if started by someone who is a certified dog trainer. I know some adoption centres also hire (or use volunteers) as adoption counsellors to help people pick the right dog for them, which sounds like it would match your interests."
findapath,f74hbq6,t3_duaty1,1573402415.0,"“Has anyone ever experienced anything similar and successfully changed degrees or found other ways to learn about their unfulfilled passions?”

My story might be similar/helpful as an idea on how to incorporate design into your life after graduation. I graduated with a major in a social science because it seemed like a good idea as a springboard into a few different grad programs, but I didn’t overly care about the topic. What I did care about was really dorky and unpractical—medieval history. 

After I graduated, I worked part-time in an unrelated minimum wage job, and re-enrolled at my university as a “continuing student” in the faculty of extended education. After that, I started taking one class a semester in the topics I actually found interesting. I fell in love with learning medieval history, as I knew I would, and forged really strong connections with some professors in the department, who have since gone on to recommend me for jobs, brought me onto their summer projects, etc. 

It is three years later and I am STILL taking one class a semester despite now working full time (in a job those professors were my references for)—and it’s for me and my happiness, even if it’s looked down on as “unpractical” from society’s standpoint, which is why I did not pursue it as my major at the time.

So, just because it wasn’t your major or you can’t pivot into grad school right away, you can definitely continue to develop your interest and skills in design while you build up a portfolio, even after you graduate. I definitely recommend talking to an academic advisor about extended ed/continuing studies (or even auditing). 

I’m 100% sure that if you are passionate about design, you will find a way to incorporate it into your future—and your background in another field will help you stand out and see things from a fresh perspective."
findapath,f72a1eu,t3_dtya37,1573356744.0,"It sounds like you're on the right track! You identified some paths for yourself already. Here are some things that stood out to me:

- Since you're saving money by living at home, if you're currently working full time, you could go down to part time at your store, since you like the work, you just need more time to focus on forging your next step.

- You mentioned teaching--you could make some extra money by teaching online with your BA. You GPA doesn't matter, just the fact that you have a degree and presumably are a native English speaker. There are a lot of companies that need teachers for children in China (e.g., VIPkid, Qkid), so the hours are mostly nights, and you can work as often or as little as you choose. This would also be a good way to see how you like teaching and if you want to pursue it as a career.

- If you're interested in getting those certifications, it seems like a good time.

- If you're worried about a sparse resume and the job market, you could try volunteering (maybe even in the field), which would be a good way to passively network. I imagine also that if you were to take those certifications, an option might be to do a work co-op, which would help with finding a job after certification.

I was also going to make a post about my experience for people who are very introverted and experience anxiety or need to take extra time to become comfortable in a situation. How neat that we were traveling at the same time in the same country! 

I actually found Dublin delightfully different to my smaller Canadian city. Maybe I’ll still make a post about my experience and how it went."

Thanks for your response!"

Thanks for the tip about asking people when there! I’ll definitely do that."
FemaleHairLoss,ewe067r,t1_ewdopbp,1565311452.0,"Your reply made me tear up! I wish we weren’t experiencing this, but I’m glad that we can share stories and that you signed up to write back. I also feel less alone—it’s deceiving when you’ve always had very thick hair, because it’s more easily dismissed by other people. I’m scared that it’s going to be dismissed until it gets to a point that’s undeniable (and there’s nothing I can do anymore) or it’s all gone.

That sounds awful, the up of thinking it was working, just to have more fall out. Hopefully it’s a trend towards less fall! I’d also be scared of taking medication, but it seems like it’s necessary, and hopefully outweighs the bad! Are you worried about other side effects?

My eyebrow hairs don’t seem to be affected, but the area right around my front part is the worst. It has some long leftover strands amidst a bunch of short broken pieces, so in the wind just that long weird bit floats up, and I don’t know which way to brush it. It looks like a combover either way and you can see my scalp through that whole area.

Good luck at your dermatology appointment! Are you expecting a diagnosis or just hoping to get a prescription? I’ll have to look into seeing one if it continues. I just don’t know how long to leave it. 

I’m 26, so I just didn’t think this could happen."

I guess the pictures can’t really capture exactly how thin it is now—putting my hand up to push my hair behind my ear gives me a jolt since it feels SO different. I would say 3/4 of the volume/thickness is completely gone all over, with the “bangs” area most thin and short/breaking off. I’ll look into castor oil."

findapath,ev1j6ek,t3_chzkgp,1564159500.0,"Hi! you seem to have a lot going for you (interest in hobbies, clear goals, a degree, well-rounded). I think you answered your own question! The game plan that most sticks out to me in your post is going to Korea to teach English. Your degree will come into play (not a waste at all), since certain certifications in teaching English as a second language require a bachelor's degree, you can live independently, and also learn the language. It seems like you're at the perfect stage in your life to make this happen. 

You could browse /r/TEFL/ for more guidance on the process.

Good luck!"
findapath,ev1gch5,t3_ci3hid,1564157874.0,"Hi fellow Canadian! I'm also trying to find a path. I think that you should pursue your interests, regardless of if they make you more money or turn into a career. Here are my thoughts on your post:

1. You say that you moved in April--that's not a very long time ago. Could you be homesick and not remembering that the grass really isn't as green as you remember it back home? If you think it could just be the newness, maybe you could try to settle in for awhile longer before making a decision to move back. 

2. You say that you work long hours with no time to train and very little time off, as well as being physically ""mangled."" Is that sustainable over a long period of time? Did you have a time commitment in mind for the farming work? You make about $50,000 a year with no schooling/debt, so it could be good to save money from this position over a short period, but it doesn't seem like something that could be a 20+ year career. Given that, it seems to me that taking on debt to go back to school is actually an investment in your future for when you can't physically do farming work anymore (or even just can't handle the long hours anymore).

3. You'll be 29 anyways. You can be 29 with no schooling or 29 with a newly minted degree. University programs are expensive, but nothing like you hear about in the States. If you can save money now, you can mitigate your debt later, or even go back to school part-time while keeping up with judo and working a less stressful job more closely related to what you're interested in. There are also programs like massage therapy that are not as long as a full degree, but offer a good career. Or certificate programs for things like therapy assistants or trainers. 

4. I think that you could definitely make a career out of judo or at least incorporate it into your career. I have a friend who graduated with a Bachelor of Athletic Therapy who does work out of clinics, but also works mainly through her sport network (she's a powerlifter and provides services to her fellow lifters at and outside of competitions). If you become involved in the judo community, I'm sure that would be an excellent way to find clients and keep the sport in your life. Another person I know took their passion for dance and took it rurally, opening a successful dance studio to teach children beginner styles to then perform for their parents at the end of the year. I say rurally because cities already have established services and it might be more difficult to get started, but if you, for example, started offering judo classes to a municipality that doesn't have many options for their kids to be involved in sport, that could be a really rewarding way of staying near to nature and keeping judo in your life.

Hope any of that helps!"
fantasywriters,eurnfhn,t3_ch9d7s,1563996399.0,"If you haven't read Tigana by Guy Gavriel Kay, I think it would be a good place to see this sort of idea in motion. Here's a little description:

""It is the tale of a people so cursed by the dark sorceries of the tyrant king Brandin that even the very name of their once beautiful home cannot be spoken or remembered. But years after their homeland’s devastation, a handful of men and women set in motion a dangerous crusade—to overthrow their conquerors and bring back to the world the lost brightness of an obliterated name: Tigana."""
findapath,eur6jwk,t3_ch09gi,1563990184.0,"I don't have all the answers to finding a path, since I struggle with making decisions myself, but what I've found helpful in my own quest for future life paths is to sit down and write out a bucket list of sorts. This shouldn't be as mentally exhausting as brainstorming for specific jobs, since it's more about you as a person and what you really want to do with your time on earth. It doesn't have to be a complete list (I imagine it will change as you come to discover new goals or passions), but it will be a good start. Put small things (e.g., ""I want to try that new restaurant down the street"") and big things (e.g., ""I want to travel the country in an RV for six months"").

Then, based on that list, look for opportunities to engage with them. It doesn't have to be paid employment or school programs right away, but in your exploration of things on this list, I bet that you will find a direction that you didn't expect. 

For more specific examples, some goals I see based on your comments:

- find a job that doesn't involve warehouse work, traditional office space/9-5, or the video game industry

- speak to a career or educational counselor (just because the one at the community college didn't work out doesn't mean that there aren't other resources in your community that do this sort of thing)

- take a Spanish class 

That seems like a really solid start! If you research employment counselors in your area, make an appointment, and enrol in a Spanish class (even one that isn't offered in a college/university), then you're already making progress. Those could both lead to great opportunities for exploring personal and career goals."
AskAcademia,eu414s5,t3_cdef44,1563433373.0,"I have been taking courses from a certain lecturer for three years now and value their teaching highly (e.g., they always include undergraduate students as collaborators, go the extra mile to lend materials, and much more). They are not in a tenure track position, but a permanent instructor position with rungs. My understanding is that they are not on the highest rung and will have to make a case for a promotion of sorts eventually. My question is, if I were to nominate this individual for a teaching award, should I ask them first or would it be better as a surprise? If they are nominated, I think they have to spend time putting together course outlines, teaching dossiers, etc., which isn’t something I want to spring on them if it’s too time consuming at the moment. Thoughts? I’m also not sure if a single nominator would be embarrassing—is it meant to be in collaboration with their colleagues and other students? Thanks for any help!"
plantclinic,etw7qq9,t1_etw3iez,1563257225.0,"Thank you so much for replying! I’ve been in tears over this silly plant all evening. 

I replanted it in soil that I got from a dollar store, as the plant shop was out. I doubt it’s of any quality. If it will make a difference, I’ll try to find some specialty soil!

On the topic of moistness/overwatering—I’ve been under the impression that these sorts of plants weren’t supposed to be watered very much. I’ve been watering it maybe a half-teaspoon a week. Definitely not enough to have any sort of moistness issues or even needing any draining—and it’s definitely very dry and brittle feeling, not moist. Should I water it more than this, do you know? Could it lack root growth due to lack of water as well?"
harrypotterwu,ethck1b,t3_cbp4jx,1562811785.0,"1. I think the length of the event was just right. My plan to unlock the last of my two portkeys was foiled last night by pouring rain, which I tried to walk through anyways because I was worried about not finishing. It was fairly amusing and out of character—it made me feel like the event was giving me a prod to be more adventurous. And it turned out fine with the rest of the time left today (I appreciated that it didn’t end during the night). 

2. I had to go online to figure out why the same foundables were appearing over and over, which I initially found irritating, thinking there would be more variety. I know better for next time and it wouldn’t bug me that much a second time around, since it would be expected.

All in all, I had a lot of fun with this event! It kept me playing the game whereas I may have abandoned it with less reason to stay engaged. I really like the beanie, but also wanted a moving sticker/frame polish addition themed to the event and a badge."

I especially hate applause that a) comes after things that didn’t seem to require it, but some random decided to start and now the speaker has to pause awkwardly while people join in, 2) interrupts every item in a list instead of coming at the end, 3) repeats itself over and over for the same general idea (e.g., we have signalled our stump-flaps of appreciation for each graduate of 2019, why are we doing it again, and again...and we’re standing now?! Stop it!), 4) comes after things that genuinely did not take any talent or work (I don’t mean toddler “dance” recitals, but like, intermission announcements or the projector being turned on), 5) comes after something in which the people who did the thing aren’t even there to hear it (movie theatres...sports watched from a TV...just end it, my spine can only curl in unfounded disgust so much), and the worst of all, 6) that is meant to be for yourselves as an audience (e.g., “Give yourself a round of applause!” NO, dear god. It is undeserved accolades at its least harmful, but most irritating). 

I hate clapping."
