It's because I do not wear make-up, I don't really leave the house so don't get much sun, still have ""acne"" (getting better), still a virgin/act like a moron around men and pretty much everyone else (social anxiety), still wear glasses because I'm not responsible enough to wear contact lenses, a little overweight (chubby) and I think at this particular incident because I was with my mom, maybe.

We were at a party a few months back when people had parties... My mom and I sat with a few people we didn't know: a woman and her daughter-in-law immediately next to us. They were speaking, and I'm insufferably shy and quiet, and only joined in the conversation when the woman complained about not knowing how to do something on her phone. So my mom immediately turns to her and says ""give it to my daughter, she can fix anything!""

The woman is a couple of years older than my mom, her d-I-L seems maybe in her early to mid 30s. I grab the phone and the woman says, ""Kids these days! When I was your age, I was playing outside!"" I think that's a weird thing to say to a 25 year old (back then), and just laugh it off and don't say anything. I give it back, then she tells me I should go into IT, and I tell her that I actually am doing my masters in computer science.

The utter shock on their faces was hilarious. The D-I-L actually chocked, and held my hand and apologized for sitting there not even talking. She told me they both thought I was in middle school. Honestly, it's not a compliment. It just validates all my insecurities: I look like a child. I'm physically small, I'm kind of immature/shy/naive, and no man is ever going to find this appealing unless he deliberately seeks virginal girls. (which has happened, and it's gross) Not that I should measure my worth by what men find attractive, it's just a very big area of insecurity for me."

unpopularopinion,fpss8kl,t1_fpseapk,1588878745.0,"Definitely more women. By A LOT. 

I don't have many guy friends. Also, one thing I left out of this is the fact that I'm from the middle east, and it's actually illegal (like you can go to jail) to have sex before marriage - but out of the 10 friends I regularly associate with, I'm the only one who's never had sex. So people get around, no one cares, except abortions and awareness is not really available (unless you have $$$) and so I'm not risking it. No freaking way. So - it's not that weird to come across someone my age, especially as a woman, who's still a virgin. Many men from the middle east actually have this idea that they like their wife to be a virgin, because that means ""no one has touched her"" before them! But they fool around as much. It's just a whole thing that's not at all the conversation here. 

BUT, the few guys I do interact with either don't care or think of it in a weird sexual fantasy way. So yeah, I guess men are not as judgmental about this as women are. My girl friends insist I must gain experience, because at this point it's embarrassing. I don't disagree, and I don't feel like they're bullying me or anything - but it still hurts. I'm not living my life to find a man. I just wish they understand that. That's not my mission in life. It's fine if it's someone else's. 

I think I used the wrong word with worse. It's really not comparable. I understand that even this being talked about more frequently and in a mocking manner towards men in media means it's harder and more apparent. But it's not at all easy for women, either. It's just very different."

Not entirely what I wanted or chose, I'm far from religious, and I'm not repulsive looking. Just sever social anxiety, low self-esteem and apparently I give off gay vibes. I don't know if I'm full on gay (pretty sure I'm not), or bi or pan or whatever - and frankly, I don't give a damn. But a lot of my guy friends have mistaken my love for (who knew) masculine things as manly/gay. Like a straight woman can't be a programmer/into sci-fi/etc.

BUT, here's the thing: I have been shamed for this. I am shamed for this regularly, by my friends most of all.

I've never been in a relationship past the age of 14, and that relationship was just toxic all around since he was 21 and I was lying about my age -said I was 16- and he was shooting up in front of me, had no job, lived in his car, etc. The fact that he never pressured me into anything is still baffling to me, or I might just be blocking it all out! Anyways, I've never had a ""boyfriend"" after that. Or ever, since I don't like to count that as one.

People make fun of me, because if a woman is a virgin, something must be seriously wrong with her because - somehow, all dudes will fuck anything that moves, they just don't care as long as you have a vagina (and they're straight) and a pulse. So, it's like how fucking ugly or unattractive or messed up do you have to be as a woman that nobody has ever wanted to fuck you?

Also, I have an actual fear of getting raped before I lose my virginity - and saying that just sounds stupid, but it's so real. Like I don't want the first time a penis near me to not be my choice. I don't consider rape as sex, let's make that clear, but just... I want the first that goes in to be someone I love and care about. (Also, you could be raped by a partner, but let's not overthink this anymore)

I'm just saying... it happens to women, and it's even worse.

It's sort of more talked about for men, and it's associated with certain things. (like being a nerd! As if that's a bad thing) But with women, even if it's something that's talked about - it's in a creepy ""virginal innocent"" context or it's about being super religious... and none of those are untrue, but this could be a lot more complicated.

Change is hard, why would I actively seek hardship? But then imagine if I suddenly realize I have a kid that I'm responsible for, and have to keep alive. 

That forces me to get up and do something. That kind of external force is what's needed sometimes, and it's really hard to give yourself dad. That's basically the reason I asked my dad to kick me out. I'm obviously exaggerating, but I once asked him about it. I told him what it would take for him to pack my stuff and just kick me out.

She was the draw for me. (Anthony Hopkins as well, but ERW more) Her Dolores became a favorite of mine immediately. Her whole journey was amazing. She did carry the show, not just this last season (she was seriously THE best thing about season 3) but season 1 and 2. 

And it's not just celebrity or like as a brand-name; she's actually an amazing actress and I don't think anyone else could have captured all that Dolores has to offer like ERW has done. There's still so much they can do with this character, and I don't understand why they would waste precious screen time on Stubbs (sorry, he's a good comic relief sometimes) and Caleb and Maeve and board meetings at Delos when they could have just devoted more time to the few characters that have a lot of layers: William, Dolores and Bernard. 

That's my biggest issue with season 3. Given the limited number of episodes, they wasted a lot of time trying to build the world. I wish they would've built it ""better"" in the first and second season, so we didn't have to witness how the RICO app worked and how the military or whomever is fucking with outliers does this or Caleb visiting his mom at the hospital (after she literally left him)... Idk, I just feel like a lot of season 3 was wasted. 

From what I'm seeing on almost all the social media platforms and talking to friends - I have yet to come across someone who is ok with Dolores being killed off for good, as in, no more ERW. Almost all the comments on her last post on instagram and a lot of them on the official westworld account are saying they won't watch S4 without her. While excessive, I'm on the same page.

Honestly, I never found Maeve an interesting character past season 1. Heck, even season 1 Maeve wasn't all that interesting. I'd have much rather they followed Clementine's story about how she was working as a prostitute to send money back to her family, how she wanted to move some place cold, etc. I did like the idea of Maeve chasing this dream of escape, and a tiny bit her whole past with a daughter... but then this imaginary daughter became her whole thing, and nothing else mattered. I still enjoyed her parts because of Hector and Lee, though. 

Bernard stopped being interesting past season 1. Him in season 2 was just annoying. A malfunctioning machine, confused, distorted, making decisions just because - even though he knew nothing, and wasn't even stopping to think. For a piece of code that's supposed to be logical, Bernard was seriously emotional in all of season 2. 

The only other interesting character left was William... and well. I care about no one that's left. I don't give a shit about Holores. I don't give a fuck about Stubbs. I really don't like Bernard.

westworld,fota902,t1_forx57t,1588048363.0,"If we're looking at the hosts strictly in terms of pieces of code written to do specific tasks, then it doesn't make sense that any of them has ""free will"". I would consider free will to be something like: 

I see a red light, and I just want to decide what to do at that one red light. In my code this is the instruction: 

    def what_to_do(color):
         if color == 'red':
                stop()
        elif color == 'yellow':
                slow_down()
        elif color == 'green':
                continue_forward()
        else: 
                break_down_or_sth()

Free will is seeing your color being red, and you deciding to continue_forward! That's code that's not working, and you have no idea why it's not working. That's faulty code. So essentially, free will is not doing what you were told to do. How on earth can something written entirely in code do this? They can't, unless they're malfunctioning. So maybe Dolores is the only one ""going outside her loop"" (not working properly) because Arnold deliberately did something to her code. It is possible to change 'red' into 'green', so whenever the input is 'red' the code sees that as 'green'... but even that's still following the code, and not free will. Just, different from the norm. 

It's all very confusing if you want to get technical. And these are AI, so of course they're gonna learn and adapt and we probably don't know how they're doing it... but they've been given a fixed set of instructions, how are they doing other things? Unless they can write their own code, which I think Maeve can? Could perhaps, with those tablets? Or maybe Dolores hearing her own voice means she's writing new instructions for herself? So really she's not sticking to her previous code, but sticking to her new code that she's making up as she goes along? That might be able to explain it, but then again, how is she writing code that she wasn't programmed to write?"

Back when he was popular, I loved how he looked. He looked cute without trying. I don't know, that was the look I guess. All the guys from 1D had that same look. I remember Glee did an episode where everyone of the guys dressed up like JB. He was everywhere, and wasn't doing a lot of the nasty stuff he ended up doing. I was young, too but most of his fans were MUCH younger. Oh god, I remember Tumblr posts and people fighting on some crappy forum website over him. Girls literally self harming because he was sad... References to JB were everywhere (PLL, The Middle, etc). It's just what it was. I wore hoodies and even cut my hair similar to his. I'm a girl. I'm not gay. (Bi, but, not gay)

I was also 14 when Twilight came out, and every single friend of mine was either in love with Robert or Taylor. I was in love with Kristen Stewart. lol  

It was just a phase. Both of them. I grew out of that pretty quickly. In a couple of years, JB wasn't cool anymore. Every adult in my life hated Twilight, and made fun of me for even watching it. I hated it too, tbh... After a while, I started to actively seek out unknown movies and singers just because I wanted 20-somethings to not make fun of me. I had a lot of friends in their 20s when I was 17 (thanks to chatrooms) and they were relentless in making fun of my bad taste. I ended up listening to Radiohead (not that they're unknown) and watched Aronofsky movies. Just because I wanted to 20 year olds to think I was intellectual and mature. 

As a 26 year old, I've chosen never to make fun of someone's taste. So fucking what if I liked a Bieber song? I also loved Pink Floyd and my favorite band is Queen. I can appreciate all types of music. I listen to Cardi B and Lizzo, and I listen to classical music, and I listen to Steve Nicks and Heart. I love crap according to most people, multiple times (Mean girls, DUH, username) and I love Persona. It's possible to have a diverse taste and relate to different stuff. 

So, yeah, JB's music is technically not good. He's not a good role model. He's a bit whacky, even now. I very much dislike his wife. lol He shouldn't be as famous as he is. He should be so rich. He's an asshole. Blah blah blah. It's just a fun song, who cares, let the kids listen to it while you sing along to Dream On."
