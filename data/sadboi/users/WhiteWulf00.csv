SuicideWatch,fcpu692,t3_eieayu,1577872203.0,"Life‚Äôs a bitch.... I‚Äôm graduating college next winter but idk if I can keep on keeping on lol. Every day feels like a heavy struggle. My friends and I don‚Äôt really hang out anymore, I‚Äôve lost complete contact with my family besides my brother and mother, my mother is the most complicated woman alive, we‚Äôre poor as fuck which makes everything much more difficult (I get grants and scholarships for school), I don‚Äôt have a gf or someone that cares ab me really. My brother is always out with his fianc√© and my mother literally goes crazy on me for the littlest things. I literally feel like giving up hard. One of the only reasons I don‚Äôt kill myself is bc of the cost on my family to get rid of my dead ass haha. It‚Äôs the hardest when my mom tells me shit bc she‚Äôs the closest  thing to anyone caring ab me :/ those times are the worst. Someone come and like palpatine said ‚ÄúDo it!‚Äù

I just don‚Äôt want to exist."
