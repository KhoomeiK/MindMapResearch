I think it's important for you to remember that these images you're imagining of her are just that, imagined. My mum would use her vulnerability as a tool of manipulation to keep me in her life. Now that I'm not in contact with her, it's helped me gain a different perspective. If she is alone, crying by herself, it isn't because of you - this is the result of her behaviour, and she is facing the consequences of her actions.

The first few months of NC are really weird, but I can assure you it gets easier overtime and you deserve being able to exist without these feelings of guilt; you are a good person who deserves good things."

Sort of, regarding the average, but I wouldn't worry too much about first year grades. I got a 2:2 overall in first year and failed a module and they didn't seem to care haha. I think just generally they want to see someone who is a hard worker who has an upward trajectory (getting a 75 and an 80 in first year will defo look good though!) 

They understand that you won't do amazingly in every module, especially towards the beginning of uni. If you've got a solid proposal and you're averaging at a high 2:1 or a first, you're in a pretty decent spot of getting funding. That being said, a decent spot is still pretty dire, humanities funding sucks. You sound like you're doing all the right things though! I didn't research funding in time and it was a real oversight on my part. Make sure you check out the Ertegun scholarship and such.

Ticking echoed across the room. With only a desk and two worn, pigeon blue chairs, no attempt had ever been made to instill any kind of warmth or comfort in the area. It didn't seem to bother them, maybe they didn't notice it. 

This was their sixth appointment at the office. Spending a quarter of their take home pay on ""talking"" felt like an odd use of time, but the desperation to gain some clarity on the situation had grown too great to ignore. 

""Did you have a chance to think about what I said last week?""

The first two weeks had been spent divulging every detail of their life thus far. A couple of decades of life experience is not easily explained in two fifty minute sessions. The initial goal of the third week was distracted after a revelation- well a supposed one. Mistaken for a possible manic episode, the middle two sessions had been complicated with discussions surrounding delusions of grandeur, questions about psychosis, and the like.  A waste of time, a waste of money- both of them agreed, but it was necessary. 

Week five regressed back to three, and it was time for some homework. Take ten minutes every day for some mindfulness and learn to better understand your actions. Easier said than done, especially when your instincts- something that feels so natural- are what everyone seems to question. 

""Yeah, I did...I did it, you know, I mean, I took the time.. I timed myself actually, ten minutes. I just, I don't know, I wasn't really sure what I was actually meant to be thinking about? My day? It didn't make sense, sorry, I'm not trying to be unhelpful, but like, I didn't get it, I guess.""

""That's okay...what do you think you struggled with the most?""

Week four wasn't entirely useless. A conversation about their motivations had started before it was abruptly finished by the clock reaching 12:50. Truth be told, they felt a little annoyed about that.

""I don't know. How am I meant to know? About what you mean I mean. Why do I do things? What does that even mean? Just seems weird for that to be my focus... how does that help you figure out why I'm like this? Sorry. Sorry. I'm really not trying to be rude. I'm just frustrated, sorry.""

She chuckled. 

""It's not about that, not at this stage. I'm interested to know why you feel frustrated though. This is a long process, I told you that when we started."" 

Week five was O.K, though it left a lot to be desired. It's unnerving to have your actions questioned like that, especially after people thinking there's something wrong with you. It's not easy to come back from that, people always have the lingering doubt even if you're all in the clear. 

""Alright. Yeah, my week was alright. The homework part was weird, I feel like I've been doubting myself alot since what happened the other week. Like, people are being weird even though I've told them I'm fine.""

""People?"" She asked.

""Yeah, my Dad, he won't drop it. It's not like this is anything different? Like if this was out of the ordinary then yeah, sure, be worried. But it's normal for me, I do nice things, I do big things, but if they don't hurt anyone, obviously I would never do that, I just don't get the concern when I've been cleared?"" 

Week three, though eventful, was not the reason that they were assessed by the mental health team. After a twelve week waiting list, they were seen, assessed, and, well, if there are any changes, give your GP a call. Standard stuff.

""People are allowed to be worried about you. Why does that bother you?"" She asked, earnestly.

""Right, but why worry when nothing is wrong? That's not normal. Why is abnormal behaviour O.K if it's not me doing it? Like I do something a bit off, everyone looses it, but people worry about someone normal and that's fine because it's worry? Who's drawing that line?""

She paused. ""Your behaviour is concerning to people. That makes them worry. While it might not be mental illness, it's not quite what anyone would call normal. You know that. You wouldn't be here if you thought otherwise.""

Their Dad didn't approve; the headlines were the worst of it all, constant questions from colleagues, the whole situation had become more of an ordeal. One good deed is heroic, but making a habit of it? He insisted it looked bad. Made you seem like you had something to prove. 

""Can you say that?""

She frowned, ""sorry?""

""Can you tell me I'm not normal? Isn't that like, against the rules or something?""

She chuckled once more, ""I didn't say you weren't normal. I said your behaviour wasn't. Which it isn't. People wouldn't be so interested in you if it were. We're here to figure out why you feel the need to do these things.""

Before they could begin again, she interjected.

""We need to finish soon, by the way"", indicating at the wall clock. 

""Yeah."" 

""It will get easier,"" she insisted, ""but I need you to remember that you came here. I'm not forcing you. You are struggling with your actions. I know it's difficult to have them questioned, but your defensiveness is really hindering your progress right now.""

""Yeah."" 

""I won't give you any more to do this week. But I want you to be open to being more open. You aren't paying me to sit here in silence every week, I know you want to talk about things. So have a think, and come back to me, okay?""

""Yeah. Thank you. I'll see you next week"".

relationship_advice,ezx2m9o,t3_d2vlrm,1568230662.0,"Hey. Firstly, while cheating is obviously not a good thing to do, it doesn't automatically make you a bad person, and you should work on accepting this as an action that you've done, and learning from it. Don't let it chase you for the rest of your life. 

Secondly, just wondering the age gap? You said he was older and you feel inexperienced. Do you mind sharing your respective ages? 

If there is distance between you, it may be because of what happened, however I think communicating with him about this is the best way to go. If he forgives you, it should not be held over you, though a bit of distance while maybe he figures out his feelings about this is also natural."

relationship_advice,ezpwaec,t3_d1txwm,1568050032.0,"It sounds like, regardless of his sexuality, that this relationship isn't working for you. You are looking for intimacy and he doesn't seem to want to give it, for whatever reason. Though I understand looking for a reason for this, I don't think speculating about his sexuality is going to be very useful for you. I would have a conversation with him about where this conversation is going, and outline the things you aren't happy with in the relationship. Good luck X"
