BipolarReddit,ffetw4i,t3_et2lbh,1579865314.0,"I hear you as they can slip right in, under the radar, until it's casual.  Nothing tragic or emotional, just like I wonder what I'll do before I get the newspaper.

When people say suicide is selfish, they are talking from their own point of view.  You are taking yourself out of my life - I am losing you - I will be hurt.  While these are true, they are the selfish ones.  I had a friend I lost to suicide, and he was in so much pain all the time, I don't see it as selfish.  I'm not promoting suicide (fucking clearly), but unless you've been in that situation yourself, shut the fuck up.  

You need to have someone, or two, in your life who ""get it"" as in ""have it"" as in a disorder themselves.  No one without one will ever be able to understand what you're going through, no therapist or doctor included.  Best of luck as you naivgate.  Onward."

BipolarReddit,fd6oi74,t3_ek71pq,1578193809.0,"I can understand your anticipation for your new job and I wonder if this is amping up your anxiety.  6 hours is still plenty of sleep.  2-4 hours is highly concerning, and basically confirming an episode.   

That being said, take your situation seriously, and also soberly - you may just be worried, and that's okay.  Also, no job is worth putting your wellness in jeopardy. 

Drink water.  If there's anything that works for you to relax, try it.   Try to be easy with yourself, do something enjoyable.  You're starting a new job and that's a good thing.  As a current out of work BP1, I can say that where you are is a great place.   Proud of you - best of luck."
