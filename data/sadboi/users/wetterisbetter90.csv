I spent my 20's loving sex or at least I pretended to becauss that's what I was shown, I assumed that's what they all wanted. Since my divorce I've totally changed. I get extremely nervous when I'm around men. When I go on dates or know intimacy is coming I clam up and get terrified. I have had instances where I'd have flash back during sex. I also feel really gross after anything sexual. Just like I did when I was little. All the emotions of being scared, feeling gross, overwhelming sadness, etc hit me now.
