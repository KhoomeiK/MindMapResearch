StopSelfHarm,fq751pw,t3_gh2rgo,1589141886.0,"When we lack the coping skills to relieve our emotional pain we find not so healthy ways to do so. I started self harming at a really young age because I didnt know how to cope with my clinical depression. I can completely relate to everything you've said. I'm 29 now and at times I still want to resort to SH however I've come a long way in the last 20 years to learn healthy coping mechanisms. And the good news is there are things you can do to help yourself before things escalate - because it will continue to escalate. 

In the moment it can help to squeeze an ice cube tightly in your hand until it melts. I found this to be the best technique for me when I want to hit myself. You get the pain, sensations, and relief but it's not actually inflicting harm on your body. Counting backwards from 100 and taking deep breaths, focusing on inhaling and exhaling can be calming.

 I found some relief from writing both fictional stories and journaling. Sometimes putting words to your emotions can help. You mentioned scrapbooking so maybe this can be a way to express yourself. Make a list of activities that help relax you. Going for a walk, coloring, painting, scrapbooking, photography, anything you can think of that helps calm you. 

Get into therapy asap. A therapist will help you learn to cope with emotions and work through any traumas you have experienced. If you feel comfortable talking with your parents about SH and they will support you, do that. Some parents are understanding, some are not at all and you'll probably have an idea about how your parents will help you (or not). At the very least talk to them about getting a therapist. 

You're not alone! Many of us have trouble coping and have used SH to relieve our pain. Getting it under control now is important so it doesnt escalate. Hang in there."

 An example I did: I wanted to stand up straight, shoulders back and look up while I walked, not stare at the ground and avoid eye contact with others. This did wonders  for my self confidence.  So every single day I reminded myself to stand tall and look up every time I was on my feet. Eventually enough days went by that this became how I held myself and now it's just who I am.

I promise, the older you get the less it will bother you!!! Seriously. There are wayyy more things to stress about besides what other people think of you. I learned that a long while ago. My scars are part of who I am and I own them. Anyone else's opinion about me is not my business anyways.

 When I was 24 I started my current job working in a lumber mill. At least 3x a week for the first few months one of my coworkers would see the scars on my arms and ask me about them. It's really obvious that they are from SH but people would constantly bring them up when I'd interact with them and just ask what they were from. It didnt bother me. I'd say ""they're just scars from when I was younger"" and I'd leave it at that. They never pressed me about it more than that. I just think they were curious as to what I'd say.

Now, at 29 I'm a lot more open about my struggles with mental health and addiction so I'd probably be more open to questions from others.

Advice,fpufiuw,t3_gffwyx,1588911613.0,"Porn is acting!! Its not real. Its unfortunate many men think that porn is real sex. Porn is entertainment geared (most often) towards men and so many males learn their sex ed from porn and are sold this false narrative that that's what sex is supposed to be like. It sucks for us women but we have to communicate, show and help them understand what real, amazing sex is. Porn can be great as part of your sex life but it's not an instruction manual.

Your husband clearly needs to grow up and get over himself. Since divorce isnt something you are considering I'd recommend counseling as your best bet if you want to salvage your marriage. He needs to learn that relationships go both ways and you should want to please each other. He needs to communicate and tell you what pleases him, not force you to watch 2 people act out a scripted scene and then make you do the stuff you see that you quite clearly are uncomfortable with. Tell him to get over himself. Husbands should want to please their wives equally (potentially more even) than a wife pleases them.

Please go see a couples therapist or a sex therapist. Dont take his misogynistic crap and stand up for yourself. You guys can overcome this. It takes communication and understanding on both sides. I hope you work it out. Take care"

Handwashing is key and being mindful of the places your hands go. If you can be aware of that and avoid as much close contact with others as you can then you'll be ok. Just being hyper aware of your body will help a lot. 

You can take a lot of precautions while working if you decide to go back. Wear a good mask, wash your hands often and thoroughly, wear gloves, be sure you're staying away from people as much as possible, take off your clothes before you go in your house after work and immediately wash them and shower. These are just a few precautions you can take. I'm sure there are other ideas if you do a little research. I'd also take your temperature in the AM and PM. When at home you can stay away from your dad or have him wear a mask around you. 

If you want/need to go back just be aware of yourself. This virus isn't just going to go away it's going to be here forever so we just have to adapt as best as we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Take care"

Alcohol made me feel amazing (for a short amount of time) so I figured other substances would do the same. (And this line of thinking is how addiction really took ahold of me.)

I have no regrets from smoking. If anything I regret drinking (5+ years sober now). I've seen the positive impact that marijuana can have and how it can help people. The stigma around it is beginning to lift and people are able to use it as medicine. I grow now and if anything it's had a positive impact on my life.

- People constantly apologize for being emotional   even at times when their emotions are CLEARLY justified (ex. crying when you're talking about something difficult such as losing a loved one) It's ok to cry or let your emotions out. You're not weak and no one's judging you for it.

Mental illness

- Clinical depression, anxiety, and other disorders are shameful for those of us that have lived with them eventhough there's no reason for this shame to exist. More people would be willing to get help if there was less stigma around it."

Advice,fp8m908,t3_gc0nwv,1588396111.0,"Consequences. The brief satisfaction you'd get from ending this person's life isn't worth the consequences you'd face. Don't throw your life away over something that happened 30 years ago. Your dad wouldn't want that for you. Hand the information over to the police, hire a PI, write into some of the true crime shows out now that can help, anything that isn't stooping down to that level."
Advice,fp7rdhh,t3_gbsga4,1588376214.0,"I'm so sorry you're going through this. You don't deserve any of the shit you mentioned. Your dad is an asshole and you deserve SO MUCH BETTER!!! I want you to know that you're not alone. A lot of us have absent fathers and it's so fucked. I personally don't have a great relationship with my father and I spent 26 years of my life trying to get my dad to give a shit about me. My mom abandoned me at 2 yrs old and my dad was the only person that was consistent in my life. The crazy thing is that while physically he was there, emotionally he wasnt. I feel like this is similar to what you're experiencing. We long and yearn for their love and attention but they're emotionally unavailable. 

One thing I know for sure tho is that my dad loves me. Your dad loves you as well. No matter what he does (or doesnt do) he will always love you and that's a fact. I think they are self absorbed and don't understand how their daughters truly need their guidance in life. 

Unfortunately you can't force your dad to step up to the plate. Things you can do:

- Go to therapy. Talking my daddy issues through with a therapist did wonders for me. It was a real game changer for me to hear someone else tell me that I wasnt the problem. There are online therapy programs or in person, just look it up.

- Get him to go to family therapy with you. He sounds hella stubborn, but if you can convince him to do this (stress how important this is for you) even just once it will help. 

- Talk to him at a neutral time and calmly express that you need him in your life. Be specific, tell him actual actions he can take to help you.  Speak from the heart and tell him how hes hurt you and step by step things that he can do for you.

- If there are activities he enjoys that you could do with him (fishing, etc.) ask to tag along or have him teach you something he enjoys.

Hang in here sweetheart. I hope things get better for you."
Advice,fp7lw8j,t3_gbqx31,1588373105.0,"Borderline personality disorder is manageable but it takes a lot of effort on your part. I know it can be really challenging but you're not alone in this. 

You need to get in to talk to a therapist regularly and be open minded and willing to put in the work to heal. Look into dialectical behavioral therapy. If you can, find a therapist that specializes in dbt. This can do wonders to help reprogram your brain and improve your life day to day.

You really can learn to manage these mood swings and lift your mood. Journaling can help some. Try focusing on the positives like listing what you're grateful for. Try to get on a routine schedule with self care. Be sure you're getting adequate sleep every night. Make a list of things that you find comforting (a hot bath, a walk outdoors, music, drawing, deep breathing, counting backwards from 100, etc.) and when you begin noticing yourself getting irritable, try to refocus yourself to something from your list. Over time you won't have to try quite so hard to redirect yourself. 

You don't deserve to suffer and you don't have to. You're strong and you can overcome this. Things will get better. Hope this helps."
