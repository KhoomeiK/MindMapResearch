The lies, embarrassments and the financial, physical and mental pain she caused would have been all avoided, I would have never had to deal with cancer, being homeless for awhile, and the I do not care family members. 

To think I stayed here because I did not want to hurt those very same people who could care less and have caused me the most pain. At this point the more and more I give thought to what I could have missed. The more i am mad at myself for not doing it a year ago. I understand now that i was too concerned about their pain rather than mine. No one has call me to see who I am doing nor has anyone given a fuck about what I am going through with the cancer. 

A year ago I was in a great relationship with a woman I felt I would always have in my life. A year ago I had a great career with potential to move up. I had a home, a social life, and a purpose in life. Now all of that is gone."

The other one that some my call "" camping"" is holding an lane of approach ( fire sector) to denied access and movement if the OpFor. To me they are two different types of game play. However, if your style is more of the run and gun that employes constant movement then it might be one in the same.

When I use run a clan way back in the days with former military guys. We would be called camper by the run and gun types of player. However, setting fire sectors that support each other and controlling the battlefield and spawns point made total sense to us. 

We would still move if someone went down to cover that area but once that players was back in the fight we would return back to our assigned sector. That would often result in us winning more games than we lost. 

Two of my favorite tactic to use against run and gunners would be to kill them and allow the kill cam to show me remaining in the same location only to move to another loction that over look that one and kill them again when they came back for that all to important revenge kill. I would also bait a players to come after me only to have a another teammate of mine take him out. If I knew the player was behind me I would cut across a corner that I knew my teammates had covered and let them know I had a meal for them on the way...lol!"

You might want to consider the following: What if you had no limitations of time? Meaning you did not have to worry about your mortality. Additionally, what if you had the ability to fix, correct, and make anything you want? What if death to you was not something that held power over you and that at anytime you could do away with it? 

Something to think about?"
SuicideBereavement,fmmgtk2,t3_fvfx4x,1586205006.0,"I will tell you my experience with suicide in hopes you maybe able to understand where I am coming from. From someone that has experienced the lost of a few people to suicide and from the perspective of somone that is fighting to hold to life myself. 

In May I Iost a fellow soldier ( 3rd one so far) to suicide while on the phone with him. There was me and another guy from our  regiment all of which deployed together servel times. We tried to get him to underatand he was not alone in his fight. Ultimately, he was unwilling to listen and shot himself while we were on the phone with him.  

This one hurt because he was the reason I am here to this day. It was him that pulled me out of a burning Humvee along with two other soldiers. He went against SOP during an ambush and stayed in the killzone ( on the X) to pull us out. 

My aunt took her life in July and I was very shocking to me but to all that knew her. She was there for most of my childhood as her and her husband stayed with us for 6 yrs. I was the ring boy in her marriage and she was married in our house. Her and my mother were very, very close more so than other aunts and uncles in our family. She was quick to tell you about yourself if you were not doing your best. She had that Alpha type personality to put it in plan English. 

As for myself and what I battle each and everyday consider this. Before I say anything just know when I tell you my story, it is not to diminish or take away with what you are feeling right now. Nor is it a competition on who has it worst. Rather, just trying to draw a  parallel line between you and me. 

After going through May and July of last year and the lost. I now had to deal with the lost of someone I truly loved and cared about for almost 5 years. She decided in August to end our relationship and this was a shock to me. Just a few days prior we were talking about wedding rings. What hurts the most is how she was able to walk right into another commited relationship with 2 weeks of our break up. This told me that she had been seeing this guy way before we broke up. Once I saw her text messages ( we stayed together) it was no doubt left. 

The break up came in August and in September I was diagnosed with testicular cancer stage 3C metastasize. When I told her about my diagnosis he simply said "" so when are you going to move out? At that point I lost all desire to continue in this world. This also severely damaged our relationship. We fought as to who was going to stay and who was going to leave. When I told her I would take over the lease she said ok at first but end up using the Courts to and file for a civil protection order and in that order it had a termcalled ex parte. This caused for the immediate removal from the home even when there is no domestic violence of any kind and never was there. The bar of proof is so low in cases like this that it makes it easy and cheaper than getting an eviction. 

 I was homeless without anywhere to go for a few months. I am left to deal with my MDD, PTSD, and Cancer all alone by myself. I even lost  on a great job opportunity due to the CPO. The job would have taken care of my housing as I would have been working overseas where my room and board was paid for by the company. Additionally, this would have been a six figure job and much better than the one I have now. 

So believe me I sometimes feel like I am on trial by GOD without any reason. Every day I look for a reason to stay alive and continue to move forward. It is not easy but I am doing the best that I can. That is all anyone can ask of somone. You have to dig down in your soul to find the strength as depression can burrow you so deep you will not be able to see the sky. 

I have had someone people step up and offer help. My current job helped with my legal fee as well as offer me some additional financial help. So people do care while others do not. You have to find those that do and help them help you."

I know how it feels to have someone you love become lost to you. It is one of the most difficult situations for humans to cope with. We are designed to want to be together and have a sense of community. This could be the reason you found your way here now. 

Keep going to your appointment with your therapist and use that time to not only deal with your ex death but to work on things that you need to do for yourself. The medication is only the first step to give you the opportunity to work on the neccessary skills set to cope with life. For most they are not the beginning and end of their treatment. 

In time I hope you will grow and become a better person not only for yourself but to everyone you come in contact with. My ex did what you did to a point and I walked the path your ex did for awhile. In my heart it hurt and I was more focus on ending my pain than causing her pain. I cannot say for sure your ex felt this way but there is a good chance he did. 

Sucide is not a punishment for the living but rather a release for the dead. So stop beating yourself on this and become the person your ex wanted you to be and make a life for yourself he would be pround of. Take the time to learn those coping mechanisms so that you will not be tempted to seek those in others but rather possess them within you. 

Take care of yourself and give it time. I wish you the best."

My aunt lived with us throughout my ealier childhood and I also went to stay with her when my mother and I were not seeing eye to eye after my father past away.The soldier is the reason why I am here today. Had it not been for his actions I would have burned up in a Humvee along with two others. It was his action and breaking with protocol that saved my life. 

He took his life while on a call with a few of us. I feel his lost each and everyday. I wish I could have said the right words. Some ancient magical chant that would have cured the truth. Yet, I stood there tumbling through thoughts and word like a drunkard fumbling through his keys trying to find the one that fits the lock. The lock would opened the door of keepong him here for his wife, kids, and selfishly myself. After the sound report of the round. We all were in disbelief and silence fondle me like an estranged lover. 

I say all this because I understand ( in my mind) how helpless one can feel after being exposed to an event like this. I tell you this much in that I have seen of the most strongest people I knew fall weak at the knees from the lost of someone to suicide. Guys that are the personification  of barrel-chested Alpha Male personalities shed enough tears to saturate a sun scorch garden.

As someone that has attempted and survived I can tell you only what my mind was focus during those attempts. I cannot say with a 100% surety that your brother was feeling the same however, there should be some commonality. 

When you are in that dark place there are things that will lose their meaning. What one may feel is a sense of disconnection from people and things they once loved and most likely still do. Once you reach that point ( at least for me it was) how others will feel because of your death does not enter ones mind. What your real and current focus is getting rid of your own pain not that of others. I guess this is how someone people seem to see that sucide is a selfish act. I do not see it that way and if people actually understood how hard it is to take ones on lives I believe they might change their view. 

Your brother was in a lot of pain and sometimes when people ask why they did not reach out. Often times it is because the person feels that the pain they are feeling cannot be take away by anyone else but them. So why bother talking about it to some if it (the pain) will still be there after the conversation. 

I am sure  your brother did not want to hurt you on anyone for that matter. It just wanted to end his pain. You will feel mad, sad, perplexed,  many other emotions but that is fine. It has taken me years to come to terms of losing a friend. My aunt died in July of 2019 and I have yet be able to fully process that.

SuicideBereavement,fk9ul8y,t3_fgjyt7,1583983963.0,"I will tell you a story that very few know me actually know about. I was 16 years old and we had a gun in the house as someone had broken in while myom was by herself. One night I was bored and decided that I would take the gun into the wood dien the street and let off a few rounds. 

At that time my understand of guns is now where near what I know now after being in the military for ten years.

So there I went and after shooting 4-5 rounds i decided i had enough fun for the night. My understand at the time was that if the magazine was no longer in the mag well and I did not pull the slide back prior to pulling out the magazine that the gun would be safe. 

I can recall saying to myself I wonder what the sound of a gun would be if I put it to the temple and pull it. Would I hear the click of an unload gun? 

I thought about it fir a few seconds and decided to not try it even though I felt the gun was save. I placed it into my pocket and started to walk back home. When I tried to pull it out it pull the trigger and the gun went off with a loud bang. I felt around my body without looking down as I had hear it will not hurt if you are shot at first until you actually see the wound. 

I checked and I was ok but my pocket to my coat and the front of the coat was ruin. I am not say that you son did or did not do this on purpose only how I almost killed myself."

Maybe it is that we have different views on the subject matter however, that should not a prerequisite or not understanding what I wrote. 

""Are you another anti-theist, or are you trying to promote a theological position of some sort? ""

Answer: no and nor should my statement be seen as such. I believe what you are trying to imply is that because I do not employ fear as a machination to prevent somone from thinking about or taking their life. 

This to me using fear is not actually fixing the problem and also shows a lack of understanding and transparency. Which as I said before will only make that person resentful and untrusting. How long do you think in this day and age you can make claims before that info is made available to the person you might have been trying to help? What do you think will happen to your relationship when the info does not support your understanding or system of beliefs? What becomes your validity?

Death is the wage that sin pays as such there is no greater punishment period! There should be no misunderstanding as the meaning behind that scripture. 

To use fear is to forsake what being a Christian is all about. I would say that if you really want to help someone that may be thinking about attempting suicide. Start with understand the condition of mental illness that is were you will gain the most support.

I do not want to lose anyone to sucide either however, I believe being honest and understanding is the best option. I can not speak for God nor can I think like him. What I can say is that it is my belief that the way man looks at death and how God looks at it are very different. As there is nothing we do that he cannot undue. I lost quite a few people to sucide as recently I took months ago. She went to church and even had her pastor speak at the funeral. She fought it for many years however, there does come a time when even the strongest soldier has to put their weapons of war down. I miss her everyday and I know many in my family feel the same way. 

I know in my heart of heart we will meet again and the same goes for the others I lost be it sucide or any other way of death. I know that she is not feeling pain and is conscious of nothing. My hope that through God's undeserved kindness we all will see each other again and there will be no death or sin. 

I hope you really take stock in what I am trying to explain to you and use that to better equip yourself should you ever have the need to help somone that is suffering from a mental illness. Treat the condition rather than the symptoms. Fear should never be used by any Christian as it shows a lack of faith and a deficiency in scriptural knowledge."
AskAChristian,fjlr1u5,t1_fanun8n,1583452492.0,"What are you attempting to do or make reference to is 'fear"" as a deterrent which is not something I believe is the route one should go as if usually builds resentment from the recipient as it can be seen as manipulation. 

We have to look at the actual definition of the word sin and not interpretation. I am poet and often use words that have a duality to them, almost like a simile. Therefore, when someone reads a poem of mine they can interpreted in different ways than I actually intended it to be. It is only when and if you have access to the original Arthor can you be sure of the meaning. 

However, the word sin means simply "" to miss the mark"" what people chose to interpret that meaning is really up to them. For me i take it as the meaning not the interpretation.

We are not God and as such cannot reason on his level. What we can do is understands that he know out heart and also knows what we can and cannot take. It is his choice what he does or not do to those that take their lives. 

As tragic is something like suicide is we should not use fear or manipulation stop it. This shows a lack of scriptural knowledge not by not the person that takes their life but the one who is passing judgment."
AskAChristian,fjlpwst,t3_ea3a4i,1583451765.0,"I might ne late to this post however, I did want to actually say it as someone that has experienced the lost of a love ones and at times suffer from the thoughts of suicide myself. 

Scripturally, there is very little or no direct talk about the out of those who have taken their own lives. What we do know and it based in scripture is that "" death is the wage that sin pays"". So if sucide is a sin then the cost of that sin is death. It is very simple to understand. 

We cannot speak or reason as God but what we can do is understand what sin is and how God knows our hearts. He also by his word loves us all and knows what we face. Metal illnesses is no different than a medical issue and as result of the sin we inherited from Adam and Eve."

I would agree with the idea that you should feel some type of guilt about the death as without the divorce this may have not happened. I will say that while you did not actually make your husband take his life you have to take responsibility for creating an environment for this to be a possible outcome. You being with him for over 19 years gave you a better understanding than most have on here or in your life. 

Everyone does gave the right to be happy and I am not saying you did not. However, you do have the responsibility to make sure that your path of happiness does not create a situation like what you now have. What I mean by this is the moment to another relationship before your marriage had actually ended for both of you. 

This is where I see your guilt is justified as you made a choice to not be up front with him and all things. At least to me it seems you were not really committed to the counseling or making the marriage work as you already checked out 9 years ago by your own words.

Here is a lesson about men : failure is a major thing with a lot of men. We are taught to masters of our fate. Rather this be career, romantic, or physical. If anyone of those things were at risk with your manager then statistically sucide is a common result.

So your brother's decision while very disappointing and has caused so much pain it is something a lot of people go through than we may want to admit. 

We would like to think that loving someone and the lost of thqt love is common enough to be a stage in life. Almost a rite of passage to some extent. All to often we forget how impactful our actions can affect others. As long as it does not break any laws or social norms most behavior are not looked at as wrong. Scientifically speaking losing a lover in a failed relationship effects the brain in the same way you are being effected now. In that it caused the same pain as losing someone to death. 

Without knowing your brother or his ex and their relationship there is a lot I cannot say with a 100% certainty. I know what my ex put and still is putting me the through.

To add insult to injury I suffer from PTSD due to my 10 yrs in the Army, lost a fellow soldier to sucide in May, lost the only aunt who I  was really close with in July, found out that my ex cheated on me in August and to top everything I was diagnosed with cancer in September...at lot to take in such a short period of time. 

Her statement to me was I was not happy. While I agree everyone should have a right to happens however, we also have a moral obligation not to pursue it in a way that does not bring so much pain and destruction. 

I am not trying to judge your brother's ex however, there are a few things you said that make me believe she help create an environment where suicide was an option for your brother. One being having sex with his bestfriend. Where I come from that is something off limits no matter when the relationship ened. That and sleeping with a brother or sister of a friend. 

I feel bad that your brother had to go through all this alone. However, I can understand why he remained quite to his family as I have done the same. I still fight everyday the feelings of ending my life. Each day I try to find a reason to continue on. Some day are easier than others. Having to get through what would have been our 5th yrs anniversary, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and the New Years, while sleeping in my car was hard very hard. 

You will get through this and hopefully the day will come when you will see your brother again. May God keep you and your family in his hands. I wish you and your family the best."

He suffered from PTSD, TBI, and he had a stroke as well. He would call during the day while I was at work when he knew I could not talk for to long. This became a problem as it was happening to often. 

Well, I blocked his number after asking him to call me when I was off work. He did not respect that so I had to. However, I think about when he went against military  protocol and came back from me when he should have done something different. He was there for me when he should not have. When he needed me most i was not there and he is gone now as he took his life 

I lost my Aunt in July to the same and my mother is still not doing well. My mother was in a bad place one before and had thought about suicide and my Aunt talked her out of it. I to suffer my MDD and PSTD as well due to the my tours. The unit I was in during my tours is not one you wnat to seem weak as the old saying was you volunteer three times to be here. As such we were told to suck it up and keep moving I even recall saying the same thing to my soldiers myself so how could I not due the same?

I take have no trust in the mental healthcare community especially in the VA. The no person that I thought was there for me walked out when I needed her the most so I have to carry on. 

Your friend can be in a dark place but you having been there should be able to share some light. Maybe not all but just a little can help. It is your choice as to what you feel is right. I am not a mental health professional so I cannot tell you what to do. What I can say is if another one of my soldiers every goes through this and I know about it I will not do what I did before and listen to people that know neither him, me, or the situation. So that take what you want from my story what you want. I wish you the best."

 We all have the right to be with who we chose. However, we do have a moral obligation to do it in a way that cause no harm. You no longer wanting to be with her and looked elsewhere for your happiness. The way you went about is why you feel the way you do. 

I am not a psychologist or psychiatrist so I will not trying and diagnose your ex-girlfriends mental behavior. What I will say is that sucide can be a event or a symptom of an underlying mental health condition.

We do not know nor do you. As such I cannot say if it would have happened no matter what your relationship with her was. I also cannot say if the event of your break -up acted as a catalyst.

The best and only thing you can do now is to move forward, grow, and come to the understanding that your actions do have real consequences. Cheating is a betrayal and I believe you understand that now. Learn from this and become a better person, boyfriend, and husband."

I also ended a 5 yrs relationship in August and was diagnosed with testicular cancer in late September early October. I my only hope is that time goes by things will have less if a sting to them. 

My heart goes out to you Sir it really does. I have only one outlet and that would be my ability to write poetry fairly well. I use that when I can to help me when things hit me hard some days. Maybe finding a way to express yourself may help."
SuicideBereavement,f7hi0hr,t1_f7h8lpe,1573741060.0,"I am experienced lost not so much with a wife or lover beside a painful break up. However, I have lost family and friends to suicide and you are right in regards to people being on guard about speaking the name of the deceased. 

I lost a fellow soldier in my and an aunt in July. In the Army we speak the name all the time and will for awhile when members of my unit are together will buy the lost soldier and friend a drink everytime we buy one. I will say it does at times perplexed the heck out of the bartender at times having beer just sitting there sometimes 4-5 glasses. We just tell them our friend is running late. 

The point I am trying to make is to speak the name of the our lost brother is how we keep his memory alive. To recall our time with him is how we make sure that we keep him with us. 

A lot of people think to ignore is a way to move forward or show compassionate by being up someone who have left this world however, I, as do not feel the same."
SuicideBereavement,f7hbel9,t1_f7gp2gb,1573737053.0,"Thank you very much for your kind words. I will say that I have my good days and bad days and while the help had been offered and is much appreciated. I still have long way to go to getting back to myself of 5 mos ago. 

Physical pain is still there from my illness but I am doing what needs to be done. Emotionally, which to me is harder to deal with at times than the physical pain will take time.

My journey as only at the first stage but I will try to keep my head in the fight to get better."
SuicideBereavement,f7g8d6n,t3_dvp613,1573697170.0,"The term "" move on"" has to be one of the most insensitive unsolicited recommendations. At who's pace shall you move on and to what destination shall your movement lead you to? 

You move to a place mentally where you will find the comfort you need. Love is not a noun but rather a verb as such your emotions are representative of that love. 

I wish i could tell you that everything will be just fine however, it is not for me to make that call. When you are ready you will know. Until then you have take care of yourself as that is what your mate would have wanted for you. 

I have been on both sides of of this issue. I lost a fellow soldier ( who actually saved my life and 2 others soldiers when our vehicle was hit by IED He was awarded a bronze star for that ) in May and aunt in July both to suicide. 

In August I was told by the love of my life for  5 yrs our relationship was over, and that she was cheating on me for a whole year  

September I was told I have testicular cancer stage 3 that has metastasized to my lungs. When I told my ex of the diagnosis her response was; So, when are you moving out""

 Speaking about moving out in Oct I was forced out of my home by some trumped-up domestic violence claim ( the case was thrown out but the damage was done)that my ex used to get a ex parte or quick removable. Of which made me homeless since Oct 17th. 

Now the good news: I beat the DV case as the statement on the court ruling said No merit to domestic violence. She is now having to pay my attorney fees as well as for items she took out of the house that were not hers. 

I left my wallet and bank and credit card in the home when I was asked to leave. So I had no money. I called my best friend and ask could he loan me 20.00 for gas. We used an app called Cash app and instead of the 20.00 dollars I asked for I recieved 220.00. 

My Job stepped in and offered to pay my attorney fees for the civil case I filed for abuse- of- process. 

My bestfriend mom offerd to have me stay in a property that she owns and only ask that I pay the utilities.

My job award me a  very sizable grant that I do not have to pay back or tax on. 

A client of mine who lives in Mexico has offerd to pay my air fare for my trip there for 2 weeks and will cover all my expenses while there. 

The owner of the little corner store a few feet from the home I was forced out of. Has offered to cover anything he sell at his store. 
When the bank put a hold on check that I needed the funds to be able to travel back and forth to work. He offer to give me money until the check cleared. 

My therapist at the VA actually visited me on her own time ( for 3 hours) to have coffee and talk with me. She did not get compensated for the time she spent with me. 

I know this all sound too good to be true and I'm still coming to terms with all the out pouring of help. I never had to asked as help was all given. Which was a surprise to me as my own family did not even offer help and when asked they all declined.

My point is there are good people out there and are just waiting to help. Do not be too proud to ask as you never know what they might do."
SuicideBereavement,f75rtj6,t3_dtwwa6,1573418436.0,"Coming from someone that has been on both ends of the Spectrum but was able to survived my on attemp ( gun jamed) and the lost of a lover. I can tell you a few things from my perspective.

1) There was nothing you could have done in reason. We are dealing with humans here and as such we can hide and manipulate situations to get a desired outcome. When I attempted my sucide it was something I kept close to me chest. This was for fear that I would be persuaded to alter my. Or taken somewhere I did not want to go like a psych ward. Sometimes going to a psych ward for some it can exacerbate the condition and make it worse. 

2) Depending on the person and their situation the reason a too numerous to try and point to one specific events as to why someone went through with their plan. 

Side note: Me personally is was a series of events that pushed me to that point of no return. I lose a fellow soldier in May, my aunt in July both to suicide, I lost the woman thought I would have fir a life time. However, 4.5 years she ended it. It even more to learn that she was cheating on me for almost one year, being diagnosed with testicular cancer and to hear my now then ex after learning of my diagnosis and prognosis simply responded with : so when are you moving out?"" That last statement  seem to perplex  most anyone I talk to even my own doctors. Anyway, I became homeless living in my car when ex decide to kick me out of our home. 

So I has a lot going on and I am still recovering from the  destruction of 2019. What I can tell you is that it is a pain that ones try's to kill not themself. It is almost like you know for sure that if you take your life it is a sure thing there will be no more pain. 

3) You have to come to terms that it was not your fault as to why. It is most likely a result of a mental illness that caused this type of action. I know for my self it was PTSD ( survivor's remorse)  and MDD that caused me to break down. Being in a relationship with someone you love can help with a chemical imbalance at times as there is a reward system in the brain. However, it should not been seen as a long term treatment strategy. 

4) Take care of yourself and it should not matter as much how they died but rather how they lived and what they left behind. To be remembered is to be immortal and without time. 

I had to learn all this many times over not only for the ones lost be for myself as well. When from 10 yrs ago committed suicide it took a long time to recover but it will come. Will the senses of lost be gone completely? NO but it will be more manageable over time."

A man must be buried.
It is not unusual that the old bury the young though it is an abomination.
It is not strange that the unwise and the ungentle carry the banner of humaneness though it is a castration of the spirit.
It no longer shatters the intellect that those who make war call themselves diplomats.
We are no longer surprised that the unfaithful pray loudest every Sunday in church and sometimes in rooms facing east though it is a sin and a shame.
So how do we judge a man.
Most of us love from our need to love not because we find someone deserving.
Most of us forgive because we have trespassed not because we are magnanimous.
Most of us comfort because we need comforting, our ancient rituals demand that we give what we hope to receive.
And how do we judge a man.
We learn to greet when meeting, to cry when parting and to soften our words at times of stress.
The women gather with cloth and ointment, their busy hands bowing to laws that decree willows shall stand swaying but unbroken against even the determined wind of death.
We judge a man by his dreams, not alone his deeds.
We judge a man by his intent, not alone his shortcomings.
We judge a man because it is not unusual to know him through those who love him.

SuicideBereavement,f5dy06b,t3_dlczcu,1572161506.0,"While I do not agree with some of the comments I regards to : ""It is not our purpose in life to save anyone"" as that seem like a self-absorbed person. What I will say is that mental illness is a real and very hard thing to deal with as your mind really never shuts off even when you are sleep.

I  dealt with depression PTSD for many years. I have also lost friends and family members to suicide. I wish I could tell you that things will go back t ok normal however, I have little desire to lie to you. What I will tell you is you have to create a new normal for yourself. 

It is never to understand when someone takes their own life. Our Society is built upon the preservation of life and thei appreciation. With that being said it is more always possible to developed and retain coping skills that are necessary when dealing with depression. It will take time for you find your new normal and began to feel whole again.

We never really know how long some will be in our lives however, the time that they were is a gift. Take that gift as you would any other gift from someone you love and put it to use. 

Death is a final destination for all of us and some will choose to move that date ahead of their chosen time. Understand that upon death the dead are not hurting any more as they cannot hear, see, or feel anything. What does continue to live on or the memories that she shared with that person. That is something death cannot take from you. 

There is a saying about death: Willow so stand swayed but unbroken even against the most determined wind of death. As time goes by you will be began to learn that our life as nor not our and ae have no claim to it whatsoever ever. We can not ass one single minute are expected time of departure."
