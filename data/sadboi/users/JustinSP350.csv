tinnitus,fmkgjs9,t1_fmkg4fo,1586154209.0,"gaming helps a lot, but I still hear the ringing through my headset, I have a really hard time concentrating these days tho so I dont read as much anymore sadly, maybe in the future when I can concentrate better I will start reading more. I donâ€™t have a lot of friends and they donâ€™t really understand me. I am 18 almost 19 btw. The most troubling thing is my tinnitus is because of a waterpark accident, where I did not even want to go to, also the person who is responsible got away so I couldnâ€™t even hold them responsible. I know Iâ€™m just venting but I just still really have not accepted it and I get really angry and sad about it sometimes just thinking how 1 decision devastated my life. But thanks for the advice, I needed someone to talk to because I feel like I canâ€™t really talk about it with people around me.

edit: also sleeping issues got me fucked up its already morning here and havenâ€™t slept a second the ringing and stress gives me very bad headaches."

I know suicide is not the answer but I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore I feel like I am out of options. And it is not of my current situation its just because of the isolation that I am alone with my thoughts en tinnitus and it scares me alot."
