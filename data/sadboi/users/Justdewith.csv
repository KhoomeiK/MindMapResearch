They never helped me come on time for things and blamed me for being lazy ( I was deeply depressed) . If they don't want to do things I'll be there and do some but defenetly not all. Just be there for them. Mine where so busy with my siblings that I got left out. My only option was to not be seen and not worry them. I won't have more than 2 kids cuz there will never be room for more without taking attention from the others.  Never go between the sibling if they want to spend time together. Give realistic baundries. Like, if you need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. That's OK. I can't count how many nights I have had to sleep with a full and painful bladder. Or woken up with one. If there are sweets its for everyone and not for specific family members. Like my list will probably never end cuz...

sweden,foky8tm,t3_g7qup7,1587851230.0,"Indeed, the media from America has absolutely changed a lot of things. 

We have slang specifically for when we mix English and Swedish. Swenglish. Cuz it is super common that you put English words in Swedish sentences. 

A lot of American slang is also used in everyday use. 

It is not weird at all since all I can remember from early 2000 is American shows and movies on Tv. Then there was the internet when youtube got more popular so we go even more material from the USA. Most games were in American English. If you wanted to know something you googled it in English. 

So I think the biggest influence is the language in itself. 

I also think that we compare our politics a lot to the US. almost obsessively. I think we talk more about American politics than Swedish and honestly, that is kinda sad. We Probably do it cuz we have a ""similar culture"" but also disagree with a lot of things. 

It changed a bit in our curriculum (I don't remember when) but before we could only be graded in British English but that got changed when American English was used more often by the students. In our school, we had to pick what dialect we wanted to learn since it also changes affects word spelling.

Another thing that has changed is the way we see Halloween. In early 2000 it was barely a thing. and now we celebrate both Alelgona and Halloween. 

There are a few things that stay Swedish tho. Like our holidays, work ethics, some foods like Kalles caviar, adding more cultures to our own like the thieves we are. 

And that was my list. I hope I came with some new insights for you.

And he is a walking red flag honestly. I didnt report him becouse I'm friends with his son. He is one of my best friends and I dont want to lose him.

Well, are you still seeing him in your day to day life? If you do thats a big problem. But if not then you really shouldnt answer him. You should know that you dont need to worry about his anxiety. you dont need to reply to him and I do understand if you worry, but you are not together anymore. You dont have to forgive him either. It sounds like a true dick move but you need to think about taking care of yourself. and that means not letting him take space in your mind. 

Do you want to speak up about it? I recomend that you should. 

Just dont do it on social media first. If your parents are suportive than talk to them. but the best help is to talk to a therapist or help organisation near you that is specialized in that field. They could potentaly help if he does acouse you for asaulting him. And if this does go to court. then both of you will have to present proof for being asoulted and that is really hard since this is mostly a word against word situation.   

If you do go to court and he is found guilty then its entiraly his problem from then on. and you can trash talk him on social media all you want. #metoo :3"
