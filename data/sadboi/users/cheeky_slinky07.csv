Nurse,fmzw7ks,t3_fyfyia,1586530792.0,"Same with me. I work in SNF. No admissions, all that’s left are custodial patients who are mostly stable. I feel guilty for being “glorified” as heroes. Also, today at work the admins are holding a “superhero day” for the staff. Sure, free food. But i feel guilty because as a nurse who is stuck there, I want to help."

AskReddit,feljg73,t1_fel2pd6,1579223637.0,It just taught me to not to get super duper attached to patients. Countertransference is real. I lost a dear friend where I never said a formal in person goodbye to. But I’m better now so thank you!
AskReddit,feind80,t1_fehwmrq,1579142576.0,"Summertime Sadness! 
I had a patient before who I became close to. Like really really attached that she told me I was the only one she trusted in the facility. Met all her family and introduced me to them as her favorite.  Anyhow, I advanced in my career and left that facility and went on a short vacay. When I came back I heard she died in the hospital... she was expecting to go home then and I promised that I’ll visit her when I come back. I never got to see her again. Then a week after learning that she passed away, I dreamt of her and told how much fun I had while on vacation... as my “visit” was about to end, she asked me if I could play my fave song which is Summertime Sadness and we listened to it together on my phone in the dream... woke up crying after that. Still love that song until now but it does remind me of that patient now."

Nurse,f7dow5r,t1_f7dnxbr,1573623726.0,I did the same route!!! Live in SD and took classes in San Bernardino just to get the license. It is hard to find schools now that offer the deficiency classes because of the super long waitlist. 😅
Nurse,f7dougd,t3_dvlhvc,1573623676.0,"It can be a strategy to save money and avoid student loans BUT, you have to make sure that the program or school is accredited by the BON. I had one classmate who made sure she got all concurrent theory and clinicals for the whole of nursing school that’s why she was able to get her RN license a year from graduating in the Philippines. That said classmate too is born and raised here in the US. 

I’d say stay here in the US to do nursing school because you’d be really guaranteed that you’ll be able to get your RN much much easier than what I experienced."

It is like beside nursing but then you’d be at the employ of the travel nurse agency and not the hospital I think. No benefits like 401k, sick pay, vacation pay for the friend though. The one advantage she has is that she can finish her contract for one hospital and jump to another hospital in a span of 3-6 months. Free time is indeed free time for her."

I also tried CeraVe but it gives me this white cast that is super super obvious because I’m brown skinned. It was the perfect match for me before.

AskReddit,etedwsh,t3_cb3ieh,1562729883.0,"Work in a LTC with 94 beds, I’m a new RN. First ever RN job too. Job title is RN supervisor. LTC is divided into two stations with 70 patients on one station and 24 on the other. I float for both stations but I always, always dread to be on the 70 patient side because you are the “charge” nurse and that even if you have your LVN as your floor nurse they come to you to help them as they are “too busy” with passing meds. 

The BS is that, you have to please everybody, do all things on time therefore having less overtime (I do at least 30 mins overtime on that 70 patient side), micromanage everything your staff does. 

Nope. No patience for that every single day. I’d burnout quickly. 

P.S. I love being a nurse but I have to think of myself and my mental health first.  🤗"

I haven’t tried taking notes yet. I will start that. 😊 
We have a 9-hour time difference and so super used to constant messaging. It is possible that we can start holding back some irrelevant things that doesn’t matter in the long run. We also try to schedule some time for us to really talk but it is not that often possible because of my work and his current life situation."
