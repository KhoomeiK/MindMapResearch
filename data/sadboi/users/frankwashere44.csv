Since the smart phone, females have taken over the internet, which was previously a male domain. Dating and fucking has basically been globalised. Guys aren’t competing with the men in their schools and workplaces anymore, they’re also competing with every guy within 100 miles, even if it’s only in theory much of the time.

Meanwhile women are hyper sexualised, posting ass in sink selfies on IG, soft core porn has been normalised, but at the same time women online are pickier than ever about the men they want to interact with. Partly understandable, they don’t want to be besieged by dick pics and horny guys, and they have so much choice. 

Plus, casual sex and “FWB” and “poly” has all been normalised. More sexual freedom you’d think would mean more sex for men. But it doesn’t, it means more sex for better looking men and less sex for the rest. More inequality, more resentment.

This is how it is. What women need from men is protection, labour and resources. These are all mandated by the state in myriad ways. What men need from women are sex and reproduction. One is forbidden to even purchase and the other is given complete control to women. And you wonder why men are becoming displeased with this arrangement.

This is just one small example of how sexual dynamics influence the entirety of life. How can you have never experienced how men behave around attractive women? 

Simple question: does an attractive man have it better than an unattractive man? The answer is the same for women vs men, as a whole.

It isn’t just casual sex. The idea that causal sex is disassociated with dating, relationships, fucking and everything else is absurd. It’s all the same thing. Having the sexual power makes everything easier. Women can get all of the above much easier than men. 

And it’s become much more so over the last 10 years. Since the iPhone. Since women now live in their phones. Which has globalised dating and exacerbated women’s disinterest in average and ugly men. And sexlessness for 20 something males has increased hugely.

What do political murders have to do with his capability as a leader? They illustrate my point if anything. Also, the US President commits political murders every day. Obama drone bombed thousands.

Life expectancy in Russia has increased hugely under Putin. Under Yeltsin (who the US supported and elected) it was much lower, there was mass poverty, etc. Putin has grown the middle class and improved the economy and people’s’ lives by pretty much every metric.

Eh? It’s much easier to influence democracies than dictatorships. The point is that external aggression creates and justifies internal repression. This is something that western countries are oblivious to, largely, because they’re safe and are either the dominant world power or under the umbrella of them (the US). 

But if you want some very minor western examples of this dynamic, look at the response to 9/11 and terror attacks. The Patriot Act and large scale surveillance, torture, extraordinary rendition, etc. Look at how the UK suspenses elections during the war. Look even at how neutered and submissive the opposition is being in the UK during the corona crisis. 

You honestly believe there aren’t far more US and western influences in Russia than the reverse? Lol. The dozens and dozens of state sponsored NGOs for a start. The sanctions. NATO lined up along its border. 

If you can’t see the cause and effect of US aggression, and particularly electoral interference (genuine interference, actually deciding an election) and further repression, I don’t know what to say. You can multiply this dynamic by a billion for smaller countries incapable of defending themselves, like Iran, Libya, Venezuela, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. Or whichever country dare defy US hegemony.

If you want to increase the chances of democracy flourishing in Russia, you should be doing the opposite of what you’re doing now. Critiquing US aggression, not doing its bidding.
