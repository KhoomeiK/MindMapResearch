He's what we would call a ""сељаче"". He literally is one, but more in the figurative sense that he fuck over our country when nobody wanted any of it.

He basically broke the laws, by changing poll ""rules"" mid-polls, stating they needed X % of population to vote for to pass it, and when it seemed like he'd lose, his party (СДСМ) went ahead and changed the conditions to X% of counted votes. That means he got the win anyway.

Nobody asked him to change our country's name, it just happened. And the day it happened, we were basically erased as a nation. The dispute over our name had went on for a long while, and finally, we got dicked by some random no-name, who basically threw away our history, name, pride, and similar things. He greeted the people without our national anthem, flags, or anything of cultural significance. 

Although no country is perfect, our country has the most corrupt politicians out of any I've seen. Bribing albanians in towns where there isn't much (or any) macedonian population is not much of a surprise at this point. Everyone knows they do it, and the opposing party (ВМРО-ДПМНЕ) found out before the polls that СДСМ had actually rigged them. Nothing much changed and no crazy controversy came out of it, just was talked a bit on the news. The worst part of this all is that they used bribing to get a leg up, and won by a few votes.

I want to share a group called K15. Those guys are legends, defying all and making fun of what they see fit. https://youtu.be/k3PG_NgSq_E

I suggest you check out every municipalty, and compare them to one another, especially to Arachinovo, Bogovinje, Lipkovo and Vrapchishte. Now by no means am I claiming that foul play was at hand here, but it really seems like it, compared to ""natural""-esque percentages in other municipalties.

I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this, especially from my own people and the neighboring countries. Feel free to ask me anything, I'll respond to best of my knowledge."

If you have none, start going around town, maybe a lounge bar or a sandwich place or whatever it is you have near you. You can start talking to people from what they have with them/purchased  at the place, or maybe even something completely unrelated. They might be taken aback, but if they're interested, they'll continue the conversation and maybe you'll get a contact out of it. The pub, or any drinking place for that matter, is a TERRIBLE idea. 

Unless you act like a complete dumbass and dipshit towards a girl you find attractive or her friends (even guys), you might have a chance at something with her.

A problem can arise if you find a girl who's obviously out of your league, i.e. a girl who's being hit on very often (her attitude would be like someone that's above others, or is super confident). But if you find a girl who's either one of these and acts like a c**t, then stay the hell away from that crazy. Never stick your dick in crazy.

Following the prev. paragraph, you best get yourself some semi-decent clothes, a nice haircut and keep that beard (if you have one) cut properly. You don't want to look like the kind of stalkers and creeps she'll find around town.

Additionally, your natural looks play a big role in this whole shabang. Girls are very picky and you should be the same, while also meeting the demand. Being charismatic, knowing how to keep a convo going and not showing too much fear are also a huge factor.

Whatever you do, don't act the way any of these people here on this board tell you to. Especially this: DO NOT BE ***THAT*** GUY - the r/niceguys guy. Rejected? Admit defeat and move on. Chances are, she wasn't for you. 

All of this *should* be viable advice for *most* girls you meet. You'll find all sorts of personalities and ""quirks"" with people, but you'll know which one's right when you talk and open up easily.

If you're dealing with anxiety, panic, and such problems, don't be afraid to seek help. I personally have used 7cups and the people there can really help you."
