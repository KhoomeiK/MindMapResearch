Currently undiagnosed but working with a therapist who's familiar with DID. So far I've got three alters who definitely have names that I can recognize? There's other less defined ones.

CPTSD,fmov8z7,t3_fwbzqz,1586269146.0,"Yup. Whether it's ten or twenty years ago. It doesn't matter. Even 5 is iffy. 

And on top of it at this point I believe one of the reasons I cannot work (there's a list) is because of how bad my memory is. For example my plan b option was too teach cause it would still kinda be in my field. My memory can't keep up with teaching a class week to week and remembering say 2 weeks ago."
Dissociation,fmmpmtm,t3_fvs3oq,1586209683.0,"Sounds like dissociating and then no longer dissociating.   


For me I'll sorta just wake up or take control or something, there's no good words for it. Sometimes I'm sleepy for no obvious reason, sometimes I feel like I'm not in the metaphorical driver's seat. I go from doing whatever I've been doing to being more present. I regain the ability to focus - like be able to read a book, think ahead/plan - like writing a to do list, notice how my body feels."
AskDID,fmm6vix,t1_fmm6j5l,1586199878.0,"See my other comment. Childhood Disrupted is a book about ACEs. It's even got a section about what you can do, similar to Body Keeps the Score, so it's not just depressing research."
AskDID,fmllevv,t1_fmlkzjd,1586188688.0,Also an excellent source but it can definitely be triggering depending on where you are in life. It doesn't cover ACEs specifically though.
