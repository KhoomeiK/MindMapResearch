depression,ffekyrd,t3_esrfmq,1579852431.0,"Dude look, I PROMISE you... If you push her away for good, you'll feel 1000x worse than you do now. Please think about that, it sounds like you have something good going on do not ruin it. Call/text tell her you love her and put behind whatever was said, I have BPD so I know how something small can really affect you emotionally. I'd kill to have someone love and care for me besides my parents. Good Luck!"

depression,ffejq9r,t3_et3doc,1579850860.0,"Eh, I been feeling suicidal to, I know how a relationship can heal that wound, I know how devastating it must feel to have that special someone up and leave you, shock, betrayal, etc. I dont want to say it'll get better ( though i hope it does ) because I barely believe that for myself but i just wanted to say i understand."
depression,ffej8p2,t3_et3snb,1579850260.0,"Yes, I want this also, for me I feel like I want a girl to hug, hold and lay in bed with binge watching netflix.

Me and my mom have a great relationship we've had our moments though, me and my father can be rocky at times. He's always been in my life but we just have very different personalitys.

BPD,fc1nco3,t3_eeqab4,1577323958.0,"You know, at first when I was younger having crushes and being in relationships would cause huge anxiety, paranoia. Not knowing if shes talking to another guy etc, but being single I'm at complete peace. I often wonder if I also have schizoid PD because that's how I feel when single, but as I get older I'm losing the ability to maintain relationships due to me losing interest. Like my defense mechanism went in overdrive lol."

AmItheAsshole,fboqh9j,t3_ee3e19,1577013267.0,"Na, life isn't like the movies or games. People DO get fucked up and or killed trying being a hero or vigilante. Even if you are a big strong guy who can fight, you had no clur if the guy was armed or not. Yes you could have called the cops at a distance but I understand this being frightening and you wanting to just get out. So NTA. You don't want to get put in harms way over a stranger."
