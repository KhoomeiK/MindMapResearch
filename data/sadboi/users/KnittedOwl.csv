She has tons of toys but doesn't engage with them much except the ones I get from meowbox and I have no idea what they do to those toys to make them so loveable. 

She had a cat tunnel but she used to play in it with the other cat and now won't touch it.

The way little space can go is different for a lot of different folks!

For some people little space is just a headspace where we go where we feel very childlike. During this time we can act little, do little things, and dress little. This can differ for everyone too. For me it took a long time to totally figure out what I liked. I was really quiet in the beginning when I opened up to my boyfriend. In the beginning it was a lot of cartoon watching because it was a safe start. 

For some people being little means having a partner who is like a caregiver (mommy/daddy). These can function in different ways in different relationship and not all caregiver relationships are sexual. 

A lot of it is about rules and guidance I know for many of us. 

I hope some of that helps.
