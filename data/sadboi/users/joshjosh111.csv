I would highly recommend you consider taking that higher paying job just until you pay off your debt.  You can do it!  Take the crappy job, get the money, pay off your debt in two years!  After that, you can relax and take a job you enjoy.  You are NOT bankrupt - THIS IS MANAGEABLE AND YOU. CAN. DO. THIS.  Trust.
Deep breath.  Here's what I think Dave would recommend you do regarding your debt:
1. Stop saving for retirement - everything possible goes towards debt right now.
2. Keep that $2k in the bank as an emergency fund.  Put it in a separate savings account.  Don't touch it - EMERGENCIES ONLY.
3. Pay minimums on everything (don't miss payments, obviously).
4. Pay every dollar you have left over from your paycheck towards the AMEX credit card - pay it off completely.
5. Celebrate with a bottle of (cheap) champagne - you've paid off your first debt!
6. Pay off the Capital One credit card completely.
7. Pay off the Citi Card completely.
8. Pay off the VACU card completely.
9. Pay off the VACU personal loan completely.
10. Pay off the FAFSA loan completely.

Put the family member loan wherever you need to in this batting order.  If they're cool with you paying them last, do it.  If they're cool with a monthly payment of some amount, do that.  

How does this sound?  What feelings are you feeling right now?  We believe in you!"
DaveRamsey,fo0hv0m,t3_g4zijc,1587413419.0,"For me, a month's expenses is already just the necessities.  Once I get to BS3, I'll calculate my month's expenses as those necessary expenses, plus $300 per month just in case.  Before I increase my lifestyle spending, such as by taking up motorcycle riding as a hobby, I'll increase my emergency fund to match my new lifestyle's monthly expenditures.  IF I end up having expenses that aren't necessary and can easily be cut (like, idk, weekly ski trips), then I'd exclude that when calculating my emergency fund.

Your emergency fund should be in a high yield savings account, or something similar - liquid and not volatile.  Excess money in your emergency fund could be going towards a better purpose (e.g. investing), so you should also avoid having an emergency fund that's needlessly big.
Just my two cents."

Sign up at Mint.com.  It's a free service (they make money by advertising banking products to you haha). Hook up all your accounts (bank accounts, credit cards, car loans, etc.).

It's only March, so start by going back to January 1st in the Transactions section. Make sure every transaction is categorized correctly.

Once you've  done that, you'll know exactly how much you've spent on various things - food, clothing, amazon, etc.

You obviously know what you spend on rent and what your car payment is. Using mint will show you what you spend on all that other crap.

Look at the expensive categories and focus on reducing the big ones.  Maybe you're spending way too much on food every month, or clothing.

You can then set budgets for every category in Mint.  Log in daily, and update recent transactions to make sure they're categorized correctly.  Look at the Budgets tab often - make sure you're on track for the month."
