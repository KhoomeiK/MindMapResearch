BitLifeApp,f1higq5,t3_d9e7ij,1569494179.0,"I understand your perspective on this, but if they paused on IOS updates tons of people would be pissed and apple users do make up quite a big percentage of players which they need to cater to to keep the app going and keeping players playing. As fun as app developing and making apps are, if you have a big app but nobodies playing and you're not getting anything from it because they're bored of it then what's the point? As an apple user, I personally don't care if our updates get put on pause for a while but many more people will, and as a small team of devs who've hardly/never worked on an app for android and having to keep up IOS updates then they're understandably having some difficulty and are doing their best I think.

Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention they hired a team of android developers to help get android updates out quicker:))"
MadeOfStyrofoam,f0mxhro,t1_f0msn5r,1568755367.0,Styro is all white on the inside of the cut with a slight gape/a gape typically no bigger than 0.5-1cm (from what I've personally experienced) while the very top layer of fat has these orangey-yellow bubbles on the inside of the cut which people consider 'fat bubbles' and will bleed a considerably larger amount than just a styro. Actual fat can look anywhere from orange to a dark red and you've probably hit a vein or arterial at this point so there would be excessive nonstop bleeding and probably a fairly big gape
MadeOfStyrofoam,f0mki8i,t1_f0mjv84,1568747056.0,"You're correct, it's technically the second layer however it is the first under the skin. When you cut deep enough to make a styro, the cut typically has a slight or wide gape depending on how far down into the dermis you reached and it will be white inside before gradually filling with blood. The whiteness you see is why these cuts are considered 'styro' because it looks a bit like styrofoam."
MadeOfStyrofoam,f0mj813,t1_f0mixjo,1568746220.0,"Styro is the second layer of skin, it's incredibly easy to reach considering the layer above (epidermis) is quite thin. However dermis (styro) is very thick whichs makes them way more painful because more nerves become exposed."
MadeOfStyrofoam,f0mg90r,t3_d5j4zw,1568744277.0,This is so true lmao the amount of times I've cut to styro and thought it was just a scratch until I actually went on sh websites and found out that definitely was not the case lmao
