TooAfraidToAsk,f0nj05e,t3_d5mckn,1568771346.0,I think that the simple act of slipping the ring on her finger while she was asleep falls flat without the background information you gave here. Not every couple spends that sweet time together falling asleep and it’s clearly something close to your heart. That’s what makes it an awesome proposal. You chose something meaningful for the two of you.

Casefile,esgd62a,t1_erblxuv,1561949637.0,Agreed
Casefile,esgd38m,t1_eraogar,1561949571.0,"She definitely stuck in my mind days after listening, too. “Help her and help me”? What the hell does that mean?"
Casefile,esgczzh,t1_erj6o99,1561949495.0,"I definitely got the vibe that the Restivos had dirt on the priest. Clearly he was doing things he shouldn’t have (even if not for the mattress, it’s apparent that he was a secretive dude) and that attic held more secrets than just Elisa’s body. She was a victim not only to Restivo, but to a corrupt system."
Casefile,esgcq4s,t1_erghei5,1561949275.0,It definitely seems that the priest was into some unsavory shit and they were trying to turn a blind eye to that church in general.
Casefile,esgcmdy,t1_erejmh6,1561949193.0,"You want to assume it’s separation of church and state (forgive me if that’s not a thing in Italy, I’m American) and just simple ignorance, but by the end you really begin to feel that it’s corrupt. And for what? A twerp of a kid at the time? Such a waste."
Casefile,esgc8e3,t1_er9gk45,1561948885.0,"No one should ever see their loved one like that, let alone a child and their mother."
Casefile,esgc6ye,t1_erbd4cq,1561948854.0,"Yes he said something along the lines of how Elisa’s mother had spent all of those years sitting in the pews, praying to find her daughter’s body and all along it was a floor above her."

SuicideWatch,es6snj8,t3_c5zms0,1561656450.0,"You’re absolutely not alone. Sometimes human interaction is just too much, even without all of the negativity that can come with it. Don’t be so hard on yourself! If you need to turn your phone off for a day, that’s okay. If you need to deactivate social media, that’s okay. It’s cliche but true, the ones that matter won’t mind and the ones that mind don’t matter."
SelfHarmScars,es6semv,t1_es547b7,1561656296.0,"Exactly. Start at home, then maybe short trips to the gas station or the grocery store, then maybe a longer trip like a lunch date. It’s too much all at once and that’s okay! If you ease yourself into it a little bit you might be surprised how much more comfortable you can become."

mvmtforher replied: “On occasion our models or photographers incorporate their own accessories in the pictures. We don’t sell those specific bracelets on our site and unfortunately we’re not sure where they’re from.” 

Any help is much appreciated!"
