AskReddit,fl7jmn9,t3_fn4o1x,1584903098.0,"Depends, i would assume that the dog would take the lions acts more seriously. I also would assume that the dog wouldn‚Äôt be scared if the lion was calm and willing to meet the dog ( cue the viral video of the dachshund licking a lions face, and the lion is just laying there )
like i said, if the lion was acting in any kind of aggression then the dog would know to stay away from confrontation and danger and possibly be afraid.
