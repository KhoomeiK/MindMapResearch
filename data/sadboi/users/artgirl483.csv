You don't have to decide to separate permanently right now. But please don't keep your kids in the same house with him if he is still using. Alcohol and drugs can cause good people to turn into nasty and scary people.

He has to want this too. To get clean. And from what  you've said, maybe he knows he needs to, but doesn't know how to live without it yet.

The next time this happens, don't clean up, go get the toy and then ask her if you can help her finish.  If she says yes, treat it with as much passion as penetration. Kiss her, grab her breast, talk to her. Cuddle for as long as she wants. 
I'm guessing that from her experience of not being able to climax, she is feeling like it is an inadequacy on her part, and maybe partially your part.  
To approach her, just go up to her and ask her something like, ""Are you upset about what happened the other day?"" 
As a woman, it can sometimes seem unfair that men get to come no matter what. Sex isn't over until my boyfriend comes, and it would be ridiculous to ask him with his full erection, ""Do you still want to come?"" Because the answer is ""OF COURSE!""
It also could be that she feel like you could hold off from coming, you just choose not to care.  There are ways to slow down sex, and make her come too.  It doesn't have to be all penetration. For her, it could be alot more about outer stimulation. My boyfriend makes sure I come before he ever enters me, not because I asked him to, but because he knows that it isn't fair if he's the only one who gets to come.  Try that.
Chances are, this isn't the first time she has felt this way. Which is probably why she's making it a big deal.  Either way, you need to just flat out ask her."

Anxiety,fnxcxrx,t3_g4eh5e,1587336114.0,"Talk to your dad about the idea that your sister may have some social anxiety, and find some actual educational material about it so that he doesn't think you are just making excuses for her.   Also, your sister doesn't have to have a diagnosis to work on it with a counselor. It is better to address it at 13 than to wait.  Chances are she's 13, and her self esteem isn't where it should be. Try to find ways to encourage your sister, and build her up.  I'm sure that she looks up to you in some way."
relationship_advice,fnxc9mn,t3_g47wjb,1587335728.0,"ALL of the photos? Isn't that a little excessive?  I don't know about your relationship, but with my boyfriend and I, if we ever want to know about a person in each other's lives, we just ask.  If there is anyone who flirts with me, I tell him. Not to make him jealous, but to create a sense of awareness in our relationship. If I want to know about the woman who he is talking to, I just ask, and he tells me I can take a look.  If we were both resistant to this idea, it would create a question as to if one of us were hiding something. And if I meet a man but he has no interest in spending time with me AND my partner, I have no desire to spend time with that man.  Not that it would always happen where my boyfriend was present, especially if we're work colleagues, but the man would have to be open to the idea if we were to want to just hang out.
As long as you don't act possessive, and approach each friendship with genuine curiosity, I wouldn't be worried about appearing jealous. However, if your girlfriend is resistant to you meeting ANY of the men in her life, you need to run.  That is a recipe for disaster."
TwoXChromosomes,fnv7oga,t3_g3nso2,1587283098.0,"I spent the first 33 years of my life developing crushes on guy friends who never thought of me as anything but a friend. It is a recipe for heartache.  Then I met someone who I met at a community gathering, and it wasn't a friendship, and it wasn't love at first sight either. It happened gradually, and four years later we are still together, we still cuddle, and we still say I love you before bed.  I spent so many years pining after men who didn't want me, and getting hurt...when if I just would have been patient, the person who saw all of the special things about me would have come along. I don't regret those experiences, but there is still a little ache in my heart for the girl I was, who wanted to be loved so badly. 
People always told me that I would find someone OP,   and I never believed them.  By 20, I started to think that I was unlovable.  But I wasn't. I realized that I developed crushes on my guy friends because they felt safe to me. And that is almost the exact reason why they didn't like me back, I wasn't exciting to them.  It doesn't matter how many times you get it wrong, it only matters the one time you get it right. Hopefully you don't have to wait until you're 33 like I did, but there are worst things in the world. I spent all of that time focusing on other things like going to graduate school, and being an awesome aunt to a gaggle of nieces and nephews. I wouldn't trade any of that stuff if it meant I could have had my heart broken a few more times.  Good Luck!"

If my bf's mom went through this much trouble, I would have watched that lasagna like a hawk. And if something did go wrong, I wouldn't call her about it, and let her know that her efforts were wasted. That in itself is thoughtless. 
I'm guessing this kind of stuff has happened before."

Anxiety,fnmspld,t3_g2jrq0,1587077427.0,"Honestly, sitting in isolation is the worst thing for panic attacks right now. I'm sorry that you are going through this. It really sucks.  I've found that the best way to get out of it is distraction. Find activities/people that you enjoy.  Watch some stand up comedy on Netflix or the computer (funny things really help me).  Find old songs, memories, movies that are your favorite and easy to watch).  Chat with people  who you know online.  Don't keep this feeling to yourself.  Go outside and go for a walk, or at least try to get 30 minutes of air and some sunshine. 
I've suffered from a panic disorder for over 30 years.  Just rest assured knowing that they are really scary but they do end.  Oh! And make sure that you monitor your breathing. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and let it out for 4 seconds...REPEAT!"
relationship_advice,fnl7o4j,t3_g20lfj,1587048569.0,"You were wondering how your wife could be addicted to food because of past trauma.  I have a response to this.  It doesn't have to be what you would consider trauma.  It can just mean that your wife uses food as a tool to cope with her emotions.  She could  have learned it from her family, she could have learned it as a coping mechanism when she was a kid.  She has a love relationship with food.  It is an incredibly diificult relationship/addiction to break. And you have to want to.  For people who are morbidly obese, only 5% of them will successfully lose the weight by diet and exercise. This leaves everyone else who is morbidly obese feeling like they are defeated.  Imagine being addicted to food, but having to eat to survive!  There is a book that might be helpful to you called When Food Is Love by Geneen Roth.  It really helped me understand emotional eating, and it could help you understand what your wife is going through. 
I was morbidly obese, but I didn't want to be. I tried exercising and dieting, but I couldn't stop eating. I had gastric Bypass surgery, and lost all of the weight. However, I couldn't eat what I wanted anymore so I turned to comfort with something else.  Three years after my surgery I was a full fledged alcoholic. Now, ten years later I am a recovering alcoholic, and I am my ideal weight. Behaviors are a cover up for feelings.  I hope that someone can explain these things to your wife in a way that she can understand."
relationship_advice,fnj5nor,t3_g1wsp3,1586992434.0,"I got my first and current boyfriend at the age of 33.  You can imagine that I would definitely want to get out there, and experience other people...I had been single for 33 years!  There are days when I wonder what it would be like. But that's just it.  I only wonder.  Because I know that I love my boyfriend, and that is what I have wanted my entire life.  
I blame your situation on your girlfriend's immaturity. And I ask you not to take part in it.  If she leaves to screw other dudes, your relationship will never be the same.  Even if she were to come back, you would still feel like she chose you second.   Nobody deserves to feel like that."

confession,fngeway,t3_g1gkke,1586930105.0,"Starting to drink this young, and so frequently...you are on your way to being an alcoholic. My boyfriend found the same joy in drinking so much at 13.  He was a heroin addict by the time he was 19.  I'm a recovering alcoholic, and I used to do exactly what you are doing.  It is fun to drink and be drunk.  But your tolerance will go up, or you will get bored of ""just alcohol"" and start to look for other things to give you that feeling. 
You're just a kid.  Your brain hasn't stopped growing.  You're changing your brain by drinking this young. And it will only cause you trouble. 
You need to find some activities that are fun and fit your age and maturity. You will definitely be an adult someday, you should save that activity for then."
Anxiety,fncjv86,t3_g0okqq,1586838612.0,"My SO and I both have panic attacks on the regular. Luckily, they never happen at the same time, or we'd be fucked. I internalize the experience, so others don't immediately notice, I just feel like I'm dying inside. The most I say is, ""I'm not doing well. "" It is much more difficult to watch him go through it, and watch him flail around, moaning and hyperventilating. It gives me anxiety just thinking about it. He is relatively new to it, where I have had it my entire life, and have taught myself ways to stick it out.  I feel really terrible about it, when it happens to him because he is legitimately scared and thinks that he is going to die. There is nothing that I can do other than to sit next to him.  It's very difficult to have a partner with the same mental health problems that I do, but when all said and done, it brings us closer together."

I'm sure she would've chosen a different path if she thought she had a choice.  Addiction makes you feel like you don't have a choice.

relationship_advice,fnajtvs,t1_fn9tqyc,1586798746.0,"It's time you do some research. Your daughter is going to flick the bean whether you take her sex toy or not. You need to stop caring about what is appropriate and what isn't based on your own perceptions of sex.  Your daughter took the initiative to find a toy, not a 15 year old penis. You should take that as a win.  
I didn't masterbate for the first time until  I was 25, because my parents and the church made me feel like I was sinning if I did that.  Once I figured out that all of my friends had gotten to do that for YEARS before me, I felt so cheated.  I feel sorry for my poor mother who has never done it. 
By allowing your daughter to do her own exploring with a sex toy, you are potentially helping her fill an urge that many girls her age turn to men for. 
Buy a vibrator for yourself and your daughter, and stop assessing the situation for appropriateness. Your husband crossed that line when he put his fingers on your daughter's sex toy."
relationship_advice,fnaicl6,t1_fn9sr33,1586798017.0,"I honestly think that OP should buy her a new one anyways.  1.

I would have a very hard time using a sex toy after my father had his judgy fingers all over.  She'll think of it everytime she tries to use it, and that's a libido killer."

In my experience sex is different between men and women, and there is a very strong possibility that she could have had feelings for you, had things progressed.  And to have someone around who you know would fuck you, is just an ego boost. And who's to say that she wouldn't have become appealing again at a time where your wife and you were arguing.   I think you made the right decision to extract that girl out of your life for the safety of your relationship.  That's what a mature adult would do.
People act all shocked when they don't put up boundaries in their relationship. 
And OP, your boyfriend is totally sleezy.  He's treating two people  in a way that he wouldn't want to be treated. For his own gain, and ego boost.  He sounds very immature."
