Although I agree with some of your points I actually can't get behind all of them. I don't mean to discourage any of the positive work you are doing for yourself. 

I know that a lot of times people already
have underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression which are exacerbated by weed, not the other way around. So weed should most definitely be cut out as a preventitive, not a cure.

Organized crime will literally remain the same regardless of weed. There are millions of drugs to sell and people to fuck over. That is a really bad argument.
