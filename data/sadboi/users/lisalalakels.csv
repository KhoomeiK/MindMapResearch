SuicideWatch,flf4hml,t3_f9d5go,1585097860.0,Yes. This is precisely it.
travel,fkp4wzt,t1_fkosp8c,1584401871.0,"I have no expert advice to offer, but if I, or one of my children, was living that particular dream, I would say a)check your travel insurance will cover you in these troubled times, b)discuss how you will feel being so far away from relatives who almost certainly will be ill to some degree, and c) decide if you would rather be looking at NZ‚Äô night sky and living your best life rather than quarantined in a version of England where people are hoarding loo roll and the pubs are going to close. I hope you have the best time and stay safe x"
travel,fkp3zje,t3_fjhjoz,1584401270.0,"I need to get back to the uk via Bangkok before anything happens to prevent it. After days of trying to contact Eva Air to bring my flight home forward, I finally got through and I am now awaiting confirmation that I can fly home this weekend.

I am nervous though. And honestly happy to receive opinions / reassurance (but hoping for informed views / hard facts)

Europe just closed its boundaries and Airlines are collapsing. I could travel home Wednesday with Thai Air but it will cripple me financially. Is it safe to wait it out until Saturday?"
relationship_advice,fef1kyf,t3_eoihfs,1579046021.0,Mate! üôà I truly hope date number two went well. I just stumbled across your post and was genuinely horrified that you had to add an update like that. I say that we should all fully appreciate a man who was obviously unprepared for your first date to end like that. And you should fully appreciate having that effect on him. Feel good about it and make him feel good about it!  I hope date number 2 went well.
MadeMeSmile,fef0455,t1_fe88ovl,1579045056.0,"Right then. I am officially offering to ditch my life / kids / job to come to your wedding as your doggies date. I will coax him down the aisle and then, afterwards, I will take him for a (very short)‚Äôwalk (because I am quite lazy) before snuggling the fook out of him and telling him repeatedly that he is the bestest doggo in the whole wide world."
ukpolitics,f4yhiz4,t1_f4yg23s,1571876698.0,Thank you.
ukpolitics,f4yheoq,t1_f4yh0pn,1571876639.0,"It seemed worth a shot, and yeah, I would take each view as skewed by personal experience. I was just looking for new perspectives. I didn‚Äôt factor in that doing so would put people‚Äôs backs up. Live and learn eh?"
ukpolitics,f4ygw3m,t3_dm88of,1571876380.0,That made me laugh and wish I hadn‚Äôt bothered x
ukpolitics,f4ygfnt,t1_f4yg7ed,1571876142.0,Just trying to hear opinions outside of the media hype. Already sorry that I asked. Forgive me for trying ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
ukpolitics,f4yg52p,t1_f4yfpql,1571876005.0,Tell you when you come back..
ukpolitics,f4yg213,t1_f4yf68d,1571875963.0,Ps all I got was ‚Äònews‚Äô stories and I was hoping for some sensible debate
ukpolitics,f4yfv13,t1_f4yfmyx,1571875868.0,"Thanks. Noted. But in all honesty, I live in a world where no bugger seems to like him so I wasn‚Äôt expecting a fan zone"
ukpolitics,f4yf68d,t1_f4yf24u,1571875590.0,I did. But thanks for your input
AskReddit,eymj5e5,t3_cxfyj1,1567210594.0,"It‚Äôs not! Without Hollywoods influence I wouldn‚Äôt even know what this question was about. I feel bad because I don‚Äôt even know if you mean the Civil war and, despite the movies, I‚Äôm not sure who were the baddies there either. It is sadly under-represented."
