So, I'm an addict.  I'm also bipolar.  (Hold on, I'm not making this about me.)  Oh, I should say that there isn't any abuse between either of us.  But, maybe this will be relevant...

My wife has been really heavily involved in Al-Anon.  I don't know how well 12-step programs are received around these here parts, but I know that they've been really great for us both (I do Narcotics Anonymous).  I mean, I'm still a crazy-assed addict, and she's still a control freak, but they give us a framework, and allowed both of us, from our respective programs, to establish boundaries.  We wouldn't be able to have any sort of relationship otherwise.

I'm sure that there is some 12-step program that will help you.  I'm hearing a certain amount of co-dependence, so, CODA (co-dependents anonymous.)  Al-Anon has way more meetings tho, and really, you don't have to love an alcoholic to take part in them.

They are about finding yourself, cleaning yourself out, and putting hard walls around who you want to be.  I have immense respect for the 12 steps, even though I don't adhere to them slavishly.

They can give you the strength and support to say no to what you've been saying yes to, and it sounds like that's what you are looking for.

Anyhow, this won't cost you anything to try.  Not in terms of dollars (euros, whatever) or soul-points.  Try a few different meetings, if one doesn't work, another one will.  When you're at a meeting, listen to what works for you and ignore what doesn't.

What I'm hearing is someone who can't establish strong boundaries and is losing sight of who they are.  That's fixable.

suboxone,fpmcb8m,t1_fpky22h,1588729984.0,"So, you're kinda right, but also kinda wrong.

The half life is indeed long, but there seems to be some non-linear effects at low doses.

"" The duration of effect may last for 6–12 hours at low dose (<4 mg) and 24–72 hours at higher dose (>16 mg). The longer effect at higher buprenorphine sublingual dose may be linked to sustained, effective drug levels for extended duration because of its slower elimination and enterohepatic recirculation (see [Table 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675640/table/t2-jpr-8-859/) for approved doses of sublingual buprenorphine). ""

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675640/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4675640/)

The evidence seems to support significantly different behavior at low vs. high doses, probably because of the long half-life and how quickly the opiate receptors clear up.  Which is why one person, who is dividing them up into smaller doses, requires the re-up.  See below:

"" Withdrawal suppression appears to require ≤50% μOR availability, associated with BUP trough plasma concentrations ≥1 ng/mL; for most patients, this may require single daily BUP doses of 4-mg to defend against trough levels, or lower divided doses. Blockade of the reinforcing and subjective effects of typical doses of abused opioids require <20% μOR availability, associated with BUP trough plasma concentrations ≥3 ng/mL; for most individuals, this may require single daily BUP doses >16-mg, or lower divided doses.

BipolarSOs,fnsmrdm,t3_g2qp1z,1587224784.0,"Hey so two things....

1) you have every right for this to be a total and utter showstopper.  Something to break up about.  Really, it's a fundamental incompatibility that might drive you crazy

2) you have every right to just go about your plans and let her fail.  You are not her mother and you should evaluate just how co-dependent you are being by doing all these systems and taking the responsibility.  I'd think you would want to be with a functional adult - and people don't get functional if you do all the functioning for them.  If she fails at work, then she fails at work.  And you shouldn't bail her out.

3) now, there are things you can do since you know this is an issue - like why would you schedule a couples therapy appointment at 9am on a weekend?  That's just asking for trouble   :)  Or really at any am time when you know mornings are issues?  Accept that morning stuff isn't going to happen and work around that 

4) even if you don't want to break up over this, live your life.  Make the plans and then leave without her.  It's really okay.  I know it is better to have your partner there, but it's even betterest when you don't have to drag them along.

5) don't bring up the stuff from the past.  Just live as if she isn't going to be on time, particularly in the mornings.  And if there is something you both agree is important and has to be scheduled in the am, be ready to go by yourself or not go.

Look, you seem lovely, and I bet she is as well.  Seeing  ""maybe it's her meds"" got me shaking my head.   Part of being an adult is managing this shit.  If she isn't managing it, it isn't important to her, period.  Or she would be trying lots of different things and not simply telling you how hard it is for her.   Failing lots is okay.  Not trying is a different story, And I think you know which category this falls in.

I am bipolar 2.  I struggle with stuff like this every day - but I actively look for solutions and if one doesn't work, I try another.  I never expect another person to solve it for me.  Help me, catch me when I fall, but walk on my own as much as I can, and if I'm not, then clearly working towards getting back there.

I gotta say that I think the idea of breaking up and getting back together multiple times is one that should be left in high school.  No offense meant.  It's like, if the relationship is such that breaking up seems like the right thing to do, then, well, move on.

Low arginine diets are also an important part of this equation.  Nuts, seeds, meat, legumes, seaweed all have significant arginine.

One thing I would be immediately concerned about is anything that acts as an anti-inflammatory interfering with the body's natural response to infection.  (There's a reason for fever, as I'm sure you already know.)

Pubmed doesn't have much high-level for lysine and virus.  It's all very low-level stuff, like ""CDR3α drives selection of the immunodominant Epstein Barr virus (EBV) BRLF1-specific CD8 T cell receptor repertoire in primary infection.""  What this means is that there hasn't been a lot of research just aimed at lysine and general anti-viral activity.

This one is interesting, it talks about how, in a particular induced form of pancreatitis (l-arginine induced), the "" L-lysine treatment attenuates pancreatic tissue injury induced by L-arginine by inhibiting the release of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and enhance antioxidant activity.

Jonathan Reinarz, on the other hand, has asserted that ‘in the irrational world of racist politics, foreigners would always stink and possess the potential to contaminate’.7 Whilst accepting that smell was used to indicate otherness or inferiority long before the eighteenth century, this article suggests that subtle changes can be seen in the way in which it did so. At the beginning of the eighteenth-century Native Americans were described as sweet despite their odorous way of living but by the end of the period outward stench was prioritized without ruminating on what lay underneath. By the early eighteenth century the perceived stink of the Jews, the foetor judaicus, had come to be seen as the product of hygiene and diet rather than a curse from god.""

BipolarSOs,fgpbsy6,t3_ezse8m,1581001569.0,"So, remember that a lot of the stories here have the phrases ""they refuse to take their meds"" or ""none of their meds work.""

I was a shitshow until I was properly medicated, and it tore my marriage apart.

However, I am really optimistic that I can be a happy, healthy partner.  But, I mean, I'm also crazy, so I would think that.  ;)

Bipolar people often have something really special about them.  A creativity and an energy.  That doesn't get killed with meds.  This isn't well documented, but this is why a lot of psychiatrists like bipolar folks as we are often exceptional individuals. (I follow most all the mental health subreddits, and the art on the bipolar subreddits is truly, truly exceptional.  And not just for ""mentally ill"" people, but in general.  I'm a writer, photographer, and musician.  I know mad successful business people.  Etc.)

That makes us really neat to be with.  It's certainly part of why my marriage lasted for 2 decades despite being unmedicated.  

I wish I could point at some data for you about this, so it didn't sound like I was fluffing my ego quite so much.  :). Don't get me wrong, it can be a horrible disease, and requires active management.

But, yeah, I know several successful couples.  But they all involve active management of the disorder."
