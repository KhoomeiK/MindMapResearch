BubbleHash,fiw1jri,t1_fiw0pt6,1582772950.0,"Making hash is a lot of them time self learning trial and error kinda thing, but 1) I'd reccomend not beating the weed up too much. 2) Always test wash your material before committing to a big wash. 3) Spray every micron screen and clean your hash with super cold water 4) always wash your screens with cold water and 99% iso before and after your using them and keep everything as clean as possible"
BubbleHash,fivznx6,t3_fa4lug,1582771696.0,"Get 3 buckets. One to hold the bags and one to wash in. Put your 220 micron in one and the rest in another. Wash in the 220 , drain the bag and put in the 3rd bucket. Then pour the hash water through your bags. Your results will be cleaner. You could even buy 2 , 220s.

I get my buckets at home depot, the white food grade"

rosin,fhgmjl7,t1_fhee94m,1581571422.0,"Well generally when hash makers say full spectrum when in respects to bubble, it means that all the microns of hash were used. A lot of the time the lower grade washes get put into the full spec hash . Not all though , some just becomes pipe hash. So by the 3rd cycle of washes the hash becomes less melty and isn’t kept with the A+ grade. But JEkillian isn’t necessarily wrong either"
