What I did was take a part my tamagotchi into 3 parts I think. 1 back part, 1 middle part, and 1 front part and I squeezed the front part until the faceplate bends or opens up slightly at the bottom, then I put a small screwdriver underneath to pop it open. The way I did it though dented the edge of the tamogotchi where the faceplate is put and if you're not careful it could break a small part off, which I did because I kind of forced it too much. It's not that bad though, it's just a small line of a chip. I find that it's worth it though because you can always get a case to cover what was hurt."

Psychic,fcrmbli,t1_fcqmena,1577903680.0,"For me, though. My heart used to feel empty, like literally empty when I experienced sadness or a deep sadness, I should say. There's a story to it, but I won't go into it.

I've experienced some odd things in my life, but I think you made me just realize something.

What I'm about to say is separate from that something, though. When I have a super close connection with someone I can feel if their performing more of an action from spirit, rather than an emotion of soul through certain feelings of heaviness or emptiness. At least, I think it's that. Correct me if I'm wrong, again.

I'm not sure how to put this, but sometimes when I feel the emptiness in my heart while I'm connecting with someone, all my other senses heighten and it gets easier for me to distinguish micro expressions. It's like a trade off in a way. I don't understand why it happens, but it happens.

When it's a positive connection, all I focus on is positive energy and feeling what the person feels even when at some point, its negative, but then I don't feel empty since the positive numbed out that emptiness."

Psychic,fcq3qiw,t1_fbrcahj,1577878069.0," I've experienced a psychosis before and I had a mask on, too. One represented an angel telling lies, and the other a demon telling the truth... In a way, they're sinners in my eyes. Depending how you look at it. In this state, I think you should accept that you're a sinner. You're not evil yourself, you just have a piece of evil in you and since this is all based on belief you probably should believe in the part that's good in you that represents the true good god. Once you find that piece, you hold on to it. Don't let the darkness plant seeds in you for them to overtake you. You still have hope. I haven't fully analyzed your entire story yet, but if you want a similar encounter with psychosis, I can share with you mine. I wish you good luck, feel free to reply back."

-Deals with possibly the devil or other self.
-*Spoiler* another route where a psychopath and sociopath with multiple personalities that are both voice actors manipulate a girl, but the girl possibly chose for her life to be that way instead of having the devil or her other self have her soul in the form of hallucinations.
-*Spoiler* Girl is actually experiencing psychosis, which means her entire reality is distorted. It doesn't get more trippy than that.
-LIE: The fact the main character's other self tries to tell the other people to put ear buds in her ears to escape the fact that she is crazy, which says she is lying to herself (She's actually hearing voices). However, it doesn't super directly state this in the ebook itself.

Unfortunately, it's a rough draft still in the works. It's available on google play, too as, ""ROUGH DRAFT OF IMPROVISION"".

Edit: The eBook is partly true and partly false."
