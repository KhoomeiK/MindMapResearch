Some people really do just need the right person to start actually considering having a child. Some people will never want children. Who knows what the results will be. But the problem is that its a gamble. Relationships grow out of the novelty and become work for both parties to maintain love and respect. If you have issues with him someday, will the desire to want children change? If so then what if its too late when that happens? I think personally the choice to have a child should be made by you and only you, not because its influenced by someone or the desire of someone else. Good luck :)"

And even if i normally want to do a certain thing but lets say im off late from work or its my day off or even just for no reason at all, i may not feel like doing it that particular day. So ill say so. To me, friendship is honesty and companionship but the companionship part should happen when you both feel like it. Its not naive to do things for others simply to be around them. Its genuinely a nice thing to do. But i dont think its completely fair to be upset or bothered when people dont do a thing even if they simply just didnt want to.

BipolarSOs,f5u9qsj,t3_dpallt,1572470269.0,"In my experience, there is nothing you can do to avoid triggering him. He WILL get triggered with almost anything, and as soon as you fix the temporary problem such as ""your driving"", something else will come up that will trigger him then. If you stopped everything you did and literally just breathed i would say he would eventually be triggered if nothing else was around to do so. The problem is not what youre doing and he doesnt understand that. The problem is something is not helping his irritability. If he is taking medication you should speak to his doc to see what they think can help with anger. He probably needs to have it changed. Best of luck. I dealt with this for 2 years with my husband who had also self medicated all his life with weed. It doesnt work. It helps alleviate it temporarily for him but makes him super manic and the crash happens after. He is now taking meds and this is the first time i havent seen him angry at anything. In 2 years. It'll get better, and make sure you take care of yourself. Being patient is one thing. Taking abuse is another."

Most of the time though, yes they already reported it to your credit. As soon as it hits the agency, they tend to report it within 30 days. Or it could be that tmobile will report it and not the agency which is super common. I would dispute it with the credit bureaus by sending letters to them, and dispute it with the agency. Sometimes they help but sometimes they dont. Definitely dispute it with the credit bureaus yourself though. And the sooner its paid the better.
