He seems to understand both perspectives"
BPDlovedones,fqp201d,t1_fqmu16j,1589532177.0,"Talking about her ex or her? I wasn't really friends with him, I was very much against their relationship(the main issue being her kid whos wellbeing I cared for a lot) and while there's some 'well yeah at least he was honest' I can't think anything other than wow what a fucking idiot, to disregard his, her, my and the kids wellbeing for sex. Dude had a decent job and prostitution is legal here if that's all he wanted, I don't believe for a second that he legitimately thought he could make things work."
BPDlovedones,fqmrs80,t3_gjojjz,1589482448.0,"\>this person won't believe you since they're being love bombed and cumming their brains out so there is no penetrating (Pun not intended) their minds

I was friends with someone with BPD and I'll never forget sitting down with one of her partners, explaining that things will never work(he was younger/too immature, first serious relationship, didn't read up on BPD, she had a kid and he just wasnt fit for that role at all etc) and basically saying things will end in complete disaster in 3-6 months. I'll never forget, and it almost makes me laugh now, he replied with ""yeah things are bad sometimes but there's some things in the relationship that are really good"" - that being the sex. Things ended in complete disaster exactly 3 months after that, with him losing his job, most of his friends and becoming suicidal and her being a complete mess

&#x200B;

but the sex was good.

Anyway the person I know is upfront about their BPD so anyone that opts into it has already been given all the warning they need, I'd never feel inclined to reach out to anyone involved with your ex unless she keeps her BPD secret and you feel she is manipulative but even then I'd guess it's 90/10 the guy listens in any relevant capacity."

\>Is there any hope of her fixing her BPD? 

&#x200B;

BPD doesnt just go away, it lasts for life and there is no 'cure' - Years of therapy means they can be better but BPD by nature means you won't seek out therapy, so a very small % get to the point of their BPD being 'fixed'"

""my ex was abusive"" is almost universal from them, and then a few months or however long in you get hit with ""you're being just like my ex!"" and since you've believed them up until now, you believe it."

I do want kids of my own eventually, there's some attraction to the idea of someone that is a mother as well and I feel my chances would be better since we'd have stuff to relate to - Like I don't watch many movies outside of disney/kid stuff, so that conversation is far more likely to go somewhere with a someone with a kid rather than not.

Thanks, that seems to be what I was going for with the LTR/great uncle-babysitter part."
Tinder,fpvefvu,t3_gdxd1p,1588942917.0,"What are the general thoughts of a 'great with kids' or similar line in a bio? I'm 27/M, have 10 nieces/nephews and am very accustomed to being around kids

Someone not wanting or already having kids wouldn't be a dealbreaker it's just a slight preference, is it worth mentioning to be upfront about that or will it butcher my chances with everyone else/just sound like I might be a creep?"
