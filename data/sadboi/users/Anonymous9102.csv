malefashionadvice,f7n7ck3,t3_dwtn99,1573887576.0,"Which shoes should I buy?

My first choice is the [SF AF1 Mid ‚ÄòRed Ivory‚Äô](https://imgur.com/a/d2RzIgY). 

Second is the [SF AF1 Mid ‚ÄòOlive Ivory‚Äô](https://imgur.com/a/aMd3g9O)

And last is the [Blazer Mid ‚Äò77 Vintage ‚ÄòPacific Blue‚Äô](https://imgur.com/a/TkXhfCD). Blazers, specifically OFF-WHITE Blazers are pretty expensive right now, and my budget is $150 CAD ($110 USD). 

I was considering the [AF1 Mid ‚Äò07 LV8 White Black](https://imgur.com/a/gCsglxb), but those are up for $300+. 

All three of these shoes fit my outfits pretty well. I wear a blue bag everyday, so the blazers would be perfect, but they‚Äôre a tad bit expensive. 

The SF AF1s are great for all seasons - summer, fall, spring, and early winter (light snow). 

If you could help me choose out of my list or there are any other shoes that you would suggest, that would be appreciated as well.

I considered plain AF1s - black or white - but I‚Äôm looking for something with more accent or detail."
