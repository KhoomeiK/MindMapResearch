To me gaming is either a hobby for some, and a job for some others

It‚Äôs perplexing that there‚Äôs a subset that refers to themselves as hardcore gamers - just because they play more than others

The same could be applied to other hobbies/careers, such as:

Photographer/Professional Photographer - but there‚Äôs no such thing as a hardcore photographer 

Athlete/Professional Athlete

Gamer/Professional Gamer

It just feels a bit, egoistic that‚Äôs all - the same way some of us promote superiority over other for playing on specific consoles/platforms over others

Next with Lightroom I find that the Dehazer slider is very handy in cutting some of that light pollution out

And am I the only one imagining that the horizon is slightly tilted right?"
MINI,etnj7gv,t1_etngd6x,1562988938.0,"Awh don‚Äôt worry, I felt exactly that way when I knew mine was defective, but you know what, there‚Äôs way way worse of a defect out there that we‚Äôre lucky we don‚Äôt have

Just enjoy the car ü•∞"
MINI,etnfihr,t3_ccjo6u,1562985659.0,"Ah mine came  off too, makes an awful rattling sound and you‚Äôll notice that your rear view mirror is all loose

At first i tried to push it back in, it will work for some time, and then it pops back out

Repeated this a few times until it won‚Äôt pop in again

My fix? Remove the rear view mirror assembly, and throw out that ring. Wrap the ball joint with some masking tape (white paper tape), ensure it fits snugly and you‚Äôre done

Now the rear view mirror should be firm again and no unnecessary rattling

I heard that this is a pretty common issues for a certain batch of em, something like a defect"

Edited on VSCO for iPhone (RAW)

I spent yesterday just strolling the beach, enjoying the sunlight, and saw a mother and child playing together and thought it looked very nice, thus the overall warmer tone 

I have always struggled with photography, I don‚Äôt have a talent for it, but I enjoy it. So I just keep going on, even though more often then not the photos are....much less than stellar

Please do give me ideas for room of improvements. It can be anything and everything, I just want some honest feedback

Oh and on the editing, I have always used Lightroom prior to using the X100F (had a D7000 for 5 years before ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù to an XPro-1)

I found myself relying too much on curves and highlight/shadow corrections that I keep saying ,‚ÄùAh I can fix that in post‚Äù. So now I‚Äôm going to minimal colouring and editing, trying to get it right in camera."

I went through my library and there a slightly more overexposed shot, if you‚Äôre interested I attached it 

Thanks for your feedback, the photo does look better to me"
