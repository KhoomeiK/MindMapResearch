I could take her back for a re check but it was a 300 appt and I cant be dropping that all the time without reason. It's been 2 plusmonths since I took her in. She continued to be a little stir crazy for awhile,  then  out of nowhere resumed her normal behavior. Eating like crazy again. Basking, chilling. Seems perfectly healthy. I'm chalking it up to just hormones maybe preparing for eggs but it never fully developed?  Or they reabsorbed?  Super stressful though. Hope yours doesnt cause you too much grief.

There certainly must be plenty of seamstresses/ clothing company that could do this?"
Coronavirus,fl1kach,t1_fl15n51,1584730678.0,This is a great idea! Even cloth masks should be able to be cleaned like the surgical gowns. Disposable filters are still available and can be used for a longer duration than the single use masks. Meaning you could transfer out your filter to your next cloth mask as you go room to room. Seems it would stretch the supplies much further.
Coronavirus,fl19c41,t3_flvu7k,1584724524.0,Is there a reason reusable masks are not being using during this shortage? Could disposable filters be placed in the pocket of reusable masks and then that same filter reused in a new reusable mask when necessary? The masks could be washed regularly like hospital gowns and since the filters can be used for an entire shift (I would assume) it would stretch out the supplies longer. It seems more cost effective in the long run as well.

But I have a history of addiction to pain pills and it makes me uncomfortable that I'm not being truthful with my drs about it. And also nervous about increased tolerance/use.

I suppose there could be negative impacts with abuse like with anything else. And it may affect others differently, but I have experience with both prescription opiates and kratom and kratom is definitely the lesser of two ""evils"" when it comes to addictive potential and any sort of impairments. So when someone is in pain so severely that they consider suicide, I think telling them to research a natural and less harmful way to alleviate their pain is appropriate."
