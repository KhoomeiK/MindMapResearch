dating_advice,fgtyzkb,t3_exmxu8,1581111235.0,"ah i‚Äôm a female and i am going through the exact same thing rn, so i completely know how much this predicament hurts, especially at our age and seeing your friends fall in love and constantly get hit on. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to do, but i think the best thing we can make of this situation is to surround yourself with loved ones and try to be as socially active as possible (join extracurriculars if you‚Äôre in college, make initiative with current friends, etc) which i‚Äôm admittedly not great at either, all the while keeping busy. also congrats on the weight loss, that‚Äôs amazing! Definitely feel proud of yourself for it."

dating_advice,fettkoq,t1_fetr77c,1579379914.0,"I‚Äôm sorry you experience this as well. Online dating can be the worst at times, and while I want to give it up completely, I feel like lately it‚Äôs the only way to really meet people anymore in our generation. And thank you for your positive words. I struggle a lot with self-esteem and admit I have a tendency to feel inferior quite often. 

And thank you!! Wishing you the best of luck with your life and dating endeavors as well :)"
dating_advice,fetsyk3,t1_fenadzv,1579379699.0,"Thank you so much for your kind words, I greatly appreciate it. I definitely admit i fall victim to comparing myself to others a lot, especially in terms of leagues and when i see my friends with relationship success.  I‚Äôm also hoping that having a fresh start can help me out as well. I may also send a message at some point to chat, thanks for letting me reach out :)"
dating_advice,fecxtht,t1_fec4811,1578989000.0,"In the same boat as you right now, and I'm so sorry you are going through this too. As someone who's not ""conventionally attractive"" especially being a taller female, I've experienced getting blown off and ghosted so many times, and sadly it still hurts. As a shy person, loneliness and inability to connect with anyone has been something I struggle greatly with too, and I wish you the best of luck with finding someone. You sound like an amazing person who deserves love"
dating_advice,fecxomz,t3_eo3d6q,1578988832.0,"Vent: After being single for so long, all the while stuck in the endless loop of casual dating and ""situationships"" for years, all the while getting ghosted several times in this period, I just wonder when things will get better for me. I'm moving across the country in half a year after I graduate college, but I still fear that the same thing will continuously happen to me. As a result, I continuously wonder what's wrong with me, if I'm not pretty enough, a good enough conversationalist, etc. To make matters worse is seeing so many happy couples or friends of mine who's had several healthy relationships.

I just want to love and be loved and hate all the stress and frustration dating has been."
