I was helping a neighbor clean out her rental trailer after evicting tenants for nonpayment. The entire trailer was trashed an gross. There was a garden tub filled with empty Spaghettios cans and molded Tupperware.

But worse than that was the guest bathtub where we found the Poop Lasagna. This bathtub was completely filled with layers of towels and feces. Towel, shit, towel, shit.

I am very haunted by it and have so many questions. The main one being: fucking WHY?!?!"
