Anxiety,fnn6u4d,t1_fnmteeg,1587085679.0,"I haven't had the illness nor flu this year, but I did start with a sore throat this week.  I also became concerned.  But I nearly forgot - it's Spring!  Are you in a location where the trees are blooming?  Think it could be allergies?"
Anxiety,fnjgzxt,t3_fj2y1a,1586998784.0,"A personal story: last month we were advised that one of the staff members in our school had tested positive.  We were all worried of course, but we were unsure as to who it was.  Since we heard nothing more, we assumed they were doing well and we all hoped symptoms were minor.

Today, that staff member sent an all-staff email revealing themselves.  If I were to vote one person in our school to NOT get sick, it would have been them.  They've been battling a serious illness for the last year.  They recently had a kidney replaced.  And they also happen to be a parent of one of my students.

Well...they're fully recovered!  They had two stays in the ICU and things were quite intense.  But they did it!!  They're home, they're safe, and their family is all healthy!!!!"

Anxiety,fnbs2bg,t3_fj2y1a,1586821195.0,"I've been following the Instagram account of a woman who ended up having BOTH of her parents test positive and end up in the ICU.  Her parents are very similar to mine in terms of underlying conditions.  So I've been checking in on her account everyday.

Y'all...her dad has been home for a week and her mom is coming home today!!  I've never met this woman but I sobbed.  I thanked her for sharing her very scary journey.  So much hope."
teaching,fjxkpji,t3_ff7atd,1583676494.0,"I don't know if it's possible for you to do it from this perspective, but I was doing student teaching for 8th grade a few years ago and was tasked to teach WW1.  I should note that is was given a TON of flexibility, so here is what I did:

The War at Home.  Since it was a US history course, I had students analyze how the War abroad affected us at home economically, culturally, and demographically.

You can DM me and I can send you the Google Site I created for it if you're at all interested."
Twins,fc8r04l,t1_fc7o0ua,1577540426.0,Lol I dug into your post history justttt to make sure.  I guess you also just happened to gift your SIL with the greatest gift this Xmas!
NewMomStuff,fb2lm1t,t1_faxnr2z,1576453283.0,The mattress on an angle worked for us as well!  Best of luck.  This will pass!
PaleMUA,fa8lt8o,t3_e7zk8k,1575849209.0,I genuinely LOVE them.  I bought my first well over a year ago and I'm still working through the tube.  I also have cool undertones and I use Haze and Puff.  The other colors have too much orange in it for my tone.
AskReddit,f9l0r7u,t3_e5k1s6,1575411849.0,"A bottle of wine from my God Mother.  It was for my 11th birthday.  6 months late.  She 'fell asleep' when she handed me the gift.

Addiction is hell."
braces,f2go5k0,t3_dddqlx,1570233235.0,"Checking in here at 30!  You're right, it will be totally worth it.  I just wrapped up week two and I can already see significant movement."
BabyBumps,f1k3b1i,t3_d9jbic,1569531244.0,"We did the same and got the same push back!  Heads up - we were always told we would receive more clothes than we would ever need.  But since we didn't tell anyone which set of genitals our baby had, then did NOT buy any clothes.  If you have a registry, I recommend putting some onesies on there.  We had a mad rush to get enough for the first few weeks."
braces,f13bu56,t3_d7m6tq,1569157905.0,"I'm 30 and I just got mine a few days ago.  I also started retinol this month, so here's to possibly being carded forever!"
braces,f02zw5a,t3_d3h9rx,1568341554.0,"Omg this is awesome!  My teeth look very similar to yours, we're the same age, and I'm about to get braces!

This is really inspiring.  I also checked your post history and cannot believe how fast you progressed.  Keep posting!"
fitpregnancy,f02mcvt,t1_f01oyrv,1568333753.0,"This was also me!  I gained 40lbs total.  In the three years prior I had lost about 50lbs.  All my other friends who happened to deliver around the same time as me had the weight just fall off and I expected the same.

My weight didn't budge.  I didn't even lose the 7lbs 2oz of my ACTUAL BABY so it was clear I was gaining weight.  This was even well after all my swelling went down.

But OP, remember all those good habits you developed to lose the weight originally?  It'll be like riding a bike.  It took me almost two months, but that time was spent giving my baby all the attention and nourishment he needed.

I'm 8 weeks out from a c section and my nutrition and exercise is coming back to where it was all before the first trimester nonsense totally changed everything.

And yes, it is so much easier mentally as you start to show!  To be real - I did not enjoy being pregnant.  It was very uncomfortable and I didn't enjoy how limited I felt.

But now I get to walk around with this person I made and getting stronger everyday!

Good luck and it will be worth it!"
Teachers,eyjtxtu,t3_cx7yoc,1567128162.0,"Our head of school sent out a staff GChat to see if anyone wanted any extra chicken patties leftover from lunch.  I literally got up from staff lunch and headed my 8-months-pregnant self straight to the cafeteria.  

I came back into the room where my fellow teachers were eating lunch.  A colleague says, ""I see you took the chicken patty offer"".  I respond with a VERY enthusiastic, ""FUCK YEAH!""

What I did NOT see was that a 5th grader happened to join us for lunch during my chicken patty trip.  I had no words.  I immediately went to the bathroom to compose myself.

To this day it is a running joke and it doesn't seem like the mishap ever made its way up the ranks.  

I REALLY sweat that one."
historyteachers,ew31fss,t3_cmkr7l,1565061359.0,I'd recommend mystery hangouts!  I taught geography to 5th and 6th grade last year and the hangouts were by FAR the highlight of the year.  The toughest part was finding a time that worked with another class somewhere in the world.
BabyBumps,eupvtd9,t3_ch27a9,1563965393.0,"I'm very much with you.  I had a pretty traumatic birth that ended in an emergency c section.  We almost lost my son and myself.  I didn't realize how difficult the healing process would be, both mentally and physically.

We've had a ton of people come by and visit him, which I get to steal a short nap here and there.  I'm usually alone when I start thinking about the birth and how I haven't grappled with it yet.  My best friend (who is a social worker) asked me how I was doing.  I finally cried and was honest about not being totally sure and none of this feels real.

I saw another commenter say that there are thousands of us in here who can empathize.  I've reached out regularly to my July bumpers group and it's made a world of difference.

You're not alone and we know how hard this is!  Don't let yourself disappear in all of this.  You made a human, but you're still a human."
breastfeeding,euledlz,t1_eukahgg,1563900274.0,This is incredible.  Congratulations :) You all earned this.
pregnant,etp9tgy,t3_cct70c,1563049631.0,"Mine are significantly darker than they were before I was pregnant.  I got married almost a year ago, so I have plenty of comparison pictures.

Truly?  I have no idea why it happens or how to change it.  I'm assuming it has something to do with hormone increases and will likely level out after the baby arrives."
gardening,et85hq4,t3_cadim1,1562547079.0,"This is great!  Are these a hard neck variety? 

 This year was my first attempt at braiding and I got real lazy, real fast and gave up the braid."
pregnant,erle57c,t1_erl99q9,1560984806.0,"I second the protein shake recommendation.  I had the same aversions during the first trimester.  Now, sadly, they're back again in the third.  Keep a nice stock handy!"
Teachers,erlde64,t3_c2kwkb,1560984262.0,You were me last year!  Even down to the content/grade level.  This past year was the BEST!  Enjoy it!!!!  Congrats again!!
pregnant,erbjb7g,t3_c15kcx,1560683209.0,"Yes.  The way I explained it to my friends was that it felt like I was nauseous all the way down to my cells.  I would also regularly sleep 12 hours straight, and still nap during the day.

You got this.  I cried so much the first trimester, somehow feeling guilty for not being able to do anything.  Mine didn't really let up until 20 weeks.

But now my baby is expected to arrive any day now!  Pregnancy is much more difficult than I ever imagined it would be.  Hold on, accept help when offered, and suddenly you'll look back and wonder how time passed so quickly."
weddingplanning,eqdcmv7,t3_by13a6,1559987146.0,If it wasn't just after 5am where I am I would've SCREAMED!  This is incredible!  Congrats!!!
BabyBumps,eot0451,t3_bt0nu4,1558832651.0,"I've recently been in a more angry place as well.  If it's any reassurance, I was about to hang out with friends but turned around as soon as I got to the location.  I knew I wasn't in a good place to be around people.

I think it's a great thing you can identify this issue.  I have no advice.  Pregnancy is the strangest thing I've ever experienced."
