depression,fmo51gy,t3_fw9pw4,1586245636.0,I 100% feel the same
depression,fmo4wi4,t3_fw8ol6,1586245495.0,This is exactly how I feel right now. A never ending cycle of trying to convince myself that I can pull myself out of this pit. Trying so hard to be positive but always ending up with the damning realization that I can‚Äôt seem to figure out life
hardshipmates,fmo1h7z,t3_fsw5nk,1586241966.0,Hi! I will send you pm :)

wedding,fl5meir,t3_fmqfgo,1584840234.0,"Your dress is absolutely stunning! you will get to wear it, we will come out of this frightening time. I am also scared as We had to postpone our wedding as well and we are living with one income as well and trying to figure out what will happen. Please hang in there  know you are not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è"
wedding,fl4p2og,t1_fl4oiuv,1584818263.0,"I love the way you described it as a social and spiritual marriage, that is beautiful. I also love the idea of two separate vows and two anniversaries.

raisedbyborderlines,ff2kcrw,t3_dorl26,1579510121.0,"I tried through a text because I knew talking on the phone wouldn‚Äôt work. She had already been not talking to me for a couple months. She didn‚Äôt respond. But, for myself, it felt like some type of closure, or a setting of a boundary that I previously could never do before."
CPTSD,fdwls0m,t3_en5vf9,1578759987.0,Woah..this makes sense
CPTSD,fdttg5z,t1_fdtnasf,1578721928.0,"Try googling cognitive reframing, I think you will find something that will explain it better than I can. Hope that helps!"
CPTSD,fdtn23t,t1_fdq2ax9,1578719146.0,"I only was able to go a couple times because it was part of my college, but she had me practice stoping and think about why I feel the way I am feeling and instead of reacting negatively, to counter by saying something to offset it. Not necessarily just any super positive statement  that feels inauthentic, but something with more kindness and compassion towards myself. Also did this through journaling as well."
CPTSD,fdtmdg5,t1_fdpvnya,1578718853.0,I like ‚Äúemotions are data; not directives‚Äù that‚Äôs helpful and remaining curious is a great tip. Thank you!
CPTSD,fdptpzb,t1_fdptevo,1578640102.0,"Wow. I feel so similar to this, I went to a therapist a couple times and realized that my childhood was traumatic. I really didn‚Äôt understand how much verbal abuse and general neglect affected me...until the therapist mentioned that I tend to react as if my normal emotions are bad.. so I really feel you on the sitting and feeling your feelings."
BPD,fcpvvkb,t1_fcpgptg,1577873266.0,Me too I hate myself
BorderlinePDisorder,fcpvr92,t3_ehnycs,1577873192.0,I feel this :( it‚Äôs so hard for me to look into peoples eyes

BorderlinePDisorder,fcdfgi2,t1_fccfu15,1577609498.0,Me too :(
BorderlinePDisorder,fcdfdrn,t1_fcc4ues,1577609471.0,"I can relate, I feel like anytime I express my opinion on something that isn‚Äôt what the person I‚Äôm talking to believes, I obsess over it later and feel as if I was rude or disrespectful even though I simply politely disagreed, any debate=argument in my mind...even though I know it wasn‚Äôt really, I still beat myself up as if I was over the top or aggressive."
BorderlinePDisorder,fc7e6dw,t3_egktb1,1577504769.0,I feel this 100%
BPD,fbvwa0r,t1_fbvu5ld,1577136999.0,I should try this! Really good point. Have you decided you want to be sober from alcohol? Or how do you handle these situations when you do drink and become aggressive? I‚Äôm really struggling with this
BPD,fbvolci,t3_e3eytd,1577133814.0,"Wow, I commend you for being so dedicated to working on yourself to commit to a well thought out strategy. I always feel like I don‚Äôt understand how to identify how I‚Äôm feeling, like where these feelings come from. Everything feels so overwhelming and confusing, I hope I am able to get to a place like you did and figure out a path to take."
BPD,fbvlwu1,t3_e4ymkh,1577132706.0,"Oh my god I completely feel this way and I wondered if anyone else did. I currently am feeling so depressed about drinking yesterday. I never really drink and when I do, I overshare and become aggressive in mostly political things and generally just can‚Äôt shut the fuck up and really hate myself and find myself in suicidal ideation. I think I never want to drink again then I always end up saying one drink isn‚Äôt bad, and still have a horrible time. I‚Äôm really done and I think drinking just isn‚Äôt for me."
wow,fbcnorx,t1_fbaabk4,1576728424.0,"Honestly I do not understand this comment at all. The point of buying gifts for people is to be thoughtful and consider what they would really want. he never buys himself anything that is high quality. He currently has over the ear headphones that are a very cheap quality like $20. When buying a Christmas present for his parents that was pretty expensive, he made a joke and said wow, I buy other people such expensive gifts but I get myself cheap headphones. So I‚Äôm sure, from the comments of others here, that the most suggested headphone would be the best bet. Also, have you never heard of a gift receipt? 


Lastly....why would someone buy pants 3 sizes too big? That‚Äôs quite a strange analogy. I would hope someone would check someone‚Äôs size before purchasing pants 3 sizes larger...and once again..gift receipt?"
wow,fbb1xqa,t3_ec9sqm,1576691585.0,Thank you all so much!
wow,fba1jsj,t1_fba0f6v,1576659628.0,Yes thank you for these questions. I would like to spend around $100.He does need a mic and private would be preferable. He currently uses over the ear headphones.

depression,f7xegce,t3_dtn583,1574054539.0,"Hey I 100% know how you feel. I have dealt with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I spent my whole life feeling like an idiot repeating pre algebra over and over and over and going to a continuation high school. I am also in my mid twenties still trying to finish college and I felt exactly the way you do. Please don't give up, even if it feels hard. If you want to go to school do it, if not don't feel like you have to. I had to take 4 math classes that didn't count to transfer, just to get to the level needed to transfer. I went to the tutor lab over and over and over and did what I needed to meet requirements, now I'm closer to graduating and still feel these similar feelings as you deep inside me. Please give yourself a chance, you can do more than you think you are capable of."
