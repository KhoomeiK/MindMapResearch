schizoaffective,fn8ps1f,t3_fy1v9a,1586747162.0,"Wow, your post sounded a lot like my history. I was diagnosed with bipolar I when I was a freshman at college. Prior to going on psychiatric medicine, I was experiencing delusions and hallucinations, as well as depression. The medicine they put me on mostly cleared it up. But fast forward 12 years, and everything started to fall apart. I kept getting delusions in between mood episodes. I switched psychiatrists, and with my new pdoc we realized that my psychosis was occurring outside mood episodes, and it was getting worse and more self-violent and scary. Also, I would get the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, too. Look those up when you get a chance and see if they resonate. People I know, people who were close to me, were reporting that I had a flat affect, no tone of voice, if I could speak at all, like I was frozen. It wasn’t the same thing as depression. It sounds similar, but it’s not.

Finally late last summer my pdoc and I realized SZA was the accurate diagnosis, and that I’ve likely had it all along, but the psych med combos I was on for years must have mostly got it in a spot treatment kind of way. One way we knew was by bumping up my antipsychotic from a bipolar dose to a SZA dose. Bye bye psychosis! At least for a little while. The fact that my psychosis was responding to the kind of dose you’d prescribe for someone with a psychotic disorder and not to a bipolar dose was like the final piece of the puzzle. 

Like you, bipolar was a big part of my identity. I wrote about it widely and was open about it. People knew me as an advocate for it. So I’m still in the process of revising that public identity. 

It sounds like you’re really on top of all this and are advocating for yourself. Keep up the good work! Feel free to message me if you have any q’s."

Now I’m back on it at 3 mg. Don’t know if it’s doing much. Doesn’t give me too many side effects except overheating. I take it earlier in the night this time around, so I don’t risk the insomnia. Then again I’m also on 800 mg of Seroquel XR, which I think is high enough to put an elephant to sleep. At that high dose, I can’t even walk, so maybe Vraylar insomnia doesn’t stand a chance.

schizoaffective,fm8jcas,t3_ftkjju,1585850426.0,"For me, it’s very tough lately. I just cannot get stable for more than a week or two at a time. I have an excellent pdoc, and it’s still challenging. We volley back and forth between treating symptoms...as soon as the schizophrenia symptoms like psychosis go into remission, the bipolar symptoms emerge. We treat them, but as soon as I’m stable on the bipolar front, psychosis and negative symptoms come back. And on and on it goes. 

I’ve only been officially diagnosed with SZA-BP since last fall, but I was treated for bipolar I and borderline for 13 years before that. I’ve been on psych meds for 14 years, tried a ton of stuff, developed tardive dyskinesia in the process, and now am going on clozapine—I guess I’ve officially met the “treatment resistant” criteria. I’m hoping this med will work.

I do want to clarify: I don’t always feel as hopeless about my mental health as I do right now. And I’m grateful I’m on disability now and have much to be thankful for. But I won’t lie that right now I feel at my most discouraged. Mania and hypomania sometimes convince me that I’m cured, that it’s all a big mistake or misunderstanding.

When all else fails, I just try to think about what’s actually in my control. Usually, not much! That can feel freeing, if you let it—when it’s all said and done, there’s not much we can do! And then I work on something I can control physically, like working with my hands to bake.

schizoaffective,fksxnoj,t3_fka6fo,1584500849.0,"I’ve been pretty open about it on social media, maybe too much. I “came out” of the bipolar closet a few years ago when that was my diagnosis. I write about my mental health as a blogger and in my freelance writing. I just decided to make myself available to others with mental health issues or their allies as a resource. I felt like living openly and educating people was better, for me, than hiding it. Not that I pass myself off as a medical source or anything. I just speak to my experience. More often than not, people reach out to me with questions or lend me support. It’s isolating enough having this illness, and I’m grateful for the support. People will surprise you—with the worst but more often with the best. Most of us are just trying to live here on this earth and help each other during the journey, especially now. 

Since I was rediagnosed with schizoaffective last summer, not much has changed about my approach. Certainly people are less familiar with SZA than bipolar. But now at least among my friends they actually know someone who has it and maybe a thing or two about the illness. That’s a win, in my book.

I will say though that for many years I did not feel safe being open about my mental illness. Owning it was liberating, but I did it only when I felt comfortable and secure the fallout wouldn’t be worse than keeping it a secret.

Eventually I adjusted and still take it roughly every other day (I have to make the prescription stretch, too). 

I do think it helps with the TD symptoms if taken regularly. I have trouble keeping track of when I take it, but when I do I notice fewer TD symptoms. I would like to take it more frequently and might need to at 80 mg if my TD gets worse.

Other side effects...it makes me very tired, so I take it at night before bed. I will not drive if I have taken it within the last few hours. I tried that once and almost crashed my car.

Plus towards the end, I was diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia, which is disabling in its own way.

I'm my own worst judge and don't give myself enough credit/recognition for anything. I'm working on it, though, and having my family and friends there to help means a lot.

It's hard, especially when I'm hypomanic or manic and think I can do anything. Then I come crashing down to earth.

Please be extra kind to yourself right now.

The first time I noticed it was a weird sensation like my jaw was clenching and moving around on its own, making my teeth touch slightly. Then I noticed I was getting this tense feeling in my tongue. Even though it wasn't sticking out like some people get with TD, it felt like a pressure to move around. And then I noticed that I was getting squinting in my brow. My eyebrows would draw together in a twitching movement. Part of the AIMS test is they make you do some minor arbitrary movement that requires your concentration, and then they observe if you have any TD-like movements going on without you noticing it because you're focusing on the task. That's how I noticed the squinting thing... I go to the movies a lot, and it was when I was otherwise just watching a movie staring straight ahead that the involuntary movement became apparent. Normally we're in such constant motion it's not always easy to see what's happening of its own free will. I will say that it is true that sometimes these meds cause TD-like symptoms, but it's not actually TD, it's just a reaction to that specific med that might go away if you stop taking it. Latuda can do that. Also, TD can go away, too. It is not always permanent. I can't give you medical advice, but honestly I think it's worth going to see another pdoc now, if only because they could do an AIMS test and rule it out and put your mind to rest. You might not have it. What you're experiencing could be something else (look into ""akathsia"" which has some similar symptoms). Then you can go back to your pdoc in April if you want."

For me, I had a bipolar I diagnosis for years, but I started to develop psychosis even when I wasn't having a mood episode. I was still having psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) in between episodes.

Also, another distinguishing feature are the so-called ""negative"" symptoms of schizophrenia that you get with schizoaffective. They can look an awful lot like depression, but they aren't quite the same. For example, during a psychosis episode, I had an extremely flat/blunted affect, couldn't really move or speak, etc. It was different from a depressive episode.

Last, one way that my pdoc and I figured it out was by bumping up my antipsychotic to a schizophrenia level. I had been at a bipolar level of Seroquel (400 mg). When we went up to 600 mg and then 800 mg, the psychosis almost disappeared. Therefore, we concluded, since the psychosis went away when I was taking a heavier dose more common to schizoaffective/schizophrenia, I was having psychosis at that level."

schizoaffective,fcwaem1,t3_ej83ce,1578020843.0,"I last worked full time in 2014, then worked as a freelancer until 2018. My illness had always required a lot of appointments, but in early 2018 treatment got much more involved and time consuming. I was in intensive outpatient for four months, then went inpatient. There was no way to do that with a full time job, and I could only manage it because freelance life was flexible. Same thing this year: I was hospitalized in the summer, then did three months of IOP again. With regular therapy/pdoc appointments, not to mention waiting at pharmacies, phone calls to my insurance, getting blood work for lithium levels, going to specialists for related conditions/side effects, etc....all the extra stuff to manage my illness....trying to stay healthy became my job.

All the time, my illness made it impossible to hold down a gig without symptoms flaring up triggering an episode.

Finally I applied for SSDI (social security disability) in June of 2019. I was lucky enough to get it awarded on the first try in November.

Here’s the thing: in my award letter, SSA said I had become eligible under their rules in October 2015. I wish I had applied then and not put myself through four more years of work-related stress. But I was ashamed and felt like being disabled was a failure (I come from a high-achieving abled family) or made me useless to society. (I think a very American attitude.)

Now? I’m trying to rest and refocus. My symptoms and especially suicidal ideation/behavior have become really serious these last few years. It’s true: this illness can be life threatening and dangerous. I’m just trying to survive it. 

I kept the door open at a few gigs because you can be on disability and still work—it’s not one or the other. You can craft a future of your own and find a way to live in harmony with your illness. I’m not there yet, but I believe one day I might get there.

You’re already doing a great job identifying what you need and sticking with treatment. Remember, your life and wellness are worth more than a job or work. I feel like this is an especially unhealthy attitude common in my country (USA). But this is the truth: there will always be job opportunities waiting and ready for when/if you want to go back.

schizoaffective,f9qnucb,t3_e6fk3v,1575564209.0,"I've definitely met the full criteria for OCD, sometimes more than others. I was just talking about this with my pdoc yesterday...I've been on so many psych meds for so long, that even though I'm primarily being treated for schizoaffective and bipolar, that med regime is probably treating/masking other underlying symptoms and disorders and, mostly, keeping it at bay. Like my borderline issues I'm sure are being calmed by my meds... if only because they sedate my brain so much, it's hard for borderline stuff to break through.

Also, I totally think my SZA psychosis feeds into the OCD traits and vice versa. A big recurring paranoid delusion I have is a fear of contamination. When I'm having that, the OCD creeps out of the shadows and feeds it... I start developing excessive rituals and routines to overcome the irrational contamination fears magnified by my psychosis.

For example, recently I had olfactory hallucinations that I was smelling pesticides lasting three days. I became convinced that our next door neighbors had done a mosquito spray treatment and that it had seeped into my office (a converted sunroom) and was poisoning my cats and infecting my books in the room. I wouldn't go into the room, and when I did, I had a choking attack and felt like I could literally feel the poison in my body and bones. I became very irritable, panic attacks, crying spells, etc, trying to do OCD rituals to cleanse myself excessively, seal off the door, etc. I asked my Mom to ask the neighbors if they had done a treatment like that. Of course it didn't! It was late fall and too cold, and they would have given us a head's up.

That's just one of the many times the OCD and SZA have overlapped."

I know my pdoc won’t be happy, but I never go rogue like that. I was so desperate. And it seemed like the least destructive of the options I was considering (take none of it, flush it down the toilet, or take all of it at once). 

However, I did get very, very good news this week that I was approved for SSDI on the first try, and it’ll kick in next month. I’m trying to focus on that. It’s no small miracle.

A frequent symptom of my psychosis is feeling like the context chip has been taken out of my brain. I'll see friends, family, even my cats, and not recognize them as people/cats I know. It's like the context has been taken out. Not only do I not know who they are, but I don't know *what* they are, or who I am, or anything.

I guess neither of these are quite what you mean with an actual explosion, but they also make me feel like there's nothing at all inside my scull. It feels like my brain's exploded, but I'm missing the actual explosion you describe."

Journaling,f4cfemm,t3_dk5c32,1571528368.0,"I used to journal exclusively with Moleskines for more than 15 years.

It’s more like the dimensions of a book, which is attractive to me as a writer who aspires to write books.

As stated, the paper quality is awesome (it never bleeds for me), and the whole construction is very sturdy. Can’t beat having two ribbons! I like that the pages are paginated, too.

The best endorsement I can give it is this: all those years, all those Moleskines were never filled...I never knew why. Something just didn’t click, And now I’m about 19 pages away from filling up my first Leuchtturm, which will be the first journal I’ll have completed ever."
schizoaffective,f3w5gnl,t3_d5qeez,1571192478.0,"Once, my old pdoc was convinced that I'd overfilled my benzo. I knew I had not, but given that I'd been having strong suicidal ideation a few weeks before, they were convinced I was lying and ""stockpiling"" meds to do the act. My therapist knew I wasn't suicidal, but told me to go to the hospital and get an emergency psych eval, that they would clear me to go home and my pdoc would be satisfied. As it turns out, I was allowed to go, but right at the end, my pdoc called in an involuntary, so I signed myself in.

I told myself, get your story straight, and tell the same story over and over, never let them see you cry, and never let them see it is getting to you. Don't vent about your pdoc, just say it's been a misunderstanding. I used to be in theatre when I was younger, so I thought I'd just lean on those skills.

The hospital double checked with my pharmacy, and lo and behold, it *was* a clerical error -  they'd accidentally marked that I had filled the Rx. Yes, that's right, the mentally ill patient had been telling the truth, go figure.

But man, that was brutal. I was in there over the weekend when they didn't do discharges, so I had to play along for a few days. When I was released, the experience had given me quite a lot of trauma. You see, at some point, it started to get to me, that maybe I *had* filled the medication. Maybe I *was* suicidal, like everyone says I was. Made me question my judgment and doubt reality. I had to trust myself, but it was so hard.

The whole thing was very ""Kafkaesque.""

In August my diagnosis switched from Bipolar I (the diagnosis I had for 13 years) to Schizoaffective Bipolar Type. Since then my pdoc has upped my Seroquel XR to 800 mg. I also started Ingrezza for tardive dyskinesia.

I am having a real hard time this weekend. I don’t feel like my delusions and hallucinations are going away. I’ve never felt lonelier in my life—my delusions are screwing with my mind right now. They tell me I’m the only one who is alive, that I’m a being from another planet, and people from my planet are coming to get me. I don’t think I can trust my pdoc anymore. He knows too much. I’m not even sure he’s real. Everything is crumbling, and I don’t think I’m past the self harm psychosis thoughts.

But this is the tricky thing - My application was originally for bipolar I (and borderline). Over the summer, my doctor and I realized that I actually have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type along with the borderline, and now I have developed tardive dyskenisia after years on antipsychotics, so we are treating that, too. 

Also, I was hospitalized for a week in July during the SSDI application process and have been in intensive outpatient since early August.
