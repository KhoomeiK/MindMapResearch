I don’t know your story, I don’t know what’s lead you to this point but if you can, instead of saying to yourself “Today will be better”, just say “Today will be what it is.”  If you can and it’s something you’re able to do, try going to the doctor.  If you can go to the doctor, set that expectation today.  If you can’t go to the doctor, set a small expectation on yourself, like “Today I will think one kind thing about myself” or better yet, no expectations at all.  Setting the expectation that Today will be better is just setting you up for failure.  And I know it’s easier said then done but, try not to set expectations.

But all the love in the world doesn’t change the fact she needs to ask permission.  Like what everyone said, tell her no because you weren’t asked and going forward your going to need to be consulted if she wants to do things like that.  Also, if she wants to spend time with LO then it has to be when your ex has her, it’s unfair for you to be expected to give up your time.  That’s not unreasonable.  I hope the best for you."

depression,ept7gs5,t3_bvup45,1559483690.0,"Yup, I should be happy and fulfilled.  I have a lot going on in my life that is great but it’s never enough.  And not in a “I need more” way, it’s like why can’t I just be content for a moment?  Why can’t that feeling of apathy and emptiness just go away for a second?  It’s like that carnival game where you test your strength by hitting a lever with a hammer to get a puck to hit a bell.  I’m hitting that lever but the puck never hits the bell no matter how hard I hit it."
JUSTNOMIL,epr5ay8,t3_bvkb8q,1559418573.0,"It sounds like she’s implying your pregnant already.  She’s commented you’ve gained weight since the wedding and should have joint baby showers with an already pregnant relative.  Next time I’d be blunt with her, “I’m not pregnant but we will let you know when I am some time in the future maybe.”"
funny,epn8afn,t3_bv7fpy,1559323232.0,That look screams “I hate your friends.”
JUSTNOMIL,epn7lgu,t3_bv77nt,1559322886.0,"So the first part of her message was definitely an apology.  The second part completely negated it.  “I’m sorry but...” is not an apology.  If she had stopped at that first part I would have said, I think you should give her a chance (supervised with boundaries) but she tried justifying her actions and when that happens they’re not sorry.  It appears because of some drama with your SIL, she felt it gave her free reign to be an asshole.  And still feels that way.  In her mind, she’s apologized and you guys are square and when you say no about seeing her she will use this as an example to DH about how unreasonable you’re being.  Show DH how this isn’t an apology before replying to her and explain that her justifying why she did something isn’t an apology."
