LushCosmetics,floeg1p,t3_fbqedl,1585336723.0,Yikes after reading all of this recent shit about how Lush went about laying off employees it looks like I dodged a bullet. For everyone effected: I’m so sorry you’re all dealing with this

If someone is new to lush they are usually the people who will start asking questions the moment they walk in, and almost every time I’ve spoken to these customers they left with something."

Yeah, one thing they told us to do was just grab a basket and give it to customers who didn’t already have one. I usually just asked, but was also told that was the “wrong” thing to do, bc it gave the customer the option to say no"
LushCosmetics,fjp1m95,t1_fjdhkz3,1583539638.0,"That’s basically what happened to me towards the end. I got a new job around the same time as a co worker, and they started getting even more shitty than usual. They cut our hours down to 1 shift a week. One week we didn’t have any. My coworker was a floor leader who stepped down to be a regular SA and basically got bullied out by the other FL’s and Manager.

Ain’t nothing remotely ethical about a company that straight up uses and abuses their employees. Being in that store was like being in an abusive relationship. Full fucking stop. Not to mention the majority of their moisturizers that are actual halfway decent are $40. FORTY.

I love queen bee but I know the prices are about to increased on that too.

About the shipping? They literally have NO excuse. They don’t even try to make up a reason for charging shipping. And all the bs about ethically sourcing ingredients is still sketchy to me. In the UK? Maybe at best, but the way corporations in America are ran? I genuinely don’t believe it. Bc if that were the case, then why are UK products so different than they are here? The scrubee is a great example: in the Im scrubee is thicker, has tons of butters and has that natural yellow color that cocoa butter is supposed to have. The quality is vastly different, as well as their prices.

I believe the green washing, fake ass ethics and the lack of consistency all around are going to kill this company. But 🤷🏽‍♂️"

YIKES!"
LushCosmetics,fj8qcmj,t1_fj8ppwb,1583119538.0,"Yeah, they definitely should. After they got called out about not donating to the Australian brush fires, that really started really bringing my suspicions and feelings to light. And no employee should ever be put in that position AT ALL. The protests? I get it to a degree. Sending sums of dollars would be better. These exclusive products? No. Even charity pot I have some questions about bc I know they have over 1200 different organizations that the money goes toward and breaking down the amount of dollars per organization I’m still not sure how much every organization actually gets. I feel like if they dedicated each month to a specific organization or even a specific topic that would be even better."
LushCosmetics,fj8pb3q,t1_fj8os5c,1583118799.0,"No problem I was kind of confused for a minute 😂 but yeah, employees are not being paid to be put in uncomfortable positions. I’m going to be doing advocacy work “on the ground” but I’m trained to discuss with strangers and Lush isn’t preparing their employees for all of that stress. However, I can respond in a way I feel fit if it goes bad as well as have sople who are going to protect me/have my back if anything.

With what you already told me, this shit can get dangerous. I remember during our meeting about this campaign we were told if someone said something hateful or racist that we still needed to “be respectful” and still treat them like any other customer.

Like, absolutely not lol"

LushCosmetics,fj8oh3m,t1_fj8o0fp,1583118212.0,"Well.... I don’t think that’s divisive. I think their desire to use this sort of campaign that’s essentially JUST for profit, to get people talking about them is gross. Again it feels disingenuous.

And as a child of an immigrant it’s insulting. I don’t think discussing these issues are divisive at all, but doing it under the pretense of “bringing awareness” when it’s all just for an image is gross.

However, I do understand people not being comfortable talking about this. I feel like it can put employees in risky situations with aggressive or hateful people. I also feel like it can create tension that employees aren’t paid for, and employees are already under pressure. I also feel that if Lush cared so much about immigrants they wouldn’t need to do all of these campaigns or create products for these campaigns. If they genuinely cared, then why not send money directly? There’s so many ways to go about supporting or advocating that doesn’t involve making an exclusive product"

LushCosmetics,fj7f3xe,t1_fj7eukm,1583090807.0,I don’t even know if the company still stands for what they say they stand for anymore. If it doesn’t reflect on their employees than that leaves me thinking that it’s a total farce

LushCosmetics,fj6zog7,t1_fj6xuq5,1583083452.0,Here’s another thing: the floor leaders at my store were also being micromanaged. The store isn’t doing well and my managers only concern is his ability to move up in the company. Lol
LushCosmetics,fj6zj5i,t1_fj6ywjn,1583083368.0,Tbh that’s how I thought working there would be. That customers would be left alone and they we didn’t have to force sales

LushCosmetics,fj6y57v,t1_fj6k4ee,1583082598.0,Ugh and here I thought it would be better elsewhere. I’m so sorry. This company just keeps getting more and more disappointing
LushCosmetics,fj6y1cj,t1_fj6o2tz,1583082537.0,I’m so sorry :( I know there are a lot of us. I’d really like all of us with these experiences to come together in someway and air it out.
LushCosmetics,fj6xxm2,t1_fj6u8qq,1583082480.0,I don’t blame you one bit. If I ever walked into a store and someone did that I would be disgusted. When my manager told me that I “need” to do that and asked me how I would feel as a new customer walking in there I told him I wouldn’t feel okay with it 😂
LushCosmetics,fj6xr27,t1_fj6xfn3,1583082382.0,"Omg no no nooo.

If I had to deal with a racist customer I would’ve popped off. I can’t believe they told you that but I’m absolutely not surprised. A manager should be protecting their employees!!"
LushCosmetics,fj6xkz7,t1_fj6uh9s,1583082287.0,"It’s funny how that is. It’s a retail job that’s more stressful than many serious jobs that can be stressful.

I work at a college now, and my job is working for disadvantaged students to help them get into college. A lot of their stories can be distressing but in a whole different way. As much as Lush says they want to benefit the world and be “advocates” they do very little of that. As someone who literally works as an advocate, I don’t see how lush could claim it at all."
LushCosmetics,fj6x82o,t1_fj6vpdw,1583082077.0,"Omg wowwwww! That’s nuts but I can relate on my manager making me cry lmao that was within the first two months. After that I would cry in my car on the way home. But I stayed bc I hope it would get better after that manager left (she was going on maternity leave) it got a little better but that’s not saying much.

I’m really glad you left too. We deserve so much better"
LushCosmetics,fj6x0mz,t1_fj6vz1k,1583081955.0,That’s so sad tbh. It’s RETAIL. It shouldn’t be this stressful

LushCosmetics,fj6wom9,t1_fj6t97a,1583081758.0,"Yeahh I heard yesterday about that 6% “bonus” on top of my manager telling me I HAD to share the stores Facebook posts 😂 I really tried to do exactly what you were saying about going against those aggressive sales but my manager watched me constantly while I was working, and just about every hour told me what I was doing wrong. I made so many sales yesterday and this treatment was exactly what I got. I was also told I wasn’t bringing the customers to demo the “right way” So much micromanaging and I didn’t want to deal with it anymore. Manipulating people to buy shit they don’t want or can’t afford isn’t the way I do things. It’s 100% unethical"
LushCosmetics,fj6wfgj,t1_fj6kdai,1583081617.0,You’re absolutely correct. The products do sell themselves and quite quickly. New releases like super milk are testimony to that. But they want the customer to buy MORE. It’s ridiculous. I’m glad you never had that experience though.
LushCosmetics,fj6w7iz,t1_fj6o2m6,1583081485.0,"👏🏽 for real though. I genuinely believe all of their progressive “campaigns” are just another way to boost sales. It’s totally disingenuous and I don’t if anyone says I’m lying bc I’ve seen it in action lol.

If any company claims to be so ethical and progressive then why are their base level employees paid only $10/hr without benefits? If they really were progressive EVERY employee would be getting benefits, every employee would be making livable wage, mandatory vacations, longer breaks, and more. But they don’t. They just care about the company image and money"
LushCosmetics,fj6vvp9,t1_fj6ep8p,1583081285.0,"When you go in next, just be honest straight up “hey I know it’s your job to help me, and I know your job is sale focused, but please just let me shop. And let your boss know what I said if there’s any problem” 

I feel like if customers kept doing that in store than maybe this type of sales tactics employed by the company will stop or at least calm down"
LushCosmetics,fj6vl5x,t1_fj6bct4,1583081107.0,I’m really sorry that happened to you. I know how jarring and inappropriate that can be. Just know that a lot of us don’t like to be touch or touch other people without their consent. I’m a huge advocate for consent which is why I’ve never been alright with this tactic
LushCosmetics,fj6va8o,t1_fj6dmzg,1583080931.0,"Also, they’re not listening bc that doesn’t fall in with their bottom line which is money"
LushCosmetics,fj6v754,t1_fj6dmzg,1583080877.0,"I relate to this entirely as someone who’s also autistic and has social anxiety. I know it sounds crazy bc I was working there though 😩😂 trust me, it was. But if my managers weren’t an issue for me and Lush was as ethical as they claim I would’ve enjoyed it bc I’m really good at picking up on product information as well as what’s in the products literally just based on my nose. I was awkward as hell as an SA but for some reason a lot of customers really liked me. I think it’s probably the fact that despite being awkward we can also be pretty endearing and empathetic, and people really take notice things like that.

Now though? I think I’m the future I’ll just pop into the small shops where it’s much more tame or just stick with online, but I really don’t know if I’m going to be shopping there for a while"
LushCosmetics,fj6tcef,t1_fj6svdw,1583079727.0,"I’m so happy you enjoy it and work in that environment, for real! Everyone deserves to walk into work feeling that way.

Some folks are really good at it, but tbh I don’t trust those folks 😂 the basket pushing was just gross and completely inappropriate in my opinion. All of the sales tactics are beyond aggressive and even more, the treatment of employees.

I feel like I’m North America sales in lush have steadily gotten more aggressive, AND at the same time the prices of product have also been increasing. It’s definitely veered way off their original ideas, and it’s really showing in many areas.

I don’t really see a reason for these changes except for purely making more money/greed. Shipping was also not nearly as bad as it has become!"
