A good video about the metaphysics of Pepe was done by Johnathan Pageau and Jordan Peterson awhile ago that covers why Pepe is frightening. Johnathan's take was that Pepe is both silly (I don't need to explain why this is) but also frightening because of how the frog is used and what it represents. Pepe is a kind of blank slate that we project onto rather than be a defined symbol himself. So when 4chan projected hate symbols through Pepe it wasn't that Pepe became a hate symbol, it was that he was a way for people to project hate through him, and when people are able to do that it is hard to stop them. You can yell at them all you want and tell them to stop and ""don't they know the damage they are doing?!?!?"" But through Pepe, they are able to look back at them and say, yes, what I am doing are the things you despise and there is nothing you can do about it.

This is all possible through the metaphysics of the frog and I know my answer isn't the best but the video is way better at explaining this.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixc9i1G7eew&t=463s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixc9i1G7eew&t=463s)  Pepe is kind of like a clown symbol in this way."

Because western religion has very big apocalypse themes in it. A linear cosmology has to have a conclusion of course, so many people speculate about the end times and even act on it. Christianity was originally one such end-times cult. As for why conspiracy attracts religion is a lot of the grand conspiracies tie into these religious ideas. I think conspiracy theorists see religion as system of control. The religious side would be to say what is controlling you if not for a system of religion?"
