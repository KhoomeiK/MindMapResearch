offmychest,fnbn3vd,t1_fn8wvch,1586818493.0,"hey friend. i left this message to respond to last for a couple reasons. i read it last night, and i’ve been thinking about it all day.  
i am so grateful you decided to comment this. from the bottom of my heart. it seriously moved me to tears.  
i am so deeply sorry for your loss. i cant imagine how painful that feels. i’m sure your brother was an absolute gem of a person, and i sincerely believe he’s at peace wherever he is.  
again, thank you for your message. it honestly means the world to me. i am so so touched. i’ll be thinking of you with every small triumph my friend. you deserve the world. i’m proud of you for being here, and thank you for your unconditional support to me, and people in a similar position. you make the world a better place, and i hope you know that!! thank you <3"
offmychest,fnbmj2y,t1_fna1vwk,1586818194.0,"this made me cry! thank you so so so much for your advice, and your kind words. you deserve the world. i’ll be thinking of you and your advice for days to come!! again, thank you!"
offmychest,fnbmajp,t1_fn8u0v5,1586818072.0,"thank you so so much!! my favourite tips to share would be to keep track of your usage, triggers and symptoms as you start to come off of them. what really helped me push through the first few days was distractions, and methods of delay. filling my days up with activities that took my mind off of it. even shit as stupid as bleaching my hair or curling it, or reorganising my kitchen cabinets. watching loads of movie to past the time was also really helpful. it’s a slow and agonising process, especially at first, so it’s okay to allow yourself to feel the shitty and treat yourself to low energy activities.  
as for methods of delay, when i feel like relapsing, i tell myself to wait 5 minutes, then 15, and so on, until i either forget, find a distraction, or normally fall asleep. or i’ll put on a movie and say “i won’t take it now, but i’ll watch this movie and then decide if i want to do it when it’s finished” and by the end of it usually i managed to curb the urge.  
exercising when you feel the urge over the course of the day was super super helpful too, particularly stuff focused on core strength. it would give me a nice buzz and by the end of it i’d feel so worn out that the idea of taking stuff would make me feel a bit sick. it’s also nice to see yourself build up more toned features over the course of even a few days of intense exercise. adrenaline filled activities are good.  
i use melatonin to help with the insomnia, it’s been particularly bad recently (haven’t slept in literally 3 days) but it’s comforting to know i have it as a safety net just in case the insomnia is really bad.  
the app “i am sober” has really helped me to keep track of my usage, and my withdrawal symptoms. you can log positive and negative symptoms as you reach each milestone (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month etc). it also sends positive notifications! couldn’t recommend it enough. seeing how many days i’ve been sober for pushes me to hang on for at least another day.  
you got this friend. i believe in you. i’m so proud of you for being here. you’re more than welcome to pm me if you wanna talk. i got you!"
