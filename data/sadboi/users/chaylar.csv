They also had more time in the game. Though they seemed to only really orbit back around to eachother instead of being paired up right away.

If it was furiosa perusing max(leaving out that max did not persue her, and all the narrative reasons why she wouldn't)she'd appear desperate and weaker. If furiosa was male(mr. Furious?) Thered be no expectation that he and max would be attracted to eachother and the movie would probably eshue romance all together(but oh my god a gay romance in a mad max movie, I'd watch that. Though theres probably some cheesy fan fiction out there already) and would opt for the survival friends route.


Personally I dont think mad max, the pinnacle of postapocalyptic survival driven violence in movies is really the right place for romance. Atleast not for Max himself. 


But if there was a romance in a mad max setting I don't think that it would be very well developed over the very short course of the fury road story line. How long was it 2 days? 3? Not a lot of time to develop feelings beyond necessary trust and mutual respect."
MadMax,fqja4oz,t1_fqivc4r,1589407116.0,"We can respectfully disagree.


I think the problem I have is that ""romance"" in movies is just so shallow. Boy meets girl. They adventure for like 2 days. Then get together, big passionate kiss. Happily ever after. It's just done over and over and over. Its expected. And having it be expected reduces the female character imo. 


I'm not anti romance. I'm pro diversity. I'm happy that this one didn't go that way. I'm happy that furiosa is a person not a cardboard cutout for the boy to hook up with(not that max is over his wife or anything anyway). 


I like a good romantic relationship in a movie I just like it to be more developed."
