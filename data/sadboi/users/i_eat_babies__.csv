bioengineering,fmqe3gk,t3_fwrxxv,1586297878.0,"BMET associates will more than likely not help with a BME degree. I have a BE BME and have worked as a BMET. Although both jobs require different types of skill and the ideas in theory intertwine; the degrees are ultimately unrelated. For my BE, I took classes such as thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, advanced cell and tissue, advanced bone, so forth. Although I did take classes like Calc, Differentials, and Physics (all covered in BS BMET courses I’ve seen) the inverse is not true. My coworkers haven’t taken thermo/fluids/etc. 


Best bet, just stay on Gen Math and more advanced physics classes, as they will evolve into the courses you’ll take take later on (BME-centric). As much as I can shit on thermodynamics because the body is mostly an adiabatic system (really, off of my hate for thermo); the sciences build upon each other — something you’ve seen in your BA Biology for sure. Good luck!"

AskEngineers,fmd2ntr,t3_ftojyg,1585957979.0,"I second the research position route, kind of. Honestly, just shoot for everything and see what sticks. If someone throws you a bone just yeet it.


What I did was, through a research position I held in my school, was able to leverage that into getting a permanent position a vascular dynamics lab. I also leveraged the title of my degree (at the time, in progress) to become a field technician (biomedical equipment technician). Although it had NOTHING to do with what I learned at school, I just wanted to see how it was. Ultimately by the time I graduated with a Bachelors of Engineering, I was able to use the experience I had as a technician with an ABET B.E. to land an Engineering Specialist Job. My job as is, requires me to work with my hands but also engineer novel solutions to certain problems. 75% tech work, 25% engineering work. 

I personally feel that a bachelors of engineering in bioengineering is such a wildcard. I ended up being able to mold it into something that I don't necessarily *love*, but something that I definitely don't hate. 


I can't say much for most of my peers. Most aren't doing so great, although some are content in Masters and PhD Programs, and have found relief through that. If you find something you love in biomedical engineering specifically, try to see if you can do an MS-PhD or at the very least an MS. I am located in the NYC area if that helps, good luck with your journey!"

BMET,flvw10n,t1_flvlw6p,1585533443.0,"In terms of chemical cleaning, same precaution. Personally in my hospital, no higher cleaning agents than the orange sani-wipes are easily accessible. But also, something as low as 60%+ isopropyl alcohol kills coronavirus [(source)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/hcp-hand-sanitizer.html). 


In terms of awareness, understand that this is the device that connects to what intubates. Therefore, the chance of it having COVID19 on it's body surface is much higher. Try to be in a well ventilated area, but definitely take extra care and **precision** in handling the ventilator. There's no greater action that can be taken than precision in your actions when handling the ventilator (assuming it's already been cleaned well, of course). Gloves only, make sure anything those gloves touch are discarded or cleaned appropriately."
BMET,flvl7b6,t3_freuuc,1585526252.0,"On a precursory side note: Have clear cut plans between bio-med Management and Sterile Processing. I have been in numerous bio-med situations (first party, OEM, third party, etc.) and throughout my time in bio-med, this is what I see lacking. A clear cut relationship between Biomedical Engineering departments and CS Departments. Although basic, these questions are important: *""who's washing what?""*, *""when/after how long is an item good for pickup/to be worked on?""*. 


But to answer your question, properly sanitized devices pose no risk to having COVID19. Devices cleaned with 60% isopropyl alcohol or above, on all crevices, and being handled after the cleaning agent drying time. This is important because it poses the question: how do we really know something is properly sanitized after patient use?

I would treat all devices coming in as having COVID19 surface contaminants. Wear a mask when dealing with equipment, keep a sani-cloth between your work table/desk and the device, wear gloves at all times. Although this would definitely show down productivity, your health is irreplaceable. 


I personally have been abusing the orange (bleach, 4%) sani-wipes on devices. Although it's not the best for LCD screens or the housing of certain plastics (lets say, pumps) and metals (lets say, GE Dash series); it still satisfies my requirement for cleaning (<60% iso-alcohol). Afterwards, I will still treat it as a contaminated item and approach it cautiously, as aforementioned.

Hope this helped!"

All jokes aside, manhattan NY in-house here. It’s getting stressful. We’re hearing news of clinicians in Mount Sinai (Manhattan) passing away due to lack of PPE (a male nurse in his 40’s with Asthma, I believe). Clinicians are overloaded with work, so is biomed. The other day I had to just convert what was a non-patient area into beds with GE-MUSE DASH monitors. Hundreds of incoming inspections on Kangaroo Feeding Pumps, Aspirators; the hospital I work at is really preparing (which is something I definitely praise them for). But there’s a lot of dread in the air given the situation, it’s making it hard for me to want to emotionally return to work. Thankfully good co-workers and management help.

If you can, during your senior year, take Dynamics or Advanced Mechatronics (should be ME 599 with Jack Chu). If you do happen to take Dynamics next semester, take ME 411 with Elvin right after.


BME curricula does not cover FEA by default, and leaving CCNY with more advanced MechE skills is a great boost (to get you out of the rut of feeling like a lab monkey). I definitely feel more confident in applying for general engineering jobs, given the skill from those classes. 


Also, avoid working with Carriero for Senior Design. She's great if you're only taking Senior Design and have no other things to do in life (Internship, Work, etc). Otherwise, I would highly recommend you avoid the headache. If you need anything, pm. GL."
