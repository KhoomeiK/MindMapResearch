pestcontrol,fdt8jof,t3_en23m4,1578713327.0,"Also I know the dead bug in the photo is not a roach.

Okay so I live in an apartment that's half underground (basement) and moved in August. I started seeing bugs in my bathroom pretty soon, and I really freaked out one night when one fell onto my hand from the ceiling. Recently, around November, I was about to go into my bathroom when I saw a huge cockroach inside the door frame. A few weeks later I saw a baby cockroach running around outside my bathroom. I left for the entire month December, and my landlord said they did pest control while I was away. Now, I've been noticing these super tiny black/dark brown dots on the floor, as well as brown smears, when I wake up in the morning. Are those tiny dots dead baby roaches? What about the smears? I haven't seen any roaches (only other bugs) since I've been back, but I'm so terrified because it's a studio apartment, so I don't know how to escape them. I don't even use my bathroom anymore.

Edit: I also vaccum and clean my counters often. I don't leave dishes in my sink overnight. I don't leave food out. I don't know what to do, but I feel like I can't stay in my own apartment. I only use my kitchen sink now to brush my teeth, wash my face, etc. I'm so terrified of my bathroom."
