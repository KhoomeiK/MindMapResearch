ShaneDawson,f50nuz9,t3_dman3l,1571930242.0,just watched this one for the first time the other day. i think i only noticed it because i saw it after everything came out! nice catch though :)
ShaneDawson,f3cyzsb,t1_f3c93a2,1570829879.0,thanks!
ShaneDawson,f3cyxpx,t1_f3cupoe,1570829860.0,thank you!
ShaneDawson,f3bm41u,t3_dfos05,1570812951.0,does anyone know the posting schedule? possibly in EST time?
ShaneDawson,f2n4kaj,t3_ddhh35,1570312158.0,made my boyfriend watch the first episode with me for my second time through. he was very confused
Depersonalization,ezwemab,t1_ezw21d2,1568214885.0,i know exactly what you mean and i used it too to feel something and “break the barrier” in a way. i haven’t done that either in a while and in general i’m about 230 days free of self harm so i’m just trying to push through.
Depersonalization,ezvlgn5,t3_d2fu29,1568183275.0,"in regards to trying self harm to help (if i read that correctly) - i used to cut myself a lot, a little before my DPD started. once that started, i stopped cutting but did use self harm a while after THAT to try and “snap myself out” of the feeling of DPD. basically i thought that if i felt all this pain just like i did before DPD started, i could just snap back to the old times and trick my brain in a way. very complicated but i know what you mean and i feel for you."
Depersonalization,ezvl8zx,t1_ezuvtjz,1568182988.0,i totally agree! i loved lexapro for a good amount of time i was on it. i had to stop after a while because i felt a little of the “zombie” feelings come on and also i just didn’t feel comfortable taking that much medicine (my anxiety is to blame on that one). but yes totally crazy how everyone’s brain is different and reacts to different things!
HIMYM,ey7dugv,t1_ey64hj6,1566879594.0,"i just saw this episode the other day for the first time in a while! after rewatching it at least 5 times before, this was the first time i noticed!"
Anxiety,ey7bbdx,t3_cvxeqr,1566877217.0,do not be ashamed! i know exactly how you feel. i’ve gotten so bad that i have to ask my friends and family to check if i look weird or off due to a possible stroke or other health issue. and i’m only 20. it stinks but that is really what anxiety is. i feel your pain and i doubt anyone was upset or angry at you! sometimes we just get so in our heads that we can’t see clearly.
selfharm,ey54dd9,t1_ey4zoxy,1566821377.0,thank you ❤️
selfharm,ey4e1i9,t1_ey3buru,1566789312.0,really needed to hear this tonight. thank you
MadeOfStyrofoam,ey4aut0,t3_cvebps,1566786621.0,ill be 21 in a few months. i’m glad i’m not alone!
UnsentLetters,ey45a5l,t3_cvfmsw,1566782192.0,i just told my boyfriend i loved him for the first time two days ago. totally worth it even though i was so nervous before hand. best of luck to you:)
HIMYM,exl3qjl,t3_cti564,1566405308.0,love it
howimetyourmother,ew04sds,t1_evzj7gd,1564975785.0,wow this got me in my feels. LOVE this quote.
howimetyourmother,evsglbu,t1_evs2uy4,1564745551.0,thank you!
howimetyourmother,evruoci,t3_ckurt0,1564719065.0,hello where do i get this??? i’ve never seen or even heard of it!
dpdr,evrtyb6,t3_ckpg4e,1564718427.0,that three minute quiz - this is WAY too accurate.
questions,evi9h0u,t3_cjx076,1564539086.0,my boyfriend does. totally normal!
MadeOfStyrofoam,ev7qsue,t3_cii422,1564263139.0,BRUH. i remember doing it the first time and was like “ow that hurt i’m not doing that again”.  ha @ me 5 years later.
Depersonalization,ev0npi2,t1_euzkzqr,1564142842.0,"it used to be way worse when my dpdr was way worse. so that’s why i think mines anxiety. i mean yes, i think you can get contact high but you would have to be in a very enclosed and small place with the person exhaling right next to you. i don’t think you have to necessarily *feel* anxious for dpdr to *kick in* more. idk i’m also not a doctor and i think i’m just traumatized from weed in general and still am trying to fix myself, but hopefully you’ll feel more comfortable around your friends when they smoke soon!"
MadeOfStyrofoam,euz79ll,t1_eut53jk,1564114494.0,i’m dying half my head purple tomorrow out of pure impulse!!
MadeOfStyrofoam,euz3ncv,t1_euz3fo0,1564112763.0,damn ghats crazy. that’s good though! no problem!! :)
MadeOfStyrofoam,euz2kk8,t3_chx62r,1564112257.0,"wait that hot dog guy is from TWO YEARS ago?? am i going crazy , i thought it just came out like 6 months ago. sorry, hope you’re doing better!"
Depersonalization,euy89xn,t3_chu940,1564096891.0,sometimes i think it happens to me but then again it could just be my anxiety making me feel high and extra out of it
Anxiety,eu2ob5q,t3_ced3nz,1563394508.0,wow that’s awesome :) one day i’ll make it to driving on the highway!! so proud of you!
dpdr,etvgnmm,t3_cdfv1w,1563234904.0,this sounds like a really cool idea :) i can probably contribute personal experiences! i’m not very good at poetry or art
dpdr,etvg3r1,t3_cd2wif,1563234494.0,"i honestly could have written this word for word. i feel your frustration. you’re definitely not alone about this. that is something i’m still trying to accept - that no one who doesn’t experience this, no matter how much you tell them, could ever understand."
dpdr,etvfs57,t1_etv06r5,1563234251.0,it was definitely worse for me when i was in high school but college lectures are still frustrating! usually my courses post the lectures online so when i need to i can go back and re read powerpoints!
dpdr,ett5w7b,t3_cd955v,1563165650.0,this happens to me a lot during school lectures. i zone out and don’t even notice and then all of a sudden i miss half a lecture. very frustrating!!
Depersonalization,etkbsci,t3_cc3hon,1562893971.0,Honestly thank you for this. I learn so much about this horrible disorder every day and reading this was very interesting and gave me hope.
dpdr,etghcpx,t3_cber2u,1562791004.0,yes it’s so frustrating :( some classes at school require a lot of reading and i can’t even get myself to start because i know it’s gonna be a mess
Depersonalization,et4sbrf,t3_c9oiyu,1562456478.0,"it was hard for me at first to find a therapist to help me. a lot of them (surprising to me) sorta had to let me go because they weren’t experienced or educated enough on the topic. i found a reliable therapist and for a while i took a low dosage of anxiety medicine prescribed from a psychiatrist and it actually helped. back then, i never understood how closely related anxiety and dpdr were too each other so i was hesitant at first to take it. — therapy might be a scary thought at first but honestly if you find the right help and not give up, you can learn a lot from doctors and professionals who see dpdr from a different and usually more clear point of view. it’s tough to completely understand what’s going on when you’re so low sometimes and have a foggy head space. good luck!"
dpdr,et4rhxz,t3_c8ura9,1562456003.0,movies (usually in the movie theater) are the absolute worst for me. it’s such a “high” to watch them and i get so into it but right when the lights turn on and we’re ready to leave i’m like wait where am i.
dpdr,et4qqx0,t3_c9xkso,1562455550.0,"i have had dpdr for about 5 years now. the disconnection to family members is very scary and next to not recognizing myself, is definitely the scariest. i personally try super hard not to think about it when i’m with them. i “accept” that they feel like strangers to me (even though i know them and have many memories) but after, i try my best to move on from that and not let it scare me. it took a while to not be freaked out but i’ve noticed that acceptance to this issue actually makes it better and helps me not think about it as much anymore. more recently i’ve been less disconnected to them by creating new memories that i try to think about a lot. “normalizing” your feelings that you have might help you. stay strong, i have gotten a lot better over the years and i can tell you that even though i have random low points of dpdr, i have been able to cope better by calming my anxiety and accepting this as how things are now. keep pushing through and best of luck :)"
HIMYM,eszixew,t1_esz7mi3,1562362816.0,update - it was! thank you so much!
HIMYM,esz7prs,t1_esz7mi3,1562356763.0,thanks! hopefully :)

selfharm,er9ry4o,t3_c0u9gf,1560628793.0,that’s awesome :)
SkincareAddiction,er6ikl8,t1_er6ih0w,1560548583.0,yeah honestly i might go back and get the foaming one that one is probably better for me anyway!
SkincareAddiction,er6i6oz,t1_er6foea,1560548329.0,"i’m no expert (sorta new to all this) but make sure the cerave cleanser you’re using is for your skin type. i got one not too long ago and mistakingly got one for dry skin and it made my face too oily (i have oily to normal skin). 

also in regards to a stronger soap, maybe find a good deep cleansing scrub to use once or twice a week in replace of your normal routine. you would only wanna use it at night since it’s stronger, it’ll open your pores more and expose it to dirt and oil you collect on your face through your the day! 

good luck! :)"
selfharm,er47lok,t3_c0chbs,1560483163.0,hell yeah! one month felt like a huge milestone when i hit it. get excited for more :)
