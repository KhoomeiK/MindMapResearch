Seriously that‚Äôs a 16% tip, a reasonable amount for this situation. Just let it go.

assholedesign,fn8jzj3,t1_fn8hrfc,1586743379.0,"This is true, but you have to remember that it‚Äôs all relative to the time period. We have the ability of hindsight and can see how much simpler games were back then vs now. The thing is when that game came out 10, 15, or 20 years ago it was likely the pinnacle of the technology at the time. We can look back on games like Doom, Crash Bandicoot, or Super Mario 64 and objectively see that they are much simpler games than what we have today. The reality was that they were cutting edge at the time, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with the development resources, technology, and console limitations available to them. They did all that without major game breaking glitches and issues like what exists in many games today because they had to. Once it shipped there was no going back. 

I‚Äôm not saying that developers shouldn‚Äôt be able to fix their games after release, I‚Äôm actually extremely happy that they can fix things so quickly now so games like No Mans Sky and hopefully Fallout 76 have a chance at life. And I‚Äôm positive that there are many developers from the past that would have loved to fix glitches in their games before release. But modern developers shouldn‚Äôt use the fact that they can fix it after the product releases as a crutch and an excuse to decrease initial quality. When they use the buyer as a play tester there‚Äôs a problem."
