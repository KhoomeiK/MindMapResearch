schizophrenia,fj25cme,t3_fay8fd,1582934938.0,"Hey there brother, are you schizo as well? Just my opinion, so disregard if youd like, but I dated a schizophrenic girl as a schizophrenic fella myself. Although we cared for each other, it became very easy to feed into each others delusions, which in turn made our symptoms worse. It was unfortunatly an unsustainable system. You cant take care of someone if you are unwell, and the same goes for the other side. Just be careful there buddy, and I wish you all the best"
schizophrenia,fizm6y9,t3_f9xlmj,1582866748.0,"I've been rather open recently to my closest friends. I haven't had a negative reaction yet, and it helps people understand my processes and actions a little better. However, when having a conversation and I bring up a rather absurd comment about a topic, people seem quick to dismiss my opinion on the matter because ""that's something a schizophrenic would say"". When an opinion runs even slightly on the edge of discourse, people seem apt to delegitimize it because they are aware of the altered state of understanding that this illness creates.

There has been a number of supportive people that try to go out of their way to socialize with me and include me, but I'm not exactly certain about the nature of such actions. They may be supportive because they truly care and want to help, or it could be some kind of pseudosupport that they give in pity because they ""feel bad"" for me. Regardless of this differentiation, I still respect them for treating me more or less as they would anyone else."

schizophrenia,fipd327,t3_f8zwue,1582603626.0,"They say their fair share of vulgar, aggressive things. However, even though the things they say are inherently negative, it's usually framed in a manner that makes me perceive as though they are trying to genuinely help. They call me worthless, stain on society, I need to hurt myself and say I need to cut my arm open (negative). But these properties are made by the leeches that live in my blood, and by cutting myself, I can force them out of my body. Without parasites living in my blood, I can achieve more, be happier, help those around me. The voices want me to hurt myself to make myself better, because they care, and they only want the best for me (positive). Its a very difficult game to understand if what they say can actually be helpful or the complete opposite."

It stopped my ability to determine if my hunger was satisfied, so I ate constantly without thinking I should stop -thats probably the worst part.

But it did help to stop hallucinations in a rather short period of time. Just know when you take it, you'll want to sleep A LOT. Dont let that get in the way of trying your hardest to be active."
