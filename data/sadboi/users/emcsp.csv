Anxiety,fqvuj6g,t1_fqvt23z,1589685496.0,"Thanks for this. I always seem to forget about small steps and get discouraged easily. Any setback with anxiety feels to me like a huge failure. 

I miss coffee so much! I haven‚Äôt had any in over a year, it was too much for my anxiety & IBS to handle. I‚Äôve even given up tea at this point, which also sucks. 

The exercise thing is tricky for me since shortness of breath and chest pain have recently become symptoms of anxiety that I deal with daily. I do some yoga and go on walks, but anything more intense than that makes me worry that I‚Äôm going to just drop dead. Really irrational, I know, but for some reason knowing how stupid it is doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. I still have the physical symptoms and get freaked out by them no matter how many times I tell myself it‚Äôs probably just anxiety."
Anxiety,footmk4,t3_g6crks,1587946206.0,"I have this as well. It comes and goes every day, along with shortness of breath and chest pain. Do you also have the shortness of breath, or is it just a lump in your throat? I do think that acid reflux can also cause/exacerbate these sorts of symptoms."
Anxiety,fll4xyv,t1_fle7gpg,1585253703.0,I‚Äôve been going through this same exact thing for over a week now. How do you convince yourself it‚Äôs just anxiety and not something more serious? There have been moments when I‚Äôve been so anxious about it and convinced that it was my heart/lungs that I considered going to the ER- honestly the main reason why I haven‚Äôt is because I‚Äôd be even more anxious about getting coronavirus in that environment. Any advice on how you‚Äôre dealing with this?

AskReddit,etblqbt,t1_etas5s7,1562651290.0,"RIP Mary. We might‚Äôve crossed paths..

I spent a summer working as a caterer at Mayo in Rochester. Once a week I would go to the oncology floor to restock the pantry/fridge in their lounge area. Patients would sometimes come chat with me during their chemo treatments. 
There was one really nice woman who struck up a conversation with me and I remember that she made a joke about the IV stand she had to wheel around with her. At the time I didn‚Äôt know what to think, but looking back on it now, I can only assume that as a 19 year old kid I was doing a horrible job of acting casual while surrounded by cancer patients, and I think she saw that and was trying to put me at ease. 

Anyways, I‚Äôll probably never go back to Rochester unless I were to get really sick and the only doctors who could help me were at Mayo"
ibs,eszxkwt,t3_c9abxz,1562369489.0,"I switched from Lexapro to Prozac like 8 months ago and Jesus Christ those first two weeks were awful.

Thankfully my body began adjusting after those first two weeks but I remember seriously considering calling my doctor a bunch of times and telling them that we have to try something else. Just stay hydrated and don‚Äôt give up, I promise it will pass!

Side note- does anybody else‚Äôs IBS-D get reliably worse when your eating schedule is messed up? It doesn‚Äôt matter what I eat, if it‚Äôs been too long since I ate last or if it‚Äôs at a weird time, my stomach will absolutely freak out.
