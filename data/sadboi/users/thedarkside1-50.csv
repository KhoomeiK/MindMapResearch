selfharm,fj59tu3,t3_fb2luo,1583027640.0,"i did something kinda similar once. i had this on and off fling with some dude but he was so emotionally abusive and i did one of the deepest cuts i‚Äôve ever done on my thigh because of the shit he was saying to me. i regret it so much now because i was thankfully able to get myself out of that situation but now every day when j see the scar i have these painful flashbacks to that time  and how shit i felt. im not saying don‚Äôt do it because hey do whatever works for you, i‚Äôm not one to judge other people‚Äôs coping mechanisms. hope you‚Äôre feeling better and you‚Äôre able to cut those people out of your life :)"
MadeOfStyrofoam,fivskc0,t1_fivlwcj,1582767110.0,damn that‚Äôs so shit as if she doesn‚Äôt want to help with what‚Äôs probably the root of the problem
MadeOfStyrofoam,fisy46m,t3_f9gq1i,1582696931.0,fuck this is so me. out here saying i‚Äôm 3 months clean what a jooooooke
offmychest,filt3gu,t3_f8ilg5,1582509681.0,"i know how you feel buddy :(
retail employees put up with so much more abuse than anyone should. just because you‚Äôre in a rush or you‚Äôre stressed, doesnt mean you have the right to treat us like trash. we are humans too."
selfharm,fili8g5,t1_filhdam,1582502183.0,"god i can relate to that so much. i literally never bring it up in therapy, not because i don‚Äôt want to but because i can‚Äôt. my therapist had to guess that it was going on too. have you ever talked to her about the fact that you can‚Äôt say it? i‚Äôm wondering whether i should try addressing it or if it‚Äôs not worth the hassle"
selfharm,filhrub,t1_fik3o3o,1582501880.0,i should definitely take up the pointing method. i just stare intensely at who ever i‚Äôm talking to and hope they catch on. can make for a pretty weird situation. and yeah i even find myself getting surprised when ‚Äòcutting‚Äô is used in normal context (like cutting up fruit) word has been ruined for me
selfharm,filhksp,t1_fijy0jl,1582501752.0,i always do that. i have a solid plan of what to say and psych myself up but then go silent when i have to actually say the words. definitely not the only one!
selfharm,fijkgiv,t3_f8063s,1582452200.0,same bro. i‚Äôve been clean for over 3 months now and not to discourage you or anything... but this feeling hasn‚Äôt gone away. I told my therapist about how longs it‚Äôs been and they kept going on about how proud i must be and how good it must feel. didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell them the truth.
MadeOfStyrofoam,fid491f,t3_f7o9aa,1582362089.0,upvote purely because the nickname slicey boi make me do the heavy nose breath laugh thing. also sick as drawing and much proud
SuicideWatch,fi8vfec,t1_fi7pcdj,1582249260.0,i second this
TalkTherapy,fi5k9x8,t3_f6dmz1,1582164945.0,i know it‚Äôs already come and gone but i hope it went well and i‚Äôm really proud of you for going! stay strong reddit friend !!
SelfHarmScars,fi50b7o,t3_f64sub,1582152137.0,i have some like these and they because almost invisible. i can wear short sleeves and no one will question me on it but people who know they‚Äôre there can still see them if it makes sense. it‚Äôs just faint purple lines.
depression,fhw68wj,t1_fhw4mu5,1581907406.0,thank you so much. i go to a therapist as well and i relate to what you‚Äôre saying so much. maybe i‚Äôll bring it up with him next time. thanks for the clarity!!
TalkTherapy,fhvzit2,t3_f4vguy,1581903656.0,"i can relate to this post so much. i have been in the exact same situation as you‚Äôre in and wanted to know all the answers to these questions too, so from experience, this is my best attempt at answering them:

personally, i struggle to actually let my guard down and be serious and it sounds a bit like you do too. i can be talking about how worthless i feel and i‚Äôll have a huge smile plastered over my face even though i feel like crying. I‚Äôve been in therapy for about 1.5 years now and i can‚Äôt give you an answer about how to let your T in because i haven‚Äôt mastered that yet, but, i can say it‚Äôs realllyyyy important to find one you click with. lucky for me, i met mine as the school psychologist and i had known him from running coaching so i tried just talking to him on runs to see if we had much in common and if i could maybe trust him one day. long story short, i saw him for a year at school and then continued seeing him after graduation in a private practise.  so find someone you at least like, and see how you go with building trust from there.

for confidentiality, Ts do have a responsibility to tell your parents some things. i‚Äôve struggled with self-harm and suicidal thoughts and after about 6 months of seeing my T, he asked a questions which related to self-harm and i finally trusted him enough to tell him it was something i did. he then said it‚Äôs not something he had to tell my parents so we could talk about it if i felt comfortable. he did also however ask to see my arms so i guess that was a bit of an evaluation about how much risk he thought i was in before he said it could be something we didn‚Äôt tell anyone. i also have troubles with trust so i haven‚Äôt felt ready to mention suicide yet but i‚Äôm getting there. my advice would be to ask about what dusty of care they have/ what they have to tell your parents. i asked this recently and he didn‚Äôt actually mention anything about suicidal thoughts, just immediate danger to anyone (i guess including yourself).

from experience, my T leads the conversation and asks questions so i don‚Äôt have to worry about diving straight into it all myself. he knows i‚Äôm not overly confident with emotions. maybe let yours know that you have trouble opening up but it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre trying to work on. its also worth mentioning that sometime the questions are hard and i find myself getting into a spot where my brain kinda shuts down and i just stare at the floor or away from him. so just know it‚Äôs okay to not feel like you can answer some of the questions so don‚Äôt be worried about that.

sorry it‚Äôs so long but i think i got most of the questions there. good luck!!! it‚Äôs so amazing that you decided you need to talk to someone, even know it‚Äôs so scary. coming from someone who still feels like she‚Äôs gonna throw up heading over to appointments, stick with it, it‚Äôs worth it!"
