dating,fqzc4wh,t3_gl9lu1,1589764272.0,"I mean yeah....you sound pretty pissed but you bring up the rejection thing like it doesn't happen  to guys.....we get rejected literally all of the time lool, sounded a bit demanding of an apology as well. But that's you :) 

I don't talk to many females.....like at all since the majority of them I work with and I don't want to get in that tangled ass mess..... But if I end up ""ghosting"" it's because I'm being sent one word texts or very limited wording that brings nothing to the conversation(s) on a constant basis of being sent such limited texts, or we just burn out on conversation and there's literally nothing to talk about or there, then the texting just slowly dwindles away.....

If it's a hang out in person thing, if it doesn't feel like it's right then feels awkward, then I feel like I'm not worth their time they can do better for themselves (just no connection) then It'll kind of becomes a cats got my tongue situation and I just shut down, anxiety takes over then bam depression.. probably ghosting in the worst way.... They could do nothing wrong! And I just will get like that it sucks.

But honestly I haven't hung out with a female in well over a year, and that was just a get together thing not a 1 on 1 thing and we maybe talked for 10 minutes lol, I haven't had something like that since 2016. Not counting family of course.

Maybe from a stranger's perspective on why some might...ghost...."

dating,fqig7n5,t3_gixzh5,1589395573.0,".....your right though.

Social media, gaming and television addiction has pretty much created a generation of introverts.

With porn, who needs real life sexual attention when you can induldge all day at home.

(I personally believe that the 4 reasons I gave above are HUGE factors to mental Illness. Take it how you want people.)


There is a lot of choice out there but then again alot of those who actually go out and about are normally already taken! And those who are single are normally the ones staying at home.... Or so it seems.

I've never done tinder or any of those types of platforms.... It seems like it's nothing but quick hookups and nothing more and that just sounds as lonely as being single.....but with benefits .

Also living at home still doesn't help with the dating scene either..... Lack of privacy, no freedom as to where you spend your time indoors if someone else is home and whatever else you can think of.. Plus it's unnatractive to women that are single if your still at home with the folks it seems! (Or at least to the women I've been interested in that is.)

Then if you want to move out you've pretty much gotta move in with somebody else. But are they financially responsible? Is she financially responsible? There's a lot of financially irresponsible people out there which is another factor to think about when it comes to dating. (I've heard so much bitching about money problems all my life and omfg it's a big fear factor when it comes to thinking about dating)

If your into the outdoors! Is she going to support that such as hunting or fishing, will she join along on a hike? I've met plenty of girls who think hunting is a bad thing and fishing is boring and hiking is pretty like much having a 1 hour picnic outside. (No lol) 

I dunno. The dating game is rough so is life. Hell I'm in my late 20's... I hope I dont have to wait til I'm in my 30's or 40's to find someone."
