But what the heck does that change? You feel better? What does that change? Does morality exist? How does it exist without a God? Why should we live if life is suffering and we just get older and uglier? How about that? Why is that just handwaved away like it's nothing.

Mushrooms do not have any answers to these questions, they make you feel good and disconnected from ""self""(no matter what flowery language you use to describe feeling good), and that's it.

It's just another stupid, worthless distraction. Like sex, or relationships, or video games. Just biological programming.

 That's apparently all there is to life? If it is, suicide is the only answer for me.

*No he didn't.* It was pure insight caused by meditation. Not some drug trip. You clearly seem to know absolutely nothing about Buddhism considering that the Buddha instructed his followers to not engage with any mind altering substances. Look up the ""5 moral precepts"" and educate yourself."

SuicideWatch,fpbvnjq,t3_gcbei2,1588479918.0,I think society needs to have a genuine conversation about providing legal and relatively painless death with dignity for people who want to exit this awful world rather than just hand-waving it off.

SuicideWatch,fpbsa9m,t1_fpbrl8g,1588477458.0,"Unless you believe that lifting people from a state of poverty/addiction/depression with welfare is a *net* waste of money (which is a position I'd be very surprised to see on reddit dot com), I don't think this arguments works. Because making people stop being depressed: whether that is done with telling them lies, or locking them up in mental institutions for a period of time, or making suicide hotlines, or providing them with distractions, or giving them drugs, is expected to turn them into generators again. Generating enough to make up for the losses.

In short, what society wants depressed people to do is stop being depressed so they can go back to work and start generating money and babies again. Someone being depressed and draining, even if its for 5-10 years, can really put a whole lot back into society with the rest of their life if they revert to being a good citizen who doesn't dare to be unhappy with the state of life.

Again, I don't think that's evil. It's natural. But there's just a certain dishonest nature to the entire thing that I cant quite articulate. They hand wave the core issue at heart, at least for me: that God, the afterlife, or genuine goodness does not exist, and cover it up with distractions, happy pill popping, or just stupid reddit-esque-hedonism (""Just have some sex maaan"" ""just get high maaaan"", ""just play video games, maaaan"")."
SuicideWatch,fpbqyad,t3_gcjp05,1588476517.0,"The reason why the pro-choice position on suicide is not allowed by society is because it's in society's best interests to keep people alive because they produce labor and participate in the economy.

Yeah, I know this sounds Joker-ish, but it's true. Human capital is a resource people want to use, no matter what lies people use to cover that up.

I really wish people actually sat down and talked rather than give this bullshit lies about ""oh, but i love you! smiley face!"" pretending they care for 2 microseconds then go back to being totally indifferent to the suffering of others.

This world is full of two-faces and liars. It's all PR. Nothing is real. But really, I can't fault them. What else can they do? They just wanna put bread on the table and keep the cogs running. I don't think that's evil. Just human nature. The problem is that when we find out that this whole ""oh you're special, you're loved, you can do anything, you're the best"" thing is at the best, only a half-truth, and at worst, a total lie, it ruins us. At least I feel that way.

Your pretty colors drugs don't do a goddamn thing. All you realize is that ""self"" is an idea humans borrowed to handle difficult concepts and continue existing biologically. It doesn't exist. And you don't need some peabrained drugs to figure that out. The BUDDHA figured that out by sitting underneath a freaking tree.

And if it's the ""experience"" that you wanna give, that's stupid too. You think giving someone pointless distractions, aka, pretty colors, is going to make them suddenly have the will to live? Really? That's so unbelievably dumb and hedonistic and I've had enough of seeing this on reddit."
