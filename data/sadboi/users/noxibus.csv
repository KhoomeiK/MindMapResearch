Right now I'm giving myself some time to recover from a significant relapse, after I want to return to school and start a new career doing something where I can help people and stay social (currently in a field which is incredibly triggering and isolating for me). 

I think the biggest thing here is maintaining some sort of self management and care plan to help manage your symptoms. We are valuable to society; we are creative, insightful, resilient, and we overcome adversity every damn day by just existing. We have a great deal of potential and just need the right support. 

Your world will grow and shrink, but so does everybody's. Schizophrenia causes it to change more rapidly and aggressively but at the end of the day it is something which everyone will experience. What matters in the present is making your world your sanctuary and making your little pocket as nice, comfortable, and safe as possible"

schizoaffective,fc2hx0z,t3_efth79,1577361155.0,"I urge you to tell someone, even if it isn't your therapist. Someone that can keep you safe during  your relapses and that can take you to hospital if you accidentally go a bit far and need medical attention. Your therapist shouldn't send you to hospital based on those grounds alone, I believe they need to take into account your situation and how much risk you are currently in. 

I've only ever been hospitalised once for self harming and that was when I was trying to operate on my leg at home because I thought there was an implant in my leg. Told my psychiatrist and I got promptly sent to my local hospital for the day. That is a situation where I clearly posed great future risk and tbh I'm glad they sent me"

schizophrenia,fc2hlhy,t3_eft7jc,1577360666.0,"Generally speaking only a psychiatric assessment team can offer a diagnosis, and it can take a long time to come to a diagnosis. You may fulfil all seven diagnostic criteria but you may also experience additional symptoms ect which need to be taken into consideration. Having the 7 criteria doesn't automatically qualify you for a diagnosis just because manual illness has so much nuance, comorbidity, and overlapping symptoms. 

When I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective I had to go to four assessments which took around 11 hours in total at my local psychiatric hospital (thankfully outpatient), you'll be asked a ton of questions and it can feel very grueling but it's important that your care team know exactly what is going on with you. My partner and family were also contacted to find out their perspective on my illness.

I think it would be beneficial for you to request a meeting with a psychiatrist, they deal with the medical aspect of mental health and often work with therapists and psychologists to create diagnostics and care plans. I think that the sooner you can get some clarity on your situation the better as it means you can start getting a care plan together with your mental health team.

If you have any questions please ask away, I'm by no means an expert but I've recently been through the process and can offer a friendly ear. Take care of yourself"

It's a very normal response to trauma and probably helped you cope. Our brains are very clever and work hard to protect us, and dissociation is one of the things it does to guard us from our trauma.

I have serious problems with it in my adult life, and in all honesty I thank it for getting me this far.
