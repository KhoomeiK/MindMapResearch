FiveFingerDeathPunch,fqr7w1m,t1_fqfwqxn,1589579244.0,"That's the beauty of artistic expression. It doesn't need boxed in. Arguably, _it shouldn't ever be boxed in._
Five Finger Death Punch have songs with lyrics such as ""To all (...) and *the bottom feeding scum""* (in Death Before Dishonor, he expresses his disdain for poor people and the disenfranchised) and in ""I've got your Six"" He expresses that he has your back, he'll be there for you until death etc... Meanwhile we're inspired by ""Coming Down,"" which in my interpretation is about _not_ lowering yourself to the level of those less moral (He seems to struggle in a way between whether or not he should SAVE those who seek to harm him. I choose to believe that he chooses to save others in the end.)

I mean, we're talking about the band that wrote ""Wrong side of Heaven, Righteous side of Hell."" The very core of the band is about _breaking_ the norms, being the strongest/bravest/most compassionate and fearless badass version of you, that you can be. There is no right or wrong way to be _you_ (if you aren't hurting anyone) and you are _always changing!_ We all go ""Full Circle"" eventually  😉 There is no _wrong_ way to express yourself.

Sorry this is long. These guys are the best. ♥️ Just some thoughts 😺"
