BPD,fk4h342,t1_fk4fa6x,1583860321.0,"Did you read her post? How is her family being abusive? By breathing around her? How are the kids abusive? By being kids?

She states ""liking"" that people are scared to set her off. She literally says she's GLAD people are walking on eggshells so she can have a better time. Do you know how it feels to make yourself invisible so you don't get a full beatdown (verbally or physically, or whatever) by someone you live with? I'm not being rude when I say that this is unhealthy, harmful, ineffective behaviour. She shouldn't be enabled to behave like this.

I used to be everything she states in her post. My family would avoid me at all costs and keep conversations short and sweet, because I have a disorder that makes it very easy for me to get offended, annoyed, triggered to then starting arguments, fights and situations that then result in extreme, deep rooted guilt that I can't shake off, that make my parents cry and my siblings to start distancing themselves so much that I feel like I don't know them anymore. It's her. She has BPD. Even though it's NOT her fault she has BPD, she NEEDS to improve the way she's dealing with life and treating people. I'm not invalidating her, I'm telling her what I know in my heart is the best thing to do. Seek help and change some shitty BPD traits that I also have."
BPD,fk3e2f8,t3_fg6bsj,1583828944.0,"No. I am not trying to be rude here, but this is not okay. Your family/friends/partner should not feel unsafe, nervous and fearful in their own home. They deserve having a place to relax after long days. They should be able to view their home (or whatever) as their happy place. They should be able to be who they are, express their emotions and do whatever they want if they want to. They're human as well and deserve feeling welcome, free and calm sometimes too. It's not fair to make them feel like a burden. 

I am not judging you because I know where you're coming from. You're not a bad person. I relate to you. I can tell you one thing that I  have learned after realising and \*truly\* understanding how my toxic behaviour was affecting their (quality of) life. After reading books, therapy and hearing (and actually taking in) how I have made them feel for so many years - I cannot put into words the amount of guilt I feel. I don't think I'll EVER forgive myself for making people I LOVE suffer for so many years. Being such a toxic and mean person to my dearest friends/family will forever haunt me. 

You are the one that needs to change. You need therapy. You need to seriously start self-reflecting, you need to start improving yourself  and you need to also find out how traumatic/crippling/life-changing (in a bad way) it is for people to be treated so badly. You're not a bad person. But don't justify your unhealthy, ineffective and unbelievably  harmful behaviour. No way. Keeping up this behaviour will not only ruin their lives, but also your life in the end."
BPD,fk3c2p8,t3_fg8p7n,1583826222.0,"Hey girl <3 I understand how you feel and 100% believe that you're not being dramatic. BPDers are known to be super sensitive and vulnerable, so feeling neglected/ignored/not taken seriously can really cause strong emotions of despair and loneliness. Sometimes I get a sudden realisation that no one really cares about me, and that feeling is literally the darkest, most horrific, painful and depressing thing to experience. At those moments I just don't want to exist. I know how you feel. It's the fucking worst. But you're not alone okay?

I just want to let you know that what you're describing, it's called an ""invalidating environment"", and is unfortunately quite ""typical"" in this situation. When people around you, even the closest ones, don't really *see* or *acknowledge* your emotions/feelings - or tell you to stop whining/being dramatic when they do - it's actually known to be a CONTRIBUTING FACTOR for developing BPD. Being invalidated when you're expressing hurt, happiness, fear or whatever, makes you question YOURSELF for feeling what you feel. It fucks you up mentally, because you don't know anymore if what you feel is justified or ""appropriate"" for situations in life. It's fucked up because as fellow BPDer, I KNOW you're not overreacting or just trying to get attention - it's what you feel. People without BPD literally don't understand because they just don't feel emotions to the extent we do. It's important to remember these people are not bad people, it's not their intention to let you down. People don't know enough about BPD to understand its severity yet. 

An ""invalidating environment"" not only makes us doubt and double-check every emotion we feel for it's ""validity"" and therefore making it more difficult to freely express ourselves so we can move on - it ALSO contributes to developing unhealthy, toxic behaviours as a result. That's why BPDers are sometimes known to have full on temper tantrums/mental breakdowns/crying/yelling/screaming when something (minor) happens. It's because we learn that expressing our emotions ""quietly"" doesn't work. People only tend to listen when all control over your own emotions/feelings is lost.  Because of this, we unconsciously learn that BREAKING (as you mentioned) is the only way to feel heard, supported and loved. TL;DR: you are not alone. What you're feeling is completely valid/understandable. It's not your fault for feeling this way, you didn't choose to have BPD. It's also not fair to resent the people around you, as they (most probably) just. don't. know. 

Are you in therapy? If not, I'd still suggest some books on BPD/DBT that will help you in dealing with this right now. You can also start being more transparent with your friends and family. Tell them about how you feel, work out how they can be there for you and what you can do to make it easier for them to recognise when you need them. XXXX"

relationship_advice,fh92fm6,t1_fh8zvi9,1581372269.0,"Thank you for your mature response even though I was kind of rude lol. Although it might sounds crazy/unbelievable when you value chilling with friends very often and can't imagine a life  without - try to remember people are different and some people can feel genuine, real happiness living a boring life. If you fail believing that, move on  before you pressure her into socializing although she's clearly not looking for that right now.  Especially while she's dealing with some mental health issues, maybe this means that the MOST human contact she is wiling to ""deal with"" is her family and you. 

While she is probably in love with you and loves your presence and company, I wouldn''t immediately extrapolate that as being the only thing that she is living for or something. You're her partner, she loves having you around and being with you. It does not necessarily mean that whenever you decide to cut it off, she'll just die a lonely death because you're a crucial factor in her life. Not being rude, but I think you're just assuming stuff too quickly. She'll be juuuuuuust fine, with or without friends, and with or without you"

She seems perfectly happy having this ""boring life"" for now. She seems content. She's also dealing with mental health issues and seeking help, if that means she's not currently into/ready for creating/maintaining new friendships, why bother?

You feeling like a missing peace sounds more like a personal problem as well as being unable to handle that she's at this point, just content with her life right now. Let he be. Not trying to be rude, but it sounds like you're deciding for her that a life without friends and videogames is UNTHINKABE. Stop worrying about her if she's not actually SAYING that she's unhappy, bored and lonely. Don't pressure her into that lifestyle, ESPECIALLY not when she seems to be doing pretty well while mentally ill. She'll find her friends and hobbies when she wants to and when she's ready"

Your girlfriend is being inconsiderate. She might not give a single fuck and that's okay, but her complete disregard of your feelings, lack of tact and empathy is not a good sign.

BPD,ffhvkzd,t3_etptdr,1579955919.0,"It's not selfish, but it is .... I hate to say it...somewhat unrealistic... This realisation was also hard for me to accept for years, and I kept cutting people out that didn't love me as hard as I loved them. After years of continuous disappointment, I started to see that as BPDers, we just love HARDDDDDDDDDDD, we feel things deeply and intensely and that's something that makes distinctly separates us from nonBPDers, as they as more balanced and just don't experience such extreme emotions. 

I love HARD, I love spoiling the shit out of people I love, I would do it every day if it wasn't weird lol and I'd love to give and give and give and keep giving. It makes me happy. Of course it be fucking great if I would receive an equal ""amount"" of the same back, I realised just recently that it's not really fair to have the same expectations from them. It's even more unfair if you never even discuss/address your expectations/love language and just expect them to magically read your mind and meet your private wishes. It's a tough pill, I know, but I'm trying to really learn to appreciate ANY act of kindness from loved ones, as I'm sure they love and appreciate me as much as they CAN."
