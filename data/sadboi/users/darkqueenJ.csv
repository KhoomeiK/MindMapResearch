depression,er76hcw,t3_brsy1y,1560568565.0,The more I try my best to better myself at work and do something right at work. I get pulled down and picked on for doing something right. Its just hurting me so bad. I'm always depressed now. I used to be so happy what happened? Don't get me wrong there are times where I am happy but most of the time I just sit and cry out of nowhere. The environment at work is so draining. I get looked down on and bullied. I even tell the truth then I get underestimated for the things I do or say. I feel like I have no motivation anymore ever since I have been depressed.
