Respect, kindness, courtesy, etc are properties of the giver and thier capacity not a measure of the receiver. When someone says that respect is earned, I think they mean if you are respectful to me then I will be respectful to you. The problem is that abusive self serving people don't understand this and expect to be treated better because they don't see thier selfish nature or sometimes it's because all the have seen is disrespect and it's all they know how to show. 

A while ago I read an article about a study in a mock work environment that asked some people to be disrespectful and some to be respectful. What they found was disrespect brings more disrespect. That respectful people get promoted faster and that many people dislike thier jobs because they are not respectful and therefore thier coworkers and managers don't respect them."

After about a year, when I felt like ""something bad will happen"", I started telling myself that very few things are worse than what I have already been through. It allowed me to shift my view to ""what is the worst that could happen?"" 

When you start asking ""what's the worst that could happen?"", And preparing for it, you will start to feel more secure in yourself.

Also, the way he will behave now not ""real"". Not only for the newness of the relationship, but also the pandemic. It takes time to get to know someone. Since his mental health is taking a toll, he may need space. And as a side note, he may not have access to medication that he needs to manage his mental health due to the pandemic.

And sometimes, we have to look inside to understand what we are missing or lacking in ourselves. You wanting support from someone you barely know during a global pandemic may mean you really need to work on your own support system and independence. You cannot expect a partner to ""make you whole"" or ""complete you"" especially if that person has PTSD. It may be beyond thier limits. Ie, in a relationship with this individual your ""outside of relationship"" support system maybe more important than it would in a ""normal"" relationship.

Right now, he might not be able to be as supportive to you as you want him to be. There are a lot of things that can go into this.

BPD,fnzvp1m,t3_g4ritc,1587401566.0,"For BPD and some other mental illnesses, depression is a ‚Äùside effect‚Äù or like ""caused by"" the other mental illness. So if you have another mental illness, it's very possible that you are depressed.

More importantly (depression is also important), your BPD diagnosis may be incorrect. BPD has overlapping symptoms with several other mental disorders. For example, ADHD and CPTDS. Since you don't feel that your diagnosis is a good fit, you might feel like you are fakeing it.

Some people believe that BPD is caused by parents not validating your experience. Maybe you feel like you are fakeing because you have been told that you are fakeing.

What's most important is that you decide if you feel like you need help and you try to get it (if you want or need it). Try not worrying about if you are fakeing it, and then talking to someone (therapist) about what happened, and how you think and feel about it. If you feel shame or regret or you want to change, ask them for suggestions about how.

Remember, it doesn't really matter what you have (which disorder). It matters that you are moving in the direction that you want to go. (And sometimes that means the direction you want to go to improve an important relationship)."

All that being said, try focusing on being a friend first. Try to respond by saying kind, emotionally supportive things, and things that validate that thier feelings even if you don't understand them.

OCPD,fn57ift,t3_fzfjnn,1586657800.0,"Since you are saying your wife recently got diagnosed, I am assuming that she is going to therapy with a psychologist by herself. You should strongly consider setting up marriage counseling with that therapist, and maybe a few solo appointments.

First, getting diagnosis like OCPD can be very emotional for the person. Personality disorders are caused by nature and/or nurture. If there is a nurture issue at play, it can be very hard on the person because they have to process some of those old painful feelings. Even nature folks can have some deep wounds. And then of course is the possibility of co-morbid disorders.

Second, the reason you really need to go to counseling as a family is because you cannot lose yourself and have healthy boundaries. Otherwise, you will enable her behavior. It could hamper her abilities to make friends, advance professionally, or raise children. Children btw can have major issues (CPTSD and others) by having one parent with a personality disorder and the other is an enabler. 

You can learn how to do a lot of things like she likes, but it may never be enough or good enough. In these situations, you will have to tell yourself it's not your fault. Potentially, while she is upset at you and thinks it is because ""how hard is it to do x?!?!"". 

 It may leave you feeling inadequate and resentful. These feelings are not productive to the long term outcome of your marriage. If you work with your wife and a counselor, you can learn how to best support your wife and take care of yourself. The therapist can offer you healthy ways for you both to deal with the variety of issues that come with OCPD and newly weds experience."

CPTSD,fkrhnnd,t3_fk4mki,1584469064.0,"I used to wonder this as well. Firstly, you are probably nice to a lot of people that don't take it sexually. You may be seeing confirmation bias by noticing the people who take it sexually.

I think that it is because not a lot of people are nice or act like they care. It's funny how some people think that being nice to them is flirting with them. Maybe it's because they think that someone is being nice to them because they ""like them"" and they are a viable partner. For some, I think it's because they want to feel loved and have a physical love language. And your being nice to them feels good, warm, and comforting.

I tried to move past being annoyed by it, feeling bad for them, but having my boundaries."

For someone who would gain perspective looking at the situation as and adult, it could help. Think parental lack of knowledge situations or maybe slightly mistakes.

But for someone that something wrong happened to (excessive beating, sexual assualt,  long term neglect, etc), you are not going to ""gain prospective"" by talking about it. You can however learn how to manage symptoms and reprogram the brain/ thought process and learn to have a better quality of life."

1.) Are you on any other medications that have headaches as a side effect? Surprisingly, birth control makes headache horrible. Even the insertables.

2.) Have you had a MRI or CT of your head an neck recently? 
If not, and if you can afford it, as your PCP to order it.

3.) Ask your PCP for a paper referral.

4.) Sometimes nuerologist are in network, but not on your insurance providers website. Have you tried calling them and asking if they are in network?

5.) Pain management can also treat migraines. Have you tried finding a pain management provider?

6.) If 4 to 5 fail, call the specialist doctor's office every chance you get to find out if someone else cancelled thier appointment. Someone almost always cancels thier appointment over a 5 day window."

Firstly, is this a permanent or temporary problem? Second, is the sex you have good? Do you think it will stay that way? 

Next, imagine having just had sex and not being satisfied laying in bed realizing that you are not going to have sex again for 3 months. And that sex may also not be satisfying. You might want to masturbate. You share a bad with your partner. Are you going to lay in bed next to him and masterbate? Are you going to masturbate while your partner is home? Will you enjoy it? Will you feel resentful because you are horney and masterbating by yourself while you have a partner in the next room?

If you are not going masterbate, are  you going to eat? Sexual frustration will make you eat. If you eat, how much weight are you going to gain?  Now that you gained weight, how are you going to feel when you talk about lack of sex and he says you are fat? Or not attractive to him?

Just something to think about."

My fiance and I both work at the same company with the same job code. We started at the same income, but after a few years he has gotten better promotions and raises than I have. We choose for him to work overtime while I clocked out after 40 hours to deal with house work.
