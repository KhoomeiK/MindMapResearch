bipolar,ewsk28y,t3_cptvrw,1565729170.0,what an incredible feeling this must be. congratulations!!! go kill it!
BPD,ewl0fcl,t3_cokxa8,1565500738.0,"another thank you, for posting this. there are an overwhelming amount of stereotypes about bpd that people blanket everyone with who lives with this disorder. i have been with my boyfriend for almost 6 years, and not to say we haven‚Äôt had our times of difficulty, it is 100% possible for people to have functional, loving relationships (we just bring some extra spunk hehe). there may be struggles with this disorder, but also many upsides that may take some time to recognize. all in all, you see your wife for the incredible person she is. we move along with some motivation from people like you both :)"

BorderlinePDisorder,eueke2y,t1_eudrhm5,1563746554.0,"DBT was created by a woman who suffered from bpd herself - it teaches regulating coping mechanisms that we can use to help manage extreme emotions, coping with black/white thinking, etc. As someone mentioned there are books you can get to learn about DBT skills! Another option is sourcing out an actual DBT group which is eventually what I ended up doing. I‚Äôm in Canada so it was a bit easier through my family physician, but it was a 20 week program where i would meet with my ‚Äúgroup‚Äù once a week for two hours."
BorderlinePDisorder,eudglp7,t3_cfxdwy,1563716678.0,"These books are meant to offer people a better understanding of their disorder and how it may manifest. As authors, they have to be careful about what they include, as ‚Äúmedical advice‚Äù should only be provided by trained health professionals. If you‚Äôre looking for something to actually help you learn how to cope with bpd i highly recommend looking into DBT, if you haven‚Äôt already. I found these books helpful to learn more about myself, but ultimately DBT gave me the personal tools to be able to cope with BPD. best of luck :)"
BorderlinePDisorder,etgxyqg,t1_etel0xo,1562801297.0,me too! i actually did my dbt program in Hamilton :)
BorderlinePDisorder,etegzfp,t1_etdwjet,1562732510.0,"i appreciate that! i know our condition can create a lot of barriers, it‚Äôs just a matter of figuring out how to actually cope and get through themüòÖ i‚Äôm in Canada, so i‚Äôm quite fortunate that i was able to be connected with a program run through my cities health science program, although it was about an 18 month wait period. from my personal experience, it was helpful being in a group setting (although at first i did hate it lol) however! i definitely feel as though it wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to go through an online DBT program or via other literature resources. it is kinda ‚Äúsimple‚Äù concepts to read about, just a matter of actually making the effort to continuously implement themüòä"
BorderlinePDisorder,etd35x0,t3_cb2kem,1562698137.0,"i was in university for three years before i finally took a break in my studies for a year and a half to stabilize myself. i finished a 20 week DBT program, stabilized my medication, and overall learned a lot more about myself. my advice would be to first listen to your body, physically and mentally. during this past year i‚Äôve had regular appointments through my schools wellness centre with both a physician and counsellor. i decided to lessen my course load to ensure i didn‚Äôt overwhelm myself - take any steps you need to to be comfortable! there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with taking less courses, becoming involved in any programs your school may have (mine has an accessible learning program where they consider my high levels of anxiety when writing exams, so i write them in a different room with only a handful of people, for example). i‚Äôm almost 25 years old and i‚Äôm finally finishing my last credit of my degree, and i started when i was 19. i‚Äôve learned that i really need to take my time when needed, in the past i‚Äôve only drained myself and in the end not actually applied myself like i would have liked to. in the end, there‚Äôs no timelines or guides on how you SHOULD do things. best of luck :) xx i KNOW you can own this!!!"

Rabbits,er3ex1c,t1_er3bc9l,1560461781.0,"if your bun is any like mine, she might just secretly love you ;) i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it turns around once she‚Äôs spayed!"
Rabbits,er22oye,t3_c01tvc,1560439519.0,"my rabbit did this to me as well! to be completely honest there was a period where i was reluctant to interact with her and felt as though she didn‚Äôt like me. every time she was free roaming, she would legitimately come after me. she would try to bite my back, dig at my legs, etc. if i stood in a position where she couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúget at me‚Äù, she would spend time hopping around trying to figure out how she could - it was exhausting. after she was spayed, this behaviour immediately stopped. i‚Äôve actually developed an incredible bond with her and she‚Äôs very affectionate! (but no more biting haha). 
i would also recommend giving a blanket, as someone already mentioned! my rabbit seems to love to burrow and even play with it if i move it around. i‚Äôm sure you will see some behavioural changes once she is spayed! best of luck :)"

AmItheAsshole,eqc29qb,t3_by1xpu,1559960994.0,"YTA. depending on the context of what your daughter said, she could have been voicing her opinion about how she feels about something. it‚Äôs first unrealistic to expect your daughter to be affectionate towards either of you when she didn‚Äôt receive that throughout her childhood. my parents did the same, & i started to realize this as i grew older and made friends who had families who were affectionate with one another and expressed love. if your daughter is lacking affection at home - it is no surprise she is looking for it elsewhere. furthermore, she shouldn‚Äôt be shamed if she is expressing this. it can turn into a manipulative situation if a child is expected expect her to show affection when her parents have not modelled this behaviour for her. children need affection - regardless of their age."
