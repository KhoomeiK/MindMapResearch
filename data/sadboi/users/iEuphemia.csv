AskWomen,fdv8arz,t3_emzznx,1578744482.0,"I'm very sorry for your loss. My two cats passed away just recently too, but let me tell you about them.

We got them in 2004. They were from the same litter in a pet shop nearby. I'd pop in and see them every day on the way home from school. The runt of the litter took to me, and one of his siblings took to my mum (side note: I encouraged my mum to 'just come and have a look', and those were the famous last words).

They ended up swapping between my mum and I because the runt of the litter was unwell. They were both taken from their mother too early, so when we brought them home, they still needed to be bottle fed. I was reluctant to feed the poorly one because I was only 11 and was scared I'd hurt him. I bottle fed his sister instead and from that moment on, they were permanently bonded to my mum and I.

Izzy and Oslo, they were called. Oslo, the runt, had zero interest in other people. My mum was his whole world. If you met him, you'd think he was your typical aloof cat; not affectionate at all. But as soon as mum was about, he'd turn into an absolute baby. He would curl up on her chest, right up by her face. If mum was ever out of the house, he'd meow for ages until he realised he had no alternative but to reluctantly get attention from someone else. He'd sit on your lap and give you this look that said ""I'm only sitting here because I can't find mum, don't think I like you now"". ðŸ˜‚

Izzy, on the other hand, was the friendliest cat I've ever met. She quite literally couldn't even hurt a fly. On the rare occasions she'd catch anything outside and bring it in, it would always still be alive. She was very good about just dropping whatever it was infront of you so you could deal with it, rather than running and hiding it somewhere.

Izzy was very strange in that regard. She wouldn't kill anything, and unusually for cats, she absolutely adored having her belly rubbed. I don't just mean she'd tolerate it for a bit - I'm talking, if you had the time, she'd have you there all day rubbing her belly. I have so many photos of her lying on her back with someone's hand inevitably roped into the never ending task.

I miss them both dearly. I know people joke about their pets being their children, and I can appreciate that it probably doesn't compare to actually having a child, but Izzy really was my baby. It's hard not to feel that way when I hand reared her when I was only 11.

The pain never really goes away, but it does become easier to handle as time goes on. Right now, it's raw and you're going to be upset, and that's okay. But one day, you will find yourself smiling and reminiscing about a good memory. I promise you that."
