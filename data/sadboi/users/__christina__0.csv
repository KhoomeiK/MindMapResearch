ASU,flso3ta,t1_flsnshq,1585446632.0,So is it combined with your other GPAs? I received a 3.6 for all 3 past semesters so far. Letâ€™s say this semester I get a 2.7. Are you saying they take the average of all semester GPAs (mine in this case would be a 3.4). Would I still keep the scholarship? What does going on probation mean at asu?

aromantic,fj9vjsm,t3_fc5jm2,1583160612.0,"Iâ€™m aromantic and I want a â€˜romanticâ€™ relationship. Although Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship, I imagine having a best friend that I commit to in the future. I have a very strong love for my friend connections and I would give love to my person like how I love my best friends. All relationships are different anyways, and mine would be different in the way that I wouldnâ€™t want romantic dates, romantic gestures, or romantic touching, but I still want a life partner to fulfill other aspects with.  
My relationships would probably be just the same as any other, just an emphasis on â€˜best friend loveâ€™ instead of romantic love, cuz I canâ€™t feel romantic love and best friend love is very fulfilling to me."

If she wants you back or wants to have sex again, let her know what she needs to do to satisfy you. If she changes after this, take her back. If she doesnâ€™t... find someone that can ride you into the sunset"
sex,fhogjc3,t3_f45k9k,1581755536.0,"You should loose your virginity if your interested. Donâ€™t let religion take away certain parts of fulfilling your life. I used to be very religious, however I cannot understand how some people link believing in god and waiting til marriage. I think waiting til marriage for religious reasons only limits your life, learning, and experiences sexually and overall as a person. And hey, if you start having sex and donâ€™t want to do it anymore later along the line for religious reasons, you can always take the Luke P route and re-Virginize yourself."

u_Green_Lightzaber,fdmsnd1,t3_eid14e,1578563801.0,"Is it her ex husband that was physically abusive? I would not call her beautiful if that makes her uncomfortable. And this is because Iâ€™m sure her ex husband used to call her beautiful at one point. When you say it, it probably reminds her of her ex husband once saying that to her and then later on being the person to turn out to be verbally and physically abusive. You doing the same patterns that her ex husband used to do probably puts her in the state to think â€˜my ex husband used to say that to me and he ended up being the worst person everâ€™ and it probably makes her mind go to think that maybe you will turn out like that too.  Not saying you will be like this, just saying I think this is a trigger for her to think of your relationship turning out the way it did with her ex."
