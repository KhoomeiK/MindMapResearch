depression,fbff0ce,t3_ed3h7e,1576808975.0,"The question is it worth it to you. You may not be remembered in 100 years. Your death might not mean much to someone else but does it matter to you. It's only your opinion that should matter to you. Find a hobby or something simple that you enjoy or someone. So please friend, don't decide to leave before you figure this out: What's the biggest thing I've done to make myself happy? 

Just the words of a fellow redditor. PM if u wanna talk."

I don't know if this is any useful but just know there will be a time and that you will find people that you feel you belong with and your cousins will realize how cool it is to hang out with you or not. But either way i wish you the best."
