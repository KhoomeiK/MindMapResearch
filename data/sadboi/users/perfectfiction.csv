I work a salary position now but I always go in at around the same time and I leave every day at about the same time.

I get to work from home so I make sure I’m online the same time and I’m logging off at the same time, but realize that because of my job my log off time may differ. 

Since covid started I follow my wfh routine. I East lunch at the same time, and I try to be done at the same time. Then I make dinner and hangout until bed.

I was the same way, saying nothing was wrong, that it was fine, no big deal. Therapy and medications saved my life. And not everyone needs both some people can do just one or the other. But therapy really helped me in finding ways to deal with those feelings and I still use those techniques almost daily in one way or another. 

I will stress that he has to make the choice himself to do these things and forcing him right away or providing an ultimatum may not be the best. 

When my wife talks to me she is very good at explaining that what I'm doing is hurting her as well as myself but not blaming me for it which is key because normally I already feel like I'm hindering her and that she could do better.

I decided that I needed to work on my well-being and figure out what's best for me. I was single for almost 2 years before I started dating again. My now wife is awesome. She accepts that sometimes I'm manic and sometimes I'm depressed. When I'm depressed I'm the same way, I want to be alone, I don't want anyone around me. She's there, no matter what. She knows that this is how I'm going to be and she's fine with it. Sometimes it bothers her and when it does we talk about it but her being so accepting and supportive is what makes our relationship work. I think that finding someone like that is a very important part of being bipolar. Someone who knows you're going to have good and bad days and doesn't care and will still be there at the end of the day. She makes me feel normal and thats something I've never had before and I think that there's someone like that for everyone. Good luck and don't give up, you never know what can happen."
