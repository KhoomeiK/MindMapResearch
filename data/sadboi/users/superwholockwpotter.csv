birthcontrol,fr03cqw,t1_fqphw75,1589782525.0,"Hello, 

I actually have been to the doctors many times. They’re not quite sure what’s going on. 

My gynecologist says it’s probably not the IUD. 

However, my other medical doctors aren’t sure either and have since recommend me to a gastrointestinal doctor to figure out what’s going on.

 I’m still having pain/headaches, but I’ll definitely update this if I ever figure out what’s causing it. 🙃"

I know that due to pandemic of covid-19 that many colleges are moving to online classes and this can be hard for some students. It can also be hard to learn some subjects this way. Due to this, I have created a Discord to help with this. There is a general chat for any questions you may have with online classes and then there are specific chats for each subject that you may need help with. There are more channels to be added as needed. The more people who join, the more this discord will be helpful to everyone!
