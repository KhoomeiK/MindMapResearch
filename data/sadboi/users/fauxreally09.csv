askwomenadvice,fbzar6j,t3_ef6xfa,1577240486.0,Latisse really does work. I‚Äôve tried a lot of non-prescription lash growers and they (sometimes) work over time. Latisse showed me results in less than a month. I considered getting lash extensions but did not because a friend of mine had itchy allergy eyes and they became very swollen as a result and she inadvertently rubbed some of her lashes off. More extensions weren‚Äôt an option because of the irritation so she had to wait and grow her own out.
