Unless I had some kind of pre-life where could think totally straight and choose to be born on a stupid brain where would do a lot of bad decisions.

Well, this is where we disagree. What I see, is that people has different concepts of good and evil that are settled/conformed on their minds.


If I agree that what is on the Bible is the absolute the absolute truth and everyone has to obey (I'm not saying it is not, nor that it is), I have to say everyone is mental ill, because no one follows it correctly.


But, if Bible is not our font of truth for ""What is good and what is evil"", there is no truth among humans, and everything is opinions.
