Too much and you can get TDP which causes sudden cardiac death.  Unfortunately, I learned that the hard way.

For a couple months prior, I only had a little swelling under my jaw and it went away by morning.  Then, one day “poof!”  It’s been a few days and I’m slowly returning to normal.  It seems like a great solution to over-indulging...until it’s not.  In addition to the swelling, I could hardly bring anything up.  I have a couple broken teeth too!  I think my body just had enough!  I can’t say that I won’t ever do it again, but I learned my lesson for now.  Please don’t start!"
