socialskills,fr1fpq3,t3_gllosj,1589818928.0,"Same here. I am 23-yr olds and I am still trying to break out of my shell. I sometimes have this fear that I will always be stuck in my shell no matter what I do. Sometimes I get frustrated with myself for being shy and timid. Once you reach a certain age, society expects you to “have it together”. So far, I don’t fulfill that expectation (which causes me to feel sad from time to time). Being shy and timid can honestly get depressing. But nonetheless, I keep pushing."
Anxiety,fqklev0,t3_gjd4p5,1589429929.0,I feel the same way. I’m currently a college student and I have felt a series of ongoing emotions. I’ve had good times and bad times during the past 2 months. My anxiety and occasional depression have made me feel hopeless. I’ve been waking up with anxiety and it feels intense. I’m just hoping for better days.
Anxiety,fqkk90p,t3_gj06an,1589429182.0,"This resonates with me. Usually when my anxiety is the highest, I tend to not be rational and lose my sense of judgement (as you described). My anxiety is usually highest in the morning or anytime I wake up. It feels intense. It feels like it’ll never go away no matter what I do. But when it is really high, I tend to need reassurance (OCD compulsion). It really sucks."
Anxiety,fqkjtt0,t3_gjbjup,1589428909.0,I have gotten that feeling before. I don’t have the exact same experience but it is very familiar.
socialskills,fqjom7d,t3_gj44sf,1589412942.0,I still struggle with it. I am attempting to become more confident and assertive but it is hard for me.
Anxiety,fqi4gn8,t3_giwgdk,1589389929.0,I can relate. Some part of me enjoys the lockdown while the other part doesn’t like it. I honestly miss how life was before the pandemic. I feel like my anxiety may be worse after this pandemic is over because of how I’m used to being in the house for so much of the time.
Anxiety,fqi3z9y,t3_giwina,1589389654.0,I can relate. I honestly like the night time more than the day time.
socialskills,fqeq6eq,t3_gi7iz4,1589311768.0,"I definitely understand where you’re coming from. Why do some people suffer from anxiety while others don’t? I think humans will never truly understand what it is like to be in another person’s shoes, even if they do their best to empathize. I think it is just a part of human nature. I think some people don’t have anxiety based on their upbringing. Someone that grew up not being sheltered from the world is less likely to have anxiety and less likely to view the world as a scary place.

But these are just my thoughts."
Anger,fqbxe67,t3_ghoqip,1589245810.0,I can relate to this a lot. I tend to “rehearse” arguments out loud as a way to gain my power back. I often feel powerless and weak during an argument so this gives me some power and control. I know it doesn’t make sense but it is how I cope.
socialanxiety,fq3y8fp,t1_fq1dbxp,1589071660.0,Thanks for the solid advice. I will make sure to remember this. I tried to get out of my comfort zone even though it’s hard.

Anger,fojtbfh,t3_g7tc32,1587828949.0,"You should have an honest conversation with him and tell him about the things that they are doing that upset you. Be direct and straightforward with them. This person sounds like a bully and probably won’t stop until you “check” him. Most bullies will stop once you defend yourself. The more you hold in your feelings, the more this will negatively affect your mental health. It might feel uncomfortable but it will be worth expressing and releasing your feelings in the end. Tell this person to stop and look them in the eye.

If that doesn’t work out, then you can report them to a manager or HR.

In terms of getting over it, you have to consistently remind yourself to not take it personally even though it may be hard. When I get angry, I usually write or take a walk."

I have tried journaling, seeing the situation from the other person’s point of view (which you mentioned), deep breathing, and distraction. Sometimes I hate how much my anger stays with me. I can’t really give you solutions but your situation resonates with me. Just know I can relate.

Sometimes I find that it is best to walk away or separate yourself from whatever is angering you. That is one way that I try to deal with it.

I hope I helped at least somewhat."

I am like many of the posters on this forum. I have some internal anger issues that I want to get better at improving but just like many in this forum, I feel stuck."
Anger,f1x26if,t3_dayp5j,1569792647.0,"I totally relate to your perspective. On different internet forums and in real life, people have talked to me like I'm the bad guy for not wanting to let go of the grudge. I would always feel down on myself for not wanting to let go, but I realize that I can't deny my feelings to keep others comfortable. I would rather be honest with myself about how I feel instead of just forcing myself to feel compassion for someone who wronged or slighted me.

I, too, feel alone in your struggle. I struggle with anger while everyone else seems to move forward and live in happiness."

Anger,f1ww0ln,t1_f1q843u,1569790207.0,"I am so sorry for all the pain you went through.

I can totally relate to some of what you described. Although I am not suicidal or have harmed myself in any way, I can relate to your emotions.

I still hold some bitterness that has decreased over time. I haven't really let go of the grudges but I'll occasionally have something remind me of how I was treated. Then the anger subsequently comes back into my head. It really sucks.

Sometimes I practice deep breathing and do journaling, but these thoughts will come back only to inconvenience me.

I am split between forgiving others and holding onto the bitterness. It is like I have two split people inside. But the unforgiving part seems to take over.

I appreciate that you replied to this post and I want to send some positive energy towards you. Stay strong."

Life has done a fair share of good and bad to me but I learned some crucial life lessons along the way. I am learning to not treat people better than I treat them and I realize that others don’t have the same heart as me, as well as others.

I still feel your pain though."

I’ve been going through a mental rollercoaster for the past month and I am starting to become concerned that I will never get out of it.

I want to go back to that happy person I was in the first three months of this year. It doesn’t help to see others happy and enjoying their lives when I am currently going through a slump. Now that it is summer, I feel even more pressure to be happy because of the weather, the time off from college (college student), and everything else. I feel like I have to pretend to be happy for the sake of others. I don’t want to drain others with negative energy.

I just finished one year of college. I have so much to be happy about. But I don’t feel happy. Since the summer is starting, I feel even more pressure to be happy just for the sake of others. I don’t want to suck the energy out of others with how I feel.

I’ve been sleeping to escape from my feelings. I’m truly scared that I’ll never get out of this cycle. I really want to go to therapy in so I can make some progress with my mental health but I have to wait which is EXTREMELY frustrating. I have no desire to leave my bedroom, or do anything productive.
