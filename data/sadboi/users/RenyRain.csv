AmItheAsshole,ff2z3wu,t3_er5v54,1579529212.0,I don‚Äôt think AITA.. is really the place for this at the moment. Your wife has gone through a Tremendous amount..You need to be ultra supportive of her. It sounds to me like she could be suffering from some sort of postpartum anxiety or postpartum depression. Also a topic that you should tread lightly through.. but carefully mention it. Or maybe have a girlfriend or mom or something mention to her.. while I do agree you should be able to hold your own child.. does sound like there‚Äôs something underlying there...

I do agree with everyone else, reporting them will probably result in some ridiculous retaliation so before doing so definitely set up security cameras everywhere and I would even get a ring door knob. I would definitely be ready for some sort of fight. Not that you haven‚Äôt been fighting all this time but this is probably going to make it a whole lot worse. Definitely report them for taking your packages although if you don‚Äôt have proof of them doing so, not much can be done."

I‚Äôm trying to take each day as it comes. I don‚Äôt plan on divorcing my husband.  We are trying to just work through it and move forward. I think things will be easier when he finds a job. Thanks again.
motherinlawsfromhell,feht4n0,t1_fehr2ok,1579123347.0,Yea me either.. it‚Äôs funny because according to him she told him that I am allowed at her house as long as he‚Äôs there. But I don‚Äôt believe that for second.

motherinlawsfromhell,fehf2gl,t3_ep4q2s,1579115218.0,"So, actually have four children together. Two little girls, two years and soon to be one-year-old.  He has two twin boys, eight years old, from another relationship. 

He doesn‚Äôt live with us one because we just don‚Äôt have the room in my mothers house. He‚Äôs allowed my mothers house anytime he wants to be and he usually is, as much as he wants to be. Everyday he sleeps in ( sleep apnea) then by the time he‚Äôs up and ready- he probably doesn‚Äôt come over until about 1..and then he doesn‚Äôt leave until the girls are asleep. He  doesn‚Äôt sleep over Because I have a full-size bed and our toddler sleeps with us and the bed really isn‚Äôt that comfortable to begin with. He did sleep over on Christmas but that‚Äôs it. 

We are going through bankruptcy so right now we can‚Äôt afford to move in to our own place. We had previously lived together but he lost his job last year. We tried our hand at opening it on our business and it didn‚Äôt work."

So therefore they are not going anywhere without me. I don‚Äôt really talk to him about her unless he‚Äôs annoyed with something she did and then I get annoyed because he didn‚Äôt stand up for himself,  like last night. She brought a drone for my 8 year old step son- and won‚Äôt let him bring it here ( to my moms house where I reside).. it‚Äôs so petty. It‚Äôs a xmas present you gave to him and you know they spend majority of there time here with me so why not just let the kid play with it!?? I‚Äôll just have to buy him one for here.
And I asked my husband if he said anything to his mother and as usual his response was ‚Äú no I didn‚Äôt wanna argue‚Äù.. and you wonder why she gets away with treating your wife the way she does Bc you don‚Äôt stand up to her!"
