BPD,fhwfmu3,t3_f4x9sa,1581914436.0,"I graduated with a bachelors. There were extremely rough times; it was before my diagnosis. I was playing a lot of catch up, taking extra classes during break and all, in case I failed others. Worked to my advantage, I graduated early, which felt like an accomplishment. 

So, I won’t lie, my experience wasn’t the best, but I survived. I have something to show for it. 

When I graduated I walked across the stage waving like a duchess because I earned that degree like a fucking boss."

I’m sorry this post makes you numb. I saw it and thought it was a great way to reach out to many of you at once. It was a blanket statement to everyone: to those who were having a bad day and needed to see it, to those who just come here to read and don’t like participating, to those who aren’t told they’re loved. 

I have borderline personality disorder. Me saying I love you, means I love you and I feel for you. I love all of you strangers.  It brings me great comfort to know I’m not alone and so misunderstood.  

So again, I’m sorry for the way you interpreted this message and how it affected you."

The truth is... some of us were just made this way. With this curse that is sometimes a blessing. With the ability to feel things more intensely than most will ever know."

Many professionals still don’t have in depth knowledge on borderline considering it’s only (relatively) recently acknowledged as an actual disorder.  

If you truly think you may have borderline, I suggest seeking a psychiatrist that specializes in it."
BPD,fbic12o,t3_edj1q6,1576896659.0,"PMDD. My psychiatrist and I just discussed it. She said some women take Prozac (or in my case, extra Prozac) during that time. Sometime birth control can help, but that just fucks with my brain, too."

Sometimes I’m given super powers that make me feel things so passionately. It connects me to people in beautiful ways that people without borderline may never experience. I can have the highest of highs - the brightest of  joys. 

Then the demons come back. It could be within seconds, minutes, sometimes days.
