Maybe you'd still like AC4: Black Flag cuz it builds a little bit on the story arc but really after AC3 it's a new story arc with a less unified vision. BUT more open-ended and more streamlined gameplay. Also the gameplay becomes more like other stealth/action RPG's. Which is great if you like those. But if you want a more unique stealth gameplay then everything before Origins has ""social stealth"" or ""blending"" into crowds. Personally I think Syndicate set in 1800s London does the crowd stealth best. I think Syndicate builds on AC2's mechanics best."

Norse,fp49uft,t1_fp3iwvv,1588294578.0,"Black Flag had the blandest combat I think. But once your out of the intro it's great fun as a sandbox pirate experience. There's only so much variability to that gameplay loop though.


But Black Flag laid the groundwork (building a bit on AC3's side naval missions) for openworld ship stuff. Origins (in Egypt) surprisingly made some use of that and it was at that time that I felt the series could do a Viking game. Early in the series (up to Revelations in 2011 I think) the game was limited to cities, so at first when other fans suggested a Viking setting I thought they were way off. But Black Flag took the game across the Caribbean (scaled down of course) and made it interesting. Origins took it across the northwest side of Egypt. Odyssey did Greece and the Aegean Sea and brought back the mechanic of having your own persistent ship and crew. Traveling ancient Greece amidst a war between Athens and Sparta by boat and horse (and yes, climbing) made for a pretty immersive experience, though not in a historical sense.


I'm really excited to get to travel Scandinavia or the North Sea, or even (judging by the trailer) the British Isles with my longboat! And maybe with those little ponies like they rode in ""Beowulf & Grendel"" (2005) haha!"

I don't remember how much it says of the San Antonio but in support of the above linked response, I know it at least gave a sense of the kind of tensions between Spaniards and Portuguese on the voyage that might have made it easier for the San Antonio crew to convince the Spaniards back home that Magellan was not loyal to Spain: https://archive.org/details/firstvoyageroun00pigagoog/page/n10/mode/2up"

that reminds me I learned from some thread on /r/askhistorians that some Mesoamericans (I don't remember if it was Aztecs or Mayans) had an ideal of a ""flowery death."" I don't remember what exactly that meant but the conquistador's death is a literal flowery death"
movies,fnpn8o0,t1_fnplfj2,1587148479.0,"Every viewer can have a different interpretation, that's something that makes it fun to talk about. I think most people I've talked to (I mean read comments from) agree with you that the conquistador part was fiction within the story. I don't think there's hard evidence in either direction. But for me the relevant parts are the scenes where Tommy said ""I don't know how it ends"" and Izzy said, ""you do, you will."" I think the Queen (Isabella) also says that line. And I think future Hugh Jackman has a vision putting those two previous scenes together.

The later combination of the scenes can be the Space Traveler's imagination or memory, yes. But the line itself from Izzy to Tommy sounded to me like she's saying the book is coming from him (his memory) just as much as it's coming from her (her memory, not her imagination).


Also, there's the detail that breakthrough in the drug Tommy develops comes from a sample of an ancient tree in the Yucatan. So that tree could be the same Tree of Life where the Conquistador dies.


There are other connecting details like the modern character's name is Dr. Tommy Creo. I don't have a reference right now but ""creo"" relates to the word ""creole"" which refers to someone of mixed blood. It's a common term in history of colonization. The conquistador is Tomas. **But I acknowledge that these details can come from Izzy's (Isabella's) imagination.** She wrote a book featuring a historical queen with the same name as her and then maybe made up, or maybe remembered, a conquistador with her husband's name.


These are just theories, possible interpretations. Deciding who's right about each fan theory isn't the fun part, so I'm not trying to *defend* my stance, just share what I picked up on"
