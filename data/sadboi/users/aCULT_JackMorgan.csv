Obviously those experiences aren't comfortable but there is frequently something to face from them. I'm sure you saw a lot of things and some of them you need to face and work through. Try writing some of it out, it helps.  

After you return to baseline (in 1-2 weeks,) have done some of this integration work, and are hopefully feeling a bit better, then as others suggested you couple try a much smaller integration dose of say 1.5-2g and just enjoy nature and reflect on your integration notes.

Shamans are also interpreters of spirit, in a way and depending on the exact shamanic culture.  There is a genuine assistance or transmittal of Truth, then there is fakery.  And the fakery arises predominantly from attempts at power and profit. So mostly, there is an aim to design the system to even the playing field and eliminate the need for profit. Will that stop being from being greedy? Not in general, no. But the culture of an organization can counteract greed, for sure.

Trigger Warning: all the triggers (which are already in this post)

But seriously folks, this is a tough subject.  And Sig, I appreciate your take and candor.  Death of any kind is still hard to talk about for a lot of people, and I suppose I'm one of them.  I want to say, sssh, no, let's not acknowledge that.

The truth is, I don't want to acknowledge that ultimate self-destructive part of myself.  Even if I know I have a that in me somewhere, have thought about it a million times, there's always a twist.  I'm terminal, in a common scenario.  It's the end times, and we're out of food.  It's not really a suicide, I'm just thinking about how to fake my death.  Wouldn't that be fun, starting a new life over after faking your own death?  Because that's how it is when you see no escape from your situation, whatever it is.  Even if from the outside, others don't think you should think your situation is that bad.  Or maybe they would, it doesn't matter.  It just matters that you think it's that bad, because the worst you know is the worst you know.  And depression can feel like physical pain.  But hey, it could be worse?  So, why are you -

Oh, me, I made it about me again.

But it's not.

It's just talking about death, and death's impact on those who care about a person.  And how the manner of their death matters to others.

I had a friend of a friend who hung himself.  He was a super fun dude, we joked around every time I saw him, only his close friends knew he was at that point.  Depression, drugs, no end in sight (to him.)  The person who found him sent a picture to my buddy.  He couldn't get it out of his mind, years later.  Years later he's still stuck on the what-ifs, what he might have done.

I'm the same way with the deaths of one of my close friends.  He didn't outright ""commit suicide.""  He drank himself to death over years.  I might have done the same - I guess still have that in me somewhere too.  And yes, it's selfish, it's narcissistic.  So back to the permissible thoughts, the acquiesced euthanasia.  But isn't that essentially narcissistic as well?  Out of all the human beings that have faced unspeakable deaths, you think you should get to go quietly, easily, at the hour of your choosing?  You still want all that control, eh?  Think you can have it?

If you would get that choice, that control, you'd be in the elite, the privileged. You get more bang for your mental-philosophical buck through these two hot takes: 1) Everyone is on their own trip in life, and 2) You should practice to accept death at any moment. If you're stuck on why someone did a thing, up to and including ending their own life, they did it because in that moment that was what they thought was the best thing for them to do. They got to that point in their life through a serious of experiences and systematic enforcement and interpersonal interactions that lead them to take that action.  That was their trip, and you can't change that, can't control it. Not getting into determinism or fatalism or fate or any of that, just from a human behavioral standpoint (I'm getting out of my element in the territory of that element, forgive me.)  And as for the latter, if you can find a way to live like you're dead, that's a good way to look at it.  You can't do things for image if you're already dead.  Can't be a narcissist, there's no you anymore, you're already dead. Pride, resentment, fear - dead, dead, dead. Accept that you could be gone at any time, and you'll see more reasons than ever to keep living. And more ways not to be alone."

How does one start such an alternative community in less friendly environments, especially without having an angel donor/sponsor who already has significant amounts of land/capital to start the endeavor?  How do you support exchange of goods and services in a cooperative trust model that doesn't unduly burden individuals with catastrophic potential failures?

And yes, it will take real effort by real people and not just typing about it.  I enjoy the anonymity to muse and discuss openly and at will, though, as there are serious constraints on real-world identity in shared reality.  There are levels of information and social filters, all that jazz.  So it's nice to discuss openly on forums such as this.  That is the reason for the emphasis in aCULT on being a theoretical thinktank to aid in bootstrapping these emerging coherence endeavors.

sorceryofthespectacle,fqiikr3,t1_fqified,1589396476.0,"So then you have an issue with your 13 year old self?  Why do you find fault with them?  Interesting.  Yes, all these topics can be seriously studied, obviously.  Should we make everyone get a degree in philosophy to just start to have a normal conversation about the nature of reality?  Not realistic.  I do understand serious study and have been through it, if that makes any difference.  I also think anyone can start to have these discussions and in fact do that with folks from all walks of life and backgrounds all the time.  It's amazing how much common ground there really is, when you don't put up walls to what people are saying.

So again, you're being privileged, idealistic, and naive in your own right.  Even for a well educated middle class person of some means, it's nearly impossible to just immigrate to an EU (or any) country.  If you're super rich, sure.  If you get sponsored by an international company, there you go.  It's obviously not easy, and even if it was, we're not moving everyone in America and should not need to.  The country is probably unfixable, you're not wrong.  So we admit defeat?  Give up?  Accept the fatalistic narrative?  Nah, think we'll shrug it off and keep shoveling.  There's work to be done, and this is all part of it.  We will respect people as people now, in our own circles, with everyone we meet.  We'll connect and lift.

sorceryofthespectacle,fqiblqi,t1_fqhfhy3,1589393818.0,"> Not naive: You mean linking Tysons ""Cosmos"" in your handbook on one page and then on another presenting a one paragraph blurb discussing the ontological nature of objective reality? On one page linking TED talks and then discussing consensus making in laymans terms on another page?

There are blurbs, yes, with links to other things.  It's already very difficult to get folks to read anything very long (these posts are obviously too long for many.)  I'm not sure what you're finding fault with in attempting to pull together in an understandable way the various aspects of shared reality that form the foundation for further discussion of any kind.  We have studied philosophy.  We also philosophize.  Performing actual dialectic is often more instructive than simply reading dialectic.  You can read Des Cartes, but have you been on the same journey starting from nothing?  How would you try to translate a worldview to someone?

As we've said elsewhere, we are aware there are existing systems and organizations going after some or perhaps even all of the same aims.  If it was working so well for everybody, we wouldn't be where we're at.  We could go over the whole history of labor unions, but obvious those have also been coopted for power and financial consolidation, like everything.  If you're in a geopolitical climate where you are provided a real, reliable health system and social safety net, I guess that's great for you.  There are millions, especially in North America, that do not have this at all.  We have a rough illusion of this with a lot of ""buck up and do it yourself"" rhetoric that doesn't cut the mustard when someone's life can be ruined for years or forever by a large unexpected medical expense.  Where it is extremely expensive or impossible for many to get any health insurance if they don't work for a corporation, which then ends up making you reliant on that company to be afford a doctor. Where you could pay into a pension system for years and end up getting nothing. Where you can be fired tomorrow for no reason with no recourse beyond endless lawsuits that make lawyers more rich than anyone they supposedly help.

That aside, here's some answers:
> 1 - Have I calculated my purchase correctly?

Yes, you have.  You will have 15000ug in total, or qty 1500 of 10ug microdoses.

> 2 - Will it last that long or deteriorate before I can use it?

It will last indefinitely if stored appropriately away from light, heat, and moisture.

> 3 - Best way to fit 1cP-LSD around ADHD meds?

[Search the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/microdosing/search?q=adhd&restrict_sr=1) for existing replies around this.  Some folks want to entirely replace their ADHD meds, others alternate, others blend.  Your mileage may vary.  I would say don't take on microdose days, and on off days see how you feel when you wake up and decide.  Might depend on what you have to do that day.

> 4 - Can I carefully co-pilot 1cP-LSD alongside psilocybin on the same day to get focused followed by. relaxed response?

I wouldn't think of psilocybin as a relaxation enhancer, necessarily.  Yes, you could take both, but your results may vary.  In a way, it's going to be kind of wasting the mushrooms dose, though, as the LSD effect will overshadow psilocybin effect at microdosing level, in my experience.  If doing this at recreational doses, there is an additional psychedelic component introduced that changes the headspace, but again, I wouldn't say it's relaxing necessarily.  Try both individually, then try combining if you want, and let us know how it goes :)

> 5 - How micro can I go to facilitate a smooth/gentle up and relaxed down?

Essentially you're asking a different question around number 4 here.  And no, I would not take psilocybin at night before sleep when doing LSD MD during the day.  As you already noted, you're going to have to watch the hyperfocus/manic tendencies you already have when doing MD, and psilocybin at night won't help that.  CBD is good, keep that up.  Meditation is key.

> 6 - Bitcoin - who he?

Bitcoin is a cyrptocurrency.  It can be used as an investment medium, like FIAT currency trading, or to facilitate purchases of goods and services.  Head over to r/bitcoin to learn all about it.

It takes groups of individuals cooperating to maintain cooperation, not an enforcer at the top, no matter how corrupt or whatever, they operate as the figure head. It comes down to small factions of people deciding they want to be cooperative with each other, forming cooperative conglomerates of individuals which forms a larger cooperative unit, these cooperative units cooperate and form larger cooperative units and so on.. this is why small communities are so much more cooperative and successfully run than large cities, less crime, etc, people are generally more cooperative. This, I believe is because there is reputation and there are stakes in the game in cooperation where  as in large cities you can defect over and over again and get away with it. It think this is why globalism under one ruler has led to uncooperative societies that are now relying on a reputation system in larger areas like China's social credit scores and militarization of their communities.

> In evolution, we see cooperative units forming out of smaller units in the case of Eusocial insects, and slime molds. Its never cooperatively enforced from above rather enforced by the eusocial workers themselves (cooperative anarchy of nature :)) rare but it happens! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_eusociality in this case we see multi level evolution happening as larger and larger conglomerates form larger and larger cooperative units.

> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC23686/

> I find this fact fascinating because it takes the very small and scales it up to the very large in a way that can be applied globally and universally. We are ruled from the bottom up, from the very small to the very large. laws of physics explains the behavior of the atom explains the behavior of atoms together (chemistry) then chemicals together forming biological units, unicellular biology to multicellular biology, groups of orgisms, social hierarchies, etc.. It happens from the bottom up. 

> Hence why I believe in small govt and human rights ;)

> So also random, in regards to your comment of why it wouldn't make a difference to light yourself on fire to change the leaders at the top, or when political mutinies happen and after a coup the country falls into poverty and despair because there is no plan to enforce cooperation from the bottom up. People are still reliant on the hand of the govt in these hostile regimes. Jack-- lets start a cult lol!

I would agree that the truth is, the more scientific - detailed logical and rational analysis - you get on conscious experience, the more ""irrational"" you sound to mainstream society and academia. Not being able to calmly and rationally have a dialectic without devolving into name calling and arbitrary appeal to authority would seem to only serve to invalidate the argument. If you're secure in your beliefs and they are coherent, then you don't need to get upset. I'll admit, it takes a long time to get there. Did you know humans don't like the feeling of having conflicting thoughts around the nature of their conscious experience?? ;)"

Then you notice, no, you can remember everything just fine, but you remember it differently. It's like the memory isn't about you anymore. At the time I was focusing a lot in meditations on tearing away parts of myself, attachments to aspects of my personality and life. It's incredibly freeing. Also, it's... strange. Others have also commented on an uneasiness about not having an internal monologue anymore or not feeling anxious. You've been so used to having your ideas of yourself, your internal chatter, your time consuming anxieties, that now without them, it feels somehow empty. Better, but still empty. 

This is the opportunity for the next phase, though - filling yourself back up. Take that space that anxiety and chatter had and fill it with pursuits or entertainment you value. Take the unhelpful stories you used to tell yourself and instead write a new story, a true one, looking forward and not backwards."

That is, there is work to do along with MD as a medicine.  Eating well, exercise, and meditation are all excellent recommendations.  However, if one is currently incapable of those things and looking to MD as a tool to help gain the motivation and energy to do it, that's completely understandable.  You say not to use a crutch, but what if your leg is broken?

OP, u/H2hO96, sorry if you felt put on by these comments.  From their post history, I think Lizard means well.  Their experience and expression of MD usefulness could differ from others, and they seem to be advocating for supporting practices, both before and during an MD regimen.

Sure sure, anything could be another OCD trap. It's a series of rabbit holes. That's part of getting out of the loop. 

I had my original OCD crisis 18 years ago by now and had other things to work with/through. Everyone's internal headspace is different, and I think you have to go on an individual journey to healing. In retrospect, one of the obvious things for me around initial onset was that I wasn't getting sleep, had a ton of stress, and felt I couldn't control many aspects of my life. So OCD symptoms were expressions of a need for control, and directly addressing that desire for control was key to stopping the compulsions.

I have also over the years personally developed the mindset that indeed ""my"" thoughts aren't ""mine"", related to obsessive or intrusive thinking. This is also reflected in the ACT saying, ""You are not your thoughts."" Thoughts are information. Where you feel the information comes from is a matter of personal worldview. Intrusive thoughts by their nature can be very disturbing. Feeling somehow responsible and identifying with all the thoughts that come to one's mind is not accurate or helpful. As a friend of mine says (and he got it somewhere else,) ""You can just let thoughts walk on by, but you keep inviting them in for tea!""

Hope that helps you and others on the same journey. Namaste!"
microdosing,fnnulud,t3_g2m9vj,1587102210.0,"Psilocybin has helped tremendously over the years dealing with OCD symptoms.  It's certainly not a magic bullet by itself, but it really helps be able to deal with and mitigate intrusive thoughts and compulsions.  The emerging evidence of the Default Mode Network involvement in OCD, anxiety, and depression, along with classic psychedelic's ability to dampen the DMN, seem to explain the mechanism for this.  Therapies such as CBT and ACT are also supported by MD, it would seem.

For me, personally, it has been helpful in the development and reinforcement of mental routines to escape from obsessive/intrusive loops.  Develop a personal routine for letting go of your thoughts - whether that is focusing on sensations, breathing, gravity or simply just remembering to let go and refocus back to something else - and then use a motto as a trigger to get into that routine.  Psilocybin MD helps to reinforce the reprogramming and activation of those routines.

Hope that helps!  Feel free to hit me up if you have more questions :)"
