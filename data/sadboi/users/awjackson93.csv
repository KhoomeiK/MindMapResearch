progun,f0xa732,t3_d6t2nw,1569026362.0,Ironic.
SandersForPresident,f029i5b,t3_d2wkv3,1568326176.0,How about neither.
progun,f029g7e,t3_d3e4d0,1568326144.0,"The issue here is transparency in my opinion. If something in vapes could kill you, that information should be made public. Then let the adults make their own decisions."
politics,eztxpjk,t3_d285va,1568140986.0,"Instead of looking solely at the gun issue, which does in fact infringe on the rights and freedoms of individuals, why not take a more comprehensive approach and address the root of the problem which is mental illness? No one ever talks about that. They only address the weapon used."
guns,ezskmpy,t1_ezskcde,1568095351.0,"I know but I feel like they're gonna cave and compromise on something, based on what I've read. McConnell was on a radio show recently and talked about this."
guns,ezskfqo,t1_ezsk89p,1568095113.0,Uh-oh. I didn't read the rules.
guns,ezskf8k,t1_ezskel5,1568095096.0,Nevermind I guess not if it's not a gun at the time lol.
guns,ezskel5,t1_ezsk1za,1568095072.0,Yeah but you'll still have to give that up won't you?
guns,ezsjtet,t1_ezsjii6,1568094371.0,"So you're in the clear now unless they pass a mandatory gun buyback at some point. 

It sucks that I have to choose which platform I would use if I could only have one."
guns,ezsjqgj,t1_ezsjhsw,1568094273.0,I may have to. The stock that comes on the model I want is super nice though.
guns,ezsjodv,t1_ezsjk7y,1568094203.0,Thanks lol.
Anxiety,exk99da,t3_cq2yu2,1566379716.0,All the time. I really just want to not care if people like me or not and constantly seek other people's approval.
movies,ewho49h,t3_avpr4v,1565414825.0,The critics are pretentious as hell and seem to base their opinions of movies on the diversity of the cast and the inclusivity of marginalized groups.
tifu,ep1n925,t1_ep1h774,1558991649.0,"Alright. By preferring to associate with people of my own race that does not automatically mean that I'm discriminating or being prejudiced against anyone else. Your definition of prejudice requires that I have defined opinions about people of other races but if I just prefer my own race then I'm not being prejudiced. 

I'm also not treating someone else unjustly simply by preferring my own race; I'm not treating them in any way at all. Therefore simple preference is not racism. 

Maybe I still need to explain how criticizing another race is not racism. Criticizing someone who happens to be of another race is not racist if the criticism has nothing to do with their race. If however you are criticizing a common practice or belief of a particular race, that is still not racism because the criticism is not of that person's racial identity but of their actions or personally held beliefs."
tifu,ep1gqp7,t1_ep18c1l,1558988969.0,Show me where I can find that definition of racism.
tifu,ep0x787,t3_btm7ss,1558981598.0,Racial bias isn't racism and neither is a simple misunderstanding. Truth is that most people prefer their own race and criticize people of other races.
