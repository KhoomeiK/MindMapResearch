I‚Äôve been walking, 3 mi several times a week, but with the gym closed nothing else.  Never thought this would go on this long!

Also I'm so happy that you have a psychologist and community support.  You are on the right track with exercise and socialization, despite the stigma, which is so damn ancient.  Keep on, our world needs enlightened ppl like you"

I‚Äôm in US, but I imagine all cultures are behind the times in understanding this very real, very organic health issue.  Keep being open because the stigma needs to stop.  Also, thanks for the affirmation üòò"

Ate healthy yesterday and today but forgot to log dinner yesterday.  Tryna get the water habit going!!

It's just a box cake mix (chocolate) and an icing that is whipped cool whip and pudding.  Any suggestions appreciated.  I did find online a away to make icing with coconut cream."
bereavement,erg6gpc,t3_c0g7z4,1560827871.0,"First, you are a special human being because you appreciate this second dad.  Your heart is in the right place.  Now second, lighten up on your self.  Us old people don't expect anything more from you young ones.  We want to see you live your lives, not come change our Depends.  You expressed your love; Dad2 heard that and was proud of you.  Next, your dad will grieve in his own way.  You don't need to be responsible for him, he's an adult and he raised a genuinely good person, so he's likely a good guy and he will come to terms with his loss just as you will.  Hang in there, take good care of you because you seem like someone special."
bereavement,erg605i,t1_erbabsc,1560827467.0,"Delicate time, yes.  You did the right thing.  You n Mum are close, dad is gone, nothing will replace him....she is going to grieve.  Baby news may temporarily soften the blow, but that's a huge loss.  And baby news is a HUGE blessing!  I've learned volumes from GriefShare (USA) and suggest you all read, go to counseling, any healthy way to cope with a huge loss.  I won't do it justice, but they give you advice like ""don't focus on what you've lost, focus on what you still have.""  Has helped me with losing a son.  Grief takes actual work to get through, but it is part of life."

BipolarReddit,eohgmsl,t3_brok6i,1558581051.0,"Just a mom here, no credentials but recognize the amazing advice offered by others. Picked up on the ""love of your life"" loss, and for what it's worth, I know of people who got back together.  We are all attracted to people who we think are stronger or better or smarter in some way, so put your not-so-fashionable oxygen mask on you for a bit.  That love may return.  If not, believe me, you are stronger and wiser after the oxygen and will figure out what is best to partner with.  Sending a virtual mom hug."
