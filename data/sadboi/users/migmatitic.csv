PoliticalCompassMemes,for9zqv,t1_foq6b74,1588008693.0,"Did I stutter? 

The focus on identity politics has been the demise of libleft. The role of the polity, and its _sole reason for existence_, must be to dismantle those organizations that wish to threaten the intrinsic liberties of the people. For this reason, a libleft government must inherently be anti-fascist. 

However, capitalist power structures also threaten the intrinsic liberties of the people. To this extent, the government must also be anti-corporate, and ensure that human corporations do not concentrate financial power in the hands of a select few. The _corporate_ work of many must produce the _corporate_ reward of many, or the leadership of the corporation is engaging in theft from the common man. The government's role is also to protect unions of workers. 

Local capitalism is a good thing. It is the kind of trading, bartering, and selling that advanced humanity beyond hunting & gathering. Corporate capitalism, and the use of financial instruments to manipulate the economy and subjugate the worker, is immoral.

But even the best-intentioned organizations, when given power, are corrupted. So the people must be armed, skeptical of their government, and politically invigorated. Yes, that's right, give _everybody_ guns, and they will defend their own rights. 

So to summarize: I don't care what that man believed. If you call yourself a believer in freedoms yet call the act of holding certain beliefs tantamount to thoughtcrime, you are a hypocrite. That man fought a government which had turned against its own people. That man fought an ideology which exalts nation above citizens. That man fought a tyrant who had stolen political power from the very persons he tortured to death.

That man is an anti-fascist, and he has my complete respect."

RealSolarSystem,fop0if1,t3_g8qgq2,1587950394.0,"Build from the top down. Here's a very standard two-stage lunar landing setup:

Final descent stage: using the best RCS fuels you have access to, add however many generic thrusters you need to get a _lunar_ TWR of ~1.5 (generics are infinitely restartable engines burning RCS propellant. Throttle not needed for fine control if you pulse on & off). You only need ~400 m/s, just enough to have a controlled landing during terminal descent (when you're falling straight down)

Braking stage: this will kill your velocity when you're arriving at the moon. No need to go into orbit first; it's wasteful of dV. Should have ~1.6 km/s, enough to kill your horizontal velocity (if you have much--coming straight down out of the transfer is optimal) and slow you to about 200 m/s low over the surface, at which point your terminal engines will take over. Only one ignition needed.

Transfer stage: this needs to have 3150 m/s dV with payload. It will take you from earth orbit to a lunar intercept trajectory. Only one ignition needed.

Launch vehicle (multiple stages): ~9.2 km/s dV with payload. Doesn't matter how this is staged, as long as it puts the mass of your lander+braking+transfer stack into LEO. Only one ignition needed per stage. Once you're in orbit in the plane of the moon (or not), you'll use your transfer stage to execute the TLI burn. No restarts required.

If you have left over dV, it means you're overbuilding & can use a smaller design."
