Even before that when they said hurtful things, he always acted like he was okay. But I could see the hurt in his eyes for an instant, only an instant but that was enough.

I can't just let that happen to him. I can't let him go through the hurt and fear alone. We're partners. We're there for each other.

I'm not therapist but after my mom abandoned me I had a step mom. She hated me and treated me terribly, but I wanted a motherly figure. I wanted it so bad that I didn't care how she treated me. She wouldn't let me participate in things, and made me feel like a freak. I had to be normal.

I think that something like that is what's going on with my husband. He's so afraid that they'll leave that he'll put up with it. He was sort of abandoned too, it's hard to explain, but I feel like that's what he's doing right now. He wants to appease them.

Get away from her. This is abuse. You didn't give her enough attention so somehow that makes it okay for her to break your things. That doesn't make sense.

It's better to be safe than polite.

Abusers often look too good to be true. This is a trick to make you think that they're too good for you and that when the abuse starts you feel responsible for their sudden change in behavior.

What was your response to him right after he told you this? Did you laugh nervously or try to empathize with him. If you did you essentially gave him the green light to continue with behavior that could be frowned upon or make you uncomfortable.

I would have a serious conversation with him. Carefully watch his reaction when you tell him about how horrible you think it is that he killed an animal for that reason. He will likely try to convince you that he was justified or that your couldn't possibly understand how he felt. If you have a conversation like this with an abuser they will likely loose their shit because they think they are losing their control of you.

One of them is an angel reaching for the heavens with a broken chain around her ankle. ""What's that mean?"" I usually respond with something along the lines of how life can't keep me down. The really meaning is so much more.  For me it means that the Devil can't keep me down, that I'm not a monster, and that I'm capable of being the person I'm meant to be. A lot of my tattoos are about struggling with inner peace. I won't tell people that though. I'll give them some dumb cookie cutter answer for their cookie cutter world where everything fits.

It's harder with scars. I've never cut myself, but I have scars in certain areas from insignificant things and people always assume the worst. It makes me so mad because if those scars were from me harming myself would them knowing why they're there be any less rude or any of their business.

If you have another customer like that one who complained about you saying it isn't your business. I would go to your leadership. Tell them that it's a sensitive topic for you, and that you were very polite, but you should have to explain yourself to a customer.

Also respond with a ""Why is that your business?"" For Example:

Rando: What are those scars from?

Me: Why is that your business? 

Rando: Your display of your mental health issues makes me uncomfortable.

Me: How does that make it your business?

Rando: I don't believe that you're a capable employee, and I don't trust you to service me if you have mental health issues.

Me: I still fail to see how this is your business?

No matter what their answer is, it'll never be their business. Never. Your employer thinks that you are trust worthy enough to be a manager. I would ask them to support you in this.

Gas lighting is a typical tactic for abusive parents.

Start documenting everything you can. If she fights with you and tells you hurtful things that frequently start recording it whether it's video, or audio. Take picture as much as you can too.

Since she's also trying to shame you for eating start documenting what you eat (like a food journal only this will prove that your not eating that much). Document every time she complains about your weight and make sure that if you're doing a video/audio recording that you explain to her your medical condition (yes, she should already knows about it, but it shows you trying to settle things yourself).

Keep a journal too and start documenting every time she's verbally abusive in a journal. The more evidence that you have the better. Try to get CPS or some other kind of child protection agency just keep in mind that they will need evidence for anything to actually be done.

Is you mother taking her medication like she's supposed to? Someone with bipolar disorder should not be caring for a child if they are not taking their medication like they should be. Her going off her medication can cause extreme mood swings, mania, and worse. If you can prove that she isn't taking her medication that will get you and your sister out of there pretty fast.

Much of what you said is emotional abuse which is much harder to prove that physical abuse. It can be done, you just need to be incredibly thorough and persistent. If you think even for an instant that your mother could get violent with you get out of there. I would count the Zoloft thing as making you fear for you life. If she says/does anything that is remotely like a threat I would leave. If she's okay with letting your overdose on pills then imagine what she would be okay doing to you.

Prepare an emergency bag and hide it at a friend's house if you have to (with someone you trust or somewhere you know is safe). In this bag you'll want underwear, clothes, a toothbrush, toiletries, etc. That way if things do indeed get dangerous you can just leave without having to worry about packing last minute."

LetsNotMeet,fiqml7x,t3_f9babu,1582647523.0,"This whole thing is terrible unhealthy for both of you. I don't have any idea what she's doing, but normal people don't do that. Stay away from her. Make up any excuse you can, and document any form of communication you have with her. If she's this crazy then when she finds out that you don't want to be her friend anymore (which will happen eventually even if you are being nice about it) crazy people can go from normal to psycho like pushing a button.

I would start putting distance between you. Be nice about it at first. If she refuses to understand then gradually become more firm. Above all document all forms of communication. If you talk to her in person have someone else there to be a witness. Do not spend any alone time with her ever again. If you bump into her while you out shopping and stuff then make sure that you stay in a public location with lots of people until she leaves or someone comes to get you.

This makes me fear for your safety. Share all of this with the people you trust so they can help you out. I would make sure that you're alone as little as possible.

I think that she's incredibly codependent. When you're codependent its all about other people and never about yourself. Only she took it to the extreme. She is so dependent on you that she has used you as part of her self image. Sometimes people lie because they want attention, but this is so much more than that. Without you she wouldn't be who she is, I don't think she knows who she is anymore and she herself is slowly realizing that which is making her unstable. I'm not sure if this is making sense, but I'm not a psychologist.

You aren't pathetic. To be honest if I were in your situation, I would be convincing myself that I'm crazy or I'm obsessing over this too much. I had an emotionally abusive mother, and she was really good at gas-lighting me into believing that if I was a good girl then she wouldn't have to break her promises, use my pain against me, etc. She got a hold of you at a time in your life when you were weak. 

She's done a great job of manipulating you to this point. This isn't solely on you. No one wants to believe that some they trust is capable of this. She's a predator that's taken advantage of you. I'm sure if you did a little more digging you could find all kinds of things that she's been keeping from you.

I also suggest that you either stop using social media or become incredibly private on social media. If she's desperate she might pull any information she has on you and make it part of her. She's like an emotional amoeba. All the things that you tell her and trust her with she swallows and makes it part of herself. Don't give her anything else to work with."

When i woke up from these terrible nightmares it helped to know that he hadn't abandoned me. I really just didn't want to be alone when I was scared the most.

My Dad put a stop to it because he's friends at work said that it was weird and that it made them uncomfortable. I stopped because he told me to, but from then on the nightmares got worse and I started to have trouble sleeping. I never told my Dad because I didn't want him to think I was making up excuses, and because that might make the situation even more awkward. I coped with this by keeping the TV on to help me not feel alone. Even now I still sleep with the TV on mostly because it's a habit.

That doesn't seem to be what's going on here. You might need to not just have a serious conversation not just with your SO but with her daughter as well. 

It could also be a difference in how you were raised. I was raised in a house where being seen naked was a no no. You locked the door when you were on the toilet or taking a shower.

However, I have friends who walked around naked in their own house because it was just them and their mom. They were both girls. They would walk around naked or in their underwear totally unfazed. I would have been mortified if I saw my mom walking around naked or if I had been caught walking around naked.

ChoosingBeggars,fhb1wuk,t1_fhazdtj,1581432908.0,"I have posted about it before.

Essentially my husband's parents have always treated him badly. They make fun of this dreams, the things he likes, how we spend our money, etc. Well we came to them for help around summer time last year, but they decided not only to not help us but to treat us like we were children for asking for help in the first place.

After that we decided to limit contact. We blocked them only on social media. They called us a month later demanding to know why. We told them why very politely and calmly. They freaked out and demanded that we unblock them. They told my husband that they were his parents and he owed them for taking care of him his whole life. After trying to be logical and reasonable with them they hung up on us.

They called and texted more than fifteen times in one hour that night. We were forced to block their phone numbers simply to sleep. They proceeded to send emails.

My husband and I are both in the military so they tried to get our leadership involved. Which leadership isn't going to make us talk to anyone if we don't want to. They don't care about what we do as long as it isn't illegal and doesn't effect our job. We had to contact our leadership and explain the situation to them. They then threatened to force their way onto our base to speak with whoever they had to speak with.

We had to file a statement with Security Forces (the Air Force's police) because we were afraid for our safety. We also thought that if they were crazy enough to try to force their way on base we should give them a heads up.

For a couple weeks things calmed down. Until they figured out how to scramble their number so call us. They sent a letter with a half-hearted apology, but they didn't really apologize at all through the whole letter. They tricked my husband into talking with them. I guess they thought that manipulating my husband so they could give another pathetic apology was totally okay, and that doing it again because they've been doing it is whole life would surely fix things now.

We had to change our numbers. They unfortunately know our address so they still sent us Christmas presents which we donated. They also managed to get a hold of my husband's new phone number which we'll be changing again after he gets home from deployment.

Around Christmas they tried to make my Dad 'put me in line'. The thing is my Dad knew everything about what happened. I showed him the proof that my husband and I collected so he knew exactly what was going on.

They also made me out to be this terrible monster that corrupted their son. The thing is I'm the one who saw how badly they hurt him with their emotional abuse pretty much right after my husband and I got together. At first I wanted to believe that I was misunderstanding things, but it only got worse as time went on. They were always incredibly controlling of their adult son. I think that they just hated losing control of their victim.

We did try to file for a protective order, but since they hadn't threatened us in writing we were told that it wouldn't work. We're holding on to everything.

The night they blew up on us they said horrible things about both me and my husband. The kind of horrible things that you can't just take back, especially not without a real apology. ""I'm sorry that it hurt your feelings."" Is what they've essentially said over and over. They have yet to admit exactly what they've done, and they've been telling all kinds of lies to my husband's side of the family.

The moral of the story is that it doesn't take much to set off crazy. Also don't accept a fake apology."
ChoosingBeggars,fhawrkr,t3_f21psi,1581429176.0,"This reminds me of a post. I can't remember if it was on the subreddit or not.

It was about this photographer who was being pressured into taking the pictures of a friend of a friend's wedding. When the the bride refused to want to pay the full price (I think she wanted a huge discount or it to be done free because they're friends) the photographer said they wouldn't do it because they wouldn't be making any money. The bride's family started reaching out to the photographer to pressure them into doing the wedding. The photographer responded with a sarcastic reply something along the lines of, 'sure, I'll do it' with an implied eye roll.

Finally the photographer gets left alone, but they clearly had no intention of doing the wedding. Anyone with half a brain would have figured that out from the messages the photographer sent. Come the day of the wedding, the photographer clearly wasn't there. Her phone started blowing up with threats to their safety.

Apparently the bride's father came to the photographers house to force them to go to the wedding and take pictures or worse (people are crazy). He was banging on the door and yelling obscenities for two hours. I can't remember if the photographer was actually home or not.

Well the threats continued along with strange people banging on their door so they had to call the police. They had held onto all of the messages from the bride's family including the ones with the threats. The bride and her father were arrested for harassment. I'm pretty sure that the photographer did end up pressing charges.

I also wouldn't take it personally which is easier said than done, but sometimes people yell at you because you're the first one they encounter.

Just try to stay composed. Help if you can, but if there's nothing you can do then explain that to them.

I would reflect on it a bit, and think about exactly what it is you want their relationship to be. What are the pros and cons of the way the relationship currently is?

I've had a SIL come to me and tell me that I wasn't allowed to post pictures about my nephew. Did it suck a little? Yes, but I wasn't angry. I only ever want the best for my nephew and his mother was trying to do what's best. That means I wait to get pictures when I visit, and I keep them just for me.

When ever I have kids I plan on doing something similar. I expect you to be around for my child to be part of their life. There are people I already know that my future children will never get to see, simply because of how they treated me and my husband. I don't plan on posting pictures of them on Facebook.

This way your mom can't call 911 saying that you're being kidnapped or something. If the police are already there and already know the situation your mom can't twist things.

Since you Mom is so adamant that you shouldn't leave. I would prepare a to go bag in case things get dangerous. When abusers realize that they are losing control they snap, and that could put you in serious danger. Keep a back pack with clothes and stuff hidden away in case you start to feel unsafe and like you need immediately.

I would also start documenting everything. Start packing things. Do you have a place that you could store things at temporarily? Like a friend's house or something? If you do you could take things here and there to your friends house until you have nothing left. Then you can move in with your BF and his family because you have nothing at her house anymore and she can't stop you.

I think you best option would be asking to police to help you move, and have your boyfriend come down. If you schedule everything right the police will get there, then your boyfriend will get there then you can move.

When they realized how suspicious they might appear, probably shout something along the lines of, ""Hello, I don't mean to startle you, but I need x, y, and z."" At least that's what I would do if I ever had to do that.

Especially, if you live in a remotely rural area. I mean most people who live in the country have guns. If I was so desperate that I was knocking on a door in the middle of the night, I would do everything I could to not get shot. I won't need to find a place to stay if I'm dead."
tifu,fgfmy0o,t1_fgfmmft,1580742952.0,Well I'm a girl in my mid twenties and most of the time they make it seem like girls do this tiny cute little shriek in horror movie in stuff. That's not the kind of scream you make when you're really afraid. When you're really afraid you scream so high and loud that you hurt your own ears.
tifu,fgfku51,t3_exxaun,1580741449.0,"This is why I'm not allowed to watch horror movies at home. I'm scared far too easily, and I will scream. I mean a bloody murder kind of scream not like a cute little shriek."

I was raised in a pretty messed up home. I always tried to tell people about how abusive my older brother was, but I was too young to properly explain what was happening so everyone thought I was lying or exaggerating the details. He almost killed me, and even then I still didn't think anyone would believe me

You are old enough to explain things to people. I wouldn't want to continue a relationship with your parents at all. They don't care about how you feel, and are allowing your brother to do this to you. I would be so hurt and angry. 

Look out for yourself. Your parents should put your well being first, and should protect you. However, it's clear that they have no intention of doing that. That might sound harsh, but it's true. They have let this go on for years and all they did was have him stop picking you up, but only because you almost had a car crash which probably would have revealed the situation that you're in. I think it's time that you start doing what's best for you. Now that might mean turning your back on your family, or them turning their back on you for blowing the whistle. That doesn't make it wrong. You need to look out for yourself. There will be times when the only one who can do what's best for you is you. It won't be easy, and people won't always understand, but doing the right thing isn't easy most of the time.

This might not be entirely helpful, but I hope it helps you think about things differently."

EntitledPeople,fg4oif1,t3_ewsxn2,1580507607.0,"For what it's worth I recently had a grandpa that I hadn't seen since I was like five tell me that I needed to grow my hair out because I look like a dike. My response was, ""Why does that matter? I like my hair short, it's a lot less work."" The funny thing is for that whole weekend I was toned down. God forbid he see me in my real make up. I usually go for a punk/rocker sort of look so that means my hair is sort of combed, I have colorful eyeliner, and dark lipstick.

I'm sorry that this happened to you. Just be yourself, you deserve to be happy like anybody else."
relationship_advice,fg4l73f,t1_fg4ao6u,1580505573.0,"You made the right choice. He did this deliberately. I would start ignoring him entirely if you have to. Good relationships are built honest communication. It wasn't even your cooking that was the problem (I suck at cooking and have to working really hard to make anything edible) he said himself that he just didn't want to be healthy. He's too lazy to take initiative so he's putting the blame on you.

This isn't even really about the food. He lied to you over and over again for a year. He lied to you over something so small that it could have easily been sorted out with a discussion. He let people mock you, and didn't stand up for you. He has no respect for you or the work that you put into the relationship. He doesn't really care about you, or take you seriously."
