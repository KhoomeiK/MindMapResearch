I love those kinds of videos, the delivery of their jokes and hand drawings always make me laugh out loud. Exurb1a and bill wurtz are also really great although not that similar."

I spend many nights on my uncle computer playing along with my cousins, at the time it was the scariest thing in the world to play it with the lights off. I believe we got the secret locations from a magazine and still, we could never finish it"
2meirl4meirl,eweb7sm,t3_cno8en,1565319113.0,"The other night I was thinking about how much I miss to hug my mum. I do it every time I see her but I wish I could have one of those big bear hugs or a longer hug.

when I was little, I used to get sad and sometimes she would wrap a blanket around both of us telling me that everything would be fine, that I should let it out, that crying was okay.

I'm almost 21 and I don't think I'm capable of crying anymore, I just stare at the wall felling overwhelming upset and yet too numb to have an emotional response.

as time went by, I understood that sadness is annoying, I learned to stay silent to save everyone else's comfort."
