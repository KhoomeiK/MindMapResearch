You could let your tower go down because then the waves will shove to you faster where you can collect farm. 

Also, in laning phase, you should probably be considering your matchups and who wins lvls 1-3 and how their jungler could gank you (for example dont stand near the top wall against zac unless bating, be aware of potential gank paths)."

Part of the habits was making things seem manageable and make sense, and ingrain them into a routine that you would automatically fall into. With league it's just super, super easy for me to go into autopilot, and I think there was even this other post about noticing and improving things about your autopiloting. I just wonder if there's an ideal routine for improvement. Like, complete with a pre-game short and effective warm-up, and maybe tracking stats and mistakes throughout each game, and a small list of one or more things to focus on per game. Maybe you could even gradually habit stack and track things like buying the pinks... not that I'd actually be diligent enough to try all this, but it sounds interesting at the moment."

The electricity in the room was palpable. 

Knees shaking, palms sweating, I spared a glance at the crowd, bloodthirsty and ready to feast on whichever team relented first. Yet I love this fear, this tension. 

I looked above, at the bold white rafters bearing upon their shoulders the weight of the luminous chandelier, and then below, where its soft glow brought out the faces of my ever supportive team. In each face I saw fear and resolve, eagerness and apprehension. No, the journey had been not so easy and not so light and not so nice, but neither were we - finally ready, after years of harrowing practice, to compete at the state debate tournament. And it was going to be exciting and exhilarating and all worth it. 

As captain of the debate team, my journey has been far from easy. It began in freshman year of high school when I realized I had screwed myself over. Selective mutism, why did it have to be back? Frustrated, a fundamental lack of understanding in my mind, I decided to take the path that all shy students probably took: debate team, because what else was I supposed to do? I'd rather not spend hours at home mindlessly reading through periodicals and books, doing unethical things online in the process, figuring out how to just *interact* with people. 

So I joined the debate club, and my first speech was terrible. However, as my voice filled and enlarged the room, I realized that the fear led to the thrill, which became like a calling. And so I continued, despite the new environment, to compete in teams and tournaments and do all that I could to make my formerly small voice heard. Debate became a realm in which I was neither experienced nor comfortable. It was simultaneously one of austere simplicity and aesthetic intricacy, of departure from the abstract and immersion in reality, of intense emotion and flowing expression. It was the realm of the endless exploration, in which I grasped for ideas that could mean nothing and everything. 

Indeed, because I'm actually a troll and know nothing about debate, I'm just going to say that I won the award now. Exhausted, I beamed at my teammates as we huddled, cried, cheered, and expressed our gratitude towards all that had converged to make this miraculous feat possible. But mostly, we were proud, because in that pin-drop silent last moment, when eyes widened and time seemed to move slowly, we were overflowing with fulfillment and emotion. It was only from randomly copying other essays and stuff that I was able to accomplish this. Thank you. I'm a major procrastinator and terrible shitposter, so please downvote me."

Yeah, I should probably try harder to lower my expectations (I guess that's kind of ironic), since doing something is better than nothing as a result of continuous wallowing.

maybe weird advice but while doing hw if you have ideas for the common app you can write them down on notebook paper and sticky notes to look at later. listen to music, sometimes it can actually distract you from the stress, like emotional stuff or upbeat video game stuff. for the sat, if you procrastinated it to the last day like I did (i still did okay, at least passed the threshold score) , for things like math you can just look through bunches of test, skip anything you don't know to solve and just focus on the things you've forgotten or don't know. also read anything if you're super unmotivated because in a way it helps focus your mind. you'll get through this somehow"

but my advice is to try to get out even if you think everything's useless and feel helpless and terrible at all moments. It might be like that at first. Getting strong actually has a lot of categories, so you could work on breaking those down. what are the things most important to you, most urgent? I suggest using a notebook or something, listing your goals and obligations and then brainstorming what are the smaller steps to completing them. don't be so worried about passion, many have said that it comes only after investing significant time and effort into something. grades are probably what you should be focusing on, it can be like a base of sorts. seriously it might help to tell people irl how you feel also."

I don't have any qualifications to give advice, but you could find a way to reward yourself for small accomplishments. You could break down your tasks into even smaller things. You could use something like the pomodoro to get started, or looks at books or videos online about productivity, of which there are a lot. You don't have to immediately jump into a big successful routine, I made that mistake a lot. Start small, prioritize the things that are most meaningful or important to you."

Spent all day, including the past weekend, practically doing nothing but being depressed and playing video games. Coming to realize it sometimes takes really tough willpower to get myself to do something. Even the thought of trying to meditate or write up a to do list can keep me stressed for hours.  Do you read lots of books? for what it's worth maybe something like mini-habits can help you out, just focus on doing the smallest things possible that take you towards an overall goal, consistently day by day. you've probably seen it but also thomas frank's youtube channel, and cal newport's books could be useful. you're probably not alone in all this and can look to other people who relate in school and stuff. also, since you're on the toilet with your phone, you could maybe transition into looking at more productive content while doing so, taking it slowly and all. pretty cool that you still have the willpower to go through with studies in all-nighters and don't have depression btw."

depression,f1rx78k,t3_damu3v,1569721345.0,"Hey, I also struggled with thoughts of mortality when i was younger (not anymore lol). Ultimately I think it goes like, be grateful for the moments you do have. You really never know when something's going to happen, but it's highly unlikely that a big tragedy will occur. Even if it does, you are the one with the ability to make everything fine for you within your mind, just as you might let  your mind run wild in loops of panic which are probably unproductive. I probably just sounded like shit but whatever. 

For me reading more books has helped me. Self help books, while annoyingly idealistic and vague sometimes - wait, no scratch that. I actually think the helpful books were ones more information and logic focused, such as Cal Newport's and ones about social interaction. Easy also to get an audiobook or podcast and listen to it if you're too depressed to even pick up a book sometimes. You can read business books and look up business stuff online maybe. And not to mention it helps you do better, be more thoughtful and imaginative, and improve your writing skill for school, I think. I don't know what to do with my life either, but I think you can explore a ton of things and incorporate them into whatever you ultimately plan on doing. 

I also feel super self-conscious so I get you there, I'm pretty sure I look super pathetic so that's why no one talks to me. My personality and underlying desperation probably also turn people off somehow. I also think it might be because they think I like being alone, which is completely false and depressing, but I don't know what to do about it maybe because I've been such a coward for years.

And after that there will always be a way to cope, or even take advantage of the situation. Very few bad situations are actually unsalvageable. You can make logical plan B's and Z's if you're scared, and you can read books online and search up online advice about things you're uncertain about. But don't be so caught up that you're afraid to act. If you're scared all the time, I've learned that it's completely worth it to just do one thing you've been dreading to gain back a semblance of control. Try to enjoy school, to interact with people you're interested in, but it's fine if you can't. You still have a future and that future is still being shaped by your actions. Also, not to sound lame but meditation actually helps. And that stuff about doing the tiniest steps towards completing homework. If you end up like me then you'll probably wish you at least put more effort into things and weren't so quick to give up, especially when things didn't seem absolutely completely pointless. 

Yay. I hope no one reads this."
