I had friends before but lost touch over the years and settled down.

Relationship broke down, no friends and chronic pain to deal with.

I'm not sure if my sadness and lonely Ness is down to having no friends. Or if I truly desire to have friends, I seem to remember even when I had a social group that I felt alone.

I'm starting to think it's a mental thing, somethimg unbalanced as I've always felt like I'm not the same as everyone else. Somethings missing but never known what.

How are you doing today?"
depression,f9vg4j0,t1_f876uvp,1575669705.0,"Know this feeling all too well.

Years ago I had a social circle. Somehow during a long term relationship I lost touch. The years rolled on and relationship broke down.

I'm in a circle of wanting to be alone, loneliness sets in, desire to socialise sets in but have no one to socialise woth. The odd time I do have to be around people outside of work cripling anxiety sets in, somehow feel bloated (stress?) and an overwhelming desire to get away and be alone creeps in.

Any advise how to move forward? I'd love to have a long term best friend of partner. The type where you've know each other years and feel comfortable but no idea how to get there.

I'm fine forming friendships when I have to be with people ie at work but struggle with friendships outside of this. How to ask someone to do something, even when I do I often cancel after getting massive anxiety."
depression,f9ve5hq,t3_e60j8s,1575668409.0,"I know the feeling of feeling empty and lonely inside despite holding down a job and having company at work. It's that deep down longing to have a really close friend/partner that's missing, happy Ness missing, feeling a failure in life and a feeling that your going through an impossible struggle.

I feel like I'm struggling every day, a huge struggle that I get through and gain a sense of achievement that I've got through it, I can see how people don't manage too in these tim3s and wonder what it must feel like to be a normal person.

Hows your day been. I hope there's been a good part of the day no matter how small it's something."
depression,f9vbtkg,t1_f6r3fay,1575666906.0,"Alot of this rings true for myself.

Can't fall asleep so stay up late I till I fall asleep still sat up or with the TV on, only to wake up feeling like I could carry on sleeping all day, to drag my tired self though the day ready for the same again come nigjt time.

Im abit older than yourself, 35, have always managed to get on with people at school, work mates and generally people I have to be around (school, college work ect) but find it stressful and difficult trying to form friendships outside of these.

My father sounds similar to yours, never shows emotion and is a loner himself so maybe it runs in the family. I have a cousin with aspbergers so maybe that runs in the family.

Not sure why I'm telling you the above, just found myself searching reddit for depression out of dispair. Read your post and could relate to alot or it.

Ive felt the same as how you describe for as long as I can remember. Hope you find some peace, sleep and happynes however small"
