Basically 5s are more selfish about keeping peace (basically they do it for personal reasons, or because upsetting the balance would cause issues for them) while 9s are keeping peace because they're afraid of causing discourse (basically they're worried they might upset someone or that someone might become upset with them)."

One dude sat down at my table and continously talked to me even though I kept telling him (well writing it down) to go away.

Enneagram,fm8rj8n,t1_fm8i7bs,1585854678.0,"I think an unhealthy 5 can mirror a normal 9 in that way. I have a friend who is a 9. He's very soft spoken and doesn't like to cause trouble. He's also very good at dispelling arguments and rarely ever gets mad, but almost every other emotion is fair game even if he doesn't always express them. If he does then he usually sticks to himself and apologizes after calming down even if it wasn't his fault. That's a more normal day for him.

For me, I tend to not get emotional and try to think things through before getting upset. I stick to myself and I am very self sufficient, way more than my friend. I always tell him he can rely on me to help with things and I can teach him skills to be more self sufficient and such. In typical 9 fashion he denys so as not to be too much of a burden on me. But that's a normal me: mostly just reserved and independent, nothing to drastic.

In moments of high stress, I'm much worse than my friend. I stop eating and talking to people all together. I won't say a word even if I have to. I'll just write on a board. I'll send my friends reassuring texts even if I'm on a verge of panic attack because I don't want to make my problems someone else's burden. It feels like if I can't get through this on my own then there's something wrong with me. Or I think that if I get anyone else involved it'll just be more trouble than it actually is worth. I went months without speaking and barely eating during my junior year of highschool. I had two panic attacks that I made sure got swept under the rug and even had two low blood sugar reaction from not eating (one sent me to the hospital, the other I guess wasn't that severe or something). This entire time I told no one. My parent's only ever knew about the time I damn near passed *because* I went to the hospital. 

My point is, 5s like to be self reliant. We think our problems are burdens to others so we'd rather deal with them ourselves without involving other especially if we are stressed. I think 9s are more centered around not wanting to cause trouble. From what I've seen with my 9 friend, he doesn't seek to find solutions to his issues on his own, he just simply doesn't bring them up. With me (a 5) on the other hand, I try to find solutions on my own and fix my own problems without involving anyone else."

I would get picked out the crowd, talked to, or put on a pedestal of percieved ""excellence"" wherever I went and it just fed into my self deprecating and unhealthy cycle of pretending I didn't need anything because ""great people"" didn't have problems. Problems are for normal people and as far as I had been told, I wasn't normal, I was great so I thought I wasn't allowed to have problems. 

You'd think getting so much praise growing up would inflate my ego, but it kind of did the opposite."
intj,flt28wz,t3_fquoua,1585457088.0,"For me, it just puts me into a more calm and happy state of mind. I'm typically very sad, angry, or stressed/anxious, although I suppress those emotions. Being high mellows me out and makes me more open. For example, I'm typically not into physical affection and loathe being touched, but when I'm high I tend to be more physically affectionate."

intj,flpealk,t1_flpcdq6,1585357470.0,"I wouldn't initiate a hug, but that's because I have a lot of personal issues with touch. I'll give you a hug if you ask for one, but I won't ask for a hug. Plus, I'm more of a ""I baked you cookies cuz you were sad, and I heard you needed help with this so I learned how to do it so I can help you"" kind of person when it comes to showing affection."
intj,flp8jzm,t3_fpx2wo,1585353878.0,"I cannot speak for any other INTJs, but personally I absolutely loathe being touched or having my personal space invaded. So much so that if my personal space is violated too much or I'm touched when I don't want to be it can trigger my anxiety and even send me into a panic attack. Touch and being in one's space is super intimate for me. Friends and SOs, though can get hugs whenever they want."
introvert,flp25s3,t3_fpu5dy,1585350148.0,"I do this a lot, but I only keep a select few people that I consider close friends and I text often. After getting close to them I explain to them that I just randomly self isolate, usually for unexplainable reasons. I tell them that I'll just fall into spells of wanting to self isolate and not speak (I also repeatedly go through spells of becoming selectively mute) and they understand and respect this. So if I don't speak for a few days or weeks, or don't text as often or not at all they know why and don't go crazy."
Enneagram,fljh3ts,t3_fooxsh,1585212291.0,I love Assassination Classroom so much and it's in my top 10 of anime worlds I want to be in. I just wanted to be Karma and have a teacher like Korosensei and maybe learn a little mixed martial arts and some sick knife tricks? Yeah? Yeah? Please?
intj,fljg8a9,t1_flj5gap,1585211210.0,"The only reason I can see why people would even think INTJs are cold is because we can tend to be more selective in who we open up to. Like, I'm a kind person, but I'm not very open or quick to expel energy for others just because. Then I'm also pretty quiet on top of that. A lot of people have told I'm mean or cold because of this. My friends, however, describe me as nice, helpful, compassionate, etc. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'm pretty sure most INTJs are nice and affectionate people, we just aren't openly like that with *everyone.* We do care and are kind, but we tend to keep our emotions to ourselves because we either have our walls up or find it unnecessary to share them with any and everyone just for the sake of doing so.

Everything INTJs do tend to have some purpose. It's intentional. If you're careful about the words or emotions you express people will think they don't exist. It's not that INTJs lack emotion, it's just that we take into account if the situation causes for or is optimal to express certain emotions. That or we simply are still taking time to process and understand our emotions so they don't get expressed right away.

To sum it up: INTJs are just as emotional and affection as the next person. We just choose when and with whom we express them."
introvert,fljfb5r,t3_fp01cu,1585210082.0,"In these times I get that it's rough, but I remember being told that I just needed to ""learn to be social"" cuz that's how the world was and now that things have changed I'm bogus for telling extroverts that keep complaining about not going out to just ""pick up a solo hobby."""
introvert,fljf60c,t1_flj71td,1585209910.0,"Yeah. Since the quarantine there's been a lot of people getting sad about being indoors so much, which they have right too. But it seems that the people who don't have an issue with it are being guilt tripped into trying super hard to show others how to be more comfortable handling the isolation, which honestly feels like a slap to the face since introverts seem to always get told they just need to change to fit the environment. There's just a lot of ""are you introverted, here's how to not be"" things and there was never much for showing extroverts how to handle introverts. Now that life is more in favor of introverts than extroverts, introverts are still being told they need to change and do something to cater to extroverts. Not saying I wouldn't check on my extroverted friend, but it wouldn't be because they're an extrovert it'd be because they're a friend."
AskWomen,fljd9bj,t3_fp2x0y,1585207641.0,"Beauty standards, being sexualized, and being told ""you act like a boy"" by other girls just because you like sports or something stupid like that. Ugh and so many other things, but those have to be top three."

intj,flfnb3c,t1_flfk8wp,1585111325.0,Too much? My reasonings probably made me sound kinda bitchy.
intj,flecuoh,t3_fo4bq1,1585081930.0,"#1 was Quality Time. Since I tend to be very selective of who I'm around, I value quality time over most other things. I don't enjoy everyone's company or I'm not able to stand being around any types of people for too long. When I find people who I can hang out with for long periods of time it is very comforting. Also spending time with people allows me to grow closer to them emotionally. If I can't be around you for long, it is likely I will talk to you less and therefore it will be hard for me to become attached to you emotionally.

#2 was Acts of Service. This one is also how I personally try to show others I care for them and is also pretty important to me. I like when people give me advice or helpful links when I'm going through something. I enjoy when people do things for me because it is thoughtful and helpful. While I'm not the type of person to police how others do things, just doing random things unnecessarily or that prove to be no help or are actually nuisances can be a bit irritating which is why I don't always want to ask for help. But if the person knows me and does something that is genuinely helpful for me it does feel very nice because it feels like my way of doing things is understood, respected, and even emulated.

#3 was Physical Touch. I actually absolutely despise all forms of physical touch outside of a select few people that I can count on one hand. Being touched, no matter how casual, is a very intimate thing for me. Even so much as a handshake can feel intrusive for me. While I don't bitch at people for tapping my shoulder or such, it still makes me feel uncomfortable and I just get through life by wearing clothes that keep me covered so I at least don't have to have any skin to skin contact with most people. I have yet to explore the possibilities of me liking or craving physical affection from those I care for, simply because growing up I was forced to share physical affection and intimacy when I didn't want to and has made me mostly indifferent to it at the best and as mentioned before completely disgusted by it at worst. I have a good friend though that very much enjoys hugs that I can discuss and explore these things with.

#4 was Words of Affirmation. I was brought up to be fiercely independent and tend to be a ""you know without me having to say it"" type of person when it comes to expressing how I feel, especially feelings of affection. I also tend to beat myself up about stuff sometimes, so it can be pretty nice to hear someone tell me I did a good job without any added ""but next time you should..."" Hearing people say they care for me can be very reassuring during moments of high stress or panic or sometimes when I just haven't heard it in a while. It can help me feel more seen and serve as a gentle reminder that there are people who care for me if I ever start forgetting.

#5 was Recieving Gifts. This one was honestly a complete no go for me. I do not like recieving gifts for a few reasons. The first is because I do not want to accidentally be rude. I know myself and I know for a fact that if I'm given a gift (no matter how nice or in line with my tastes that it is) and I feel like it unnecessary I will say as such. Being given things at random when I do not want them doesn't make me feel loved as it just makes me wonder about where I'd put the thing or about it taking up space, which is not an attitude you should have while receiving a gift. The second is because people tend to not always get something you would truly appreciate or just a repeat of something you have. I don't want to deal with that type of hassle so I'd rather avoid gift giving all together. Thirdly, it feels either too shallow or too emotionally burdensome. Buying me material things doesn't make me happy, but giving me something you hold in great value makes me feel uneasy because I will feel like I shattered your dreams or emotions if something were to happen to it. For example a knife was given to me by a friend in order help protect myself since I had a long and dangerous commute to and from school (highschool). I had a low blood sugar reaction (not diabetic, I just had not been eating due to being stressed and had a panic attack earlier that week) and the knife fell out of my bag. The entire situation was a little upsetting, but they confiscated the knife and suspended me for a few days because it was a grade 3 weapon. I'd never used it on anyone or pulled it out it in school and didn't have any history of being a threat, but they still turned the knife in to the police and I couldn't get it back. The knife belonged to my friend's grandfather who had died recently. I felt so horrible because I felt like I lost my friend's valuable item that reminded him of his grandfather. It sat on me heavy emotionally, which didn't help when I was already so stressed out. For reason like that I tend to steer clear of gift giving. If that is your love language (like it is for my friend who gave me the knife) I'd rather I come with you to pick it out or you give me something that easily adaptable like money, a gift card, maybe a mug. I'm not knocking people who's love language is gift giving, but it's definitely not for me."
intj,fle6r47,t3_fob96w,1585078642.0,"Being organized is *not* a trait shared across all INTJs. I identify as an INTJ as the cognitive functions best match me, but I'm not that organized. While I can tend to keep things tidy I get kind of extreme where either everything has to be perfect in order all the time or it's absolute chaos, especially if I'm in the middle of working on something. Papers everywhere, and my thoughts scattered as I'm thinking about all the different ways things can turn out. So don't get discouraged because the descriptions say INTJs need to be organized. I find a better description to be that we are just efficient. Sometimes efficiency is not organized, but a little chaotic. The point is the results and not the process anyhow. I hope that helped."

I like good debates and trying to understand different perspectives, but if met with facts and rationale and you actively choose to ignore or aren't willing to adapt and see things from other perspectives I have no respect for you or your opinion. It wasn't built in truth, fact, research and personal values, but in emotions fueled by a lack of understanding, which is something I just cannot respect."
