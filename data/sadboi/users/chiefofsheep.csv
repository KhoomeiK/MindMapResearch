In your title, you said “I need her,” and well, that’s not true. You’re in a lot of pain. I don’t discount that. But breakups are survivable events. There’s a fair chance that you’ll eventually fall in love with someone else, and be more in love with them than the person you currently have in mind. Relationships require grief, similar to death. Heartaches can feel like you’re dying, but that doesn’t make it so. It is within your power to move on, but only if you want to. You will smile again one day."

helpmecope,exx8ydf,t3_cu9vij,1566632226.0,"I feel your pain. The first necessity is getting yourself to therapy. If you can, find a trauma specialized therapist. Look for support groups for victims of abuse. Intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization programs can help as well.

Remember this. You are not a bad person. You didn’t choose what happened to you. You are not at fault. You didn’t know how to defend yourself; most people wouldn’t if they went through that. But you can learn. 

I suffered a different kind of abuse, and when my abuser could no longer hurt me, she began hurting herself. My point is the people who hurt you didn’t do so because they think you’re bad, they did it because they have feelings inside of them that they let loose on you. They were irresponsible; you were in the wrong place at the wrong time. That doesn’t make you wrong. 

All the individual can do is be responsible for the individual. You now have the option to seek treatment and heal.
