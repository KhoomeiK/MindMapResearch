This is just the tip of the iceberg. It goes deeper. If you care about this issue, you should read up more about it. 

Again, Israel’s force wasn’t bigger. It was smaller or comparable in size. The Israelis weren’t more numerous as you claim. The Arab armies didn’t throw everything they had. Israel threw everything they had. 
Why? Going back to your first point- it was an existential fight. Not only because Israel suffered high casualties. Egypt, Syria and others have lost a negligible amount of people to the war. Israel lost one percent of its population, in 9 months. That’s a lot. That’s about the same as Russia lost in the first 9 months of the war, I assume, maybe a little more maybe a little less. 
America actually lost 0.3% of its population. I was wrong earlier. I just looked it up. Britain lost 1%. Churchill and Britons viewed WW2 as an existential crisis. Remember, WW2 lasted six years for Britain. Israel’s independence war lasted only 9 months. 
These were pretty high figures. 
But it wasn’t just the casualties. Israel avoided heavier casualties by winning the war relatively swiftly. The main reason it was existential is because Israel’s physical existence was at stake. England, had it been conquered by Nazi Germany, would’ve been occupied country but its people would the same fate as French and Dutch. Occupied but alive. The Arabs didn’t plan an occupation of Israel, if you listen to their rhetoric from that period."

IsraelPalestine,fqq8mze,t3_gkbvgg,1589561271.0,"I generally agree, but I am undecided. Annexation will not give any extra benefit to Israel but it may have negative political consequences. The towns and areas that supposed to be annexed are already under Israeli control. It isn’t similar to other countries like Russia that annexed Crimea only after Ukraine signaled that Russia was standing to lose control of Crimea, in the aftermath of the 2014 elections. With that said, I think Israel and the Palestinians should agree on not expelling the settlers since they live there and it’s their land now. One important way of defining land ownership is by seeing who keeps the land. Even Karl Marx said that. “The fruit of your labor should be yours to keep”. Settlers in the Jordan valley are farmers, toiling the land."

1. That sounds like circular reasoning to me. Regardless of the name of the fallacy, I don’t think it addressed my point. Your claim that society never proved itself capable in regulating itself to shun evil men or to prevent evil people from gaining power is false or irrelevant because in anarchism there will be no evil men. Why? Because society will self regulate. 

2. Evil appears to be conducted on a mass scale today these days the most are carried out by people who have no respect to law and government. Often these people are very poor. Irregular militias like ISIS and the hundreds of of irregular, decentralized armies throughout Africa and the Middle East. Sub Saharan Africa, Syria and Yemen are out of sight out of mind. But they are real and they have no government. They have resources. Usually they steal those resources. 

3. Before Stalin had power he was a terrorist. He wasn’t born leader of the Soviet Union. He had to murder and torture tens of thousands of people to get to a place where he did have a comfortable life, as you say. Prior to that he was a poor peasant boy with an alcoholic father and a mother who couldn’t raise him. Not that it matters. There were millions of poor Russian boys with drunk, violent fathers and mothers that couldn’t raise them. Most did not end up terrorizing millions. The same is true for Genghis Khan. He was born a poor shepherd boy in lawless Mongolia. He died a wealthy man ruling over the largest empire in the world. Far from shunning him, his ruthlessness and power commanded the respect of his peers. How can you be sure that in a hypothetical anarchist society, there won’t be another Genghis khan, Stalin, Hitler or bin Ladin, who gain a following and murder people?"
IsraelPalestine,fqpkkxf,t3_gk65nw,1589548579.0,"The majority fled due to war. Some did flee because of Arab leaders recommendations or orders. Some fled due to expulsions. And Israel does not deny that there existed Arab refugees nor that some were expelled. The question is why does it matter today, and why can’t the losing side move on and make this a negotiation sticking point and their basis for uncompromising hatred of Israel? 

Population exchanges were the norm in the wars of the first half of the 20th century. Usually it was caused by the establishment of new nation states in the wake of bloody conflict, like WW2, Greek-Turkish wars (from the late 19th century up until the late 70s), Holland, Poland, Russia, and many other countries. 
India and Pakistan had a refugee issue ten times the scale of the Israeli Arab refugee issue. Over 15 million Muslim and Hindi Indians were displaced. These issues resurfaced in the post communist wars (Chechen, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Yugoslavia). 

The demographic makeup of most countries today is completely different than what it was in early 20th century. Kaliningrad, Russia was a German-Polish city before WW2. Today it’s a Russian city (geographically detached from Russia, as in territorially discontinuous, which Palestinians say is a bad thing, a crime against humanity!!) 
That fact doesn’t mean the whole world is stuck in a conflict unable to move on. Germany doesn’t have a claim over Kaliningrad, and doesn’t call for the return of ethnic Germans to that area."

IsraelPalestine,fqlpa27,t3_g8ytxv,1589463423.0,"It’s really impossible to know. Israel can annex parts of the West Bank very soon. Such a move may be opposed by some of Israel’s allies, but opposition to annexations or secession by outside powers (no matter how powerful) have limited to no impact. Northern Cyprus seceded from Greek Cyprus and became a de facto part of Turkey. There’s no end in sight. While the EU is calling for Turkish civilians born in Cyprus to be expelled from the islands (which is against international law and precedent), Turkey is still one of the most powerful countries in the Mediterranean. Russian annexed Crimea. While there was significant backlash against that, there is also a lot of skepticism that sanctions against Russia are necessary. The U.S. has a restrictive sanctions regime, but Europe (especially France and Germany) have much less restrictive sanctions and they continue trading with Russia because they rely on Russian gas and oil. Russia just finished building a gas pipe to Denmark and Germany. China annexed Tibet and violates every possible human right there and elsewhere. Europeans and American leftists are extremely sensitive about any calls to punish China. They would go as far as to call you a racist or a war monger if you support the type of policies radical leftists support against Israel. 
So you can see the limitations on the Palestinian strategy to “isolate” Israel and use international pressure. 
Ultimately, the future of the region lays in Palestinians’ ability to compromise with Israel and reach a practical solution that will be accepted to Israel, which is very possible. However, it would require Palestinians’ to give up on immaterial things they feel very strongly about. However, if they do so, they will see huge economic growth and the lives of everyday people would be better."
IsraelPalestine,fqlfwee,t1_fqk9o7d,1589456957.0,"The Soviet Union aided the Arabs much . The Arabs never become communists and never showed enthusiasm towards Russia.

They never let Russia control them because they weren’t Russian or communists. They welcomed Nasser and let Nasser take control (Nasser established the PLO) because they were all Arab, which was the primary identity. Palestinian nationalism did not exist in the 1920-67 because there was no Palestinian nation in this region which the British arbitrarily separated into states which never accepted that partition (to this day actually).

“There is no Palestinian nation. It’s a colonial invention.”

And for a few decades afterwards they sought to create a pan Arab state, which was a failure because of personal and regional power struggles.
