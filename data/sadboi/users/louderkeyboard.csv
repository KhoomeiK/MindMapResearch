bipolar2,fqoouw5,t3_gijlou,1589520605.0,"When I first started on lithium my weight increased so fast I had to get a whole new wardrobe. No amount of running and working out seemed to help so at some point,against doctor's advice,I tapered down n stopped it completely for about a year. I lost all the added weight during this time. But then about a year later I had to be put on it again,but this time it was only 400mg every evening. Even though I braced myself for the weight gain...it didn't happen. I've been on it for around 2yrs now and my weight has stayed pretty consistent throughout the period. Good luck"
Naturalhair,fj2v37s,t3_fb44dc,1582955010.0,"It is completely normal to feel this way. I had this feeling for so long when I first cut my hair. I already have low self esteem and after impulsively cutting my hair,I couldn't stand looking at myself in the mirror. I was stuck with lack of options and I remember one day googling 'how to increase my self esteem after cutting my hair' or something like that and going on a reading spree. Most blogs kept suggesting makeup,which I was never using and I was feeling even more defeated. A few weeks later,I impulsively went and bought red lipstick! My biggest worry was I looked too ugly and I felt like everyone kept looking at my ugly head all the time...and the red lipstick was to act as a distraction. I was redirecting others attention from my ugly looking head. It gave me a little bit of power,I guess. The lipstick did it's job. I stopped getting comments about my hair for starters. But I also had to look at myself in the mirror every morning while applying it...something I had been effectively avoiding since the haircut...and over time, I started noticing small things I loved about my face and my hair. 

Even though the initial plan had been to fake it until my hair was long enough for me to braid or straighten it, with a lot more reading I got to appreciate it a bit more. I've had my natural hair now for about 4 years and wouldn't dream of having it any other way...yet. I play with all sorts of style on it, I dyed it a crazy red colour at some point. And even though my self esteem is still lurking in the lower scale of things, I'm always amazed that when I have to name things I'm proud of about myself,my hair will always make the list."

AskReddit,fikem8x,t3_f8cfjl,1582478904.0,My dad recently revealed to us that he passed up a scholarship to go oversees to study when he found out our mom was pregnant. We haven't all turned out to be people he can be proud of and I feel sick thinking about how better his life would have been if he made a different choice back then.

Naturalhair,fi2k6rd,t3_f62fwg,1582081674.0,"I related to this so much! I went through the Youtubers hair obsession when I first went natural too,and spent many a shillings having expensive products shipped from the US/UK to me(Africa) because none of the recommended products were ever in my country. Since the wool was lifted,I have been able to save so much money! I buy every product from the local shop I walk past on my way to work and my hair is amazing! I live at the coast so we get a lot of coconut oil and that has been my staple for just over a year now. Shampoo,conditioner,leave in then coconut oil...no fancy expensive stuff anymore. My hair is beautiful and feels amazing. I think it helps when we accept our hair for what it is too. Anyway,glad you got this off your chest."
mentalhealth,ffxczz5,t1_ffsi3lw,1580322625.0,I had ECT done and a change in meds some time back and have been a lot more stable since then. Thank you.
mentalhealth,ffrxy1p,t3_eutzn3,1580168425.0,This sucks! I'm so sorry. My first therapist started off great until one Saturday evening he called me late at  night to comment on how I had a beautiful body and I should invite him to come swimming with me next time I went to the pool(my WhatsApp picture was one of me swimming). Was too shaken I just hang up on him and didn't hear from or see him again. It went downhill for me from then on. There aren't many therapists in my country leave alone my town and I'm yet to find one that isn't set on traumatizing me further. Good luck.

bipolar,f6y4p2o,t1_f6xovvm,1573267573.0,Now I'm mostly on lithium and lamictal. And an occasionally stronger sleeping pill if insomnia hits. I still get low with very rare hypomania but I'm yet to get dangerously low.
bipolar2,f6wy9k4,t3_dtd8ds,1573237638.0,Congratulations. You deserve all the good feels you have right now.
bipolar,f5eyr14,t1_f5efo6a,1572176440.0,They suggested it. I had been hospitalized after a breakdown and after a month with no improvement the doctor suggested ect to my family. I don't remember any of the details after the suggestion was made. Think I went for the first session a couple of days later and went back to work about two weeks later.
bipolar,f5eja6c,t3_dnp13h,1572171301.0,Put on something that makes you laugh and just space out. Sometimes that's all I need to ride out the extreme lonely phase. It doesn't always work but it's worth a try.

bipolar,f5ef9z5,t3_dnq6gz,1572169719.0,I had three treatments only and I did notice  a great difference(my family and colleagues agree). My memory was horrible immediately after but now it's been about two years and I haven't gone back down the dark hole I was in before the first treatment. Still have relatively bad short term memory but I'm never sure if it's the lithium or the ect. Hope fully I will never need ect again.
