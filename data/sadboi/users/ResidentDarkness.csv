I can't exactly put my finger on why certain statements spouted by well meaning people irk me. The other day I was scrolling FB and this conservative family member of mine shared a status which said that we should educate women because they will become better mothers through education and I commented that women should be educated because they're human beings with the same right to learning as men and that this post of his excludes women who don't plan to be mothers. This is not the first time I've seen seemingly positive statements about women turn out to have a very negative meaning.

People think that by characterizing women as being sweet, maternal, mushy, eternally kind, 'precious', nurturing, 'pure', etc just ends up hurting women because it makes women out to be these fragile porcelain pieces that must be kept in glass boxes because they absolutely cannot handle life the way men can. Even in liberal circles around me I see this shit attitude. For example if a man is a good doctor it's because he's smart. If a woman is a good doctor it's because she's empathetic. No mention of her expertise there. I was also in an FB argument the other day and this dude tried 'defending' me from another dude by saying 'you can't talk to her like that because women are sensitive and emotional and weaker and you should be kind to her' and it made me even more angry than before. So people shouldn't stick up for me because I'm a person. Men should stick up for me cause I'm a damsel in distress.

There's even this idea that women are tidier and cleaner than men and I'm thinking that I must be less of a woman because I'm not so tidy and organized. Women aren't allowed to be complex people at all. We're either classy ladies or trashy skanky unladylike bitches"

GenderCritical,fozeg42,t1_foysdtb,1588189286.0,The bullshit statement that men make better leaders is officially a lie now. But I know that even having senile rapists in the halls of power isn't going to convince those people who hate women
GenderCritical,fozdkjp,t3_gaby59,1588188871.0,He just exposed to the world that being an actual feminist or having actual feminist thoughts in your mind is being a TERF. The word TERF now means actual feminist.
GenderCritical,foykrn0,t1_foyevam,1588174293.0,"That is true for some members and they are wrong IMO, but a lot of us like me for example don't favor it"

GenderCritical,fowxa17,t3_g9lhvg,1588129144.0,I always found it very ridiculous that showing the skin of the breast is OK but showing the areola is not. It's like writing f*ck instead of fuck and expecting people not to know it's the same thing.
GenderCritical,fowwx2e,t3_g9y53e,1588128920.0,"Tell them it's not about jealousy. It's about women largely catering to men who did nothing to deserve this high treatment and never will. No man, no matter how great he is, is worth dressing up in the hooters way for."
GenderCritical,fowoxw4,t1_fow0uia,1588124126.0,Somebody should start a thread on benevolent sexism and how positive stereotypes can backfire
GenderCritical,fowmcxr,t3_g9wywl,1588122629.0,"Because in classical traditional patriarchy the woman's 'goodness' is inadequacy and insecurity. It has to be that way under traditional patriarchy because that is what ensure her psychological and emotional dependency upon men. If a woman is confident about her looks and her value and her personality she is less easily manipulated and controlled by men and in-laws. Being insecure and all is wrapped up in the silk of 'humility' and sold to the woman. If she's not self deprecating or finds all kinds of flaws in herself or thinks she is also SOMEONE with something worthwhile to say or do, she's not being 'humble' therefore she's a showoff. And of course this is also given a heavy dose of sexualization. Either you're the good 'humble'(read insecure) virgin who waits for a man to validate her or you're the bad whore who is only putting on a show or acting out to attract a man like you're attracting flies to shit because you're lacking everything the 'good virgin' has. In minds like your mum the independent self directed woman doesn't exist, only a woman who reacts to the men around her"
GenderCritical,fovl0dx,t1_fovdhxz,1588103102.0,Thanks for this comment. Not often I see comments like this on here
GenderCritical,fovbj4x,t1_fov4euv,1588098561.0,Lol women aren't born with some magical gift of being good communicators. We become good communicators because patriarchy forces women to shoulder the burden of emotional labour and 'reading body language and faces' because we are supposed to be the ones who put others feelings before our own.
GenderCritical,fov9jos,t1_fov3cil,1588097622.0,In my life I've had shit conversations with dudes and some great ones. The thing in common with the great ones was that the dude was actually responsive to what I was saying and actually cared about using his brain and coming up with good stuff to say during the convos. And the most important thing was them asking me what I thought when they brought up some hot topics
GenderCritical,fov8ajw,t1_fouk1w3,1588097011.0,She was a big hypocrite. Going on and on about women staying at home and raising kids and not going to university yet herself getting a higher education and being very active in public life. Oh but her hubby gave her 'permission' so she thinks it's fine.
GenderCritical,fos7ao6,t1_forgosa,1588025262.0,Writing a book on this subject without including sex trafficking or any of the related stuff to it is not socialist at all.
GenderCritical,foroihi,t1_for4ecq,1588015729.0,"There are quite a few people who like me precisely because I took the time to look past their exteriors and got to know them, so I don't know what you're talking about. So whatevs"
GenderCritical,fop51wi,t1_fop4kj5,1587953241.0,"I don't consider it worth to elaborate further if you're not even trying to understand a simple point as not being judgmental and close minded, so yeah, whatevs"
GenderCritical,fop175m,t1_fooxsou,1587950825.0,"LOL no one decides to get tattoos that make them look like the Bloods, Crips or MS-13, except those people who get those specific tattoos as part of a gang initiation. People usually get tattoos that are quite different to that. It's people like you who think anyone who dresses or looks different to what is mainstream or 'normal' to you who make it difficult for people who want to follow something else to be accepted. Lol I could name several world leaders off the top of my head who wear suits and ties and have no tattoos who have wreaked so much havoc but just cause they look 'clean' and 'respectable' and act classy people still prefer to listen to their sweet words and ignore all the shit they did. As a metalhead who has gotten judged to hell and back on her morals and values for the way she chooses to look and present herself your comments are ignorant AF to me. Like no, I'm not some devil worshipper or mean bitch or loser. Maybe if people learned some basic f'ing manners and actually got to know me, you know, like a normal person. they might find out I'm not so bad after all. But ok whatevs."
GenderCritical,fop098z,t1_fooytfx,1587950237.0,If we're going by those rules then I also have the right to say your opinion is stupid and makes no sense at all. The world doesn't cater to your sensibilities
GenderCritical,fooek11,t1_foodtx1,1587937553.0,"I'm talking about *those* ones who think that straight women can magically change their orientations and be with women and that will solve everything. Of course what you mentioned is sad, but that's not what I was talking about"

GenderCritical,fonn4h8,t3_g8c7kz,1587922666.0,There's a word for this and it's called bisexuality. It's ridiculous to say that sexuality can be a choice. As a straight woman I never experienced attraction to women despite having some very beautiful classmates and colleagues.
GenderCritical,fonm616,t1_fom1rjt,1587922153.0,"You still aren't Kim Jong Un of North Korea who can dictate the number of tattoos and piercings they have, so might as well stop lodging these complaints. Find something better to worry about."
GenderCritical,fonlu40,t1_fol5sez,1587921974.0,No they aren't. Stop assuming shit about people.
GenderCritical,fonlim9,t1_fonfp6e,1587921800.0,"eXaCtLy lIkE TRAs. Lol. That doesn't even make sense as a comparison. To be equivalent I would have to believe in some insane shit, then yeah you could say I'm like a TRA. But I don't. All I'm saying in this regard is to stop complaining about shit that doesn't even affect you. Are you that jobless that someone's tattoos and piercings bother you so much that you spend paragraphs ragging on people who have them? Find something better to worry about in life instead of this first world issue."
GenderCritical,fommaw6,t1_focikdl,1587895457.0,I don't think of pregnancy and childbirth that way
GenderCritical,fomk9zw,t1_foltjnt,1587893199.0,It just isn't a negative thing. I don't know what planet you live on. It costs zero dollars to respect someone's life even if it's different from yours. You are only burdening YOURSELF by worrying about something that shouldn't affect you so much.
GenderCritical,folrlax,t1_folc51k,1587868827.0,Why can't you accept that some people get tattoos for themselves? Do you think they're all stupid and impressionable?
