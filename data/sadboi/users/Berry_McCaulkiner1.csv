When you're not able however, there is social security, and I do think disabled people should be cared for by the government, however, welfare programs are constantly abused by people who are simply looking for a handout, and we can't afford that. I think those programs should be improved to try to eliminate advantage taking. The sad truth about relying on the government for assistance in any regard, is that when the government goes broke, so do you. So yes, it is tough luck for them (and anyone relying on the government). If they can't work, and the government can't provide, all that's left is generosity from others. You have to understand how expensive it would be to supplement the entire population's living expenses in a capitalist society.

Even if your job doesn't have health benefits, you can pay for it out of pocket, or apply for free healthcare. Plus, the healthcare here in America is better than anywhere else precisely because it's not free. The fact that there's so much money to be made in the industry incentivizes people to study healthcare more. Sure, other countries have free healthcare, but the quality is marginal at best. Personally, I would much rather be cared for here than anywhere else because I know that I'll be getting the best care possible. I'm not saying it's a perfect system, and yes it can get quite expensive, but the fact that we have unlimited opportunity here makes it worth it to me. Don't let your depression and personal issues stand in the way of your happiness and success.

I would change ""the log crackling away"" to something like ""a log crackling away in the fireplace"". I'm always cautious of the use of the word ""the"". You don't really want to use it in a descriptive context unless you have already introduced the thing it prefaces (unless it's implied that the thing exists)

I assume Pat is day dreaming, elaborate on that. Describe what he sees in his head. 

I only read the first section btw. Never saw a setting besides the living room. Where are they? Who are they?. Providing this info helps the reader follow the story better.

I noticed that you jump back and forth from past tense to present tense (most of it is in present tense). Be mindful of that, it makes the timeline hard to follow.

You're off to a great start, you have great potential with descriptive lines. You just need to work on your setting, timeline, and grammatical structure. I would recommend reading other people's short stories and maybe watching YouTube vids on how to structure one. Keep it up 💪👌"
