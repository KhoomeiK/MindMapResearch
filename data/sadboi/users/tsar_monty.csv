Zwift,fqprht5,t3_gk8t7w,1589552605.0,"There was another thread the other day asking essentially the same sort of question.

I'm a huge Zwifter – I've logged thousands of miles and spent so many hours spinning away indoors. I used it exclusively for quite a while while I was regaining confidence after a nasty accident. I used it for several winters, rainy days/weeks, and I still use it every weekday morning before work. However, as awesome and amazing as it is, it will never completely replace riding outside for me. I fully acknowledge the danger riding outside can present, especially during this current crisis but the benefits to my mental health, and by proxy everyone I know are massive. Sure I could just stick to Zwift all summer long, but I feel like I'd be voluntarily extracting part of my identity.

It's really easy to justify drinking more, especially when times get tough, but its a slippery slope. Personally I've been trying to buck my 3x a week (Fri-Sun) habit of drinking 3+ drinks on those nights. I want to reduce how much I drink as well as the frequency. I find that my sleeping suffers, my RHR is higher and my recovery is slower. I don't feel like my performance on the bike suffers all that much, but I can't imagine it helps either. The greater issue here is dealing with *why* I feel the need to drink and the psychological effects of it, not the slight performance decrease that may or may not be resulting from alcohol."
EatingDisorders,fqlwqv7,t3_gjgzj8,1589467484.0,"I'm so glad to see a male posting here. Please know that you're absolutely not alone. With that said, I have personally encountered resistance when discussing my own eating disorder here and elsewhere on Reddit because I'm a male. Shame surrounding it is still very much so a contributing factor to why I can't overcome the last bit of my disorder. I am sorry you've encountered resistance like that too, but I commend you for speaking about it. The more visible we are, the more acceptable it will become to talk about it.

There's a lot of hope for you though. I know things are really tough right now, and I completely understand why you're feeling old habits and attitudes return. They've returned for me too. But, you have the incredible benefit of not being too far down the road of an eating disorder. If you get professional help as soon as you're able, I think your chances are good for managing it and taking control of your life again. Please don't hold off on this. Eating disorders have a really unique pathology, if you'll permit the physiological analogy. They have an amazingly easy time distorting the thoughts we have about our body image in relation to our self-confidence and self-worth. It's so easy to justify continuing behaviors because they play perfectly into the story our distorted lizard-brains have told us.

Anyway, professional help with a therapist would help you far better than an internet stranger could. From one young guy to another, don't hesitate to seek help. You're not alone!"
Zwift,fqejrys,t3_gicagm,1589308716.0,"I do about 90% of my rides on Zwift, even in times of good weather.

Plus, I feel great the rest of the day and spend time focusing on projects, spending time with my wife or just lazing about. Then there's the safety issue. I've had some really bad luck and was almost killed while on the bike, so I have some real apprehensions about spending tons of time on the road anymore, especially knowing some of the statistics coming out.

I do still get out at least once per week during good weather though, but it's mostly gravel. I don't regret any of my time on Zwift, but there's nothing quite like the rush of wind and sensation of speed."
EdAnonymousAdults,fpvrly7,t3_gfitqr,1588950561.0,"This is a really interesting place to be – I understand it completely. Being in a very similar boat, it's always interesting to take a step back and examine what I'm telling myself. Eating disorders are different in a few key ways from other mental health disorders, in that we have to face triggers however many times we eat each day, and face triggers every time we are forced to think about food. I don't think I could handle being whittled down and pushed to anxiety every time I face a trigger, so I often resort to 'safe' behaviors and thoughts of 'it's not that bad – I can accept and tolerate some disordered behaviors if it keeps me sane'.

Half-recovery is really tough. I too am at a healthy weight, although on the low end of that. I cannot accept gaining more weight – the thought is truly terrifying to even attempt or allow. But because I'm at a 'healthy weight' it's all good, right? Because I'm a cyclist and need to climb hills faster I need to be on the lower end of that range, right? The mental gymnastics are so hard to deal with, and I commend you for coming here to talk about them...you're not alone."
EdAnonymousAdults,fpo8u8l,t3_ge3y7y,1588780377.0,"'Half recovery' as you term it is an interesting phenomenon. It's a place I'm finding myself in a lot these days, if I'm being honest. I've recovered my weight completely, I no longer restrict, I don't think about food all that often anymore, but I still get hung up on a few key things somewhat regularly.

As my therapist described it, eating disorders alter the brain and therefore thought processes, perceptions and thoughts self-worth, not to mention anxiety around all of it.  For the rest of my life I must accept some measure of eating disorder behaviors. But, that doesn't mean I have to accept being 'disordered', I just have to accept the trauma I went through and the effects it still has on me. I have to choose if the life I want to live in is one of low self-worth, spending half my day obsessing over food, being at risk for medical problems due to low weight and making my life miserable by restricting.

It's not easy – it's a fight and a balance all the time. I personally still struggle with the notion of gaining any weight at all over where I'm at now (which is a recovered weight). I can't get past it, and I'm still relying on the safety of some watered-down old habits to maintain that arbitrary 'perfect' body image. I'm guilty of being half-recovered, but I won't ever stop trying to improve myself and challenging those thoughts every time they arise."
EatingDisorders,fpgx00o,t3_gd8qdd,1588611018.0,"This is a precarious place to be, and in many ways, I'm in a nearly identical situation to yours.

I've struggled with exercise bulimia for quite a while but I'm mostly recovered from it, as well as my anorexia. For me, the lockdown didn't alter much in terms of exercise, but it has really ratcheted up my health anxiety, which in turn affected my perception of body image/idealism. I teetered on the edge of returning to dangerous behaviors much like you – I don't think I've felt this far down into the hole in quite a while. I felt overwhelmed, out of control, angry and depressed more than I have in a long time. I was losing weight and I had 0 appetite.

I'm not sure what your usual exercise routine was like, but definitely make sure you can do something outside. Cycling is my passion – I've loved it for a long time, even through all the eating disorder business. After long deliberations on whether I should ride outside during quarantine, I made the decision and it was absolutely amazing. The wind, sunshine and whirlwind of endorphins were enough to remind me to be grateful for just being alive, healthy and able to climb dozens of massive gravel road hills. It wasn't about punishing myself for food or anything nefarious – all of those miles made the self-hate and loathing completely vanish. I guess that's my advice: exercise outside if you can – try to detach it completely from any negative thoughts about yourself or your body."

Structural change always happens at a glacial pace, and expecting things to be not just back to some form of normal, but better than normal is wishful thinking. We're in the midst of a crisis of epic proportions, especially economically, and I have no faith that employer-sponsored healthcare or better school systems are an inevitable result of it. If anything, those things will become more embedded and worse for the time being.

You're underestimating just how much people want things to return to life exactly as it was before this crisis, and how hard they'll try to make it happen.

I too have been struggling during quarantine, and some of it revolves around my body weight. I also struggle with some of what your therapist talks about. I'm a healthy weight now too, but every time I mention that I receive a strong rebuke. I think this centers less around what's medically healthy, and more around my own thoughts about what constitutes 'healthy' and why I think those things. For example, I was asked recently *why* can't I be okay with gaining a bit more weight. Why am I trying so hard to maintain where I'm at? I hesitated and kind of went off about some ideal body image or perfectionism. I'm using all sorts of behaviours to justify not gaining weight, including the thought 'I'm at a medically healthy weight, even if it's on the low end, so why would I want to gain more?'. Right there, that's anorexia speaking loud and clear, but I've struggled to countermand it, especially now.

I challenge you to try and identify the mental gymnastics involved in justifying being at the weight you're at. It's going to be difficult to break any cycle – eating disorders have an incredible way of co-opting logic and emotion into a really vicious and powerful combination.

Best of luck,"

I made quite a few mistakes with it though. The skiving on the tongue was almost ruined a couple times by driving the knife too hard. It's very thin in a couple spots. The rivets were a last-minute decision because I wasn't confident my pricking irons wouldn't perforate the leather and cause weakness. The rivets I have aren't quite quality enough, but they're holding. I also could have beveled the edges far better if I were more experienced in doing it.

The tongue is slightly too short, which I chalk up to a mismeasurment in the early stage. Plus, after three attempts at making a consistent skive on the belt loop/stay, I just stuck with the same weight for it as the belt itself and just skived off the ends to make a loop. Partly because of this, and partly because the tongue is so short, I had to opt for a floating belt loop because it wouldn't fit under the sets of rivets.

EatingDisorders,fmzq7qy,t3_fyasfr,1586527188.0,"I'll be the dissenting voice here.

First though, I have to note that I never ventured into life-threatening territory with my weight or attitudes about it, but I do have an anorexia diagnosis. I also never had residential or inpatient care – it was all outpatient through an eating disorder therapist.

I found that early in my recovery when I stopped counting calories, I justified eating far less than I needed. I had an attidute of 'I'm eating intuitively, and stopping when I'm full' which basically meant very little food at all. I had no accountability or any real or positive gauge for how much I was eating, so I just ate less. Even in recovery, I was still a cyclist and still burning through calories, and I wasn't replacing them properly, so I continued to lose power and overall energy.

I decided to start counting calories to keep myself from losing weight, but also to keep myself accountable and even gain weight. I successfully did all of those things while also counting calories early on in my recovery. It was hard to break away from fixating on the numbers so much and having new or 'fear' foods, but over time it became far easier. Also, I didn't want to spend the out-of-pocket money on a dietician to set up a meal plan or anything due to the cost – it's not covered by my insurance.

This is definitely not for everyone though, so don't take this as an automatic justification to count calories in your case. It worked for me for a number of reasons that are unique to my own life, so it may not apply to others. Sometimes people in all sorts of supportive communities paint some things as black and white, which is never quite true. While yes, counting calories is generally not advised, there are cases where it can work."

Should we really use 'shorthand' to reduce all men to 'tall people' or any other label? While it's true that biology plays a factor in how men process calories, it makes us no less immune to social pressure to look a certain way and behave a certain way around food and eating. While it's true less men are preoccupied with their weight and appearance, there is study after study out there showing just how prevalent those things actually are among men. There's also plenty of evidence showing that because we've reduced this to a 'woman's issue' that men are 'immune to because of X, Y or Z' they will absolutely not seek help for fear of feeling ostracized or emasculated.

The reduction of a real mental health concern and generalization you're making is exactly why to this day, even with friends and family I never share my history with this disorder."

I always lose weight when I stop counting, but continue training.

It’s not the conventional wisdom of ‘just listen to your body’, ‘your body has a set point’, or ‘get a dietician’ but it works for me and doesn’t cause me stress. I know, without a doubt my body is getting what it needs to get stronger and maintain my recovery. I realize though that this is an exception, and not a rule.

It takes a long time to incorporate things like treats and sweets into this, but realizing they won’t kill me, and I do actually deserve those things sometimes, and they’re things I sometimes want is really helpful. Again, that takes a lot of time to internalize and believe, but it’s possible."

Some of what you're describing is totally natural, like the lack of privacy during Telehealth with your therapist. Those types of things are real challenges, and the solutions are composed of sort-of compromises at best.

However, even though this time is exhausting, anxiety-inducing and scary, you definitely have it within you to fight this. Living with your parents who are clearly oblivious to your triggers and mental state makes the fight harder, but there are some things you can do to mitigate that. For example, can you sit them down and talk to them about how those comments make you feel? I challenge you to really evaluate your options in dealing with you parents – there's no telling how long we'll be stuck in quarantine, and being bombarded by triggers is no way to heal. I know it may be hard to muster up the courage to talk to them about it, though.

One thing to realize is that restricting and purging makes your body in many ways less able to fight viruses like Covid-19. When you're restricting and purging, you're depriving your body of the nutrients and energy it needs to fight a virus, but I'm sure you know that.

I know this is hard. It's hard for me too.

I'm not excited about it, nor am I upset, which is a big concern.

Things have been really stressful, to be fair. I've worried about my health, my wife's health, our jobs, the economy, and all of it its outside of my control. I feel like this entire state of affairs is a huge trigger that's making me grasp for anything I can control, which is of course my food intake. I'm trying not to let it win though. The less I eat, the closer I get to being underweight, which means the more susceptible I am to not weathering a disease like Coronavirus well.

I started my professional career after college only a few years ago. I don't have family members to take care of or kids, but the 40-hours per week mandate is taxing and draining. There's never enough time to just, well, live, be human and enjoy things anymore. Everything is about getting to work, working, getting home and preparing for work the next day. Everything else loses some degree of importance. Without a doubt we're well overdue for a change in how people conduct business in relation to employee life satisfaction.

With that part said, there's nothing we can do to change that now, and all we can do is work with what we have. It's all about setting priorities and making boundaries. Some things will suffer at the expense of others, but that's all part of the game. You have to try and scrape together something that resembles a balance, but it'll demand some tough choices.

It's hard to accept sometimes, and it's even harder to accept that it won't end for the next 40+ years of your life. Just try and take care of yourself as best you can with the time you have though.

Anxietyhelp,fk44jpi,t3_fg9ksf,1583853158.0,"This is something I relate with really strongly.

I've been dealing with health anxiety for years now, and I've only truly found help through therapy. A lot of my fears surround the surge in large-scale and life-threatening medical issues I've had in less than 5 years. I had a tumor removed 5 years ago, a TBI 4 years ago, a hernia and hydrocele repaired 3 years ago, and a fractured pelvis and shattered elbow fixed two years ago. That's an insane amount of problems in a short period of time, and while some of it is accident related, I'm always, always paranoid about any pain I have.

It's led me to some dark places, and it's definitely not helped my compulsion to be as healthy as possible, 24/7. I have an eating disorder too, which plays right into that.

Sounds like my life sucks, right? Well, it doesn't. While health anxiety and all the other issues I have aren't good by any measure, they don't define me. None of what happened guarantees something else will. Just because I smacked my head on some concrete doesn't mean it's going to happen again. Just because I had a tumor doesn't mean every pain is a symptom of cancer.

In one word: therapy. Therapy has helped me deconstruct these crazy ideas I was having about nutrition. It's such a hard nut to crack because there's so many layers woven together – modern diet culture, athleticism, social media, beliefs about myself, my family's history, and so much more.

I arrived at that conclusion based on a long amount of time challenging those things and making peace with myself. So much of what you tell yourself isn't based in any real evidence, facts or reality. It's just the lies we tell ourselves, and it's so easy to just believe them because the mind can justify nearly anything if you give it the right context.

Yes, cake isn't as full of vitamins and nutrients like some other foods, but in the context of a social function, it's not 'bad'. Humans have been celebrating and gathering with the accompaniment of food and drink since the dawn of time. It's why it's so hard to have a gathering of adults without food or drink involved – it's just what we do and it's vital for human connection. Furthermore, there's plenty in cake that's actually quite good. It has carbohydrates, protein, fats and everything else.

People in this modern age are so easily susceptible to messages that demonize food groups at the detriment of their social health. Loneliness is running rampant across the world, and a lot of people are refusing slices of cake at a gathering of friends or family because it doesn't fit with whatever diet culture nonsense is being spouted off.

I actually have an eating disorder, and it's taken me way, way too long to reach that conclusion and believe it. One slice of cake at a wedding will not make me 'unhealthy' or 'fat' or whatever other negative self-talk I tell myself. It makes me a human being with a healthy social life."

This isn't like alcohol where I can excise it from my life completely and isolate myself from most triggers. Food isn't something I can just say no to – after all isn't that the root of the issue?

But that isn't a sign of despair. I'm recovered now after going way down the path of ED, and I've mostly made peace with the fact that it's always going to be a part of me. Like some others, it's not my identity anymore though. Through therapy, I have learned to effectively challenge my ED-related thoughts and manage it.

I'm a 26 y/o male and I developed anorexia when I was in college, just as I was starting out on my intense days of cycling. It wasn't really an issue until after I graduated and started to enter races and train really hard. I dropped my weight down to 110lbs while seriously training to win, was afraid of all sorts of foods, ate like 2000kcal a day at max and didn't partake in anything that I thought would make me gain weight. For a lot of that time, much like you, I didn't 'want' to be skinny either, but I was so afraid of fat.

I didn't even see how thin and unhealthy I was. I wasn't winning any races either, but of course I just chalked it up to not training hard enough. It wasn't until I basically had an epiphany after I got in a nasty accident in a race that I really saw everything for what it was. I had anorexia, and it was time to do something about it. I got professional help, and I was determined to get better. I challenged everything, starting eating at a surplus (which was so, so hard to do) and I gained weight. No, I didn't get fat. I didn't lose my health. Hell, I didn't even lose my fitness.

So don't be me. Don't go down the path I went down. Don't lose the memories, the bonding, the joys of life because you're afraid of a little fat. I wish so much I could go back and just make myself see what I was doing – to listen to my family and friends when they pointed out how thin I was, or how little I was eating. The best I can do now is live my life unencumbered by fear of a bit of a gut, or a pizza, or vacations, but I'll never get back the years I spent stricken by fear."

EatingDisorders,fjdvlsw,t3_fcstye,1583260119.0,"What's happening to you and your fears of gaining weight is totally normal in recovery. A major component of eating disorders is not being able to see and assess your body accurately. Body dysmorphia can manifest itself in many different ways, and what you're describing is definitely within those bounds.

I went through the same thing when I started my own recovery, when I felt like eating normally was just causing me to pack on fat. There was such negative self-talk about any kind of weight gain, much like you. I also had this sense of superiority over other people when I ate less than them, didn't get excited about food like them, and was super judgmental about people who were getting excited about a 'bad' food. My anorexic body was a symbol of pride in. It's all totally false though, and it hurt me so much.

I made a lot of peace with gaining weight and seeing it as a positive thing. I turned that negative self-talk into acceptance and positivity about myself other than body image. It took a lot of work, a lot of time, and a lot of sessions in therapy to convince myself that I'm okay. To this day, I still struggle some with weight fluctuations, but I know that because I have this disorder, I cannot assess my own body shape accurately, nor see it, no matter what shape it is, as a healthy part of being a human. It's still scary, but I accept that I feel this way in a sense. I accept that it's only a small part of who I am now."

I've been in recovery for quite some time now, and while my BMI is in the mid-to-low end of normal, my therapist still doesn't like that I'm happy with that and still considers it 'low'. By all medical metrics, I am recovered and healthy. The catch is that I am totally immovable about the weight I'm at. I have no desire to gain more weight, even if it's still in the normal range. A lot of that comes from a fear of creeping towards the overweight category, which I equate with body dysmorphia. Combine that with some eating habits I still need to work on and bam, I'm not totally recovered yet.

I guess the point is BMI is ONLY indicative of clear and present danger to one extreme or the other. What matters a whole lot more is attitudes, emotions, responses and overall mental status."

Like you, I used to be extremely strict with when I could eat, how much I could eat, where I could eat. But with therapy I started to realize, 'What does it mean about me if I eat lunch at 12 instead of 1, or dinner at 6 instead of 7?' Does it mean I'm not being perfect? Does it mean I'm a failure? The answers, once I challenged those thoughts became 'no'. It says nothing about me when I eat, and being so incredibly rigid just shows how under the influence of an ED-mindset I am.

With that said, I still do keep really regular mealtimes and I generally resist changing them. However, I learned to challenge the reasoning for keeping so strictly to that routine when life happens and plans change. For me, it just took a stream of challenges of what I thought a change like that meant to me and other people. First though, that takes some time to stop and breathe, then reassess what's happening.

It's that body image-to-worth connection that's the hardest part of the late-recovery stage. I have to remind myself all the time that I'm worth so much more than my body image, and part of me genuinely believes it. I believe that I'm a great worker, a great husband, a great cyclist and have so much going so well, but would I be devastated if I started to gain weight and look 'fat'? Yes, I absolutely would. There's still a connection between my worth and my body image. I'm at the point of 'is it balance if I can fight that thought successfully most of the time?'.

My recommendation is to take that knowledge and find a doctor who can refer you to a trained therapist. Universities usually have fairly robust mental health counseling, so this shouldn't be too much of a problem. The reasons for doing what you're doing are concerning and should be addressed properly.

Things like reducing overall carbohydrate consumption in favor of more protein and fat is a healthy way of reducing hunger during the day. Protein and fats are more satiating and keep you fuller longer.

Eating bigger meals is sometimes an effective strategy too, because if you're eating more then theoretically you'll be less hungry over time.

The hard part is that sports and exercise are inherently great things. There's so much good, not just from a physical health perspective, but also from a teamwork, social and achievement perspective.

With that said, sports are competitive, no matter what it is. My sport is cycling, and competition very much so comes with the territory. Weight is also a huge factor for a lot of competitive cyclists, and it played perfectly into my disordered thinking when I was down in the trenches with my disorder.

I remember I really started getting serious about winning races when I was near my lowest weight a couple years ago. I was training super hard, and restricted my diet even more in pursuit of being leaner and thinner so I could go faster and perform better. What a lie that was. I wasn't winning because I didn't have any energy – I wasn't fueled right and my body was screaming at me to stop. I didn't see it that way, though. I just thought ""if I just train harder and control my diet a bit more, I'll win."" I didn't see my disordered thinking, which took up a huge amount of my mental space, and my dangerously low weight as problems that prevented me from being good at something I love.

I wasn't using this system long before I switched to CBT because my eating disorder condition warranted it. CBT is effective in challenging those sorts of conditions with a higher degree of success, but there is some doubt out there about it's long-term effectiveness. It doesn't really get at the root of the issue as much as it reacts to present triggers. Its fairly agnostic towards your history and previous life experiences, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a highly effective strategy of coping with triggers in the moment. I'd say just try out different forms of therapy and see what's working.

I had some base-level hormone tests done to see about my thyroid and other hormones. Everything is totally normal, as are my eyes."
TBI,fgspcpd,t3_f03w6p,1581089773.0,"Congratulations on your recovery! I'm so glad to hear things are looking better for you.

It's really disheartening to learn that you were basically told nothing is wrong with you when clearly, things weren't right. It's a huge problem in the medical community, and reading stories like this really give the entire systemic issue a real, human face. I'm sorry that it took years for you to get the help you needed – that's an inexcusable offense by your doctors. In fact, it's way too common that doctors don't take the connection between TBIs and mental health seriously. A lot of that probably has to do with the lack of training and overall lack of knowledge about neurology in connection to overall health. In some ways it's not their fault, but that does little to console someone who's really seeking help.

However, there's nothing you can do about what happened before, and right now you have a very bright and exciting future to look forward to. Best of luck on this part of your journey!"
TBI,fgskqdo,t1_fgrgjn1,1581086770.0,"First off, congrats on making it one year! It's a really, really tough road, but you should be proud that you are here, alive, and experiencing the world.

Initially, I was kind of left to fend for myself in terms of long-term recovery. After I got home from the hospital, I was mostly cared for by my friends and family. They were told to scrutinize my actions and report anything that was really off if there were to be anything. So things like drastic personality changes, seizures, memory issues, motor functions, etc. Luckily, I didn't have any of those, so further immediate help from doctors apparently wasn't warranted.

However, as time went by and some of my mental health issues accumulated, I started seeing a therapist first practicing ACT, but then moved to two separate therapists to help me using mostly CBT. As stated above I had a lot of anxiety, health anxiety and an eating disorder, which naturally is tied in with those other things. I know some people express skepticism about CBT, but the strategies for dealing with issues on a day-to-day basis are effective in my experience. I've been told I could benefit from SSRIs, but I have declined to use them."
TBI,fgsk65g,t1_fgqlpgd,1581086382.0,"I'm glad you brought up the part about the mental trauma you experienced because of your fracture. I keep believing that I should have a more traumatic relationship with what happened, that I somehow should be in more distress because of it. It's almost as if I want to see it like say, a soldier would have experienced a traumatic event in wartime. It's really not like that at all, despite how terrible it was. It's a lot like how you describe it – a memory of a movie scene.

Sure, there was a lot of trauma from the event, but most of it came a lot later when I started to accumulate memories that I still have, but of course most of those were after the initial accident.

However, I did experience something that was really strange, and I still think about it. I remember a moment when I was lucid, and I don't remember where it was or when it was, but I remember being awake and only seeing brightness, but with an utterly intense feeling of fear. I think for a moment I thought I was dead, or close to being dead. It's something that has stuck with me, and I don't know how, or even if it still impacts me. I haven't talked about it with anyone much, but I don't know if I should.

The health anxiety really ramped up after this accident though, and manifested in ways very similar to how it did for you. It probably doesn't help that I really did have real medical concerns shortly before, and afterwards – all of which were unrelated to the TBI. What it amounts to is that on top of my fear of danger in the physical sense, I'm also paranoid about slight aches and pains, and each one could be fatal to me. It's a tough thing to break, but like I said before, I can't imagine some of that fear doesn't somehow come from what happened to me with my head injury.

Yes, this is a lot of insight from a forum post! Thank you for sharing your journey! If you want to talk more though, feel free to PM me, and I'm happy to chat more if this is getting too open!"
Iowa,fgpw0su,t1_fgpen6l,1581013090.0,"I completely agree with your assessment of the state of voting in this country. We have systemic and complex issues that are being almost wholly ignored, and in some cases actively abated by politicians. It's incredibly discouraging to know that our entire voting system is so incredibly backwards and restrictive that huge swaths of people are effectively eliminated from the vox populi.

However, none of that vindicates the caucusing process. Indeed, our voting system is broken, but the process of caucusing doesn't help. A primary presents its own problems, many of them are the one's you mentioned, but a primary is far less restrictive and less likely to fall into despair like our caucus did on Monday. A caucus makes a system that's already broken into an even more complicated and restrictive process."
TBI,fgp9yot,t1_fgoiq8b,1581000388.0,"I'm glad you're recovering okay too!

The link between TBI and anxiety is something I've brought up with multiple therapists, but I don't know if any of them have really taken the link seriously. It seems like they focus exclusively on the issue at hand instead of viewing the TBI as a potential link in the equation. In your experience, was there a difference in treatment from a neuropsychologist and a psychiatrist or therapist? Also, what type of medication did you take and has it helped? These are all avenues I'm willing to explore if it helps.

I'm also really curious about what your doctor told you about resuming cycling and the risk of cumulative effects. It was something that was mentioned to me by someone, but I wasn't sure how seriously to take it. I resumed cycling and since my TBI accident, I was actually in another accident that broke a few bones and fractured my pelvis – no head impact though.

Lastly though, do you have any mental trauma about your bike accident? It's something I've been thinking about for some time, and it's mostly gone unaddressed, but I'm sure it has something to do with my anxiety, and particularly my health anxiety too."
Iowa,fgnd5dh,t3_ezf2ba,1580942349.0,"I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it: the entire caucus process is a mockery of the democratic voting process in their country.

It failed at everything already - being open to more than just the professional class with disposable time, accessible enough for people with disabilities, and representative of the population. But to top it off, the one thing it’s supposed to get right - actual vote counts, it screws up so badly that this entire state has become a laughingstock."
TBI,fgnafl0,t1_fgmzy6z,1580940772.0,"I’m glad to hear that your anxiety has faded some! It’s hopeful to hear that.

The post-injury fear has bled into a really nasty health anxiety that I battle all the time. Every pain is a symptom of something terrible, and it’s tough to effectively challenge those ideas when they pop up.

I suspect the eating disorder is tied up with that, so it’s perhaps related to the injury in some way."
Zwift,fgmpt5c,t3_ezb0zd,1580929586.0,It's really strange. I posted about an issue I was having with the app for MacOS a while ago.

germany,fgmhp3g,t1_fgl97l2,1580924778.0,"You know, HEAD INJURIES ARE SERIOUS.

A few years ago, I was riding my bike with a helmet and got into an accident that caused a subarachnoid hemmorage and a subdural hematoma. I don't remember hardly any of what happened during the accident or much of anything for the following day. A police officer reportedly called an ambulance even though I kept telling him that I was fine and that I would ride home. Had I absolutely refused, I would probably be dead right now. 

I don't know how people don't take these things seriously. If you're not shot, stabbed or bleeding everywhere it's not a serious injury? Really?"
Iowa,fgiyeob,t1_fgiq369,1580833500.0,"It's not just that it doesn't scale well, it's also extremely restrictive because of the limited start time, locations and physical presence for hours at a time.

politics,fggoqvd,t3_ey2agv,1580766279.0,"This will be my second Iowa Caucus. After two of these, I'm realizing just how archaic and backwards they really are.

We have enough barriers to voting in this country, why are piling on EVEN MORE by restricting who gets to vote by restricting it to a very specific time, place, and duration? Pretty much the only people who get their voices heard are young professionals without kids, students and retirees. Everyone else, including workers with irregular schedules, those with disabilities and those without the time to spare are kicked out of the entire process.

The question is, how do we go about changing it? It always seems like these kinds of things are beyond what we can realistically change."
Iowa,fgg98mv,t1_fgful89,1580756980.0,"The entire caucus process is incredibly antiquated and completely not designed for any kind of gathering on a modern scale. The gathering at a specific time, at a specific place for hours on a weeknight evening makes the entire thing extremely inaccessible to vast swaths of our population.

It's already bad enough that Iowa is one of the most un-diverse states in the US, but now it only fits the schedules and lifestyles of people that can afford to actually go to the event.

Let's ditch this outdated process and turn it into a primary-day."
bicycling,fg080j0,t3_evx4jm,1580402199.0,"I see stuff like this all the time on this subreddit, other subreddits and on local media. It's extremely sad to see thousands killed, injured or disabled by this utterly toxic and destructive car-focused culture we have in this country.

I love this sport. It is a passion and I live to bike. However, I'm finding it harder and harder to justify getting on my road bike at all this year. I've been in a few nasty accidents, and I don't know if I can stomach the risk of getting into another one that could end my life or mess me up. It's sad, but I feel like I'll be spending most of my time on Zwift to keep my fitness up. On the weekends, maybe I'll hit up a group and ride on only gravel where there aren't crazy drivers, but that's it.

It's not worth it to me anymore. It's clear that we can't change how dominant cars are in this country. We can't change people's minds that there are real people, with families, aspirations, jobs, and love sharing the road with them. I won't risk my life any longer."
