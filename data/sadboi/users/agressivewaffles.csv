GriefSupport,fbygpwt,t3_ef5boc,1577216462.0,I don’t have any advice or suggestions. I do want to say that I’m sorry for your loss. This is such an amazing photo; you are looking at him with so much love and it just radiates. I hope the holidays come softly for you and your family.
Austin,fbinfsu,t3_ecmucr,1576906593.0,Have you looked into muzzle training with a basket muzzle? It might offer some feelings of security for you/the groomer while y’all move forward with desensitizing him!

whatisthisthing,eyumlmp,t3_cywoee,1567466261.0,I just moved into a new house and found two of these outlets in the living room. What could they be used for? The home is apparently built in the 1970s. I’m thinking something to do with old phones?

depression,evpvr0o,t3_ckmvf8,1564681141.0,"That happens to me a lot. If there’s something important to work on, I’ll write it down on my phone before hand. I’ll also sometimes just say when I have a hard time. Like “hey, so my brain is super foggy today and I’m struggling but I don’t know why.” Then we can sorta work together on what I want to get out of the session. 

For people who have had bad therapists, I get it. I have seen 6 over the years, and I really only clicked with 2, and 2 others were straight up bad at their jobs. I find that I prefer a social worker, and I also find it helps to be super upfront during the first session. For example, I told my current therapist that I don’t like it when the professional talks to much about their own experiences or is just nodding/silence, I need a balance. I told her I do like homework, but meditation isn’t my thing. And it has worked out beautifully.

Obviously it’s tricky because if you haven’t really been to therapy much you can’t say what you like.  You can sort of guess based on how you like to communicate with others. You can also say “so I’m new to therapy, and I don’t know what kind of preferences I have yet. Can we check in during our __ session and see if there should be changes? 

I’m a mental health professional, and I see therapy as a tool. I absolutely love it, and I think a lot of people will benefit with the right fit. But that fit is crucial, and it takes time to build rapport. There are other tools as well, including medication, meditation, group therapy, time with friends, lifestyle changes etc. It’s all about what fits with your needs. 

TLDR: Advocate for yourself. Tell the therapist what you need or if you are having a hazy day. They work for you."

wholesomememes,erlj9dj,t1_erlfez6,1560988663.0,"I don’t think so. I’ve seen a slightly different quote attributed to poet Nikita Gill:

“If you have been brutally broken, but still have the courage to be gentle to others then you deserve a love deeper than the ocean itself.”"
