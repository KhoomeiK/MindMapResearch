Anxiety,ezxz8cb,t3_cwp11b,1568253460.0,I don’t want to worry anyone. I’m used to taking care of everyone else it’s hard for me to trust others to do the same
Anxiety,eyf70kb,t3_cwp11b,1567044364.0,"An ex of mine did this to me. I held on thinking I could save us or him. That paired with him being best friend with booze was hard to compete with. And my blindness to red flags at times....lasted a couple years. And most of that was long distance. Like over seas long distance. 

&#x200B;

And then on the other hand...I've started to do this to others too. And they don't even know it! -\_\_-"
Anxiety,eyf5sdi,t3_cwkbxv,1567043850.0,"Just this week I got a ""There's no perfect job and no perfect relationship...and that most people are struggling too."" And from someone different ""You should go see a psychotherapist."" And I can understand that it is hard giving advise to anyone. Even if you asked for advise or a shoulder to lean on. I really just want to hear that you care about me...."
Anxiety,euep30y,t3_cfw29g,1563750046.0,"My anxiety is the worst at night. However I go weeks and weeks where I write in my journal. Or I’m so tired I pass out. Then there are nights where I stay up over thinking and worrying. I also got in a bad habit of scrolling fb and Instagram before bed. I’d find myself comparing myself to others and naturally more questions would form. I like to control things I have no control over. My future is one big question mark. I know in my age group/ peers are all going through the same thing. Seeing others get married, have kids, and be successful. And I’m not there yet. I’m single, preschool educator, and won’t be able to afford a place of my own because no bank would let me get a mortgage due to my wage.  and then I question all together what career I want because I also love to write. Literally the thoughts don’t stop. Sleep meditation vids on YouTube work 80 percent of the time. Unless I cry myself to sleep."
AskReddit,etsrnux,t3_ccy8oy,1563153621.0,"Here's the sitch. For me it's a lot more then ""I'm not looking"", ""I'm not ready"", ""being single is fun"" etc. All lot of my reasoning is due to the fact that I am emotionally and mentally unable to invest in a relationship at this point in my life. It's perfectly ok to be lonely and wanting companionship, we're freakin mammals. But not in the way where I want to be with someone, to be loved. I fall hard and fast for men who say they love me but don't treat me the best. My mom always said that before you can truly love anyone you need to love yourself first. I do have self love and I know I'm an amazing person. But I'm blindly attracted to all the wrong guys. I'm a nurturing, big hearted, kind person and can be easily taken advantage of. And i'd ignore red flags hoping it wasn't that big of a deal. Or I could fix them. Or my love was enough. And no you can't change people. I think everyone needs to learn that for themselves to believe it. Last year, I was with someone who was verbally and emotionally abusive. And I got the hell out of there as fast as I could. aside from that,  I've been to therapy for depression, a bad break up, and anxiety. Which kind of shed light on things I need to work on. I've come a long way. And I'm proud of myself. I know one day, some lucky guy is gonna snatch me up and put a ring on it. Soooo before that I'm gonna have the time of my lifeeeeeeeeee."
Anxiety,epu8y99,t3_bvxmtt,1559505842.0,I'm glad I'm not the only one. Sometimes it happens and I'm not even realizing it. One of my past employers used to call me on it all the time. Like I was annoyed or something. When I'm just trying to get a regular breath cycle going again. Maybe the situation was a little tense and I've processed it...maybe it's the way I let it go. It was like she thought I was holding back or something.
