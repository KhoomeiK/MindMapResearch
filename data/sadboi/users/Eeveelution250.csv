fnki,fqt1ssx,t1_fqg7gvz,1589627026.0,"I totally agree with you. It’s so stupid, like as soon as someone is affectionate people in this fandom jump and say they’re romantically interested in each other. Like when Ironwood hugged Qrow people called them gay. No dude come on grown men can hug each other after not seeing them for over a year. 
I think people forget Miles and Kerry sat down with Monty and had so much content planned out so while some dialogue may have been different they’re gonna get the characters to where they’re suppose to be. 
As for bumblebee I have always been a fan of it but didn’t mind black sun either. If they had just kept Blake and Yang as besties I’d have been fine with it but now they’re heavily suggesting that they’re more than just friends I hope they stick with it. It may not be endgame but as long as they both survive the series I’ll be fine either way.

People just need to relax a bit and stop attacking others who disagree with them."

It happened many other times throughout the day, so I was on edge.

To make things even more evil the next day I shook one of my friends and said the same thing to them about being in a coma. They turned to me and gave the blankest expression “I have no clue what you’re on about” after me being insistent they done it all day yesterday.
