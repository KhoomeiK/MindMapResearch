You also sound weak people can smell that. “Call centre talk” or the bullshit way hotel workers, call centre workers, some restaurant servers are trained to speak to ppl often just infuriates them more. We can hear the fake in your voices. You’re trained to do it. I’ve done  these Jobs and hated it for that reason. You have to be fake.  people appreciate realness above the pre programmed platitudes any day anytime.

Not saying the wayto deal is to be real. Hardon acall center job, easier in a restaurant. But humanity can smell weakness, fakeness and inauthenticity quicker than fresh shit and they don’t like it. When already frustrated trying to soothe someone with that crap is like feeding blood to a shark."

sociopath,fqvd82l,t3_gkx2z6,1589674804.0,"Assuming moral relativism as the “truth” or only truth is your first and very crucial mistake.

Moral relativism exists. But so do things like empathy , guilt , remorse. In 99% of people.  Choosing specifics like dogs and guns can lead one to believe moral relativism is the last stop for truth but it’s not. Psychopaths are different than typical humans. Empathy exists and helps keep people from killing each other before they can breed."

stepparents,fprlmw3,t3_geyzn9,1588857095.0,"Obviously the “gentle” approach isn’t working. Seriously? Buying them toys when they’re shitting themselves are you nuts? Kids like that need a firm hand. And I don’t mean physical abuse. They need to be told. They need consequences they need to know who the boss is otherwise THEY think they’re the boss. From the sounds of things that’s how it is! 

Hard to get the respect back when it’s gone but ultimately someone needs to take the reigns and it doesn’t sound like it’s gonna be dad."

For you, if you’re jealous it’s gonna be really hard. Guys get less attention too. If it’s something she really wantsbest to let her explore it but also keep in mind your feelings matter. If you try it and don’t want it be firm. Otherwise, ride it out."

recording,flv3t0v,t3_frb51k,1585515778.0,Even GarageBand for Mac has a bunch of presets. Can make wild sounding music and never know how to play so much as a chord.
Paranormal,flv38zy,t3_fr5sap,1585515450.0,"My experience with a demon was odd and lasted a few months. The smell was part of it. And noises.

What I learned was that it needs your participation in order to exist. It will make smells sounds and try to install fear or control. It’s not enough to not pay attention, you have to genuinely not be afraid and essentially overcome your own fright in order to “best” it.

Mine “followed” me for months causing pain, making noise, and stinking every so often. Not much psychical ever happened. But man it was scary.

As I would come out of sleep I would feel a pain encircle my heart and stay there alllll day. Would tap on the walls. It was fucked lol.

I’d try “fighting” it. Never worked. By engaging you are participating and giving it power. That’s all it wants. It needs YOU to exist in your world. That’s what I learned and was my experience. 

At the end of the day, with supreme confidence and genuine lack of concern i bested it. I can still feel it sometimes, if I choose to. I stay strong in my heart and divert attention and it melts away. Every. Damn. Time.

It needs your attention to be real for you. Things are a little more nuanced than that but it’s the best I have. Very strange stuff and although I was terrified at the time the experience was worth it. Used to be afraid of ghosts and stuff. Not anymore. It’s all in your faith and personal power! Knowing it can’t touch you Is everything. Then it can’t. You’re in control. It’s like the time I “knew” I could ride my bike with no hands and I tried and did it. I was like 8 years old. But when I had doubt it insecurity my bike would wobble. The demon, or fragmented part of yourself however you want to see it, is the same. 

Edit: the scariest bit was that very occasionally OTHER people would smell it or hear it tapping away too. Very fucked up. And I was convinced it was attached to me, not any one place, although I met it at a particular spot."

occult,fkariyj,t3_fgxvua,1584017649.0,"Primal is a good word for it. Pan, baphomet...these are “Earth” energies , particularly Pan. “Pan-Demic” ...-these terms come from something. “Dark” magic is more Earthly than light. Light is not of this world and isn’t about reward here and now. Light is ethereal. Dark is Material, earthly, gain. It’s potent. It’s real. I’m drawn to it too and have messed with light energies a lot too.

It’s like when someone apologizes for shit behaviour people sense weakness and start jumping all over them. It’s actually fucking sick and usually happens on the internet more than real life.
unpopularopinion,fisjuoy,t3_f9cirz,1582686217.0,I think the argument is that the struggles of the past DID have meaning at the time. I think in a sense you are right and that the idea of progress is to eliminate unnecessary struggle (among other things). I think that the question is if that is actually a good thing for people at all. The idea of progress is just that...an idea...

sociopath,fis0hkd,t3_f9gigl,1582674987.0,"I OP is confusing regret with remorse. Regret is more akin to committing a crime and getting caught and being unhappy with consequence e.g. jail time for a sloppy crime. Regret is wishing one had acted differently and, I think, feeling bad or angry about it.

I’m Curious if sociopaths can relate to feelings of regret!

Remorse is more akin to your second example. It has to do with acknowledgement of wrongdoing and is closer to guilt. Usually leading to atonement. I dont think sociopaths feel remorse."
sociopath,fis0aci,t1_firmvge,1582674857.0,I think OP is confusing regret and remorse. Regret might be if you really fucked up e.g. did a sloppy crime and wound up with 10 years in jail. Remorse is more akin to guilt and atoneing for wrongdoing.

I think it’s his versatility and ability to improvise and stay consistently awe inspiringly creative all on a dime. He is a waterfall of ideas.  Beyond the pure technical skill and iron right hand (he is like a metronome) his creativity blows me away. 

Also, the music he has written is like classical music in a lot of ways. Tinkles, Mulches..."

Even if the title is true you know it’s kind of coloured strangely...odd move imo...Particularly when confession sub is supposedly used for some wrongdoing OP has done... not had done to them...maybe I’m wrong...anyway, sorry you experienced that. it’s fucking terrible and not your fault, clearly.

nonmonogamy,fev7rig,t1_femxb71,1579394195.0,"Ya that's pretty much my fear.  That the feeling won't go away and it's just not for me.  I suppose just really trying it out would be the only way to know, but I feel badly because I jerked around our current meta-interest quite a bit withdue to being into it and then not.  All very suddenly."
nonmonogamy,fev459m,t1_fepdmv1,1579392934.0,"That is really interesting.  Like that is a really long time to put up with those feelings.  I havent given it enough of a chance to see that.  We just broke things off with the one love interest we shared, mostly for that reason."
musicians,fe8pnud,t3_enw6jj,1578928994.0,If they are passionate and talented enough they will learn quickly if you guys put in the time together. Another thing that’s important is often if you’re starting with someone from scratch and you keep going together for a long time they will develop a unique style that matches you provided you have chemistry.
stepparents,fdvnfyr,t3_eml9aw,1578749415.0,Sounds a little unbalanced
stepparents,fdvlyn9,t3_emvl5w,1578748827.0,"He is expecting too much imo. He doesn’t understand the step parent bond not only takes longer but will never be exactly the same as bio parent bond with their child. This is often harder for stepmoms because it is more accepted for step dads to be a little more distant. The mommy role is tougher. That said, 6 months is really not a long time. It has taken me nearly 2 years to develop a strong , real , loving bond with my stepkids. I am 27m if that helps. I adore them, but i do get frustrated.

Before this sub I was convinced I was just an unloving asshole because I felt distant from
Them. Then I realized step parenting is not the same bio parenting. More accurately, step parents don’t feel the same as bio parents usually. We still love our kids though.

Hopefully you can be open and honest with your husband because he (like most people) expect you to feel the same as him about his son but it’s just not really realistic. In time though, who knows?

If you love your husband and kids you guys will be fine. Plus, SS is moving out of the “kid” stage. He will get steadily more independent through the following years. 12-13 is a massive change. Have fun! It’s gonna be busy."

aspd,fdiy9m7,t1_fdie46i,1578453797.0,"THe value of small talk is the energetic and emotional exchange, which is why folks with aspd find It particularly annoying. No emotional exchange thus no gain. It bonds “normal” people, makes them more comfortable and can lead to bigger talks. It’s stupid but it’s part of socialization and development. Birds cooing at each other can amount to the same thing."
sociopath,fdixss3,t3_elb2p7,1578453482.0,"Ya know, even non sociopaths hate small talk and don’t necessarily pretend to like it. I usually just kind of steer conversations to something I’m interested in or break them off, politely."

Kids are very sensitive to dominance hierarchy’s, the talking over you and causing a scene is to divert attention to her. If you genuinely get along awesome with your girlfriend and she thinks it’s workable then...it probably is? You sound oversensitive in a way and get down on yourself and situations pretty easily. Getting drunk in your office because the kid is too much? Idk man. Pull up your pants, Jack would be my advice. Or run away and give up.
