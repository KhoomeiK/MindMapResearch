He's taken a team that went to the conference finals twice in 5 years to a team that would have missed the playoff 4 out of 5 years if not for the shut down. In 8 years he hasn't been able to solve the scoring or centre problems, while also creating problems with the defence. Drafting has been poor, with no key players on the team being Bergevin picks. We have some prospects and young players, but none of them give me much hope things will turn around for this team.
