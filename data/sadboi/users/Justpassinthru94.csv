Please just do what you are passionate about, and don't waste your time worrying about it. Hey, look on the bright side knowing you didn't flunk out 3 times like I did. Then again, you don't need a degree to know that you are something special. I know that almost everyone on this subreddit likes to hate on themselves for not living up to some one-size-fits-all standard set forth by society, but we all have our own experiences. There's nothing Wrong with you guys. I know it means nothing coming from a stranger like me but please just do what you're passionate about. You don't owe the world Anything."

I don't like feminine clothes, nor do I enjoy makeup. Whenever I wear makeup  I always feel like I'm lying to myself. I know it sounds strange. 
Everything I do feels stilted and awkward like I'm an alien in a skin-suit. I'm surprised I made it this far (even though I have yet to accomplish anything). It kind of sucks because I am in a relationship with a guy, but I don't really feel right being intimate with him. I mean, I Do care about him; I just feel so out of place. He deserves better and I would totally understand him breaking up with me. Doesn't help that I'm short and fat with big boobs. Even when I was thin I felt ugly and out of place.

It seem like the only way to solve this is through introspection. I understand that other people have their own problems, and sometimes I feel ridiculous for expecting them to get it. I just try not to let it eat me alive. I don't want to be full of resentment and anger when I finally die. I know we're having our own experiences.
I still come to this Subreddit sometimes but I've been burned too many times. I don't want people to treat me too differently or feel sorry for me. The only way I know how to deal with stuff like this is to distract myself."
