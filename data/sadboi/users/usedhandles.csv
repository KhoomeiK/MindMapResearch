SuicideWatch,fqlwgxl,t3_gjnb4w,1589467340.0,"None of  us know what to say, though the resources at r/SWResources are quite good. 

The standard piece of advice, at least when I did my suicide intervention training, is all about active listening and acknowledging the validity of someone's feelings. It can sometimes also involve helping someone locating resources that they don't know about or don't have the  energy to seek out, but this should only happen after discussing with the person what they need. An example I used recently was asking a friend if he has ever done any CBT work  around his agoraphobia, and would he be willing to talk to me about the  possibility of my running exercises with him. The answers were ""no I haven't""  and ""no I don't want to."" Supporting him means listening to this and continuing to ask questions about alternative paths. Not insisting I know what the fix is. Because I don't. Because you don't. Because neither of us can. 

Validating a person's feelings can be really hard with something like suicidality, especially with someone you care about, when you want to convince them that they are ""wrong"" about  suicide being a/their better/ideal/only/last path. But, the pain undergirding the feelings of suicidality are real and merit attention.  

Remember that you are not responsible for this person's suicidality now, and you aren't responsible for their future actions. 

Continue to communicate care, listen (like, as in [active listening](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/active-listening.html)), and check-in with them about what they need. Set boundaries for yourself around what you can't do, even if they ask you for it. One of mine is, ""I won't help you die.""

PLEASE find someone that you can talk to about your own experiences of this along the way. It can/does take a lot of energy out of person to support a friend who is in so much pain. Reach out to other friends about how you are feeling about it. Call crisis lines about your own distress about this. Reach out on online places to talk with strangers about it. You will be better able to provide this person emotional support if you are also able to process your own feelings and needs around this. 

Take care. I'm glad that your friend has you."

SuicideWatch,fpvrlwu,t1_fpvokc1,1588950560.0,"I guess I'll say two things. The first is that my saying grades aren't a good indicator of student learning is not a ""fringe"" position. If you are interested, here is [one essay](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct94/vol52/num02/Making-the-Grade@-What-Benefits-Students¢.aspx) that looks at the benefits and failures of traditional grading in school from a teacher's perspective. It is absolutely true that grades can shape which university you go to, but that still isn't related to how smart you are. 

I remember feeling similarly when I was a student. It took until I started teaching to really come to value the contributions of students and how their learning developed across the semester, even if they got terrible grades. 

When students really struggle in classes, that doesn't mean the students are stupid. It means that the education system isn't working for them. If you do think you have a learning/intellectual disability of some kind, it is the responsibility of the school to help you. I really believe this. It might be worth contacting a school counsellor and asking about getting tested. Getting tested right now will be difficult because of COVID19, but I think it is worth waiting for. 

You don't have to believe the same things that I do, but for whatever it may be worth: I think the world would be a much worse place if we used any kind of an illness/disability (genetic or acquired) as a way of taking people out of the population. The word for thinking that only people with good genetics should live (and reproduce) is called eugenics. It was a really popular opinion between the 1880s and the 1940s, and it fell out of favour after WWII. We learned a lot of things from WWII about how we just can't decide what kinds of people are good for society based on their genes and which are bad for it. This is still true even as we learn more about genetics. 

If you got tested and you found out that you have a learning disability, that doesn't mean you are stupid and it doesn't mean that society would be better without you. It just means that traditional schooling wasn't built for you. It wasn't built for all kinds of very smart people. We don't have special education because we have ""dumb students"". We have special education because we think all students can thrive, some students just need accommodations to do that. Those accommodations help many students get better grades to help them keep moving forward. 

I'm sorry for rambling so much."

What that change will look like is completely unpredictable. What we are is made up of so many moving parts that we develop positively in some areas and struggle more than we used to in others. 

I do think it is possible to regain some of the character traits that  you admired about yourself as before. I don't think any of us can be the exact same as we've been before, because we live through new experiences and those change us. But that doesn't mean that swinging from happier to depressed puts you on a life course to depression or worsening depression.

Not everyone knows how to provide support to people in distress and experiencing suicidal thoughts. Sometimes  they fail us. It doesn't mean they don't care, it just means  they don't know what to do or say. How well someone handles being asked for  help has nothing to do with how that person feels about  the other person reaching out. It has to do with their own emotional intelligence and baggage around depression/mental illness/suicidality. When people handle this poorly, it makes asking for help harder and harder. 

I like to sometimes start with the question ""Are you up for talking about some heavy shit right now?"" And giving  them permission to leave the conversation if  they can't handle it. I also usually check-in if they are having an intense emotional response. 

I have friends that when reaching out to me can be very clear about their needs, ""I need to talk about something. You can't have a reaction. You can't freak out  or panic. I just need you to hear me."" Or, alternatively, ""I'm trying to understand something that's happening and I could use some help working  through it."" If you can detect a part of what you are looking  for in reaching out and communicating that it is more  likely you'll get that. And if the person can't give that to you with the boundaries that you've set,  then  you have  learned that this person might now be  able to help you in the way you need.

SuicideWatch,fprzob6,t3_gf7to8,1588865006.0,"Most of my coping strategies when shit gets dark have been about distraction to get me through the roughest parts of it. 

For me  music, like you said is one of my primary ones. I find music even more effective if I dance around to it because it makes it both mental and physical. 

I've never been good at meditating, but sitting and looking out the window and trying to really focus on everything I see happening outside it helps, this works even better for me if I write notes about what I am seeing, so I stay focused on what is happening outside me. 

Masturbating, for serious. It feels nice and takes my mind off of things; if I can't concentrate then I can cling to pornography to hold my focus. This usually treats masturbating as a fairly mechanical process, but one in which I am in my body and at least that is feeling nice. 

A friend does math puzzles, again, because it requires so much focus.  

I like other kinds of mental exercises. Like Like going through a dictionary and finding about 15 words I don't know and trying to memorize their definitions. 

There are some kinds of exercises around ""thought blocking,"" that took me a  really long time to hone. Like when one part of my mind wants to tell the other to shut up, instead of ""shut up"" I try and mentally say gentler things like ""that isn't  helpful right now"". Something that doesn't necessarily reject the negative thoughts (because that can be too hard sometimes), but tries of focus on  how useless the negative thoughts are. 

There is this premise in CBT that there is a relationship between being hard on the self and being hard on others. So I actually try to focus on something someone else did that upset me and try to re-narrate the moment with more  care for the other person than is intuitive to me. Like giving someone else more slack can help me better understand that I too need some slack. This requires the self-control to  not diminish the self at the same time, and that can be really hard. 

I also don't know if you have someone in your life with whom you could do this, but there is one person in the world with whom every now and then  we just write to each other saying, ""I could really use someone telling me not to die right now."" I feel so honoured to have that level of intimacy and acceptance from someone. This requires a particular kind of compatible-depression among friends. I get that not everyone has that. But I you know of other depressives in your life, this might be one possible avenue. 

I dunno if any of this will help, but I hope you know that the usefulness of particular coping mechanisms ebb and flow, and I hope you find something in responses here that can help right now when the video games and music isn't working well enough."

SuicideWatch,fnixdys,t1_fniwls6,1586988058.0,"I think that it could be possible to talk about the fear of failing without getting into the details of why you are afraid. This can be tricky. It might actually be the kind of thing that you practice answers to questions like: ""Well, why are you failing?"" or ""Is there anything going on at home?"" It makes a lot of sense that you are worried about what would happen to your family if the cops were involved. 

It might help to go to a teacher who you trust (whether or not you are doing well in their class) and tell them that you are worried about what will happen if you fail your classes and that you have spoken to a counselor already and they didn't help. A good teacher (but not all teachers are good teachers) would try to advocate for you with the school. I can't promise this will happen, but it might help to have a conversation with someone more on the ""education""-side."

You are under so much pressure right now. You are supporting a lot of people on top of doing high school. That is a lot for you to deal with. I definitely don't think that the only option after failing high school (and you haven't failed yet) is suicide. 

Have you spoken to any of your teachers at the school about how you are worried that you are going to fail. I don't know if the school will be able to do any kind of accommodation, but that teacher probably knows a lot more about coming back to school later or taking a part of the term off. I imagine there is someone at your school who can help talk to you about your options before the term is over that could stop you from failing. 

I know this will sound corny and weird, but people keep learning about things that they are good at after high school. High school is not the only place that you can discover and develop new skills."

I wonder, since you talked about your cousins changing and seeming like they are in a circumstance close to yours, if that might make them easier to talk to about this. Especially because it might be their chance to start articulating these feelings.

Also, your future is not defined by your parents. Parents make us and shape us, but we aren’t them. We are shaped by so many other things and we come to shape ourselves. I don’t think that struggling in high school means that you won’t find success."

To be kind isn't to get everything right and it isn't to predict everyone's needs and desires perfectly. It is to consider other people, and it definitely sounds like you are doing that.

It might be a dumb thing to say, but I hope that you keep trying. There is a real difference between finding a job and finding a career. I get that you are saying little of the work looks interesting or fulfilling. It is okay for the moment to broaden the net to work that helps you financially while you continue to look for more fulfilling work. 

I really do recommend setting up a kind of goal like that you will apply for # of jobs a day everyday. Even if you don't think that you are the most qualified. Even if you think it looks boring. Applying for work takes practice, it also has a real luck-of-the-draw factor. The more you put out there, the better your odds are. If you have anyone in your life that would be able to help you shape the resume and cover letter, I think that could also be helpful in terms of the ""practicing"" part of applying for work. 

It is easy to get discouraged when we can't find work, and not finding work is increasingly normal. Just try to remember that just because you applied for something and didn't get one job doesn't mean that you won't get a job. I'm cheering for you."

Reaching out to a family member who is also an abuser is not the same as siding with the abuser. When violence (sexual and otherwise) enters the domestic sphere, everyone in the family unit ends up with complicated emotions. 

It is okay that you missed your father and wanted that validation from him. It is okay to want someone to express love for you. I understand that your mother and sister are in so much pain that they might find that hard to accept, but that doesn't make your emotional needs less valid. 

If your anxiety is fixated on the court date (which probably won't happen for a while now with COVID) would it help if you brain stormed some of the ways that you could respond (either in court or privately) to what you are worried he might say?"
