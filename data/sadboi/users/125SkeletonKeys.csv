Her boyfriend has beat the shit out of her and his momma has dropped her off at my house so she doesn't have to deal with it. She's got a concussion, she says shes also taken GHB, xanax, and smoked a blunt, so it's worse. I have to take her to the ER because shes here. I was just trying tk smoke a little and have a nice night man... so on the way to the ER, she doesn't know who I am or where we are or anything, then shes struggling to breathe and gasping when she does. I get her there, she can't tell the nurse what year it is, she thinks its 2000. They check her out, she's fine for a bit, but then they find weed on her that she had in her clothes, so now shes freaking out thinking we're about to get arrested. I'm not riding with anything, but I have no idea what she has, and I don't want to deal with it. They also refuse to give her pain meds based on what shes taken, which is the last straw, even though she doesn't know what year it is, can't remember the doctor she just spoke to... but she wants to leave, she checks out AMA and gets belligerent. Now we have to fucking go or else the cops will be called. When we get to the car, I start calling more of her friends to see if anyone can help me. Now she's seriously fucked and paranoid. She thinks I've stolen her phone her money that I set her up... shes trying to get out of the moving car all the time. She manages to get out at a gas station and makes a fool of herself, and I'm told they will call the cops too. I know at this point that she has some kind of pills and GHB in her stuff in my car, and no thanks. Her friend says he'll get her a hotel room so she can chill and he will find some people to check on her throughout the day. 

Bruh. I was not high enough for that shit. 
I was just glad that dude helped me out because I could not have stopped her myself.

So, at this point I'm like "" ok, this girl will rat us out. She dipped out fast after she walked through on her phone. Old dude just got out of jail after one of her calls. He's here now. Shes still not pleased about that. She might call on all of us. Ok, I see other people are paranoid. I'm leaving"". So I was out of there. I usually don't mind other people's paranoia.

The rumor is, and he still won't really say anything other than ""he got fucked up"", but the rumor has it that someone gave him some bad shit and tried to kill him or fuck him up. He slammed most of his stuff, and he'd gotten to the point where he'd shoot in his neck where his work shirt hid any marks. There's the rumor that it fucked him up pretty bad, messed up his brain or something, and he's been secretly paranoid like that ever since, but his meds usually work. They say that he will go off his meds sometimes when he wants to get fucked up, so that's what makes his paranoia and delusions a lot worse. 

But, idk about all that. We used to be really close and talked about everything. I mean, we're still close enough that I don't mind him eating and sleeping at my house, but... I'd just rather not run the risk of him freaking out, so I definitely did not want him walking in and smelling it so freshly if you know what I mean. 

I should have put all of that in my OP, but I needed to be short because I needed to do many other things at the time, lol."
meth,ev0kg7w,t1_ev0h3pd,1564140740.0,"Well, my husband is my all the time roommate and he knows, he just doesn't want me smoking it around him. My temporary roommate is only here for roughly 3 more hours so he didn't have to pay for a hotel on his way to a job. He's alright and he's cool with everything, but he can not do meth, and if he knows I have it in the house (he thinks I smoked with a friend at their place) he will want to hit the pipe. Which wouldn't be a problem if he didn't go from 0-12,000 real fucking quick. The last few times I got high with him, he goes from fine, to getting deep in his feelings, to extremely paranoid (to the point where he has hurt himself and hurt someone else) in completely unpredictable time frames. Sometimes, he'd be fine for 12 hours before he freaked out. Sometimes it was 12 minutes. Sometimes, it's nothing minor. Like, he'll hallucinate that a dog is chasing him and it looks mean. Sometimes, he pops out of his bedroom with a loaded gun and goes and squats in the front door saying that he's going to shoot the next red car that rides by because he knows they're paying people in red card to watch him... and we have to tell him to calm down, don't fire a gun in city limits, the cops will come out here and no one wants that... and he puts it down like nothing happened. Sometimes, he just kind of gets mad that he never hooked up with me when he had the chance and he wished he hadn't waited so long because he loves me... and sometimes it's all of the above. Or only some of the above.  I don't want him hurting himself or anyone else, so it's better that he didn't know it was here while he was here. 


Either way, he doesn't need to do any meth while he's here. He doesn't know its here and he wont know its here."

I think I've figured out that as long as I give myself 10 minutes before anyone comes home or 5 minutes and spray a little febreeze, nobody should be able to notice. Plus, it makes me feel better about it. 

I don't worry about the smell at all when I smoke in my garage. It's just something I worry about in the bathroom. I will sit in my broke down car in the garage and smoke in there with windows rolled up, get up to grab a drink, and in the 15 seconds that takes, my car just smells like stale cigarettes which is how it has smelled for the last 9 years."
meth,ev0epo7,t1_euye4ng,1564137101.0,"I find that weed makes me feel more paranoid, and in an uncontrollable way. On meth, I tend to just be extra  cautious with things and worry about stuff that I shouldn't. At least with meth, I can get myself to step away from what I'm worrying about and deal with it later. Like today. I knew my husband and roomie (the roomie is temporary) would be home within 5 minutes. I'd been worrying about the smell for the previous 20 minutes that I smoked. Since I knew it would look less odd if I were on the back porch smoking a cigarette than in the bathroom spraying febreeze everywhere, I was able to get myself to spray a little in the bathroom, spray a little in the adjoining bedroom, and then put everything away and leave the bathroom."
meth,ev0e85r,t1_euz587e,1564136754.0,"Sounds like a good plan that I hadn't thought of. 

I mean, I know I worry over nothing. It's like when I'm high, my brain can't separate the smell of meth sweats and the smell of meth clouds. I know my sweat is rancid when I'm high, so I tend to take as many showers as I can during the day. I guess I've sort of trained my brain to equate meth and the bathroom into smelling bad, so I think it smells more than it does. It's also my main paranoia. I don't worry about my eyes or eye contact. I've only been noticed at work and in public by other users, and they only notice because I'm sweating more than anyone else is even though it's hot out. 

I sat down with my stepdad (who did 31 years in law enforcement) and my lawyer after a 3 day binge and neither of them could tell or smell anything on me, and I'd literally just left a friend's apartment, drove 5 minutes away to meet them, and didn't have time to smoke a cigarette before I had to get out and sit next to them. My lawyer asked me what perfume I was wearing because she liked it . I'd grabbed a quick shower, thrown my hair into a bun, and sprayed a little perfume on my hair since I didn't have time to wash it, and that was it. Nobody noticed anything but the perfume I wore. And I only spritzed maybe one spray in my hair. 

That doesn't mean I can make my paranoid brain understand that though. Sober, I'm all about logic and skepticism. High? Maybe that garbage truck really is working for the FBI and they're watching me(not really, but you know what I'm saying about getting stuck on one thing). I just get extra cautious when I'm high. Triple check to make sure I didn't send that text to my boss, triple check that I sent that snapchat to the right person and not my nephew... browse absolutely everything in incognito mode just in case I forget and google something incriminating..."

I definitely need to take a long break. This is the first time I've gone this hard with it and I'm paying for it now. Usually, I'd binge for 2-4 days every few months and not touch it. Before this year, it had been 10 years since I'd used it last. Did it again in like, March or April, and left it alone until July. I've used just about every day this month with maybe 3 days off. The comedown is shit. It's been a while since I've had a comedown like this, so I definitely have to lay off for now. 

I enjoy it more when it's something I treat myself to instead of going balls to the wall daily."
StimSisters,eucikvx,t1_eucgspu,1563676140.0,"I noticed that with Trazadone too. First night, 25 mg knocked me out, but soon I needed 50 mg, then 100 mg. Now, I'm up to 200 mg too, and it still doesn't really work. The higher in dose that I go, the worse the nightmares are. The Trazadone just recently got to the point where it wouldn't knock me out anymore, but I've heard a lot of people say that they were only able to take it for a few months before it stopped working, even if they didn't take it every night. It worked for me and then it just didn't anymore.

I've been predominantly snorting too. My nose is fucked right now though, so it's break time. I had to stock up on my nose spray. The next time I use, I'm going to be smoking or eating it. I love snorting way too much but my nostrils start to really hate it by day 3."

I really need to see if my doctor will prescribe me something different for sleep. My therapist knows about my drug use, so they've only ever given me belsorna and trazadone to help me sleep. Belsorna does fuck all and the trazadone either works fine, doesn't work at all, or gives me horrible, lucid nightmares that I can't wake myself out of. There's no telling what will happen if I take it. When I get the nightmares, I've slept, but it's not restful, good sleep."
Drugs,euachxl,t1_euableq,1563611211.0,"You're for real working yourself into a frenzy. They say people with panic disorder and the like should avoid the medicine because some of the side effects can cause restlessness and nervousness, which can lead to a person having a panic attack, sort of like what's happening with you right now. 

I'm in college, studying a medical field; I've done rotations in hospitals, pharmacies, and I had to learn a lot about medications, side effects, interactions, everything like that. 

So I can say with some degree of certainty that you are fine. 

You should put on some Bob Ross or some other chill, calming video or music. Put a cold rag on your forehead, lie down, and take a few deep breaths. 

You will be fine. As long as you stop freaking yourself out."
Drugs,euac425,t3_cfja5n,1563610650.0,"Ok, even with tablespoons, you're still ok. 1 tablespoon equals 3 teaspoons, so 15 mL. You took around 75 mL then. If you follow the dosing instructions on the label, a kid taking it as directed, would have taken 60 mLs of it. 


You're feeling spacey because it's DXM. As far as the other ingredients, you aren't exactly close to reaching maximum daily doses. 

Take a deep breath, relax, get some sleep. 
You're fine. You're going to be fine."

Trazadone, clonidine, valerian root, and 3.5 hours of sex that actually ended up breaking the wooden slats on our bed frame, and I still only managed to get about 2 hours total of sleep. I'd only gotten about 3 hours the night before that. But the sleep I did get was interrupted and not restful. I'd doze for maybe 10-15 minutes and jerk awake, and then I'd be wide awake again, so I'd have to wind down again, repeat indefinitely...

I have always had issues with food, but now it's gone from one extreme to the next. I have to have the Soylent otherwise I don't eat for days.

It helps that he has a lot of the same traits I do as far as lack of emotion and general disregard for others, but he does feel remorse and guilt. Somehow, we've made it work. And as far as what I mean as far as regard is concerned is that I don't consciously lie, or manipulate them, and for others, I maintain the effort to appear more ""normal"". I attempt to react the way that's expected. I still don't feel bad about it when I do slip and do something wrong, but there is an attempt. 

I admit that I didn't really let the mask come off until we'd been together a long time. He and my therapist are still the only people in my real life that know that my diagnosis is being changed from bipolar to ASPD. But, I did lie to my therapist for a while too, which is why I ended up with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder in the first place. One day, I was fed up with the charade and told her that I was always like this, that this is how I've always been. We haven't completely decided that that's what we want to list on the medical chart, but, I've been told that I was probably a sociopath when I was younger, before I knew how to hide it from other people. We have to ""look into this more"" and ""reevaluate your charts"" according to the therapist."

So, I have to definitely be normal in front of my mom and my stepdad... but my stepdad is also a retired cop, so that's cool. Everything is fine... 

I at least have to take a break from snorting. My nose is already so fucked up and this is not helping. Day 1 was fine snorting, slight burn but ok. By day 3, it burns like hell and I'm seeing some blood when I wipe my nose out. Every time I go out and smoke with friends, I say I'm going to get me a pipe, but then we got high and I get either paranoid or forgetful. 

I mean, I really should take a break for at least 2 or 3 days anyway and actually put down some real food. I only want to live on fruit and Soylent or Ensure these days. But I already lose my appetite in the summer. Add the meth and well, I'm definitely not going to want to consume any nutrient based product without a reminder on my phone."

Probably going to go get a pipe before my next spin session before I get high and forget to get my own. 

Smoking just doesn't get me as high as I want to he, doesnt last as long, and I feel like the comedown is more noticeable and drastic when smoking compared to other ROAs. I also feel the need to constantly hit the pipe. With snorting, the burn makes sure that I take a few minutes between lines.
