The parent may not have access to affordable health care to get the child professional treatment and a diagnosis. Therapy can be upwards of $200 a session AFTER insurance, if the family can even afford to be insured or is offered adequate insurance by their workplace that would cover any mental health treatment in the first place. Going into bankruptcy, or debt and/or getting garnished isn’t going to help at all. 

In this case, the parent needs to do the best they can, take a look and evaluate a self dx. Is it ideal? No. Of course not. But that may be the only thing they can do UNTIL they can get the child help.
