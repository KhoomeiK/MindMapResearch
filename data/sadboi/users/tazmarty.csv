SkincareAddiction,f03ef92,t1_f03cyiy,1568353467.0,"Hey! I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre aware, and I mean this with all due respect- but the term spirit animal refers to practices and traditions that are unique to certain Indigenous beliefs. By continuing to use the phrase we become a part of the cultural appropriation of Indigenous culture, one that looks to exploit and erase the realities of their people. 

I paraphrased [this](https://www.spiralnature.com/spirituality/spirit-animal-cultural-appropriation/) article, it‚Äôs a really cool read if you‚Äôre interested. 

If you‚Äôre Indigenous yourself I apologize in advance, I‚Äôm only trying to spread the info to those who might not otherwise be aware."

There are so many green and currently ripening little tomatoes, along with a couple of heirloom varieties, and I can‚Äôt wait for them all to turn. I made a few mistakes as a novice (over-fertilized when potting, not enough air circulation when they grew, under watered during heat waves‚Äî leading to blossom end rot and powdery mildew), however I was lucky enough to have a few experienced veg gardening friends and groups that helped me learn a lot. I‚Äôm really excited for future gardens, hopefully I‚Äôm able to expand and grow more varieties with larger yields!!"
