UpliftingNews,fq1961o,t1_fq1189g,1589043438.0,"I can see how it would mess up a kid for sure. But how is it harmful for say a man in his late 30's who in not comfortable having same sex attractions? I don't ask to be contrarian or because I'm stirring shit. I ask because I can see how people confronting their sexuality later in life could find it to be disordly to their life. I don't know what Im asking exactly. Is it harmful because the nature of suppressing one's sexuality ia harmful, or is it harmful due to methodology? Specifically concerning consenting adults?"

 Many of us have had long periods of functionality where we believe we are cured and many of us have been proven wrong during times of acute stress. As people who have experienced psychosis first hand I am surprised to see you endorsing a person with possible psychosis in office."

I was physically dependent on that drug for years and getting off of it almost killed me several times over. I'm talking about the physical withdrawals coming close to ending my life. Tianeptine is an SSRE as well as a mu opioid agonist. It's a much harder detox than heroin and 30g a week is a MASSIVE amount considering the actual dose is 12.5mg 3x per day. At a gram a day you are so far over the recommended dose that you likely already know how hopelessly addicted you are.
