bulimia,fj4nzm2,t3_fb87dj,1583012735.0,What helped was to take everything one minute at a time. Whenever I got the urge I set a timer for 15 mins and just sit with everything (easier said than done). I hope that helps a bit just remember take things slow and give yourself grace <3
relationships,fj4kutu,t3_fbclnn,1583010623.0,Okay to put in perspective i see my boyfriend more in a month than you have in 8 months of dating major red flags!!
DoesAnybodyElse,fiwajp8,t3_f9ydm5,1582779497.0,Yes! But the most satisfying thing is when the song ends exactly when you pull into the driveway
amIuglyBrutallyHonest,fis0335,t1_firw9zf,1582674726.0,"115 pounds is chubby? I don’t believe in BMI but if you calculate it, it’s literally not even close to being overweight! I usually don’t comment on this sub but I can’t sit back and not reply to something so dumb that can also lead or feed into an eating disorder."
BipolarReddit,fileudz,t1_filchhc,1582499990.0,PHP- partial hospitalization IOP- intensive outpatient program! Basically different levels of care in a program facility!

fasting,fen3bjs,t1_fen03o7,1579276039.0,"Are you serious? Citation? What about common sense? It’s a health trend like most diets, it’s in right now.  Fasting and trying to control your body isn’t in the long run effective! Also you still did answer my question! What happens next? When does it stop? Do you really wanna live your whole life like I mean up to you. As someone who has talked to many RDs and all can agree but hey slow your metabolism down and regain the weight from something you literally can’t physically maintain :^)"
fasting,femfpg2,t3_epojwg,1579253100.0,Hate to break it to ya but there is research PROVEN to show that people who do this (I’m sorry for calling it this but honestly not) yo-yo diet end up gaining all the weight if not more. What happens after? When does it end? You’re killing your metabolism. If you ask any registered dietitian not just a nutritionist they will agree how detrimental this is.

relationships,f2iw5j5,t3_ddkews,1570263591.0,In my honest opinion it seems like he is cheating! I would talk to him as soon as possible and just be blunt. It is not normal for someone to still have a dating app on their phone while seeing someone!
