Croteam,ermaycp,t3_c2gq9q,1561013260.0,"So I live in a third world country and back in 2006, a Computer was super expensive, even without an internet connection. The most basic of models costed around $400. Therefore it was rare to see a computer in every household as we see these days. 

One day, My dad walked into a store and bought a spanking new PC. It came with an AMD Sempron clocked at 1Ghz, 128 MB of DDR1 RAM and an MSI K8MM-V with a 64MB S3/VIA Unichrome IGP graphics. For storage it had a Samsung PATA 80GB hard disk, a basic CD ROM drive and a shiny 3.5 inch floppy disk drive. The Computer came out of the box with the shiny ""new"" Windows XP and this was back when every office computer still ran Windows 2000. I had a blast playing games such as Road Rash and Need For Speed 2 and the 64MB IGP proved more than able to run these games.

Fast forward two years. On my birthday, My cousins gifted me a copy of ""Pack5 - Action Games"" and one of the 5 games that the bundle had was ""Serious Sam : The First Encounter"". After dinner, I popped the CD in the computer and was instantly greeted by the low res splash screen of Karnak.

*Sam I AM*

The moment I heard those words, I knew I was in for a good time. I used to spend hours upon hours playing the game. I remember that I used to skip the ""Tomb of Ramses"" level because I was a total wimp and couldn't play through it. My favourite level however was Luxor and imo Luxor is one of the high points in TFE. 

The best feature in TFE was Split Screen. I could invite all my friends for an all out cooperative adventure. We made control schemes for all three of us on the same PS/2 keyboard. These meetups and coop sessions continued for several years! 

The downside of the game was of course, the only one Deathmatch map. To combat this issue, I started playing around with the world editor added other structures and places to desert temple. Initial efforts of making these modifications to the level included having one light source with its area set to a very large amount so it can illuminate every structure I built. Eventually I figured out how things worked and how I could make better things in World Editor. By the time I managed to snag a copy of The Second Encounter, I had managed to build Several floating castles with towers that ascended into the sky. I eventually ported over my version of Desert temple into The Second Encounter and even added a meteor shower at the edges of the world to prevent people from wandering off too far. Towards the end of my high school years, I'd found a copy of ""Serious Sam Editor - tips and tricks"" on the internet (I think it was Seriously! Not sure)  - a help file with handy notes on every entity that was available in editor and built a Deathmatch level from scratch using the world editor from the Second Encounter. It was  buggy at first with people being able to clip through the walls but we loved playing that level for hours on end. 

I'm now in college and just bought a copy of Serious Sam 3 yesterday in the midweek madness sale. I manged to convince my friends to purchase it too as it was hardly $2.
We're looking forward to a great co-op campaign together over the weekend. 

Thank you Croteam for a memorable childhood!"
