landscaping,fp2v44q,t1_fp2khbs,1588268393.0,Was also going to suggest this. I have a similar situation in my side yard and have had plans to do this for some time.
lawncare,fove9me,t3_g9q8xj,1588099860.0,"Many many years ago worked for a short time at TruGreen. They offer some great programs to revamp the yard. In my area though, there are better deals to be had. We have some smaller businesses around.. one called Weed Man (not joking) that is growing in size and seems to be cheaper. Another I worked for in town was called NatureScape and was much more affordable all around. 

I would Google those two companies to start depending on your location. If they're not around and no other company exists there to do this kind of work it comes down to how much time you want to invest. 

Having TruGreen do the lawn is extremely easy and they're professional. You're getting the right applications at about the right times. There are always going to be horror stories out there. Those are the stories that will always stick out further than the positive ones. TruGreen I know will also back their work. If you're not happy they either reapply, or refund. Either way your results are guaranteed.

On the flip side, I love doing my own lawn work. It takes time and know how to become familiar with the very specific issues in the lawn but that's what this place is for, to ask. Also, most big box stores or online stores sell products that are designed to be easy to use for home owners. Most actually have multiple ingredients for multiple issues.(fert, weed killer, fungicide or insecticide maybe). 

I would suggest keeping a log of all the applications and things you do the the yard, and you can start to hone in exactly what your yard needs or doesn't. As the year goes on. Also, better to start soon before crabgrass takes off. If you want to do any overseeing or aerating I would suggest planning those for fall. Those two things are the absolute quickest way to get a full lawn. You'll be amazed.

Best of luck with your decision!"

Now that goes with saying.. I would absolutely switch companies if a week after the 2nd spray they still aren't looking curly anywhere. If you have crabgrass anywhere be sure to bring that up that you're worried about it when calling. If it gets another month to go unchecked this spring it will be much harder to kill through the year."
