I think you need a to talk to a (couples) therapist and maybe get documentation about him being a narcissist.

However, this is clearly affecting your mental health. If you are not seeing a therapist,  I suggest you find one. How's he feel about marriage counseling? 
Just from reading this, it seems like he's letting illness dictate how he treats you and to me it's toxic af. That's not how you treat your partner. 

Good luck and I hope you find what you need."

It sounds like there is still quite a bit of trauma you need to work through. Are you seeing a therapist in addition to meds? If not, I strongly suggest it. It sounds like there might some post partum in there too.
As for unruly kids, I can only imagine the frustration. Have you thought about taking a parenting class? I don't ask because I think you're a bad mom, but maybe they might have strategies that can help you feel more in control. 
I seriously wish you all the best. You're an incredibly strong person and the fact that you reached out in the first place proves that."
