I don't know the context of the story, but ""the next best"" usually refers to the second-best choice when the first choice is not a valid option.

sleep,fffwnfs,t3_et6dw9,1579893425.0,"My understanding of the sleep process is quite crude, but my general understanding is that your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rushes into your brain to remove waste and resupply needed chemicals. Your brain also uses sleep to processes that days memories, decide what information to keep and what to throw away, and organize your emotions. So, in my very unprofessional opinion, doing one night of an extra hour or two could help, but after that your brain chemicals should be all balanced up and what damage is done is done as far as emotions/memory, so just get the recommended 7-9 hours."
