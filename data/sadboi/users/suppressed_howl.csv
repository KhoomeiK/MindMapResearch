I sneaked away to play on the field. The sports teacher caught me and was sent to the principal's office. Well, corporal punishment still wasn't prohibited back then so I got some good time in there. Funny thing is when I was asked to go back to class, I again went away somewhere else and sneakily roamed around the school until school got over."

My family was always nice and supportive, that's what I felt because I never failed until when I did. Losing a couple of years in college and here it is. My younger sister is the worst, she's those entitled kinda shit person. It was okay back then because she could brag about her brother's accomplished but since I have been failing. She's is talking shit to me like how I am just wasting our parents money and that I am just a lazy useless person. Now, all I think about is getting better and get independent.

A little failures here and there but mostly there is progress in all those things, with still a long way to go. Except, I can't make use of my brain as I used to. It feels like I am dumb. No matter how hard I try, read it, write it down, say it out loud, multiple times. It's like my brain is retaining nothing. Sometimes, I read a sentence and feel like what did I just read, and have to put effort on every single word to understand what that sentence mean. It's weird. So at times either, it feels like whatever I read is just bouncing off my head and not getting in or it's going straight through like water through a sieve. This is what's stopping me from getting better, study is the top most priority but I am not able to do that. Hence, failing exams and going nowhere."

 True, they are like, just pass this and that and then everything is set and boast about its perks. The thing is it will always be like this. This is what adulting is like, I guess. You give yourself little quality time and then back to work. It will never be how it used to be in school, free from all work because you completed all your pending work. There will always be something pending. So, try to concentrate on what you do at the moment, work hard play hard, I suppose.
 I used to think like that too,'only if I could start over again' but we know that's impossible, so try to make use of the present. Easier said then done. That's the only option though.
It's a big leap when you get into college. We are never taught how to manage and handle things and had no prior exposure, especially if you have overprotective and conservative parents. Only thing I can tell you is, don't let anything mess up your priority, study and pass exams. It's a mess on that side, telling from experience."

depression,fg4mabb,t3_eubewa,1580506247.0,"That's pretty much how my life is. I am in my final year of medical college. Already have 2 year lags. I was good in studies and motivated in school. Got into a medical college because it seemed like a good idea since that's all I have ever studied to be and more so pressure from parents. First year was okay, after that it all went downhill. Got an year lag in second year and then in final year which I am trying to pass but failing to prepare for it. I don't have friends because the people I made friends with in first year weren't the ones I want to be with and moreover, they all passed the exams and went ahead. My second and third year is more like a memory that I can't remember because there was nothing to remember. In a room, with an old laptop, rewatching movies and series, playing that same game and porn because I wanted to stopping the negative thoughts in my head. That was the worst time. Since then I have been trying to get things better. Can't really talk to my parents about it because they did everything right but I don't know where I messed up. And they are conservative so, can't just say that I might have depression. I have controlled watching porn, almost don't watch it anymore. Tried to get some exercise which is on and off. Bad eating habits is still an issue which goes on and off with exercise. The most important thing which I am failing at is studying for exam because I can't focus and it just isn't getting in my head. Brain fog(?) Other than that no friends, tried to meet someone but with my state that wasn't possible. And so on. So I am gonna end it here.
Honestly, there is nothing that I can tell you that you don't know about what you should do to get better. It's just that we are not able to do it due to one reason or another."

All this until I pass out because I couldn't sleep when I wanted, too much was going on in the head. I kinda waited for the storm to go away for a bit. It was an year and a few months of constant pain. Been 2 years now still working on myself. The storm is gone, I can try to control my mind. Kicked lots of bad habits during that time, like PMO addition, bad eating habits(food to distract and comfort my mind), browsing Internet mindlessly. Since then I have made lots of progress but I still have things to do to get my life in place because it's still shit, failing exams and more.
I would say sit the storm out. You can't do anything with your mind doing this shit. And when you feel a bit okay. Take one task at a time. Slow and steady progress. It's not gonna improve in a day or a month. When you will be conquering these little battles. People won't notice that and say you are not even trying and are useless but they don't know. Have patience, kick one problem at a time in it's butt. And if it helps remember that there are people who have it worse than us, that doesn't invalidate our problems, rather tells us we can make it work for ourselves too. Take care."

Washing dishes, cleaning house, maybe workout or just making bed. Heck maybe just have a glass of water every morning at the same time. And when you take care of that and start working on your study or job where you need to use you brain more, you will see that you can't perform like you used to. Infact, you will be pretty bad. Your brain will be slow, foggy, won't retain or understand info much. Don't let that disappoint you. Whenever you feel bad about this remember how you worked yourself and the progress on getting outta your bed and do chorus and stuff. Now, people will tell you different learning or memorising techniques. Different ones work for different people. But the thing is non will work for you. Why? Because too much is going on in your head. Meditation helps. It basically is clearing your mind, calming it and taking the control. That helps a lot. You will see it will better your focus, those random crowd of thoughts will go away slowly or slow down enough for you to concentrate on the work you are doing.

AskReddit,f7j5p7p,t1_f7h6n8r,1573771160.0,Didn't feel the fear but I woke up with a sensation as if the fingertip of ring finger of my right hand got crushed by a hammer. And saw this giant rat run across the room. It drew first blood(literally) and I finished the job. I killed it with slippers and got myself rabies shots.
