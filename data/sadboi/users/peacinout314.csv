If you guys can get through stuff like this together you can do anything! And I'm not exaggerating. Sending strength you guys this way and I hope that things calm down for you. I'm also pregnant delivering in about 3 or 4 weeks, covid-19 has been such a huge stress on top of this being that it's our first baby as well.

we are having a virtual shower this Sunday, and I can't help but feel it would have been more excited for a more traditional shower.

I'm still kind of freaking out because I don't know what we have yet until Sunday and then with my due date being May 26th I'm worried that we've still won't get everything in time.

The decorations were to use for the shower are sitting in our basement family room (where I get to look at them üôÑ) and while I am thankful to have a shower at all given the circumstances, I don't feel excited for it most days, just sad.

Normally I probably wouldn't be AS panicked as I am, but I'm 30 weeks pregnant so it's making baby planning much more uncontrollable than it already is.

For example, I'd wrecked my car pretty badly about 4 years ago. Fortunately I came out of it virtually unscathed. I'd been alone until neighbors who heard the noise came outside. They naturally became panicked seeing my car on it's roof, but I was cool as a cucumber, just sitting in someone's front yard on the phone with 911 to tell them what had happened and where I was at.

Again, I was luckily no more hurt than some bruising and cuts from broken glass (even those weren't very bad at all), so maybe that was part of it. I was also a bit dazed which I'm sure kept my anxiety down. I never did get driving anxiety afterwards either. To this day I can't believe how calm I was that late afternoon yet I struggle to do things like go to the store by myself some days."

Most days I walk around mentioning to people that ""I can't take it.""

I feel like literally everything is out of my control. And while my husband points out that life is like that, and he is not wrong, it doesn't help that it feels like every little thing I've planned and I finally started to feel like I was getting somewhere with getting us organized and on track that this derailed everything 2 months before our due date.

it also doesn't help that we are first time parents and have never done this before in that in and of itself is stressful.

I could go on and on, work is restructuring, one of my dog's has Cushing's disease and I don't think that we can afford his medication for it, we are pushing my shower back and I'm afraid I won't end up with one at all. Yes I know we can do something with the baby after she is born, but I really had hoped for that experience and anticipation of her birth.

Metalcore,fhzak1e,t1_fhy02bm,1581994667.0,Right? It'll keep things fresh and pretty interesting I think.
mentalhealth,fhyz0e4,t3_f5d79v,1581987059.0,"If you can, check around local colleges and see if any offer therapy with students. Students studying to become therapists need to complete so many hours of field work per semester, and usually at a very low cost. 

I went to a student for nearly a year at my alma mater, she was wonderful at what she did and I only paid $10 per hour without any insurance necessary. I'm sure that again, since these are students, that a program could work some financial plan out for you considering your circumstances."
Narcolepsy,fhktaun,t1_fhkpqk0,1581690844.0,I slept through my follow-up to my sleep study and had to wait another month for the results. I literally told the doctor about that when I finally got to the follow up and pointed out how it demonstrated my need to be there üòù
pregnant,fhhxyvf,t1_fhgwfju,1581613958.0,"Thank you for sharing with me!!! As first time parents, I really feel having a doula there will be wonderful support for us both, especially if one or both of us gets all worked up in a counterproductive manner."
pregnant,fhhc9v6,t1_fhh1ej2,1581600606.0,"I'm very glad to hear for you that it was so much better the second time around! But frustrated for you regarding your first. It's tough and scary no matter if you're a first, second, third, etc. time mom and I really feel having a doula there is the personal support many many women could use during the toughest parts of their labor. 

It seems like most women (from what I've read) hit a point somewhere during labor where they feel like they absolutely cannot go on or handle it anymore. I'd really like to go my whole labor without an epidural because I want to lessen the likelihood that I receive intervention and I want to be able to feel when to push, not be told when.

I really appreciate your input, stories like yours are why I'm confident that a doula makes a difference!!!"
pregnant,fhgk5vn,t1_fhggnmv,1581569393.0,"Riiiight! Thank you! Again, I'm just bad at verbally defending myself, but think if it comes up again with anyone else, I'll voice my opinion similarly to the way you have here.
I don't know these nurses nor how they interact with patients. I've known my doula for years and I know she is going to be kick ass to have there with me!"
pregnant,fhgk2bp,t1_fhgimw7,1581569311.0,"I can see where your coming from! I think I am an analytical person at times but at the end of the day I am very emotionally driven. I think that's how I know I'm so certain that I DO want a doula with me.

I think you did all of the right things thinking it over. You've considered how you would react to that type of support and talked to your doctor about it. I think that if you are very comfortable with your doctor and confident in his/her views and considerations, it's safe to say he/she has a solid experience in how these nurses behave and interact with mothers in labor. Your doctor works with them day to day after all :)"
pregnant,fhg7xgq,t1_fhg6bc1,1581560637.0,Thank you very much for sharing your input! I'm having a hard time verbally defending my position but I know it's the right decision for me. You've worded it perfectly and covered all of the same feelings I've been having about it! My doctors are also supportive of me having a doula so that is helpful too :)
pregnant,fha1a9k,t3_f21el7,1581394551.0,Literally needed this right now. Came on here because I'm lying on my bed mentally panicking because there is so much to consider and I'm due in like 3 months. Thank you for bringing up the positives noatter how tough things get ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
