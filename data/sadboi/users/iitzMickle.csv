depression,fg2zkv5,t1_fg2yj3n,1580463194.0,Yeah I honestly never realised the effect it would have until today. I ended up in hospital last year because I considered doing it myself but my ex called the police on me when I asked her if she could take care of my cat  lol tbh the cats probably the only reason I’m even still here.

depression,feqd0gl,t1_feqbq8i,1579340279.0,Yeah it's not easy.
depression,feqb0mx,t1_feqa6i4,1579339605.0,"Yeah it's hard. I just feel like because I moved around so often I never really settled and made that group of friends that you belong to that always want you around. I just kind of have heaps of friends who I'm kind of a fringe friend they know me but yeah
I hope you start feeling better soon too"
depression,fbzq268,t3_ef4960,1577255905.0,Merry Christmas. Hope being around your family makes you feel better. You're stronger than you think
gameofthrones,eo86bj4,t3_bcalon,1558358564.0,I'd love to see it made in a GTA style open world but with the choices to choose your house etc like in Skyrim and do missions related to your house goals. Where you aren't just main characters like Jon Snow etc
