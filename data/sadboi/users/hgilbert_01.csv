Swordigo - Completely free, a platforming adventure game that involves a sword-wielding character traversing 2.5D environments in a fantasy world, gains magic spells along the way. RPG elements are present, they are pretty simple and don't hinder on the platformer's pace. Boss battles can be hard, but still good fun

Sword of Xolan - Similar to Swordigo, but this one is more level-based. It's a grand adventure like Swordigo, but still involves platforming goodness along with fighting monsters

Suzy Cube - A surprisingly stellar 3D platformer- at a cost: $4.99 I think, but it controls really well and has good levels, I'd highly recommend it. It's basically Super Mario 3D Land reskinned

Sonic 1, 2, and CD are all avaliable... I think they're all for free... I'm not sure. I know that you have to pay like $2.99 each to get rid of ads and othet limitations

Oh yeah, Sega has a lot of games for mobile

Other recommendations - Alto's Adventure and Alto's Odyssey are actually pretty fun- yes, techncially ""endless runners"", but there's a complexity that can be created from the simple control scheme and they are pretty relaxing to play actually"

Life,fklhlpk,t3_fikn1e,1584306468.0,"This is very understandable. I have a rather signficant struggle with anxiety, so I find myself always needing to be occupied with an activity. I tend to avoid wanting to spend time introspecting on my thoughts, as my anxiety creates something of a blackhole of thoughts...

To carry on the black hole analogy... Imagine I have a spaceship straight out of Star Wars or something like that, I have my thrusters constantly going, regularly filling them with the fuel that is hobbies and activities. The important thing here is that I never truly escape, I'm more or less just slowing down the event of the black hole eventually crushing me. If I lessen my thrusters, thus, lessen my engagement with activities, then I'll be pulled in and crushed much more quickly by my anxiety.

At this rate, I find myself at my absolute happiest when I am engaged in a hobby and passion- and it's not always super busywork, like I'll relax with video games, movies/TV shows, books, and even some fiction writing. The interesting thing about the fiction bit is that I tend to get anxious when moments in the movie slow down to explore the drama and outright address its more thematic purposes, like I'm more engaged with films that have action (not mindless Bayformer nonsense with infinite explosions and literally throwing the camera all over the place to create *tension*), but there needs to be some tangible actions going on. That way, I can find myself relating to onscreen events as the characters are at their happiest being engaged with their passions.

This is not to suggest that I never introspect; sense I can't really do it on my own, I rely on journaling. I absolutely adore the crap out of writing (whether it be electronically, such as typing this post right now on Reddit or using a pen/pencil on paper) - In fact, I plan on my major in college being English with an emphasis on Writing; that is if my school can email my degree to me electronically with the coronavirus shutting everything down (joke's not original, semi-influenced by someone else). Going back to the spaceship analogy, journaling is like special tools I have on my ship that can modify the movements of my thrusters to move with a little bit more control in the black hole. Of course, these tools eventually run out of power and need to recharge every now and then.

So yeah, my anxiety pushes me to be constantly engaged with hobbies. My therapist told me that distractions are good - but she only said with the context of what I have discussed with her being good. And yeah, I very strongly recommend that people start carrying a journal if they have difficulty trying to maneuver in their own black holes as it will make traversing the onslaught of thoughts a little easier."

IdiotsInCars,fjuc2ek,t3_fes1uu,1583615462.0,"This actually reminds me of something... My girlfriend and I, we were taking a long roadtrip to move to a college that we are both now attending. We were on a road that is basically an interstate exit ramp transitioning into... I don't know the term, I going to use ""city streets""-  by that, I don't mean big metropolitan area, but rather the technical city that the exit leads into. Anyway- there was this great big line of stopped cars as one was stopped at the first light following the exit ramp. Someone got impatient and decided to take an extremely risky move and illegally passed like the (around) fifteen stopped cars on an opposite travel lane (now that I think about- it was probably a little ways further from the exit ramp than I was initially hinting at). Likewise to the video, the driver's luck turned against them as they were intending to make a left turn on the intersection with the light, but couldn't as the green light changed and traffic was moving again. Our patience payed off and we were able to go before the impatient driver, left behind to wait for a chance to turn...

introvert,fju66c3,t3_fezgex,1583613900.0,"This... Thus is relatable to the most significant level. I absolutely agree. I too revel in being home. Thank you for bringing up the point of not needing to have an obligation to anyone, this is so important... Something I feel that is neglected too often about introverts is that socializing is literally work- actually, sorry- I can only speak for myself... Being obligated to engage socially with others is such a trial of endurance. I am literally at my maximum, functional when reveling in the solitude of home. 

The best thing is... Do I feel as if I am stuck at home? Not necessarily- because as long as I have access to books, televised media, video games, etc. - I'll have fictional adventures to take.

Not to say that I don't go outside as not going out for too would likely be hazardous for my health. But the again... People are out there too... Hmm...

I much prefer the development and focused time spent with characters introduced from the beginning. Such as Lost for example, I prefer time spent with one of the originals, such as Locke or Sawyer... Wasn't much interested in the characters later introduced."

introvert,fj7qxjb,t3_fbq18b,1583096335.0,"To further add to my... ...ramblings (*sigh*, sorry)- I feel like there's an expectation that is leveled towards introverts that isn't really recriprocated by extroverts. I am expected to meet a balance in communication in which a ""duty"" is bestowed upon me to fill in the silence- even when I don't necessarily see the silence as awkward. 

Like, when I am with a person and they are silent- I am not less interesed in the time spent with them. Far from it. Their talking and speech is not sole factor that makes them interesting. It's their presence and who they are as a person. Yes, I get that and agree that to get there, communication is needed to get to know a person, beyond that... 

So yeah, the societal pressure for introverts to meet more outgoing people in the middle in terms of communication appears to be something (now, I can only speak from my own experience) that extroverts are not willing to recriprocate on. It's almost as if...

""Talk = Interest in a person, Silence = What a bore""

The action sequences and the effects are all incredibly imaginative. Seriously, the artwork and uniqueness to the universe really piques in the prequels; just genius. 

I, for the life of me, will never warm up to the half-baked romance plot... That was something I will never get past... There are some bits of silly dialogue that are hard to get past too... But otherwise, there is a lot to love and enjoy about the Prequel universe.

Anxiety,fhu72xd,t3_f4vfzl,1581882762.0,"I'm really sorry to hear that... I personally have never been through such a situation, so I don't have the authenticity to give advice on that situation. If your parents refuse to bring you to a therapist, then maybe look up an online therapy resource. 

...I don't know if you are student- if so, get in touch with your school counselor. If it's hard to talk about, then I would recommend writing it down and giving the paper to the counselor. 

Just know that you have my understanding and well wishes."
