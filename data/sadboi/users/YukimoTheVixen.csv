So, it's been a year when I went in I just explain the situation of symptoms that makes it hard to go on with your life. I had severe anxiety, I couldn't sleep, bad dreams, not eating, nausea, even loosing memories/not retaining them. It's okay to be open REMEMBER it should be confidential so no one but them knows. Their job is to help you. 
Keep track of how often you use your meds or how often you skip and make a journal on how you feel. Becareful of the affects because when I was on it I ask if I can have a smaller than average dose because of my small size. So if something that really makes you upset about the med, tell them. 
I recently just got off my anti anxiety meds and honestly I still have anxious thoughts, but the symptoms don't hold me back to do things that I need to just live.
I hope this was helpful on your road of recovery.

Me and my other friends have this but what helps is to talk as if it was like any other day to calm those nerves and if you feel close enough talk to them about how you feel about testing anxiety and see what they think about it.

It will be tough... getting dreams of them and having cold sweat. Seeing them less and less everyday does help.
