Carbon to nitrogen ratios. go look that up. Logging, it deal with trees, logs, it is an industry like customer service or essential labor like meat packing. You need to know a landscape, the natural surroundings of what makes an area. sand silt and clay. understand that, and understand what states from New England, through the flyover plains, over the rockies, and onto the ""best coast"" have for soil fetility. Figure out why that matters, you know so you can ""gather stuff."" i am not saying you need a license to hunt and fish, but getting the information of a local municipality as to where to take classes is what would actually help. Know what a bear trap is and how not to cut you leg off. know where we have done chemical, atomic, and just left explosive things in the ground because america is great like that. Plan out what your interests are to what you would like to harvest out of your garden. dont try to steal from your neighbors as a lot of states even the old ladies wouldnt mind shooting an intruder. talk to them, have sone tea or coffee and get them to tell you how to hold a gun. maybe learn sone trapping, land water, air. Depending on what you choose, find a mammal for mutual benefit. You should give yourself 5 years, land fertility alone, before you even consider moving in to cut out grocery bills.

this is why you sound like a toolbag. because again, if your fussing with water freezing in a spray foam manicured cottage, realize 90% of the people you know, not friends, couldnt give a shit or begin to understand what you need help with when you wanna be a little red hen. Honestly, figure out what you really want out of this plan of yours, lurk moar, know how to use the wayback machine, and take some classes on trees, or marijuanaenthusiasts. Find information on water rights, understand snowpack and rainfall, and bring a box of tissues because theres a lot of land we have fucked up. How far do we need to go into materials and fabric? maybe just stating this should be enough, but probably isnt. balance the microplastics with natural fibers in a pro/con before you try to buy sheep or llamas. Go to a pig farm and tell them you want to learn how to raise pigs. dont electrocute yourself. Dont use sphagnum peat moss in your composting toilet. if you work yourself well enough there will be so much wood crap youll have buckets for years. but seriously, for your kind of people, when it comes to grilling, its all about the small spaces. wait until the smoke even starts to subside, and finish it out for flavor thats out of this world. seriously, that trip will be better than a bong filled with a gram of DMT, flavortown baby.

Microapartments are already a thing. We dont really need in person sales/transactions, just some safer/new manufacturing and production regulations. Maybe its a slightly unpopularopinion, but i cant make a case to change your mind, and am just shocked that with time this could very well be a possibly accepted future by a lot of people. The tragedy was probably referred to as death, but globally we are all equal, so it just becomes a part of our lives without being sugar coated. Fuck.

 I think you need to do a lot more research. You want to live in the wilderness but within less than an hour drive to ""your job."" Do you have money saved up? (i guess not really) I have known people who have moved into barren tundra to try and survive, and plenty of people with seasonal cabins. Food is an issue. In certain areas you need to plan deliveries, unless you figure out how a garden works and give yourself the years in advance of moving to bring the land up. Its kinda obvious you've never built a house let alone a prefab shed before. just because there are rivers and water doesnt mean people dont own wells. I'd suggest keeping your job, and working from a seasonal standpoint until you can figure out what you need. Then joining less internet based groups for learning about areas you think you can jump into within 5 years. Having a second, third, or fourth parcel of land in different areas and deciding which works better long term would save you from failing, but thats not practical. I dont think you'll find coastal property within your budget, I also dont think you have any idea how the weather affects what you can grow in a county like Aroostook, or even know that in a civilized world you need licenses.

It has a long recognised history in humanity. Maybe this has more to do with aspects of mania, but i think that is something that has been more prominent than an actual open diagnosis. Kind of like questions of sexuality in history.
 I know Halsey has spoken about it. There... my brain just went somewhere else. There are so many more people through history and currently, but it is still a very difficult diagnosis, and a lot of times it can get left to speculation. I guess the contemporary conversation around bipolar, or any area of mental health, is something i am grateful to see happen. I try not to concern myself about issues surrounding the stigma (as a reality it is there) and it is something that may still need to be kept private.

Surgical masks, scrubs, coverings and the like, are a fabric material that consists of three layers. the inside layer is a cellulose. The importance is the liquid barrier.

If you have a couple, spread them out in rotation with time(3-4 days?) I have a couple, none with vicks on them anymore. But now i gotta add, for people that find it easier to buy some kind of covering rather than make them, theres a lot of rave masks for sale online, some now at discount, others up to the market price (maybe a little cringe.)

ABoringDystopia,fma74iy,t1_fm8ygy5,1585885542.0,"I have to agree that, that video was a horrible way to present the argument. A big part of the reason why selfish altruism has difficulty grasping hold on anyone would be the way we are made to work. Doing anything for the benefit of others has a good chance of being detrimental to oneself, keeping us stuck in an action of self preservation. Another part is removing our actions, by degrees, from results, good or bad. This leaves our actions as amorphous concepts, for the majority of a lot of peoples time. In our personal life it may be easier to see the return of say helping your family out, rather than going to a bar or something to get away. The way we compartmentalize our information helps build a divide that makes the concept harder to take hold as an undercurrent of our daily life: associations.

There is then the argument of people being innately good. This is a concept that deals with idealism. Yes, i would believe the majority of people have good intentions deep down, even if it doesn't necessarily show, which is presentation. To cut to the chase ill bring up child-like innocence and what follows with nurture and nature. 9 out of ten kids prefer crayons to guns. But its that one kid, and when mixed with self preservation, probably dependent on confidence, things begin to erode. 
A person is separate from a group in the way they can function. People in groups love to compete. War is a part of life, that while we may want it removed, i dont think it would ever happen, its that part of society the video also left out.
Daily life itself would be the next part that would make this concept difficult to come into fruition. Enacting change in the mindset of a group gets more complicated with relation to the size of the group. As we can see with certain groups believing in whats better, even with yourself trying to ""turn on"" more people, it becomes a ""thing."" The biggest example of why social altruism doesnt work, in probably a lot of peoples minds, would be religion. Everything is based off doing outward good for a ""karmic"" return. Removing the religion and keeping to sociology, let alone business, would be restarting the spread, through a group. There might be line to cross, where the majority keeps the minority in check, but i think there is also a line of no return when dealing with group size. There are many reasons people who believe in a Utupia are dreaming, but most have accepted this problem when dealing with size. It also talks about a zero sum game which i also cant agree that we are living with, as people. So i guess its better to individually be aware of how our actions affect the larger group we reside in, but the idea itself has limits smaller than what seems most peoples goals are.

edit: the net positive is also not true, but helps recognize the video as propaganda. People say positivity is stronger than negativity, but i think there are limits with group size."

It would be so rare to find even a brunch place that could offer this, with actual substance like waffles or eggs benedict, or something people eat. So you get juice product or hopefully ""not burnt"" drip. Maybe the drip coffee is bottomless, but if its burnt it's a far representation of what you really want, but its more than water.

They dont even get water, maybe eggs or toast, or just end up picking off peoples plates.

Coronavirus,flrtbkc,t1_flrdlpz,1585427414.0,"Now where is the line of information management and process of dissemination. There is a big portion of cases being asymptomatic and able to spread the disease. The only thing that makes me think of is latency, or dormancy, as with cases like HIV and herpes. There has not been enough time for even china to have definitive answers, but we should be aware of possibilities even if studies show to be negative. This began to be researched at the [end of January](http://m.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7297) , but as it would be such a dramatic death knell i can see how it wouldn't be publicised. 

Now [NPR,](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/27/822407626/mystery-in-wuhan-recovered-coronavirus-patients-test-negative-then-positive) as most likely any place, is reporting this anomaly to testing error. Covid-19 may not be the virus that kills you because it is an immune response. But how does your body get rid of it? if we aren't testing recovery and only go off of symptoms, what is to say you recover from one flare up, but covid-19 becomes dormant. Then you get infected with another illness and covid-19 builds itself back. We are not ready to handle the possibilities of this occurrence. But without much information regarding asymptomatic spread we are just removing ourselves from known possibilities of RNA viruses."

ABoringDystopia,flfw0in,t1_fldmz16,1585119987.0,"Why is the labor of a company treated like a cost to run said company, rather than as an equal part of the revenue? The labor keeps the value of the public shares. The stock value in a company could be put back for use above and beyond what the labor is able to handle; like expansions or renovations. The stock value is money making money, and part of that money came from the labor. Buying shares, giving money for the company to use, can give a return. How is the return given back to the labor? The labor is equal to the building, rent, stuff, as a cost. profit margins go to ownership, shareholders.

The companies value goes up. renovations are what gets put back into labor. bonuses are what goes to ownership. Really if things are just running the same, but shareholder value increased, why bother renovating and expanding? no renovations, but bonuses can go up, for ownership. Shareholders increase value. Nothing needs to be put back into the company cost. Lets implement a lot of turnover, since we have people getting raises every year, errr since the costs of running the company are increasing. Trim half the workforce down for basically the same productivity. renovate later. Shareholders increase their value.

edit: i was gonna add, if the labor, as people, were equal to shareholders, and not a cost to the company it would not seem as bad for a company to get bailed out. Technically, in a way, they would be taking from the labor twice, not returning profits directly, and tax payers."
