It happened to me when I was 15 and it was the first time I ever drank, I had a boyfriend back then that wasn't drunk (I think he just had one or two glasses several hours before)
I was drunk enough to not walk or think straight, even to throw up, but I wasn't drunk enough to not be awake. Something happened (I think it was my fault) and he was upset and sad so he went to the guest room of my friends house (it was a small ""party"" we were only 6) and I went to check him up, we talked a bit and I dont remember whose idea was to go to the restroom, I think it was mine, so my drunk mind thought it was a good idea to make him think that I wanted to make him feel good (sorry if this doesn't make sense) my plan wasn't really to do anything so I had the excuse that he didnt had a condom but he got out one (we only had very few sexual encounters and they were never that big, I didnt expect him to have one) I gave him oral sex that didnt last long and I walked away, he wasn't aggressive or forced me into anything, I wouldn't have done it if I wasn't drunk but I'm aware that I put myself in that situation, I'm just mad at myself and sad that he didnt took care of me (I know that I'm the one that should've done that but it was the first time I drank so I didn't expected me to be that way)
I'm so sorry if this is dumb"
