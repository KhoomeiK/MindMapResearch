Okay. 

As for your second paragraph, it's nothing but an attempt to change the subject completely. 

Just by the way, if Americans had free healthcare and paid sick leave they'd be doing a lot better right about now, wouldn't they? Funny how socialism is fine for Wall Street when it wants to be bailed out. Just not for regular people. Go figure."
