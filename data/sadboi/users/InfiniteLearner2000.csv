In the meantime any suggestions on how to find local tattoo artists in my area on Instagram?

I pretty much have decided the semi-colon into birds and thinking an old nautical steering wheel in between the two to symbolize control and that I steer my own ship. ***Would love other suggestions though of symbols people have tattoos of to symbolize ""control of oneself and life"".***  


As far as general concerns about professionalism and tattoos, what have been your guys' experience who have visible tattoos that work in a professional environment that typically tattoos would be not 'accepted'? Or more even so for getting hired.

Divorce_Men,flnqf93,t1_flmku31,1585323890.0,"ye thats kinda my response when people say that other peeps have it way worse etc. - that it doesn't make my situation suck any less. But I do try to be grateful for the things I do have, which does help.

Been seeing my therapist at my usual rate of 1/week which honestly is not enough given the current situation. I am not sure that my insurance will pay for more than 1x/week (although I think they do) but honestly affording the co-pays atm are difficult so I am stuck with 1x/week.

I do have a great friend who I have been meeting up with most nights to just have cigarettes and talk shit over and also just hang out. We make sure to keep at least 6 + feet distance as we're both pretty nervous cuz of the pandemic.   


I guess, a lot of my friends are not reaching out as often as I would have liked, but at the same time realize everyone has their own lives. I guess I feel cuz I would be reaching out more often if they were in my shoes I have that expectation. But thats not fair? Some friends, and it may just be my perception, I feel that I am a burden to them cuz I talk about all my problems and everyone's lives suck at the moment so they don't wanna hear more.  


Anyways, thanks."

Actually am going to be crashing by my buddy and his wife who are gracious enough to let me stay by them. I am extremely allergic to their dog and worried about it, but its better than living here and not only not being able to move forward and prepare for the next chapter of my life but actually regress and fight just to survive and make it through the day.  


But thanks, I am strong and I will get through this. As will you. Sounds like you've been doing a lot of healthy stuff. I have just been walking as much as I can. Unfortunately got a bad ankle so can't run atm but gonna start adding more and more to my workouts."

Def need to remind myself this is temporary. 

That's the best way I have ever heard it put - ""Be ready to tackle the world once you get out of this"". That is exactly what I am trying to do. I have been doing telemed sessions w/ my therapists. Have one coming up later today. That is exactly how I am going to phrase what I want to work on in the session and things I can do to get to the point that ""I am ready to tackle the world once I am out of this"".

Unfortunately can't run due to bad ankle but I did take an hr long walk last night and it felt great. Going to start slowly adding more exercise that is possible and safe to do during this pandemic.

I guess that does sound odd when I actually say that cuz that is the definition of transcribing but I am looking to just get better at playing songs by ear for the aforementioned benefits. I was planning on listening and just learning the songs to commit to memory. 

Is there a lot more benefit gained by actually writing it down in either notation? I can see the huge benefit in transcribing to musical notation as that would help with Sight Reading but don't see much benefit in writing tab vs just memorizing the songs. 

I can read the notes on a ledger and at one point could play a bit of piano and very basic bass tunes but it would take me a good amount of effort and time (the main barrier being time) to get back to sight-reading shape. It would also take me a lot longer to transcribe the songs in musical notation that if I don't plan on learning to sight-read fluently not sure I see the benefit outweighing the cost in time.

Of course I can get upset at your interpretation because I not only didn’t say I was intending to do any of things you assumed I would but I never even hinted to it. Again, really sad that you decided to delete your caring supportive apology, because it was appropriate. I didn’t do anything to deserve your nasty assumptions. Like I said before, if you wanna help, ask for clarity before just giving your “interpretation” which is meaningless as it’s not founded in anything and just plain and simple mean.

My original reply to your apology....



Thank you for the apology. I realized after I responded that you probably had a traumatizing experience that led to your reaction. I in no way shape or form am planning to do any of those things so I appreciate the apology.

Thank you for the advice as well. I’m worried that things will get ugly when I really don’t want them to. I value our time together and the relationship we had. She was and always will be a big part of my life; even afterwards I will have been with her for almost a 3rd of my life so there’s no way she won’t be. But unfortunately ultimately I know this is not a healthy marriage. Even if we work on it at the end of the day we are not well suited for each other. I’m really really hoping things won’t get ugly.  We don’t have too much to split but enough that it could become a problem. I want to do amicably and collaboratively. 

Thank you for the advice and I appreciate the words of caution because of course it’s a big emotional ordeal and no matter what one says things can always get ugly. Again, really hoping it doesn’t. Thanks."
Divorce,fezr9uq,t1_fezl7ka,1579460645.0,"I have no idea what you're talking about or where you gathered all these assumptions.

Obviously I am not going to ghost my wife wtf? Nor is she going to be blind sighted. For one we have huge regular fights all the time where each of us has thrown in the divorce card when we’re heated. She also knows how I feel that I am unhappy and knows that we are having serious problems and even with that I made tons of calls to marriage counselors and all she has to do is call and make an intake apt. 

We had a therapist a year ago but we didn’t like him. I can’t work on things if my wife isn’t willing to go to counseling with me. I have made it literally as easy as possible for her but with the way it works she needs to do an intake by herself first. I gave her the info a month ago to call and again I was the one making all the calls and getting the info and seeing where we could afford to go.

My therapist never said to do any of those things, “cut her off; stop talking to her, try to take all the assets”??!? Where the fuck do you come off assuming I’m going to be doing any of those things and calling/implying me/I'm a narcissist? You have no idea what my plan was. It was to do collaborative divorce. And I have no intention of taking all the assets nor do we even have many assets to begin with. 

Of course I am going to talk about my marriage with my therapists. Because that’s a big part of my life. He never told me to do a single thing. I’m just having a hard time telling my wife I want a divorce because I do love her but we aren’t a good fit together. I want to be having the conversation with my wife. I am just having a hard time initiating the conversation and that's what my therapist has been helping me do.

Jesus fucking Christ. Where the fuck do you come off?

Some redditors/people never cease to amaze me. It’s in an interesting time we live in. I was just looking for advice on how to approach the topic with my wife and I figured r/divorce would be that place - apparently not. It seems so far it's mainly been a bunch of people who make wild assumptions and being completely off base assholes. With the exception of the two people who were supportive. Why not ask questions before assuming things if you actually care to respond and advise or help? I’m certainly talking to the wrong people about divorce, you’re right on that.

Divorce,ferpvun,t1_fepvedm,1579356991.0,"Not sure why therapist is in quotations but we have gone to marriage counseling together where nothing came of it. My therapist is aware that I am only sharing my side of the story and is still appalled by some of the things that have taken place. Regardless of what my therapist feels because he is not in my marriage, it is ultimately up to me and what matters most is my perspective on how I am being treated and not supported. There are things in my marriage that make it obvious to me that even if we went back to more counseling nothing would come of it. She has literally said to me ""she can't change and I need to learn to work around her"". There are so many red flags. We are not a team nor unit but essentially glorified roommates where I am being thrown around and walked all over. 

Yes, of course, she will have a different perspective and feel that this is not happening, which honestly is part of the problem. If she were able to see it from my perspective then maybe we wouldn't have so many problems. Either way, if one partner is extremely unhappy in the marriage and feels taken advantage of, then imo, its that partner's right to leave the marriage. You don't need a reason to leave a marriage other than being unhappy. Yes, that would be extremely selfish if that were the only reason, but for me, it's not. I am not being supported in any way shape or form and my mental health is suffering. As the commentator below put it, I am being treated as her punching bag. I know from her perspective she doesn't feel its this way but again, that's part of the problem.

It is my mistake for posting and expecting everyone to be supportive and understand as Reddit is literally just a forum with complete strangers over the internet from all around the world. **But I posted because I know that I should ask for a divorce but am having trouble doing so because I do care about my partner and it will be an extremely difficult thing to do.** **I was looking more for advice on how to get past this block.** Not for someone to tell me my ""therapist"" should hear it from her POV when he understands he is only getting the negatives, but the point is that the negatives are so appalling that her perspective wouldn't change much. And again, I do hear her perspective, believe me, I do cuz she yells it at me and I know this is what I need to do for myself out of self-respect and for the sake of the rest of my life.   


TLDR: Not sure why you said ""therapist"", he has a doctorate in psychology and is my therapist. Regardless of credentials I find him very helpful in all areas of my life and he is experienced and not an idiot and understands he is only hearing the worst of it and me venting but with that, he still thinks it's unhealthy for me to be in this marriage. Regardless of his thoughts, I am the one in the marriage and **know I need to do this for myself but I am having trouble doing so because its a difficult thing to do**. To tell someone you want a divorce after you've been married for a bit and together for much longer. Also, everything that comes with it afterward and not sure how to navigate that. **This is not a healthy marriage, we have worked on it to no avail, I need to get out and need some advice on how to not second guess myself, go through with it, deliver the news, and navigate things afterward.**"
ect,felspg4,t3_epml08,1579229985.0,"From what I have read and heard from psychiatrists unilateral is just as effective but as you noted with fewer side effects. There is no reason to believe that bilateral will be more effective, at least from what I have read in literature. I would discuss this with your psychiatrist though. 

There are other variables that can be changed in terms of the delivery of electricity - like pulse length, pulse train, and energy applied.  As far as I understand the idea is to produce a seizure in the prefrontal cortex where it then propagates to other areas of the brain unintentionally like the hippocampus which produces the side effects in memory. So changing those parameters won't do much in terms of efficacy as the idea is really just to initiate a seizure and ideally using the lowest amount of energy required to do so as raising it will only increase side effects. Unilateral ECT generally does not have as many side effects because the seizures do not propagate as far and are more controlled.

TLDR: As far as I know Unilateral is just as effective as Bilateral. I would talk to your psychiatrist though about your specific concerns though."

The difference is my psychosis accompanies an extreme mood state and does not occur without a change in extreme mood state.  i.e. when I am not manic. As well as the aforementioned distinctions in the type of psychotic symptoms, although my episodes require hospitalizations. Not really sure how psychosis doesn't require hospitalization.

Didn’t go through all the comments but I’d like to add Tal Wilkenfeld. She’s utterly amazing. She started off her career at an extremely early age and toured with some outstanding world wide acclaimed musicians including Jeff Beck and Herbie Hancock. She released an album that was mainly in the style of jazz which showed off her prowess, technical skills, and Jazz music ear also at a really young age. 

But what’s more interesting to me is how she’s evolved into a beautiful songwriter and musician who writes emotional works of art. Far too often with virtuosos, especially those who get a start at an early age, I feel they never really develop into good songwriters and full musicians and often miss the emotional aspects of music and release music that just contains them showing off their technical skills. I saw her at mercury lounge last year and was blown away. The song I am gonna link is [Under The Sun](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m3VqpX3GVdo) which is off of her most recent album.

1. a **disorder** of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one **that produces specific signs or symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury.**
2. ***a particular quality, habit, or disposition regarded as adversely affecting a person or group of people.***

**Origin**

**old french** \- des, aise -> desaise - **lack of ease** \-> **middle English** disease - **lack of ease; inconvenient**

It is. Anything that puts a person in dis-ease or not at ease or discomfort, is a disease. I used to think that it wasn't as well but you are thinking of all the connotations that a disease implies to the layperson; transmittible, something you've ""caught"", contagious etc. - but anything that puts any person or patient in discomfort is a disease by its proper definition.

An ingrown toenail could be considered a disease.

I completely understand your point and distinction though. Although it is just semantics, it is very important how we talk about our illnesses/disorders/disease wtvr you want to call it, to ourselves and others. Especially since there is so much stigma around mental health illness. You are right in that I probably shouldn't call it a disease because most people don't know the real, precise, and simple definition of disease and understand it in the way society and culture have come to understand the word.

Just like I think its really important to say we have bipolar disorder, not that we are bipolar. It is a part of us, a medical condition just like any other medical condition, just like someone has cancer and is not cancer. We are not bipolar and not the disorder but it is a part of us and goes along with the rest of us. Like being creative, intelligent, funny, strong-willed, or wtvr other characteristics we each posses respectively.  


Edit: Added the bold parts to the first definition because I actually realized that in the definition of disease itself, it is defined as a disorder that produces specific signs and symptoms. So a disease is really also just a disorder. Technically, they are the same things. 

Either way, let us all keep fighting the good fight and do the best with what we got while helping and supporting each other.  I plan to spend my career on hopefully furthering our understanding of mental illnesses but also change the actual landscape of mental health treatment.

I didn't see this before I replied further up but this is essentially my point as well. We're still the exact same people but we have an ailment so we have to take medication for it. But we still have all the same characteristics we did before and still value the same things. We just have to work a little bit harder to fight the symptoms of our ailments. 

But honestly, as much as this fucking disease sucks, and we all know it sucks very very much and it is ineffable unless you have it but at least we have the meds and tech that is out there now for us to take. Yes, I am the first to complain about the side effects but fuck man like 30-40 years ago I probably would've been institutionalized and could not be living the life I am today.

BipolarReddit,fdm6usm,t1_fdlttnv,1578541242.0,"I actually went to a mood disorder support group and literally asked this same question verbatim. But I got a wonderful answer that really helped me. 

There is no separation. It is a part of us, just like any other characteristic - creative, intelligent, etc. We have bipolar disorder just like anyone else has any other medical ailment. I was stuck in the same mindset of, how do I know what's me and what's the disorder? And then that was given to me as an answer and I really liked how it sat with me but then I was like well, what about medication? Like, what if I am someone completely different on different meds? Or I am striving to be the ""real me"" and I want that perfect cocktail that will keep my symptoms in check and I will be the idealized version of myself? And I received yet another great answer, ""Is the medicine doing its job? Is it keeping me out of the hospital 3x a year? Yes, well then it doesn't really matter does it?""  


I get so hung up on this and end up questioning myself, actions, and thoughts. But if I just accept that BP is a part of me and my medication is doing its job of keeping me stable, then the rest doesn't matter. I should just be myself and I will only continue to become more of myself through everything I do. I can still ask myself and be self-reflective just like any human being can be, is action x,y, or z something I think was a good decision? Was it helpful to me and did it not hurt others? Is it something I value?   


For me, I am always so considered with all of this and I know for myself at least that if I worry about it less and try not to expend energy on it, then the question will answer itself and I will be able to be present and enjoy my life as much as I can."

It is interesting though cuz it seems Lithium is the only single drug that has a group of ""good responders"" that ""if lithium works, it fucking works"". I don't see people saying that about Depakote Or Seroquel or any other single psychotropic med. Usually, I will hear people saying its a combination of X, Y, and Z and they still have A, B, and C side effects.

So I think you're right, I should maybe give it a try and see if I am one of those ""good responders"" cuz it would be pretty damn awesome to be in that category. I just hope I don't have the ""FOG"" or dulled down side effects."
BipolarReddit,fbzhgxr,t1_fbzghwe,1577246835.0,"Thank you for your detailed reply. 

What are the common and dangerous long term side effects you are referring to? Do you mean that you are mostly able to avoid these side effects through hydration and monitoring? 

Sorry if I was unclear, I am not a musician by trade (although at times I wish I was). I was in music school for a bit but have since switched to a career in scientific research actually hoping to focus on mental health through the lens of biomedical engineering. 

Because of these two areas of my life, music and scientific research, I am constantly concerned about the motor and memory/cognitive side effects of my medications. I experience muscle spams from time to time and feel that my memory and cognitive abilities are not where they used to be. But that could be due to normal aging and also the fact that I have had over 20+ ECT treatments and not the medications I am on. I looked up the side effect profiles for Lithium and they seem to be the same as my current meds more or less (seroquel and depakote).

So I guess the question becomes will those side effects be the same as they are now but alleviate some of the emotional volatility and reactivity I am currently experiencing."

Yeah, I have been on all of those as well and as I mentioned in a response to an earlier comment I was on a lot of other meds that I don't even know I was on as I was psychotic at the time. 

I think what is probably important to remember is that each case of BPD is different and everyone reacts differently to each med. I wanted to get a general feel though and it seems like Lithium can help with the issues I am having. So perhaps I should talk to my doc and give it a try."
bipolar,fbzavgw,t1_fbz8oi8,1577240596.0,"Thank you for your response.

That is what I am trying to avoid - making bad decisions. Really more in the realm of interpersonal relationships and overreacting (sometimes affects professional life). 

I know there are skills I can work on to help with this. I am in a DBT skills group but I still can't seem to help myself so I am at the point where I think it may be a medication issue. But I am not sure if its par for the course with BP and I will just need to keep working on it or if it's worth trying different medications. I have been on more than I know as during 5 hospitalizations they gave me meds when I was psychotic and I did not know I was on but know I had terrible reactions to, like akathisia and rapid cycling and worsening psychosis."
BipolarReddit,fbzacnu,t1_fbz8w9c,1577240110.0,"Thank you for your response.  


hmmm,....yeah I actually forgot that is one of the main reasons I was afraid of trying Lithium; for the risk of feeling too subdued and flat. I remember in a BP support group one of the members mentioned that he felt that way. I am generally a sensitive and empathetic individual and I don't want to lose that part of myself.  I am a musician and feel that I still want to be in touch with my emotions. This illness is so tricky - I am constantly asking myself is this me or my disorder? I am not sure if it's better to be too emotionally reactive or too subdued? 

I know what it's like to be on seroquel + depakote and to feel like this, maybe I can give lithium a try. Thing is not sure if it is worth it to try switching and risk an episode/hospitalization. I got too much going well in my life that I don't want to risk it. I mean there is never a good time to have an episode but this would probably be one of the worst."

It is still interesting to me that the ETS is dictating to schools how they should admit their students and not the other way around (even though this is probably more of a ""we have to say this"" kind of thing than the school not already knowing this). Regardless of this, I think the GREs existence is unfortunate as although schools do look holistically at applications, some schools still use it as a first-line measure to throw out applicants. I think we both know that the difference between 156 and 164 can easily make or break that cut off before evening being able to have the rest of one's application looked at. 

Not to mention, the GRE is extremely expensive and study materials can be costly. It just all seems unnecessary to me and a bit unfair as some will have more access to more materials based on their financial means. Then again that argument/logic could really be used for any test - even tests in undergraduate courses that a part of determining your GPA or the SAT and getting into college. 

Ah, what evs. I am just frustrated really. Cuz I think it would be unfortunate if my application got thrown out simply because of a GRE cutoff as I know my school of interest still uses the GRE only because US News uses it for school rankings. So if it prohibits me from furthering my education and pursuing my passion for helping people through scientific study, it would just blow. Cuz I don't think the GRE really is telling of my ability or adeptness to do that or not."

And that’s even a crazier spread. An 8 point spread 156-164 is huge in terms of percentiles. So despite it having 95% in those measures, that’s still terrible (imo).

But anyways, even if it is standardized in the ways you cited, I am pretty sure it is not a good indicator of one’s success in grad school. Hence why a lot of top programs are getting rid of it as an application requirement. For example, for top engineering programs, Stanford, Harvard, and Berkeley have all nixed it as a requirement."

I am still a little bit confused though. So I have bipolar disorder 1 w/ psychosis as I have full-blown mania and depression and the psychosis is associated with a mood disorder, namely mania where I will slip into psychosis?   


So to clarify the difference is, schizophrenia is a thought disorder that features psychosis but does not necessarily have a mood component as well? But then what is the difference between Bipolar disorder I w/ psychosis and schizoaffective disorder?  


Thankfully, both are fairly treatable (I use the word fairly as we are all well aware of the side effects of our medications and honestly that our medicine does not 100% prevent episodes even with us taking the best care of ourselves that we can) where we can be stabilized and either not have episodes of either extreme moods (w/ or w/o psychosis) for BP? and not have symptoms of thought disorder and psychosis for schizophrenia?  


I am asking this last part like I don't know the answer even though I do. I have had bipolar disorder I for over 11 yrs and have had 5 hospitalizations but am lucky enough to be relatively stable when I am not experiencing a manic psychotic episode. With the exception of a few depressive and hypomanic episodes that again, I am lucky enough to be able to see a wonderful doctor where we catch it early before it turns into full-blown mania and do a med change as necessary."

I did a very peripheral search and there does not seem to be a process called ""methylation bipolar disorder"" that causes memory loss per se. In the context of bipolar disorder, there has been some evidence that methylation occurs but they are not sure of the reason [BP - Accelerated Aging](https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/bipolar-disorder-linked-accelerated-epigenetic-aging/). In this article, that is not a peer-reviewed publication but references peer-reviewed publications that found that accelerated aging occurs in people with BP. But again, it is not necessarily due to the disorder itself. They admit that they did not control for drug usage, smoking, and other factors that may confound their results.  They did see that younger people with BP had lower markers for accelerated aging which they believe may be due to the fact that they have not incurred as much stress as older people with BP. This study, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003658/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003658/) even suggests that it could be used as a biomarker and possible treatment but they cannot definitively say because again they are not certain as to the cause of the methylation.  


As far as having more episodes leading to further ones, yes this is true. Neuronal pathways are strengthened every time neurons, and groups of neurons fire. That's why it is extremely important to take medication that prevents manic episodes. 

In regards to smaller hippocampi volumes, I found some studies that actually suggested people with BP have [Larger hippocampi volumes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20160210) but they do decrease with time as also mentioned in this study  [Lithium Protection for Hippocampi Volume Decrease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3525647/) but again medication has neuroprotective effects on this decrease. Regardless, the pathology for hippocampal volumes decreasing is unknown and not due to ""Methylation Bipolar Disorder"".  It does not seem to be related to the pathology of BP disorder itself but environmental factors, like stress which obviously people with BP disorder have more exposure to, which may cause the epigenetic methylation effect, but it is not necessarily the disorder itself by any means.  


But again, I did not do an extensive literature review on the subject, which is why I was hoping you would have posted the articles you found but it seems there is no evidence that supports people with BP are prone to memory loss and cognitive decline due to the pathology of the disorder itself. At least not in regards to methylation."
BipolarReddit,f7qmv7j,t1_f7owo4u,1573966292.0,"Hi. I saw you mention this on a similar post/thread. I asked this there also, but do you have any publications or research of any kind that supports this? Where did you get this information from?"
BipolarReddit,f7p309l,t3_dx5mls,1573940839.0,"Thank you for posting this. This is a constant real struggle and issue that both my Psychiatrist and Therapist don't give it the full attention it deserves. I am sad that it's a universal bipolar issue but pleased in a sense because it seems some medications have more of a negative cognitive effect than others and perhaps there is hope for me with the use of apps and a med change.

My doctor and therapist hear my complaints but say that I present well to them and better than a vast majority of their other patients so it's not an issue worth discussing or addressing. This frustrates me to no end, and in a way, I feel I am being gaslighted, because I know that comparatively where I used to be cognition wise to where I am now is way below my potential or peak performance. Granted I have had 25+ ECT treatments and I am sure this plays a role, but I did not feel this way after the first 4 rounds and I don't think it hurts to explore a med change. I actually already have Elevate and have been using it but I am going to talk more seriously with my doctor about a med change.  He is responsive normally, but he doesn't think there is much that can be done and I have to work with what I got now but is an academic so I think coming to him with articles would help him to look into it more and take my issue more seriously.   


The issue is, just like other members mentioned, its a balance of being stable and controlling the med side effects. I have too much going on in my life in a good way to have an episode. Yes, there is never a good time for an episode, but right now would probably be the worst time.   


I plan to look at the articles linked, particularly the anticonvulsant study posted by r/sa350g as I am on 2000 mg Depakote (anticonvulsant) plus 400 mg Seroquel (not too mention the 0.5 mg of Klonapin of sleep - which is undoubtedly bad for memory).   


I just can't fucking take it anymore though - math problems and logical reasoning/concepts used to be so easy for me and now it takes me 5x longer only to still not fully understand it. I am in grad school so I need to be at peak performance and as I said I am going to talk to my pdoc more and would like to come to him with some studies/publications. So if anyone has any articles related to bipolar medications and cognition, please send them my way!  


I can't stand the fact that one day, I can barely have a conversation cuz I can't keep my train of thought and at best some days I am performing at 1/50th of my potential. I gotta get this figured out, I don't feel like me.

The fact that it ""jolted you back into reality and stopped you from wanting to kill yourself"" in my opinion is not only wonderful but makes the treatment worth it right there. Yes, there are side effects to the treatment but virtually all medical treatments have side effects. The ol' is the juice worth the squeeze question applies (odd way of putting costs vs benefits but you get the point). Imo, 100x yes - without having had had the ECT treatments I might even still be psychotic and not be able to function enough to be outside of a psych ward let alone be a productive member of society and actually enjoy my life when I am feeling better, sane, functional, and not having episodes.   


My advice is to really not get too bogged down on what are the side effects and how the treatments have affected you. Really great advice from my therapist and doctor was, focus on what I (or you) can do, not what I can't. So instead of wondering has my memory become worse I just do my best with what I got and where I am at.   


Everyone has their battles. This one seems to be ours. So let us play the hands we're dealt, receive the best care we can, which for me (and you as well it seems) included receiving some ECT treatments, take care of ourselves the best we can, and live our lives - and dare I say it? Even enjoy them?!? When we are asymptomatic and thankfully stable?!? I say we do.  


Cheers brother. Hoping you get well soon."
ect,ezv3knh,t3_d2c2xa,1568166292.0,"Hey. Yeah I have had ECT treatments to treat drug resistant psychotic episodes for four out of five of my episodes. I was on the other end of the spectrum though where I was extremely manic (like could not be outside of a locked behavioral health unit manic) and experiencing paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and the whole works.

The first time, they did have to involve and bring in the state dept of mental health as I didn’t have a medical proxy and was not well enough to have agency for myself. I received 15 treatments or so. Then I believe the later episodes I received an average course of 8 or so treatments per episodes totaling some where over 30 total ECT treatments.

Unfortunately I had Bilateral ECT which has more known side effects, negative effects to  memory and cognition, and has not been proven to be more effective. 

Honestly, up until this last round that was about 15 months ago at this point, I felt that I recovered in the short memory and cognition domains. I am not sure why, but I only had 6 ECT treatments this last time but it feels that I still have not recovered from them. All the other episodes and course of ECT treatments I felt that I was able to bounce back from. This time, it’s been well over 6 months (as I mentioned 15+ months mark) where I normally felt almost fully recovered with the exception of not remembering stuff that directly happened around the time of the episodes and ECT treatments.

I have a new doctor where I feel I am in much better care now with him. He isn’t really sure why this time is any different from the previous episodes (was not under his care) and doesn’t feel it’s the cumulative effects of all of them. I honestly think it could be one of my sleep medications that I was only on for a short period of time following each episode but have been on this whole time now. So I’m trying to ween off of that.

TLDR: yes, had for psychotic manic episodes where I normally felt recovered from each course of ECTs except for this last one - not sure why."
bipolar,exkrbmk,t1_exjvegz,1566397126.0,"Just wanted to clear up a few things, then I will respond to your last post.  


I was not trying to ""one-up you"" on the severity of my illness or suggest I may be worse off because I have ""elected to have ECT""; the point was everyone has their own unique ""flavor"" (for lack of a better word) of the disorder. Sure we could compare, but it's pointless. I am sure I have it harder than some but I am also sure I have it easier than a lot of people as well.   


I also didn't simply ""elect to have ECT"" - it was not like they are walking around (as I am guessing from the sound of it, you've been hospitalized as well) going, ""Hey who wants some ECTs with their breakfast?"". It was actually a very long process that I was completely unaware and not involved with as I was not in the capacity to be involved. The state had to come and okay the procedure because I didn't have the agency to advocate for myself. I was in the hospital for two months where my psychotic symptoms were only getting worse and I was not responding to any medications, so the doctors had to make a case that ECT was necessary. Thankfully, and I am so grateful for it because I instantly responded well to it and started to do better. I then had to receive another 15 or so treatments for that initial episode and hospitalization. I have since then had another 4 episodes where ECTs were employed in 3 of them.   


Anyways, I didn't want to get into that too much but I completely understand your point now and agree with you. From your initial post that was not what I took away from it (as explained in my response). It does suck how much the media and the entertainment industry is now romanticizing Bipolar Disorder as it paints a nice pretty picture that we are in control of the symptoms and they are a direct response to our actions and that every single person who suffers from it has some sort of special gift (whether it be creative or intellectual or wtvr) when that is obviously not the case. It is much more complex than that and in actuality, we are pretty much at the whim of the disorder.   


Again, agree that this portrayal is unfair and doesn't do us any favors. Its ""funny"" (not funny but you know what I mean), because in the same breath the media when discussing something tragic that happens (talking about mass shootings or things of that nature - extremely unfortunate), they will say the person had ""mental illness"" or was ""bipolar"" or in treatment etc. and it demonizes us. It seems like we are in the midst of a change in the tides of how mental illness is portrayed in media and entertainment. Both are unfair, stigmatizing, and not helpful.   


To answer your question regarding ECT. For me, it was absolutely necessary and has brought me back to life during my episodes. But, if you can get away with not having to have it, then I would avoid it. Especially if you have had a negative experience with anesthesia. I have had it so many times that I now associate anesthesia with ECT and waking up with the biggest headache of my life as if I just had multiple seizures, because I did. 

Usually, my memory problems in the past have not been that bad and I have recovered from noticing any difference about 6 - 8 months after my last treatment but this last episode, which was over 14 months away from the last treatment, I feel that I have not fully recovered from it. I am not sure if is from the cumulative effects of having over 25 - 30 treatments in my lifetime or the way they did it this last past time? Although, it was the same doctors and the same hospital, so not sure what would have been different.    


So in the end, I wouldn't really recommend it unless completely and absolutely necessary. I have only had them for manic episodes which are not their typical use. They are mostly used clinically for depression. I would talk further with your doctor about your concerns so that you can have a better idea for a risk/benefit assessment. It definitely did wonders and has made it possible for me to return to my normal life but I don't feel I am as mentally agile as I used to be prior to my first episode, but that could be due to normal aging and the trauma and pathology of the episodes each time anyways. If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask. Other than that I don't know what else to add - that is my general experience."
bipolar,exj000l,t1_exczpye,1566339077.0,"You are right in that we all have different ""severities of the illness"" and manifestations of the disorder. However, I don't think that makes anyone else's experience less painful to them or their having bipolar disorder any less tragic. \[ Everyone's life experiences are relative and their absolute truths, but beyond that, there are always people who have it ""worse"" or have it ""better"", than we do - we gotta focus on what cards we were dealt and play the hand the best way we can. \]  


My main concern though is not the above. My concern lies within the question of what is the point in playing the ""I have it worse game""? ........For sympathy? To find solace in self-pity? That does not promote healthy behavior. I can explain to you and go into detail about my 5 hospitalizations, > 25 + ECTs, paranoid delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, etc. but what's the point?   


That kind of thinking is dividing more than anything else. The point of the Tumblr post was to bring people who suffer from the same disorder together. To find some comfort in the fact that we are not alone in this harrowing disruptive often misunderstood chronic illness. We are all in this together.   


I would encourage you to try and stay away from the segregating ""comparative severity"" mentality in order to be able to use this online community as a resource for support. I don't mean to call you out or anything, but I am really trying to get the point across to you that we shouldn't be comparing ourselves to each other in a competitive manner as that helps no one, but rather discuss our experiences that do overlap and support one another and offer strategies that have worked for us and at the very least be there for each other.   


I think we have enough going against us as is, why pin ourselves against each other? The stigma already exists out there with healthy and ""normal"" individuals - let's not create a further divide.   


If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know."

But is this the case even if the damage is due to negligence and mishandling on their part? We have video footage of them being reckless with it. The $0.60/lb is for accidental damage - I guess that might be one and the same legally? Seems unfair if that is the case but what can you do - like you said, and with most things, usually learn the hard way with these things but I do want to know if it's possibly worthwhile to take to small claims court because we do have the footage."
