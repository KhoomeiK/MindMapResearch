MMJ,fr3p898,t3_gmcul9,1589862624.0,"I'm actually going to go to school for marijuana sciences with a specific interest in CBN. I cure my cannabis. Not just cure, but i leave it in direct sunlight sometimes as well to help that THC degrade into CBN. I have panic disorder, depression, PTSD, and ADHD. Using 1 year cured has been there best but the most noticable effect for shortest period is 6 months. CBN helps me not make stupid decisions and helping sativa strains that are great for ADHD symptoms not give me panic attacks. Sorry if this is garbled mess it's late and I'm medicated. Hope this is kinda what you were hoping for"
