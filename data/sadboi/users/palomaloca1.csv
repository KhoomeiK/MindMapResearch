I have depression and anxiety, diagnosed, from my time in the military and I’m making myself parent because I literally have nobody else.  my kids dads gave up parenting to be selfish while I’m suffering. I have zero family or friends nearby. I’ve been through 2 abusive relationships. I’ve had to do all of it ALONe even though I need to “zone out”. 

OP, It’s not fair that you’re pulling all the weight. Counseling doesn’t do shit for someone unless they realize the have a problem. My advice? Pretend he’s not there. Don’t do shit for him unless he wants to contribute. Cook for you and the kids. Do yours and the kids laundry. Don’t talk to him. Don’t acknowledge him. Don’t go out of your way.

Sounds harsh but nobody is babying you while you take care of the family. 
***********

Some days I’m so depressed I literally can’t move. It takes every ounce of whatever I can scrounge up to pull myself up to take care of my responsibilities. 

But I get up. 

I wanted to relax this weekend but I have a sick kid and I refuse to sit around while they suffer even though I’m maxed out and dying for some rest. 

I’m on my computer for work every morning at 6 am til 1430 and the three kids need food and baths and help with schoolwork and baby needs changing. Right now my baby is asleep on me and I’d rather be laying here relaxing. 

I’m not allowed to check out as a parent. Nobody is allowed to check out when they have kids. Not an excuse!"

By responsibilities I mean, our son. He talks a lot of shit about loving him and what not so when it comes down to it, he needs to back up what he says he will do. 

I’m normally not a hard person, or hard on people. But he’s hard on me. And I had enough."

After we split the first (big breakup) time, we ended up back “together”. We were together for days at a time like you said. Going places, ordering food or cooking together, shopping, hanging out at my house for whole weekends, usually every weekday...he barely missed any time at my home. 

It surprised me when he suddenly said that  he didn’t know me and that we weren’t really friends. He told me I never told him we were friends. I said well it was kind of just implied by these loads of time together. Then I had to explain how you don’t have to ask someone to be your friend it just happens (usually). 

It hurt, sure, but it also showed me that he has huge boundaries up and that he still felt like everything we had been through together meant nothing (we have a son). 

But yeh he totally downplayed us. We were a couple in every sense of the word, except in name on our second go round of it. 

Then he tried to ask me several times to be his girlfriend only to not act different. I had said no anyway, turned him down hard using his own words against him. Well we’re nothing right? I’m nothing?"

I hope things are better for you now. I know it can take years to undo what’s been done. 

I went to a fundamentalist Calvinist cult for 5 years that I left in 2016. I grew up in a “Christian” home and church, but it wasn’t as extreme as yours. 

What are your beliefs now? I still believe in God but I’m questioning most of what I’ve been taught (that God is righteous even when he allows innocent children to be raped and murdered; suffering is from God; God is a jealous God; preachers like John Piper and Paul Washer and the like; the village church in Texas and John MacArthurs teachings and church covering up rapes in his college).

Your mood can be severely affected, especially because of that rush Of oxytocin you get from the narc when they hoover or love bomb you after a devaluation. 

I would encourage you to google oxytocin trauma bond. There are many articles and journals that could explain a lot.

Give yourself tons of slack. You have experienced trauma. It is difficult to bounce back after. There is no set time in which you must get over it.

Then I pretty much begged him to show up (didn’t realize he was a narc til after it all happened) and he showed up crying, saying I reminded him of his ex who would break up with him and then take him back. We had not had any interactions like that. It was an excuse. 

He said he couldn’t go in with me. He wouldn’t hug me or touch me like before. It wasn’t until later after doing some reading I realized what had happened.

NarcissisticAbuse,fp5fmun,t3_gbabh1,1588327602.0,"The first time we met in person, he flew to meet me because we lived in different states. I thought we would hug upon meeting but he did a cool walk by as if he was too good for that. I mean, big moment, meeting for the first time at the airport? Supposedly we were excited to  see each other after meeting online and video chatting for weeks?  I expected a hug but got a smug smile and a walk by and he started complaining about where I live. 

The first thing he said was that he didn’t like the place. I used to live in a small southern town and he lived in an area where Philadelphia was 20 mins away and NY about an hour. He would complain for the entire weekend about the city I live in and that it’s bullshit, the food places are bullshit, etc. 

Then when we got to my car, he immediately got on his phone and was looking at Instagram and messaging his sister or whoever he was talking to at that time. I remember feeling let down about the hug and also that he was ignoring me on our first time meeting by being on his phone 5 minutes after we “met”. 

But of course he was. 


The second thing happened about 2 months in. We continued to see each other. I started going to Jersey to see him on weekends. I got a babysitter and took a Friday off to go see him, because we were so star struck and so connected (yeh right, he manufactured that). I started growing wary of him because I have a strong intuition and my gut was telling me something was off with him, so I remember arguing about his phone, why it was so private And why was he always hiding it or being secretive with it.

he willingly showed me (later realized this was on purpose) emails from sex sites he was getting, telling me he didn’t know why he still got those Bc he doesn’t use those sites anymore. Also, he kept receiving messages from his ex. He said she wouldn’t leave him alone and she was crazy. Of course she was crazy! He made her that way. He also had a “best friend” who is a girl who lives in California. He used her in triangulation with me. 

Also at About 2 months in, he had already told me he loved me. I was on top of the world. It felt surreal. He had asked me to be his girlfriend despite us having agreed to stay friends with benefits. He wouldn’t be specific when I asked him why he called me his love and I didn’t want to believe it but the attention felt so good. He made me feel super special and did nice gestures that I realized later were calculated. Bought me flowers, made it seem like he wanted to pay for everything, would put gas in my car, his apartment was super clean whenever I would visit, a towel for me,  special food, we watched movies together, had lots and lots of wild sex, drank together....but all that started to wane and the cycle of love bomb, devalue and discard became a theme in our

That first time we met I KNEW it wasn’t right thst after all the anticipation and talking and planning we had done, that not getting a hug was just off and then him being on his phone ignoring me.  

I wish I had listened to myself when something told me just leave his ass at the airport, he’s rude. I told myself no because I had planned that weekend to be with him only, had a baby sitter, and was looking forward to just being with him.

We share a child so it’s hard to get away. We aren’t in a relationship but he stays at my house a lot to be with his son and lately I’ve been wanting to be away from him and feeling done."
NarcissisticAbuse,fp4xqf0,t3_gb8f3l,1588310203.0,"You are a successful young man and deserve much much better than to be treated like a secret in the attic. Your requests are reasonable and her behavior is ridiculous. You can treat yourself to your own apartment and be able to do what you want and be comfortable again. Watch tv! Work in any floor. 

I’ve been through this kind of thing twice and the only way it gets better is To separate. Plain and simple. 

Get out before things get much much worse. You’re her dumping ground, her punching bag. 

And fuck the love stuff, narcs aren’t capable of love. She was just faking it all at the beginning, and it sounds like she didn’t try very hard to begin with. 

You deserve better! You deserve the best! 

I’m finally almost totally out of this situationship and I see how very low my expectations and standards were that I ended up with someone like that. 

Get out ASAP. Is your name on the lease? You could just quietly sneak out when her parents come and never go back and just move to a new place, change your phone and start over."

Fuck those people who think they’re better than you or that you’re wrong for loving another human being. She’s sinning by treating you that way. Jesus wouldn’t do that, but his followers would. 
She doesn’t deserve you at this point. She needs to learn something."

My kids run in the house sometimes and I hate it. I keep my older two busy with videos if I have to make calls; sometimes I just have to put the baby in his pak n play and put the other two in their room;

Just so you know, I despise noise. I have a fight or flight response to them. They make me angry as well. I was in the military and loud noises set me off into an anxiety attack. So trust me I understand. 

Just here to say I’m sorry and I feel your pain."

Don’t feed the trolls, they say.

He even told me to leave one of his exes alone (even though I wasn’t contacting her, lol) because she was a business partner. Lmfao. He accused me of sending pictures of him and his son to her on WhatsApp, but I don’t even have her phone number. I had no interest in talking to her. He accused me of several things with her, probably because he lied to her and told her I’m crazy. Lol. He “omitted” the part where he made me crazy 😜"

Don’t react to the narc. He wants a reaction. Or if you’re really zany like me, just laugh uncontrollably and hang up"
