OldSchoolCool,fmp1zf2,t3_frvo8p,1586272882.0,"i’m related to him on my dads side, my dads last name is glezos (a super common greek name) and my grandpa dennis glezos (his father and the rest of his family are all fully greek and) who recently passed away a couple years ago to cancer told us stories about him. i went to greece with my dad after he passed away to meet some of our greek cousins that we’ve never met or known and it was really fun, we ended up up meeting one sweet lady that was one of my dads distant cousins and she was nice but it was difficult to talk because she only spoke greek and needed someone to translate for us lol. we really wanted to meet him and bring him some nice wine and talk to him but we couldn’t reach him or find him. we went to apiranthos which is the village that he lives or lived in, in naxos and it was beautiful and saw his name on a cool statue. he’s a legend and his legacy will live on forever."

relationship_advice,eyjgkkh,t3_cx82kv,1567118776.0,just sit down with him and tell him how you feel. tell him that it’s serious and that it makes you feel weird and uncomfortable when he disagrees with someone and it creates a certain atmosphere. it seems like he’s just passionate and likes to talk about it and to take the piss a bit so maybe he doesn’t even really know that he’s making people feel a lil weird. if he really loves you he’ll put an effort into talking about it less with certain people

relationship_advice,ey9ly2p,t3_cwb8g9,1566946554.0,the fact that she blames it on you is so unfair. being insecure is a very personal thing and she can’t blame it on you or rely on you for those compliments she demands to feel better about herself. it’s something that she needs to try to improve herself. and it seems pretty rude that she makes those comments about your female friends too. and seriously i think you should take the job offer. don’t turn down an big opportunity for a reason like that

relationship_advice,ew148rn,t1_ew13za3,1565014762.0,i’m not sure honestly. i’m sure that he cares but he’s kinda a lazy person. i guess he thinks they’re a little unreasonable
