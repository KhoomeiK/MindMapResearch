relationship_advice,fr21b7t,t3_gm7omk,1589829448.0,"A person's diet is their own. Is it unhealthy, yes probably. They aren't going to change their diet unless they want to and making comments such as ""I'm wanting to watch my carbs"" or ""I want to eat healthy"" is probably hinting enough at the topic. I'm curious how it affects your diet though. Again, your diet is your own. If you wanna eat healthy sometimes you gotta push yourself a little harder. I do the same thing with my husband. We have 100% different body types. He eats like complete junk but maintains a rather healthy weight. If I even look at a donut I gain 30 lbs. I wouldn't push a diet on them. That could cause resentment. If they want to diet, they will."

AmItheAsshole,foijpuc,t3_g7n63v,1587788365.0,"NTA BUT, when it comes to custody and mediation you have no grounds to be part of that. I promise you I'm not saying that to be rude. I've been in your exact situation. The best way to handle those 2 topics specifically is have conversations with your husband about agreements or ideas ahead of court dates or mediation dates. Have an open conversation and an open mind with him. Where I live, mom doesnt have to even allow you in the mediation meeting. Your opinion should matter to your husband but they are his kids and he has the last say on what he wants with them in custody arrangements. As for parent teacher conferences, it's kind of the same. It has to be agreed upon for you to be part of them. Being a step parent is a thankless job and it will most likely hurt your feelings often. Just remember, you're loving these kiddos that aren't yours and your opinion should matter to your husband. If they don't, there are bigger issues. I know this probably doesn't help very much. Check out the step parents sub too. There is a lot of support there. Good luck to you bonus mama!"

It could have been all of those things he said was happening plus the nerves of being with someone he may have thought was out of his league. My suggestion, make it a relaxing experience if you choose to have a redo. Have a glass of wine with him ahead of time, take extra time with a nice makeout session, let him warm you up with some foreplay before you go down on him. Women normally take more time to orgasm to begin with. I read somewhere the average time it takes a man to orgasm is like 4-7 minutes. And sure he might need to masturbate ahead of time to be able to perform better in bed. If he's prepared and you guys end up having a redo it might turn out to be some really great sex."
Custody,fed6xxn,t1_fecs4fi,1579001794.0,Yes a court ordered evaluation
Custody,fe94cnr,t1_fe93zq6,1578934110.0,"I agree with you. But, we went through every resource there was and she was still allowed visitation. She does live far away so that is a positive. I just hurt so much for my stepkiddos. They are being made to believe so many untrue things and it messes with their little brains. Sad."
Custody,fe92tf9,t3_eo658s,1578933586.0,"All were done by mother yes. And all have proven to be true. The sexual abuse was not molestation or rape. It was allowing and encouraging a 9 year old to watch porn, sexual act being performed in front of the kids. That is why the visitations are extremely limited."
Custody,fe8y2mq,t3_ensnbu,1578932234.0,"We went through a custody evaluation about 4 years ago. They are INTENSE but absolutely needed. Ours included psych evals, individual interviews of each member of the family including the kids, play sessions with each parent and investigation into any concerns there may be. They are expensive just to warn you. Ours was about $11,000. But again, absolutely worth it and needed. The person performing them is well qualified to conduct them and will put the kid(s) in the right environment for them."
Parenting,fe681yc,t3_envvhl,1578883841.0,One of my children went into a full panic because she watched the news while with my mother. The news article stated that children who get measles are more likely to die. I had to explain to her that that is why she got her shots. Another time she went into a panic because it was supposed to be super windy. She's no longer allowed to watch the news.
relationship_advice,fe47onc,t3_enmw2v,1578856506.0,"If she doesn't respect the fact that you need sleep but you respect her space when needed, that's saying something. Her needs are more important than yours in her mind, and that's not how a healthy relationship works."
BipolarReddit,fdkwuti,t3_elxg8s,1578512810.0,That's how I've been as well. I WAS excited until I called the pharmacy. My copay is $100! Dang.
Custody,fdi0c0k,t3_eli4hp,1578433455.0,"Per the IRS webpage, if she is not claiming him on her taxes you get to. Not her boyfriend, he is not the custodial or non custodial parent. You can ask for a modification to bring it before the judge and explain the situation."
raisedbynarcissists,fdh3puj,t1_fdh3m1y,1578414717.0,Thank you. She taught how not to be a stepmother. All 4 of my kids both step and bio are the best things to ever happen to me.
Custody,fdh0co1,t3_el8nle,1578412608.0,In my state the courts can have the sheriff's dept serve documents for like $25. Is that available for you? You don't have to notify her that you're going to serve her and it's probably best that you dont since she has allowed there to be no contact with your kiddo. It could make the serving process harder for you if she is aware.
Custody,fdfd7se,t1_fdfc44t,1578358943.0,"If he genuinely doesn't care that you are going to divorce him and doesnt want custody or visitation with your son then he will have made his choice and it sounds like you have made yours. I wish you the best of luck. Maybe he will see what he is missing once you file. Hopefully at least for your son. I'm sorry you are going through all of this. I'm not sure how it is in your state, but in mine you have to have permission from the other parent and/or the court to move to another state. Be prepared for that. The judge may not want to uproot your son from his family home."
Custody,fdfbgu4,t1_fdfandw,1578357762.0,Your son would absolutely notice a difference and it's really sad that you say that. Maybe you should talk to your husband about spending more time with your son. Tell him what is at risk. Give him the chance to change his ways.
Custody,fdf9njr,t1_fdf9c6h,1578356548.0,"That doesn't mean he deserves his son to be moved several states away. Your son deserves to have his father in his life. Unless your husband doesn't want that or he is abusing your son, there is no reason why he shouldn't be allowed to see his son on a regular basis."
aww,fdew7hp,t3_ekwka8,1578347880.0,Oh. My. SQUIIIISSSHHHHYYYYY!
