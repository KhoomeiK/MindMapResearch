Your boyfriend seems to have some issues of his own. To be honest, I could imagine myself feeling the same insecurity and jealousy he did (which is of course, wrong). But the way he chose to act on those feelings is something that you do not deserve.

The homeworks are essentially just quizzes. You could do some of the simulation parts in the language of your choice. But there are several questions which specifically require you to use Arena (eg.

Edit: So it seems the office of graduate studies will send a mail/update the checklist while processing our application and indicate which documents they require. The admission will be put on hold till they receive them. Apparently, it can take a month or more to get that mail.

Some folks proactively sent their transcripts after receiving the departmental acceptance (and a few later found out that they didn't have to). It seems the best thing to do is proactively send them in.
