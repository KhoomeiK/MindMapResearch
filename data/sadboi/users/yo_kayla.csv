I would second many others and suggest getting a second opinion and look for a certified canine behaviorist or contact a local shelter's behavior department. There are many trainers out there that still use old school, abusive technology such as shock collars, but put the word positive in there somewhere like they know what they're talking about. A shock collar is not positive reinforcement, it is positive punishment. You are adding (+) something aversive (shock) to discourage behavior. This can be frightening, painful and very frustrating for all animals because it is a difficult (and sometimes impossible) way to communicate. Positive reinforcement is when you add (+) something reinforcing like a piece of tasty food, increasing the likelihood the behavior will repeat itself. If you enjoy reading, check out the book ""Don't Shoot the Dog"" by Karen Pryor or visit clickertraining.com.

As an animal care professional I cannot say thank you enough for trying to help your dog. So many give up too soon. I wish you all the best and I hope you and your family can find some peace. They're all good dogs. ✌🏻🐕"

Ornithology,erj0jne,t3_c2a15c,1560912234.0,"If you haven't already, I'd suggest incorporating native vegetation such as: trees, shrubs and wildflowers that thrive in your area and provide options to encourage these species to gather and feed. 

Placing feeders with desired foods items for white and red breasted nuthatches is a great way to initiate traffic to your yard and (hopefully) nestbox(es) as well. 

I've had good luck exploring Reddit and The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's pages to find information on how to increase traffic of various species to my own yard. Understanding the natural history of the species will help you the most.

My changes included type of seed(s) fed and trees to plant. We added a couple fruit trees (peach and mulberry) and primarily feed black sunflower seeds and suet. 

Best of luck getting those birbs to your box(es) and thank you for loving birds!"
