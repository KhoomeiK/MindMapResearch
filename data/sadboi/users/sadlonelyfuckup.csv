It's like a house you spot on a rainy day while walking home, it looks great outside and you think ""Hey this looks good, i'll get in bc the rain is too much"". You ignore the voices of the ppl who are or have been inside telling you to stay away and you step in. Once inside a bad smell hits your nose, the house is ready to fall apart, dead rats everywhere, water dripping through the roof and floors. But it's raining out so you say ""I'll stay until the rain stops"". That turns into, tomorrow, next week, next month etc until you realise the rain wont fucking stop and you're left sobbing in a dark corner with wet walls that smell like mold. ""fuck, this is worse than walking in the rain"" you think. ""I need to get out"" but you notice there is no way out, smth collapsed and covered the exit. You try to move whatever is blocking the door but it's hard, it seems impossible. From there you have 2 choices, you go back in the moldy corner and cry forever or get cuts, fractured bones and bruises to free the exit and get out. The 2nd choice is tiring, harder and it will hurt but you'll be out eventually and on your way home again. The rain wont stop, you dont know how long the walk is but you know you'll get there so you keep walking through snow,  heatwaves, cold, and tornadoes. There's gon be a bunch of houses along the way like the one you were trapped in but now you know, now you listen to those voices and walk straight, no stops, no pauses"
