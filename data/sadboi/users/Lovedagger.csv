My Nmom played the obvious character. The way she always sabotaged Cinderella's happiness and her weird jealousy. 

The stepsister's were my bratty GC brother who didn't know how much he was being played by her and took so much sick joy in watching me suffer.

The Fairy Godmother was my grandma 😊

My Edad worked nights so he was almost never there. And when he was he wanted to be left alone. 

Even the whole endless chores thing, I could relate to. (Nothing wrong with kids doing chores) but, this was a different level. Almost a way to ""put me in my place"" It was all so demeaning. 

I cleaned the kitchen every night after dinner (in a normal family this wouldn't be unusual) but, I swear my Nmom made way bigger messes on purpose. Used so many dishes just to make a simple meal. NEVER ""clean as you go"" like seriously,  how can it look like a hand grenade went off after making tacos!?!?

Breakfast was another huge mess that was waiting for me after school. My Nmom and GC brother made the biggest mess just by making toast! Nothing was put back, dishes left out instead of putting them in the sink like a normal person. God forbid,  they actually put something in the dishwasher. I could never go to a friend's house after school or anything like that because I had to clean up after them by the time Nmom got home from work. 

GC brother had to vacuum the living room once a day! 5 minutes! Big deal!

Another time one of my customers asked if I could take on some extra work. I was already swamped and didn't want to stress myself out. The old me would have either taken it on and regretted it later or said ""I'm sorry, I don't have the time, I'm sorry,  I would if I could"",  blah blah blah. 

Instead I said ""thank you for thinking of me and the opportunity for more work but, I don't have the time right now""

He was always the ""nice"" and ""sane"" one but, the more I work on self love, the more I see he was just as bad. Hyper critical and always angry. 

My Nmom always put it my GC brother's mind that our father favored me and liked me more. Which is total bull shit but, my brother believed it and hated me ever since. So to assure my bratty GC brother that wasn't true my Edad would purposely put me down,  blame me for everything,  criticize me all in front of my brother to make him feel better. 

I'm convinced he's just as toxic. My parents never should have had kids. 

Oh, my dad also likes to tell this ""joke"" about how when I was young,  i apparently said out of frustration one day, ""i didn't ask to be born"" his response was ""good, cause the answer would have been no"""
raisedbynarcissists,fpdp34w,t3_gcnd6y,1588531384.0,"I mentioned this on another post that just because they did the bare minimum so that CPS wouldn't be called, they think they were actually good parents. 

I come from a middle class upbringing, nice houses, plenty of food, Christmases and birthdays were celebrated with many maternal items, vacations to exciting places every year, we had our own bedrooms, good schools,  etc etc etc. 

Neither of my parents abused drugs or alcohol (although Nmom's medicine cabinet was and is always full of prescriptions) 

My parents appearances were and still are clean cut, wholesome and generally all around pleasant. 

No one would EVER believe the horrors that went on inside those beautiful homes with perfect manicured lawns. 

Its actually the perfect disguise for an abusive, manipulative, lying, miserable, sadistic monster of a parent!"

raisedbynarcissists,fpdnd7a,t1_fpd2a02,1588530409.0,Thank you for sharing 💕😊
raisedbynarcissists,fpdhugp,t1_fpde7dj,1588527280.0,"Thank you. Yes my Nmom is also all about appearances and looking ""proper"" to the outside world. 

Since she didn't actually show the picture, my family probably just assumed I thought it was an unflattering picture, like messy hair or something? Therefore,  making me look ""dramatic"" and ungrateful just as she said. 

I certainly wasn't going to tell my family it was a naked picture. I was way too embarrassed. So once again,  I look like a brat and she looks like the thoughtful mother who gives so many wonderful gifts like a Polaroid camera at Christmas. 

Ugh! I'm so glad I'm away from that. Best of luck to you in your healing journey. I hope we all find the happiness and peace we deserve 💕

p.s. yes, if I had locked the door she would have pounded on it and made a big deal about why I needed to lock the door and ""what are you doing in there"" drawing even more attention. Lol. You can never win with a narc"
raisedbynarcissists,fpdgb2w,t1_fpd3gnd,1588526423.0,"Yes. I know that feeling all too well. There were instances I could literally feel the tension as soon as I was in the same room. It's a sick feeling in the gut, then when I saw the facial expression I was like ""oh shit! Here we go"" 

Its something you can't explain in words.

Edit: their voices change also. To the outside world,  she talks so soft and polite. Tons of compliments and gentle laughter. 

Behind closed doors it's yelling and screeching insults with obscenities thrown around."
raisedbynarcissists,fpdeqi4,t3_gcpt9u,1588525546.0,"OMG! Wow! I seriously thought my Nmom was a special kind of sick when it came to this. 

Yes! She farts like a dinosaur and laughs about it like a toddler. 

She also uses the toilet with the door open and talks about her bowel movements in great detail. 

A few years back in a car drive while visiting my aunt, a bunch of us were in the car including her partner who was driving. She was in a particular nasty mood and talked about how a couple weeks ago she shit her pants and it was running down her leg and onto her foot. Her partner looked particularly disgusted and embarrassed and asked her to stop. Then she seemed so proud of herself and stated, ""hee hee,  did I gross you all out"" She had this big crazy smile 🤪

Yes, we were all grossed out and kept saying, stop! Eeeew! 🤮

The ironic part is she did it to get a rise out of everyone but, it just made her look all the more crazy and pathetic. 

A part of me felt sorry for her because her plan was backfiring so spectacularly. She thought she was making us uncomfortable (which brings her so much pleasure) but, she was actually making herself look so insane. 

In public settings like a department store for example,  she will ask to use the bathroom because she's going to ""shit her pants"" 

Like, just say ""May I use the restroom"" and leave it at that. Gawd!!! 

I seriously thought I was the only one who witnessed this bizarre behavior. I swear these narcs all use the same handbook. 

The weirdest part is her appearance is always so immaculate and clean. Totally polished and put together which makes it even more jarring because it's so unexpected."
raisedbynarcissists,fpdcjvn,t3_gcq0e0,1588524314.0,"Oh yes. I trust absolutely no one in my family anymore. Nmom is so sneaky and manipulative that she can get people to tell her things about me (just so she can sabotage my happiness) without them even realizing they were played. 

She does it under the guise of being ""so worried"" about me. 

Flying monkeys everywhere. Its definitely made me a little paranoid."
raisedbynarcissists,fpdboop,t3_gcq3rx,1588523822.0,"Don't feel bad for voicing your unfair treatment just because they gave you food and shelter. 

So they did the bare minimum to avoid trouble from CPS? Big deal!! Mine did also. 

You deserve a nurturing and loving upbringing. You deserve to be treated with respect and not mocked and belittled constantly. 

Sounds like your dad is definitely a narcissist.  They absolutely MUST have someone to degrade and abuse because they hate themselves so much. They have to sabotage every chance you get for happiness. It's all about supply and sucking your soul dry. These people have no soul so they have to steal yours. Its literally survival for them. 

Unfortunately for us, these monsters are disguised as parents which makes it all the more painful and horrifying. 

They also use triangulation with siblings which is probably why the relationship with your sister is so strained. My Nmom destroyed the relationship with my only sibling due to triangulation. Our relationship is beyond repair.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. 

You are valuable and worthy!! That's why the narcissist must destroy your confidence. They want to destroy what they can't have. It's a sick game. 

I wish you all the best. Don't ever forget,  you are a big deal!! You deserve a happy life full of healthy, loving relationships  🦋💖💖💖"

Take care and be safe. I wish you all the best 😊💕🦋"
raisedbynarcissists,fpd4z1i,t3_gcrl4i,1588519940.0,"I experienced some really weird behavior also. It was really uncomfortable. 

I developed fast but it was my chest area. It was a confusing time like it is for most kids. My body looked like a woman but, I still felt like a kid if that makes sense. 

She would stare and I mean STARE at my large developing chest at the dinner table. It felt so weird and even dirty. I wanted to scream,  ""Yes, I have boobs, stop staring!!""

She would make me wear really loose clothing to hide them so I always kinda felt ashamed even though growing breasts are totally normal for a female. 

One particular incident was especially disturbing when I was only 12 years old. That was when my chest started developing. And fast! 

It was Christmas morning and I got a Polaroid camera and bubble bath among other things. I went to take a bath to use my new bath stuff and get ready to go to the grandparents. 

After my bath my Nmom bursts in with my camera and takes a picture of me naked. I was absolutely HORRIFIED!! I begged her to throw it away. She laughed and told me to stop being so dramatic. 

Fast forward to being at my grandparents house. Everyone was there. Aunts and their husbands, uncles,  cousins,  the whole family. 

I had pretty much forgotten the picture when suddenly she says ""(insert my name here) should we show everyone your picture from this morning?"" 

I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. I said ""nooooo please, noooo"" she laughed again at how ""dramatic"" I was being and how I always had to ""ruin Christmas ""  I was so scared and anxious the rest of the day she would show it to everyone. Literally I was sick to my stomach. 

Looking back, of course she would have never shown it because its totally illegal to show naked pictures of minors but, she made damn sure I was sick with fear that she might. 

She also had this weird thing about bursting in the bathroom whenever I bathed or was using the toilet. 

She also liked to leave the door open after she burst in when company was over. 

I am now an adult and have been for years. The last time I was at her house was about a year ago. I was using the guest bathroom toilet and she opens the door and says ""your dog wants you"" like seriously,  wtf??? Her male partner was just a few feet away. I knew then and there I would never give her the chance to humiliate me again!! 

Seems like a small thing to break the camel's back but, I've absolutely had it!! Privacy and boundaries mean nothing to her. 

I know with every cell in my body she purposely did it just to make me uncomfortable. 

Sorry for what you've had to experience with your Nmom. These people are so sick and twisted and no one deserves to be humiliated because of their perfectly normal growing body. 

Wishing you all the best 💕🦋💖

Edit: locking bathroom doors were absolutely not allowed! I guess I should have as an adult guest in her house but, I really didn't think she'd do it with her partner right outside the door."
raisedbynarcissists,fpd23uh,t1_fpd1i95,1588518199.0,"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You have no idea what a relief it is hearing that. 

Sub question if you have a minute? 

I want to make a YouTube channel about surviving a narcissist parent. I have alot of experience.  

If I make a completely different email especially for that, can my name be traced? I don't plan on showing my face,  at least not at first but, I'm assuming I would have to give my full name to set up the account. 

Thanks again for taking the time to answer my initial question. Wishing you all the best 🦋💖"

I also don't appreciate how all she wants is for me to be happy. (((((HUUUUURLLLL))))) 🤣🤮 yeah, that's why she always turned the card over to see how much I spent. She never understood the value of a homemade card I used to make when I was little. Something a normal parent would cherish. 

Oh in answer to OP's question, I think I'll get a pizza and watch a movie ALONE AND IN PEACE 😁🍕❤"
raisedbynarcissists,fpczzwd,t1_fpcy99c,1588516853.0,That's so great you are away from that and living with a healthy minded parent. Good for you! I don't have to tell you how peaceful being away from the narc is. Lol. CHEERS!! 😁🥂💕
raisedbynarcissists,fpcy2zn,t3_gcov1v,1588515609.0,"Yes. I am the scapegoat and my brother is the golden child. Its typical in narc families. The narsissist HAS to have someone to project and blame everything on and that is the scapegoat. 

Usually the narcissist will destroy the sibling relationships with triangulation.

In my experience there is absolutely no point in trying to reason with a narc. You'd have better luck talking to a brick wall. 

I'm so sorry you're feelings aren't validated. I understand all too well how horrible that feels.

If you really want to stick it to him, heal and live the best and happiest life you can. They absolutely hate that more than anything. 💖🦋

p.s. if you can, 'GREY ROCK'  it from now on as much as possible. Don't give him any ammunition to use against you in the future. I learned this way too late. Best of luck"

raisedbynarcissists,fpc8hwu,t3_gbz4uf,1588491230.0,"I don't know how much this will help but, it helped me when I was in that position years ago. 

Imagine that she's that ""drunk friend "" at the party that can't be reasoned with. Just agree and know she'll eventually sleep it off. Don't take anything she says seriously or personally (I know,  so much easier said than done, believe me, I get it)

Also,  another thing I used to do is imagine the peaceful life I will have once I escape. Just imagine ANYTHING positive in that moment. Even if its just sleeping on a cot in a one room space. At least it will be YOUR space. 

I used to even imagine what my first meal will be, even if it's top ramen. Imagine how good that's going to taste when you're free.

Believe me,  I know it's hard and I know that being agreeable and indifferent to a narcissist sometimes makes them want to fight even more. 

I'm so sorry you're going through this. Just keep moving forward and know that one day you'll be free. 

You're working hard every day and that's something to be proud of. Even if she can't see it. 

I wish you all the best 🦋💖"

One time I noticed a cute guy outside of the grocery store and mentioned I thought he was cute. She turns to me and says, ""Ugh, do you think he even has a f****** brain?""  That was an especially happy moment for her. She got to insult my taste in men AND a total stranger in the same breath.
