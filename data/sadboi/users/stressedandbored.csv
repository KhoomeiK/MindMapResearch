limerence,fcatu79,t3_egwsol,1577576491.0,Or how about when I go on a relationship advice-related subreddit and am hoping his gf or himself is the one posting about their personal problems which means things are getting rocky and I can slide right in?
limerence,fcatf2i,t1_fc8npfo,1577576258.0,"I think now that I am self aware of limerence, it makes me feel like I've been possessed by someone crazier than myself. Like some crazy person has hijacked my body and I don't know who they are? I've considered ways of trying to deal with it but it always comes back to hoping one day he will just give me a chance and how I do literally find him insanely attractive, and if he does give me a chance and I get bored, then I can start to heal. I definitely agree with the unworthiness of happiness feelings. I've had chronic depression for most of my life if not all, and wonder what happiness is. Maybe my psyche subtly doomed my once healthy relationship right from the start? I always want what I can't have. If someone wants to have sex with me then the chase is already over. I need everyone to want me and to see I am more than painfully average. I am almost worse than a cheater since this LO consumed me for two years and counting. It was a slow spiral out of control where this person unknowingly stole all of my romantic thoughts."

I have a lot of mental health issues but he always stood by me. In some ways I feel like I pushed him away, but I think it was meant to happen. If I can gain such obsession over someone I don't even know, then my ex deserves better than myself anyway. Even if I go NC with my LO, it will just transfer to someone else. My ex doesn't deserve to watch this happen to me over and over. ""But for some reason it wasn't enough for me at the time"" really resonates with me. Maybe it's my own way of telling myself that I am the one not good enough. Now I spend my free time searching online dating sites and Reddit for validation that I no longer get from him. I felt like I used him for validation. Limerence seems to be such a subtle but deeply anchored problem within the self. I don't know how to untangle all of this."

I am going to try keep my head out of it and forget about him the best I can. No I don't want him to cheat.

limerence,f7x1xa9,t1_f7t9jhv,1574044067.0,"Aww, it makes me happy that you care, but don't worry. I just talk that way and wouldn't actually do anything. It's scary how the original post that you linked to describes something I could have written verbatim if two weeks was replaced with two years. I can understand a HL's concerns as I have been the sexually frustrated one in past relationships, but they take it to a new level.

Depression can be a libido killer but there's no real way for me to see where the issues actually stem from. Depression seems to be linked to everything though and once it starts it seeps into every aspect of life and then whenever my problems come up my ex mentions the depression. Once depression touches you with it's cold hand it's like you've been cursed for life.

Now that the day is ending it is starting to sting inside my head that my coworker probably drove to see that girl tonight and for the next few days and is probably snuggled up in bed with her. I've been trying really hard to stay distracted but it still comes back.

That post is helpful but I already knew that I know barely anything about him. I think a lot of it is what I project onto him as a person that doesn't actually exist. In my head he is everything I want him to be, and if I think he wears black socks with black sneakers then my mind will make it ""true"". It almost upsets me that I don't know these things about him.

I need to fill the void. It's like now that my happy fantasy thoughts are shattered, my brain has no base thought to return to other than my typical negative thoughts. The fantasy was a shadowed negative thought this whole time."
limerence,f7ph38n,t1_f7dazxx,1573949244.0,"I have a history of suicidal thoughts but never act on it. I have a negative outlook on life and always have. I am here just waiting it out.

You are right that people are simply attracted to certain things, but I wanted to believe I was above the threshold of people that are more likely to be liked by someone. He doesn't smoke and the only real negative I can think of is how he is usually glued to his phone, but that's probably only because I am around. I am trying to distract myself and find any negatives about him and trying to lay low."
limerence,f7pghv8,t1_f7dfutp,1573949007.0,"I see what you mean, but still. It slowly escalated in my head over two years, yes. The whole time I fought it thinking ""I have a great boyfriend. I can't throw him away over something stupid like this"". But he wants me to get help for myself and the psychologist appointments aren't working and I felt like he can get someone who actually wants to have sex with him. R/deadbedrooms essentially always trashes the low libido person in the relationship and tells everyone to just break up and how it's so much better that way. Now, it's nice not feeling the obligation to have sex.

It was probably my mistake for telling a bunch of limerents my stories lol. I probably should have put it somewhere that non-limerent people would read it. Our brains seem to be wired to choose the most hopeful path. I still see him at work and he still talks to me but I am trying to avoid him when I can. If he asks how my day was, I just say it was fine and leave it at that. I don't think he notices me becoming standoffish and don't think he cares. Which is fine. I am just trying to stay busy as much as possible. I might work myself to death trying to stay busy as I really don't want to be inside my head anymore with my toxic thoughts. I am trying to see him for who he is without the rose-colored glasses and extrapolating any possible negatives about him.

I don't think anything will be different. I don't know how he would react if I was upfront with him, because I am thinking that maybe I haven't been as upfront with him as I thought? Ever read the posts on here where guys talk about how they missed so many signals from women and are now shaking their heads and kicking themselves years later? I wonder if it's like that.

I nitpick a lot but he made small talk with me first thing that morning and last thing at the end of the day the following day even though he didn't tell me when he was going to lunch. Sometimes it feels like we linger there together outside the building at the end of the day even if there's nothing to say before one of us says ""ok I'm gonna go"". This still would have happened if I didn't hastily rush away. I couldn't bear to look at him. It hurt too much. He shaved either that morning or the night before... \*creams pants\*"
limerence,f6nn4r3,t1_f6kqa3s,1572995237.0,"I guess I've been confused because I nitpick every conversation and action dating back two years. Like when I told him I needed to find a new place to live, he told me there is an empty apartment next to his, or that I could live in his parents' basement. Or how suddenly one day he moves from exclusively night shifts and began working the exact same day schedule 40 hours a week as mine. How in the beginning he showed me a picture of his friends and said how I could meet them someday. I have more examples but I'll shut up lol.

I think I am going to look for a new job and if I find one, on my last day I am going to flat out tell him I like him and for him to keep my number in case he wants it one day. This way, if we ever dated, we don't have to date as coworkers, and if he rejects me, I can begin to shift my limerence to someone new. Whats funny is I thought I had a non existent sex drive for five years, but just asking him to lunch got me turned on.

It feels good to be eye catching, but I guess I'm the obsessive type that needs to have what I want. I have a whole spectrum of self esteem ranging from rock bottom ""I am hideous"" to ""How could he not want me? My body is bangin""

I like that song too. But there's so many that resonate with me, and the more I belt it all out in the car the more intensely I feel. Isn't it also kind of attractive in a crazy person kind of way? Her songs sound so ultimately limerent to me now that I know what the word means, but if an attractive person is attached to it it's kind of hot. To be lusted over by someone obsessive."
DeadBedrooms,f6nk40x,t3_drbsy3,1572993261.0,"Dude I feel like garbage too. I also want my bf (um...friend) to find someone he doesn't have to compromise for. Despite me being single, I feel like my ""friend"" still spoils me and I feel bad and selfish. It sounds like you guys have a pretty deep connection, but if you are like my friend and I, perhaps you can stay friends like we are doing? Are you really moving home? I thought about moving home for a second but then I'd be too close to my parents. When I told my friend about my coworker it was kind of biting the bullet and I hated hurting him like that but I respect him enough to tell him the truth though. If I had kissed someone though I am not sure what I would do, it seems like a tougher situation. But a few drunken kisses is a little less embedded than two years of emotionally lusting over someone I see 30 hours a week. But both are bad. It sounds like your bf would end it though if you confessed. Can you take a break on your own for a bit to untangle the emotions? See if you guys really miss each other. See if you grow better on your own. It sounds like he is very stressed and stress can definitely kill sex drive and distract from it. Also, don't have kids just because he wants them. If you are absolutely sure you don't want them and he is absolutely sure he does want them, then that may be a bigger issue than sex. So is he saying let's stay together because it's more convenient right now? My friend told me when we first broke up that he couldn't just be my friend, but he quickly came to accept it. I pretty much agree with the other comments."

He probably never will again in fear I will ambush him again. If I ever get to leave the job I'm gonna say ""Well, I know you have a gf but I still like you so keep my number"".
