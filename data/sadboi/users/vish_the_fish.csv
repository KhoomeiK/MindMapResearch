The point is to make it clear that her abusive language won't keep you from living the way you want to.

I think it depends on each person's individual prejudices."
dankmemes,fq8qsuf,t1_fq7zt2t,1589172944.0,"I've never actually seen a character on Netflix who only talks about being gay. What's interesting abt this take is that people seem to be getting more annoyed with Netflix ""making a statement"" by shoving gay people down their throats.

On the flip side, for most of our lives gay people just weren't in most movies and TV shows. It makes sense because ""just about everybody is straight"" so they didn't even think about showing gays on TV. Not seeing gay people means most everybody thought they didn't (or shouldn't) exist. So when a gay person comes out of the closet they're met with revulsion and disgust at their deviant nature, not to mention their own self loathing. Fear of the Unknown and the Other bred homophobia. 

Netflix's ""statement"" helps introduce viewers to gay people and show them we're not freaks and monsters out to get little kids. It helps combat homophobia. Whether you think that's a worthy cause or not (or this is the way to do it) is up to you. 

I'll just say that because of homophobia, I will almost certainly never see any of my extended family ever again. So I think it's ok for us to have characters whose sole purpose is to be gay, especially when there are a ton of other shows you can watch that don't bother with the gays."

careerguidance,flxgtr5,t3_frs63f,1585582619.0,"As a junior in college, I can say that you have a lot of time to figure things out. You can start college as a biology major without having taken a single biology in high school and still graduate on time. You'll have the chance to take a couple introductory biology and engineering courses and you can choose from there based on what you like the most. Some pre-med programs are more intense than others, and some colleges, like mine, don't even have a pre-med program. My friends who plan on going to med school are chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, MCB, etc. They're taking the prerequisites to med school now, and you can speak with an advisor about all your different options. My point is that if you tried to do well, high school isn't going to lock you in to any one particular career path.

The admissions question is hard to answer because different colleges have different ways of handling admissions. Maybe someone else will have a better answer for you."
