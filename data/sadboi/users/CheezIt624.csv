lexington,fr22f6b,t1_fr21tae,1589829994.0,"I was 2006-2011, so right before you. I think it has to do with NCAA athletic rules if I had to guess. Since cheerleading technically isn‚Äôt a sport, I assumed they didn‚Äôt have to do it, but I‚Äôd happily be wrong! They should have access if they want it. Maybe another CATS person can chime in and confirm."
lexington,fr2256t,t1_fr1xeka,1589829857.0,"It‚Äôs not necessarily a private retreat though. They‚Äôre there representing the university at their team retreat. They‚Äôre doing it as UK cheerleading representatives. 

If a bunch of cheerleaders on their own time rented a lake house for fun one weekend and did this, then yeah, maybe. But if this is an official UK cheerleading event likely paid for with department money, then they‚Äôre representing the university, and drinking and being naked doesn‚Äôt fly."
lexington,fr21buu,t1_fr20ywe,1589829457.0,"Maybe that‚Äôs new? I worked at CATS for about five years and never saw a cheerleader once. It‚Äôs entirely possible that our schedules just didn‚Äôt align and I didn‚Äôt tutor the classes they were taking so I never saw them, but none of my friends ever tutored a cheerleader either."
lexington,fr1ugoi,t1_fr1ii4s,1589826147.0,"I agree. I will say the thing that I find slightly irritating about all this is that they‚Äôre adamant that the university wants to maintain the integrity of this national program, but cheerleading isn‚Äôt considered a sport. They don‚Äôt get tutoring, they get limited scholarships, and they lack the same benefits other athletes get on campus. That‚Äôs not necessarily UK‚Äôs fault, just a general statement on how cheerleading is viewed. Again, this was absolutely the right call, but the way their press release was phrased makes it sound like they value this program only because of the championships it wins.

Edit: poster below notes that cheerleaders may get tutoring, which is great! I never saw them there when I tutored but hoping they do receive access. They should."

AskReddit,fpgv7ta,t1_fpget46,1588610112.0,"But the protest rules aren‚Äôt applied the same to all Americans. And that may not exactly be the protesters‚Äô fault...but the overlap between those standing outside the governor‚Äôs office to intimidate and those who bitch when others protest is significant. So there‚Äôs lots of issues at play here. 

The people who brought their guns to the state house and got in the face of police and stood outside the governor‚Äôs office were there to threaten and intimidate. They‚Äôre not shooting the governor on site; they‚Äôre just subtly threatening her and the state government. But when people kneel during the anthem to protest police brutality or block traffic, they‚Äôre treated VERY differently, by police and by other, namely white, people. 

THAT‚ÄôS part of the reason people think these state house takeovers with guns are bullshit. It‚Äôs a not so subtle attempt to threaten individuals, and it‚Äôs a thing that ONLY (mostly) white people have the privilege of doing. Because white people, according to society, are the ‚Äúright hands‚Äù in which guns belong."
