selfimprovement,ew0htqw,t3_cm012n,1564989653.0,"I struggle with depression, too. My psychiatrist told me to build a routine that will be there whether I'm feeling a certain way or not. Leaving the wanting feeling out of the picture and perhaps working on what is objectively good for your long term mental/physical health might be helpful. Focusing on this as a first priority and the feeling second may help cultivate the wanting feeling back."

I think she could drink it but things like washing her hands, showering would burn her skin. So yeah..water intake ..good stuff!! I think I need the accountability to use a gym. What do you anticipate your gym routine to be like or what have you been doing since building it? That's a pretty big feat in itself is getting started. I find I can be pretty gung ho when I get started on things but then I get depressed."

Hey again :) I've been keeping up. Everything seems to go as well as it can be. I just had a couple of non-urgent, curious questions:

What is the optimal waiting time between eating and brushing teeth? Like how soon after should I do it and how soon is too soon.

Also, once I brush my teeth at night, will it be harmful to drink some tea (either herbal or green) or have some lemon water?

Lastly, is a cup of lemon water a day corrosive to teeth?"
selfimprovement,etw9nt7,t1_etujn63,1563259531.0,I hear ya. I've never been much into flossers. I feel like I'm just getting that little thread dirty as I run it up and down between my teeth :/ Maybe I'm doing it wrong or my teeth are too gross. I should look up some YouTube videos.

I actually teared up at this - but I also really like it: ""You may not be able to see your destination right away from where you’re at so it’s hard to imagine how you’ll get there but your headlights light the way and guide you in the right direction a little at a time until you’ve finally made it to your destination. You must trust in the small steps to guide you there and try not to think too much about the “how” you’ll get there, just trust that you will."" - I guess something I'm struggling with is not being able to predict how I'll feel later in life. I can visualize different outcomes - good..bad..but feeling seems so unpredictable and I'm just in such a messy mess, it is heartwrenching to just feel this way now and I think...I gotta feel this way for years on end? Or worse? Fuck that. But..whatever. There's a lot more to unpack with that so..just gonna focus on brushing my teeth for now."

And even if he did realize the grossness, any step away from that can be so daunting and it's also embarrassing to work towards something in a way. I dunno if that makes sense.
