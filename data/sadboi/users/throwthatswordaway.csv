It sometimes feels even worse on social media, especially Discord, when you see an amazing conversation you weren't able to be a part of.

I hate FOMO. On a bad day, it makes my already increased fear of feeling left out much worse."

a 10 team, 0.5 PPR.

This was obviously before the injury news broke, and at the time, I thought it may have been fair with the new mouths to feed in the Philly offense and my trade partner's lack of RB depth. After the injury news, I feel like I got away with robbery."

Don't think he'll be there when waivers clear. Oh well."

(Here's hoping David Carr's history with WR's not named Crabtree doesn't make me regret finally dropping Darwin Thompson for Tyrell)"

""He's safer than dealing with another Le'Veon Bell situation"", they said.

That's the last time I overthink Pick 1.05 ever again. If someone as talented as Zeke's still on the board, I take the risk."
