Competitiveoverwatch,fqeed87,t3_giaz52,1589306161.0,"I'm probably going to have a few hot takes here so bear with me:

    
I initially thought hero pools was a great thing to help shake things up.  The first week of ranked pools was fantastic.  Watching the hero pool draws for OWL and the ensuing discussion has been pretty fun through the whole thing.  But, in ranked, the pools really started to feel terrible, and I think many other people agreed, so Blizzard responded by removing the pools from diamond and below (eventually the pools will be coming back to masters and above).
    
As a viewer of OWL, I have not really enjoyed hero pools overall.  There have been some really interesting things that have happened, but I also think the level of skill that is being reached by teams is much lower than before hero pools existed.  There's a lot of games that basically just look like a top 500 game that you can watch on a streamer's channel.  I can't really tell you who the best team in the league is; it depends on the next week's hero pools.  Outside of the top few teams that generally float around in that range, the rest of the teams honestly could be ranked 7th one week and then 18th the next, all depending on the pool.  There's no narratives, no good measure of progression, and that isn't even taking into account the stress that the teams are feeling each week to prepare for the new pool.
    
Blizzard promised frequent, aggressive balance changes, and while they have been a bit more frequent than before, as of now they have not really done anything that I would call ""aggressive"".  If they got rid of pools and actually did what they said they would do, I think we'd see a certain meta develop for 2-4 weeks and then things would change as teams start to figure out new patches.  This could allow narratives to develop, which I think is one reason why I've enjoyed the previous two seasons more than this one so far.  I admit I don't like watching the same meta for months on end, but I have no issue with watching GOATs or Dive for a few weeks at a time.  Hell, Shock were able to make watching double shield entertaining through playoffs last season.
    
I really think pools should just go away in favor of Blizzard working to fulfill their promise made earlier in the year.  I'm glad to see them remove it from most of ranked, but I think it needs to go from everywhere else too."
