Harvey Whittemore was indicted in 2012 for making illegal campaign contributions.  He was the person that claimed Dr. Mikovitz stole from the institute.  Eventually the judge presiding over Dr Mikovitz’s case refused himself because he had received illegal campaign contributions from none other than Mr. Whittemore.  This is all from a NY Times article you can find on the Dr. Mikovitz Wikipedia has page.  Seems like even the institute she was working for was shady AF.

Chilling with a girl in high school
Made out, went and sat on a swing set.  She had to go home so I sat in my house alone peaking.  My parents got home late and I started getting bad anxiety.  I had a pager back then and I was paging messages back and forth with the girl I had been hanging out with.   All of a sudden I got two texts at the same time so I knew they both couldn’t have been from her.  One said “666” and the other said “999”

Fucking lost my mind.  Laid in my bed with a bible on my chest and then went and slept next to my parents bed at about 3am.  That was over 20 years ago.  Still remember it like it happened yesterday."

I’m sure Ruth’s Chris does this all the time and was way ahead of the curve.  So no all the posters whining about it are just in a literal echo chamber and have no idea what they’re talking about.

As an example my relative works for a small company (around 50-75 employees total.), but the owner is an expert is securing financing, loans etc.. They got approved for $800,000 long before Ruth’s Chris ever did.  The banking system is set up for those who know how to take advantage of it.  It has nothing to do with anything else."

Here’s the deal.  Singing is the most beautiful amazing expression you can experience and put out into this world.  It really is.  When I’ve lost all self awareness and can just let go I feel the music, it courses through my soul and my veins.

Let go of yourself, literally, when you open your mouth to sing let that be the only moment, the only sound, the only molecule in the air.  If you are thinking about ANYTHING ELSE, you are doing it wrong.  It will take a lot of practice and you will fail far more than you will succeed...until you don’t. Until you finally get it.

If you can’t afford to have a large family then definitely don’t put children through that struggle.
