worse because you have to hang out with them and act like friends even though they don't offer you things a friend should. I was trying to get out of a toxic friendship for a long time. in our relationship i was her constant emotional support and back up but she literally doesn't do anything for me, not because she's a bad person, but just because she's so used to being taken care of by someone else.
