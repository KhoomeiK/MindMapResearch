2) Russia doesn't want a military based war. With how powerful the US and Russian military are, a war would be absolutely chaotic. A war like that has no value if you cannot predict it, but power of intelligence is their game. With intelligence they are able to tell the world the truth while the US was scrambling like a chicken without a head cookin up a war. With that narrative, how powerful does Russia look? That gives Russia so much attention and recognition for what their country to do. It's not even about how many fighter jets or air ship carriers they have, yet it's so influential.

So I'm gonna give my story a bit just to give some context. I was brought up religious, I'd say similar religious level to the family you have in Israel. White shirt black pants Yeshiva, went to Israel for a year for more Yeshiva. Was ""shtiging away""... Only difference is  I knew the rabbaim well enough to know what their response/perspective would be; I listened to so many of there speeches and their ideology was just so limited, there was no room for them to fit in the answers to the questions I was asking myself. (A lot to do with Science vs Judaism rather than the structure of Judaism)

So on my own, I used to research the answers. Honestly was looking at better sources than most rabbis could have responded with so kinda happy I didn't go that route. I'm still figuring out things all the time as life is so complex but I wouldn't be where I am today without those experiences. 

I can see that you take things very fairly in life. For a person to be brought up with such freedom (relatively speaking) and sees Orthodox Judaism with all its restrictions, yet you were able to see beyond all that it may entail, for a better, more meaningful and wholesome life. So you went out and explored. You're learning about something that involves such a high magnitude of attention and integration of not only your daily life, but your core belief. If you were able to challenge that to get to this point, you'll be able to figure this one out too. 

I'd say figure out what you believe, in a totally objective sense. Take everything you can from your experience and see how it relates to you. Try doing your own research and honestly, it's really no big deal to change your opinion on things. It's hard when you are in a situation like that, where everyone is on the same page and you're the black sheep. Who cares. It may do you some good."

That being said, from what I understand about Judaism is that even the ""worst things"" are God's good will and people are suffering because we don't truly *believe* that it's God's action with good intention. I can see how they can logically come to terms with horrific life events with a very strong belief system.

To reiterate, since God is all good, even if we are suffering, maybe it's a ""construct"" of our lack of belief and that's the test God wants to put us through to build upon that belief. It is also religiously attractive since such perspective gives a stronger meaning to life and religion as a whole.

In regards to God testing us, of course god knows what our actions will be but that is likely because we will choose it. Since we are bond by the limitation of time we can't but an all knowing God would. A good analogy is a director looking at a reel of film where as we are living it frame by frame.

Edit: What I'd think the argument would be for an objective view is that moral value is derived from a godly presence. If that's the case, then you can go down the rabbit hole of whether or not good can or cannot exist without evil and whether it is actually necessary.

I'm regards to your dad, this is just an opinion but it's such a strong opinion to me that I consider it a fact. 

People don't change unless they choose too.

Your dad wanted to become religious not because you wanted him to, but because it was his conclusion. Why is this so relevant?
For loss of a better word, Bigotry. Your dad's belief is to have ""strength"" to his opinions which make them effective and reinforced. It works, and most importantly it's his belief. Doesn't matter how much you want it to change, you can try, but from my experience, most of those personal opinions always come from a private place, gives a sense of individuality.

So now you have two choices:
1) Of course you don't like that your dad is like that, it's just so unsettling. So you try figuring out. Maybe ways to approach the conversation to find some level ground. How about just keep a distance this way it won't affect you as much. 
Or... 

2) just let it be. Accept it that this is who your dad is. Your dad just happens to have harsh opinions. You don't have to be responsible for that. I mean if you end up dating a Muslim girl things will become complex, but otherwise, that's just who he is. It's easy to worry about being so closely associated with him but people with enough common sense can differentiate a father's opinion from his son's.

I get he embarrassed you but you have to understand, social skills among religious jews are not the greatest.

I know that now more than ever, and it's fine that you didn't and were curious for his opinion but what people here are trying to tell you is that's pretty much the norm between people from that kind of community.

Another point, when a religious jew gives a religious article such as teffilin, they don't give it with the intention that it is a gift, to them, it's a necessity, and they are giving it to you more or less under that condition.

exjew,fmr3h2c,t1_fmq8ycu,1586313005.0,"So the way Orthodoxy is structured is more organized towards a *basis of ruling* rather than a higher power's preference.

And I think this ties into what you are addressing as well as the original post. Every law that Judaism has can be looked through two very different lens. One of ""this is the Torah, it's just the way it is"" and the other, ""God  wants us to follow his word because of its deeper meaning"".

The former ideology has this more stoic approach. For example, brushing your teeth on shabbat. Of course the logical thing to do is to be healthy and brush, but God wants one to manage it in a different way. So said person goes out and investigates what his options are and buys the special tooth brush and perhaps tries a different toothpaste as well. For him/her, there is no logic of why not to brush my teeth, it's how is my life different to include God's ruling.

This concept is what I believe is the end of the moral philosophy against anything we'd consider wrong or cruel which Judaism demands. ""it's just the law and it's our responsibility to make it work"".

Between these two perspectives, Jews often choose which applies when. Religion needs to be sentimental for it to make sense; so that's why the latter exists and the former must exist in order to make it all possible.

That being said, with this approach I feel that, intrinsically, Judaism makes it very difficult to practice in an unbroken manner but I do believe there are people out there that are still practicing Judaism and truly are trying their best. We may not hear from them here, mainly becuase very few of us in this subreddit practice it in a mature fashion which we can compare to."

A little story to get my point across:
One Friday night I was with a friend on a casual walk in the streets of Brooklyn. Coincidently enough, a Jewish couple was waiting outside looking for a shabbos goy and asked us if we can turn on/off the stove for them. I replied first saying that I don't think you want us to do that, we're Jewish. They were apologetic and so on and we went our separate ways.
Afterwards my friend asks me why didn't we just go in and do them the favor?
I thought about it and I quickly realized we were in two very different mindsets. I was thinking that I'm doing them good by being honest and avoiding putting them in a situation which would be unfavorable to them. He was thinking well, it doesn't matter what they think, just go and help them if no harm is done, they'll never know and life moves on.

I still don't know what was the right thing to do. I think we both make good points but just shows how two totally opposite scenarios can both have good motives. 

Do what feels right to you."

When I say something along the lines of me not believing in God, a common response is ""well how can you be sure there is no god"" and I'm like ""what?! That's exactly my point, I'm not sure, how are you so sure you revolve your life around the ""fact"" there is one with little no basis?!"" So hypocritical and they don't even see it."

All of us here have our own story. All different but I have felt the same way for song long. Still do sometimes but I'm pretty strong about it.

One thing I have to say is that you should not feel guilty. I used to feel guilty for so many reasons but ""breaking Judaism"" shouldn't outweigh the importance of you being you. Get up there and do your thing.

And you didn't lose your identity, you called Judaism your core but it's not. Maybe you thought it was but something showed you that at your core, is you, it's always been you and judaism was a nice addition to you... Until it wasn't. The important thing to understand isn't that you lost something. It's that you found something greater eventhough the people around you don't see it."

AskReddit,fgrveyh,t3_f06c8q,1581059036.0,"Best I got for you is, at the end of the day it comes down to control. Worrying about things to be a certain way. Sometimes it's better to understand that in some situations, you're just a passenger going for a ride and if that's the case, even with all the shit that's going on, you deserve to be happy.

Worrying can be good but only when you're in control, when you can make a difference. Otherwise, just let it go. All responsibilities you have are the ones you can achieve.

Hope this helps."

exjew,fghgde8,t1_fgh5z06,1580784212.0,"I have a religious friend who asked ME (without even knowing how religious I am) if I wanna pick up Wendy's. I was shocked but like I don't care and now I got a friend I can do more things with. 

Oh, he's married, goes to shul very often, wife wears a wig, learns on his free time. But wanted to pick up Wendy's with me...

At this point I'm dying to have this guy figured out. Like do you actually believe in God, what's your deal dude?

Fast forward a few weeks later, we had a shabbat meal with a few college friends (some jews, some non-jews). This guy gets up and gives a full blown dvar torah. Like I get why dvar torahs are uncomfortable, just isn't truthful imo and I would hate giving one. But this guy man, like he was so serious about it. All I was thinking about is how he was chomping on a cheeseburger and fries. Still unsolved till this day"
exjew,fghfpin,t3_eyh3hi,1580783791.0,"27 M and still putting on the religious front, less than I used to (naturally, being that I'm a bit older). So I remember when I was living at home and did the whole sneaking around business and was fine with it. The difference between you and I is when I left, it was for four years (went away for school) so I definitely had mee freedom. 

When I moved back locally, being the loving, caring, overwhelming (lol) parents they are, they really wanted me to move back in. I mean I had a ton of reasons not to but one big one was exactly this. I had my freedom and I really didn't wanna give it up.

If I were you, I'd look for every reason to not be home for shabbat. Go to a friend. Make plans with others and travel somewhere. Little white lies like telling your parents you're going to a friend for shabbat but end up in New Orleans won't hurt. It sucks you'll have to lie but I'll never tell my parents the things I'm okay doing until I see that they'll take that information well.

It's being the bigger person, taking that sacrafice, the burden. I'm sure your parents are good to you, that's why you wanna be good back. I don't know how open-minded they are but protecting them isn't necessarily the worst thing. If you think they'll be more accepting, being more open about it is a possibility."

Wellthatsucks,ffyo0gb,t1_ffydcoq,1580350973.0,"Age is also a factor. After a certain point, you can deduce things are stable and considering how invasive it is, may be better to not treat. The optimal age to get em out is 17-21. Roots of the teeth aren't very developed so easy to get em out  and patient is younger so healing is awesome. I don't know how old you are but in cases like this it does make sense to treat when symptomatic.

That being said (and this goes for everyone lol), that does not mean you only need tx when you re in pain. Dentistry revolves around preventative measures. We do fillings before you feel them because we are 100 percent sure it's only a matter of time it will hurt you physically and financially. We're not all after your money."
Wellthatsucks,ffynf5y,t1_ffyicww,1580350569.0,Dental Resident here. Not all wisdom teeth erupt in the same orientation as you can see from OP's x-rays. Pericornitis usually happens when the tooth has partial soft tissue coverage and stuff like food and/or bacteria get trapped in there causing an infection. If there's partial coverage that likely means the tooth was in a decent orientation to erupt to that point; I imagine it was relatively easy compared to this case.

If she has closed minded views, he should've at least known what he was getting himself into. They don't ever necessarily need to have the conversation dictating their sexuality, but I'm sure they spoke of those views sometime along a conversation, and you being bi, you better at least try to understand what kind of person she is if you're gonna marry her.

He got back with his ex. Maybe there were feeling for him throughout the marriage which helped him be comfortable to leave?

Honestly the lists of arguments against her being the bad one goes on and on. Goal is to  keep an open mind and see what her situation really is and keep it movin."
