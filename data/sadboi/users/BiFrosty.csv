BipolarReddit,fp00njv,t1_fozqa3l,1588200275.0,"This. So much this.

But I would also add that while I get less sleep while hypomanic (and end up functioning fine the next day), when I'm depressed my sleep cycle is also disturbed, but not quite in the same way.

When I'm depressed, I typically have a difficult time _getting_ to sleep, usually from ruminating on my current stressors. Once I fall asleep, I sleep undisturbed (typically) for anywhere from 12 to 14 or more hours, depending on the severity of the episode.

Like OP said, even if I get those 14 hours of sleep, I will feel so tired, foggy, and out of it all day. Cognitively, I function worse. It really sucks."
BipolarReddit,fon2jvk,t3_g8dsz4,1587910734.0,"I don't want to come off as too rude, but this was remarkably irresponsible and dangerous. You should never take a psychiatric medication without being under the care of a doctor, especially if you then proceed to mix alcohol with it. Alcohol amplifies the effects of seroquel.

I honestly can't believe you did this.

A few other thing is, 12.5mg is an entirely sub-therapeutic dosage. The only thing it will do at this dosage is cause sedation. I'm on 300mg. It took me a while to titrate up, as it does have a very sedative effect. This effect usually  lessens as your body adjusts and begins tolerating this medicine. You feel less and less drowsy, unless the medication will not work for you, at which point you can switch to a different medication, as is typical.

This whole post is a negative review of a popular antipsychotic medication that helps many individuals, myself included. Excuse me for saying bluntly, but you are in absolutely no way a reliable reviewer, as you do not have the chemical imbalance in your brain causing bipolar. You're reviewing a medicine for a disorder you do not even have. I'm sure if I took some chemo medication, I might have a bad opinion of it. But I would not post a review of those medicine while not having cancer, because that is just ludicrous. So is this."

mentalillness,fnsg7d8,t3_g3nadr,1587220939.0,"For me, routine helps me with my depression. Even if I can't make it to work that day, I still try to get out of bed at a decent time (no later than 9am), take a shower, and put on normal clothes. This usually elevates my mood quite a bit. If I can, I will try to exercise a little bit (crunches, pushups, some yoga / stretching, etc.).

But the thing that usually works the best for helping my mood on down days is to simply spend some time outside. Literally, going on a walk around my backyard, or sitting in a chair in the sun for 5 minutes do wonders for me.

None of these things will magically snap him out of his depression, but they should help to make the day itself go a bit easier.

Depression can be very hard to deal with, and I wish you both the best of luck!"
BipolarSOs,fnsf4ex,t3_g3fhll,1587220268.0,"I personally (diagnosed BP 2) appreciate it when my friends do what they can to remove the pressure from a situation. Especially when I'm in the middle of a depressive episode. My friends, when inviting me, will make it clear that it'd be great if I could participate, but no worries if I can't.

So simply being there, but without any real expectations of involvement for those days when I simply can't... that helps a lot. I find myself usually pushing myself to participate, even if I really feel like I'd rather lay down in bed, as long as I don't feel a pressure to participate. It's interesting."
BipolarReddit,fnseowg,t3_g3nmy2,1587219999.0,"I try not to get offended by comments like these. They most likely stem from a lack of understanding of what Bipolar truly is. I usually see it as an opportunity to teach the person about what Bipolar is, as opposed to getting upset.

I personally have made this mistake (based on ignorance) before I was diagnosed myself years later. The person to whom I was speaking was a psychologist in training, and immediately corrected me, explaining what it truly was. When she finished, I knew more about the disorder than I did before, so I see it as a generally net benefit.

All of this hinges on the assumption that the person making the comment isn't simply a tool (willfully continuing to use this analogy even after it has been explained), and has made a mistake rooted in ignorance."

I used to love playing video games, but now can find no joy in them past 5 minutes.

I usually fall back on watching nostalgic TV shows like The Office or The Simpsons, and just binge... but even that lately cant keep my attention.

So usually by the afternoon, I'm so tired and the fatigue starts to settle in that I find myself just falling to sleep for a few hours...

bipolar2,fl0po3w,t3_fllitu,1584712891.0,"Just a thought, I was put on Abilify a while ago, and I just finished tapering off of it due to how Agitated it made me.

The day after starting Abilify, I started having issues with wearing any clothes... they felt like they were laying wrong, so I was constantly fidgeting in them. I would eventually wear almost nothing most of the day because it was so uncomfortable.

Eventually, this worsened, to the point where I was so agitated that I couldnt sit in one position for more than a few minutes. It got so severe, I almost lost my mind.

I went to the psych to switch meds, and within a day of getting off of abilify, I started noticing a toning down of my symptoms.

Now, in your case, it easily could be the withdrawal from Klonopin giving you your symptoms, but I just wanted to also warn you of the side effects from Abilify, just in case it is also contributing. 

Hope you feel better soon!!"

AmItheAsshole,f7cimaq,t3_dv9ogm,1573593061.0,"My God you are so NTA. I am at a complete loss as to why everyone here is so absolutely triggered with thinking it was such an harmful thing that you deigned to ask a close relative to consider  being a surrogate.

I personally think it would be an honor to be considered as an option for surrogacy from a close relative. That does *not* mean that the person asked has to do it, at all.

I feel that, if the conversation was respectful, contained no guilting or manipulative language, and was simply inquiring into the possibility... why would you be the asshole for simply _asking_.

Everyone seems to be so stuck up on her being a vocal anti child person... again, because the specific circumstances of her anti-child rhetoric may not be known the relatives (does she not want to _raise_ children, does she not want to _birth_ children, etc.), so they shouldnt rule out a possibility of something so large without even asking the question.

Another thing people are _calling out_ is the sister now being a ""subject of discussion"" because of her reaction. Honestly, the subject of discussing her sister's response seems solely related to their surprise over her being unreasonably upset at being asked something.

To recap:

- I do not believe it was a rude thing to ask the sister if she was open to being a surrogate.

- I believe the sister was under no obligation to be their surrogate if she does not have any interest in it.

- I do not believe being surprised by their sister's reaction, and discussing it among people who are either directly involved (due to the sister telling her mom), or people who are close enough that they generally speak with them for general advice (the other mother) is to be expected.

Overall, I think the only person who stepped outside the bounds of natural interactions between caring people was the sister's utter overreaction to simply being asked something that she may not want to do.

NTA. Sis is a big A, not for not being a surrogate, but for responding to a question in such a bad way."

I can't stand people who believe Bi people somehow have it easier. The same camoflauge that they talk about making things easier can even cause bi folks to doubt themselves, even after coming to terms with their bisexuality in the first place.
