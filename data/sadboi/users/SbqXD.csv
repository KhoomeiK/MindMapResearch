I don't have a good history of being able to say goodbye or whatnot to people especially in the healthcare field and we were supposed to have our last sessions this April.

I laughed after she first called to cancel the appts. She said it's not right of us to not be able to have proper closure but hey I'm used to it I thought.
I figured that was it, I thanked her and said I understand and am okay on my own atm. 
I wasn't but what else could she do at the time?

Well she surprised me and called me twice 1-2 week after to follow up on future hopeful appointments and to actually check on me. I immediately didn't want to stress her out because everyone's going through a rough time- so told her ive been taking it day by day and there's no worry. But second time around... she asked me what's my week been and questioned me further- sly person! I ended up talking without realizing it. Haha. That was very amusing for me in a sense that wow. I've never had someone just check on me like that- or push past what most people just trust my word for. It was nice.

TalkTherapy,fl6brm6,t1_fl50k3c,1584861820.0,"This should be its own question- i like this question!
I don't think its unethical given there's safe guards for the therapist to protect and allow them to be able to handle whatever emotion clients may 'inflict'.

This can apply to many other jobs. For another health care one- it's like how we pay neonatal physicians to work with babies who may not always survive. The pain this kind of work can have on a person can be great but we can't/shouldn't live in a world where we hide from pain when we know of ways we can help. There is at the very least, strong educational backing and compensation for the work that's done.

Id then question is how well is the compensation for the job/task at hand. Do the compensations and education required for said job enough to make it ethically sound? 


My simple thoughts atleast."

Whoops, I already opened and used the product inside. My supposedly new laptop. 

Turns out both parties ordered the same one except mine had a touch pen. So I went to return it to the original owner as the good Samaritan would do.

Open finally getting to the correct address and the staircase leading to the door- I failed to notice the black Ice.

I don't really know how to trust myself fully. Although, I know this trust thing is very layered with struggling to filter my thoughts to ones that are ""non destructive"". 

I think it comes in time with exposure to all forms of trust. For me, trust can get easier to manage when I slowly start finding more and more people with whom I can also trust- atleast more so than before... For me this poses a risk, because Im tired of loss. But, when I met more people, I also started reconditioning my brain to trust some aspects of myself better-

 ex// I trust my choice of who I want to surround myself with. Theres all kinds of trust, from 'silly' to not; Ex2// trust in sense of style or taste to trust in a system to trust in your self in what your moral compass is etc.

The little things build to large, I know I got a long ways to go, but if I can figure out bit by bit what trust means to me in all shapes and forms I think I'll be fine.
