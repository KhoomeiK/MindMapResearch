intj,fr4k6n9,t3_gmd8qq,1589890507.0,"The self-help landscape can be quite difficult to navigate, but self-help saved me. Rather, there were books and videos that enabled me to change my ways and I cannot deny that. 

However, what is important is to have a mind of your own and I cannot stress enough how important that is. The modern self-help culture starts with the fact that something is wrong with you, and we readily believe that. But that's not always the case. 

My so-called self-help journey started when I left my last relationship and it was a new low for me. After a bunch of meaningless TED Talks and relationship advice, I came across this book called Rational Male by Rollo Tomassi. After the first couple of chapters, I realized that it was not for me. I understood what this guy had to say, but *it wasn't for me*. There were ideas I disagreed with.

Then, a friend told me about Models by Mark Manson and realized that it was more aligned with the changes I wanted to make in my life. Now, that book has a lot of things, but after reading the book, the only thing I did was actively invest more time in my hobbies and not be needy.

Another book I read was 12 Rules for Life by Dr Jordan Peterson. I read that book slowly, took breaks between chapters. Despite the intricate metaphors and stories, the main mantra is quite simple. The first chapter talks about standing up straight. There is literally an entire chapter explaining that. Well, I realized that to fix my posture, I needed to work out. So I started. Did that almost every day and now, after a year, I have lost nearly 20 kilograms. My posture is obviously better now. 

A couple more books that helped me is Atomic Habits by James Clear and The School of Life by Alain de Botton. I am particularly attracted to Soictism and have read Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. With the help of my aunt, who's a clinical psychologist, I also read CBT and that was helpful too.

On YouTube, I do like watching videos my Matt D'Avella and Nathaniel Drew. And these have contributed in some ways in my life. Also, I agree with what James say in this video. Eating healthy and working out is quite crucial, especially in these days when work life has become so cerebral and sedentary. 

But yes, I DO NOT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING I SEE OR READ. I am me, and there will be problems that are unique to my existence and there are no books to help me with that. 

P.S. Mr Robot is my favourite TV show and I like it that the video has clips of it."

Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted.

india,flgww8t,t3_fo661m,1585151871.0," Yesterday, I commented on this thread that I am having to go to the hospital during this lockdown on weekdays. My friend (from Nodia, WB) is presently living with us (Kolkata, WB) for her Stage 3 cancer treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital, New Town, Kolkata. Her radiation will be going on for 28 days, Monday to Friday.

We have hired a car. We carry papers and ID (including patient ID) and even have a signboard on the car saying that it's going to the hospital. Today, while we were inside the hospital, our driver was beaten up by the cops at the parking lot, just in the same way you guys are seeing in the videos that are being shared online. He stated the reason why he was there. The cops did not contact us or anything, he was simply beaten up.

This is anarchy.

I am not on social media other than Reddit and I do not intend to be because of how unreasonable people are in general. However, I would like to inform you all that certain cops are beating up people, whether they have a reason to or not. They are not communicating at all. We are trying our best to find out which police personnel exactly did this and take the relevant legal steps after the lockdown is lifted. I do not think that the police have orders to beat up anyone they wish to.

I would also like you all to warn others. And if you or any person you know is presently deployed to police the roads during the lockdown, kindly let us know what rules/instructions you have. Because today, it seemed like you have none."

I've been accompanying her to the hospital and back, have our own hired car.   
I hope this doesn't become an issue."
mentalhealth,flabroj,t3_fnk22w,1584980731.0,"Loneliness is loneliness. And to be honest, there are many facets of life from which loneliness can emerge. It can be from not being able to communicate with your peers or friends, it can be from missing a romantic partner, or even a pet. With the pandemic in place, a lot of people are actually feeling lonely. And different people have different ways of coping with that.

Forget about what others think. At least you understand that you are lonely and you're trying to cope up with that. You understand in what ways you are broken and that's a good start. Maybe, slowly, you can ask yourself why you feel this way. It's difficult, but you can give it a shot. Have a long and hard look inwards, try to talk to yourself like you'd talk to a friend. 

Where do you think this loneliness comes from? Why do you think that you feel a sense of rejection from people? Does hooking up give you some sense of fulfilment or does it simply allow you to put aside your thoughts of loneliness?"

But then again, i think this has more to do with how you grew up, the current social and political situation from where you are, the kind of media you consume and so on than it has got to do with being an INTJ."
intj,fl7wsb6,t3_fn2g88,1584911045.0,"I think a lot of that depends on your childhood and how you've matured over the years. I've always been a bit too needy, too invested emotionally, too selfless and often, my emotion would be all over the place. But lately, I've been more matured, I'm starting to realize who's worth my time and who's not. My need for space has been persistent though, no matter what."
intj,fl7ogbs,t1_fl7m58v,1584905989.0,"Thank you so so much for sharing this with me. This does resonate a lot with me. Because of the outbreak, my research schedule has been hampered a lot and nothing bothers me more than a botched plan. 

I understand that a lot of us say that we feel depressed, but after being ""clinically depressed"" for a while, I feel that this is different. I understand that things will run its course and that we do not have control over a lot of things. But I hope that this persistent heavy overwhelming feeling slowly subsides."

introvert,fkwqz3u,t3_fkxnbe,1584602097.0,"I just posted about this a couple of days back. Introversion and isolation are different things. You are feeling isolated and hence craving human contact. Try talking to friends and family (if possible) even though you may not make meaningful connections. Just talk, communicate. It may help. And if you don't find anyone, you cam talk to me."
