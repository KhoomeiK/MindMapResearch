TooAfraidToAsk,fo0rzra,t1_fo0poqu,1587418677.0,"Not wildly, at all. Are you a man? You’ve got to be a man. Of course there is variation, but this variation is limited by biology. Look at a diagram of a vulva. There can be variation in shape and size, but there is usually only ever slight variation in terms of placement. Like a human face, and the human body in general. 

And actually it is true, and can often be the case. Not saying always, but it’s happened before many times. As with the myriad of complications that can come with this type of surgery. Necrosis is a good example.

That’s irrelevant though, because I’m talking about sensation, which differs. The penis head is not as sensitive as the clitoris. 

Whilst it’s true that some vaginas don’t lubricate adequately, this is simply not the case for most (provided that a woman is properly aroused). That’s why it’s regarded as an issue. Neovaginas just can’t self-lubricate like an actual vagina can, because they are not like actual vaginas. Vaginal dryness in women warrants a trip to the gyne, because it’s uncomfortable

Again, there’s a difference between anatomically correct, natural variation, and a neovulva that doesn’t look like a vulva lmao

I mean, ‘cis vaginas’ don’t smell like intestinal fluid or shit. If they smell a certain way, i.e fish or metallic, this is usually indicative of a problem like BV or a yeast infection. 

You mean incels like the ones at r/transmaxxing ??"
TooAfraidToAsk,fo0npnl,t1_fo0hv30,1587416417.0,"Neovaginas are never anatomically correct (I mean both the vagina itself and vulva). Google SRS surgery results, and you’ll see. Even the best looking ones are clearly not vaginas/vulvas. They require long-term dilation, because they are wounds and would otherwise heal and close up. They are not self-cleaning like actual vaginas, and are thus more susceptible to UTIs. They are often too shallow for penetrative sex, and there is usually loss of sensation. No internal parts of the clitoris, no mucosal walls, no ruggae. The ‘clit’ is usually created from a small part of the penis head, so it won’t even be as sensitive as that was. And a penis head isn’t even as sensitive as a clitoris. Often they are hairy inside, too. You’re right about lack of lubrication, however those that are self-lubricating do so by being connected to the sigmoid colon, and lubricate with intestinal fluid. It doesn’t sit in the same place between the legs as the female genitalia. The lips don’t look the same. Inner labia sometimes just isn’t there. Doesn’t smell the same. Reaction to stimulation obviously isn’t the same.

I’m gonna add that—

The clitoris, clitoral glans, and hood take on an unusual appearance, with the clitoral hood specifically appearing to be absent. There is an actual hood, a foreskin, on a woman's clitoris, unless she has been subject to FGM.

Then there is the total lack of a cervix. While some women may not have a cervix due to partial or full hysterectomies, this isn't all that common in younger women.

Many Mtf SRS also use tissue from the anal canal to create vaginal tissue, particularly if the penis shrank too much to create appreciable depth. This has a smell.

Then inside  the neovagina there is the possibility for accumulation of gunk, for lack of a better word, because of the aforementioned fact that it has no way to self clean."

Maybe try complimenting her on things that are not her appearance, and ask her if she has any foods that she feels okay eating (‘safe foods’). You can try to encourage her to eat these. Looking into harm reduction tips can also be very beneficial, since bulimia can be damaging.

Paid surrogacy can lead to exploitation of poor or desperate women. India and Thailand used to be places where you could pay for a poor woman to gestate a child for you but the practise is now banned. Ukraine is the new destination.

Interesting reads here:

https://www.pri.org/stories/2011-03-18/underworld-upending-asian-baby-farm

""Most agreed to become surrogates, police said, though some were tricked."" When demand for women's wombs outpaces supply - what happens?

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/features/ukraine-baby-factories-human-cost-surrogacy-180912201251153.html

From that article: ""We were treated like cattle and mocked by doctors,"" Alina said. ""There was no hot water, we washed with plastic bottles over the toilet with water that was preheated in a kettle"" 

Questions to consider: should having children be commodified? Poor infertile women cannot afford to buy a surrogate, only rich infertile women/men can. As only rich people (comparatively) can afford this, and it's only poor women who do this, aren't their questions to be asked about exploiting poor women? Should it be ok to extract reproductive labor from poorer countries when we know it comes with long lasting health implications?

I personally have no problems with someone carrying a baby for a close friend/family member with no payment involved. This is often called altruistic surrogacy. But here is an article critical of altruistic surrogacy because I understand this can be exploited as well https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/25/surrogacy-sweden-ban
