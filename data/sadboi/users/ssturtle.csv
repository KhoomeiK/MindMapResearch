LoveNikki,fm3jnxh,t3_frd030,1585725875.0,"It's mentally exhausting getting all these collabs on top of everything else...I finally reached like 1K dias after the hell event, which was satisfying to see....and I'm sure if I keep saving it will be fine, but I don't want to play this game as much as I used to.

I just log into my association regularly to do the quota so I don't get kicked out (since I like them) and maybe collect some daily diamonds and then I'm out. 

But I'm honestly thinking of just quitting. They're not listening to us, I'm mentally exhausted by how few things there are to do in ratio to their recharges, and there's literally nothing to do most of the time. 

It sucks because I remember playing one of their early prequel dress up games and then starting this one...but I'm so bored. Everything is locked up behind a paywall and games like this have nothing to do. All you do is pay money and then what? I've lived that life and it was even more boring. This game was so important for me during one of the darkest periods of my life because it gave me a brief feeling of accomplishment to be able to do the daily duties so I'd really like to stick with it, but it's been eye opening recently how poorly we are treated compared to every other sever, despite how much more money we make them. 

Can we just get some of the outdated old events and let everyone rest?

Edit: don't get me wrong. I love love love this mucha collab. I love it so much more than the previous one because of the bright flowers and nice yellow gold dress. But it's still awful scheduling and I am mentally overwhelmed by all the different recharge this, recharge that. 

I've just got so much I'm dealing with right now that I've had to take a break from Nikki behind the bare minimum. I don't want to hear anyone going ""nobody's forcing you"". I have been a loyal fan for the longest fucking time and what they're doing right now is stupid .

Look, if you keep hyping up every event over (which is what collabs do) and you keep doing it over and over, your audience will get exhausted by it. This is obvious. That's why you need to give them a break and let them relax more. Introduce a ton of returning craft suits, give us some of the older dream weavers, a low key outdated event so they can resolve their clear scheduling issue with the new vs old graphics. That kind of stuff. Let us rest!"

HelixWaltz,flwalcd,t1_flw49c1,1585544338.0,"Your rant is wonderful and I was smiling the entire time. I feel like what you have to say is so interesting. Actually, on the matter of Queens of Henry not having power....Catherine of Aragon actually ruled as regent while he was away at war. 

From Wikipedia: 

On 11 June 1513, Henry appointed Catherine Regent in England with the titles ""Governor of the Realm and Captain General,"" while he went to France on a military campaign.[38] When Louis d'Orléans, Duke of Longueville, was captured at Thérouanne, Henry sent him to stay in Catherine's household. She wrote to Wolsey that she and her council would prefer the Duke to stay in the Tower of London as the Scots were ""so busy as they now be"" and she added her prayers for ""God to sende us as good lukke against the Scotts, as the King hath ther.""[39] The war with Scotland occupied her subjects, and she was ""horrible busy with making standards, banners, and badges"" at Richmond Palace. The Scots invaded and on 3 September 1513, she ordered Thomas Lovell to raise an army in the midland counties.[40]

Catherine rode north in full armour to address the troops, despite being heavily pregnant at the time. Her fine speech was reported to the historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera in Valladolid within a fortnight.[41] Although an Italian newsletter said she was 100 miles (160 km) north of London when news of the victory at Battle of Flodden Field reached her, she was near Buckingham.[42] From Woburn Abbey she sent a letter to Henry along with a piece of the bloodied coat of King James IV of Scotland, who died in the battle, for Henry to use as a banner at the siege of Tournai.[43]

Catherine's religious dedication increased as she became older, as did her interest in academics. She continued to broaden her knowledge and provide training for her daughter, Mary. Education among women became fashionable, partly because of Catherine's influence, and she donated large sums of money to several colleges.""

This, I feels, downplays how badass Catherine of Aragon was. She was queenly, noble, and full of dignity. She knew how to be a queen. Henry could not have asked for a better queen and what did he do? He threw her away. 

Sons to secure the dynasty. 

-

Mary would've made a splendid queen had her mother been allowed to continue to raise her. Isabella of Castile was her grandmother. 

(I do believe part of her vile rep was because Elizabeth wanted to draw clear contrast between them to make her rule out to be some golden age, but don't quote me on that.) 

All it required was that Henry control himself. If the young lady flees you regularly, then the answer is no. 

-

Anne was very into education as well. When the monastaries got broken up, she wanted to use the money for the people....but it ended up in certain people's pockets instead. She had scholarships that educated a good amount of Edward's tutor's. She was quite the Reformist. 

The Wikipedia article mostly focuses on how beautiful, graceful, fashionable, and intelligent she is and blah blah blah yes she was the perfect courtier. She was lavish when he was queen. She was also too intelligent and politically sharp for him to accept as queen. She helped solidify the alliance with France. But she did a lot more than that in her short time as queen. She was quite the activist. 

The church of England idea was very likely influenced by a book she lent Henry. So we see Protestantism vs Catholicism going on. 

""Beyond this, we also see that Anne was a believer in The Bible being published in the vernacular. At this point, Bibles were only available in Latin — and indeed English copies of the Bible were illegal. Many Protestants believed that The Bible should be accessible to lay people, thus creating a direct relationship between man and God through God’s word and divine revelation. It appears that in the final months of her life, Anne had an English copy of the Bible in display in her suite, and encouraged her attendants to read it [2]""

And she had no trouble openly challenging her husband. A lot of people (myself included - although I find her predecessor to be a fucking amazing woman as well, like damn) like her because she's the epitome of a modern woman in some ways and that's just so fascinating. 

It was awful what happened to her and the general idea was that Henry did it to make room for another wife. Even those that didn't know if the matter felt that the what he treated her disgraceful. Nobody wanted to be Henry's new wife lol.

He had an incredibly vile reputation, like Bluebeard. 

""Of I had two heads, I would gladly give him one,” Christina of Denmark (a great beauty of her day) is said to have said this to an ambassador who proposed marriage. 


-

When Jane tried to speak out on a matter (national pardons for pilgrims of pilgrimages) to Henry later on, he reminded her of what happened to Anne. Jane was very careful not to arouse his ire. She was more strict and formal, more reserved, but I don't think she was as stupid or simple as people like to portray her. She appeared to have more Catholic sympathies, if you get my drift. 

Anne of Cleves is said to have pushed him away and sworn at him in German when this incredibly drunk fat man came to ""surprise"" his bride. Henry did not take the rejection well. 

 She was also a very smart woman who got to live a life of luxury and relative freedom instead of being sent back to Cleves where she would not have been treated (and wasn't) nearly as well. 

Henry liked intelligent women, women with something special about them. He just couldn't stand what that meant long term. It's like his ego kept getting in the way. I think it may be partly due to the insecurity of the Tudor dynasty at first, but mostly him. He exhibited this behavior long before the joust that is said to have changed his behavior. All it did was make him fat. I'm not as interested in Henry as I am the women who surrounded him, my bad. 

Had he not been king, he might have been a better person."

It's true the company seem a bit green or just not very put together sometimes, but they do earnestly put their effort in. They have to pay the artists too. I think they must commission artists for each suit, considering the cost."
HelixWaltz,flrdepf,t1_flqvoyu,1585417945.0,"I think you've got some good points because you're just really solid over all in the way you analyze things. I've been playing since beta, but took a break and saw all these beautiful suits during events that has occurred. I regretted, of course, but that's normal. They do a good job of making you regret. 

The issue is that they don't come back the same way. They come back as eggs and that's incredibly unfair for players that missed it. I was gutted by how they handled the tea party return. 

I think there are a lot of mini events but rare actual big events or if they are, they're overly complex and this just exhausts the players. I think players leave because of that, the way return events are handled, find the story uninteresting, or are bored for too long about how slow a lot of events are. I'm through nearly all of the story and it can be dull. Especially if I came for the European dress up but got a lot of eccentric fantasy suits instead. I don't mind eccentrism but there's a lot of recurring designs over and over again that can bore a person. 


This is a game that you kind of play as a side game (it's my current obsession though). There's so much things to do but the game itself is rather clunky and they've been considerably less...I guess, it's been too challenging and less fun for the players. Like you're playing a game of chess with them and that's kind of unfair, considering their own position as a game that is not fully well established yet. There's also the matter of one's phone data. This is a clunky game. So I would say that there are a lot of valid reasons.

Somebody on the LN forum even asked me recently ""I finally got enough space for Helix Waltz, but is it worth it? I hear it gets challenging and too difficult to accumulate suits""

So HW already has this kind of rep and it's scaring off potential players. 

Considering that the storyline is fairly light, how slow it can be sometimes (requires patience), and that this is a dress up game....I hope that it will become more balanced in the future."

AsianParentStories,flpwd8u,t1_flozp9c,1585370754.0,"This. You were probably her only insurance policy (as awful as that sounds) and the only way to continue the family line. A lot of our parents are traditional. They went to a new place and clung to their culture, or maybe it just came out. The places they moved from changed towards the future, but they're kind of still in a time capsule in ways of Asian culture. It's hard on a person and the Asian countries aren't exactly known for being aware of mental issues, if at all. They don't understand mental health. Even those like my family, who've been impacted by deaths because of it, had trouble getting it when it came to raising me. 

If the issues (her being cared for, the family line) were resolved, I wonder if she might actually calm down? It sounds like she's freaking out right now and has no idea to handle it. She thinks she can get you to stop, but once she realizes she can't...this situation will either be over or a small hill towards acceptance will be crossed. 

I don't think she's going to disown you, but I also don't know your family situation. 

Maybe freeze spern and putting that aside for the future may be of help. Then she can have her grandkids to carry on the family line. She'll probably have to deal with humiliation with all her Asian friends and them gossipping behind her back, but it's been known to happen even with hetero couples. I saw it in a drama once. It seems they were trying to raise awareness in a way. 

If her friends are awful about this then that just means she knows who her real friends are. 

But you've got your own life too, you know. This is your identity here. Your gender. So while I hope for your sake that things get better for you, you also must make your own decision. 

I can't imagine how difficult it would be to transition and you're so brave for coming out to her. 

My parents didn't acknowledge my bisexualness (I think I might be more pan, I don't know, I just love when I love lol) and I felt that this was a sign of their love, since they're willing to look the other way. But over time they've come to accept it and that maybe they weren't the best parents to me over the years. My mom actually said to me recently ""I abused you and I'm sorry. I feel so bad about it. I'm a terrible mother."" And yeah that happened. I'm not sure how but it did. 

She's been reflecting a lot as of late. 

My mom is like your mom. Controlling and overbearing and always using those kinds of methods. Now she's like...I don't even know who she is. She's like so nice to me now. I'm terrified half the time. Like who are you?

We women of the modern age do not look kindly upon this man. I'm a fan of Anne Boleyn (sometimes I wonder how she might have lived in this modern age - probably some high powered office lady), but I think Catherine of Aragon was an absolute power queen. A real badass. 

Mary would've done a good job as a queen had she had her mother by her side (and not been fucking traumatized by her dad abusing her - the abuse worsened after Anne died. That's probably when Mary realized that Anne either tried to protect her (records indicate she was a good hearted woman - all the women sent to wait on her in the tower of London fucking hated her guts because I think they were supported of Mary but they were sobbing by the time she was to be executed) or stay out of it. 

I did not know that about the ancient Greeks but that's so pathetic I don't even know what to say. I'm sympathetic though. It goes to show how often they were away at war, that they're not even used to the company of women and don't know how to deal with it. Ancient Greece was mostly a bunch of city states so rights of women varied. Spartan women (badasses) had more rights than Athenian women (who barely had any rights at all). It's hard to say. 

I think they were traditional at best, but it's hard to compare their culture to today's sometimes. They romanticized ""the Amazons"" often. Their myths were often metaphors, some of which for things we may not ever fully know (due to the secrecy of cults of worship). 

I think the hysteria over lesbians was from this one writer. Was it Sophocles? He is a well known ancient Greek writer  I don't remember anymore but I remember being amused by he hysteric way he describe lesbians. Sinful rubbing or something of the like. 

Because if women all became lesbians, there's nothing left for the men. And I'm sure there's reproductive right mixed in too. Maybe he was dumped for a girl. 

But sometimes I look at the misogyny of ancient Greece and I'm like...there's not much difference from today sometimes. It's a little like looking at translations of ancient Roman graffiti. The hysteria of old guys, laid for us all to see. 

The thing is that we don't have enough records left so we can only count on the opinions of a few men. Even the ancient Roman emperors...I'm fairly certain they were not all despots and it's just senators saying it to justify murdering nearly all of them. The way poor Aurelius was murdered is probably the few transparent ones. They felt bad about murdering him due to what accounted for an error in the records office (some guy messed up, feared for his life because Aurelius was a military man who strictly cracked down on corruption, and then set up a plot for rebellion). So they deified him. 

Even Nero. Actually, Nero wanted to be close to the people. His building projects were for that purpose.  He was very popular with the people and they mourned him greatly. My guess is that he was in a gilded cage and wanted to be where the people were. Poor Nero. He actually wasn't that bad. When Rome was on fire, he wasn't fiddling. He was sending aid. The fire had to be put out and shelter and supplies for he people. He came off a compassionate man. 

Caligula did not want to literally make a horse a senator. He just said it and they were like ""omg he's so crwzy"". It just sounds like a guy sick to death of arguing with senators all day. ""You're so incompetent a horse could do your job!"" Probably.

Nearly every emperor was very qualified and accomplished because they were colleagues of the previous emperor. It's like the CEO passing the seat to a handpicked successor. That's why there's a lot of adoptions and we very rarely see actual dynasties with them. 

But we can't doubt for a second that it's a very gilded cage. And that if we'd given them some time to actually do their jobs instead of sending them on to the Tiberius, Rome would've been a lot better for it. One Emperor was a military man, don't remember which, who was killed because he made his soldiers plant the vineyards and help the people whose places they pillaged. We still use those vineyards today. They're some of the finest. 

The convents sounded amazing. I did not know that fun fact. Thank you. It was actually some of the churches who stood against the Nazis the most. They were very much against this discrimination crap and showed solidarity with the Jewish people. Christianity gets a bad rep nowadays, but there's always people who will actually follow its precepts. There's always interfaith solidarity between the Abrahamic religions in the news, even in the modern day. 

""Love God.""
""Love one another as you love yourself.""

According to Christ, these were the two precepts that hung all the laws and the prophets. Which is to say, everything else is meant to prepare people to be able to love others like this.

I wonder sometimes what might have happened had they all been born in the modern age. I imagine Anne might have never married Henry lol. 

Or Heliogalbus. He married a Vestal Virgin (ancient Roman virgin priestesses of Hestia in charge of watching over Rome' great hearth flame - if it goes out somebody clearly had sex and would be charged with incest and then excited). He did that claiming they would have ""godly children"". He was forced to divorce her but they still lived together a few years later, for a number of years. 

He also had a lover named Hercules (chariot driver?) And he delighted in that man calling him wifey. The Romans didn't have anything against homosexuality (unless you were at the bottom, since it was a weirs dominance thing). But if course, there's records of ancient men still hysterically railing against lesbians. Typical. 

There was only one emperor that was like fully straight and everyone thought he was weird for it), but Heliogalbus had made a lot of awkward mistakes (really funny ones sometimes) and he was also from a different Roman territory ""oriental"" so you had that.

That said....I appreciated how we could learn to understand a little more of these extraordinary women and gain more appreciation for their clothing. They definitely did their research with the types (for the most part - Marie's outfit looked a little too made in China rip off). They also mentioned the necklace affair and corrected the let them eat cake quote. That put them in my good books. 

Marie was immature and had difficulty fitting in at the ridiculous and overly strict French court compared to the fairly lax Austrian one. There's a story of how she was left shivering wet and cold, naked for hours because the etiquette was too stiff. 

During that time, men could not sit. This is also because their pants were too tight. There were a lot of ridiculous rules that the thirteen(?) year old Marie had trouble following or getting used to. She was not good at books and some believe she had ADHD 

Her mom was not happy about this of course, but that's how Marie coped. She was unhappy and regularly tried to escape court life, which in turn made nobles unhappy because in their court, it was the right of nobles to always have access to their monarchs. It was the nobles who helped start the revolution in the first place. 

Anyways, she cleaned her act once she got older and had kids. She even adopted some. She tried to get closer to the people. That's where the scandalous chiffon dress picture came in. She was trying to show her vulnerable side but too little too late.

The way the heir to the throne (only seven years old) was abused, went catatonic from the trauma then died covered in feces was so heartbreaking. 

He was forced by his captors to bear testimony that his aunt and mother sexually abused him. Then they treated him this way until he died. It's a sad story of what happened to poor Marie. 

I heard that her father tried to stop the carriage before she left for France but was too late. The astrologers had said that her fate would not be good.

HelixWaltz,flnteby,t1_fl4j264,1585325517.0,"Mary Tudor was hot. When she was younger. She also loved children and always wanted a family. It was only that her father was an ass who refused to marry her off to somebody worthy of her for political and ""I'm always right"" reasons.

She deserved better, damn it. Elizabeth I had been my idol since childhood, but Mary deserved better. The older you get, the more you realized how awful a father Henry VIII was and how he fucked up all of his children. Elizabeth seemed traumatized from the marriages, Mary was treated horribly and just abused (as was Elizabeth), and Edward...eh. I don't know as much about him I'm afraid. 

Like Anne Boleyn left court because Henry kept harassing her. That's not an ambitious woman, that's a ""please leave me alone so I can make a good match without being seen as used goods"".

Jane Seymour seemed more ambitious in comparison. That woman was smart. I mean it's not good to be the third party in a marriage, but either her handlers or her were smart in how they got his attention. 

I was thinking about it today. How Henry VIII knew some amazingly extraordinary women but was unworthy of them.  He loved great women but couldn't accept that they were great, or something like that.

 And while I'm at it, on Catherine Howard possibly wasn't a virgin before. I wouldn't say she was promiscuous so much as a victim of sexual abuse, grooming, and predatory behavior when she was young. When you look at her age at that time, that's what it looks like. She was also possibly blackmailed about it by Culpeper. 

She was very kind to both Mary and Elizabeth, Catherine. There was a tiff with Mary, but that's normal considering their ages. Elizabeth was out of favor and there wasn't much connection save distant blood, but she still had her sit across from her at the head table. She came off genuinely kind but that may be due to my own bias. 

All of the wives of Henry had something extraordinary about them. If only he could've settled for one."

Can we do an entire event based around it? We can have her knight outfit, her old outfit, her wedding dress etc etc. 

 She's so badass at the end of first season that I really want to know what would cause her to give it all up for the sake of love. Like what did he do???? Serenade her every night? Show off his impressive cooking skills? 

All partners can be different versions of Zoe. 

And we can do Mom and old duke Bavlenka too....he was willing to get her an incredibly rare and expensive book from another kingdom just because she wanted it (because others wanted it). Why did they not marry?"

LoveNikki,flncvzx,t1_fln1sto,1585315709.0,"That is so sad! Me too! I think the closest is the darker Masquerade dress. I half heartedly sacrificed my diamonds when the suit recipes returned because I really do love big poofy dresses. I want to live my dream of being a princess in game even if I can't outside of it.

I am going to do the lifetime suit for those big poofy dresses and swan boat, but I dislike the overuse of crosses. There's more to historical clothing than using crosses.  

For Helix Waltz - I think you should try it to see for yourself. It may be a good distraction if nothing else and you can always delete it. If you set up an account with password, you can always return to it. They even have a feature for forgotten password. 

It's different from Love Nikki but it's easy to accumulate clothing in the beginning. It gets harder and more irritating over time (at least for me) but that's because I haven't had much interest in the recent tiny events. The big events have been more difficult to progress in as of late and there's an over reliance on the gacha type system called ""eggs"". 

There's actually a lot of fun concepts that I personally liked, like the materials eggs which will not only drop crafting materials but also parts of the material egg suit. Or that you can add special effects to make suits more beautiful, but...

It is, as you've heard, a lot of trouble to progress in later levels and it's harder to progress during certain game events as of late. 

The art can range from ugly to incredibly beautiful (the big poofy dresses are there) but it doesn't seem cheap for the company considering how they pass the costs down to us. 

I like it sometimes but other times it sucks. I would say it's worth it to check it out if you've the memory and see if you like it. While game mechanics are clunky and the game not very smooth at times, they do work to fix game mechanics issues fairly quickly. Their response time is faster. They just need to make events more easier and less over complex, like they did in the past."
LoveNikki,flmqiys,t1_flmotut,1585292527.0,"I do...I just like the big poofy European style dresses that we don't always see. 

I don't really like having to see the same variations on high low dresses all the time and I'm a bit sick of goth. Or if it just makes Nikki look like a cupcake, I can't do that one. I have to rely on Helix Waltz for my needs now, but that game is so...ugh. It's so hard to make progress in that game."
LoveNikki,flmlhfr,t3_fpg1c1,1585287326.0,"CocoPPa Dolls is the closest, though it's more cutsey. The suits are animated. They've got it together too. The only issue is that going through levels is sooo tedious as are game mechanics sometimes. It's not that different from LN in that way, but there's some places where LN is smoother (like the crafting and shops). 

However the brightly colored designs and animated suits are very cute. The English is a little hard to understand sometimes but mostly understandable. The premise and idea is very cute. They run events on the gacha so it is less complex, and it's easier to build up a cache. 

They're a fairly new game but very good."

exmormon,fl0uqzi,t1_fl0raks,1584716165.0,"I think BoM has some good principles in it even if I'm skeptical of it at times. I prefer Old Testament out of all the books. 

I also use it (BoM) for my argument for those who believe in it, so that they can take a pause and consider it from a different angle. It also acts as a common language sometimes. The matter of the Zoramites and them kicking all the poor people put of their clean temples, declaring them unworthy, is a good example. We all have long had lessons on how corrupt and bad it is since childhood and when you recognize it in the behavior of those around you, you may begin to reconsider. 

Edit: What you see now cannot be unseen. The way they teach in the church means the impression will immediately transfer onto this instance, I don't know of that makes sense, but they'll immediately recognize it as bad if they know where to look. I'm not sure if you get what I'm saying.

Because you're used to one view. Then you realize that the teachings of God still apply to you."
exmormon,fl0qvnn,t1_fl0by1c,1584713715.0,"There's room for scientific skepticism and overall skepticism, but not in my spirituality. Not in my own healing, but it's good that it helped you. Thank you. 

My spirituality takes a valuable place that cannot be replaced. Scientific skepticism cannot heal everything, especially not what happens when men claim priesthood trumps women and sexually traumatize one. Separate parties tried to force me on drugs to shut me up. They were hiding something and thought I revealed it or got too close to the truth. 

In my bitter experience, what a lot of people claim is logic or skepticism is often used to suit their own egos. There exists the principle of logic, of skepticism, and sciences, but it is not an all cure for my ills. Spiritually coming to a peace with myself and what I've had to face does. 

It is very hard to hear from the Lord ""you are right and they are all wrong"" while hearing his supposed saints say and do everything to fight for the opposite. They're willing to gaslight, manipulate, and hurt their way save for those in tune enough with the Lord (or themselves) to realize that there's something wrong going on here. They're willing to do that until you're unable to see right from left. 

It helps, I think to think of the examples of women who tried to buck off polygamy or refuse it or reveal it. They pray in solitude after being guilt tripped to hell and back, the Lord tells them they can say no. They can choose not to and it will not keep them from a good and right marriage should they choose it in the future. 

It helps to think of a God who will one day strike down vicious, abusive, and selfish men who attempt to use fake spirituality for their own lustful desires down. That's something that can help somebody who feels as if they've nothing to turn to. 

And seeing Moroni and his broken arm helps validate what I've experienced. 

Thanks for your kind words. Sorry I cannot fully accept them. Yet although I can't fully agree, I appreciate the gesture. Scientific skepticism is important for science. Spirituality for spirituality. Logic reigns above all, but you know, there's also emotional needs to consider for a woman in my position as well."

Once Moroni's arm was outstretched. Now it is gone! Now it looks like he's scolding the temple goers. There is nothing to broadcast with because Moroni has been silenced like many righteous people. 

This is clearly an omen! A sign!

exmormon,fl03loj,t3_fldw43,1584690116.0,"Mormon Jesus doesn't even say that. All he did was prioritize the poor and those who needed healing, those who needed help the most. 

Instead there's lots of chapters in BoM on pride cycle, lots of focus on the right way to treat the poor, and how the Zoramites are dicks for treating the poor this way. This meme draws such a contrast between the actions of members and the Lord they claim to follow. It's like nobody actually studies the scriptures on their own, just looks for others to interpret for them.

It's like the advent of the gutenberg printing press doesn't exist in their world. Why are you letting your pastors and peers interpret the scriptures and decide your own spirituality for you? Will anyone be able to get into heaven with that?"
exmormon,fl037ms,t3_fljl9t,1584689663.0,"God leaves signs for his followers. This pandemic will only be the beginning. The arm of Moroni is broken. 

Plus if families are that important to the Lord, then the government ripping them apart as many church members applaud on the sidelines (or othering refugees until commanded not to) isn't going to end well. The BoM is very clear on what happens to nations and churches like this. They're like the Zoramites at this point where they shut out the poor out of their shiny buildings, not realizing that God isn't there anymore. His spirit cannot or will not dwell in placed where all people do is self congratulate themselves for being special because they're Mormons. Chosen generation indeed! 

It's basically writing on the wall that you've just got to pay attention to. Isn't that outlined continually in the scriptures to begin with? At times of trouble, the Lord will warn his faithful followers or allow them to see it for themselves. However righteous and faithful people may still be hurt or killed by it and they aren't less righteous for it. 

You may not know the details (maybe some do), but don't you get it sometimes? This sense that the Lord is displeased at the actions of certain people in power and that something big is gonna happen (but it's not the end, yet. Not even close). Every person is capable of being a prophet in their own right in that respects. 

Doctrinally, we can receive revelation for ourselves and sometimes do the work of the Lord, where you do or say something that has no particular meaning to you but has a great deal of meaning for that person. Sometimes we can pay attention to whatever he sends ouf way, even if we feel very dense and dumb after we finally get it. It took me years to realize I should check to see what's causing my headache and that it isn't merely PTSD, but something greater at work (like spinal issues lol). 

You shouldn't be relying on the prophet for something you're supposed to do yourself. They're good for leadership and guidance as a whole, but there's the hireling and there's the master of the flock. 

God is not limited to buildings. He is God. He can go wherever he wants to go. I think the church is going down the wrong path with President Nelson (they kiss his ass in nearly every talk, it's unnatural), but I think if the Lord wills it, He will humble them and make his own displeasure known."

You just need to act and things will slowly streamline on their own. Our server has the most issue mobilizing and maintaining the flow, but if we get past that, then the rest will slowly organize itself by way of ease and priority. Sometimes it's the action that comes first.

A lot of these people paying for these outfits have to eat too, not all can afford it either. 

Honestly, if they wanted to pander to new players they'd give us all the dream weavers so that new players end up binge playing until they're hooked by the story. If they just gave it all to us, nobody would complain. Gameplay would be up and then they could run some nice recharge that catch people's eyes. Nikki Games already had an amazing game process. I don't know why Elex is making things harder for themselves except that they had no faith in an international market and so played to overwhelm for cash cow and then dump the game once the consequences of their actions catch up to them."

Helix Waltz is fun for binge playing too even if it may turn you off with its ugly outfits. Sometimes they've got truly good art though. 

Alive Closet is a Japanese game that can only be downloaded from this one app I forgot the name of (sorry) but it's only in JPN and the art is by the mangaka of Saint Jeanne and it's cute Lolita style. I wish I knew JPN because the story looks super interesting.

LoveNikki,fku7dih,t1_fku62u6,1584543816.0,"Isn't that equal treatment though? Every server but us got the extra diamonds (they were given to help us keep up with the more expensive events). That's why we are asking for it. 

Some aren't to the level of Dream Weaver yet, others are. How we choose to do this can give other servers more leverage so they don't end up like that unfortunate server that got shut down and barely got anything for it. They were really shafted. It just closed with little warning, if I remember correctly, and they got a handful of diamonds (200?) but no closet transfer. 

We are missing so many dream weavers that even one is not enough. They've given us nearly all of the paid ones but like, less than 10% of the free ones that should be out by now. Then there's a ton of old events that just happen to be cheaper that other servers got but we didn't. We don't expect to be a clone of other servers or vice versa, but we are far enough for it to become more and more clear that we have only been given a skeleton of a game. 

Tagging system is a related but not the same issue in my opinion since it asks for new features rather than ones already put in. A lot of the old events aren't hard to run and it's good for Elex too since they'll look outdated compared to the new stuff, thus bringing down earnings. Blood Moon, anyone? JPN had it long before we did and by the time it came to us, the excitement was limited to only a few posts here and there instead of the crowds of crazy fans that it used to be.

Did you know there were Dreamweaver events meant to come with this event? They were also free, that's why we aren't seeing it. 

 But Elex is not responding to us. They're just spending more cash paying people to go after anyone that badmouths them on the internet. People have been bullied out of this game and sub because of it. 

They're going to think it's ok to do worse than Frost Rose in the future if we just give in like this. That's what they did before and what happened? Frost Rose. Hold your cash. Wait and see. 

Who knows, you might even get a nice recharge suit out of it. Didn't Irie show some nice ones on Instagram? Some of them aren't that expensive either. You should wait it out.

LoveNikki,fku2uyn,t3_fkpexa,1584541028.0,"Don't listen to them. This is exactly what is needed. They haven't given a response and co-opted a ""gift giving"" meant to rise awareness of COVID for their own purposes. They're not that concerned if they're exploiting COVID awareness for their own agendas. 

You're not freaking out or overreacting. A lot of us feel the same way. I have watched for years as the game went from giving us all the features (albeit at a slower rate) to slowly witholding more and more while asking for more money with everybody making excuses for them. 

It's not polite, we should be more grateful, we need to have more appreciation for the providers of the game (FYI that's NOT ELEX), they're Chinese and we need to be understanding of their culture, etc etc and now COVID. You're a bad person if you criticize Elex. People have always made room for players with these ideas and beliefs and that's good, but a lot of the people on this end will bully people out of the game - long standing and new. Something the fandom universally agrees on will suddenly be downvoted or a light hearted joke taken too seriously and used to throw mud on somebody's character. 

This isn't normal fandom behavior. If it weren't for what's very likely a paid keyboard army, it would be very clear just how many players have actually stuck with this game (and aren't new). It's propaganda, plain and simple. 

COVID is a concern, but this isn't the first nor last time they've been despicable in business practice and I'm their inability to provide a proper gaming experience on behalf of another company. 

This is just another excuse and yet another tactic by a keyboard army. They've already got the codes for a lot of these things - there was a post that mentioned it. Nikki Games gave them the other parts already, they're just choosing not to do it. If they wanted to, we could see a bunch of it the next day. They're just choosing to screw us over with bad scheduling of expensive events after expensive event instead of catching us up properly. So they'll throw in incredibly outdated events when they can't do the expensive ones. 

FYI: Some of those free Dreamweavers were an ORIGINAL part of Steps of Sorrow aka THIS HELL EVENT. They had to have made the conscious decision to withold it from us. There's been cases like this where they do gymnastics to keep it form us. This isn't just bad for free players, it means paying players are paying more for less enjoyment - that should rightly be theirs.

Frost Rose was not the first nor last, but everyone is acting as if Elex is an Indie company when it's got worldwide offices...and when it's screwed up nearly every other game it's touched. It's a miracle Nikki had been able to survive this long. One day, the player themselves will finish helping Elex strangle her and I won't be surprised.

You know why CN server gets things done? They don't worry about the feelings of a large company or whose CEO makes more a year than most of them even make. They worry about their gaming experience and their money's worth.


YOU ARE RIGHT OP, don't let them try to undermine you. There's always been an odd and suspiciously vocal lot who will always undermine players who try to stick up for themselves (or who say anything that may be misconstrued as Anti Elex). They do it so you get used to a certain level of low level treatment while giving them the same amount of money. That's what abusers do. That I'm seeing people stick up for them regardless leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

This was what mine did and people defended them too. Love Nikki was partly what helped me get past it, but it's so unpleasant being here most of the time that I've got no choice but to slowly start planning for a permanent deletion. I've got other dress up games on my rotation.

CocoPPa Dolls, Alice Closet, and Helix Waltz. There's sites like Doll Divine, Azalea's Dolls, and even Rinmaru. They're not going to have the same emotional bonds as Nikki, but I'll only be enraged to death by Elex if I stay any longer.

Elex will not change and people will continue to be ripped off. They'll be outraged then they'll spend hundreds to thousands of cash on a game experience that's less than 60% of what they deserve. This game is partly engineered in a way similar to gambling. It's hard to quite once you're unable to stop spending. 

I know of several old players way back when who were forced to quite due to their addictive personalities. Boycott was what helped me stop. I have been boycotting since, in protestations of their terrible business decisions. 

You should share the link to their app stores on their FB and everywhere. Let people give their one star ratings so they know to stay away."

Not a lot of kudos on a story important to me, but now I'm aware that people are following it, maybe even looking forward to it. There may be people who follow your story whom you cannot see. For them, it may be the highlight of their entire week or something enjoyable during a stressful or painful time. 

The story is pretty slow right now so this is only telling me good things.

This means readership may be increasing. If I keep updating it and keep letting it accumulate hits or kudos, people will get curious over it and want to try to read it. Them they'll read through your other stories and you will get a rash of favorites and follows. Moderate success over a oneshot taught me this. It was light hearted trash and people started reading and following my other oneshot that they wanted a continuation of. It takes time to win over a fandom. Most writers quit before they can.

I am sorry to hear it! Such a ridiculous thing! 

That's something I've noticed - where the fandom almost universally agrees on something but random people on this sub will get bullied or picked on or whatever for it. It's like a combo of a keyboard army at work and the internet bad habit of jumping on bandwagon & going ""yeah, so you're a bad person which means moral ethics won't apply to my rude behavior towards you"" 

I won't deny it's satisfying to see at least a little pushback from our end. What I've seen hasn't been toxic, just a little annoyed at best, which is pretty normal I think. But it's one thing to get sarcastic or try to inform the other party, it's another to bully somebody for having a differing opinion.

 I think no matter the side, we should keep in mind that line that should never be crossed. We shouldn't be saying ""you're an awful person"" or picking on them just because they don't feel the same way. We may not understand and find it mind boggling logic, maybe even resent (since this resentment may have been slowly seething beneath he surface all this time), but...I dunno, it doesn't seem right to bully people off of games. If somebody buys Nimbus, I won't hate on them although I might be a bit disappointed inside. It's their money, their choice. 

Likewise, we can have our opinions and we can have our choices and our calls for a better game for the money we give. We can have our boycott too.

There's always been room for them, but maybe we should be working to make room for everyone. Not less room for them or anything, just more room for everybody."

LoveNikki,fkaeras,t1_fk7y91z,1584004693.0,"People have been bullied off the game before. There was one poster who was saying their customer service wasn't good and it was her first post. She was somebody in that field (the client service) as career too. She was saying how she felt that people were getting shafted by how Elex behaved. 

People downvoted her to hell and called her a Karen for stating the truth. They got kind of nasty. She got sick of it and left the game forever. I tried to help and yeah...I ended up leaving this sub until boycott drew me back. 

People always getting on their white horses and making others out to be the bad guy despite acting immaturely themselves...that annoys me. 

I'm being accused of speaking bad about others for pointing out a genuine concern I have about bullying? I'm accused of being in favor of treating service industry badly when I've worked in? Not as merely a summer job but as the beginnings of a career (then life happened and my trajectory changed). 

Like please get off your white horse and stop adding moral judgements when you don't even look at the other side. That person was a professional for many years in client service. She knew what it was like and so do I. It's not unrealistic for her to expect professionalism from somebody in her field. That's pretty normal if you've ever worked in service. People who have it as a career (or have been there for years and years) take it very seriously. They expect others to too. It's not just a throwaway. It's their livelihood. 

I noticed around that time that a lot of comments and posts pointing out what Elex were doing got downvoted and picked on. People kind of sweeeping it under the rug. Now we have this situation. Nobody can ignore that they've (Elex) been pushing and pushing the envelope way too much. 

There has always been a pro Elex contigent.

There is always always room for people who think we don't know what we are talking about. People make great pains for them. They always have space to get onto other people and bully them off subs or out of games. There's always been plenty of space for them, but not much for us. 

I think this boycott is actually a step in the right direction because now people can be open to speak. There's a validation for what a lot of us have noticed and always said. Now there's more unity as people put aside that division to address a legitimate grievances."

Yes those small clunky issues that I don't like. We haven't gotten our backgrounds from there either. They're all over the place and they wouldn't be if they'd just dump all the stuff they'd been holding back and focus on what's ahead of them. There's already a 3d Nikki. It's not like Nikki doesn't have a future for this global audience. 

I have never been into the notebook sticker thing, myself. Stickers take up space I could be using. 

I am horrified to hear that the French translation is better. Good for the French, upsetting for us English speakers. I'm not sure if they even have translators. Someone on this sub mentioned how they put the Chinese translation through Google and it came out the exact same. A translator made a recent post on this sub explaining that translating doesn't even take that long and it's not that expensive. Nikki isn't too difficult either. 

You nailed it on how we can be patient with small hiccups like this. We can be patient for a lot of things. What they don't realize is that a lot of players won't complain out loud. What they do is carefully take note of it in their hearts until it becomes a tsunami. It's a testament to what a good game Nikki is even at its bare bones that so many put up with this. 

I wouldn't be surprised if this pulled this either. They're notoriously awful at scheduling."
LoveNikki,fk2fowv,t1_fk2dxal,1583800024.0,"This is a global server too! You've got Eurozone and South America (I believe). Probably elsewhere since English is the international language. So you're absolutely right that they're missing out on a lot of people. So many keep leaving because they get bored. There just isn't much to do once you've caught up to the game beyond events and if you don't like the design, then tough luck! It's intimidating for new players to see these diamond expensive games and the average player will become fatigued from this money racketeering. 

You'd think they'd be smarter right? But I think what happened is that they kept things too close to the chest. They wanted to make sure that they could always keep the events flowing. They wanted to always have something new. The problem is that CN is doing very well and releasing suits that make the old ones look outdated. We went from clamoring for Blood Moon to going...meh. 

They're shooting themselves in the foot by hoarding old recharges and events instead of letting them go. The new suits are so shiny and nice that we as a server have our eye on them and forget all about the old stuff. That Elex gives us all the new events and tries to mix in the old ones shows us this (example: that ancient green and pink fairy event). 

Maybe they planned for it back when Nikki was new or its future on this server was uncertain, but this is no longer necessary. 

Their ""new things"" queue is way too long and now it just comes off as half hearted in a culture where even a skipped day of Twitter posts can lose a popular account hundreds of followers. They've been hemorrhaging their old players and the only thing keeping them afloat seems to be the new ones. That's not a good sign for long term. Did they just think they could earn and dump this game once it was unnecessary? 

Disney did a collab with Nikki. Disney. 

When a player is faced with too many options for recharge, a lot of us will become overwhelmed as we only have so much money to spend. Then we opt not to spend at all. Part of why Nikki does so well is because of how organized the CN server is in comparison. They've really honed it. Elex should follow their example (and scheduling) and adjust based on experience. There's a perfect template to follow for them. Maybe change three small things and call it an original if they're not supposed to follow step by step. That's what artists do 

If they could do better business wise than the original game company, I would say it is good to be careful and keep some aces in your hand...but Elex's capabilities are too low for this. They should take this opportunity to learn from this Nikki Games and utilize the experience. Then they can use it as a springboard for future game providing deals. At this point, their name reputation will become mud for English speaking players. Good luck getting good deals in the future. 

Integrity speaks for itself. 

Didn't they badly mess up this other game because of their mismanagement? They're clearly lacking in experience. Did they think other games won't see their history of game providing and just hand money making games over to an unreliable company? It's a surprise Nikki is still trusting them given how badly they have mismanaged this situation. 

It won't be too costly for them to do this either because this game in its original format has a lot to offer. Then they won't have to worry about scheduling. They're mostly caught up now given the mix of events. 

Get rid of the secret shop. It's clearly been a flop given event timing causes it to appear rarely. It's getting in the way of the new stuff. The roulette frustrates players as well. Dump it all in the clothing store and watch players go nuts and spend a their diamonds. Then give the cheaper old events lol. 

If not then display the months old recharges and then dump it in the clothing store. The original server is churning out all these new things and they need to get the spotlight. They need to fast fashion the hell out of these old clothes. 

They should just do a mass update and dump all the DW, Co-op, old recharges, and chapters on us."

LoveNikki,fk2cohc,t3_ffzh6b,1583798086.0,"Think of it this way. A moment of delay for a greater long term satisfaction. If we get all the changes we're pushing for (the rest of the dreamweavers, the backed up co-op suits, the missing chapters, old recharges in the store, the regular 360 diamonds a month every other sever has, the 400 Nikki anniversary diamonds ever other server got, and the welfare events that other servers get regularly and we only get when we protest...maybe even more crafting old event suits). If they could lower the outrageous diamond crafting prices, that would be good too. They've shafted us for this long and CN probably doesn't have such high prices. 

This game will be so fun for you and you'll have saved more cash than all of us who have been playing the game for a while. The only suits you may miss out on are new event suits and newer recharge suits, everything else will be at your disposal and you'll get new shiny future recharge suits in addition to all of that. That's the ideal, at least, assuming they listen and just hand it over already.

You'll get lots of nice fun welfare suits too. You'll be sitting on a veritable hoard in comparison to what we've got now and you'll be able to binge play the game for as long as your heart desires. 

These current recharges are definitely coming back. Look at how old Frost Rose is, or the bandit suit that they're selling for 99 cents (the latter is years old).  The recharges that should be readily available to you in the clothing store come back for cash, even when we don't want them to. 

I mean they might withold the beautiful white suit or change you more for it out of spite - I won't deny that, but...we are only given the very bare bones of this game. I think their greed will get the best of them and they'll re-offer this white suit sooner or later. I have seen Frost Rose (which was very popular when it first came out) so much that I no longer want it anymore. My eyes are tired of it.

The last major boycott made a huge difference - they removed ranking events entirely. If we push the envelope farther, like they've done for us, we'll have a similar effect if not greater. Hold your money, there's even nicer suits in the future."

Poor Emma got guilt tripped and threatened with hell (like the D&C chapter), would weep in remorse and fear, then pray and ponder about it and after some time, come back and say ""no, I'm not alright with it"". She'd do this rinse and repeat over and over. Perhaps the Lord was reassuring her. Even in the temple for proxy sealings, they'll ask the wife if she's ok with another woman joining in as a proxy. As a proxy!

LoveNikki,fjso16l,t3_fdksh0,1583599028.0,"I enjoyed your novel 👏👏👏. Elex is not doing a good job. They could be one of the richer servers if they actually listened and treated us fairly. On pushing, of course I think it's frustrating to have to keep pushing but I think what is really getting in the way here is fear of ""not being nice"" and ""being too demanding"" and we need to let that one go. We've been undercutting ourselves and it's time to stop that. Stop worrying about how we come across and focus on what we can do. 

I think there's two things we should focus on: 
1. Increased diamonds 

Getting that will make a huge difference in our player base. It may help tempt some back. 

2. Welfare suits 

We are so backed up it's not even funny and they're screwing themselves over with this - either they give it to us in a flood, not at all, or they should start giving it to us slowly before they're so backed up they're forced go give it in a flood and look like idiots.

They're scheduling is all over the place. They're better off not saving this events for a rainy day but just handing them over next to expensive events. 

Then there are two basic necessities that they'd be stupid to forget: 

1. Regularity of the dreamweavers, new chapters, and community chapters & co-op suits. 

People are incredibly bored with this game right now. Special events are not everything and they've been rolling one after another out to the point that we go ""been there, done that"". 

2. Return of past outfits 

They are beginning to do this but this amount is scanty. Some say scanty clothing is sexy, but I think it is boring. Some people would be happy to throw their diamonds into crafts because that's what they like to do - so long as the pricing remains the same as CN, which is to say that it is fair. They can have more clothes, they have more reason to play, and then Nikki does the rest. 

Honestly, the devs do not appear to recognize that the original Nikki by design is a very fun game. So long as you make it fair, the game will naturally interest players and money will come fairly easily. This is because they're a bigger fandom and here, people like to support companies and games they like (and because Nikki is just that addicting). 

Their current behavior has led players like me refusing to spend money until the game is enjoyable again. Many of us have left, but some of us stick around precisely because we like the original game. That's a huge pull and it irritates me on a visceral level to see Elex wasting that. Literally all they had to do was play it with original scheduling. We would've been fine, maybe a little impatient - so hit some new events yeah, but we would've kept playing. 

At this point, all they can do is give is the diamonds then release more past event outfit crafting in greater number ever update (watch that difference in diamond amount be slowly eaten up by this resource), roll out the chapters and dreamweavers and community stuff until we are caught up (newbies will take longer to finish, thus play longer before losing interest - diamond heavy events can turn off newbies who aren't into the game yet), and give us welfares. 

The welfare suits look different from event suits. Good quality but not nearly as fancy. They're going to make players satisfied but they will never replace the sparkly event suits. They'll just make the game seem more approachable and ""they're so generous with is that I really want to support them"". 

Then they can sneak in the old events at the same time and still not lose player interest. That resolves their issue of the old event outfits looking stale and underwhelming beside the new stuff. 

It's not like Elex doesn't have more money makers - dark skinned makeup and poses, the gorgeous new events and recharges, new events and collabs, etc. 

They seem to forget that the original Nikki is also in the business of making money...so they'll keep rolling out great was for them to earn money. All they have to do is trust original Nikki because original CN will constantly roll out bigger and better. There's no need for a scarcity mindset in a game this popular and diverse in outfits. 

If they want to be creative, they just need to resolve our glaring issues, make us feel heard, and watch suggestions fly into their mail box (dark skinned makeup, for example, I think there may have been others but I forgot). 

Elex just needs to make that plunge. If they can do this, they'll draw in lots of old players who left. If they can maintain equal treatment, old players will stay and players will recommend the game. They have it in themselves to be one of the bigger servers of they aren't already but their success has been so so in comparison to what they could be. Why? Because they are holding back when they shouldn't be. Bigger is better for us."
