In fact, *bombing* planets will become like the firebombing or nuking of cities during WWII. I think banning something like that would be nearly impossible as that acquiring the necessary technology wouldn't take much if humanity is that advanced. More likely, the situation would be that every power has that technology, but fears using it cause then every other military power would turn on them. Like the Cold War between the U.S. and the USSR. Nikola Tesla claimed to be able to create ray guns (or cannons) and prior to WWII and wanted to give every European power there own arsenal because he thought it would prevent war.

Likewise, Margaret Thatcher argued that had not the nuclear bomb been invented, humanity would have killed itself. Owing to that because conventional warfare had reached a point where it could wipe out an entire generation of men, but political leaders still saw that loss as acceptable. However, nuclear warfare was so irrationally terrifying that it prevented a major war for nearly a half-a-century. She contended that because nuclear warfare was perceived to have the power to wipe out humanity that the threat of it actually happening was near-zero. Naturally, she was against the disarmament of nukes as that it would most likely invoke a terrible war.

So in your story, conventional warfare would still exist, but no one would dare use otherwise they'd be dead."

A trick I learned about writing characters is to create them with  [mimetic desires](https://violenceandreligion.com/mimetic-theory/). In a nutshell, mimetic theory argues that people get their desires or goals from other people. The best writers, like Shakespeare and Dostoevsky, create characters who have some sort of obsession about another person. Luke desires to become a Jedi because his father was one. Frodo goes on an adventures to destroy the ring because Bilbo went on an adventure to slay the dragon Smough. There are other motivations, but the psychological basis for both Luke and Frodo is that they want to be like someone they admire. It is from this imitation that the character gets their purpose and their goal and from where the conflict of the story comes from.

I could be completely wrong, but there has to be a cutoff date where an applicants previous GPA, SAT, GRE, LSAT... etc., is not required to be reported. Because as time progresses those scores would not be accurate description of those applicants abilities. Then how could you accurately determine GPA averages? You can't reasonably compare a person who got a bachelors a year prior to another who got theirs ten years ago. Each earned them under different circumstances.

So I think what happens is that most law school applicants fit within the early-to-mid twenties. You reasonably could group their GPAs together. Though if they all came from different undergrad programs you really couldn't. How could you rightfully compare the GPA of an engineering major to an English major? But, in any case, its close enough I guess. One would have to assume that not all applicants fit within this net and the admission offices do not include them in their public reporting. Statistics just do not work if you have so many outliers in them and statisticians are just magi of this age.

There has to be an agreement between schools and the accreditation organizations that X amount of students do not have to be reported and are not included in the rankings. Otherwise, schools, particularly elite schools, would have a ridiculously small pool to choose students from and those students who do not fit into that pool would go elsewhere. This would lead to other non-elite schools over taking the elite schools and becoming elite themselves and creating their own accreditation organization and returning full circle.

Both Tolkien and C.S. Lewis used fairytales and fantasy as a metaphor for Christianity. Following in the spirity of the writer George MacDonald who Lewis says began him on the path to Christianity after he read MacDonald's book Phantasies. Both Tolkien and Lewis began what is the modern Fantasy genre and they eleborated on what they though magic was. Lewis in his book *Miracles* creates a rational arguement for the existience of magic and miracles. You have to read the book to understand his full argument, but simply explained. For Lewis magic was an *outer force*. That is, for him, the natural world which contained physics, chemistry, biology... etc., was merely a small part of creation. And that the Divine was a force that lived outside of the universe. Magic, according to Lewis's definition, was an outside power that interfered or directed the natural laws of our universe. And from there he goes on and explains free-will.

Both Tolkien and Lewis argued that it was the mundane world, and not the fantasy world, that was supernatural. Rather, it was fairyland and all of its magic, that was more natural. That magic was not an interfering force, but a correcting one. And that magic if allowed to would bring the mundane world back to its true natural state which is one that was attuned to the will of Divine."

Also, it breaks from the cannon established by previous cartoons, comics, books and games. I liked it a lot, but if you're going to analyze it from conistency with cannon then it doesn't make sense. For me its weak points are stronger than its good points. 

Rebels I didn't like as much, but there were parts in the show that were awesome. Like when Ezra says ""I'm not afraid of you"" to Darth Vaders and he replies, ""then you'll die braver then most."" The helicopter lightsabers were stupid and it was at that point I realized the creators of the show did not care. I detest what they did with Thrawn. They made Thrawn look like a idiot and I don't like how he has pupils in his eyes. The time travel arc was very stupid and seriously who thought it would be a good idea to have the emperor stand in front of a magic portal and shoot fire from a cauldron! Why didn't the emperor just reach out and choke them or drag them off the bridge? Seriously, Star Wars has never had time travel (and Darth Rivan and that one book doesn't count since they weren't cannon (at least Darth Rivan and his magic scepter never was)) The magic whale at the end that ate Thrawn was embarrassing. Timothy Zahn must have been pissed at all the work he has to do now to explain that crap.

And the real problem with TCW is of course Ahsoka. She doesn't make sense. Why would the council force an apprentice on Anakin? Why would there have no mention of her in the prequel films? If you want to have Ahsoka then don't make her Anakin's apprentice. Just make her another Jedi who lived during the Republic and fought in the clone wars.

When McConnel blocked Garland he did so under the the 'Biden Rule.' This Senate rule was created by then-senator Joe Biden and it simply holds that a Supreme Court Justice should not be appointed during an election year. That the selection of a Supreme Court Justice should be a factor that the American people should consider when they go to the polls to vote for the Presidency. Further, McConnel did not abuse his power (nor could he) because the Senate approves Judges. As Majority leader, McConnel can choose to block any person for judgeship for any reason whatsoever. The precedent has been the Senate does (unless the individual is woefully unqualified) approve who ever the President appoints. It used to be that Judges and Justices were chosen by hand vote without any hearing and all Justices typically got a nearly unanimous appointment. However, with Robert Bork the Democrats changed the rules. They torpedoed a man and besmirched his repution which until then had been stellar (top lawyer at the best Chicago firm, Yale professor, judge on a prestigious appellate court) by claiming that he would undue Roe v. Wade and send women to do abortions in the alley way. These were of course horrible and disgusting lies. They tried to do the same to Clarence Thomas (who resisted them) but Biden failed to kill his appointment. Since then any Republican Justice has had none or limited Democratic support while the Republican still vote for Democrat judges who they feel are qualified. McConnell's actions have been squarely within the Constitution. And might i say, McConnel did support many of Obama's appointments. Something that Schumer has never done for Trump; so much for bipartianship. 
The Conservative bench has never had a 'real majority,' trust me this is a common complaint among Conservatives lawyers. If they had, Roe v. Wade would be long gone.
Are you serious with the emoluments clause? That is mostly to prevent Americans from receiving 'noble title' (like being made a Duke or a Count or whatever) it doesn't prevent American politicans from accepting donations. If that were the case then most of the politicans in Congress would be in jail. Trump can hardly prevent foreign officials from using his hotels. And if they believe that will buy them some influence, then they are woefully mistaken. 
You can hardly blame McConnel for trying to fill vacant judge slots in the courts. That's part of his job as majority leader. If you disagree with his appoints that is fine, but please don't delude yourself into thinking that he is somehow breaking the rules  by doing this. I don't know what you mean by 'partisan' judges.

2. Joseph McCarthy violated the Constitutional liberties of thousands of Americans. However, many of the individuals on his *lists* were communists who did spy for the USSR and document found after the collapse of the USSR does show there was an effort in the media to discredit McCarthy. I do think McCarthy is unfairly demonized in the history books, but I do not deny he did wrong to innocent people.
3. John Lennon was a fanastically talented singer and musician who made no bones that he was a marxist. *Imagine* is a song where he describes a marxist utopia. Personally, I don't think it one of his better works.

As for the rest of it, honestly I just wrote it to be satirical. Thanks for asking!"

In the 1950s, Joseph McCarthy attempted to route them out, but he was foiled by Soviet spies and their plants in the media. His good name was unjustifly and faslely tarnished. Since then their goal has been to destroy America and establish a Communist dictatorship. With the Chinese virus going around many see this as an opportunity to bring forth their long awaited goals into action. The song *imagine* is a song written by John Lennon where he attempts to describe a (godless) world where the nation state does not exist and a communist utopia exists. Lefties have used this song as their battle cry and celebrities, by singing it, are letting the sleeping soviet spies that the time is now. Their disloyality to America sickens me."

StarWarsEU,fl2uipw,t1_fl2lyq7,1584760259.0,"Anakin already had that development in the books, comics and the 2-D cartoon show. TCW just throws a wreck in those works. I don't dislike Ahsoka as a character (aside from the obvious fact that she is jailbait) but she doesn't work as Anakin's apprentice. It doesn't make sense for Anakin to have an apprentice. Again, why would the apprentice force the master into a leadership role. A jedi gets an apprentince because they are already are a leader and they teach the apprentice to be a leader also.

In the kids books that came out during the time of the films, a Jedi master choosing an apprentice was a very important decision. The master would test the younglings and try to find someone that matched their personality and had similar ability. In TCW, the council dumps Ahsoka onto Anakin without his awareness of it. I guess you could say 'well its a war they need more jedi,' but it seems odd to junt a child onto a batlefield with an experience jedi knight. Again, Anakin had been an apprentice himself three months ago and he was a winy little brat. Techincally, Obiwan was still a padawan when he took Anakin up as his apprentice, but Obiwan was a mature jedi who was the level of a jedi knight himself and Quigon acknowledged that he had little to teach Obiwan. So the difference between the two is very stark. You have Ahsoka thrusted onto this emotionally unstable jedi and then you had Obiwan who was a mature almost-a-full-knight individual who took Anakin up as an apprentice to adherence to his master's dying wish.

All in all, Ahsoka only exists because Filoni wanted her. Lore and narrative structure be damned!"

OutOfTheLoop,fkvmigv,t1_fkvlfp7,1584572252.0,"But how does the lack of automation in China result in automation not taking place elsewhere?

If automation is a money saver then manufacturers can go to literally anywhere else. A low population country would accept them for the tax revenue. 

The answer, I think, is that automation is either not advanced enough, too expensive... etc., so manufactuerers turn to China because it has a large workforce that is cheap."

OutOfTheLoop,fkve4f9,t1_fkt7wzw,1584567371.0,"As I said, regardless of level of automation the manufacturing and other industry  may, or may not, adopt. There will always be a need for a human factor. Namely, that you need mechanics and engineers to keep the automated machines functioning. Further, we do not yet know how far automation will be adopted in the market place. Why is the assumpt that automation is to suplant human workers rather than act as a tool to support it?

I think your argument is flawed on its premise, that China's population is what is causing it to avoid automation. Adding automated features to manufacturing (as I said above) does not necessarily mean that workers become unnecessary. Rather, it could enhance the output of a manufacturer without needing to cost individuals a livelihood. 

Also, if China did automate their manufacturing industry, they could force their population to enlist in their military and begin a series of military interventions or start a massive war. Assuming that the leadership doesn't care about their population's wellbeing, having a large chunk of their population die in a war that may add territorty to China could be beneficial to the leadership.

I am very suspicious of A.I. developers. They come across more as *mystics* than scientists. A.I. will come and have an impact, but it most likely won't be as dramatic as everyone says it will be. However, A.I. isn't the all be answer for the world's problems it is a tool like any other."

The answer is that while automation, in some form, is coming there will always a need for a workforce in the manufacturing industry. Thus, people go to China because of cheap laber and reasons related to currency. If automation was the future and was going to happen soon. Why wouldn't the companies build factories in America or in the country where the product is going to be sold in and just man it with automation robots?

This is beside the fact that someone will be need to fix the machines and that could very well take a massive workforce of its own."

PrequelMemes,fkp0n3u,t1_fkoxiuj,1584399144.0,"It is my honor, and duty, as a Master to teach young padawans and guide them when they have been led astray. Like many young Star Wars fans you know much that isn't so. Yes, the Star Wars EU is, or was imperfect, but it was nonetheless mostly entirely consistent. When the Prequel films was launched, Lucasfilms launched a massive project that created a very well organized timeline in that era. All the content associated with the film was carefully organized and maintained this includes all the books, comics, games and cartoons that were associated with the Prequels. While some of the post-RoTJ content was pruned most of that still lined up and almost nothing from the Old Republic era was altered. The way it worked was that if it had the Lucasfilm licensing brand on it, it was a part of the cannon. Lucas approved of all of this and was involved with various aspects of the project at different levels. Dialogue in the Prequels directly references events that happened between the films, but was featured in the EU. Characters in the EU were also given cameo appearances in the films. One of Lucas's favorite characters, Quilin Voss, was in the Star Wars comics and Lucas loved him so much that when the comics were going to kill Voss off at the end of his arc Lucas intervened and made them keep Voss alive. 

Literally, if you read the EU content that spans millenia across the Star Wars timeline. The different authors and creators all reference one another. It is actually really impressive that Lucasfilm managed to maintain such a tight cannon. Were some of the stories repetative? Sure, but they weren't the same exact story! You just don't know anything about the Star Wars EU

Your quote above matches what I am saying perfectly. The EU is something that flows from the films and is kind of its own thing, but stays true to the film. When Lucas says its a different universe he isn't being literal, young padawan. It is a figure of speech, stop misrepresenting George. There are other quotes from Lucas, and other people involved, that directly contradict what you are saying. You do not know what you are talking about at all because you never dealt with the EU content. That is fine, but go talking about something you are totally ignorant about. If you want to learn watch the video down below. This guy actually gets it and notes all the things about the Star Wars cannon that were changed by Filoni's show that I noticed immediatley once I watched it.

Now go medidate padawan or wank your lightsaber off.
